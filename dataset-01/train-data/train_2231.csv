1,Not so hot.,I put this on a bb pistol I have for killing stinking ground squirrels.I cannot adjust the unit to be accurate at 10 feet. Could be the gun too.
4,Electric Violin purchase,All items were sent as shown in the package. Delivery was within 7 days. Quality of product was average.
5,Life in Death,"Eric Daniels new book The Greatest People I Never Knew is the compilation of thirteen essays about people he cared for in his funeral service. It unveils how one seasoned funeral director is still learning about life through caring for the dead and the living.From the vibrant 13-year old boy, who died several hours after his grandmother's funeral to the tax collector a whole town loved, Daniels chronicles his encounters with the recently bereaved. From a Loudon sawmillowner, readers learn of a man that lived by his greatest virtue, honesty.Alan C. Minery was notorious for giving extra pieces of lumber to clients, stating, ""just in case a piece or two weren't quite right."" This is how Mr. Minery is remembered and this is how Daniels and the readers meet him, through a profound remembrance of honesty and kindness.Daniels says that the book to him exemplifies Mark Twains? belief that people should ""endeavor so to live that when we come to die, even the undertaker will be sorry."" I agree!"
1,Does Not Play on Windows XP,"Pool CHAMP 3D by Gamesoft - identical game as sold by Snap!Game is clearly identified as ""Windows 93se - Me - XP"" - and ""Windows XP COMPATIBLE"".Yet the game does not play on my PC with Windows XP, service pack 3 (SP3)."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this tea thinking it would have a rich, exotic taste. I was disappointedas it is not a full bodied taste but kind of light and flowery, at least to mytaste buds. I used it as an ingredient in baking cookies and it worked wellin that capacity."
1,Hot Leaf Juice! I disliked this brand of Jasmine Tea,"I wanted to try Jasmine Tea, I ordered this one but didn't want to wait for it to come in so I bought Jasmine Tea at my local Whole Foods. That tea was wonderful so I was looking forward to making my own at home. After trying this tea I was disgusted, it was not as smooth as other Jasmine Tea I had tried before and after tasting this one. It has a wonderful scent, but I want tea, not potpourri. In short after made it isn't tea, but Hot Leaf Juice. I don't like the this tea, and will not buy any other Yamamotoyama teas. Jasmine Tea is wonderful, floral, and sweet. If you do want to drink Jasmine Tea try a different brand."
4,fabulous read,This is such an encouraging book. I found the insight into mormonism extremely helpful. I found his journey into Christianity refreshing.
1,Non-functional slicer,"This egg slicer would seem to be a smart design since it will do slices and wedges. However, the wires consistently get snagged in the slots and break. Also, it does not accomodate jumbo eggs well."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"This basket is very small. I wanted to use it for bananas in my kitchen but turns out it is much too small for that. Also the ""silver-looking"" TIN basket portion is actually painted BLUE and looks very cheap. Not worth $17.00."
1,What a joke!,"Wow! What a disappointment. It looks like a chintzy party decoration. It didn't stay in my house until nightfall. I cannot stress enough how cheap this thing looks. I thought maybe on a shelf at a distance it would look as good as it does on the Amazon site, but no. Regardless of how far away I stood from it, it still looked trashy."
1,BELONGS IN THE TRASH!!,"I bought this item thinking it was cute and I could use it in my kitchen. I was wrong. This basket is probably the junkiest piece of garbage I have ever bought on Amazon. For the price I definitely wasn't expecting Longaberger but I thought it would be better quality than this. They aren't kidding when they say ""tin"". The tail and head are as flimsy as a soda can. Easy to bend and break. The colors aren't vibrant and almost look chalky. It's really not good for anything that I can think of. I waited and didn't send it back so now this beauty is mine. I have it in the back of a cabinet holding tealight candles. It will make it's way to the trash can some day in the near future I'm sure. Save your money on this one."
5,Rooster Decor,"I gave this to my 37 year old daughter, for Christmas. Her decor in her kitchen is Rooster stuff. When she got this statue, she just loved it and said that it was a perfect touch. The size, color and durability is just right. Anyone who gets this item I'm sure will be satisfied. Very attractive addition for thoses who like roosters. I do!"
1,The most biased and exaggrated book I have ever read!,I have recently read this book for my English class and I would have dropped it into the waste bin if it hadn't been my homework. Keenan's style is so egotistic and exaggrated you can't stand the book. His inner conflicts and complexes are all around the book. He keeps swapping between slang and his so-called academic language.
2,not what I expected,"This book is from the 70s. It was not at all what I expected or wanted. I thought it would be the HISTORY of sanitation, and it's not. I gave it to the goodwill."
5,Love this vest!,"A great vest for the money! The sizing seems to be right on, the shipping was quick and the jacket is cute (and warm, too)."
3,"Nice and warm, but sheds feathers all day long","This is a well made vest, very comfortable and it has become a favorite of mine. The downside is that it sheds mercilessly. Little white feather here, little white feather there- poking out of the nylon. Not the most attractive situation, but I suppose vests are for us outdoorsy folks who don't mind shedding a bit. Consider your vanity level before purchasing...the shedding isn't so bad that it would prevent me from buying it again, but at any given time there is a spot or two of white trying to get out."
2,Not so great- but a decent price,No way was this ever a $ 80 dollar product!Vest is just OK..but what do you want for the price. You are better off buying one from Land's end for a few more dollars. Reversible- but unable to use one side because the down comes out.I might try to return this..but the color is nice- not bright red- but more of a cranberry.Over all - cheap quality
2,Too much feathers!!!,"I was initially attracted by the price. When I receive it in the mail, My first impression when I tried it on was-- wow! this is really comfortable ! But after an hour of wearing it, my husband and daughter had to help me de-lint my shirt, or Shall I say de-feather! The vest is now getting flat from all of the feather that's coming out!!!"
5,Vest,"The feathers fall out a lot at first, but with wear they fall into place. I still LOVE it! It's very comfortable and reversable, which makes it easy to match to outfits."
2,Comfortable but.....,I bought this vest because it was cheap. Buyer beware that this molts/sheds feathers like crazy. Won't purchase again because I shed all over my furniture and car seats.
3,Not too bad ...,For the price this wasn't bad .. but the feathers are poking through the material giving it an off 'dandruff' style look.Up to you if you think this is OK ...!
5,Enlightened,"A great book, covers many firearms. It is a wonderful reference, and will soon be a collector's item."
1,Not worth the money,"I coach 7th and 8th grade girls basketball. I had high hopes for this book when I ordered it directly from the author. I bought it assuming that it might be helpful for our CYO program. It wasn't. After taking a look at it, I decided not to share it with either parents or fellow coaches. I was able to locate free publications from CYO and materials from our AAU program that handle the sportsmanship issues better. I believe that this book was represented to be more than it was. The author may have had good intentions, but this book just doesn't deliver."
5,Dionne Goes Gospel with Compelling Results,"What an excellent gospel record by Dionne Warwick.She sounds right at home throughout this album and delivers some amazing operatics and hits some notes I'd never heard her hit before! I adore her version of ""Battle Hymn of the Republic"" and wish she included more verses, but the chosen parts of the song coupled with her simple yet captivating arrangement is just bliss on the ears.A MUST for all Warwick fans as well as those who enjoy heartfelt gospel music."
5,Great Music...... Another plus for a great show!,Great Music...... Another plus for a great show! They are helping people find and make not so popular artist well known!
5,I really like this album...,"I like the album a lot because it has some of my favorite artists (Story of the Year, Butch Walker). And it also has newer artists that I know of because of the show (Tyler Hilton, etc). If you enjoy the music on ""One Tree Hill"" and how it conveys the emotions of the characters, then you will enjoy this album!"
3,Too random for my taste.,"As one of the original fans of One Tree Hill, I was very surprised when I read the track listing for this soundtrack. Evidently, the WB was bent on promoting new artists, rather than the ones who contributed important songs to the show. A better soundtrack might have included ""Calling All Angels"" by Train, ""She Will Be Loved"" by Maroon 5, or ""Dare You To Move"" by Switchfoot. To be fair, Gavin Degraw's ""I Don't Want to Be,"" One Tree Hill's theme song, is present here, as is ""The First Cut is the Deepest"" by Sheryl Crow, which she performed when she guest starred on the show. These are both pivotal songs. Keane's ""Everybody's Changing"" is a nice addition to the soundtrack, but other than, the songs are random, more so than should be tolerable for a true fan of One Tree Hill."
1,Wow this is a stinker,"Other than the fact that this soundtrack has ""Overdue"" by The Get Up Kids from their album On A Wire and ""Kill"" by Jimmy Eat World this thing sucks. I mean honestly it has a cover version of ""When the Stars Go Blue"" this song is maybe 4 years old and was original written and released on ""Gold"" by Ryan Adams. This version is a bastardized version and sounds like any other acousticish nu metal song. Gavin Degraw were do I start? This guys voice is as annoying as they come I rank him up there with other phrat boy singer songwriters like Jack Johnson, Dave Matthews, and Ben Harper. Then we get to Story of the Year, one of the worst bands in the pop punk/screamo category to date. These guys have ripped off ever good band I know in the catergory and made their songs into nu metal songs with goofy lyrics. This cd is a turd go buy Jimmy Eat World ""Futures,"" The Get Up Kids ""On A Wire,"" and Ryan Adams ""Gold"" and leave this waste of money alone."
5,The WB makes so much great soundtracks!...,"I love the show since the first second and was waiting for the soundtrack to be available.It's the case now and i'm not disappointed at all!...All the songs are great and some of them are inedit versions which gives more credit to this CD because it's not just a compilation,it's real mix with a spirit (the lyrics of each songs can be relate to the atmosphere of the serie and its characters).As a Michelle Branch i was glad to hear her new song and can't wait for the weckers to have their album available.I love bethany joy lenz's voice and was a little disappointed that her version of elswhere wasn't on the CD...But gladly,her duet with tyler hilton is!...Anyway,it's a really great CD so buy it!"
4,One Tree Hill Soundtrack,"This is a great CD! I love listening to it in the car, before bed and at work. A lot of great songs, but I must say the second soundtrack is the best! I feel they are both must have in your collection."
5,Some of the best songs from the show!,"Great CD! I love that they put ""When the Stars go Blue"" by Tyler and Bethany on this CD! I've heard other versions of that song, but really love their version!! It was basically the reason I bought the CD, but have come to enjoy listening the whole CD! ""Glad"" by Tyler Hilton is probably my second favorite song. I've become a fan of his since the show. ""Sidewalks"" by Story of the Year is also a memorable song from the show, as is ""Everybody's Changing"" by Keane and ""Mixed Tape"" by Butch Walker. If you don't recognize them by name, you will when you hear them. I highly recommend this CD to any fan or anybody that enjoys a great mix of music!!"
4,OTH Rocks!,Great CD. Lot's of good songs and good choice on the live version of I Don't Want To Be. Would recommend to anyone.
3,"Good CD, but...","I think this it's a great CD, represents all the music of this gread Serie, just one thing that i don't like, the principal song ""I Don't Want To Be - Gavin DeGraw"" It's a Live Versión, not the studio Versión and in this versón it isn't really a good song.SEE YA!!!"
5,fantastic!,"this soundtrack is a must have. it's the only cd that has both ""when the stars go blue"" by tyler hilton and bethany joy lenz AND the acoustic version of tyler's song ""glad!"" (gavin's also a big plus!!) allllso, if you haven't gone to a one tree hill gig, then you're really missin out as well... it's by far one of the best tours that i've ever been to! and while i'm at it... you should pick up tyler's album the tracks of b/c it's the best cd that's came out within the past year! trust me on that one! :D"
5,Popcorn Salt,I ordered this product because I had difficulty finding it in the grocery stores. I will definitely order from this company again.
5,GOOD,I NEEDED IT FOR A BOOK REVIEW AND IT DID JUST EXACTLY WHAT i NEEDED IT TO DO. i WOULD ORDER IT AGAIN IF i NEEDED TOO!!!!
4,A must read for those interested in JIT,"This book encompasses all the main issues of JIT which are covered deeply. Even so, the writing style is overly dense and it makes hard to go through the text. It's a reference book on all the literature in inventory but a bit out of date."
3,Bryan Jones - Step Back,"Solid 2-step garage house from Bryan Jones, with just enough funk to keep things interesting. ""Pictures & Sounds"" has a surprising sweetness to it, while ""Round 2"" and ""Natural Sound"" introduce looped divas. The robo-funk of ""Space Cake"" doesn't quite work, unfortunately, but the cut-up voices on ""Time is Now"" and the filtered chords on ""Let It Go"" carry the bounce. Good clean fun throughout."
5,excellent!,"The box was carefully packed and arrived within three days of shipping. The satsuma tangerines were sweet, slightly tart, easy to peel and almost all seedless. We enjoy these every year over the winter season and will be back to Taylor's for their great product and customer service!"
2,Not the worst thing I ever read,"The heroine in this novel comes across as ""look at how strong and independent I am"" in the preview when in reality she's just stupid. The male MC isn't too bright either. At one point in the novel he sneaks into her room where she's under lock and key. They have ""relations"" not once but twice and then he tells her that he doesn't have time to rescue her until the next night. Of course the next night there was an ambush waiting so she couldn't be rescued.If you like the type of novel where the two MCs do nothing but fight while they are secretly madly in love/lust with each other and then they come together for no apparent reason you'll like this novel.The only reason why this got two stars from me is because the external plot involving Elizabeth I was researched and accurate."
4,wonderful,Not much to say..... just read it! You will fall in love with the characters. I wish I had my own Burke.
3,I almost gave it four stars,"I didn't in any way think this was a bad book, and I would still recommend this to those who love to read romance. For me, I enjoyed the plot and the overall story. I loved the setting. The descriptions were excellent and the characters shared good dialogue. What made me leave this book a three star review was more the repetition between the two main characters. I respect that there has to be tension and conflict in any good romance, but in this book I felt there was more tension that romance and then the romance just kind of came out of left field.What I really did like about this book was the writing style of the author. Her setting is so beautiful and she has built her story around a fascinating time in history. If the romance had been a bit more balanced I would have given this four or five stars. All in all it was still an enjoyable read that I think others would like."
2,What?,"The ""far off shores of Ireland""? From *England*? Someone needs to take some geography lessons before they write any more books."
3,cool adaptor,"My wife and I acquired this really beautiful headboard, which didn't match our bed frame, and this product solved this problem pronto! Works great!"
5,Works as expected. Quality product,"These brackets are made of quality material and worked with the footboard extension brackets I purchased from another merchant. I had an ""unique situation"" and I was able to make it work with these brackets."
3,This product is ok.,It is convinient but don't cook eggs it makes a mess. Once you use it its impossible to get it totally clean there is always some sort of stain left behind.
3,Intresting but edited,"While I found this DVD intresting, it has been edited for the dvd release.The controversial pictures of Diana in the car has been blurredand are not shown at all. Just a warning"
1,Its a watch it once,"Don't expect much, if you order this video. It is more about the people selling pictures of Diana then it is about the title of the video."
4,Great for the money!,"If you use it for what you are suppose to use it for (which is to rock your baby, and if you are not 500lbs) its great. Yes there are alot of nicer, prettier ones out there but you are going to pay alot more for them. I say save your money for other expenses, like pampers and formula! Sowhat!"
1,Hate it!,"I purchased this glider because it seemed good for the price. Horrible choice. I regret getting this because the craftmanship is horrible. The arm rest have started to shift and the glider has started to shift to the side. Its not a good idea to buy a light color especially when stains occur.As a second time mom, spend an additional 100 or 150 dollars and get a glider of good quality."
4,Great Chair for the Price!,"For $150.00, you can't beat it! I have used the glider every day for over a year, and it is still in great shape. The cushions are not exactly the most comfortable in the world; they are definitely on the thinner side of things. Also, the glider does not recline so it is not a chair for an adult to fall asleep in. The chair itself, however, is very sturdy...well worth the money!"
5,Practically Perfect,"We love this chair. It has come in so handy during our first 10 months. It's been slept in a few times and the cushion is just as comfortable as it was the first day we bought it.The only problem we've had (and it could be human error during assembly) is the squeakiness. After 6 months of practically perpetual motion, the chair started to squeak. For some reason, though, now it has stopped! Whatever the reason, we're glad for it.The chair is wonderful! It's inexpensive, but not cheap and I love that the arms are cushioned. I'm also so glad that the ottoman is part of the cost and that it moves with the glider. I had no idea how important that would be to me.I definitely recommend getting this chair!"
5,Very comfortable Glider/ottoman set,The Glider/Ottoman was purchased for my elderly mom and she loves it. the whole glider has a nice cushion that surrounds her as she sits. She mostly loves the arm rest cushions they are truly the best. An so easy to assemble. We are sincerely happy with this purchase its a good Glider/ottoman for the price didn't have to spend so much money for good quality
4,Great for the price,"I am happy I did not go out and spend a lot of money on one of these, because I am quite happy with this chair, especially given the price. It definitely serves the purpose intended..."
5,What a bargain!,"I just received this glider/ottoman as a gift at my baby shower and love it! The fabric appears durable, the wood is gorgeous, and the motion is smooth. I can't wait to use the chair while feeding my baby and rocking him/her to sleep. For now, I am using it for naps. This chair gives a lot of bang for your buck!"
1,Ouch!,"Now that we've used duct tape to secure a half-inch of foam pipe insulation around the hard wooden arms whose knobs protude in dangerous proximity to the baby's head while he's nursing, this is a perfectly serviceable, though unattractive and rather narrow, glider."
4,Glider/Ottoman Combo,"We built this Glider last night and I think it's a great deal. I haven't had my baby yet but I know it's going to be one of the best purchases that I make. The motion on the glider and the ottoman is very smooth. The chair is completely comfortable, I have trouble sleeping and this put me out within 20 minutes. It was easy to put together, the ottoman came assembled and the only thing we had to do was put on the back of the chair, the arms, and the cushions. The one thing that I didn't like was the color of the cushions, they don't really compliment the color of the wood. Other than that it's a great deal."
4,Good Gilder bad customer service,"We got this glider as a gift. Once we began to but it together we noticed that the base of the glider was missing the holes for the screws. I called customer service, they siad they send out a new base no problem. I called to check back on it they where very rude and tok me to just wait. It been a month and we finally got the base and it the wrong one. The office is always closed so I have to wait another six week. At this rate my unborn daughter will be outting it together her self. So far he parts that we have together are great."
4,Good for price,"We just put this glider together and it seems like everything is OK with it. You get both the glider and ottoman for $150 rather than $300 to $500 for others which is nice. It glides smoothly and is very quiet. It was also very easy to put together. The color seems to match the picture online and is nice because its neutral. My only complaint (and its not toward BRU or Amazon) is that even though it came from the factory the back pad on ours was already somewhat dirty, also one of the buttons on the arm was damaged and doesn't snap. We've called the manufacturer and they were very nice and will send a replacement part hassle free.P.S. for the woman whos glider was already assembled but falling apart, the manufacturer's customer service number is 1-800-295-1980 or email at das@dorel.com"
4,"Narrow seat, but a good deal","This is a good quality glider for a great price. My only complaint is that the seat is so narrow, you can't use a boppy pillow while breastfeeding. If that is important to you, get a larger glider."
2,good for a few months,"We were so happy to find this combo. The price was just perfect. The chair is definitely narrow but it was comfortable for me. I wondered why the price was so much cheaper than the other chairs besides the fact that the cushioning was lacking and it did not glide as quickly or, should I say, as smoothly as the other more expensive gliders. Then after 5 months of use the arm started to break. Even though we got 5 months of use out of it we wish we spent the extra couple hundred dollars on a better glider. We are now shopping for a more comfortable(better cushioned) and higher quality chair. My advice to those considering to purchase this is to spend the extra money on a better chair unless your funds are very limited. Keep in mind that you do get what you pay for."
4,"Practical, but not comfortable","I have had this chair for three years now. It has held up well through one baby, continual adult use (in living room) and one move. It is very practical for someone who needs to spend less than 300 dollars on a chair! I find that the lighter color is easily stained, but also since the padding is thin it is easily cleaned!But the thin padding is a downer too! My rear end gets tired from sitting on it after about fifteen minutes... I can live with that, but it isnt the most comfortable chair.Also, for nursing the arms were too low for me, I needed pillows for props, I am 5'5"".All in all a decent buy."
3,if you like sleeping upright,"we got this with our first baby who is now 3 yrs old. i used it at first for one month.we moved when she was a month old. by the time we got our stuff delivered she was about almost 3 months old and got longer. so this wasn't working that well. plus it was upstairs for me to run upstairs everytime she needed to be nursed was insane. it was good for nightime feedings that my husband didnt' bring her to me and i got up with her to rock her back down, but she would hit her head or feet on the wooden arm rests. that is the main reason i don't like it. so for my 2nd baby i just got a real recliner and rocker chair. and when she would pass out i just raised the foot rest and slept there with her. it was much better and more comfortable than a glider."
2,Glider/Ottoman Combo,"Ugly color in person. Really small distance from arm to arm. I could never fit my newborn and Boppy when I sat down to breastfeed. It was a VERY tight squeeze. The left arm broke after 2 years of owning it. Uncomfortable, rough texture fabric. Always covered with a blanket. Not a great buy at all."
3,Okay for the price,"I like this glider, but it's a little snug. Because of the way the arm cushions are, there isn't much room in the chair."
3,ottoman/glider combo,"Glider was great, ottoman was poorly made and the wood grain going in the wrong direction so the huge crack that it arrived with couldn't be repaired. Too late to send it back as it was a gift for the next day..."
3,"It's true, it does not have the part","Though the picture says otherwise, This yoga strap does not have the silver metal part at the end of strap."
3,"Worked as expected, cheaper at Lowe's","Items received in good packaging and worked as expected. I saw the same item at Lowe's, but it was cheaper."
1,A Horrible book that's well written,"The author is too self absorbed and never succeeds in his quest to find the ""true south"" because he can't see beyond his own limited view."
1,Save Your money Don't Buy This Junk!!!,"If you are thinking about buying A Sybex software product please read below.......Sybex Cert manual are very useful.... Don't assume the same of their software!!!! Sybex software is junk and useless!I had problems with the activation code as some of the people leaving comments here. SYBEX encodes all their product with a over protective licensing scheme, the first several pages of their manual are dedicated to talking about how to install and deinstall your one license.In order to use the software they require registration via web or phone. In my case, the registration number did not come in the factory sealed package and there was no customer support during the weekend. Then when I was able to contact Sybex, I was told they could do nothing for me.I will not longer buy any of their software products. And if you do not want to lose your money do the same."
2,Needing help with code/ poor sybex support,"I have purchased sybex products in the past and the products have been clearly written.With the learning materials again I am pleased except with the license problem with the lab. I have tried to install the license but keep getting error code messages. sybex support is poor.Can any one help with installing the license or give me an product id I am supposed to enter? I have tried the manaul install and it gives different user numbers also but still I am unable to install the license.I will prob. still buy sybex products in the future as they do have good technical products for certifications, but may open the box at purchase to double check for product id codes on the cd's.blong"
3,Pretty lifeless & disappointing,"I like live albums, and I also like Simon & Garfunkel. See my 5-star customer review of their CD ""Live from New York City, 1967"" if you doubt me. Their voices always meshed so perfectly, so it's sad that now their words are slurred and the harmonies sloppy. I guess age can fell even the greatest of us, but I'd rather not hear how badly it's affected S&G, especially Paul Simon. His diction is so poor on occasion that I wondered if he's suffered one or more minor strokes in recent times. There are occasional highlights on the album - Garfunkel's luminous but slightly faint vocals on ""Kathy's Song"" for one - but the negatives are more prevalent. Worst of all is how many of the songs have been slowed down to a deadly crawl. I'm actually sorry I bought this one, and that's after some fairly positive anticipation of its release."
3,Depends what you like..,"I am a massive paul and art fan and naturally i bought this. It has a phenonomal set list filled with a nightsworth of enjoyment. However, if you are not a fan of nostalgia this CD will traumatize you. I personally almost fel traumatized to see video and photos of them as young kids and then see them as very old men, men that voices have weakened and look like 2 very old men. On that note, the product is breath taking, and your heart will glow with grace for the duo, but if you ar a fan of simon and garfunkel's literall sound this cd is not for you. The sound quality in it's own is shot and as said before the voidces while still containing gifts have declined. If you are looking for extremely great sound and phenonomal performance thiks is not for you, if you want simon and garfunkel live today with some flaws buy this cd."
4,slow cd,if you like the fast song's then this is not the cd for you but if you want a slow and culm cd so this is the one for you
2,Not That Great,"Saw the concert live in Anaheim, CA and the CD did not live up to what I remember at all. It was disappointing. The DVD of the live performance, however, is great."
1,Total disappointment,"I too got this film to add to my growing collection of Alan Rickman films and was sadly disappointed. I found Mike Binder to be annoying and ridiculous beyond measure and the absolute implausibility of the storyline caused me to roll my eyes so many times I had a headache by the end of the movie! The whole nun thing was awful. And as has been said before in other reviews here, the likes of Janeane Garofalo and Juliet Stevenson are wasted.Oddly enough, despite my negative impression of the film as a whole, I have a great desire to see Alan Rickman do more comedy. I adore him in his dramatic roles but he has a gift for symphonic sarcasm that keeps me wanting more. Who knows, however, why he chose this project. I sincerely hope some smartly written comedies (let me stress this again, this was not smartly or even well written) come his way."
1,Not worth buying,"If you are considering adding this film to your Alan Rickman collection, don't bother. Rickman's performance is nice, but the film is so overwhelmingly dull that you will simply end up fast forwarding to the Rickman bits. I can't imagine who thought this script was worth making."
1,Uncaring seller,I have no way of knowing about this product.The seller did not ship nor return 3 E-Mails. Got a refund. Amazon should conduct an investigation of this seller based on the amount of negatives listed.
3,Nothing exciting from a usually exciting artist,"Pino Daniele has had a protean career, exploring different genres of music (pop, rock, world, jazz, funk) with great aplomb. No matter where you are on the globe, or your musical tastes, you are bound to find three titles from his catalog you adore and three you can't bear to listen to. Now exiting his Latin jazz phase, but not really doing much else in terms of originality or inspiration, he is more entrenched in the jazz/rock fusion style pioneered by Carlos Santana. If that's your cup of tea, this is for you. Still, Daniele is at his best what he is not so derivative and more original, and that can't be said for either of his last two albums."
5,Dolores or Madeline - the city pig,"This book brings reality to everyday life - I purchased the soft cover version at Heathrow Airport last Summer (2000) and it was titled Madeline - the City Pig. My 16 month old daugher enjoyed it soo much, the colors and illustrations amazed her as much as the story-line amazed me. The story-line became the topic of conversations at social gatherings and people who read this book to my daughter laughed at poor Madeline who had a work / life balance issue and had to get away from it all and move to the countryside. They too enjoyed it tremendously. Sadly we left the book on a plane over Thanksgiving -so I have spent 4 months looking for Madeline - the City Pig with no success. Now that I have stumbled upon the new title - I will be purchasing it straight away. A wonderful book and one that will be kept in the family heirloom for providing hours of entertainment to our family"
3,Not that great... :(,"I got this book from the library, because even though I'm homeschooled, I was hoping it might give me tips on studying for tests doing homework, and other such things. The only thing in there I didn't really know before was how to place things in your backpack to make it not so heavy. And their schedule for getting ready in the morning was not bad either. Also, the ""After School"" section, gave you pretty good advice on tryouts and how much is too much activities. But being as to how that's just about two thirds of the book I'd say it's not worth your money. Also they make middle school sound scarier than I think it really is. For example, they said ""Picture yourself having a good time in middle school."" They make it sound like you're going to a different country! So overall, you might get it at the library, but I wouldn't buy it."
5,Great for starting middle school and more!,"I was going to a new school for tenth grade and I just happened to love ""American Girl"" books. Anyway, even though it's supposed to be specifically for middle schoolers, it can also be for high schoolers starting out or anyone going to a new school. The information in here is helpful and very informative. The illustrations are great and the quizzes are very enjoyable. I reccomend this book for any girl between the ages of eleven and seventeen."
4,Very helpful book!,I am going into middle school this year and this book answered all my questions. I think anyone who is nervous about starting middle school should read this book.
2,Not that helpful,My eleven year old daughter and i read it. It was not that helpful. Everything in there she already knew. I recomend it if you were homeschooled but otherwise it's not that great.
5,great book for a nervous 5th grader,"My daughter's anxiety about middle school was increasing during fifth grade, so I got this book for her. She brought it to school, and when the weather was too cold to go out for recess, she read the book with a girl from her class who will be attending the same middle school. They are now best friends and can't wait for sixth grade."
3,"Eh, it was ok...","This book was ok, but I practically knew everything that they wrote about. THe only thing that was helpful was how to open a locker. Unless you've been homeschooled since kindergarten and are going to a school for the first time and have no idea about what to expect, don't buy this book."
4,Girls liked it,"Purchased this the summer before middle school started, after I realized she was having concerns but she didn't seem to want to talk about it. Her and her friends read this book over and over. I don't think there was anything particularly important in it, very vague... but it helped build her confidence, so I have to recommend it. This also led me to purchase American Girl's ""Care and Keeping of You"". Neither book has been mentioned out loud but I have noticed they get a lot of wear."
3,Nice coffee pot,"Nice coffee pot for the price. Aluminum is pretty thin and flimsy, but it will get the job done."
3,"Works, but poorly constructed",This coffee pot works o.k. but it is VERY poorly constucted. Be prepared to make some modifications to make it last.
1,Don't make things like they use to,This item is poorly made. The stem that holds the basket bends easily. Basket is loose fitting. Unsatisfactory workmanship. Waste of money.
4,Exactly what I was looking for!,"Every year I host a camping trip and I am the offical coffee maker in the morning. As my camping group grew larger, so did the need for a bigger coffee pot. This is perfect! It is nothing fancy, just a good ole' aluminum, perculating coffee pot. It is just a larger version of the one I've used for years! Love it and I know I'll be using it for a long time!"
1,Lousy Product,"I have used several aluminum coffee pots over the years and know they are not as sturdy as stainless steel. However the first time I used this pot, the handle on the body of the pot (the one you must have if you want to pour) pulled off it's rivets and rendered the pot useless. I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a dependable camping coffee pot"
2,"Worked Great on Days 1 and 2, inside snapped on Day3",This was awesome when camping with ~12 adults and worked like a dream (used coffee filters to keep grounds out of coffee).Unfortunately my internal percolator was made with very soft aluminum so it bent easily and cracked. this caused the water to not be able to go up the straw.
4,The many faces of Great Neck,"I loved browsing through the book and finding little gems and tidbits about Great Neck in the past that I didn't know about. The greatest fun is in the details, from Ann Hutchinson to Chrysler, to Eddie Cantor, we are presented with a panoply of actors and scenes that all add up to a fascinating history. The development of the various churches and synagogues, as different groups moved into the area, was especially interesting to me. And the photos are wonderful. As a long time resident, I have often flinched at the image many people have of my town as a place that represents the quintessential material culture at its worst. It is such a pleasure to have a book that shows how wrong those assumptions are, and that lays out the real diversity and excitement of this multi-cultural and multi-dimensional place. I wish everyone who ever made nasty comments about Great Neck would have a copy sent to him/her. The author and editor did a great job."
5,I FINALLY FOUND THE PRODUCT I USED WHEN I LIVED IN NYC! IT WORKS IT WORKS!,"HI I FINALLY FOUND THE PRODUCT I USED IN NYC, I BOUGHT THIS ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO ON THE TRAIN STATION FOR $3 AND IT HELPED MY HAIR VERY MUCH, ALSO HELPED MY HAIR GROW.........ITS NOT AS GREASY AND IT MADE MY HAIR GROW AND KEPT IT IN GOOO CONDITION, I NEVER REMEMBERED THE NAME OF IT, AND COULDNT BUY IT SINCE I MOVED TO NJ AND THEN FLORIDA, ANYWAY IF IT WASNT FOR A REVIEW THAT I READ THAT THESE WERE SOLD IN NYC I WOULDNT HAVE REMEBERED THIS WAS THE PRODUCT I LOVED SO MUCH! I REMEMBER IT COMING I A GREEN GLASS JAR BUT I COULDNT REMEBER NOTHING ELSE...THANKS TO THE REVIEWER THAT SAID THIS WAS SOLD IN NYC SINCE NOW I AM SURE THIS IS THE PRODUCT I USED!ANYWAY I FOUND IT ON EBAY AND THEY SELL IT SUPER CHEAP... AMAZON IS MUCH TO EXPENSIVE ..ONE SELLER ONE EBAY SELLS 24 JARS FOR $60 PLUS FREE SHIPPING! I AM BUYING THIS LOT, BUT LOOK OBN EBAY SINCE YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH FIND GOOD DEALS ON THIS PRODUCT."
5,Nature's Blessing in a Jar,"I bought this for the first time 2 years ago. It was intended for my son who was 2 years old at the time. A friend had recommended it to me because anything we had used up until this time wasn't penetrating his hair, scalp..etc. Well, he is 4 1/2 years old now and wears his hair in loc's and I'll just say we have never been without this product! It is great for the whole family and we all indulge in it! Truly a wonderful product for all hair types. They say it can be used on dry sin and chapped lips!"
2,Made with Petroleum,"This would be a great product. However, the mineral jelly it contains is made from petroleum and should not be used on hair. The smell is wonderful and were it not for that issue, I would definitely support this product. Unfortunately, many popular hair products are made with petroleum based products, which are not good for hair."
3,Okay,"I guess I was expecting something creamier, but this is nothing more than hair grease. Not what I was looking for."
2,Smells Nice,Aside from the pleasant smell and natural oils there was not much to like about how this product performed on my hair.If you lean towards the thick and wavy side Layrite Super Hold Pomade is what I found to be a better option.
5,Great!!,Nature's Blessing made a big difference in my daughter's hair. WEN by Chaz Dean and Nature's Blessing= perfect combination for my 8 yr olds dry hair.
1,Deceptive Product,The Nature Blessing Pomade ingredients list is very deceptive. The mineral jelly is actually petroleum jelly which is not a blessing to our natural hair at all. Petroleum jelly will leave your hair shiny but will suffocate your scalp in the process and cause build-up in any one's hair especially those who wear locs.
1,Mineral jelly is PETROLEUM,"This product claims to be made with good intentions, however listing petroleum as mineral jelly is an attempt to make a product which is harmful to the body--PETROLEUM--sound like something natural and ooh so good for you. If you are trying to stay away from petroleum based products, don't buy this."
5,smells great,I love this product it smells great on my skin and in my hair. Although I wish there were a plastic conainer for this product!
1,Bottle Of Grease!,"Had a package from UPS on my doorstep, boy was I excited till I opened it! The cap was off the jar and this stuff was everywhere, what a greasy oily mess! My boyfriend used it the next day and could not even get the grease off his hands with soap! A friend of his asked him if he used something different on his hair and said it looked greasy!!! This stuff is just pure olive oil. I can just use my own olive oil and get the same results thank you. Never again will I buy this product! Pomade, Yeah right!"
2,Smell too strong,Product does what it says it does but the smell is way too strong. It is not a bad smell but it's almost exactly the equivalent to walking around with a bottle of shampoo up to your nose all day long. You can imagine how that will make you sick.
1,Pass,I hate this product I didn't even put it in my natural hair. I hated the feel of it. It is NOT ANYTHING what natural haired ladies need in their hair.
5,You can't fool with Mother Nature!!!,"I stumbled upon this precious gem many years ago. I cut all of my hair along with the chemicals that I used to manage/treat it around 13 years ago and decided go natural. I read the ingredients and noticed, IT REALLY IS ALL NATURAL. I purchased two jars at the time.I began loc'ing my hair and used this to condition, moisturize as well as add sheen to my hair. This along with Dr. Bronner - Organic Castile Soap Peppermint, 32 fl oz liquidandDr. Bronner's Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, 18-in-1 Hemp Eucalyptus, 32-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)are the only products I use in my hair EVER!!!This is also great for moisturizing your skin, and the scent is so soft and sweet. Great for dry skin!This is an update, I am still a huge supporter of Nature's Blessings and have been using it now for 13 yrs. (5/7/09)"
2,Nature's blessings hair Pomade,This stuff was a little too greasy for my hair. I also didn't care for the scent. the scent was too strong and too masculine. I also didn't like that my jar didn't have the ingredients listed.For the record I have I have 4A-B hair.
3,Cute item ....with questions???,"What excatly are cats suppose to do with it and where do you insert the catnip? Our two cats were completely unthrilled with it and never bothered to check it out. We gave it to a friend who just bought a Ragdoll kitten, maybe he'll somehow enjoy it.It's a cute item but ...................??J Anthony"
1,If only they would be silent.,"Terrible, mawkish trash posing as a return to some sort of ""conservative"" aesthetic; in short, hallmark-card level tripe aimed at Generation X.Visit jollyroger.com, and you'll see that the only thing that matches McGucken's lack of talent is his bloated, gassy ego.-Autolycus"
5,What a beautiful book.,"This book reads like no other. So many sonnets telling the truths of life. Friendship, love, love lost, and everything else that goes along with life. I've read this book many times over, and I find soemthing new each time. Some of the sonnets are just so beautiful, they alone make up for the price of the book. At least, I think so."
5,The one to own,"This is a vhs of the ""Live from Lincoln Center"" presentation with Natalya Makarova and Ivan Nagy. It's the old David Blair production, and it's beautiful in it's simplicity. Nagy was Makarova's best partner, and her performance here is even more stunning & heartfelt than on the Royal Ballet tape with Dowell. Her adagio is unsurpassed to this day, and her portrayal of Odette as a woman trapped in the guise of a swan is so sad, it never fails to bring tears to my eyes. This has been out of print for eons, so grab it when used copies become available!"
3,Good Equipment DVD low quality,"The equipment itself is fine, but the DVD sound and image quality were poor, and the instructor was not the best in describing what she's about to do"
4,Great for different levels from beginner to advanced,"This is a great basic kit that gives you 3 tubes and a 30 minute video. The tubes range from light to heavy (even my kids can handle the light yellow tube). The workout is an overall workout for your entire body and does not focus on just one area. If you want to vary your workout by part of the body, you may want to buy this and then get another video that offers more specific exercises for those body parts. If you travel, this can easily be taken with you - just take the DVD and your main tube! Fun and effective - keeps my exercise routine varied and is great for the quick all over 30 minute workout!"
2,no good,The bands are not what I expected -quality wise. It will most likely snap after couple of use. The grip handles are not rubberized. A friend of mine has a set of SPRI which is of better quality -and I was hoping mine to be of the same... unfortunatey NOT. So Not happy with the product.
5,Spri tubing products are my favorite,I've been using Spri tubing products for about ten years. They are well made and last. I mostly use the medium resistance red tubing but do use the yellow and green for some exercises like for shoulders. The video is too basic for me but would work for a beginner. The kit is a good value and is probably geared for beginners-intermediate.
3,"Lots about her stuggles, few real facts","This is one mother's experience dealing with this newly recognized and often mislabled disorder. Her son's tribulations are heartbreaking to be sure and her advocacy for him is nothing short of heroic, however I was looking for more hard facts than she offers. If you need to commiserate, read this one."
4,Bridging the Gap: Raising a Child with Nonverbal Learning Disorder,"THis is an EXCELLENT book in content. It is written by a mother with a child with NVLD. It is not written with the school personnel in mind, but with the parents in mind and what the parents can do. She has very practical suggestions and gives examples of how these have worked with her child.However - the book binding itself is very poor. It is a Perigee book published by the Berkley Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Putnam, Inc. On my first reading 5 clumps of pages came out of the binding, all at various parts of the book and despite my intense TLC after the first clump fell out. I am very disappointed. This was purchased as a NEW book, not used."
4,WISH IT WAS OUT THEN,As a 24 year old person with nld i really loved this book i wish it had be written when i was in elementery school so i could so it to my teachers who did not understand me. i love how the author gives examples of her sons life. i also like the part htat compares nld to aspergers syndrome.
4,Great Youth Bow...One Flaw,"This is a great youth bow that even our teenagers enjoy. We easily would have given it 5 stars, however we had a problem in that the arrow ""holder"" broke off and we had to pull a spring-type from an old bow and improvise. Other than that a great bow for young archers."
4,Bear bow set,This bow is pretty good for beginners it's kinda small but shoots pretty good my only problem was that the a part where the wheel is broke but after i glued it back it worked good i would recommend this
3,"Bow is adequate, other stuff is junk","The bow itself seems well-made, although very very weak. With a full draw and shooting at a 45 degree angle, the arrow will go about 100 feet. If you limit yourself to 20-30 foot shots, it's OK.The included accessories, however, are total junk. Don't even bother putting on the quiver, it just gets in the way and the arrows fall out. The finger tab is adequate, I guess, but the wrist protector is incredibly cheap. There's no adjustment and the elastic broke within a few minutes.The arrows? Horrible.Overall, the bow was just barely good enough so that it was too much trouble to return the whole thing. If you get this kit, plan on spending another $30 or so on a wrist protector and some decent arrows.If I had it all to do over again, I'd go to some local sporting goods store and look into a nice little beginner's recurve bow instead of this compound one."
4,Making unrecognizable characters recognizable,"I was disappointed with the X-Men movies. Especially, with X3. One problem was how drastically different from the comics, the characters were. It also lacked the depth of character that I had so loved in the comics, years ago.Fortunately, two of the novelizations were written by Chris Claremont. He managed to infuse the characters with as much of their original personality (circa his original X-Men run) and history as he could. It just felt like coming home after a long, long time away. So, even though the characters were drastically different in the movie, they were recognizable in the book."
3,Any okay novelization,"The war between mutants and man is coming. Some are standing with Magneto including Jean Grey who is back from the dead. While other are with Professor X and the X-men. Caught in the middle of all this are a group men who have created a drug to destory the X-gene. Sides must be choosen. Heros will fall and not all will live the end of the last stand.Okay I have to confess that I had this book for about a year before I read and I only read it after I had saw the movie, a movie that I really didn't like. While the backgroud story into Jean's childhood was interesting, the book left with the same feelings that the movie did. It could have been so much more."
4,Super Reader,"This is really quite good, and Claremont throws in some things of interest.An extended danger room sequence, and Lockheed hovering in the shadows in Kitty's room. Green uniform mentions, and other little tidbits like President David Cockrum sketching when stressed.Lucas Bishop is a cop in District X, where one of the cure clinics is located.You get to see what many of the characters are thinking.Bobby melts down at the end of the fight, leaving him a little embarrassed.Beast is seen taking a class with Kitty in it.The end is different, as Magneto is working for Aletys Forrester on a fishing boat, until Moira MacTaggart approaches him, while playing chess with himself.Wolverine, at the end, is taking a danger room session of new students. Remy LeBeau, Danielle Moonstar, Sam Guthrie, and Sage.Definitely a cut above your average novelisation, and at 330+ pages has the room to be."
4,My thoughts,"All in all, a good rendition by Claremont to make a substandard movie better in novel form. It delved more into Jean's past as a child and the adult X-Men growing up in the school.The only thing lacking (okay, two things) from the movie to novel was the after the credit scene when Xavier spoke to Moira and (bless him) he wrote in that Rogue did not lose her power.Another thing that was off-comic storyline was Magneto ended up with Lee Forrester instead of Cyclops.Wrapping it up, I wish I would have just read the novel instead of seeing the film."
5,Glorious!,This is a wonderful collection of acappella music. The songs are very uplifting and some bring on the goosebumps! We enjoy this CD very much and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys gospel music.
5,Praise the lord!,"I love amazon.com because you can sample the music before you buy it. I definitely have to say that what I sampled on this album is exactly what I received in the mail. I recommend this album to all believers who love to worship the lord. Excellent is the only word that comes to mind when listening to this album, excellent worship to the lord."
5,Still an awesome game!,"I've purchased several copies of the game for my kids and now I have a server running Ubuntu linux and it runs natively just fine. Running version 8.04 of Ubuntu and happy I left Microsoft. The computer just runs and the games don't lag. I've noticed my latency has dropped by almost half since switching from XP.Anyway, the best part is the node capture mod. Very nice :DI'm hoping they come out with UT3 for Linux natively someday. Then I'll purchase a few copies of that. Thinking of Quake 4 since they have a native linux client out."
5,A fun game,A Much fun PC game. I remember playing the demo of this game and the full version doesn't dissapoint. The game never gets boring.
1,Useless piece of junk,"The cans that contain the bulbs don't have any way to be adjusted and just hang down. The company I bought it from was EXCELLENT with their quick customer service and refund, however."
1,Cheap & Defective,"Terrible product - cheaply made is one thing (the plastic hinges for the lights break easily), but what's worse is that 2 of the 3 the lights were installed backwards form the factory. They pointed up rather than down and they could not be reversed. I rate this product 1 star only because 0 stars was not an option. If I could rated this product 0 stars I would have."
4,Light Tree Floor Lamp,"Very easy to put together, aesthetically pleasing with its clean retro-modern style. (It arrived from the distributor with one of the light housings defective and the distributor sent out another one within one weeks and I was not required to ship the defective one back.) I'm very happy with it."
3,"A good addition to the Gamera collection, but it needs help","I've been working on my kaiju collection for some time now and have started rounding out the Gamera series. It's great that Shout Factory has brought these out for region 1 and most of the DVD's they have done have been of very good quality and used the production company originals for their DVD's (a caveat, the Daiei Motion Picture Studio did not have the budgets that Toho Studios did for the Godzilla movies...so there is some replication of scenes between the various Gamera movies; this is not something that Shout Factory did). Sadly, for this double feature ""Gamera: The Super Monster"" needed help with the dubbing; all of the sound is muffled for the English audio and quite distorted. I would recommend watching this movie using the Japanese audio with the English subtitles so you can enjoy the full sound quality."
5,Best quality Gamera films !,"Finally someone has taken the time to re-release all the Gamera films restored from the original prints. These are not the same grainy prints that Alpha video has been selling for years. These are crystal clear in widescreen...although it doesn't make the movie any less terrible. But if your a fan of the G-man, giant monster movies, or if you like to torture your own children by exposing them to the same horrible sci-fi crap that you were raised on - this movie is for you !"
4,Showa Gamera Now Complete.,I enjoyed these amusing kaiju movies for all the effort and small amounts of production financing that went into them. Supermonster somehow got a headlock on my heart and has never let go. Of course all of the monster battles are from the earlier Gamera movies but the earnest efforts by the actors won we over. Of special note is the lead heroic Spacewoman played by former Japanese women's wrestling champion Maach Fumiake. Ms Fumiake also had a career as a pop singer and sings the opening credits song. She also had supporting roles in the popular Taxing Woman and Taxing Woman 2 movies. Its just fun to watch old shellback knock the stuffing out of all his weird foes. Just watch out for the evil Imperial Battle Cruiser.
1,Something went wrong,"I just want to mention that something went wrong technically with the transfer for this dvd as Zigra has extreme aliasing. It looks like any edge has some kind of extreme blocking with blurry interiors taking away clarity. Something was done wrong and it is painful to watch. I haven't watched Super Monster yet but I read that it happens there too along with muffled English audio.Also on the menu design for this disc you can't select languages or subtitles but instead have to use the audio or subtitle button on the remote.On the other Gamera dvds from SF, you can't change audio or subtitle mid film. The other Gamera dvds have great transfers though. Also the layer break is mid film on Gamera vs Guiron and Gamera the Giant monster causing a pause and this wasn't necessary considering the data could have fit on one layer."
4,Klassic Kaiju film!,Something to complete my Monster collection.Nippons 2nd most popular Kaiju of all time..I am happy with the product aswell.
5,Well Worth It,"I have used backpack sprayers before, but spent a lot of time manually pumping to keep up the pressure. This sprayer eliminates the pumping and works like a charm. I recommend it for anyone who has lots of spraying to do."
4,shurflos great,"I just recently purchased this pack sprayer. Works great. I use it every day, sometimes 5 to 6 times a day, which brings up a couple of questions. Why doesnt it have a handle? Needs handle to be easily picked up. I usually have to pick it up by the shoulder straps which can be a pain if you dont grab a hold correctly. Also, it needs a holder to clip on the sprayer wand. Other back pack sprayers provide a c-clip or holster for the wand to prevent breakage and to make it more compact for storage. Also, it needs a variable pressure knob in order to adjust the pressure of spray. Other than that, I am very happy with my purchase. Sure beats the pumping of the lower cost units."
1,An absolute piece of junk,"Had it for a couple of years. Pump failed twice, charging circuit failed several times, battery died several times, and finally the gun/wand/trigger died over and over again. The tank is the only thing that hasn't failed yet. Customer service is nice and folksy but the thing keeps dying. A total waste of money"
4,it really works!!!!,I used and worked u need to mix it with water first. U can use it couple of times.Great price
1,Chemical Sunscreen,"For those of you looking for a physical sunscreen, this is not it. Here are the ingredients, which should be listed here (in order of appearance). Many of them rate highly on the toxicity index.active:octinoxate, octocrylene, octisalate, oxybenzone, zinc oxideinactive:deionized water, propylene glycol, cetearyl & stearyl alcohol, sorbitan stearate & sucrose cocoate, acrylates copolymer, dimethicone & c12-15, alkyl bezoate, xanthan gum, methyl paraben, propyl parabeb, diazolydinyl urea"
2,secret ingridients?,The amount of zinc oxide directly relates to the products effectiveness. 5% is minimum....This product does NOT tell you how much is in it......Won't order it again.
5,Wow,"I can't be in the sun, as I will break out! This is the only thing that I have found that stay's on all day and protects my face 100%.. Will always buy this product!!!"
4,Great but overpriced,This stuff is great for your face but the Walmart in my area carries it for $1.50 each. Doesn't make you look white like other zinc oxide products.
3,"Good Protection, Bad Fragrance",I was disappointed to find there was fragrance in this and also chemical sunscreen- I was looking for a solid physical block for sensitive skin.
2,No different than regular sunscreen--waste of $$!,"For the amount you get, this stuff is very overpriced. There is also a false bottom to the container to give you the illusion that you're getting more for your money.I bought this hoping it would work like ""traditional"" zinc oxide that doesn't rub off easily and blocks almost all of the sun (it was also the only zinc oxide product available at the store where I was). I found that it's basically regular sunscreen: no better, no worse, but much more expensive."
1,Caused swelling,My wife used this product several times over the summer and always had swelling of her lips after use. We thought it was something else but the swelling came back every time she used the product. She stopped and the problem went away. She tried it one more time to be sure and the swelling came back. Be careful if you have sensitive skin.
5,love this,always use ocean potion products..they are great and water proof ...leave it on your skin for 20 minutes before going in water or sun :o)
5,Loved it!,"This is the first book I have read of this authors'. I loved it. It was rich in details, with well developed characters. Good story line and steamy love scenes. If you want real romance and sexy men this is it! Can't wait til I read her other books!"
3,Good beginning...boring middle...nice ending,This book had lots of promise and an entertaining beginning. The sea passage to America and their subsequent visit to the 'landing' in Virginia was B-O-R-I-N-G! It got good again when the traveled to Philidelphia and Hilary entered the picture. Ending had some good plot turns and unexpected twists. Overall: slightly above average.
3,Mulan Tai Chi DVD Thoughts,"The DVD, in general, is good, though I had issues with some aspects. The instruction is good for experienced Tai Chi practitioners, but not for the beginners. Angela didn't provide the names of the movements, and some of the movements were mixed. She presented some movements in the instruction and others in the routine. In addition, the movie was filmed in the corner of a room, which confuses the angles of the turns."
4,If you are in the Death Care Industry.....,"This book is pretty funny, but when I read parts I thought were particularly funny to non Death Care folks..well they just didn't see how it was humorous..."
1,"clever idea, execution leaves something to be desired -","It is the job of a book with 'Humor' in its title to be funny. ""Underground Humor"" misses the mark, and by a considerable amount at that. I come, as you can see, to bury ""Underground Humor"", not to praise it."
1,ZZZZZZZZ........,"This book was very boring. I actually fell asleep while reading it. Most of the Epitaphs were from London, and they wern't even ""Hilarious"" as the title says. Most of the quotes were just plain dumb. I returned the book."
1,Doesn't work,"This is the third Genie replacement remote purchased in the past 2-3 years. The others lasted about a year each(compared to 14 years for the original remote)which was very disappointing. However, this one simply does not work at all. Nothing more to be said about it."
4,Don't be fooled.,"Genie Intellicode Gitr-3 Remote Replaces Git-1, Git-2 & Git-3Not what is in the picture.I was still able to program for my door anyways.i gave it 4 beacause it worked and programmed very easily and it also arrived very quickly.Hey for 20 bucks not bad but not like the picture.Then link is whar the one you get is like but it still works."
3,Not the one in the picture,"The remote is a Genie and it works, but it's NOT the one in the picture. I ordered it because it was identical to our old one, but the one that was shipped is rectangular with 3 buttons."
1,Genie leave a bit to be desired,"described EXACTLY as the old unit I have (damaged so need a new one). BUT I wonder WHY they have changed to a CR2032 'flat' battery ... makes even less sense since the A23 identified in the instructions is a 12V battery while the CR2032 is only 3V > They had to have changed the electronics ... and 3V just WILL NOT CUT IT as a transmitter, PLUS the battery will die a lot faster. Saving Grace: At least they inserted a little slip of paper noting that the CR2032 is now being used. In any case the first unit I received DOES NOT work (would not program) ... I checked and found DEAD CR2032; now awaiting replacement."
2,Poor Quality,"Don't know what's up with Genie, but she must be stuck in the bottle! Every 1 - 2 weeks I have to reprogram all three of my buttons, and half of the time, they won't even program. Called customer service and was told it must be all three of my door openers causing the problem, which all have a lifetime warranties, but Genie won't do anything about it. Buy a Craftsman or some other brand...Genie is out to lunch."
1,Doesn't work all Models,Can't be programmer to my 10-year old door opener model. Apparently all Intellicode remotes/openers are not compatible. Infomation available during order process doesn't make this clear. Researched manufacturer's website but still no clarity. Disappointed. Guess I'll be returning this product.
3,functional,this product works fine. the only beef i have with it is that it uses one of those not very popular flat lithium batteries.
3,Extremely Lacking - dont pay $25 for it,"Let me start with saying that I LOVE CHUCK PALAHNIUK, and being the kind of person who hunts down videos of every appearence he can find - im still glad that i have this dvd. BUT, its the kinda thing that you dont want to pay blu-ray prices (and in most cases MORE than blu-ray) to have. Because their simply is just not enough in it.And by the way it lies, this DOES NOT include the reading of the guts storyThe real docu is only an hour and thirty minutes and a suprising amount doesnt have chuck even in it.And there is very little in the second disc - they could have easily just made it one disk.Bottomline this is the kind of thing you just watch on the internet for free - and if you get the chance to watch it than do so but DONT pay full price - dont pay anything over seven dollard"
2,Not what I was hoping for,"This was actually rather disappointing. If you have to own everything that chuck has out there then you will want this, but otherwise you're really not missing much.Most of the DVD is about the college were they had chuck up for a weekend. Most of the video was awkward interviews with people I really cared nothing about, and there was really only a sprinkling of some cool speaking from Chuck.The other thing was that they advertised video footage of one of the readings were people passed out from hearing the graphic story. This was also a bust, and the video footage they had was incomplete.I have to admit, I wouldn't buy it again. And definitely not for full price."
3,Nice enough read-not great,A little too old fashioned for this old cowboy. Good story but a bit hard to follow in places. Not bad
4,Delve into the creative process of a famous designer,"I recommend this as a must have for anyone interested in couture. It is a very detailed and revealing book on the working methods of Christian Lacroix. No other book follows the mind of a famous designer as he creates a collection the way this book does. It draws on Christian's very own notes and scrapbook. Great content, great visuals, great book!"
2,Don't buy this.,"These are not skin tight. They add almost 1/2 an inch to the size of the iPod in all directions. They do not protect the screen. They are too grippy, so if you pull it out of your pocket, your keys, papers, and everything else comes with it. The only color that looks any good is the color that matches your iPod. It's not worth $20. Only buy these if you have a bad habbit of dropping you iPod mini on hard floors, otherwise, don't!"
2,No Screen Protection,"First off, the picture on Amazon doesn't match the actual colors you will get! So be careful. You DO NOT get the green colored skin that is in the picture. Also, you cannot have the skin on and be able to use you ipod belt clip. How stupid is it have a strap that attaches to the skin? Am I going to hang my ipod around my neck??? Not all of us ipod users are teenagers in highschool.The skin does not have a screen protector either. Great! So now, all I have is an ipod with a skin, in the wrong color, that is now too bulky, cannot be attached to my jeans or running shorts ( but I can wear it around my neck!!!) , and will still have a screen that gets scratched.Don't buy it. Try something else."
5,Score!,"I bought this to go on the back end of my car, although as I recall it's advertised for the back of a truck. My 2012 Prius has a back end that's just painted metal, with no real bumper that was scratched within a week of my getting the car. Knowing my parallel parking skills, I decided I needed something to protect myself and whomever might be behind me so I got this. It went on easily, has stayed put, and works great for what I intended. It also looks fine; even adds a little textured interest to the back of my car, which I could say didn't have any before."
3,It's not as bad as it might seem,"B.B. King's music always inspires an emotional reaction in the listener and this album is no different. However that reaction at first probably is along the lines of: ""What the hell is this?"" and ""Where is his unmistakable guitar sound?"" But when you get past that (and learn to skip a few of the tracks... kind of like Clapton's ""Pilgrim"" album) there is enough to catch and keep your attention."
3,"OK for wheels, poor for seat","This is a very cleverly produced lock in which three pins in the key fit into downward tapered groves in the lock, and I am very pleased to have this lock on the wheels on my bike. The directions, however, caution the user to be very careful not to over tighten the lock - and for good reason!! While a snug fit works well with the wheel skewers, a much tighter fit is needed with the seat so that it doesn't slide down. I kept tightening and trying the lock on the seat until it no longer fell down when riding. Unfortunately, this degree of tightness prevented it from being loosened for an additional adjustment. I had to grind the lock off to get it loose. So...., a good product, but not when used where a tight fit is needed. A better bet would be the two piece wheel set, also sold by OnGuard (OnGuard Wheel & Seat Locks 2 piece set Front & Rear Wheel QR Locks)."
4,Decent security measure.,"These have worked so far to keep my front and back wheels secure, as well as seatpost. I give 4 stars instead of 5 only because I bought three sets of these for three different bikes, and one key opened two sets of the three. A friend of mine purchased another two (on my suggestion) and one of his keys opens my third set.So, though I feel far more secure than having quick-lock skewers, I don't feel like these are perfect. I still lock the back wheel through my Kryptonite U-lock, because why not? But I think it's at least slightly less necessary than it used to be.NOTE: some posts can't accommodate the seatpost lock. Look at the shape of the inside. The curves are different on some seatposts."
2,vintage bike? buyer beware!,"these skewers are a good concept and work great on the front wheel. HOWEVER, if you have horizontal dropouts in your bike (seen in vintage imported road bikes) you probably WILL NOT be ABLE to get the rear skewer to work and your wheel will fall off. not only does this suck, b/c you'll be out your money, but also its a road hazard. OnGuard REALLY NEEDS to put some warning on the packaging about this issue. and yes, I installed them correctly (as did the 3 other mechanics who tried)."
4,a nice evening out,Very nice concert DVD for the home system. The percussionist made some great sounds too. Would of liked to be there.....
5,Disco at its best,This is a must have for all Disco fans. The CD has a wide range of classic disco songs that are tough to find separately. If you like the songs of the 70's you should give this a look.
3,Color fail. Excellent texture.,"Think of this as colored lip balm. Feels great, applies smoothly, doesn't flake or dry out. It also doesn't show up: the color is extremely sheer."
3,title...,"ok.. this band is by far one of the best bands playing now.... comparable to the mars volta, tool and radiohead in concept and scope. however, this single leaves a little to be desired. heaven alive is the radio edit version and i'm not one for the radio... this only means the song has been shortened to fit in a standard time slot allotted for a radio song, but oceansize isn't a band that should be compressed and shortened to fit on the radio... the other song, i/b/o/w is a nice instrumental, but with that being said, i feel in order to give fans something worthwhile, an instrumental should be followed up by a b-side from the record. just giving us a b-side instrumental seems a little weak... the song is great, don't get me wrong. i just feel for $11.99 you should get at least 2 unreleased songs... . .but, be sure to check out their first full length effloresce, music for nurses ep, and the full length this single was taken from, everyone into position...."
5,Refutes Dominant Myths about Zoning and Land Markets,"This is an excellent, comprehensive refutation of the idea that the land use we have is a result of free-market choices. The author covers theory, law, and empirical evidence to prove this point that there are societal costs when we exclude people out from where they would like to live. A little bit of background in economics would prove helpful, but the author does such a good job explaining concepts that it is not necessary. It is especially important today because it forcefully counters the dominant narrative in planning and economics."
3,Picture does not match what I received.,"The picture shows the shell being fastened with screws and nuts. It also shows a metal stress relief where the cable comes in. The ones I received however have neither of these options. The hood simply snaps together with plastic ""legs"". These are horrible if you need to open or close the hood since they may break off.It also did not come with the metal stress relief. Instead, it is just some plastic collar that snaps into place.In this case, it will probably work for this project. But I wanted to give a heads up to anyone else looking. I have also posted pictures of what I received."
3,Definite Learning Toy,"I used this toy for adult classrooom training for:1) Team building - I split the classroom into small teams that construct the model in order to demonstrate team work principles.2) Standard Work Instructions - The instructions that come with this model as minimal. Teams develop the work instructions for how the model should be assembled. We review the instructions and critiques whether or not the teams have captured all of the main steps, key points and the ""knack"" for assembling the model via testing out the work instructions.However, the models did not seem very durable once constructed."
3,"Didn't *Grab* Us - a review of ""Daddy Is a Doodlebug""","Just to let you know that *everyone* is not on-board with `loving' this book. My children (boy and girl) and my husband and I give ""Daddy Is a Doodlebug"" only three stars, meaning that we found it cute but nothing special.My children like looking at these 'buggy' drawings --the six-legged poodlebug and the carriage being drawn by a horse fly are cute-- but they don't care one wit about the text and story. (Go figure.)Three Stars. Cute artwork. Darn hard read-aloud. My children were not captivated. Find an example of rhyme and text below so you can try to figure out if your children will like it or not.We both eat potoodle chipsWhile walking through the zoo.`Cause Daddy is foodlebug,And I'm a foodlebug too."
4,Cute!,"We bought this book for my husband to read to the kids and they all get such a kick out of the silly rhymes! It is a bit confusing to read the first few times, but we eventually got the hang of the ""doodle-words!"" We also have Degen's book, ""Jamberry,"" which we simply adore! The illustrations for both books are colorful and imaginative!"
2,Don't Hold 'Em!,"I bought this game because I'm a Yahtzee fan and also enjoy Hold 'Em Poker. It was a huge mistake to combine these two games. It was boring to play, unlike poker or regular Yahtzee. I agree that it was created to capitalize on the fame of Hold 'Em poker, but it was unnecessary. I'd rather play poker than this game. We played it once and now it's collecting dust on a shelf somewhere. A huge disappointment."
4,Yahtzee Texas Hold' Em,"Fun twist on two great games. If you like playing cards for fun, and you like yahtzee, this is a good game for you. It allows each player to have their own yahtzee cup and dice, it includes betting chips to keep the game interesting, and it brings fun to the table. The downside is, its not really a good game unless you have more than two people playing."
1,Can I get that 45 minutes back?,"Wow! This game is extremely boring. It also doesn't really make sense. Yahtzee is yahtzee and poker is poker. I don't think they were meant to co-exist. I really don't recommend this game unless you are 1) getting it as a novelty gift for someone who loves Texas Hold'em and you don't know what else to get them... 2)getting it for someone who collects all of the different Yahtzee games... or 3)getting it for someone who you really don't like that much. Really, can I get my 45 minutes back??"
1,Yahtzee Hold 'Em: A Bust!,"This game; is a poor attempt to capitalize on both the Hold'Em craze, as well as the Yahtzee franchise.If someone wants to play poker; they'll use playing cards; not dice. Besides; the original ""Yahtzee!"" game already rolls for full houses, straights, etc., the game is far from a unique concept.The only redeeming factor is the parts seemingly will hold up--for the few times you play this game."
4,Interesting,"This book explains how to focus on literacy skills within content areas. Great for secondary level teachers, especially those who teach outside of English."
5,Hilarious!,"If you want to laugh, this is one of the best collection of comedy. There are so many different characters, you can't go wrong."
4,ML-First Amendment :Season 2,"Martin Lawrence is an original in the world of comedy, he is completely different then most of his predeccessor in the very good way's. Season 2 of First Amendment is very good and has the same appeal as season 1."
5,worked perfect,arrived quickly and in good condition. I followed the baking instructions included with the pans and they worked great. I also used Wilton cake release and they came out perfectly shaped. Love Wilton.
1,Shoddy Product,I'm not happy with these cake pans. I used and washed them one time and they are now discolored and rusty. I cannot use these again. A waste of money.
1,Pans arrived badly scratched...twice,"I can't really speak to how these pans work for cakes, because I had to return two sets within one week. Each arrived with bad scratches. They are nested inside each other for delivery, and even though there is tape and a cardboard piece to hold them still, it doesn't work - each pan gets completely scratched by the one above it. This could be solved easily by a layer of tissue paper between each pan. I'm very frustrated at having to go through the return process twice for the same item. And now I have to go find them in an actual store so that I can inspect them before purchasing."
3,pan size,"i really needed 3"" deep pans and you send me only 2"" deep pans i however had them shipped to a different address suppose to be used for my brothers wedding and now were stuck with 2"" deep pans :-/"
5,Great pans,Yhese are great pans. Great quality and they are nonstick which I love. You can't beat the price for the quality you get.
3,So so aluminum quality,"This is my first Wilton product, and I'm not impressed. It's because I also boughtNordic Ware 4 Piece Bakers Half and Quarter Sheet Combo Pack with Lidsin the same order. The aluminum grade/quality difference between the two is day and night. The Wilton's aluminum seems to be a lower grade than the Nordic Ware's, because they are all scratched up by stacking one on top of another. These pans also have rainbow color on the surface; which normally only occurred on consumer grade stainless steel cookware with high heat. I've never seen the rainbow color on aluminum cookware before.In any case, I'm sure these will work just fine. But I'll buy Nordic Ware stuff from now on, even though they are a little more expansive. But I think Nordic Ware stuff will last a lot longer, plus they are made in USA vs these pans are made in China."
4,Good for the price. Perfect for my project.,"As other reviewers have stated, the pans did have some scratches on them. One of the pans in my set also had a small dent in it, but didn't think it was bad enough to affect a cake.I didn't buy these pants to bake a cake. I actually bought them to make a diaper cake for a shower. It's perfect to make a large 4-tier diaper cake. I used size 2 diapers. It takes about 80 diapers to make a cake."
5,If Your Little One Loves Pokemon....,"This is a great game on rainy days! Once you get started, the little ones' imaginations take flight and they're Pokemon Trainers. It's fun to watch, and to participate even if your goal in life is NOT to catch or battle for Pokemon!"
5,Super Fun Game!!!,"My 7 yr. old son absolutely loves pokemon cards and ""battling"" with them. I really don't enjoy playing the card game with him, so I purchased this game for him for Christmas hoping it would be something I'd enjoy playing with him. We played it yesterday for the first time and I LOVE IT!!!! We had to play with the directions out next to us for the first few moves. But, we all caught on quickly and had lots of laughs. It also moves quickly....which is nice for a family with 3 young children. I/We look forward to playing the game again and highly recommend it for any family with pokemon crazed kids! Enjoy!!!"
3,It's alright.,"This is an overall fair game. My daughter is 4 years old, and she loves the game. She always is getting me to play it with her. It is a little simple, more suited to people around 5 years of age with a little help from parents. My daughter reads, and knows math so it's not too hard for her."
1,ok but could do better,"This game is fun, but I'd make a few changes. Like making the Pokemon out of cards. I'd prefer chips, because they are easier to handle and keep track of. But overall I'd say this game is pretty fun, and is a good thing to add to your collection."
2,Not Quite as Described,"A mix of historical footage, interviews, and narration. I say it is not quite as described because almost 30 minutes of the 51 minutes running time describes the situation of the Jews in Nazi Germany prior to the conference, leaving only 20 minutes for the conference itself. I think anyone who would buy this video knows most of this information, and wants information about the conference and what happened there. There was very little in the way of details in that regard. The production values were also slightly below average, with the audio of the narrator's voice being drowned out by the music. It was also made before the Wannsee villa became a museum and learning center, so it is a little dated in that regard. Production date: 1992."
2,Not What I Expected,"Like most others commenting here, I thought this was the 1984 German film of the actual conference. It isn't. It's a very general documentary about the Jewish situation in Europe during the time leading up to the conference and while I enjoy a good documentary, this one is too general for my tastes. I have virtually all of the information here in other formats, making this redundant. Pity."
3,The Conference,"For those who have not read 'Rise and Fall of the Third Reich', this film offers some insights into the establishment of 'The Final Solution'. It should be a precursor to The Holocaust series of dvd's offered by Amazon.Though some of the statements made seem self-servient, they expose the roots of the most hellish treatment ever to visit a race of peoples."
5,Classy Picks!!,"I got them since I thought they look different. We dont drink Martini but I still thought there would be some use for these lovely picks. These are exactly the same way they look or even better I would say.They come in a classy black pack(can be preserved to keep the picks in place). They come in the perfect size and thickness. The designs are also lovely. My only concern is they are too sharp. It might not be safe to keep it when kids are around or even with drunk adults I would say. The material is pewter and is very similar to steel, so I am kind of hesitant to use it in a glass.I plan to use them as starter picks rather!! Because there are extremely classy looking picks. Just make sure you use and keep them keep since they are kind of sharp!!"
2,Detached,"Just a simple but annoying problem, one of the pick tops slid off into my hands when I opended the package. Not a big deal, but QC should be a bit better."
5,"Great for martinis, but a little too, well, silver and shiny, for tiki drinks","Very classy, heavy, solid martini picks. Folks will be able to find their own drinks at your party as well.Not anywhere near kitschy enough for a good tiki drink though. Could you imagine a silver (well, pewter) pick skewering a maraschino cherry and a slice of orange hanging over the lip of a tall glass of red rum goodness? It would be wrong."
5,another well made Corduroy story,"It is definitely another well made Corduroy story. Our five year old daughter loves the stories, and it is also a nice family time to watch it all together."
2,SOS,"Yada, yada, yada. Its same old stuff that is just rehashed that every trader has ever read about. If you've never read a book on TA, then it's an OK read. If you've already read about TA whether in futures or stocks, read a classic instead."
5,ask a question,"I'm very happy finding so much reveiw about this book. now ,future marketingng is growing fastly in my country .But here, so little book introduct about it.can i buy this book,through Amazon?Now ,i am in china!"
4,I love this lamp!,"I love this thing so much that I had it repaired instead of purchasing a new one when I had an issue with it. The switch would get really hot and it ended up melting. It was half of the price to repair it so I went that route. I purchased this lamp because I wanted a highly-adjustable light source that was higher than the height of my computer monitor. The height allows me to use it without the glare on my computer monitor. I think I used it for about a year, year and a half before the switch melted. I would totally recommend this with the caveat that the switch may be an issue down the road. That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
1,"A Question, Not a Reflection of Solzhenitsyn's Work!","The ONE STAR RATING is, of course, NOT about Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago!The one star rating is to note that Amazon has the volumes out of order.The text on this page refers to GULAG ARCHIPELAGO, VOLUME ONE, AN EXPERIMENT IN LITERARY INVESTIGATION.The picture on this page, however, shows GULAG ARCHIPELAGO, VOLUME THREE, KATORGA, EXILE, AND STALIN IS NO MORE.This confusing situation can cause the Amazon.com customer to buy the wrong book. I hope Amazon.com fixes this error. Thank you!"
5,This zany ride to the gulag will leave you in stitches!!!!!,"This kooky off the wall comedy about Solzhenitsyn's journey to and ultimately through the Gulag system is a must for all you ""Schindler's List"" and ""Hogan's Heroes"" fans out there.His hilarious descriptions of NKVD torture techniques will touch your funny bone and his moving stories of people confessing to crimes they didn't commit and implicating innocent acquaintances so that their daughters don't get raped and murdered will touch your heart. This story really touched me a lot. While it does tend to brood on some of the more negative aspects of Soviet society anyone with an open mind and a sense of humor should be able to appreciate this ligh-hearted romp through the pogroms.A must read for anyone who has ever cried or laughed."
5,the best book i've ever read,this explained to me triumph and tradgedy in it's rarest form. solzhenitsyn is a brilliant novelist. the best best book ever. the gulag is a novel that everyone should read. history wouldn't be the same without it. solzhenitsyn's masterpeice. this reader loved it.
3,Carlos Venezuela,I prefer the normal Cranium as in this game you don't play in teams...thus for adults unless you've had a few drinks it can get kind of slow.
1,disappointed,I bought this item for use with my iphone but it does not fit so I am very disappointed
2,Volume Slider is Useless,"Beyond being a useful splitter so two people can listen to same source of audio it's not living up to expectations. The volume slider just doesn't do anything, ran tests with 4 pairs of earbuds and external speakers and sound level did not move a bit on sliding the slider. If you want a simple splitter (I did, thought I would get a value add which I didn't) go for it as it is well constructed; just have no expectations on controlling volume individually on each split connection."
1,This was a terrible product,"I thought my girlfriend and I could use this on vacation to watch the same movies on the iPad but the sound was not distributed to both headphones. In fact, the quality was diminished even though it was only coming through one set of headphones. Overall, I think this is a great concept but some refinement is obviously in order."
1,Worthless Volume Control,"This thing is effectively just a splitter. The ""volume control"" adjusts the volume so slightly we had to play a solid tone just to notice the change. Don't buy this if the ""individual volume control"" is part of your requirements.On the good side it arrived rather quickly."
5,Great for 2 people to use at same time,"Bought this for travel so my husband and I can listen to movies in the airport. Easy to use, individual control - which is a must. Quick delivery."
2,Fell apart,"It worked great, but then I started to notice it would cut in and out so we had to have it held in a certain position. THEN the 3.5mm plug BROKE OFF! I used it a few more times by shoving it back in and bending it around while in my laptop. It's sad cuz I liked it..."
1,Griffin Smart Share Crappy Headphone Splitter.,I've had 2 of these splitters sent to me. The first pair had a defective left side that didn't work right of the package. The second package had a sound dimmer switch that is also defective. I just think that it's a simple idea and design with poor workman ship and design. Not worth the trouble purchasing this piece of crap.
3,Griffin Headphone Splitter,"This item does the job it's supposed to do. The individual volume controls sounded as if they'd be handy but are sort of difficult to adjust - it's best to have the volume up all the way on the laptop, ipod, etc then each person can use their own volume adjustor to more accurately find a comfortable listening volume."
2,Splitter works but volume control is quite frankly pathetic,"The splitter is working great, no issue there. But the individual volume controls - the difference between the max and min settings is a joke. I was expecting it to go from loud to near muted, but instead it is always loud to ever so slighty less louder. I have a separate headphone set with its own similar sized volume slider on it and it is infinitely better. I was hoping this unit would be useful for my wife and I as we travel, so she doesn't have to listen to my Blur music, or I to her classic piano concertos when we share the iPod.But what can you expect for $2...and this is a discontinued item by Griffin as it has been superceded by a newer version. Maybe they fixed it with that one."
4,works well,"I purchased this for my Nexus 7 and it works well - both my husband and I can listen without bugging others, and we can control our own volume level which is a plus."
2,"Good concept, but weak connector.","The dual volume controls are a great idea. I love ear cover headphones, the wife likes ear-buds and the mismatched types meant volume levels were never right. This little cable solves the issue when two folks are sharing media. The issue I have is the input plug is not designed for even the lightest of tugging of the cable. The entire plug seems to start coming apart after just a bit of use.. If the input is redesigned, this would be a great device."
3,Just okay,These work but don't do much as far as the volume goes. There are basically two setting on the volume control: loud and barely audible. There's really no middle ground between the two. If these had cost like $8 I would say they were worth it due to their low quality.
1,A costly headphone splitter,"Pay heed to the review below titled ""Volume control is practically meaningless"".I had wanted to split my PC speakers and a pair of headphones out of aSoundBlaster card without having to swap the plugs.By the description of the product, I would have thought that ""Individual Volume Control"" meant from 0 to 100 (with 0 being completly off). The controls here are more like 90 to 100."
5,Use it quite often,I listen to personal development & meditation cd's with someone who is hearing impaired. This device makes it possible for both of us to share the experience together at a comfortable volume for each of us.
5,Good product,"I don't know what Baltimore MW's problem is with this product. It met my expectations. It lets me plug two sets of ear plugs into my ipod. It is not too bulky, the volume control is a very nice feature, and I have not found it slide out of the plug. My wife and I plan to take it on a long plane ride and I believe it will let us listen to music in peace while letting me not have to listen to music at her volume (and she won't have to listen at my volume)."
3,"Saint Joseph, MI","The splitter was helpful because it also doubled up as volume control for the individual connections. However, the volume control button is not very effective as it provides only a small range of control. Sometimes, you end up using the control on the audio device itself."
3,Not that great...,"Prom Date wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It's kind of dumb and pointless, and it drags big time. I'm disappointed in this book, because there's only one more until the whole Seniors series is over, Gradution Day. With so many seniors left, we already know that lots of people will survive. Read this book, but don't hold your breath."
3,Seniors: Episonde 11: Prom Date,"Okay, truly I have no idea what the rest of you read in your books, because in my book Jennifer gets a charm from Trisha and wishes a guy for the prom to go with, and he comes alive. His name is Duke, and Trisha goes to the prom with Gary, since her parents are in Europe at the time. Back to the review... i personally feel this book was okay, it is not the best book I have ever read, but hey its coOl. I enjoyed the way R.L Stine keeps the reader in suspense through out the whole book about Duke and who he really is, but I wish they had not made him the bad guy, it would have been coOler if Duke was just left the way he was, but then again if he had not turned bad, there would have been no action in the story. I recomend only people who have read all the other Senior Series books to read this book."
5,A wish,"Jennifer Fear has just one wish. She wants a date for the prom. Then she meets Duke. He's handsome, cute and really hot! Totally perfect! But Duke isn't as perfect as Jen thinks..."
5,Deadly night,"Trisha Conrad has to date Matty Winger to the prom because her dad and Matty's dad are business partners. She embarasses Matty at th prom and later, starts to get threatening notes."
3,I'm a little confused,"Hello all, Umm... I'm not sure what book you guys are talking about but it's not the one i read. Mine was about jennifer making a bad wish. Oh well. To those of you that haven't read the book, i won't say that the above stuff about Matty getting it and Mary doing it does not happen. You'll just have to read the book to find out. I also didn't feel like this was Stine's best work. Not a lot happened(until the end) but even when something did happen it was kind of rushed. Anyways, it's a good read to keep up with the series, and maybe catch a death or two. ;) So i would still say read this, just don't be expecting much."
2,not a good book,the only reason it got two stars and not one is cuz it had one good part. the book was pretty lame and doesnt compare to the others. the whole book was pretty predictable. id only recommend it if you are reading the series.
1,The book is bad.,Prom Date is a bad book and it has only one murder.I read it only because I want to know everything.How the person got killed for example.And I didn't like who the killer is because I knew it in the beginning.I am dissapointed.But I am sure that R.L.Stine will come up with something cool for his last book-Graduation Day.
5,Jennifer Fear has just one wish,"She wants a date for the prom. She meets Duke. Duke is handsome, hot, cute and smart. Jennifer thinks he's perfect. But Jennifer Fear doesn't know that Duke is crazy and he wants to kill Jennifer!"
5,Evil at first sight...,"Of course in senior year there is always the prom. And in this issue, the book focuses about the prom. Jennifer Fear is jealous since she doesn't have a date for the prom. Later she meets Duke and Duke becomes her date."
4,bicycling the atlantic coast,"Used this book for the DC to Boston stretch. Good information about campgrounds and sights to see along the way. Donna's route was good at keeping us off most of the main roads and taking us through the more scenic back roads, but sometimes it seemed we spent more time reading the map and looking for street signs than bicycling. Good orientation information about each stretch."
1,poorly made piece of frustration,"Wow! I was so excited when I finally received this product. I thought that this was the answer to my craft organizing prayers. Folks, do not waste your money on this product. It's not worth the frustration. The box is so thin that as you struggle to open the lid it practically bends in half. Once you pry it open, the individual containers are of the same quality and lack of craftsmanship. Some lids are so big that I can't even see the point of putting it on the container. Others are so tight that it takes you 10 minutes just to force it open with a flathead screwdriver! I will never purchase this item again. I understand that aluminum is a plyable material, but if it's so plyable that you can no longer make a good quality product then it's time to switch to something else."
3,"Not bad, but not as great as I thought it'd be . . .","I think my title pretty much sums it up. It wasn't a horrible book, it was interesting and I enjoyed it, but I didn't feel it lived up to the hype."
2,Stupid,this is the stupidest movies I have ever seen! i WISH i WOULD HAVE NEVER PURCHASED IT! i'm done now!
2,same old same old,"It wasn't that it was a bad film, its just we've been here before in Texas Chainsaw, all of the now boreing Friday 13th movies. If you feel like looking at someone elses take on the same old crazy pissed off nut job chassing collage students around to kill them then rent it but I wouldnt waste the money to own it. This film is a watch one time throwaway."
4,Great mix of Humor and Horror,This film had a great mix of original humor and horror. The party and action scenes were shot very well with realistic dialog and visual effects. Humor was filtered into different scenes to give the film audience some relief from the horror that was facing this group of college aged students. Entertaining and a good show for the college aged and above who are looking for some fun and chills.
2,Sociology Book,"Arrived 3 days after latest mentioned date.I know it's bratty to expect something to be guaranteed,but I'm a college student and I needed this pretty badly.Said it'd take from a week to three,but it took like a month or so.And to think I'd have gotten it shipped faster had I been home-- which is 5000+ miles farther away from Hawaii,and on an obscure island too.I usually get it a week later back home in Saipan.I don't know really, but if you expect to get your stuff as fast, I say order as soon as possible..and be very,very patient."
1,Appaling customer service,"This seems to be a common complaint but I'd just like to confirm it from my own recent experience.Sure ArcSoft provide a demo trial (15 day) version for download. Sure, the software is easy to install and seems easy enough to use, except for DVD authoring, which I haven't tried yet due to ""hitting a brick wall"" in the editor. Try getting ANY support from their people if you dare, though. While their website has a searchable FAQ knowledgebase, it's impossible to contact any humans at ArcSoft. You just get the ""canned"" email response asking you to search the FAQ. I have tried numerous ways to get one of their staff to answer a couple of simple pre-sales questions and have been totally ignored.Appaling customer service. It's almost like they DON'T want to sell their software and makes it difficult to trust the company behind the product."
1,Go elsewhere,"Alright, I have been loyal to the arcsoft name long enough... the truth must come out! They don't fix there problems and when they do you need to buy the second edition (which then inturn has its own problems) It is not reliable, it crashes often, the effects are hit and miss, the burner works 70% of the time and the DVD wont play on a thing. THEN the quality of the DVD is not what it should be. Yea, so I am bitter, but I have waisted to much time and money and don't want the reader (you) doing the same. Go with penicle or vegas, either would be a better bet!"
1,ArcSoft Product Failure in Totality,"I got this software bundled with an hp dvd writer. The software seems usable at first, but editing with it is impossible. The scene clipping tool is ridiculously hard to use, as when you select aome portion of video to edit, the timeline will arbitrarily forward to a different point. Slding the scene progression bar forward will only get you through half of the video, and immediately sliding it backwards again will jump you all the way to the end.The software is cheap and was apparently not intended for actual use. Stay away from any Arcsoft product."
1,This is JUNK - Do NOT waste your time and money,ArcSoft ShowBiz Version2 came bundled with my new HP computer in 2005.The DVDs I attempted to burn from home movies (mini DV format) were worthless. WHY??? They were OUT OF LIP SYNC and there was no fixing it. The DVD would start out in sync and gradually slip more and more out of sync. Tech support proved worthless.I am technically adept and believe me - this sw is nothing but frustration.I bought other software for the same computer and now burn pefect DVDs - consistently.
2,Tedious,Disappointing in that there needs to be more written about this early WWII history but this book falls considerably short. The reader should be aware that the book is nothing more than a compendium of diaries of various british participants of this amazing retreat and rescue operation. As such the stories (diaries)are not always well written. The book lacks dialogue and smooth flow like a historical novel and becomes tedious in the reading. I resorting to skipping pages in the back of the book.
3,"This mounts the phone facing outward, providing no protection.","I was trying to find a cheaper solution than a Seidio, which at $29 plus $8 shipping were a little too pricey for me to commit to. When I saw these, I thought they mounted face-in, so at this price I ordered two. Turns out that they mount the phone face-out, which provides no protection at all for the screen or the keyboard (and skins will not work with this holster). I gave these three stars since they seem to work ok and the quality seems pretty good, but I'd never risk my phone to one of these (I ended up going with a Krusell leather flip, which provides me with the protection I wanted, and since I use Bluetooth 24/7, the speed of phone access is not an issue). - Not Recommended (due to lack of phone protection)"
2,Received 2 left gloves and mask was way too small,Received 2 left gloves and mask was way too small. My son could not wear the entire costume. I would not recommend to buy this costume. My son is 9 & thought buying the large would leave plenty of room for clothes underneath this was not case.
3,Not great quality,"It looks good, but not rugged enough. Rips easily. My son enjoyed wearing it, but the build quality needs to be better."
1,omg,The costume looked nothing like the picture...especially the mask..I got a size 8-10 and the mask woulnt even fit on my 8 yr olds head ...it wouldn't even fit on my 4 year olds head....it was very cheap made and I was very disappointed....as was my son.
3,Frustrated,The quality of the costume is ok but it came with 2 right hands. I returned and promptly received another costume... with 2 right hands:(
3,PERFECT!,"You get what you pay for. This is made in standard Halloween cheap material- good for one night trick-or-treating and maybe a couple months of occasional playing dress up. The MEDIUM size fits my four year old who is 47"" and 65 lbs. His clothing size pants is 6 or 7. That gives you an idea of the sizing. He will have a blast in this on Halloween. I recommend this for practical purposes. :-)"
1,Not As Pictured,"The mask of this costume is not at all what is seen in the picture. First, the mask is a hood that is not adjustable. So, if your child doesn't have a small head, they will have a hard time getting it on. Secondly, the nose is not black and it does not have nostril holes. It has one hole about the size of a dime. The eyes are small slits that your child will not be able to see properly out of. The rest of the costume was alright. I returned it to Amazon."
3,Tore the first time worn,The mask is fragile. It tore at the mouth the first time my son put it on. Oh well.....
5,Highly entertaining...and very well written,"Those not previously connected in some way with the Scouting movement will likely find this book highly entertaining nonetheless. I was disappointed to reach its end.Those that were or are Scouts / Scouters (as I was & am,) and who, like me, have experienced very painful internal conflict with the public unpleasantness the BSA has experienced in recent years will, in all likelihood, find a soothing balm in Mr. Applebome's ruminations on the issues at hand: God, Gays & Girls.Sharing Peter & Ben's (father & son's) journey via this book elicited queries from my wife: ""What in the world are you reading that you're laughing out loud at?""Thank you Peter. Good night Scouts."
3,The Scouting past and future,"The book is funny and well-written, but I was disappointed with the ending. The author suggests how to improve the BSA by lowering its standards to be like other youth groups; allowing homosexuals as youth and adult members and no uniforms are two suggestions. These two issues will hit the hot buttons of those for and against Scouting. Make your own choice. The best parts of the book concern his and his son's experiences in the 'church in the woods' and the outdoor experience. Skip the issues' chapters and you will enjoy the book more."
1,Can't judge a book by its cover,"As a Cub Scout, then Boy Scout, and now Cubmaster I picked this book up hoping to read about another fathers experience with scouting. However what I found was nothing more then a hard-left liberal political agenda with some stories of camping mixed in.The story about leaving a campout to go to the local water hole just to watch a basketball game made me question his true commitment to his son.There is a clear line between true Scouters and those just going through the motions.I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS BOOK!"
1,the education of an urban sophisticate,"I suppose it's quite a feat for a self-styled urban sophisticate to reduce himself to the level of scouting. The author's high level of sophistication is made evident because, gee whiz, he doesn't know the first thing about putting up a tent, or building a fire, or anything else that country bumpkins acquire by sheer instinct. To the reader's ultimate relief, the author manages to get through his scouting experience without having to shed too much of his leftward leanings. After admonishing the scouting establishment for their rigidness and intolerance, Applebome displays the left wing variety in full force, holding the scouts to standards of PC rectitude that he would dare not expect of any other private organization. His book amounts to one laborious backhanded compliment."
3,4.5 Gallon Drain Pan,"The Pan DOES NOT have a lid. Every tried transporting a pan of oil without a lid? Anyway, long story short, i returned this for a refund and bought a better one with a lid at Autozone for less money."
4,Nice - holds a lot of oil and easy to Handle,Great oil drain pan.Holds 4.5 gallons of oil and is easy to hamdle.Has a drip preventer lip around the top edge.Very Happy with it.
3,case,average case. there is a pouch for the extra battery but it doesn't secure it well. I lost my spare battery; when i pulled the camera out the spare batter must of slipped out as well.
5,Simply Great!,"I love this cookbook! Kevin and his mom start with a basic premise: that you actually want to learn how to cook! This is different from many other ""college-student"" cookbooks, which assume you just want a cheese hot dog in the microwave. Kevin and Mom walk even the very beginner cook through the recipes, which end up being REAL FOOD- that you wouldn't be embarassed to serve to someone -and not a glorified TV-dinner. The ""Difficulty Rating,"" ""Mom's Tips"" and ""Mom Warning"" are each helpful features to the recipes."
5,My Husband Begs...,"for me to make Overstuffed Calzones from Help! My Apartment Has a Kitchen. This weekend I even made it for vegans using mozzerella flavored shredded tofu instead of cheese. This recipe is excellent for entertaining, for Sundays, any time you have time for the bread to rise. And because it's just veggies and meat for stuffing you can experiment with any number of items. Every recipe in this book is a winner in my house!"
3,Cute,"I was hoping for more funny but what I got was a little bit of funny in the beginning and the rest - recipes. But then again, it is a cookbook so I shouldn't be surprised. I bought this for a relative who was basically using her kitchen for storage and spending more money than necessary eating out. The recipes included in the book are simple and tasty. All in all it's not the best cookbook I've ever seen but certainly not the worst either. It's middle of the road."
4,How to make a new cook from scratch,"This funny and easy to read book makes absolutely no assumptions about its readers. It includes step-by-step recipes, with ""Mom Tips"" on the side for those little hints that most cookbooks dont' bother mentioning (like to not overcook garlic when browning it, because it will become bitter, or to put hardboiled eggs immediately into cold water, to make them easier to peel).The book really does include instructions on ""how to boil water."" Unfortunately, the instructions for that are wrong. The author suggests starting with warm water instead of cold so it will boil faster. As an *experienced* cook, I can tell you that previously boiled warm water has a flat taste (from being de-oxygenated) that it will impart to some dishes, and, even more important, warm tap water is much more likely to be contaminated with lead leeched from old water pipes. This isn't a deal breaker - the book is still worth reading for a novice cook. But take the advice with 1/8 tsp of salt."
4,Wonderful!,I bought this for my husband when we were in college. He loved it and now 7 years later he is a great cook in our kitchen. Very helpful on the days I don't want to cook!
5,Great Book for someone renting their first apartment,"Great Book for someone living on their own in the real world for the first time. It actually teaches you how to cook, and the recipes are good, too."
4,Moms have the best tips...,"The book's title is terrific, and I really like the Mom Tips scattered throughout the book. There are some interesting recipes, not just the usual suspects. Of course, that means that this book is not the best choice if you were to own only one cookbook. You'd need a starter book with recipes with fewer ingredients. That said, if the intended recipient of this book has had some cooking experience, this would be a great book to give. It would make a thoughtful housewarming gift for someone getting their first apartment with no roommates...yippee! That IS call for a celebration. With it's clever drawings, this book would be a good companion to 50 Ways to Leave Your Mother, a humorous advice book for young adults new to a life away from Mom and Dad. So let's start this party with the Deviled Eggs, Garlic Bread and Spicy Bean Dip. (Recipes found in Kevin Mills' book.)"
5,A Cookbook Anyone (Everyone) Can Use,"I can say after owning the book for several years that I now have tested EVERY recipe. Tonight was my first roast turkey and it came out perfect. Each recipe has warnings and tips (I needed it). For example, Kevin Mills tells you the gibbets are in the neck cavity and the giblets are in the lower cavity. Thanks Kevin for the warning! The turkey turned out perfect and I received rave reviews (Whew)."
3,Help! My Apartment Has a Kitchen Cookbook,"The recipes and Mom Hints look great. But the paper is so filmsy and light weight- like newsprint ,that I don't think the pages would hold up for every long at all. I know how I cook and the pages can get messy!"
4,Easy to follow but still disappointing.,"I bought this book hoping to find easy & plain recipes. The easy is accurate but most the recipes are too ""seasoned"" for my tastes. I prefer plain food and was disappointed that so many of the recipes just don't appeal to me. I'll be passing this book along to a friend who isn't as finicky.If you are looking for very basic and/or less fancy recipies try ""Where's Mom Now That I Need Her"". Otherwise, ""Help"" may work better for you than it did for me."
3,Too Easy,"This source lives up to exactly what it purports to be but does not surpass expectations. It is similar to another ""Level 1"" cookbook; ""The Kitchen Survival Guide"". If you are 25+ years old, boys (and girls)and not cognitively impaired you've probably learned the stuff in here already. To be fair, i have to say that it has an easily understandable format and lots of humor. But the recipes are too basic and rely too much on non-fresh ingredients. I guess it's time for me to tackle some of rachel ray's or jamie Oliver's stuff."
3,Not what I expected,"The book I recieved had the same title and contents as the one I thought I ordered, but the cover is different. I almost sent it back, but I realized the cover was updated a few years ago. I will be keeping the book just because I do not feel like returning it and it is essentially the same thing, but I am disappointed that I did not get what was expected.I did get the book pretty quickly and had no other problems, I am just disappointed I was not warned that what I was getting is not what is advertised in the picture."
4,A sequel and a bridge,"With the battle won in the previous book, and Cefwyn seated upon the throne of Ylesuin, Cefwyn undertakes to rule his new kingdom. However, many things are not what they seem. Cefwyn's barons scheme against him, the Quinatine church stands against his friends, and strange things are happening. So, the king sends his friends off to safety, and begins scheming his own way through the morass. Situations turn, and new enemies and crises are encountered at every turn.I liked the story in this book. Within, you can see that Tristen is in many ways a child learning about the world around him, and how it really works. At times the author brings you to the edge of your seat, and makes you care for the characters. Unfortunately, this book has the feel of a bridge, one connecting the previous book to the next. That is, however, my only complaint. This is a very good book indeed."
3,"Least memorable of the four, but essential to the whole.","I think the title says it all. Definitely a second-in-a-series, but very essential to the continuation of the rest. Lots of small details and intricate innuendos. A quick read though to get to the third book."
4,True Wurlitzer,"This one is pretty good, although I have heard better. It's best to hear wurlitzer music live, because you don't just hear it, but you feel it."
2,Not great,"Interesting storyline, great gay scenes which is the reason for the 2 stars, but the movie is very low budget and the end is not realistic. The reviews on here all 4 and 5 star must be written by the producers or their friends. I fell for it and bought the movie, fell asleep for about 10 minutes what I did watch was just ok."
5,Totally Unmissable,"This is an amazing film, so good I went to the cinema twice to see it.It has everything: drama, suspense, comedy, brilliant cinematography, its a real thriller...with a good dash of sex.Miss it at your peril"
2,Dark and disturbing,"I wish I had given into the feeling I had of not watching this about 30 mins into it. It's disturbing, and I feel worse for having reached the end of it. Twisted and dark, yes, so enjoy if that's what you're after. Big Hammer fan here, unsure of what it has in common at all with classic Hammer Horror. Sex perhaps."
1,big gaping plot hole,"this is kind of a spoiler, but it kind of makes the whole movie a bit silly.Why would you want to trick women to come onto your island when it's the men that are infertile?Makes the entire premise of the movie a big ""Doh!""It's an okay movie except the writer suffered from a complete breakdown in critical thinking. The end is waaaay too choppy---maybe the director finally figured out the gaping hole in the plot and thought if he got real choppy with the scenes, he'd confuse the audience so much they wouldn't notice."
2,"Easy, serious practices for carpal tunnel ONLY","PROS:-easy for beginners-careful, thorough instructions-good for carpal tunnel-3 short sessions-good for low fitness levelsCONS:-DANGEROUS for cubital tunnel, thoracic outlet, and ulnar nerve injuries - will worsen them!-too easy for dedicated yogis-tone is more serious than fun"
2,love/hate,"Wonderful music, brilliant dancers, hideous choreography.This looked like a Saturday Night Live parody of a ballet. Neumeier did the worst possible thing a choreographer could do, he made the dancers look bad.Aurelie Dupont is stunning, but it was painful to see her degraded in this way. Spare yourself the pain."
3,average to ok performance,sets & props were wooden; costumes were ok; music was great; dancers were great; overall production left me wanting something more.
1,Strange,Tis was a strange children's book. I was also disappointed in the pictures. I am glad I tried it when it was free.
2,Buy our stuff...,"Not quite a great ending. I WOULD purchase more books if I felt that the publisher wasn't so cheap. I recommend looking for ""If you have a hat"". Well delivered free book and the quality enticed me to buy other books and pay fully for them."
4,Cute!,"THE STORY OF MISS MOPPET is the cute story of a cat name Miss Moppet who's been played by a mouse. Their antics could only remind you to the famous cartoon series Tom and Jerry.It's a very short story, equip with beautiful water-color illustrations for your enjoyment and to help nurture the children's imagination. Cute plot and good for a quick read."
2,Not Easy to read,"This book did not display well on my Paperwhite, difficult to see....I found it frustrating, asked for a refund. I don't recommend it."
3,The story of Miss moppet,I like the book because the cat gets revenge on the mouse and she lost the mouse and the mouse got out of the hole in the bag
3,The Story of Miss Mopet,"The Story of Miss Mopet is a very good childrens book. The story was about a cat that is bothered by a little mouse.The cat,Miss Mopet, Trys to kill the annoying little mouse. The mouse is clever, the cat is dumb, so when the cat trys to capture the mouse, it fails. Finally , the mouse catches the mouse in a rag. The cat didn't know that the rag had a hole in it.The mouse got away, and continued to annoy the little cat. This was a very good book."
1,Missing pictures,"This book is missing the pictures on my Kindle Fire. Only the text appears. Amazon and Kite Press clearly have no quality control whatsoever. This lack of quality control is giving Amazon, Kindle, and digital publishing a bad name.Please FIX!I couldn't find any other way of complaining to Amazon. I want my 0.99 cents back."
3,Not Yet,"Both my children are readers,however neither one likes the e-book version of Miss Moppet.They both said ""just because"". I gave it 3 stars because as a Mother I found the e-book the same as the paperback book."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Mavra Chang time.The second book in the Well World series introduces a new character, Mavra Chang, basically an interstellar rogue.She gets involved in something a lot more serious than just crime, as a scientist manages to reconnect with the Well World - and if he makes things go wrong there, it will be very very bad.This leads Mavra and some others into a Well World adventure and all that such a journey entails.3.5 out of 5"
1,The Artichoke Trail- Not A Trail I'd Follow,"I found this book to be much below my expectations. The listings were very oudated, and way too many of the restaurants reviewed or listed were not vegetarian restaurants, but what the author considered ""natural"". The listings did not indicate if a restaurant was vegan, vegetarian, or if it served Meat of Fish, and the natural food stores listings was very incomplete,with no directions or indications of facilities offered as in The Tofu Tollbooth by Dar Williams. I retuned the book."
5,Good Bridge Book,"Medical Acupuncture, A Western Scientific Approach is a collection of essays on acupuncture that helps serve as the foundation of a bridge between acupunture as practiced in Tradtional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and acupunture as practiced from a western biomedical or neuroanatomic perspective. It is not a stand alone book. It is not a practical ""how to"" book. It is a solid ""bridge"" book that allows the western trained mind gain a better understanding of acupuncture and how it works / may work."
1,Did not live up to expectaion,"The go-cart is much smaller that it appeared to be. My 2 year old barely fits. These is no reverse and it is a sit in toy. So the child has to get completely out to turn around, or you have to follow them around. The steering column is not straight so the steering wheel has to be sideways to drive straight. All together it is not a very impressive to. My daughter enjoys it very much but I should not have got rid of her Lil' Quad."
4,Dora's review,"The power button is little hard for a 12 month old. The product stated it was for a 12 to 36 month old, but the red button is little hard to push and even hards an adults finger at times. I find my 12 month old granddaughter using both hands at times."
4,good protection and fairly thin,"the styling is questionable but it works well. it is fairly thin and did not make the phone too bulgy. however, i ended up getting the incipio stashback case instead because it was more protection and more features"
5,IPHONE COVER,Excellent quality and it fitted my husband's phone so well. I liked it so much I got one with a pink back for my daughter.
3,Neutral,"Case is good quality. Couple of things.1. It snaps right in place, but its hard to remove the case. With iphone 5 black u may have a possiblity of scratching it.2. The case doesnt cover the face on the sides of it.But its a good quality case otherwise."
3,Misleading Audio,"This is essentially a DVD that has High Res Video Content but standard DVD-V quality audio content. I have checked the packaging and the advertising content on Amazon after having purchased the disc and they are very coy about hiding this info.The Video content is stunning and I second the comments previously made.My dissapointment is that I bought it hoping to have High Res audio content. As a DVD-V audio format it doesn't begin to compare sonically to several ""Red Book"" audio CDs that I own of the same music.So if you like watching classical music in high def video but a low def audio eperience, this is for you. I would have hoped for more truth in advertising.I will be sticking with SACD as the prefered high res audio format for classical music."
4,Excellent.,"I'd rather the sound in PCM 24 bits / 96 khz, but all in allthe graphic definition is great, and the sound is very good.I like it."
3,Brandenburg,"It's a nice recording, however Claudio Abbado looks like he is completely out of place.This ensemble could very well play without a conductor."
4,Excellent,"Can only applaude this Blu Ray, Claudio Abbado is a fantastic director and I like the way it is filmed and the camera moves very well. I love it, can hear it over and over. Daniel from Mexico City."
3,Good Review Book,"I bought this book for my wife because she is reviewing for the NCLEX. She thought that it was useful; however, it is somewhat outdated! In general, it helps."
3,Good......but misleading,"This book contains themed sections of Tommy Coopers usually funny patter (mostly relying on word puns). However it includes only very few tricks. One of these is a smoke trick featuring chemicals now difficult to get hold of in a regular chemists, but probably not in the early 70s). The jokes are good, but youd have to be a fan to appreciate this book. It is not, like the title suggests, a magic 'trick' book."
3,Cheaply made - not worth the price,"Very disappointed in the flimsy quality. The price is exhorbitant for what you get: a stamped sheet metal panel plus 5 PLASTIC snap in rings. While the description screams ""METAL"" see my previous sentence. And, this sells at just a bit below the price of all-metal 1RU units! Definitely not pro quality and I advise you to look elsewhere."
3,Management rings too flimsy,"The product for the most part does what it is supposed to, however plastic that the cable management rings are made of is brittle so they can be snapped off. Making the rings out of metal or a more flexible plastic would work better."
3,Not as good as the old ones,"I had one of these bags 4 years ago when my oldest was a baby and I loved it! I was able to use it as a diaper bag, it fits 2-3 diapers and a small pack of wipes, and you can throw a burpcloth and bib in there too. The inside works great as far as insulating, and the newer version holds more bottles with the addition of a zippered extension. But the top is what I couldn't stand on the new version, the old one just zipped closed, this one has a velcro tab and two zippers. Also, there was some funky staining on the inside. Its hard to explain, it looks like black smudges/scrapes. I'm giving it 3 stars because it does do what it says it does, but I don't like the new design. They should have stuck with the same design that made this bag a winner in the first place."
5,Pretty good!!,"Nice little bag for the price. It does the job. I got it just to take a few baby items with me so that i dont have to take my huge diaper bag, and it is the perfect thing for that. I still havent try to put a warm bottle in there and see how long it could be warm for. But I am rrying not to get my baby used to warm formula. It has plenty of pockets i take a few diapers, wipes, a bottle, a little formula dispenser, my keys, wallet and a burp clothes, and tbere is still space for more. Great item I recomended it.."
2,It's great until one of the zippers pulls off,"I share the same zipper experience some others reviewers have had. I pulled on the double zipper pull too hard and one of the zipper pulls fell off its track. And its impossible to fix. I don't think this would happen if it just had one zipper tgrack and pull on the top. Oh well, I really liked it while it lasted. Too bad."
4,"Love the brand, smaller than I thought...","I have been looking all over for the perfect smaller diaper bag, instead of carrying around my HUGE Columbia diaper bag. I got tired of carrying around the big one to short trips to the store or Dr. Munchkin is my all time FAVORITE brand. I have always liked the things they came out with. I came across this online and HAD TO HAVE IT!! I looked at pictures online thinking it would be the perfect size. Well I was wrong. It is a little smaller than expected. I can only fit about 3 diapers and a pack of on-the-go wipes. You probably have room for one bottle and the formula dispenser. I had to switch wallets just to fit one in there.All in all, its perfect for a short outing, but I wish it came just a little bit bigger. I got the beige one and I was wanting the blue one. Amazon should let you be able to pick what color you want... that's if it's available.I do recommend but be prepared to not be able to store much in there!"
4,Very small but handy,"This bag is small. Insulation is good, however, can carry limited sippy or bottles. Very nice for an hour's trip to the grocery or the mall. Change of clothes might not fit."
4,very useful,We have had two of these bags. The bag itself is very roomy. We put diapers and a baggie w/wipes in the front pocket and use the main compartment for food. We can fit the large flat ice packs in the main compartment with enough food & a sippy cup or bottle for outings. This is actually the second bag like this we own. The only thing that would make it better is if it were lined w/a clear plastic liner to seal it to make it spill proof and easer to wipe clean. I had to replace the last bag because things spilled and got into the seams and it just got gross after a while. I have the thrown the 2nd one in the washer and let it air dry and that seems to work pretty well.
1,Baby On-The-Go Bag,"My daughter was unable to fit much in the bag to use as a baby bag for her dolls. Instead, she uses it as her lunch bag and loves it. The only thing is a regular size water bottle does not fit. Instead, I put a juice box or small water bottle in for her school lunch."
3,Good Story--Expected More,"What I loved most about this novel was that it was set in my hometown. Ms. Nelson has a good feel for the city and she certainly placed the characters in the right neighborhoods for their socio-economic ranks.However, I had a difficult time believing that the affair would last so long before Evan did anything. This part was the only reason why I didn't like the book as much. It would take nearly a year from the time he discovers his wife is having an affair to wake up from his Jodi-coma? I can't imagine a Chicago guy doing this...or rather not doing anything.Minor drawback perhaps, but a key one for this reader. Looking forward to the next work."
2,Not what the title says.,Test Questions in this book have very little to do with being an activity director. I work as one and a lot of the questions are medical and deal with the social security system which we don't have much to do with. This will not help you on the National Certification Exam.
5,Nothing compares for light gathering,"I've owned these Binoculars for 15 years, they're bullet proof and have no equal in or out of they're price range. When you use them at night as I do for commercial fishing you see the difference they have in they're ability to gather light. I also own a pair of Canon 18X50 image stabilized and I use them mostly during the day because you can't beat Canon's image stabilization but at night the image from the Canon's is just a black circle when looking at un-illuminated objects on the water but the Fujinons show the object illuminated better than with the naked eye. Well worth the price if you need the light gathering ability."
5,This music is really catchy!,I love Millie so I have wanted this for a long time. Sometimes I hesitate buying the music books for musicals. The arrangements can slaughter the real music sometimes. This one is really good though. It holds of lot of the good chords that you hear on the soundtrack. It is also really fun to sing a long with. I think this book is definately one of the best vocal books from a musical.
5,Thoroughly Modern Millie Selections Book,"Found this under ""new and used"" - thus, paid a little less for a new selections book. It has plenty of songs in it (lots of page turning if you're accompanying)."
4,Satisfied.,"Thoroughly Modern Millie has been one of my favorite musicals ever since I performed in it a few years ago. The songs are catchy and heartfelt, Gimme Gimme is my favorite. The piano accompaniment is very good in the book. It feels very complete."
5,So far so good,Only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far. I've bought another brand as well so we'll see which holds up the longest.
4,Series is picking up nicely,"After the terrible outing by Carl Bowen's first book in the series, ""Vampire"", Gherbod Fleming introduces us -- finally -- to the world of the hunters. I enjoyed his more human side of the hunters, showing the flaws and inner demons of each person. My only problem is the horrific copy editing done by Melissa Thorpe... spelling, grammar, etc. If she would have simply read through the manuscript, the problems are obvious and easy to fix. The publisher, White Wolf, needs to hire someone else. But definitely keep Gherbod around."
4,Great middle of the road,"Just as others have said. This machine is nothing fancy, no special type, no bells and whistles. But it's easy to understand, easy to operate and works like a charm. A great deal for someone with basic labeling needs."
1,Doesn't fit over extended battery,"Like the other reviewer, I too thought that this would cover the screen. Unfortunately, it doesn't. But more importantly, this does not fit over the extended battery. So I guess it will be useful 1/2 the time? I guess for $.99 that's not bad."
1,It's all bad,"The case arrived with a small crack. That should have been my first warning. It does NOT cover the screen, which I thought it did (probably my own fault). But the bigger issue is that the cover won't come off! What's the point of having a two-battery system like a Blackjack when you can't get the cover off to replace the battery? I'm now trying to figure out how to remove this ""case"" so I can replace the battery."
1,Please do yourself a favor,"Never, ever watch this pitiful movie. Don't even watch it for free on cable. Beyond bad acting. Worse special effects than Sesame Street. One scene shows a puppet's head being ripped off with fake looking syrup. This was suppose to be a human person and the syrup was suppose to be blood.A young looking guy with a beard plays an old man. He did not have one strand of grey in his beard or in his hair.I rate this movie with one star. This is not eveil dead on acid. There is absolutely nothing in the world to compare this nonsense to."
4,Nice collector's item!,A must have for Amazing Blondel admirers. Although the sound of the interview on the included dvd is rather mediocre this box is a nice collector's item.
4,"Naipaul's history of ""nowhere""","THis is a great book, a history of the founding of a place - where Naipaul was born - that virtually no one cares about. As such, there is nihilism at the very core of the book, which Naipaul emphasizes by beginning with a tribe (just a name) whose only existing reference was that it was annihilated during the colonization.And yet, this book is brilliantly written, full of drama of torture and interminable trials, great and bitter ironies that lead to what Trinidad became (or didn't), all of it adding up to a sense of the passage of human life and striving. I loved this book: it is a fascinating rumination by a highly talented writer, a dark essay on futility and non-history.It may seem obscure, but then, so is much of the Third WOrld's history. That is one of Naipaul's points. He is a true master."
4,Highly recommended,A great book to have during the clinical year. Was very helpful as a quick reference as well as a guideline for writing notes.One improvement would be to have the book available as a laminated version to hold up to the physical abuse after utilizing it so frequently.
3,FED EX LOST OUR SHIPMENT,"I CANT REVIEW THE PRODUCT SADLY, FED EX LOST THE SHIPMENT IN THE WAREHOUSE. SO THEY REFUNDED OUR CREDIT CARD. IT WAS THE LAST JUMP-N-CARRY INSTOCK, WE COULDN'T GET ANOTHER ONE. SO WE TRIED TO FIND THIS PRODUCT IN TOWN BUT ONLY SEARS CARRIED IT FOR TWICE THE COST OF AMAZON, NEARLY 700.00. SO WE ASKED AROUND AND INSTEAD GOT THE SUGGESTION TO BUY A HEAVY MARINE BATTERY FOR CLOSE TO $300. WE STRAPPED THE BATTERY TO A DOLLEY AND CUT THE ENDS OF OF A JUMPER CABLE AND ADDED BATTERY CABLES TO IT, ATTACHING THEM TO THE BATTERY POSTS. THEN WE GOT AN OVERNIGHT BATTERY CHARGER FOR $30 AT THE HARBOR FREIGHT. OVERALL THIS REPLACEMENT WORKS VERY WELL. WE ALSO DRILLED TWO HOLES INTO THE UPPER SUPPORT ON THE DOLLEY, ADDED TO LONG BOLTS COVERED IN A NON CONDUCTIVE RUBBER, THEY HOLD THE CLAMP ENDS OF THE JUMPER CABLES WHEN NOT IN USE."
4,PMC Docking Station,Allows you to charge and sync your Zen PMC. I lost my cord and this was an adequate substitue.
1,Recommended by a wonderful reader; paperback is rough to even see,"Okay, it's really not fair to the great Oriana to diss a book I simply could not get into. Perhaps that was because the print in the long paperback was unusually small. Or perhaps it was just too much info. I made it through 25 pages and said, ""Either I am not smart enough or this is just horrible."" Still do not know which reason is true.PS no, this is not a review of the hardcover, but the paperback!"
1,disappointment,The novel's inside cover claims this book is a masterpiece covering the civil war in Lebanon in the The style of Hemingway and Malroux. On the positive side Oriana Fallachi does describe in detail the devastation and destruction of what was once known as the Paris of the Middle East. But the focus of the novel should be on character development and plot. I found the novel totally missing these elements and I lost any interest in staying with it through 600 pages.
1,inchallah ...?,"sorry that i cant be positive, despite the hopeful title which literally means: ""god willing...""But i couldnt go past the first 20 pages of this soup of pseudo-prosaic work..."
2,Out of date,"Although it is a classic, it's a shame it doesn't have a thorough revision, which makes it look awkward, old-fashioned and less profitable than I thought."
4,I'v been lokking for this stuff in WIDESCREEN,"I guess you could say I'm a pretty big fan of this stuff, I believe all in this set were, WIDESCREEN movies Picture res- was fare to excellent, So, real good set of DVDs, There seens to be a lot of good , Sword and sandal DVD stuff out there right now, being the fan that I I'm think I'm gettin some more of this stuff."
1,I hate to break it to you...,"This show could've been cool if they would've stayed closer to the true World of Darkness atmosphere. Vampire: the Masquerade (which is what this is based off, and it's not just ONE novel by Rein*Hagen) is one of the darkest, most well thought out worlds on paper. FOX destroyed it! They basically said: Lets make Melrose Place, but with vampires! We'll offer Mark Rein*Hagan a lot of money to sign off on it and it will be really cool! Well, it wasn't. It could've been the next X-Files if they really would've done their homework. But...they didn't. So now we have another cheesy, half baked show about Vampires. I'm glad they cancelled it. Maybe they realized that they were ruining something really good."

4,Memories Revamped,"I recently bought Kindred: The Embraced in regards to remembering a few years back of how fond I was of the mini-series. Watching the series now is kind of funny, because I remember it to be a lot more serious. However, it was a great buy, interesting characters, and they did a great job with working the PC Game. I am sad to see the episodes ending the way it did, and it would have been great if the series continued, because each character had amazing potential, and the stories were just beginning. I hesitated quite a bit thinking if I really wanted to buy. But all in all a great collection, don't think twice to buy...enjoy!"
4,Intriguing...despite the soap-operaness,"It's such a disappointment to see that this series lost it's star. The first episode is a tad over the top (Alexandra in particular), but the other episodes were great.I haven't seen all the episodes until reccently because how much I hated the first episode, not to mention that I thought the Canadian series, Forever Knight was much better. However, the two series both give a lot to vampire fans. The technology in this series was amazing and I to my suprise I like it much more than the reccent vampire shows I've seen lately."
5,A WORK OF GOTHIC ART,THIS IS THE BEST MODERN VAMPIRE S. THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN. THE ACTORS ARE AS MAGNIFICENT AS THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL. IT IS THRILLING AND EROTIC. A MUST SEE.
5,The best ever.,"This show had the coolest plot. I am somewhat young and this introduced me to role-playing. Julian Luna was a very interesting character, Cash was cute, and I'm glad Lilly sliced off Eddie Fiori's head. He deserved it."
3,"One minute facinating, the next, hideous :(","As an avid Masquerade player, and romantic vampire addict, I was ecstatic when this show was on. The storylines have very little, some nothing, to do with the White Wolf gane. Looking at ""Kindred"" for a TV show though and not comapring it to the game, it isn't all bad. The actors are gorgeous. The Nosferatu player is especially entrancing for the character instead of for the look. HOWEVER, the some of the storylines, especially the very first one, are positively hideous. I don't wonder why the show cancelled after such a bad first impression. The rating here is an average. Some episodes are 5 stars (the last one) and some are 1 at most(the first one). Watching these is like eating a Baked Alaska with rocks in it. All in all, pretty good."
1,kickfest,"Good fight in the sense that it was a good tactic and fight plan from Aldo and his team, but it's not much to watch. It basically looks like Aldo trained playing soccer and doing side volleys, then simply showed up to the fight and kept with it. So if you want to see some good kicking, I say stick with a soccer game, because beyond that, there wasn't much fighting going on here. I definitely can't blame him though, I'd be afraid to fight Faber head on as well."
3,Nice collection of the first drummer superstar,"Good collection for students or fans of the swing/big band era, especially percussionists. Krupa, ""The Chicago Flash,"" was the first big drum star, and thus set the stage for everyone from Buddy Rich to Phil Collins. I think the serious jazz connoisseur would rather skip this anthology and go for CDs of his original albums instead."
5,"Unusual colors, large crystals","It's a bit pricey with shipping, but I bought this because this brand has unusual colors. I needed purple for a King Cake, and here in Illinois you just can't find purple sugar. I actually like this brand quite a bit, and would recommend it.The colors are nice and bright compared to some cheaper brands I've seen. The first thing I noticed, however, is that the sugar crystals are LARGE compared to the near-shavings I get from the colored sugars I got at the local grocery store. I guess I'll have to go buy the Green and Gold ones too, so they match next time."
1,Junk changer,"Just got this charger a week ago, used it once. Second time out, it made a pop and died. When I called the company I was told that this charger is discontinued. I have owned two of these chargers in the past and they both died of fan failure. I am now getting ready to box this thing up and send it to the warranty place to see if they will replace the unit. Buy another? Never again..."
5,Fills the bill,"Although larger than I had wanted, it performs exactly like the smaller version which is no longer available, which is fantastic. Just which it had the 5 year warranty instead of 1 year."
3,Limited,This is a good charger but not great. The smart aspect of this charger sometimes doesn't let me charge batteries that can still be rescued. The low jump start amp rating is also limited to small passenger cars and won't kick over my camper or a large pickup.
1,black and decker junk,"i purchased this charger having faith in the name black and decker- big mistake, product is just shy of being junk, this charger will not charge a dead battery. such as a battery that is dead from leaving a dome or interior light on. it will show a fault that says battery has internal short. not the case, if you take an old charger and get a slight charge then this charger will charge just fine. how many people buy new batteries because of this. also the cooling fan has started to make noises as if the fan were trying to escape. all and all bad bad purchase, very disappointing"
5,the only way to charge a battery,"this is my 2nd charger like this. i didnt like the first one as well as i like this one. but i did like it good enough that when it broke i replaced it with the same thing. on the old one when you left it hooked up to your battery to keep it at full charge the fan on that charger ran all the time. and thats what went bad on it. this new one when the battery reaches full charge and shuts down the cooling fan also shuts down. that should add years of service. also you can just set the charger on 40 amps and let it go. the auto feature wont let it cook your battery. as the battery gets closer to fully charged the amps will drop back on its own. and if you leave it hooked up and the battery gets low enough to start the charger, it will charge it at like 3 or 4 amps. it is a automatic charger and it works. and now with the fan being updated its really great. it also has the jump start feature which can get you going in a hurry if needed....thanks...."
1,"poor quality, but it looks nice.","I have owned this unit for 14 months and used it fairly often. The unit looks very good and feels solid. However, all the voltage setting were the same for AGM, Wet and Gel,... and they were too high at 15.1 volts while the recommended voltages on batteries were either 14,4 or 14,8,.. there is no ability to adjust,.. this would probably be even worse for Gel Cells. These AGM and Gell batteries are very sensitive to voltage, as the electrolyte can be dried up by over heating.After about 6 months of use, the cooling fan started making a horrible noise and the vibrations keep it from running at top speed.Now, in the past week the top charging voltage has dropped from 15.1 to 12.9 when set to 10 amps and 13.5v when set to 40 amps. This is not enough to fully charge the Battery before the charger turns off and says that the battery is ""Full.""Perhaps I have a defective unit from the start,.. but this has been very frustrating."
1,Too Many Failers!!,"I have had several of the BD chargers like this and all have failed. The fan failed in almost every one. Also, had problems with pushbutton failures and one locked up in the FO5 overtemp mode and could not be used for anything. Lots of mailing back for repairs. The BD web site currently shows the warranty period to be only 1 year not 2years as indicated in this add. The people that does the repair on these units recommended the newer Stanley units, Stanley BC4009 40 Amp Automatic Battery Charger. Newer, more automatic, cheaper & probably has a longer warranty. The Amazon ratings for the newer charger are also much higher. Good luck with this one."
2,Over heating Smoking,"I Have had this charger for a year and a half, the cooling fan would stop working at times. Now the fan has stoped and the unit is overheating.When it worked if was fine. The unit should last longer than 1.5 years. I am returning if for a replacement under warranty."
1,Watch out for this manufacturer,"Coby's standard warranty is 90 days. I know why. Their equipment just ceases to function after that. They don't have any reasonable post-warranty repair/exchange policy. In fact when my TFDVD-7700 stopped working about 6 months out of warranty, they suggested that I either ""take it to a local repair shop"" or ""buy another one.""Horrible product, horrible customer service."
2,MEDIOCRE PRODUCT,"We bought this DVD player on the premise that the static problem on the 7700 model had been corrected. Whatever the cause, our TF-DVD7705 model is now inoperable after 18 months of light/careful use. We get a 'Bad Disk' error now anytime we try to load a DVD.The 'tablet' concept is cute, and the product was convenient until it failed. I recommend using the lithium battery as much as possible - it lasts 2+ movies without recharge. The car adapter was particularly sensitive to the slightest touch. This becomes pretty aggravating after you reach behind the seats with the remote for the 10th time to try to restart/fast-forward a movie."
1,Disappointed that Kindle Prime borrowing does not work on iPad,"I was disappointed that I purchased an Amazon Prime membership to use the free lending library only to discover that it does not include the Kindle ap for iPad. I just spent $79 for Amazon Prime and one of the benefits is not available for my device. I think this should be more plainly stated. I wonder what other ""benefits"" will not work because I do not own a Kindle."
4,The Japanese Experiance in Indonesia:Selected Memoirs of 194,"This superb little collection of essays and journal notes sheds light on an obscure, yet important aspect of Asian history. We Westerners tend to give the wartime aims of Japan a uniformly dark aspect, yet there were idealists among the Japanese conquerors who dreamed of an Asia free of Western imperialism. One cannot be naive in dealing with this subject - the brunt of the Japanese occupation machine was geared to subjugation and exploitation. Yet in the East Indies there were many Japanese administrators who prepared the Indonesians for the inevitable battle with the returning Dutch."
4,Essential Wynton Kelly,"Originally released in 1951, is an import only release. The music here has seldom been reissued, and pianist Wynton Kelly is in trio formation. Influenced by Bud Powell and Teddy Wilson, Kelly was still a teenager at the time her recorded this. Superb material!Wynton Kelly (piano)Franklin Skeete or Oscar Pettiford (bass)Lee Abrams (drums)"
5,One of the best books ever,"The author is so generous with his creativity. Each small episode contains a novel's worth of invention, and some scenes are amazing and unusually beautiful. Also, the book works on several different layers of fiction. You get so used to the Alice-in-Wonderland fantasy of the Antipodes that, by contrast, you find yourself wondering if the Doctor's well-documented history (with convincing footnote citations) could be factual."
5,Brilliant--the best novel of its decade,"As most of the other reviewers have noted, this novel is amazing. It combines the best of mainstream literary fiction with the best of surreal fantasy. Readers of both types of fiction will love this book. I am somewhat perplexed by Cox's comments. The fact is, when we read a book we suspend our disbelief--we don't eradicate it. So the fantasy sequences, no matter what their origin, should still be evocative and powerful to most readers. In fact, their origin makes them all the more powerful to me, as does the allegorical content. This is one of the few books to both uplift me and to make me cry (in a non-sentimental, non-manipulative way)."
5,Live and Learn,"Those who know, know Eris and her followers have been around a very LONG time. One can truly learn EVERYTHING necessary about truth and magick here. Just read -- and take the time to understand this excellent book. Have FUN."
3,a blessed-o-teric wonderland of fanciful truths,"just as lying and 'magical' as any other religious text... just... shorter. and it's got all of the other stuff. i mean... the bagavad was so long... y'know. also, 'cos it's short, it has got less of the author's comment in it... which is good for a religious text"
3,An amusing diversion,"This was a silly little book. Does it contain profound truths which will forever alter the way you perceive the world? Didn't seem to. A lot of clip art and ditties pasted together by a couple of very stoned hippies with a unique sense of humor. Robert Anton Wilson would have us believe that this thin paperback is the secret key to illumination -- but after having read, and enjoyed, all of Wilson's books, I eventually came to the sad conclusion that he seems to have his head up his a$$ -- and would like all of us to do likewise (the ""Cult of the Stinky Ostrich""???). When this book was first circulated, it was a true revolutionary act, and it remains an interesting Historical document -- immature as the contents may well be. If you liked this, be sure to check out the ""Book of the SubGenius"", which expands upon the topics covered with more intelligence and depth."
5,i present you to your new religion,"to the punks whos mowhawks long been shaved, to the hippes who work in the offices, to the class clown who never grew up, to the thinkers who never stop wondouring i give you your new religion.this great book introduces the religion of discordianism to the world. acting as both a hilariouse parody and a genuinly thought provoking religion discordianism forges the two together making you wonder if it your supposed to laught or think. from the curse of the gray face to the sacred chao this book has storys that make you laught and change your outlook on life .and with 100 pages you can finish it in a day.best 15 bucks iv ever speant"
1,moof!,This book goes against everything Discordia stands for. It is a disgrace to the religion. All of it is lies. Even the true parts.
5,Get The Illuminet Press Edition rather than the Loompanics,"The 5th edition, from Illuminet,(i.e. the one with the purple cover) has an extended introduction that more than makes up for the $2.00 price difference. (evidently there is also a Steve Jackson Games edition, but I've never seen it so I can't comment) Kerry Thornley, AKA Lord Omar Ravenhurst, one of the co-authors, died in Atlanta last year. He was every bit as mellow and cool as you might have thought, and his untimely passing is mourned by everyone who knew him.The crux of the book's phliosophy -- to the extent that Kerry and Greg set aside their satire and humor long enough to propound a philosophy -- is that creativity is the fundamental good; order v. chaos and statism v. anarchy are only secondary concerns. Reading the Principia changed my thinking forever."
1,JESUS is crying!,"Dear Mr. the Younger,Your book is a bile filled sack of nonsensical word diarrhea coated in putrid pus containing boils the likes of which have not been seen since SATAN first put his grubby mitts upon my leather bound BIBLE which then had to be burned. I would rather thrust a screwdriver through my retina than read another sentence, nay, word of your alleged text. I am 100% offended and I have contacted America Online (!) about having Discordianism stricken from the world wide internet! I hope that you have a good day and I encourage you to read this bible verse and absorb it's message so that this world may be less of a puke scented anal worm in the ear of all things delightful.Deuteronomy 23:1 , Deuteronomy 25:11-12 , Ezekiel 23:19-20 , 2 Kings 2:23-24GOOD DAY SIR."
1,This was NOT written by RAW!!!,"You all shall burn! This text is the most blasphemous drivel I have laid eyes upon! It encites our youth to disregard the sacred teachings of Jesus, and to fall in with a group of chaos-worshipping anarchists! Please, parents, keep this dangerous article of 'literature' away from your children. Worst of all, is that this material is not copyrighted! Your children's delicate sensibilities are made even more vulnerable, since any young pagan anarchist can, without legal repercussion, zerox the damn thing and distribute the evil propaganda!"
1,WHAT A WASTE OF PAPER! TRASH!,"I thought this would be entertaining, interesting atleast, but is it? Of course not! This is the stupidest book I have ever read and I hate it. There was nothing helpful, nothing on Chaos Magick, it's a bunch of inane chatter with about twenty words on each page with rediculous pictures. I HATE THIS BOOK!"
1,Like Eating Garbage,"If sarcastic blasphemy makes you giggle you'll like this book. The author's goal seems to be to mock God and all religions. He begins by firing God for ""gross incompotence"" and then sets forth his own faith, based on nihilism w/ a sarcastic sense of humor. The one star is for originality, otherwise no stars. Some of the more impressionable types won't get the joke and undoubtedly become devotees. Sadness. Better to read Galations 6:6-7 and Psalm 53:1-2, instead."
5,Great little cookbook,"After producing a bumper crop of heirloom pumpkins and squashes in my garden last year I looked around for something to make with them beyond the usual (though excellent) pumpkin pie and pumpkin bread. I found this little book and am so glad I did. It only has thirty recipes but all thirty look enticing. So far I have made the Pumpkin Gnocchi, Roasted Pumpkin With Other Vegetables, and the Pumpkin Soup. All proved to be very popular in our house. I'm getting ready to try the Baked Whole Stuffed Pumpkin this weekend and I expect it to also be a hit. I may even get around to trying the Pumpkin Pie!Heartily recommended for hearty fall fare."
4,"Dry, but informative","I'm not sure how attention grabbing org theory can be, but this book was very informative and understandable. The chapters are a nice size, and the summaries are useful."
2,Kinda cheap,I was a little disappointed when I got this product in the mail. It was meant to be a Christmas gift and the quality seemed a lot cheaper than expected. I'd choose a watch in person if possible.
1,Missleading picture,Don't be fooled by the picture of the wireless V100 mount in the picture. your buying a wired (not wireless) mount as I was fooled.
1,Worthless,Absolutely no improvement. I'm glad this item was no more expensive than it was. I guess I got what I paid for...
5,En dos palabras........IM - PRESIONANTE.,"One of the best books of this outstanding spanish author. Enjoy Barcelona and spanish way of life in the latest 19th century. Please be sure you take a look to another Mendoza's book, GURB a hilarious short story where an alien makes himself look like Marta Sanchez,8 the spanish Samantha Fox... in a way... )"
5,SUPERB PURCHASE....,"I have never been disappointed with ALL of my purchases from Amazon, affordable pricing for this championship DVD, a complete surprise, especially with the season just ending. Thank you for such good service and the expediency of shipping the products."
5,Go Lakers!,"This year is off to a rough start but with Kobe, Howard, Gasol, and Nash together don't count them out yet! P.S. coaching staff - we need a bench!!!"
5,KOBE...illest in the game!,This is a good one for any Lakers fan's collection. I scooped it as soon as it came out but found myself taking great comfort in its good vibes after that ridiculous sweep last season. And now with Phil gone this is a fond look back at yesteryear. Teams like this don't roll around every year. All the better that it's yet another triumph over the Leprechauns!!! I can only hope that the team can come together for one more good run while Kobe is still the best in the game!Recommended - especially as an antidote to a Lakers playoff loss.
2,Poor editing,"I love watching championship DVDs. Just finished watching SF Giants Championship 2010 DVD. It was excellent. This DVD is FAR from it. This dvd has footage of practice and locker room footage, but there is NO story. It just has some random interviews with random clips as B-roll. There is no drama. Game 7 starts and they just show a bunch of slow-mo shots and then they say that the Lakers won. I've seen homemade youtube highlights with better story telling. It is almost like they couldn't get broadcast footage of the real game so they had to use other cameras and practice footage.Also, the DVD is letterboxed and looks horrible on a widescreen TV.If you like the Lakers, then you'll probably enjoy watching your team shoot shot after shot with a lot of slow-mo. If you want to learn about their season and championship, then find a different video."
3,"Great team, Good, but not great DVD","While I am a HUGE Laker fan and I had a great time watching them this season (especially going to game 7), I found this DVD to be a good, but not great, re-cap to the season. I have no complaints about the main content, going through the season, the rounds of the playoffs and each game of the Finals, but I didn't like the extra features that were thrown in. They were very generic (Sounds of the NBA Playoffs) and not Laker-centric. I would figure that since this is the Lakers Championship DVD, all of the material would cover the Lakers. Unlike the 2008-2009 DVD, this one did not have ANY game recaps (hello...4th quarter of game 7 anyone?), no extras on the Laker members, coach Jackson, or Laker greats. It left me feeling a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the main content of this disc was great. But compared to the DVD from the Lakers-Orlando Finals of last year, I would figure they would've had so much more material to offer for a Lakers-Celtics Final."
2,Great Championship Year! DVD not so much...,"The content itself was good but most of the content that was in here was already showcased in ""The Association"" narrated by Andy Garcia with just the addition of the Lakers Parade and The Finals. I liked the narration by Andy Garcia much better than the DVD. Even the starting menu was low grade with the horrible background music. The quality of the video itself isn't even in HD and in these high tech times, that's horrible. I'm a big Lakers fan and this DVD fell short of my expectations."
2,Love the Lakers but ...... the DVD is disappointing,"The DVD is disappointing....sigh..... I expected so much moreThe best way to describe this is that it's an upgraded re-hash of the special ESPN did on the Lakers during the 09-10 season with some Playoff/Finals footage. One thing that really surprised me about it is that it doesn't have the NBA holographic seal that all NBA products come with these days.The picture quality is crap. If you have a HDTV it sits in a little box in the middle of your screen. Yes, I could have stretched it to fit the screen however I tend to watch things as they are (stretching the picture could decrease the quality).The only reason is gets 2 stars is because, well, it the LAKERS and they beat boston for the championship. Had it been any other team it would have received the 1 star it deserves."
5,Great title run!,This championship year wasn't as smooth as the year before it but that made it sweeter. Especially since they took revenge on both the Suns and Celtics! I'm going to watch this DVD a 100 times just to see the faces of the Celtics players as they walk of the court crushed after they made tons of promises they would win game 7.cheers!
3,Overjoyed but Underwhelmed,"As a Lakers fan who lives in Chicago, I don't get to see many Lakers games beyond the Playoffs. Thankfully, I recorded all the games, because this year's retrospective might be the weakest of all the Championship DVDs. The bonus features are a joke and barely have anything to do with the Lakers specifically. Still, the DVD does a good job of highlighting the arrival of Ron Artest and the importance of beating the Celtics. In all, this DVD seems rushed, but is still a must-have for any true Lakers fan."
2,Rush to production,Not much thought put into the video. Not as much video of the games and even less interviews with players and coaches.
3,"OK, but could have been better","As a long-time Laker fan, I know that any DVD on a successful season is worth watching, and so is this. But compared to the 08-09 DVD, this falls short. The 08-09 was more thorough, it contained highlights from a couple of top regular season games (CLE and BOS on Christmas Day), and even more fun, it had complete 4th quarters of a couple of key games. There were no such game videos on the the 09-10 DVD. If any 4th quarter was exciting, it was from game 7 against Boston. Shame on the producers for not including this. But, again, it wasn't bad, overall."
4,chanpions best?,it was a decent recollection of this past season... The extra features were generic and not centeredaround the team at all. The league is making the videos for the champions now. I think that it would be better if they give that responsibilty to the franchise. They would have a familiar voice that fans could relate to and they would have more detail on the journey because they took it with them. Decent video but I have the previous 4 and this the worst.
4,funny!,this is better than a lot of the newer simpsons episodes. it is a good fast read when you are bored.
5,Very convincing,"Lincoln looks like the Enlow pictured in the book. He bears no resemblance to Thomas Lincoln. This legend has been known as fact in that area for 200 years. And it was no secret Thomas and Abraham Lincoln did not ""get along""."
2,I wonder,"Quoted from one of the above reviews : ""Mike didn't know whether it was possible to shoot down an air-to-air missile with a gun, but he was going to try""The book looked interesting and I was about to order but when I read the above quote I had second thoughts. Of course it is impossible to shoot down an AA missile ... it's difficult to shoot down a large cruise missile that's going relatively slow like the Tomahawk, almost impossible to shoot down the supersonic cruise missiles launched by Russian ships or Backfire/Blackjack bombers, and we're expected to believe that he can shoot down a Mach 3+ circa 5 foot long missile whose rocket will have burnt out several miles from terminal intercept (therefore no flame or smoke visible) ... yeah sure! Now if his Harrier had been equipped with a laser then maybe."
1,"Super Amis, Trashy women, and Evil Arabs","Yes, this book contains all of the markings of the mash that is shoveled into the bookstore on a weekly basis. The heroes are square-jawed righteous 'mericans against those evil empire-building terrorist-supporting Arabs. The women are there to fall in love with the men, and most of them would be best buried in a Y-shaped coffin. No more original or believable than the World Weekly News."
4,"Fast-paced, technically believable, well-developed character","I enjoyed this book very much. It contained well-developed characters (one could relate to their emotions and situations), full action, and was technically believable. The book was well paced, meaning that as one reads and the action becomes more intense one tends to read more rapidly. It fulfills the appetite. Captain Boen may be the next Jake Grafton!"
3,good gum,Not as good as the steviadent but sense amazon didn't sell it anymore at the time I bought this. Its main sugar is Sorbitol. also contains Xylitol and maltitol. all sugar alcohols.
4,Fantastic,"Fantastic movie making - Hrithik and Ash are a powerful combination, the story is great and inspiring, the cinematography impressive. A historical at it's best."
4,Jodhaa Akbar,"Arrived on time, it was a gift for my daughter and she is very happy with the product especially the muisical score."
5,All time favorite! movie from Amazon!,"My husband and I watched this movie through Netflix and fell in love with it. We even tried to buy it from Netflix, but when they wouldn't sell it, I found it here, on Amazon.com and purchased it. The filming is outstanding, the message is uplifting and sweet, the actors are SO beautiful to look at and our all time favorite scene is at the royal wedding when the sufi's dance! We watch it again and again!Love it."
4,Blu-ray version is a keeper,Picture quality on the blu-ray version is excellent and it does have English sub-titles. Has menu for chapters and songs. Definitely recommended if you can find one!
5,Epic India,"While I've enjoyed some Indian movies, many of the ones I've watched in the past embodied some of the corniest of Bollywood, with the overly dramatic musicals and overacting. Jodhaa Akbar is a great exception. It's epic on the scale of Gladiator or Lawrence of Arabia. The movie follows the first years of the famous Mughal Emperor Akbar and particularly his relationship with his wife Jodhaa. The battles aren't really the focus of the movie but are pretty well done. More importantly, you get the sense that there is a real and budding relationship between Akbar and Jodhaa. The political intrigue is great, with brothers betraying each other and parents marrying their daughters off. My only complaint is that the sound quality (at least watching it on Netflix) didn't match its epic scope (hopefully the DVD is better in this regard). Overall, this is a definite for fans of epic history movies."
5,Wonderful epic romance!,"The movie Jodhaa Akbar rekindled my faith in why Hindi cinema is the greatest entertainer in the glimmering world of movie lights, for it could only be the Hindi film industry that could conceive such a monopolizing oeuvre.Hrithik Roshan as the Great Emperor Akbar is awe-inspiring. His performance is of dizzying heights, meticulously delivered without any room for criticism.Aishwarya Rai is always at her best when she is regal and in Jodhaa Akbar she is dignity personified.What a wonderful movie ! It is worth seeing!"
5,Great Item,This was a wonderful product. I received it within 2 days in perfect condition and had the options of subtitles which was important to me. The movie was great quality. I would suggest this product to anyone interested.
4,Very Enjoyable,"With Hritik and Aish as the lead couple, how could you go wrong? The film has spectacle, humor, romance, and a heart. The underlying theme of religious tolerance and mutual appreciation is most timely. And of course, the singing and dancing is a treat."
2,Good movie bad DVD,"The DVD has a couple places where it basically just stops playing. We've tried this on several DVD players, so it's definitely the DVD itself!It was disappointing."
1,This DVD is a FAKE!,"This DVD is a pirated version of the movie. We saw the movie in theaters and it is an AMAZING movie. We highly recommend everyone to see it in theaters or wait for the official DVD set to be released. This DVD is missing portions of the movie, the sub-titles are either wrong, make no sense, or are missing all together.Do yourself a favor, and wait until the official copy comes out. The sub-titles are so bad that in some scenes it completely changes the tone of the movie.Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai are wonderful in this movie. Seeing this movie is a MUST but not this version of it.We will be first in line to buy the official DVD when it releases."
1,illegal pirate DVD,This is an illegal pirate DVD that should not be on Amazon at all. The film just released and there is no legal DVD for many weeks.This product must be taken down from Amazon and the seller banned from the site!
1,atrociuos,"This is the most inept, amateurish epic movie it has ever been my doubtful priviledge to endure, although I only endured 10 minutes. The acting is appalling, the staging pathetic and as for the battle scenes, with thousands of extras, they were laughable. When you can witness scenes such as are achieved in say "" Kingdom of Heaven"" and see this travesty. I wonder that the producers dare inflict it on an unsuspecting public without some warning on the box. The extent of the violence seems to consist of a lot of fake limbs being lopped off and quantities of red paint being sprayed around. I have never really understood ""Boolywood"" movies and if this is an example, I never will.Even the costumes looked as if they were made of plastic armour and the cannon were a joke. Singing and dancing do not make up for an abysmal movie. A total waste of money. Caveate Emptor!"
5,Loved it,"One of the most enjoyable movies of recent times. The photography, acting, songs, dialogs and the epic scale are all outstanding. The casting deserves special mention."
2,Why Let Facts Get In The Way Of An Average Story?,"I like Hrithik Roshan, and I like Aishwarya Rai too. I didn't like this movie as much as either of them.Any Hrithik movie without him dancing *a lot* already gets a stroke against it - he's such a good dancer it's almost a crime to not stuff his crazy dance moves into every frame - and there wasn't enough Hrithik dancing here. I realise this is a serious movie, as Akbar is almost deified by some, but I was still disappointed.Hrithik also has a tendency to overact, although because this is a period piece it is almost appropriate that he does.Aish does her thing with pouty competence. Her outfits are truly glorious; she looks every inch the queen.The history is butchered, the acting is fine but not stellar, but I must admit it is nice to see this amount of money thrown at an Indian period piece. Visually, it dazzles. But that's about all it has going for it."
1,Aishwariya the worst actress ever!,Total disaster. Aishwariya doesnt know how to act and Hrithik over does it! They have messed up such an important story of the history. I wish they had casted people who knew how to act and carry on such important characters throughout the movie.
1,"HORRIBLE movie, painful to endure","I paid $13 to see this movie in a theater. Horrid waste of money, that.This is a truly TERRIBLE film, with horrible acting, nonexistent plot, and utterly lame music.Save yourself some misery, give this film a pass."
3,Jodha Akbar the movie,"Sharp images, but format not suitable for all TVs - some scenes tops of heads get chopped off."
1,NOT THE TEMPERANCE SEVEN !!,"Whoever this group are they are NOT the Temperance seven !!Although the titles are the same, I do not recognise any of the original line-up !!The tone, style and attitude of the original group elude this ""tribute""(?) band. In particular, this group are smugly aware of the musical jokes - THE TEMPERANCE SEVEN were unremittingly straight-faced, blissfully UNaware of their eccentricity. True eccentrics - this lot are posers.The vocalist here has nothing of the po-faced coolness of ""Whispering"" Paul McDowell.All in all this is a disappointment to those who remember those masters of harmony and cool AND IT SHOULD BE MADE CLEAR BY AMAZON THAT THIS IS NOT ORIGINAL MATERIAL!!"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!,Had the same problem most others had. No disc and disc not avialable everytime I tried a dvd. Piece of junk!!!!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"I just purchased this DVD player yesterday at CompUSA, during their going out of business sale. Out of the box the screen read ""no disc"" on both players. Terrible. It also feels lightweight and cheaply made. WOuld NOT recommend this to anyone."
2,"Good features, defective unit","This DVD player has very good features (DivX, dual screen), but unit which I got was defective (main LCD was dark and was blinking). Had to return."
3,Same issues but can be resolved,"I actually purchased this from a refurbished dealer and reading all the reviews the problem of disc error is common. Here is the problem that I have figured out. The player works fine when laying down and not in the car. When it is mounted in the car it struggles to get the disc moving in order to read it. What you need to do is first make sure the other monitor is not plugged in, then spin the disc with you finger and get it started before closing the lid. If at first you dont succedd try again. Plain and simple this player down not have enough power to get the disc started when it is in the position mounted in the car. If you can get a good deal on it it is definately a nice player but if not then get another player as this can be a headache."
1,Piece of Junk,"This DVD player is a piece of junk, don't waste your money, after 90 days NO ONE will help you. I purchased this for my vehicle to have when my granddaughter visited, so it was not used that often. The first one I purchased, the power cord came apart at the seam, well they replaced it, but with a single cord, had to send it back and get the dual cord. After I got the correct cord, the spring that holds the cover over the DVDs in the DVD player just popped. I called again, they replaced that unit. Well just a few months later (hasn't been a year yet) the second player popped its spring, and because it has been over 90 days from the first purchase they will not replace the unit. There is no 800 number for customer service, I have made lots of long distance phone calls for nothing."
4,Good value for this price,"For this price, you get 2 screens (one with DVD player).The DVD player can read almost everything except certain xvid formated files.They are very easy to install and remove so you can only take them for the long trips and keep them at home the rest of the time.The screens are quite robust for the moment (almost one year)."
3,considering.,"this album has it good moments [too late true love] and its downs [hard as hell]but seriously this is a mediocre album, start to finish.'when i die' is a complete rip off their earlier song 'girl I'm gonna miss you'this album is TOTALLY for die-hard fans.Check out Try N' B' for the same album with diff artwork and track listing, probably cheaper price as well.I really enjoy their debut All or Nothing, but this is total drab.the reason why this album dosnt completely suck was for the fact most of the music has decent hooks and melodies."
4,An overview of Beswick animal production,"This book presents a catalogue of the animal figures produced by the famous Beswick ceramic factory in Britain prior to being taken over by Royal Doulton. Fully illustrated, it also includes information about some of the artists who designed these attractive models, as well as details about the figures themselves, the dates when they were produced, and a price guide for each piece. A must for the serious collector or antique dealer, and a nice addition to your bookshelf for any animal lover."
2,very old story,"Recorded, translated, edited and annotated by African epic scholar Thomas Hale, who has, by the way, done extremely detailed work. ""The Epic of Askia Mohammed"" is recounted by a griot (the keeper of the spoken word)--a form of storytelling indigenous to Africa, unlike the novel, which is a European creation. A large part of the African epic poem is devoted to prayer. Another large part of the poem is recounting genealogies, as one of the griot's main jobs is linking people of the present to their past. Not a very exciting read (unless, of course, you found ""Beowulf"" exciting), but if you're interested in learning more about African epic poetry, this is definitely a good start."
1,Want to learn about jewelry design? Keep looking . . .,"If you are interested in learning about jewelry design, or seeing a comprehensive set of examples of a jeweler's most fabulous pieces, don't bother with this book. The subtitle ""Universe of Design"" is most misleading as regards this member of the set--I have not read the others, so I can't review them. The book is simply a puff piece about Van Cleef and Arpels: names various members of the family, discusses some ongoing motifs in design, and does a lot of name-dropping. The color illustrations are mostly copies of ad photos. Very skimpy for a ""universal"" book!"
2,you pay for what you get,Like the other review it deflated after a week of use. But for $30 what do you expect.
1,Don't - Loveseat,"This inflatable couch is not working for me. Within two days,two pin holes were on the seat of the couch and there is no repair kit. Sorry, but this is a poor item for $30.00."
5,Music for Lovers,Great CD - gift for a friend who thinks Joe Williams has the best voice in the business.
1,Small Block Chevy Engine Buidings,"I was very disappointed with this book. The cover shows a small block Chevy with a large Wiend blower sporting two 4500 series carburetors and the caption reads ""How to build horespower for maximum street and racing performance"". While there are plenty of respectable 350 builds for the street, only one is over 383 cid at 406 cid and only 513hp. Again, a heavy hitter on the street but not even coming close to the capabilities of the engine pictured on the cover or what the write up suggests. The one blown SBC they do build is a mild 470hp. There is a lot of good info in this book but the cover and write up is very misleading. Buyer beware."
3,Many magazine articles,"This book has one chapter on how to actually rebuild an engine. The rest of the book has different combinations of intakes, heads, carburetors, etc to see what makes more power. To me, it was like many magazine articles put together and sold as a book. The authors' math sucks. They are messing up the compression ratios of their engines so it is hard to keep track sometimes of where the performance is coming from."
2,Not all that good,"Seems like it was written 10+ years ago... not really what I was looking for at all. It is about putting together parts and how they ran. I wanted more specific how-to info not just we tried this and made more power... whoopee... I wanted real-world engine advice not just ""we gained 10 hp at 600000 RPM.Fail. Over priced for what it is."
4,"Well-made, but a bit too high for me","I purchased this yoga block to assist me with some of the seated poses. It's taller than other blocks, and I now realize that I should have chosen a standard sized block. I'm tall (5 feet 8 inches), and thought that this block made sense -- but I am also a beginner at yoga and have found the extra height of the block to be a problem. I'm back to using my Yellow Pages phone book, which is not as tall (and less rigid) for the seated poses. I do think this block is very well-made, but just not for me at this point in my work."
2,Least readable,"I love Reginald Hill, but this book was not very readable. It jumps back and forth, not very successfully, between WWI and the present day. If you are a history buff who is interested in WWI, you might enjoy this. I'm not, so I found myself skipping sections. Not my usual style when reading R. Hill. I usually savor every word. Not this time."
2,Dull and Lacks either humor or suspense,"This novel is very disappointing. Pascoe's invovlement with his forebears just doesn't make for even marginally compelling fiction. The environmental aspect is doubly disappointing because it reveals a political correctness, which we knew Hill felt close to his ""soul"", but had wisely jettisoned (except for Wieldy), and Hill tries to have his cake and eat it too. He presents environmentalism as a positive good, but also presents it in such a way that it comes across as absurd. Dalziel is depicted callowly (Was he in the novel?) NO way in world that FAt Andy would go for the girl Hill has chosen for her. Finally, the novel is shrouded in ""fog"" (miasma) I realize Hill was aiming for something special, but for this reader he missed wildly."
5,Vick's Pelleas and Melisande,"Many years ago I listened to Pelleas Melisande on CD, and almost fell to sleep. But I liked Graham Vick's directing(Lulu), and tried this DVD, trusting his mastery. The result was satisfactory. First of all casting was excellent. Richard Croft and John Tomlinson played their roles earnestly and passionately, Christiane Oelze was very beautiful and subtle. Though for singing I prefered Maria Ewing's, her singing was also remarkable. I however liked the stage most of all. The romantic but authentic set seemed to represent the rigid atmosphere of Arkel & Golaud, and the pressure Pelleas, Melisande & Ynold might suffer. I feel his stage directing is not too conventional, not too modern, but visually delicate."
4,Great Cake Pans,"Tihs is a great set of pans for any cake baker. They are deeper, which makes baking a bit tricky. It's important to consult the Wilton website for correct baking times."
4,Cake Pans,"wish it would have come iwth the small tube for the larger cake pan, most do include it. The pans were in good shape and I have baked several cakes already. Shipped in plenty of time, packaged well, good experience."
2,not that good except the name,it is from national geographic but does not mean it is better than others except it costs twice more. i think the one you bought at walmat is good as this one if you are looking the direction. the info about parks could be much more. the center sprial binding makes hard for reading continusly.
2,"Good when it came out, but out of date now","Unbelievable that National Geographic, the perennial standard-bearer of mapping and geographic exploration, hasn't published an updated version of this atlas. It was good in its time, but it's out of date now almost 10 years later. Come on, NG! Put out a new US Atlas!"
4,A Quality Well Done Atlas....Again,"Just as good as the first edition. Most all states are in fact on two pages, so the maps are larger. This edition comes with a protective front and back page that hopefully will keep the atlas looking good and flat till the next new edition comes out. Great Product!"
2,"It's a road atlas, but that's about it...","I bought this as a gift for my mom and ended up returning it. I was excited about how it said it had points of interest across the fifty states, and thought my parents could keep it in their car and use on road trips. When it came I saw that it is HUGE and really would not be practical to keep in the car, and it's really just a typical road atlas with disappointingly few points of interest. I would not recommend this product."
1,not what i wanted,i was not happy with this it does not break down the areas that i need to look at closer i have always gone with altas and i will go back to them
5,Great Road Atlas,"Really, really nice road atlas; spiral bound, hard, plastic protective covers, etc. It was exactly what I wanted. Execellent on showing where all Nat parks, state parks, etc are. Note - Do not buy this as a guide to these parks as it is not a trip planner. Look elsewhere for these. Overall, I am very pleased."
5,Road Atlas,Great for planning trips. Sit by the computer or have the Kindle right there; that way places suggested on the map can be researched at the same time.
4,Great tool for planning a road trip,"We bought this as a tool to plan an extensive x-country road trip, and it is very helpful for this purpose. As an earlier reviewer said, it is essentially a nation-wide (and some of Canada) road atlas with a section listing selected national parks, and another listing by geographic region of adventure activities in those regions.As an atlas, it is on par with any other road atlas I have used. The park listings are moderately helpful, but what is especially useful is the spiral binding and heavy-weight plastic cover, which set it head and shoulders above other national atlases."
2,"Exceeds the bounds of acceptable, employable behavior.","Harold S. Long's book on collections called HOW TO COLLECTILLEGAL DEBTS, although very useful, funny, realisticand psychologically, very interesting and stimulating,exceeds the bounds of acceptable, employable behavior.The advantage of a more mainstream approach, is you're employableas a professional by other companies, whereas Harold S. Long'stechniques would require you to open up your own business,with a great deal of muscle-man, karate or boxing trainingto go with the collections activities.I used a big coupon to and free shipping to buy this title,so I am happy about the value for my money. However, beyonda certain point, the sales price could exceed the benefitsmost people will reap from the book.I would recommend Timothy Paulsen's PAID IN FULL book,for example, as a parallel reference."
1,Evil and Immoral Book Teaches Violent Loan Sharking,"Amazon:I gave it one star because the form forced me to, it deserves none and the author should be arrested.I am an attorney who has specialized in the collection of past due accounts for twenty five years.As such I am always looking over books on the subject.My wife, who is employed by my office, just bought from you ""How to Collect Illegal Debts."" by Harold Long, listed by you: How to Collect Illegal Debts by Harold S. LongPaperback (June 1990) Loompanics Unlimited; ISBN: 1559500417I was shocked by what I read. It is a training manual for violent loan sharks. It may or may not be illegal of you to sell it, but it is clearly immoral and bad for Amazon's image. You probably have not looked at the text. You should also be shocked, otherwise you are so hardened as to be beyond help. Please withdraw this truly evil book from circulation."

4,Crafts for all Occasions,"The Jewish Holiday Craft book is a great tool for both parents and teachers. Filled with lots of craft ideas for all major Jewish holidays, this book is also nicely illustrated with step by step instructions and a detailed list of what you will need for each project. Each holiday section begins with a brief description of the holiday and related traditions.Although the book is geared towards younger children, a variety of crafts are presented - some for pre-schoolers, but some definately for older elementary school-age students. Additionally, some of the crafts may give you your own ideas to make them more age appropriate. The napkin covered vase project for Shabbat is appropriate for younger grades. It inspired me to create a decoupage vase craft for older children.I would recommend this book for Jewish religious school teachers for elementary grades and families with young (up to middle school) children. A nice addition to your personal or school library!"
5,Great craft ideas,Got this book to get craft ideas for my class. It has been very useful. Imwouldmrecommend for teachers and parents
1,Crude map drawing of Italy in the center of the flag,The flag was not as shown in the picture. I was delivered a flag with a map of Italy and its territories in the white portion of the flag.
3,Serves the Purpose,"What can you expect for a cheap price? I needed this for a school presentation, so price was important. While this satisfies presentation needs, the quality is not worth keeping for any future needs."
5,Great product... interesting packaging,"The product is exactly as described and works great. What is odd is the amount of packaging. The other reviewers are not kidding. These two tiny pieces were packaged in a box that was 12-inches square and 4 inches high with lots of paper in it to protect them! The whole package ended up weighing 1 pound! They really could be sent in a buble wrap envelope and be just fine. I'm guessing they lose money on these items since I spent $2.64, since I'm a member of Amazon Prime I didn't have to pay for shipping.... so there is no way they made money. So if you want an eco friendly package, don't order these! =)"
5,Fast service,"Quality was great, service was fast. Amazon wants twenty words on their reviews. So the rest of this is filler. What more can one say than great quality and fast service, especially when your talking about ear pieces. O yea the shade of gray went well with the color of my eyes. :-)"
3,Plantonics Ear Cushions,The Ear Cushion for my Sony Headphones were a bit too small. Often I would tear them apart putting them on.Is there Ear Cushions that are just a little bit bigger?
4,Perfect fit for my Sony workout headphones,For years I've been replacing my headsets when just the cushions wore out. I never could find replacement cushions. My only complaint is they are made from a stiffer foam than the soft pliable foam that the original was made from. Technology Galaxy was a fine company to deal with. My order came to me promptly.
1,For earbuds not headset,"The photo and description of this product do not match what I received from WowParts. I can't speak for what you might get from other sellers, but I did not receive: ""Product Description - Ear Cushion 2Pack- Plantronics replacement ear cushions- Includes 2 foam ear cushions- 2 Inches round- BlackPL1572905""The cushions are a little over half an inch in diameter. The opening is about 1/8-1/4 inch in diameter. They fit on my earbuds, which I didn't really need them for but since now I've got them it is easier to use them for that purpose than to bother returning them. I would only buy these if you don't mind wasting the $3 and a week (waiting for these to arrive, then ordering what you really needed and waiting for it to arrive). Thankfully I found this item4 Pairs COSMOS Quality Replacement 2"" (50mm) Foam Pad Earpad Cover Cushion for Sennheiser PX100 Sony MDR-G57 Headphones + cosmos cable tiewhich is in fact 2"" in diameter and fits a Plantronics headset."
2,they shipped these in their own box?,I can't believe they shipped these in their own box charging me several dollars when they could have shipped them first class in an envelope for 41 cents. What the heck were they thinking. I'm rating them bad for that. Otherwise they're fine. I'll come back to review again after however many years it takes for the sponge material to break down.
1,can't even describe it...,"This is one of the crappiest products I ever bought online.These foams not only will not fit the headphone (and obviously they will fall and you'll lose at lease one of them, making it impossible to return...), but are very thin and fragile.I would return if I haven't lost them...I'm amazed that people not only manufacture these things but even sell them."
4,Great sound,I replaced my stock muffler with this bullet on my 06 Nissan Titan and it makes the truck sound great. There is no drone. I didnt really see any change in performance but the sound is sweet.
4,Drone Killer,"This DynoMax Bullet muffler is the finishing piece to my exhaust system. The car is an Acura Integra with the V-Tec engine. After buying this used car something had to be done about the exhaust, it had one of those shiney ""Can"" mufflers. I had new 2.25"" pipe and a DynoMax SuperTurbo muffler installed. It was quieter, but still had a drone noise in the cabin. To get rid of this headache I had the resonator, DynoMax 24234, installed. It still sounds pretty sporty, most of the noise is gone. This type of a system should allow a good flow, maximizing torque and horsepower. The car will be raced in National level autocross."
3,Step by Step starter,"This painting book would be more aptly described as a tutorial on painting different subject matter. IN other words, style is not really considered, but rather this book is a step by step guide on how to put the paint on the canvas effectively. If you want to read about differing styles I would recommend Galton's Oil Painting encyclopedia. This book in contrast, has step by step techniques for painting flowers, portraits, land and seascapes. I found the portraits to be very helpful in their color recommendations and starter ideas. Nevertheless, I was looking for a better-rounded book that covers style as well as technique. If you are new to painting and have no idea where to start, this book might be for you - if you are looking for inspiration on differing styles than try Galton's book."
5,skate,I love this man and his music. I tried to pattern my piano playing to his compositions - never came close.I was in my teens when Earl hit the big time and to this day his power just comes through to me andI feel the pain of sweet days gone by and never to be known again.
3,"So far so good, but...","I have had this card for a few days. The software was easy to install and so far it has worked great. However, I am disappointed that the package did not include a protective case for the card. My old Linksys card had such a case. How are we supposed to protect the card when it isn't in the laptop?"
1,Does not work.,"I've done all the things everybody else has done. I've done the support thing, I've done the experiment thing, I've done the newsgroups thing. Nothing has helped me to get this to work. I cannot connect to the related 108g Netgear router (the same brand even!). I'm afraid I am going to either send this thing back in or buy another brand. It's useless to me. It's just a chunk of metal and plastic sticking out of my laptop. It doesn't do anything except blink its lights at me. I give up.[Update: Turns out my laptop wasn't powerful enough to use this PC Card. Probably needs more power going to it.]"
2,Crashed and burned,"This card caused many problems on my 1yr old laptop. My laptop would freeze completely several times a day. The card also caused windows XP to generate the blue screen of death during normal network activity. the problems were intermittent. sometimes it would run OK for a few hours, but I never got 10X faster than my old '11b stuff. So, I returned it along with the 108mbps router. good riddance."
1,Good luck with tech support...,"Used the product for about a week and it worked fine...until the day that it crashed my laptop. After that it was never to work again. When i called tech support, i was told that until i register online, i cannot get support. I inquired how could I possibly register online if I cannot get online. After registering the next day from my office computer, I called 3 times and got 3 different support people. None spoke english well, none had any idea what was wrong, 1 hung up in frustration, the other told me to reboot hang up and call back, and the other simply said im sorry, im sorry, im sorry. I was forced to return the product."
1,Beware,"I installed this on a newly purchased laptop. This became very very ""HOT"" and basically burned up my laptops cpu. I am now in hand of a non-working newly purchased laptop uncovered by any warranty.Beware!!"
5,Netgear WG511T Super G 108 Mbps Wireless PC Card,I got my card on Oct 5. It installed without a problem. It is so good that i was able to pick up my friends wireless network and he is a block away. I was very surprised. I would reccommend this card to everyone.
4,Workin Fine,"I use this card with my Linksys super G router and it all seems to work very fast with OK range.As always with new computer hardware or software, download and install the latest drivers. This one came with a wireless network manager and the updated version was MUCH better than the version that came with it.I did have some problems with setting up the router, but once I set up the wireless router to be behind my old wired router (instead of replacing it) I have had no network problems with the wired PCs, wireless laptop, or Wii! Thank goodness for effective standards organizations!This is a realiable device and I am pleased with it."
5,Terrific card in my old A20m,"I'm a D-Link refugee and this card has been just great. My home connection has been very good, I'm in a basement and have no idea where the router is!Swapping wireless networks is a breeze as I travel around - it can be easily configured to automatically find one wherever you are.Very reliable, quality construction, easy to install and no problems with W2K.This is my 2nd Netgear card; also have the FA511 wired adapter about which I can say the same things (except the wireless bits).Definitely recommended and worth the extra cost if there is any.** a late addition. My laptop battery gets drained very quickly as of late. It's older so maybe it's best before date has been passed or maybe it's because this network card sucks the juice out of it. Wouldn't surprise me. There are configuration settings though in the card s/w to reduce the transmit power of the card which may reduce the battery drain."
3,Taxes the Computer,"This card really taxes the computer in 802.11G and 802.11G - 108Mbps mode. The mouse intermittently freezes as the network access happens. Is the card using a software driver? I don't know. The only thing that helps this problem is using it only for 802.11B. The range is OK, depending upon position relative to router."
4,Works great - New Driver fixed the XP blue screens,"I gave this product only 4 stars because it took a while for the manufacturer to get me a driver that doesn't crash. Now that I have a decent driver I love this card.I replaced some older wireless gear with the NetGear 108 super G stuff. The super G stuff is great. The range is better than my old 802.11 gear and the speed is awesome. My wireless router is in the basement and one of my computers is 2 floors up and I still get good speeds.If you have one of these cards, just go to the manufacturer's web site and get the most recent driver. They have fixed the blue screen problem and now this card works great."
5,works great!!!,"Very easy to install. Very easy to manage. I use this with my Super G wifi router. We live in s small place so I'm not so sure about the range, but for me it works great."
1,turns my new laptop to sludge,"from the moment this was plugged in it slowed my new laptop to an all but grinding halt....I dearly wanted it to work, have tried everything....But it is going back"
4,My mistakeI,"I don't think I needed this purchase. I was trying to trouble shoot my laptop on my own and I thought the original PC card was bad, turns out that wasn't the problem. In any case, delivery was prompt and efficient and I got the product as ordered. Can't ask for much more than that."
4,Wireless Card,The card works fine in Window XP but you have to pop the card in and out every time you power up the laptop. I didn't have to do that with the old card...
1,"Poor quality, Poor support, a bad experience--stay away","I have a4 computer network in my office, assembled by an IT team I payed over $10,000.00 in consulting fees to organize. I need equipment that works. I have no time to be fiddling with a toy. This card has been a disaster. From the moment it was installed, it started blue screening with stop errors related to the drivers. Calls to support did not help. Even Netgear doesnt know why this card doesn't work . I have downloaded new drivers, Quadrupled the RAM to 2 Gigs, and hired a network technician to fix it. It routinely causes a stop error, and all data is lost. This slows down my business. Do yourself a favor and dont buy this."
4,"Historia clásica, música mejor","Película con una historia como muchas otras de clase romántica en el cine, pero destaca la banda sonora y la fotografía. Las actuaciones a veces resultan algo sobreactuadas, sin desmerecer que se mantiene un ritmo atractivo de las relaciones entre los protagonistas y de la trama en su generalidad."
3,it is actually brass and does not look much like the photo,"It is quite a nice watch, but it is brass and therefore much browner than the photo shows. For the money it is good value and looks nice."
4,Fun read for adult and kids alike!,"My roomate's 8th grade son picked out this book from the local library, originally for his little sister in second grade. But when I started reading, I couldn't put it down.I found this book a very fun read. When I was reading, I was laughing all the time, The humor is alot like in the hitchhiker's guide, the 3 main characters reminded me the 3 muskerteers in Harry Potter, especially Honoria with Hormeone. I hope the author will do a series of book base on these 3 lively characters :)Kids into science, law or Japanese culture should find lots they can related with.Since I live in Austin, Hail! another wonderful Austin writer (if Greg do identify himself with Austin, Ha!)!"
4,Friendships change for better or worse.,"The characters being only friends. That's the way it started it out. For Shohei, Honoria and Elias, their lives would soon forever change. A simple science fair, supposed to be a fun little event, starts to twist their lives into unexpected ways. The book was almost had absolutely no boring parts. The adults in the book were a phenomenal part of the raging plot. This book had all the exciting parts down to the dot of action. The parts of sorrow were as bitter as bitter could get. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves an unsuspecting turn of events at the moment of truth."
4,"Fun, Light-hearted Read","(...) I finished this book in one sitting and it was one of those rare books where the story was actually as amusing as the title. While at times some of the characters and scenarios are too extreme, to me, that's half the charm of the book. So if you're looking for a funny, light-hearted quick read, then ""Ninjas, Piranhas, and Galileo"" might be what you're looking for. In short, humorous characters (Shohei is one of the best characters I've come across in a long time!), original setting, and unique plot make this first book by Greg Leitich Smith a keeper."
2,Its OK,"Rented it from Block Buster for the weekend. I was pretty excited reading all the great reviews about it!Never captured interest too much...an inline skating game where you can tag inanimate objects and people. Player versus player mode is not exciting at all. As an example, the ""ball"" game is where the player who picks up the ball and finishes an entire lap around the course wins. Except on most stages, unless the player who got the ball makes a tremendous mistake, they'll win the mini-game each time."
1,Jet Set Radio Future,"This is such a waste of money and I didn't pay for it. It came free with the bundle and I turned it off and never will play it again. The music is the worst and you cannot turn down the volume. It isn't even music, just a simple loop that goes on and on. The graphics are very poor looking like what I have seen on my sega. Very boring for an adult."
1,My sister is obsessed with this game!,"There is no point to this game. All that happens is you skate around,do grafetti and things happen. It is so pointless no wonder it was free with the xbox! It is so Toyko-atized. No affence to people in Toyoko. The grapics are so stupid. My 10 yr old sister is so obseesed with this game that she came out in a towel just to see if we had beat it yet. This game will rot your brain. Burn it and cover it with meleted jet set games. DO NOT PLAY!!!"
5,Forget the peeps with one star...,"This game was a perfect open world game for my age during that time! I have tons of fun with it and the challenges were a bit of a pain but its worth it in the end. But easily I can say the Jet Set Radio original had the better music but then again they were both good except in future it was more repetitive. This game shows how great does it feel to have freedom (yes although you need to complete areas to unlock others but still) because there are less police than in the first one (I love how its different and all to the sequel however its a pain at times to unlock characters) and no timer! It was much easier yes, but I had so much fun with this game and I feel like they should remake this because I know they would sell well with Jet Set Radio for 360, PS3, and PC. This game would be good if you have no other games to play."
5,JSRF,"very happy on how fast the game shipped!!! i knew i was buying a used gamed but i thought i was getting the game in its original box like shown in the pic...instead i got the game in a clear cd case...heres the bright side i didnt get a box but the game was a double feature game which brought (JSRF,and sega gt 2000)so i was happy to get 2 games for the price of one..this is a classic and must have for any video game fan..."
4,Addicting,"Graphics and story may not be that good, but the gameplay itself will keep you playing the game through the end. Lots of fun missions and events in the game along with really good maps to explore and skate through."
2,Stupid GAME!,"I've owned this game for the last few weeks and have come to the conclusion that it is a terrible waste of money. The entire point of the game is to do graffiti. The levels are extremely easy and the handling of the characters is sickening. One of the big things in the game that you are supposed to do is rollerblade and grind on rails and jumps. This part is fine except when you want to stop. Many times it will take multiple minutes before you can stop grinding or you have to completely stop what you are trying to do and jump off in the wrong direction, which gets very irritating. Also numerous times when you try to turn around, your person will begin grinding and is virtually uncontrollable. In conclusion I wouldn't buy it unless it came with the Xbox(which in somecases it does along with a good game, Sega GT 2002)."
3,Just a Relax Game with a Great Title!!!,"This game was acquired by me when I bought a Xbox Bundle System, and it came with it. So, the title game promess a lot of fun, but it just that,, a promess...If you want to spend the time with this game, go aahead its your time that if going to be waste...The graphics are not good sharp... there are more games with better graphic.By the way, the game is hard to play because there is always an annoying music that with the time bother the time that U spend with the game.The game is a 3 star game."
5,This game rules.,"The cell shading is what makes this game like candy for the eyes. The story plot is not to be taken serious, but it is a pretty nice plot of young juvenile delinquents restoring the streets back to it's citizens by overthrowing a corrupt corporation that has taken over Tokyo's government. The thing I like most about this game is that you can spray paint cops and also the neat things that you can grind on through each of the levels. I haven't beat it yet, but I'm not in any hurry because I want my Jet Set experience to last. Buy this game now if you own a Xbox. Yea, I know that's what a lot of review sites say, but this is hands-down one of the best Xbox games based on the graphics and all-around fun factor. If you're a gamer that likes to play a game where you get sucked into it and play for hours, this is one of those kinds of games. Peace."
1,Total waste of time,"I can't even begin to explain how awful this game is. The music is annoying and terrible, and the gameplay is bad. This isn't a game, you just go around and spraypaiint stuff while they play terrible music. I got this game free with my x-box, eventhough i didn't pay for it i still think i got ripped off. So if you are over the age of 8, don't buy this game."
1,HOrrrrrrrrrrrrriibbbbllleeee,This game isn't even a game.You just go around grinding for 99% of it. Plus the music...Ahhhhh.... It isn't even music. It just makes these weird sounds the whole game except for one where there constantly swearing.If i were you i would actually by a game.
1,buy tony hawk this is the worst game ever,this game was a disgrace to skating games the special effects were pathetic. the music was annoying and it was a complete bore.
3,Too much like Dreamcast version.,"Jet Set Radio Future is exactly like Jet Grind Radio for the Dreamcast with a new city, some new characters, and new paint. This game gets boring fast if you loved the on for Dreamcast..."
2,"Uh, Wassiss?",This game came fee with my Xbox. Now I know why. I guess you get what you pay for. I tried playing the game a couple of timesand while the controls are easy to pick up and responsive the game is atually quite shallow. The levels are large and detailed but the the gameplay is monotonous. Definitely aimed at a younger audience. More sophisticated gamers will easily get bored due to the lack of challenge. I still can't figure out why this game is rated so highly.
3,Am I the only one who is having problems?,I got this game and I thought that it was a lot of fun until I hit a snag. My game locks up when you meet up with Combo. So I took the game back and got a replacement thinking that it might be a glitch in the software. Well I got a new one and tried it out to find that it had the same problem!! I loved this game and I would like to be able to play it for longer than 15 minutes.
2,"It's not about quantity, it's quality!","Let's say that your teacher/boss tells you to write a whole story about your life in 5 minutes. He/she says that you will get 5 bucks if your story was written in the time limit, and you will get 4 bucks if it was written over the time limit.SO, you of course, would like to get the larger amount of money. So you rush and hurry on your story and just barely make it in the time limit. You hand it back to your teacher/boss, and they give you the money. But you didn't get 5 bucks, you got 1! Your boss/ teacher now tells you why you got only 1 buck. "" You need quality, not quantity"" they say. Now pretend you are the makers of Jet Set Radio Future. How much profit would you get in a game that was worth 1 buck instead of 4 bucks? Barely any!Although the game was kind of junky, I do have to say that there was some action in it but I would not recommend it for ages 8 and under..."
4,cool xxxx,I do not think the xbox is no were nere the Ps2s level yet. thePS2 plays much more then the xbox. the xbox is the most biggestgame system I have ever seen in my life. thats why I think the xbox is for alot of kids but the ps2 is for adults and teens. Ido not think A ps2 would last that long with kids because I haveone my self and I no all about them.
5,BEST XBOX GAME EVER!!![.],"this game is really fun. it takes place about 21 years in the future, and you skate around and do graffiti. this game has really good music, and you can make your own graffiti, it's also a VERY VERY VERY GOOD challenge. my friend hasn't beaten it and he's the master of video games...well almost...lol"
4,Awesome Sega Action on your X-Box,"Jet Set Radio Future is a huge improvement over the original Dreamcast game in every respect possible. Graphically, JSRF uses the Xbox's graphical power to the max creating huge environments and and detailed cel shades graphics. Controls are perfect and the adventure aspect of the gameplay is unique and challenging. Highly recommended."
3,"Sweet Sub/Mission,Volume 1 - various artists(Fifth Colvmn)","This CD really surprized me!I wanted to rate it 3 1/2 stars.Six different artists from the Italian label Sub/Mission doing two songs each.I was quite impressed with the cuts by Swamp Terrorists ""Drive-Right Jab"" and ""Rebel Shade"".Some might refer to this as retro music.Other cool material includes Templebeat's ""You Spin Me Around"" and ""F***ing Mosquito"" as well as L.I.N. doing ""Jessica's Crime"".Worth checking out."
2,"A choppy, poorly thought out tale","The author seems to have many ideas and likes to throw each one out - zombie pirates, a navy of sea-going insects - but doesn't make any of them work. Great time is spent on a diving expedition which yeilds a magical harp. About half the book leads up to this find. Then the harp plays only a small role in a confusing, overblown sea battle that ends in a stalemate. The author shrugs off the fact that you've read 300 pages only for Conan to end up right back where he started. Such is life."
2,poor sequel to the red brotherhood,"Essentially a sequel to Conan and the Red Brotherhood, this novel does absolutely nothing to enhance the Conan mythos. Although Carpenter is quite adept when discussing Conan's voyages on the Vilayet, his weaknesses in the plot department are all too apparent. Conan seems to become involved in strange situations with nary an explanation only to extricate himself with little effort. Read this one only if you must!"
5,Great read,The book was in o.k. condition but the subject matter and the way it was written knocked me out. I had met Al Brodax once and we talked a bit about YS. This book shows how he guided the project from concept to premier. A great read. And it arrived quickly.
3,"Singing was so so and should have been left out, piano music was great","Having heard Dachman's music from my sister-in-law who is one of his patients, I ended up searching for his other albums and ran across these on Amazon. The piano music is great but I didn't care for the vocal portion on this album. So I gave it to my sister-in-law and kept the other one. The other album I enjoyed and listened to many times.""GREAT MUSICIAN"""
3,Cuts EVERYTHING Great!,"There is no better tool than this mandoline when you have to do bulk slicing/waffling/julienne-ing of any veggie...or finger! The worst part about it is its VERY dangerous shuttle/food holder. The infinitely-adjustable blade can go from cutting potatoes thinly enough to make home-made potato chips (just fry them 20 or 30 seconds in oil, drain, sprinkle them with salt, and YUM!), to about 3/4"". ""Infinitely adjustable"" means there are no ""detents"" when adjusting the degree of thickness--you turn a thumbscrew to the thickness you like and leave it at that. JUST BE CAREFUL! If the food shuttle were MUCH better, this would be 5 star mandoline. As many times as I've taken a very good chunk of skin off a thumb (needing stitches once...), though, the rating has to be just 3. It is VERY sharp and stays sharp. You never even know what's happened until it's too late. A few words of advice if you buy this mandoline: Buy a BETTER shuttle for it!"
2,Disappointed,"I ordered the Matfer stainless steel mandoline elsewhere. It is 215000 (looks and works exactly same as the 215001). I love it's design. It is so study and simple. The straight blade works great (and hopefully I will be able to sharpen it when necessary). But the julienne blades and waffle blade are worthless. None are sharp enough to cut anything, just chew it up with much force, that would lead to dangerous accidents. Hoping I just got a lemon and most are much better. Because I really love this thing - if it would just work properly."
2,No safety holder!!,"My husband gave me this mandoline for Christmas, I was very excited, until I opened it and realized it didn't have the safety holder for holding whatever you are cutting (the one all the other reviews warn you not to skip using.) I sent it back and ordered a replacement - and got another one with no safety holder! I am really disappointed."
1,Vendor Extremely Unreliable,I have tried for a month to cancel this order. The vendor refuses to respond to my e-mails (3). The vendor refuses to explain the status of my order. I will never buy from Arlington Gate Closeout or Amazon. Amazon has been no help in assisting me in this situation.
4,$79.99 one-day sale price for the commercial version,"""Packed expressly for Williams-Sonoma"" WS now only sells an OXO brand for $70 and a De Buyer Deluxe for $160. I love that Amazon does the scavenging for me.Made in France""18/10""""dishwasher safe""The product has sodder marks and is a very commercial looking product in that there are no frills or any prettying in the design. There is a video for the consumer version on the matferbourgeatusa website. It's simple and straightforward to put together and use but the video is nice to watch anyway. ""Voila!"" hee, hee, hee."
2,All Talk and No Action,"That really says it all ""All Talk & No Action"". Very disappointing. I thought this would be at least ""soft porn""-dull."
1,Mind game,"This movie is one never ending mind game. Low budget production... do not waste your time, money or energy on this one."
1,Not verry good flim,"I found this movie about sex to be lacking in really any sex. It moved slow and seemed like the actors were more performing on stage than in a movie. They were eloquent speakers, but that was about it. I would choose something else if I knew it was going to be fairly boring and very low budget."
2,Its ok,Not a skin flick. There's some lingerie but no nudity. Great looking lingerie. The lead lady looks pretty good in here outfits.
4,Great Dishes for a Great Deal,"I haven't had a chance to use these yet, but this was a great deal. The dishes are beautiful. I am excited for the holidays to come around again!"
3,Sturdy item,"This is a very high quality product, and I'm happy with it almost a year later, but I made the mistake of trying to apply it myself in cold weather without a garage to warm up the bumpers.I finally took it to my auto body guy and paid him to use a heat gun and make it stay (the ends kept pulling away where the guard bent around a corner).I'm guessing it would install fine in warm weather..."
5,my 2 year old son loves this,"he repeated chooses this book for me to read to him. he can't recite them yet, but he can finish the last word of each rhyming stanza. he laughs at the pictures."
1,Is this a german history book?,"I wasted too much money to buy this book. I recommend you not to buy this book. Some of problems in this book are about German History or German Geology.............. For example, a question was about 30 years war--and the answer was ""Westfalen"" I want to SUE this company."
1,Sprechen Sie Deutsch?,"Because these people don't. Rather than being a comphrehensive review book, this book is a compilation of practice tests (which, accompanied by explanation, might not be so terrible) that serves little help in preparation for the exam. Not to mention, this book is clasically ""shady""--the CD that comes with it is HOMEMADE, the font isn't uniform, and the binding is questionable.This book neither helps you preper nor helps ease your worries. It is terrible, and I wouldn't suggest supporting the family who probably makes it."
1,Beware- DO NOT buy this book,"this HOME MADE book is full with mistakes and errors, it has a few pages slapped on at the end (from an ancient dictionary) to make it look substantial. WORST OF ALL the CD that came with it, was BLANK... I have NEVER been so shocked that someone would have the nerve to sell this as a legitimate book."
1,a hodgepodge of multiple choice questions,"This book contains a hodgepodge of multiple choice questions, in no particular logical sequence, which are unrelated to the AP German exam."
4,good study guide,"This study guide was very helpful, particularly the audio CD that came with the book."
4,Opener12,Works well and was very easy to install. Was happy to find a door opener that was compatible with my garage door system.
5,Perfect,Needed to replace a shorted control pad & this worked great. Exact replacement was very easy to install & took minutes!
5,Just as expected and easy to install,I like this a lot better than the old single door bell looking unit. I also like the fact that I can now control the lights without having to open the door.
2,Wall console,I guess I have a genie that requires the ability to hook it up with four wires. This one didn't work so I had to send it back.
4,Good Product,Easy to install and it works perfectly. The only flaw I've noticed is that the backlight on the larger button only seems to light half of the button (the only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars). Not a major issue since the backlight still shows both buttons in a dark garage.
5,Perfect Transaction,Product and delivery was exactly as stated. Good communication. As a matter of fact I am going to buy another one. Well done!
5,"Yea, now I can leave!","Arrived quickly, installed easily, works perfectly. I have an Overhead Door Company opener so I checked first to make sure that this would work and it does!"
1,Does not work,"This does NOT work with non-intellecode openers, you have been warned. The ad said works with intellecode and non-intellecode in one place and intellecode only in another place. The owners manual lists this model as the correct one. I called Genie and they said they do not support non-intellecode models anymore. I thought I would take a chance, since I have not found this item in a store.I guess I am out $16 since shipping and restocking fees are more than I paid."
2,Not quite right,"this item only has 2 screws which only operated the light on my door openerdid not activate garage door openerI needed 4 screws in back2 for door, 2 for light"
1,Did Not Work,"Don't buy from these people! Their descriptions are misleading and the return policy sucks, so I just wound up throwing a $20 bill in the garbage.It was a cheaply made POC, anyway."
1,junk,"yes it's small, it's light...butthe cup is cheap, the ""pot"" is not deep enough, i would fear trying to pour boiling water out of it.the frying pan handle doesn't lock so the pan swings around when you try to dump food out of it. the whole thing doesn't lock closed and rattles like a junkmans cart..the plate works."
2,Mess kiot,"Product is mush smaller than the picture shows, I'll be returning this hopefully find some that are larger. If you're cooking for one it would probably work out."
3,"Decent, but not all teflon-coated","I may not have read the description carefully enough. So, bear in mind:ONLY 1 of pans has a nonstick coating.I still haven't been able to get my eggs unstuck from the others. Other than that, good cookware for the price."
3,"Doesn't close up well, could use a carry bag","I was hoping that this product would close up tightly so that I could simply carry it in a pack with other items and not need an additional carry bag. Unfortunately it does not close particularly well. The pans are much lighter than I had expected and I'm not certain that it will hold up well over time. Of course, it was relatively inexpensive, but I did have higher hopes for the purchase. If you buy this, plan on needing something to carry it in. I think that the materials are too thin to use directly over a campfire. For a serious camper, I would consider looking at a more expensive product, which may last longer and be a better long term investment. It might be acceptable as a short term kit for scouting."
3,a bit to mature,"I bought this book for a second grade student in my class who is a select mute. It is a beautiful story, but is above grade level for my children. I have offered it to the parents to read one on one to their child."
3,Mary Ellen Mark: Exposure,The contents of the book mandate a rating of 5 stars... this is an excellent book. But the binding of the book rate a one star. The book - which is paper back - has no real way to keep the pages in... and the pages began to separate upon first use. So sad to put together such superb material in such a shoddy manner.
3,"A well researched, informative book but difficult to read.","The author has been most thorough in research and devotes great detail and attention to our understanding of the thought, political, social and religious forces of that milieu. The story of Galileo's trial and imprisonment is engaging.The book is easily put aside. Hundreds of figures over centuries who contributed to the events culminating in the trial enter and leave the pages of the book as players on the stage of a drama. The players, both important and relatively minor, do not play their parts in chronological order in this book. It is difficult to find a thread of thought or story which holds one's attention. In the end, the final events causing the trial of Galileo are not complex or lengthy. The actual causes and culmination of the trial are few and easily conveyed. The book does give the reader a thorough knowledge of a vast, detailed, historical setting for the drama."
4,Keep up your German skills,"For those of us living in a non German-speaking environment it is vital to keep up our knowledge of the language somehow, and I find audio cassettes an excellent medium.This 90 minute tape features four dialogues, each split into three or four parts. Each part is spoken once at normal speed, then again very slowly, so that one can catch all the words clearly, and finally again at normal speed. This is an effective method as it promotes comprehension and reinforces by repetition.A booklet with the full text of the dialogues accompanies the cassette.My main regret is that there is only one tape."
5,Wow! What A strong story! Wow!,"""During World War II in the air over Europe, there were many heroes in the 385th Bomb Group of the U.S.8th Air Force. Clearly Frank Mays was one of these. None, however, had a more interesting life between missions than Frank Mays--as he chronicled in his facinating story, ""And No Purple Heart""!"" Bob Silver, Pilot and Command Pilot, 385th Bomb Group-U.S.8th Air Force."
4,Good quality bass strings.,"I am learning the bass and was advised to try these strings by a friend. They arrived really quickly and were well sealed, which is important to me as I live in Hawaii and the moist atmosphere can cause excessive corrosion. Once rigged on my bass they sound great and give a good deep clean feel to the sound. Yep I will be buying D'Addario from now on, especially confident that I can keep them in my case and use them when I need without them corroding."
1,Horribly Outdated,"I just finished taking the Custodian I and II exams in Central New York ( March, 2008 )- 90 questions. This book didn't help at all. The contents are so outdated that it mainly dwells on material such as COAL fired boilers and asbestos covered pipes. In case you don't know - I don't think any school located near civilization has coal fired boilers anymore and asbestos is outlawed for the health hazard problems."
1,school custodian,The book did't cover any of the questions on the test. Big rip off!!! I should try to get my money back.
2,I would buy from seller again! Not book though!,Book was NOT helpful for exam!!!!!! Book came in great condition but not worth the financial plunge! Not the sellers fault more industry! Anyone want to buy it if you have the 40 dollars to throw away enjoy!
5,"Very gripping, thrilling story","I loved this book. I recommend this for anyone wanting to read something from the viewpoint of a realistically written teenaged girl. The characters are very well fleshed out, you can easily see these characters existing in the real world...or can you? The ensuing tale is full of supernatural happenings, and the narrator seems to be the only person that sees it. You become very close to her during the story. You want people to believe her. You want the underlying things happening to be exposed. It's almost frustrating, but that's what keeps you hooked and not wanting to leave her world for a second until the final page.I read this book in one sitting because I couldn't put it down! It really brings back the joy of reading to me. I will definitely read it again, too. There are so many themes and small details that I'm sure I missed during my first reading (most likely because I couldn't stop turning the pages!)."
1,Selling Fake Rolex Watches could end up in Jail,"If you sell Fake Rolex Watches you could end up in Jail. Even if you indicate or do not indicate this is Fake, you are not supposed to sell Fake watches."
5,great mascara!!!,"I didn't know this mascara, till now. It's great to use and it lasts all night long!!"
1,NOT for sensitive eyes,"I have used Clinique for years. I have very sensitive eyes, and had been using their Gentle Waterproof formula. It doesn't irritate the eyes, but it doesn't define lashes very well.So I tried this, and it gave me bloodshot eyes. Unfortunately, it took me about a week to figure out it was the mascara that was doing it. I think it flakes in the eyes.I have better luck with Clinique Lash Power or their High Impact mascara"
3,Good Spread,"This candle has a good smell and it spreads pretty far. If you dont cut the wick down a little before you light it, it will burn black and smokey. Even after I cut the wick down the last time I used it, the flame wanted to randomly get big and dance around and make black smoke, but it always seemed to calm down. I wouldnt leave this candle alone, even if you are just jumping in the shower. I felt like I needed to put the lid back on tight so it wouldnt light back up. It sounds silly, but the flame was quite the dancer."
2,Not really,Disingenuous title as there ain't much on the Beatles in this book. I expected an insight or two but was disappointed.
1,"Save your money, save your time","I think Laham's magazine, Harper's, is truly excellent, so I was surprised and disappointed by this book. This is an extremely slight book that offers no real insight and says nothing new about any of its subjects -- Transcendental Meditation, the Maharishi, or the Beatles (who appear very little). We learn that practicing TM has benefits but is not a panacea; the Maharishi was not all he was cracked up to be; and celebrities are treated differently than other people (and bigger celebrities more differently still) yet they are human beings too. Stop the presses!The best thing about this book is the photographs, many of which and others can be seen online at www.thebeatlesinindia.com. The fourth photo, of John Lennon, is the softest I've ever seen of him. Save your money: skip the book and see the pictures."
5,Wonderful rocking horse,I got this rocking horse for me to keep at Gransma's house..so my dolls set on it while not being used by grandchildren..its a Treasure..I cant tell you how long I looked for one affordable and Nice..I hit the JackPot with this one...Thank you Amazon.com and Seller..B.W.
2,Vitamins are a bad idea,"As other reviewers have noted, this product contains vitamins A, C, and E. This is a really bad idea, especially the vitamin A. It is not healthy to overdose on vitamin A.The good news is that you really have to pound down a lot of vitamin A to injure yourself. But consider that this product sells to health conscious people. Such people are likely to take vitamin pills already, and so any additional dose is redundant at best.I am disappointed. I have been looking for gum containing baking soda for a while. Following some scary comments from my dentist, I would like to apply the baking soda every time I eat fresh fruit or other acidic foods. For me, this is many times per day. I can find no other chewing gum that contains a significant amount of baking soda."
3,SO-SO,Product is very strong with a very short spray time but I don't care for the smell of it.Does NOT last as long as I expected it to or as long as Blue Magic.SO--for cost reasons and odor reasons plus not as long lasting as I thought for the price I give it an average.Really don't like the smell!
3,Air sanitizer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The description said it was a new car scent air freshener . I found that it does not smell at all like new car. It smells like a sanitized hospital room. It is very strong. Spray a small amount in room and leave the building for about an hour or so.
4,Smell-Be-Gone?,"This item definitely eliminates odors from the air. But, is not for removing odors from fabrics."
5,Best Odor Management On the Market,"I bought this for my 86 year old mother who is starting to have bowel incontinance. She lives in a retirement apartment complex and they told her if she couldn't do something effective to control the odor, she would have to leave and go to a nursing home. She had tried numerous other products that didn't do a good enough job. Now she is happy, the apartment manager is happy, and she is able to avoid going to a nursing home. If Ozium can neutralize, not just cover up, these kinds of odors, it can handle anything."
5,This product really works!,"I`ve just bought a house. The former owners were heavy smokers. I scrubbed the house from top to bottom and I still felt the smoke odeur. Then I heard of a product called Ozium. There was only one problem...The product were not to be found in any stores in Sweden. What to do? Go online and search. I found it! Rylee Industries Inc. sent me the product Ozium with a nice letter. My lucky day was when I got my package of Ozium.I just shaked the container, sprayed in the rooms and closed the doors. I did this for a few times. And guess what? The smoke odeur disappered! Completely. Amazing. Now when friends come over their only comments are how fresh it smells in my house! I'm happy and smiling! Thank you Ozium and Rylee Industries Inc.!6 Pack Ozium AIR Freshner Spray -- .8 Oz Original Scent"
5,Licka-licious Japanesque sound candy,"A musical cornucopia of lickalicious japanesque sound-bytes heavily reminiscent of Pizzicato Five-Blonde Redhead-Fiery Furnaces with a dash of Asobi Seksu and Bjork-y vocals.The whole sensation of listening to Deerhoof leaves you a bit (dare I say peppy) dizzy-happy-like-sipping-your-champagne too fast and downing bags full of candy all at the same time. It's true what everyone says, you'll either love `em or hate `em, but you can be sure that you've never heard anything quite like them.Every time I listen to this CD, I keep seeing candy canes and lollipops! The carnivale just came to town. Actually they are coming to the City on the 30th! Brilliantly imaginative, quirky, surprising and highly recommended!"
4,Good Stuff,Wake-up! You sleepyhead. Deerhoof is presenting you with the most compelling music of the now. Check it out. 100% pony back guarantee.
2,"Good reviews, bad bad music.","This album was heralded by Pitchfork. I thought I was in for something phenomenal and captivating. I found nary. Sure the songs are musically shound and the instruments are interesting, but it's nothing that grabs you nor does it make you want to listen to it again. I can't help but feel the singer is often off-key. If you don't like high whiney voices, you definetly don't want this. To conclude, it's good enough music, but what good is it if you don't want to listen to it more than once."
3,Excellent Grammar Section,"I like the book's organization and vocabulary. The grammar section is beyond excellent and quite easy to follow. On the down side, I ran into some frustrations with incorrect spelling, and I noticed that in some mistakes, such as in the transliterations (page 16) section: short ""a"" sounds like ""a"" in cat, not an ""a"" in father as the book documents; or the gh, which has two different distinct sounds. Some areas don't document the words in Perso-Arabic script, only the romanization.One area that baffled a new learner of Persian was the this -tun suffix, e.g. ""haletun chetor e?"" (page 36) or ""esmetun chi ye?"" (page 38). I was told by my friend that was an clitic suffix of -etaan, like those documented on page 29 under ""Possessive Suffixes"". I think this -tun vs. -etaan should have been explained clearly, as this makes the book inconsistent and maybe confusing."
4,"I can finaly understand my mother inlaw, now what do I do.","*My wife is a native speaker.For years I have struggled at family gatherings only knowing a few words. I have a Persian English Dictionary but do not read Persian, though my wife finds it very helpful.This book is a good starting point, I love the fact that it has phonetic pronunciation. I have some hearing loss so it has been a challenge for me to get things right. Already this book has helped me, I've only owned it a week now.*My wife was impressed with the variety of phrases. She was equally impressed with the 3500 word dictionary.I must say that for less than $8 this was money well spent.I would recommend this to any serviceman going to Afghanistan as a way to get more familiar with the locals."
5,Very nice and handy book for travelers,"Me and my wife where looking to find a good book for her to learn Farsi, and we found one in a bookshop in Manhatan last week, it is well designed, have almost everything that a person who wants to travel to Iran needs to read, in it. And best of all, it is pretty cheap. I have alreay recomend it to many of my friends and will recomend it to people who want to learn Farsi using our Farsi Learning Project (www.panjere.net/iran/language/learn/) that we will start on September 2001."
2,X-10 needs an update,"I have a pretty extensive X-10 system (15 modules) the IR543 will only control 1 thru 8, so you can't eliminate the X-10 RF remotes as I had hoped too. Also, the first unit I received was defective but was quickly replaced."
3,A nice way to add ir control to X10 devices,"This is just a standard X10 command center - with an IR interface. It does not come with a remote, so you'll have to have a universal remote that knows the codes. If you do, controlling the environment along with your A/V system - turning lights on and off, opening and closing drapes, etc - all becomes simple."
5,Great Driving Music,"Amazon recommended this album today and I've had it for over a year and still cue it up on my iPod when I'm in the car. It's perfect for a pool or beach day. I can understand why another reviewer thought the album was bland although bland is somewhat of a harsh way to describe it. If you're looking for intense, get on your feet, 3 AM after hours music this is not the album you want. Granted, you would probably not be interested in this compilation based on the release date if you're looking for cutting edge dance."
5,ultra fine!,Awesome compilation CD. Beyond my exspectations. Great CD to get the party started! I have recommended it to all my friends.
4,Chunky tunes,"Though usually reliable, sometimes the Ultra CDs are let down by the inclusion of cheesy, overly commerical tunes. This isn't one of them - Ultra Weekend features all solid tunes none of which would be out of place at your local out-of-hours club.Highlights include the storming 'Love on my mind' and 'B*tch', and even if hearing Stonebridge for the umpteenth time does make CD1 a little more commercial, it still whisks you away to a land of smiley faces. If you're looking for a good CD for the gym, then try this."
1,Not Like the others,"The other sets 2, 3, and 4 are pretty good, they have nice tunes mixed with a bunch of mediocre ones, par. But this one really has nothing."
2,Best tea ever,"This is my favorite tea. I am not a connoisseur, but I do drink a lot of tea. It has a wonderful flavor and smell."
5,not spectacular but clear,"i'm from germany, sitting in the town, hesse wrote peter c. and I read it yesterday in english. first, it's a great translation. but I think, the book is very european, so, whenn you read it in usa or elsewhere, you got a good feeling of the living art of the ""schwarzwald""(black forest), where the author came from. and you stay in the chance of the century, so I think, p.c. is today an historical and social adventure,more than a spectacular novel. but just for younger poeple between twelve and twentysomething, p.c. can help to find their way, hardly as deep as the famous siddhartha do"
5,Liberation through love,"Hermann Hesse is a superb writer. This book is very good for a first novel (and very good for a novel, period). I have read all of Hesse's major novels except Gertrude and I can honestly say that none of them moved me in the way which this book did. Hesse's description of the yearnings of one's soul are always stirring. But the story of the narrator's relationship with the hunchback, Boppi, is unforgettable. To claim that Peter did not find what he was looking for and that ""he does not enjoy life"", as one reviewer claims, is absurd. It completely misses Hesse's point. Anwyays, read the book and find out for yourself -- don't take my word for it."
5,"I love Herman Hesse, I Highly recommend this book","Great book from Herman Hesse, I am a huge fan of his work, and may be biased, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book, as I usually do with his work. Highly Recommended."
5,Coming of age story in West Virginia circa 1958,"This is an excellent story about growing up and graduating from a small-town Appalachian community. My parents were of the same age in a town near Crum, and this book leaves a good, detailed account of what it was like then. This book is very similar in narrative to ""Of Mice and Men"" and you can finish it in similar time. Stupendously funny, touching, and sometimes sad, it would make a very good movie script. The story revolves around a teenager, trapped in a small town, and his quest to find something meaningful to do and experience, and the influence of the people around him. A must read."
4,A Backwoods Christmas Story?,"Crum is one twisted little novel. Actually, it's less a novel than a collection of vignettes about the (non-fictional) coal-mining ghost town of Crum, WV, and the author's (presumably fictional) experiences growing up. After a long and tedious chapter of setup, Maynard takes off. He wears his Jean Shepherd influence on his sleeve a bit much in places, but there are far worse authors in this vein by whom to be influenced. As such, Crum tends to read like In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash with a bubbling cauldron of Freudian influence and a little A Man Called Horse for good measure. The whole thing is front-to-back delicious."
5,Another Catcher in the Wry,"I am biased to this book because I grew up in West Virginia, but I beleive anyone who loves coming of age books will enjoy Crum. It is a quick read and you will find yourself reading it agin. A wonderful first novel."
5,Would make a blockbuster hit if it ever becomes a Movie!!!,"Hopefully the book Crum will be made into a Movie someday dealing,with the offbeat life in a small West Virginia Town.Filmmakers should aggressively seek the rights from Lee Maynard possibly starring WV actors Daniel Boyd and David Selby and it should be filmed entirely in West Virginia and not in some plastic Hollywood Set.It would make a blockbuster hit if it's ever made into a movie!!!"
2,"CD review, CAUTION Annoying Background Sounds","This is the first audio book I have felt like returning immediately. It uses background music from what they call the Crum Sessions, and constant background noises allegedly enhancing the listening experience and heightening imagination. This review is a CAUTION for those that do not like background effects, as nothing in the description mentions dramatization.While I appreciate the time and production that went into marrying a great voice artist with the appropriate background sounds, I find it very distracting and annoying. This is an adult themed book, it doesn't need juvenile background foley effects.The book itself is charming, touching, shocking, and humorous. I would recommend skipping the audio version and reading the book if you are able. As other reviewers say, in the Jean Shepherd vein."
1,Crum,"too graphic, to raw, tho it might be true to the region, it does not need to be printed. no wonder some areas of the world get a bad name that does not re fleck was of most people of the area"
4,nice read,"Well written, the author paints pictures, using no more brush work than necessary, that can be easily visualized. Anyone who has grown up or lived in a small town will find they can vicariously relive some of their own coming of age experiences. Those with prudish tendencies may be offended by this seemingly nothing held back, gritty work of literature."
3,No instructions,"The iPod cover was fine, but the 'belt clip' came with no instructions on use and I couldn't figure out what the round part was for. :-P"
1,"Catchy title, pretty cover, but a big disappointment","If you want to buy this book to learn anything about the country, either in writing or in pictures, don't buy this book. What you will get in this beautifully prepared book with an inviting title appears to be the product of the author taking a short trip to a few mountains and a coupe of villages in Northern Iran, taking a dozen or so nature pictures, and on the return back to the US, deciding to put them together to make money. You get different shots of the same snowy mountain peaks and a few pictures of villagers wondering around, a road or two of somewhere in Iran, and nothing else. I mean, nothing else. I opened mine with great expectaions and anticiation, went through the whole book of pictures in 3 minutes, and was very very upset. I might just throw it away or keep it on the living room table because of its pretty cover."
2,Nice but not outstanding,"I was disappointed by the pictures in this book: they are nice but lack the originality and quality of an artful photographer. Since I am not a photography expert, I can`t elaborate about the mistakes or shortcomings of the photographer. As unknowledgeable about technique as I might be though, I know beauty when I see it. These pictures would be at home in a geography book or a travel guide: good but plain. Instead, I recommend ""The Bridge of Turquoise"" by Roloff Beny, a Canadian photographer. This book is full of magnificent pictures that please the eye and touch the soul like only the work of an artist can do."
5,"MAGNIFICANT,TOUCHING,MOVING AND MEMORABLE","WHAT A WONDERFUL BOOK.MR. NADLER HAS BROUGHT IRAN UP CLOSE FOR ALL OF US TO SEE. I HOPE HE WILL DO A SEQUAL AND BRING MORE JOY TO OUR HOMES. I PERSONALY HAVE BOUGHT MANY OF THE BOOKS AND GAVE AS SPECIAL PRESENTS TO MANY OF MY WONDERFUL IRANIAN AND AMERICAN FRIENDS, WHOM ALL HAVE BEEN GREATLY TOUCHED. MR. NADLER SHOWS HIS DEDICATION AND LOVE OF IRAN THROUGH HIS CAMERA LENSE , WHICH I AM SURE HE HAS SPENT DAYS, WEEKS AND MONTHS TRAVELING AND FOCUSING. THANK YOU MR. NADLER AND MAY ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK WILL BE MUCH APPRECIATED BY MANY.IDA TJEKNAVORIAN-SCHLOSSBERG"
5,CIA agent tells story of terrorism and espionage,"'Loose Alliances' is an action-packed page-turner for those who want to know more about the top-secret workings of the CIA. Jim and Diane are agents for the super-secret 'Bureau Six'. Their activities take them into the Far East, where their heroic fighting skills and understanding of terrorist behavior are neccesary to their very survival. The book raises questions about who really is the ""good guy"" in global affairs. Is it the multinational corporation, the international terrorist conspiracy, or the lone superhero?The author, Mike Seeley, lived in the Far East as part of his CIA assignments. He draws on his experiences to create an exotic cast of characters, including the Japanese mistress/spy, the self-made Chinese mafia-lord, and the deviant, diabolical multinational leader.If you're looking for an entertaining, exciting, international adventure, 'Loose Alliances' is the essential read."
5,This book rocks!,"This book works through some great effects in cookbook style, such that if you follow the recipe, you can great some fantastic results. Although I am using CorelDraw 8 LE on the Mac, and am a beginner when it comes to graphic arts, I was still able to amaze friends and family with the output!The written style is clear, concise and easily understood, and the side bars are very informative. The color pictures in the center of the book are helpful in defining the target look, and the enclosed CD with electronic ""recipes"" and results is great.This is now in my top 10 technical book list!"
1,Where's Carole Dulaine?,"I wonder why vocalist Carole Dulaine, with Beneke 10-12 years, is not mentioned or on these newer CD's?"
3,Great Performance - Poor Recording,"Read the other reviews to find out about the performance (it's great), but if you're wondering about the sound quality, I'll tell you that the people doing the recording were amateurs. It's very obvious. On a couple of tracks, you can hear someone repositioning a microphone, banging it against something in the process. These were left off of previous editions, but restored to this one due to historic considerations and the fact that they're good tracks, but the entire disc suffers from improper mic placement. Everybody sounds far away from the microphones.If you're a Mingus completest, or if sound quality isn't a major concern, you'll want to get this. But if sound quality is a big deal to you, I'd pass."
2,Tiny earrings,"I do mean tiny earrings. Loved them because I could keep them in at night, but easily lost one of them because they were so tiny I couldn't find it in the carpet."
5,great book,This is a great product. I'm very happy with my purchase. Prompt delivery. Great condition. I would definitely buy here again.This is a great product. I'm very happy with my purchase. Prompt delivery. Great condition. I would definitely buy here again.
3,A to M,"Please note: this is only letters A-M. If you want N-Z as well, you need to buy volume 2 also!"
3,Half Full or Half Empty?,"Offered as a companion to the Crystals' Shakespeare's Words: A Glossary & Language Companion, The Shakespeare Lexicon and Quotation Dictionary (with the subtitled advertisement ""Every word defined and located, more than 50,000 quotations identified"") proves useful up to a point, that is, the letter M. My expecting the whole alphabet was naive, I guess, in this era of computer generated offers. RW"
1,"Terrible charger, bad batteries from Duracell!","I've had this charger and batteries for a day now. Batteries get really hot, but never charge. They won't go past 1.46 volts, and understandibly so. This is a real cheap rig, I even tried a different charger which eventually charged them fully. Don't buy this item unless you are looking for a nice hand warmer. Batteries get really warm, but never charge!"
1,THE WOLFETONES,"This was probably the worst example of Irish music we have watched,,,merely an anti-British political statement by a bunch of drunkards,,,We only watched about two thirds of it until we gave up in disgust,,,"
2,A PIECE OF JUNK,I have had this book every since is was published. I decided that I would read it and I should have left it on the shelf. I got so tired of Cupcake running away and getting caught only to be sent back to the foster home. The book is so boring I have just completely put it down. I don't plan on finishing it. I thought with all of the raving reviews that it would hold my interest. Sorry Ms Brown I didn't like this one.
1,Very Disappointing,"I knew very little about this book when I bought it, so I had no preconceived ideas about the story. Unfortunately, it doesn't take long to realize this book is a fabrication. I realize family law and social services of the 1970's were substandard, but the custodial chain of events in this book makes no sense. And never have I heard of an 11 year old child taking to alcohol and drugs from the first MOMENT of use. And if she did abuse drugs and alcohol to the level described, there's no way this VERY detailed account could be possible. I have experience in this area.... I know! The entire tormented-rebel account of her early years has a self serving quality to it that is similar to the depiction in A Million Little Pieces. I'm sure Mrs. Brown's real life story would have been far more interesting than the embellishment presented here."
5,Great book of inspiration and determination.,"This is a great book to inspire those in addiction who think they can't change, or make it back. It is also a great look at the things that cause a person to fall into self destructive habits, i.e. abuse, broken families, and preditors. It is a great guide for those seeking to work with abused and addicted persons. It identifies what is required from you to hug someone back to life. Thank you sister Brown, May God continue to Bless you to be a Blessing for us all."
5,AWESOME AND INSPIRING!!!,"I thought that this book was FABULOUS!! Cupcake's strength and perseverance are to be admired. I could not put the book down. I laughed, I cried, I screamed, I cursed, I prayed. This books gets you in touch with a variety of emotions on a very raw level. She puts James Frey's fictional account of a biography to shame. This book is RAW and in your face. [...] will be kicking herself for allowing that liar on her show first. Cupcake's story is the REAL DEAL!!!"
5,"phenomenal, real, raw memoir","This memoir was phenomenal and incredibly difficult for me to put down. Cupcake holds nothing back as she recounts her life's trial, and eventual rise from them, in a purely raw format which results in an emotional read. What's amazing to me, besides the tragic events Cupcake has endured, is her writing style. The vernacular and tone used throughout the memoir is not one of recollecting the past, but reliving the past - which is evident through the vocabulary used and how it evolves appropriately throughout the story. I am in awe with Cupcake's story; not only all of the horrible experiences she has had in life, but how she recovered from them. It was inspiring to read how God and other angels in her life helped her in times of need. I highly, highly recommend this book, you won't be disappointed!"
3,"Good message, memorable life","Ms. Brown has experienced far too much horror in her life, and most of it occurred before she was twenty years old. Fortunately the last half has been a remarkable testimony to survival, faith and perseverance.This book is quite readable although about 100 pages too long. It didn't necessarily benefit from all the profanity either.Her story is amazing and remarkable. Very much on par with James Frey's memoir A Million Little Pieces. I am quite impressed with Ms. Brown's ability to recall an inordinate amount of detail from so many years of being drunk and high. That is quite an accomplishment."
4,A Piece of Cake,"I read this book for a class. I really liked it. The writing was easy to read and the story was inspiring. The book is an auto-biography of the author's experience of sexual abuse, drug use, gang activity, and later becoming a successful attorney. Even though it dealt with very serious and tragic issues, the tone was light-hearted and humorous. I recommend this book to anyone needing inspiration to face life's challenges."
5,Just started reading this...,"Oh my! I just started this, and I'm only about an hour into it, and I don't think I can finish it...her writing is poignant, raw & heartwrenching...when I get past the emotions of my first Christmas without both my grown daughters being home, I'll pick it up again....I just cried for 2 hours!! But, I know it's going to be an amazing journey."
4,Heart breaking yet inspiring,"For her first attempt I think she did a pretty darn good job!Again I am extremely skeptical, I read this book because it was recommended by a relative. It took a few moment to catch my attention, however once it took hold of me, I was hooked. I am a paralegal so immediately I went searching for answers as to why certain things were allowed to happen to this child, however, smh this is America and too many of our children fall victim to the injustices of the system... I would recommend checking out Running from Solace- Nakia Lashaul, Fish and Grits- Tina Smith Brown, ANYTHING Bernice Mcfadden or Mary Monroe has written.... Excellent Black Authors who avoid the trend of writing literary trash"
3,A (Large) Piece of Cake...,"Well, I read some of the prior reviews on this book - both good and bad. I decided to go ahead and purchased the book. The first quarter of the book is very graphic and made me terribly sad for this girl...this child that had been so wronged. The second quarter was much the same. I am now midway thru the book and I hate to say it, but it is losing my attention. It's very drawn out. I think Cupcake could have accomplished this story in much less than 400 or so pages. Some of the things that happened to ""Cup"" are hard to believe, but, I do believe her story....a lot can happen to someone who feels ""lost"". I am struggling to finish this book, but, I will finish it and will be glad when I do. Then I can move on to something else. This book is so graphic, I don't think I want to even recommend it to anyone....my daughter is a big reader and I don't think she would like this book at all."
5,A Must Read for Black Women In Recovery,"This is not your typical rags to riches story. Cupcake Brown, ""Cup"", has one of the most powerful testimonies that I've ever read or even heard. I am a fellow recovering addict, and this story has empowered me, motivated me and encouraged me to KEEP ON taking the necessary steps to maintain my sobriety. I'm not sure if any other book has ever or will ever replace this as my favorite.Cupcake goes from a crack addicted nobody to holding one of the most highly sought after career positions imaginable. She remains humble through it all and doesn't brag or boast about how SHE did it - holding true to the principles of 12 step recovery, she shares the precious gift that she's been given by God in order to keep it."
2,Interesting read but full of LIES,"This book was a pretty good read and a page turner, but it's a memoir, and should be called ""A Piece of Fiction"". How the HECK CAN SHE REMEMBER ALL THESE LITTLE STORIES AND BITS OF INFORMATION when she was drugged and high?!?! For her to write such a long book describing small details of what went on during the years of crazy drug use and ""blackouts"", she would have to have THE BEST memory on the planet, even after years of drugs and waking up next to a dumpster.And sorry, but no law firm would hire a girl that came in dressed like a slut, talking back, and hadn't brushed her hair or teeth in weeks.Nuff said."
3,Recovery story rings true,"I have been in recovery for a few years and I'm glad I read Brown's book. I didn't find the book especially well-written from a literary-criticism standpoint, but when she talks about using, about hitting bottom and about early sobriety, she could have been describing me - not the things we did, but how we *thought* - the attitudes that kept us active addicts/alcoholics. Our stories are all different, but the disease is the same.I'd recommend Brown's book to people who are interested in addiction and recovery."
5,amazing,"Book was shipped quickly! Great condition as if I bought it new! The book was fabulous, I am referring it to girls in Juvenile hall for a great read!"
4,I enjoyed but...,It started off awesome but towards the end like just trying to hurry up and finish. Even though it was a true story.A good book on a very cold night. However I enjoyed A Piece of Cake!!
2,Disappointed,"In the beginning of this book I found it a bit disturbing; however, I pressed on and I was glad. I soon came to be highly disappointed by this book though because it seemed so cliche` in the fact that almost every drugged out junkie seems to find a god and heal themselves; then discuss it for 15 chapters. Aside from that fact, almost 3/4 of the book was about doing various drugs, I felt it was drug out too long and could have been summed up in fewer chapters. It got to be monotonous and tiresome reading about the authors junkie habits over and over again. Although the book had great potential and could have been one of the greats; I felt it became monotonous."
2,Can't Suggest It,"The book is complied of 52 chapters (not including the epilogue). She spent more than 40 of those chapters talking about her extensive drug usage and clearly defining the term ""trash can junkie"". However, less than 5 of those chapters discussed her climb out of the hell her life had become. She condense 8+ years of school (including law school) in a few chapters, whereas, she spent centuries describing her living conditions, gang banging, prostitution, and alcoholic/drug induced blackouts. This lack of balance made the book feel as if it was dragging you through her life. Each chapter ended with an invitation into a deeper degree of torture. Every time I came back to the book, I felt depressed and just wished it would end.Sorry, Cup. Just my personal opinion."
5,A Piece of cake is a piece of Hope!,"For those who do not know Attorney Cupcake Brown, I encourage you to visit her website, read this book and learn of her. For those who do not believe that there is a GOD who works miracles still, visit her website and read this book. This should be the next ""based on a true story"" movie. Are you listening Oprah?"
3,Kinda Disappointing....,"Cupcake Brown truly is a hero of a miserable childhood....so sad. I gotta give her credit for what she has accomplished overcoming all odds to get there. She really gives you and inside view of gang life. The drug/alcohol abuse and the consequences are so graphic, that I found it hard to read sometimes. The only drawback to her book is if you didn't know how to do drugs, you will have an education after reading this book. To me, it sends out the wrong message to vulnerable people."
1,Seemed fabricated,"The book started off very interesting, however as I continued to read a lot of the story seemed fabricated. It is obvious by the way the book reads, that the author has made a lot of the details up. If you're looking for a good auto-biography this is not the book for you."
4,Story starts well and ends just so so.,"For the first 250 pages this was the best memoir I have ever read. I touted it to all of my friends, neighbors, and anyone who would listen. When I got to the last 200 pages, however, I was bored by the writing style which seemed (forgive me) lazy.Overall, however, Ms. Brown's story is absolutely incredible and she should be commended for getting through adversity that would have killed anyone else. I loved the way she wrote so candidly."
4,a great memoir,"i thought this book was great, but i didnt read it all at once because it got boring at some parts. it was amazing how she turned her life around!! i really think that God was watching over her because she was so lucky!! it was amazing how she overcame everything."
3,Too Much!,I'm not a fan of memoirs but I heard this one was pretty good. It took me forever to finish reading this but I sympathize with all that Cupcake went through even though I don't want to hear sorted details of drug abuse and sexual favors. It seems that Cupcake did anything for her next high but still lived to tell the story. That's a wonderful thing but the book could have been shorter and explained the same amount of information.
2,poorly written,"This woman has risen above some terrible circumstances;I agree to this fact 100%, but with that being said her editor should have really taken a red pen to this horrible writing style. Considering Cupcake is now a lawyer I would think she would be a stronger writer? Also, something about her story feels exaggerated, as if they exploited her life even more. Overall there are a few golden moments in the book but many key characters are never fully developed or simply disappear leaving a lot of unanswered questions."
3,Great Testimony,"I really enjoyed this book. A bit long( that's why 3 instead of 4 stars) but is a testament to what God can bring you from. A successful lawyer that tells how she survived abuse, addiction, and poverty to rise above it all. Very inspiring."
3,so so,It was a so so story. It was okay but didn't really hold my attention. I did not finish the story
2,Book Review,"I am not a prude but, while life as it truly was for this girl, it is a pretty raunchy book for a teenager (I am a Senior Citizen).If you are buying with thought of giving to a Teen, I would encourage you to read the book first to see if appropriate for ""your girl""."
5,Truely Amazing!!,"I recommend that everyone who consider themselves a reader to buy this book, it will take your breathe away!"
4,"She's No James Frey, and that's a Good Thing.","I learned about this book because I heard she had a real beef with James Frey and how his dishonesty might cast wrongful doubt on her story. I think she has a good point, as does another author who wrote a similar tale of hitting rock bottom and rising to the top- only his disease was mental illness rather than drug and alcohol addiction. In fact, Frey actually wrote a nice blurb on the back of that book ""Hammerhead 84"" way before Frey's book became famous.Either way, these are fine stories and well written books that deserve to be believed and treasured."
1,A Piece of Fake? Four stars entertaining One star believable,"This book could could be categorized as fiction and it still would sell.Does it remind you of A Thousand Little Pieces? Yes, too much does not sound believable. Why? She claimed to have lied on her resumes to get hired in law firms and for several office jobs. How did she managed to stay employed as long as she claimed when she came to work high? How did she manage to be competent at work while being high? And no one checked her references and checked out her background? How does she recall so much detail when she was using drugs, pills and alcohol? Her friends she claimed also helped with memories. But many of her friends were getting high with her. The times when she wrote about experiences they were written as if she was alone and she claimed to be high. So, how does she recall so much, while claiming to be so high and no one was with her to recall the incidents as she claimed to remember?"
5,Best book I've read on addiction and the street,"Wow, I was blown away by Ms. Brown's honesty and reveting prose. She tells it like it is, keeps it real."
5,Cupcake,"This book is so inspiring! Cupcake takes you on a journey through her trials and tribulations, I am very familiar with some of the neighborhoods that she experiences. If she made it out of there with her life, that's a testimony in itself! I read this book some years ago, and I gave it to someone who was coming from where Cupcake had been, just to try say if she did it you can also, however she never read it, I ordered it again for a loved one with the same circumstances, and it has inspired her to return to school, I'm so thankful for this book! Thank you, Cupcake Brown"
5,Simply Amazing,"I read the previews of this book and thought I need to get this book!! When I recieved this book I began reading immediatley a remarkable story, Cupcake had a lot of ups and downs in her life but with God and supportive people around her any thing was possible!!If you havent read this book I suggest you pick it up a true page turner."
5,Raw,"This book is one that everyone needs to read that is trying to achieve anything in life and think they can't whatever the reason is.The transparency in which she writes is unbelievable.After reading this book, it will make you think that nothing is impossible whatever it may look like."
5,A Piece of Cake: A Memoir,"I truly enjoyed this book. It kept my attention, it was an easy read and most importantly, it gave me a better understanding of the life of people who unfortunately get involved in alcohol, gangs or drugs--the ""street"" terms used for drugs or gangs, why people get involved in gangs and drugs and what affect it has on people and their family. What's even more awesome is the fact that through everything Cupcake endured, she went on to become an attorney. This book (and Cupcake Brown) is a definate motivator for anyone regardless of their idiosyncrasies. I highly recommend this book............."
3,Amazing life story,It was hard to read so much of the painful part of her life. But it was very inspirational to read once she got to recovery and beyond.
3,Book Review,I was not impressed by the length of descriptions re her horrible life and the small amount of time placed onpositive issues.
1,"Save your money and wait for the movie, it'll be cheaper and someone else will write the screenplay","The writing in this book was so poor, despite what promised to be an excellent and inspiring story, I gave up after the first chapter. The irony of course is that in the acknowledgements Ms. Brown praises her editor (and the rest of the known world) to high heaven. I had to scratch my head and wonder what exactly did the editor do here? Coming fast on the heels of the James Frey debacle, I'm glad that the author was careful to validate the veracity of her memoir, but as big an injustice as Frey committed with his lying, you have to give him credit for one thing. At least his book was a page turner. A Piece of Cake is just a bomb."
3,Got me going in circles!,"Ok this book was really not that bad, it actually started off really good and held my attention for quite some time, But as I continued to read I found myself getting quite bored that i had to skim the last couple of chapters because it was so long and drawn out, plus I got tired of the author repeating the same mistakes over and over again which really digusted me. This book was just a huge roller coaster ride that gave me constant headaches in the end.Good luck trying to get through this one!"
3,A Piece of Cake,This book was an interesting look into a troubled past. Some of it seems to be a stretch but still a very interesting story.
4,Inspiration,This author has written about her life trials and being up against all odds. Only my opinion:I would not have delineated at the extent she does concerning other peoples private sensitive information.Cupcake persevered with courage.I think she has been an inspiration for all women and men coming from broken homes and suffering from addictions. Cupcake has shown her readers just how important and powerfull it is to have faith in yourself.
4,Keeps Thy Attention,"Beginning is truly heartbreaking, shows the messed up world of foster care, a lot of drug/sex/alcohol, a little slow near the middle, end result = inspiring. I'd recommend it."
5,Awesome Read,Thank you Amazon for offering this book at such a great price. I've ordered several copies for my book club.
5,Couldn't put it down!,"One of my all time favorite books. Funny, moving, and amazing. You will not believe it is true nor will you be able to put it down. No matter what time my sweetheart came home, I was reading it. It got to the point I refused to drive when we went out so I could read more!"
5,MUST READ BOOK,A PIECE OF CAKE IS A MUST READ BOOK. IT IS A INSPIRATIONAL STORY OF A CUPCAKE BROWN. HER STORY WILL MOVE YOU AND HER HARDSHIP WILL SHOW YOU THAT YOU CAN INDURE ALMOST ANYTHING AND STILL OVER COME. I WOULD RECOMMEMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE. ONE YOU START THIS BOOK ITS HARD TO PUT DOWN!
5,Excellent book,What an emotional roller coaster ride this book was!! I did not want to put it down. Cupcake Brown did an oustanding job taking us through her life. I highly recommend this book!!
3,ok but lacking some key characteristics,"These pots and pans are TINY. Much smaller than I'd expected, although if I were more familiar with the measurements I might have expected that. Will do decently cooking for one. For two I had to split the food up and cook it twice. For a family this is probably not very practical. Also, (and I know this is camp stuff, not gourmet kitchen ware, but still...) the pots burned and the discoloration did not come off with washing. Also the handles are rather flimsy and difficult to hold on too when they start flopping around. For my once or twice a year camping excursions these will work just fine, but if I were a ""regular"" I'd want something more substantial. They do come neatly packaged in a convenient little carry case and are light weight, so might be preferable if you are hiking and carrying your stuff up the mountain. I camp in campgrounds and bring a sink, propane stove, multiple coolers, you get the idea."
3,Nice Set,This set is good except for the fact that one of the folding handles on the medium pan was tweaked and wouldn't fit inside the larger pan as intended.
1,junk,this is junk............. the handles wont close together and it is cheaply made and the sack to hold it is way to big so it moves all over in you pack and to return it I had to pay postage.
1,Contains lead!!!,"This set contains lead!!! I am not one of those overly paranoid ""everything is bad for you"" type of people, but cookware definitely should not contain lead! Do yourself a favor, and your future generations a favor, and buy a different (safer) cook-set."
5,Great capacity and high quality ink,"This cartridge has a pretty high capacity. I've used it with my CX6400 printer/scanner/copier for the past 3 weeks and it's held through and I still have about 3/4 of the ink left and I've printed a lot of things. Recommended from this site verses a place like Best Buy, who charge $12.99, whereas Amazon charges only $10.79."
4,Great device and design,"I bought this device because of the SD slot. I like to have all my mp3 on the SD Card and use the device as an mp3 player.Sound quality is ok but could be better, great size and design.It would be nice to have an on/off button.I'm anyway really happy with it."
1,Didn't work,"Tried it with a USB flash drive and (a) could not find a channel without lots of static, (b) took 30-60 seconds to move between songs and (c) third time I used it nothing happened at all, and it stopped working permanently. Oh well, serves me right for not reading the other reviews."
4,"MP3/Wma Fm Transmitter w/Sd, USB & Audio Input","This is for my husband and he says. . .This works as advertised, when using a memory card. It does not work when using a thumb drive.I am trying to contact the manufacturer to ask about this unit being defective.It is nice to have CD capability on a memory card playing on the car stereo."
1,It did not work,"The item shown was not the item received, the item did not work, when inserted into the cigarette lighter the display lit up but did not recognize the SD card or the radio station.I contacted the seller, they said the company they repesent placed the wrong picture on the site. They are trying to find an MP3 player that works. I am confident that they will be successful."
3,Grate solution for hearing mp3 files in your boat and car!,"Grate product!, may be a little more power output make it a top 10 product! that is a good parameter for comparing this technology."
3,MP3 Car Modulator,"FM signal strength above some of others I've tested before but random function is very poor, generally replays same songs over and over. When the car is restarted the modulator restarts the last song from beginning instead of restarting from where it was stoped."
1,Junk,Don't waste your money on this product. It only has a 90 day warranty and I had one fail in the first 90 days and the second one only lasted long enough to finish the warranty. Save you money look elsewhere for a better product.
3,Finicky,"I purchased this device solely to use the USB port to play music. Since I don't own an iPod or similar device, I've never used the side port. I have also never used the SD card slot.At first I used a 2 Gig jump drive full of mp3 music with some in folders. With the player on ""shuffle"", it would sometimes take minutes to find the next song. With ""shuffle"" off, it would find the next song right away.I reduced the number of songs on the jump drive to be just less than 1 Gig of music and have every file at the top level (no sub-folders). This helped enourmously. With ""shuffle"" mode, the next song plays much quicker.The sound quality is as good as any FM station so long as you find a frequency without music. For the money, it was a good deal. Especially since you can get 1G jump drives for free with mail in rebates. If you want more quality and capabilities, buy an iPod with FM transmitter."
4,Really works as described,For the price from Amazon I have no complaint. I tried both SD Card and USB cards.SD cards work a bit faster but that may because the USB card I used was 1 GB while my SD cards were 512 MB. All in all I am pleased with the unit. I have had it for two months and hope it will hang in for months to come.Why not 5 stars ??? The warranty is only for 30 days. That time is far below the industry standard for electronic. Sort of a red flag that this company has no faith in the durability of this unit.I use this unit in my motor home and find its transmission range is very good. FM radios in the rear pick up the transmission signal with ease. Would say range is about 30 feet or so.
4,Works pretty much as I expected,"VR3 MP3 PLAYER WMA USB SD FM MODULATOR TRANSMITTERAfter reading about several different models and brands, I bought this unit and I am very pleased. The sound quality, while not CD quality is very good -- similar to the music coming through my Sirius, and the features, especially the last track memory are very nice. You can pause, skip to the next song, and shuffle your playlist. I occasionally get a little background noise that seems to depend on the area that I am in more than anything. Again this is similar to my Sirius that used the same technology to transmit to my radio. I tried a couple of stations before deciding on the best one -- the first frequency I tried seemed okay during the day but had a distant station coming in at night. If the sound quality would be a little better I would have given this a FIVE, but I think everyone except for a real audiophile will enjoy this little unit."
2,Didn't last,"Mine didn't last more than 8 months. I'm buying a different brand today to try that out. Wouldn't recommend this one. It worked great at first, but then it would cut in and out, misread some of songs (skipping), etc."
1,"No NO NOOOOO DON""T BUT THIS THING","I bought this thing and the first time I used it I thought it was broken. It takes about three blocks for this thing to play anything from your USB drive. I haven't used the other features. From time to time I have been driving and a song would come on that I didn't want to hear, trying to jump forward a track and have bumped and it has turned off. This upsets me so much having to wait for it to start up again. I would have sent it back for a refund already if my daughter hadn't dropped the instruction book in a mud puddle. I'm totally unhappy with it!!!"
2,"Great idea, poor sound quality","I was so disappointed with the sound quality of this device that I returned it. Music files that sounded great on my computer were noticably reduced in quality due to the FM transmission. I thought Audio Books would work, but there is so much hissing and buzzing that it was hard to concentrate on the book. BE WARNED there is NO REWIND or FAST-FORWARD through a track. There are only forward and backward track skip. If you have a large audio book file and lose your place or forget to pause when you leave the car, you cannot get back to your position in the file. The device ""remembers"" which track you were playing when it loses power, but it starts over from the beginning of the track, not at the place in the track where you left off, as in a CD player. The lack of a power switch seems quite odd to me as well. Overall, the device seemed like a great idea, but it just wasn't thought out well enough."
1,Don't buy this junk,"I bought this and within ten minutes it failed. I was completely dissappointed with this purchase. I loved the concept, but the product is cheap and will not hold up to normal use. Lesson learned!"
3,"crappy sound, but they're all the same",great because it has both the sd card slot and a jack to plug any iPod or else.No so cool because most of the time the sound sucks pretty bad... But then again I have never heard one that sounds good no matter what brand.
4,Fantastic customer support,"This is an amazing device. I've had one for over 2 years and it worked flawlessly until i wore it out. I ordered 2 replacements but one had a problem and wouldnt work. However, VR3 gave me a refund and took care of the issue in a very professional manner.Great device, even better customer support."
4,Works great for audiobooks and podcasts,"This product worked great for me. What I like most is that it will pick up on the track where it left off, which makes it great for use with audiobooks and/or podcasts. Since it starts at the beginning of the track, I use an mp3 editor to split large audiobook files into 2-3 minute segments. Then if I turn off my car, it will pick up again no more than 2-3 minutes before I left off. Not perfect, but this trick works like a charm for me. Some static from time to time, but nothing I can't just ignore."
4,It works,"I've tried belkin units with bad results.This one works, has good features for the price, and was simply the only way to inexpensively get mp3 music into my two cars - a 97 Cadillac Deville and 92 Buick Riviera. It seems to easily over power the high end stations in its range in my area. Just drove from Pottstown PA to Cherry Hill, NJ and it never missed a beat. Its sound quality is not exactly CD, but it is better than I expected. Almost as good as cassettes play in the cars.Must admit, I'm on my second one. The first one just quit, burned out or something. But I liked the unit so much I exchanged it hoping that this one lasts.My SD card is only 256M, so I can't fit more than two albums on it, so I'm not so concerned that I don't have a lot of control over the playback. The screen is too small to read most of the time without getting up close, but I don't need to read it anyway. Its so cool that the player plugs right into the 12v socket- no cords!"
2,USB didn't work,"I was looking forward to getting the transmitter because of the SD port. Well, the SD port was the only thing that was decent about it. It played good but the display did not read ""true"" ID3 tagging like it was advertised as having. It reads the name of the mp3 file - ONLY.The USB slot did not work at all. I tried a Lexar and a Sony. The lights on the drives lit up but the display on the transmitter did not change and it did not play any music at all.The other bad thing about this is the display does not work (and not supposed to) at all with an mp3 player!If you read the ""fine print"" - about the display feature, it says ""when available"". I guess I am expecting too much out of a $50 technical item.I'm sure one day, another company will come up with something like this that will work and advertise everthing accurately without any hidden statements."
2,Worked Good for About A Year,I purchased this product about 1 year ago. It worked great using SD and USB memory. After a year the unit began to fail. Now it may or may not work.
1,Worked well for a short time.,"This device worked pretty well considering its small size and many features. Most of my files have artist and title linked, and you can read the display if you absolutely need to. A big improvement over earlier transmitters that cost much more and had to be in line of sight with the antenna, plus this one does not even need an mp3 player.Unfortunately, it worked just under 60 days and now displays ""no media."" I have had a VR3 head unit in my van since Oct that plays mp3 cd, usb, line-in, sd card and reads the new hd signals. It was $89 and has performed impressively."
1,mp3 modulator,This is the second one that I have bought and I have yet to get this thing to work. I've tried using key discs and SD cards.
1,NEVER WORKED,"Just the first time, I used it, the signal was little bit noisy (even with the adjustemnts), but then I pluged it out for the nigth, next morning I pluged in again and it symply never worked again."
4,Aprendiendo Office,"Si desea aprender los programas de Office 2000, pero usando la version de los programas en ingles, este es su libro. Le ensena cada funcion de los programas Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, y Outlook paso a paso. Hay mejores libros que este, sobretodo por que el libro esta escaso en graficos pero no encontrara un libro que lo explique tan detalladamente a tan bajo precio."
4,"Too many movie references, but otherwise a wonderful book","I find it a little pompous of other readers to thumb their noses at this werewolf volume because it includes so many references to modern day serial killers. Obviously they missed the author's whole point! I loved this book BECAUSE it draws such a clear connection between the types of crimes traditionally attributed to werewolves and those commited in modern times by men such as Jefferey Dahmer. This book is also FILLED with traditional folklore from Europe, Asia, AND the Americas. My ONLY complaint with this book is that it wastes so much space on cinematic werewolves and the actors who have portrayed them."
2,Werewolves etc etc etc,"I picked up this book thinking that I was getting a book about werewolves. Although it does contain some werewolf lore, it also contains a lot of information that is really a stretch to relate it to werewolves. I agree with others who've mentioned serial killers--why here? Also there is repetitive information in entries with no cross reference to other places where the same thing is discussed--seems like padding as other reviewers have mentioned. There are some interesting tidbits here, but a werewolf or shapeshifter book, it's not."
1,"Off Subject, Utterly Disappointing","For anyone who is truly interested in lycanthropy or shapeshifting, this book is not for you. It covers movies, serial killers, the Yeti, and bunch of crap that is mostly irrelevent to the subject.The very few facts in this book were things I figured out before I graduated high school. That should give you an indication of how well-thought out Steiger's book is.The goal of the book was a good one, however, it was a feeble attempt. Just spend a day at the library and look through real encyclopedias on the subject, and you will likely find at least twice the information that is available in this piece of trash."
1,Didn't read but looked inside...,Check out the viewable sample of the book first! I looked through the index and it doesn't even have an entry for lycanthrope or lycanthropy. What kind of Werewolf Encyclopedia would omit the scientific terminology for a werewolf?
3,So-so,"I wish this book would be more picture heavy. Otherwise if you are a lycanthrophile this one is the book to go. Sometimes it not only discusses werewolf but other shapeshifting beings as well, making it an interesting pastime.However, since werewolf is fictitious, no matter what you think, most of what is written in this book is derived (gasp!) from movies. So don't take it too seriously.We have our inner beasts to contend with, but let's face it, it's more metaphoric than literary."
3,actually more like 2.5,"Even though most people didnt like the serial killers in this book i did. However,I did not like the movie and tv shows part of the book,I think it could have done just fine without that. Another part that irked me was the fact that he put the pentagram only with christian mythology and there are alot of religions that use the pentagram,christians wont even touch it now. Otherwise this book was a fun and interesting read. Don't pay money for it though,try to get it from the library."
5,Great Resource for Werewolf Information...,"The Werewolf Book is a tool. A great tool. It is a launch pad; an introduction into the far reaching corners of another world. With in its 600 pages, it covers a vast history of myth, legend, and even film, leaving no stone unturned. As a writer, I felt it extremely useful. It was and is, extremely easy to pick up and read. Written in an encyclopedia form, allows me to jump to a needed subject matter in minutes. It also opened doors for further study.If you are looking for a book that will help you study the varied world of werewolves and their alike, then the Werewolf Book is the book for you!"
2,If you want a good bedtime story....,This book is only good to read when you are unable to sleep. The turtle chapter was pointless. It did not get better as it went on. It got more boring. We HATE this book. We do not recommend this book to anyone.
1,Bite me Steinbeck...,"If one could have rated this book as a negative star amount, I would have been that person. This book is 600 pages of pure torture. My opinion is that the law enforcement agencies should use the form of this book on tape, along with some Woodie Guthrie Dust Bowl Hits, to force criminals out of hostage situations. I, along with my fellow A.P. classmates, were subjected to this horrible display of literature by the ever lovin' Mrs. Ehteshami-Afshar fo Morris, Illinois. The ending is as if Mr. Steinbeck was bored out of his mind, so he just decided to stop writing and tie up ends. This book reads more of a history document than of anything closely resembling a novel. A.P. students unite, and rid the classroom of this boring work of literature! WORD..."
4,a very good buy for its price,"I bought the irock mp3 player last month, and its been really great using it so far. its easy to set up, and very light. It comes with a cool leather carrying case that seems to be very well designed. the earphones that come with it are pretty good, but not the best. Its biggest pro is the music quality and the easy-to-use interface. Its even got an FM tuner, which ought to come in handy when you don't have any songs to play. Another major plus is the battery. It uses AA and the battery life is pretty good. If you already have rechargeable batteries like me, its perfect for youNow for the cons - the FM tuner isn't really that good, and it doesn't pick up anything but the strongest signals. The headphones aren't really good for running as they keep falling off (they did for me)Otherwise, I would rate it as a very good buy."
1,irock 830,I got this for X-mas in 2003. I am now in the market for a better MP3. In General this mp3 player sucks. A nice MP3 that holds up to 60 hrs. of songs like the apple Ipod or the Dell DJ is a much better MP3! not like this which only carries 20 songs!!! which is better? The only good thing about this is the fm radio. The bateries didnt last very long AND IT ONLY HOLDS 20 SONGS! TRUST ME YOU ARE GOING TO RUN OUT OF ROOM VERY FAST. In my opinon you should buy a Dell DJ 15 GB it is cheaper the Apple Ipod 15 GB. so you won't be spending to much on the same and not to little on 20 SONGS!
2,missing the mark of what scandivania has to offer in recent days,"I bought the book after reading positive reviews here. I do appreciate the general overview of the facts and opinions of the author after years of travel in this region under his belt.I have another travel guide, Wallpaper Copenhagen, to cross reference just what's written in this book about Copenhagen alone. I have not even been to Copenhagen, and already find this travel guide extremely traditional in its approach and narrow in scope for travelers. For example, no mention what the kids would like if you are traveling with family. Copenhagen over the years has been transformed into a very hip city which this book failed to portrait. Also not much on the focus of Danish design and architecture, what makes this country so unique. Disappointing! Now I have to buy more travel guides."
4,Norway in a Nutshell,"We recently returned from Norway and Sweden. We made good use of Rick Steve's ""Scandinavia"" to plan our trip. Along with related websites, Steve's free podcasts, and his blog with other readers' advice, we had a fabulous time. Thank you Rick!"
5,Rick Steve's travel books,We would never consider traveling in Europe without a Rick Steve's book after having been on four (4) of his tours.Rick's tours are the finest way to visit Europe if you really want to have fun and learn without breaking your pocketbook.
1,Not a very good product,I bought this iron for my Mother inlaw who is 92. The first time she used it a row of teeth came out in her hair. It did not stay in the iron.I told her to throw it away that I would find another brand for her. It is a junk iron. Not real happy that I had to buy another one for her...
3,OK,"I ordered this product because I had previously purchased an identical model. The new one seems to get hotter than the previous one, and I had burned myself on it several times before I learned to turn down the heat. Also, for some unknown reason, it doesn't work in one of my outlets that works for everything else. It's a puzzle. But I use it everyday and it does the job."
3,a little disapointed,"I agree that it is hard to find this kind of heating iron with the brush teeth, so I ordered this thinking it would be more up to date than the v. old slow-to-heat conair I have.well, this Helen of Troy heating iron is not any better than the old ones I have. it is sloooow to heat up !!! it also feels cheaper than my old versions. and although it has a plastic cap on the end of the heated part, it seems a little on the skimpy side and I would feel safer and less nervous if the protective cap was more generous. also, the teeth of the brush are rubbery, bendable...makes it feel even cheaper.All in all, I wanted to return it --- but then I realized that by the time I paid all the postage, I would only get $10 back. So I kept it. But seriously, if I had bought it from a store, I would have taken it back."
2,Not what I wanted,It is a wonderful iron brush but not what I wanted. This if for long hair and I have short hair.
3,helen of troy 1 1/2,"I've used a brush like this for 15 years and when it broke, I searched everywhere locally to find one. Amazon found one. It has its problems. The warm switch doesn't work, the tip gets too hot, and it does grab my hair at times. Bottom line is that it is the closest to the old one I could find and as for returning because of the defect, the shipping to get it here was almost as much as the cost of the brush. So I'll just put up with it."
3,Jumbo Brush Iron,"Satisfied with this purchase, but need to comment on the temperature. Once the iron heats up on the high setting, it gets VERY hot. Need to be careful not to leave it on anything that might melt or be flamable. Also, be careful as to how long you leave it in place on your hair (might burn hair and scalp)."
1,Disappointed,"For years I've been using a 1/2"" brush curling iron that works great. Recently they changed the bristles which use to be flexible and now they are hard plastic. They no longer grabs the hair and curl. So I've been looking for a new curling iron. I was disappointed to find this curling iron is made of the same hard plastic. These hard bristles do not grab the hair. I wish people who make these products would use them before they sell them. Anyone who would use a 1/2"" curling iron would most like have short hair. Try grabbing a hold of your hair with this hard bristle curling iron. Not worth the purchase in my opinion."
5,quick and easy,great for short hair.If you are pressed for time and want a quick curl-this is the brush for you.
3,tip is too small to hold,"Great curling iron for those looking for one inch barrel, but the very tip is way too small. The iron gets hot and you barely have enough room to hold the curling iron to direct it with curling your hair. Definitely needs a bigger tip."
2,Poor quality,I was not impressed with this brush iron. It has rubber bristles that made my hair frizzy. It does not get very hot. I have used cheaper irons that have had much better results.
4,"A bood, basic brush iron ...","There are no bells and whistles on this brush iron, but that suits me just fine. Brush irons are so hard to find nowadays that I was grateful to run across this one. It's well made, sturdy, and the price is right."
2,Disappointed,Very disappointed in this product. It doesnt get very hot and your hair doesnt stay in the bristles. Not sure what the problem is but the Conair Hot stick ones this is alot better & works great. I would not recommend or buy another one.
2,Curling iron review Helen of Troy,The Helen of Troy is light weight and easy to use but it takes a while to heat up. I will use it for traveling but will need a more substantial one for home use.HELEN OF TROY Regular 3/4 Brush Curling Iron (1511N)
3,curling iron,"this curling iron is too big for my hair (1-1/2""). I thought I would like it, but I don't. Why is it too hard to find 1-1/4"" curling brush wands?"
5,I love Helen Troys Iron Brushes!!!!!!!!!!!!,"""This is a very nice brush,perfect for my short hair,now I have 2 this mini 1/2 and the regular 3/4. I love them,good price and good quality. I recommend them 100%!! MiriamPD:Try them you will love them!""HONESTLY!!"
1,Do not buy..,"I bought this product but returned it because it BARELY got hot, not hot enough to make any decent curls. I honestly had to laugh because it was almost like a toy, so chincy and weak. Don't Buy!!!"
4,Great Product........but.....,"Although this curling brush is said to have a one inch barrel, it somehow seemed much larger than the 3/4 inch barrel that I already owned. It heats up quickly & does a nice job, but the tip that you hold on the end could be a bit larger. It also gets hot & can burn you if not extremely careful. Even still, I'm glad that I purchased it."
1,This curling brush sucks,"The brush doesn't heat up enough to do any good plus it is engineered so that you are holding it over the high/low/off heat setting and constantly shifting it. Not that it matters because it doesn't heat up enough to do any good. Plus there's no automatic shut off and the ""off"" position is between the high and low instead at one end or the other and so it's easy to forget and leave it on when you think you've turned it off. Basically it sucks and it's worthless. I would return it if it weren't more trouble that it's worth."
1,"Helen of Troy 1512 1/2"" Curling Brush",I have had this curling brush for several years and I don't like it for a couple of reasons. 1. It doesn't have a cool tip. It's hard to hold the tip without your fingers feeling the heat. 2. The tip has a grove in it. If the grove lines up with one of the brushes the brush has a tendency to fall out. I had 1 to fall out and it ended up getting broken. Now I have one spot that is like a curling iron and I have a tendency to burn myself.
2,Eh.,"Really, I didn't like it at all. Didn't heat up high enough, and the bristles are plastic and cheap. If I were to reccommend it to a friend, she would have to have really thin hair."
1,So not worth the money,"I want to say first that I only use hot brushes on my hair, for years I have used the Conair instant hot brush and I wanted to see if I could find one with a longer cord. The Conair is a great brush but the cord is thin and short. I purcased a Hot Tools brush and it was great although I need at least a 1"" diameter to use as I like to. The Helen of Troy brush is so cheaply made it almost looks like it is made out of one of the lids from a Starbucks coffee cup. The absolute worst, cheapest piece of poo ever. It takes so long to heat up that I never did see if it would get hot enough to work. DO NOT waste your money! I will go back to Conair until Hot Tools makes a larger barrel."
5,Best curling iron ever!,"This is truly the best curling iron. I have been a fan of the bristle curling iron for many years. Appparently I am not alone. Don't know why stores stopped selling them. That being said, Helen of Troy is the best bang for the buck. It's long bristles grab my hair very easily and the one inch barrel is perfect. Nice curls and not too tight. Very pleased with this product and highly recommend it."
1,I really need the 1-1/2 inch barrel of this,The product is fine I just need you to get back the 1-1/2 inch barrel. does Helen of Troy make this any longer?
4,good unit,This item was purchased by my wife she liked enough to purchase 2 more one for travel use and one for the country house
4,Be careful of the tip. It's HOT.,It's a good curling iron BUT WATCH OUT FOR THE TIP. They made that too short and you can burn your fingers if you are not careful. I still use it but I'm careful. Not for children! Wish it came with a glove or tip cover.
3,Really like it!,"This was a replacement for another one that I had, got old & would no longer work. I'm pleased, heats up fast."
1,Did not meet expectation,"This iron doesn't get hot at all! I have a Hot Tools 3/4"" and love it; however this one is awful. I have fine hair and it wouldn't even make a curl unless I left on my hair for a full minute. This iron is not useable!"
5,Hot tool,Love this hair tool. I you have long hair it make's great curl's.and heat's up fast. I do so many hair styles with it.
2,Ugh,"i really liked this brush but after a few uses it conked out on me. i want another one but will be returning this one. overall, when it worked it was great...nice large curl/wave....would like to see a smoother base, maybe ceramic as my hair can get stuck."
5,Hair product,I have had this product before and have been very happy with it. I just use it to turn the ends of my hair under after blow drying.
5,Ginormous Curling Brush,"This is a great brush ....I love it. It does exactly what I wanted. This size brush is very hard to find, so when I found it (and at such a great price too!!), I had to have it. It arrived in a very rapid time and I use it every day."
3,E.Blair,This Curling Brush Iron does ok. My hair is very hard to hold curls and when I use this brush the curls do not stay for very long. It does not get very hot. I think if the curling brush had a temperature setting would make it work better. This is not hard to curl hair.
3,Functional but not made to last,"Like several other reviewers, I have been frustrated at the difficulty in finding curling brushes in the stores these days, and I took a chance on ordering this one after reading the mixed reviews on it. For its price, it does the job, but compared to the curling brushes that I used in the 1980s, this one leaves a lot to be desired. Its plastic bristles and on/off switch are both pretty flimsy, and I'll be surprised if this one is still functional two years from now. (Note that the Conair 1/2-inch curling brush I purchased in 1988 still works perfectly and has no broken parts.) The tip is way too short, and I constantly burn my fingers trying to grab the tip, just like several other reviewers reported. It also takes a good five minutes to get hot.In summary, for $16, this isn't a bad deal and it will probably last for a couple of years. It's just much more cheaply made than the curling brushes that were so widely available at places like Wal-Mart 20 years ago."
3,Good Curling Iron BRUSH!,This curling iron brush is just the right size. The only thing is the bristles are so flimsy that you really have to be careful because they will cause you to get burned.
3,Doesn't work well,"First, I thought I was getting a hot air brush. This product doesn't work real well in my hair. It could be that I haven't mastered using it yet. It takes about 7-10 minutes to warm up. I always end up using a flat iron after using this product because I don't like the end result."
3,Curling Iron,"I like the way it works except for one thing - the rows of teeth slide out as you're using the curling iron, and did this the very first time I used it."
3,Several annoyances...,Pros:Heats up quicklyCons:The switch is flimsy and it is easy to turn off by accident when curling hairThe tip is pretty small so it's easy to get burnedHair gets caught between the metal part and the handle
1,Helen of Troy curling iron,"The brush part is too hard - the spikes should be more flexable, ball end, and a bit longer.Too easy for burned fingers and burned scalp."
3,Disappointed,"I have the 1 1/2"" barrel. The first one I bought was excellent but second and third different. Handle is too big and on the third one the bristles were half the size they use to be. Picture is not what I received!! Picture was the first one I owned and it was 5 Star. Think when I buy another, it will be different brand. Helen of Troy needs to quit changing the product!!!"
2,Wish it were larger!,"This isn't the fault of the iron, itself. It works just fine. Since the 1.5 inch Helen of Troy brush iron seems to no longer be made, I was hoping this one would do. Unfortunately, it is no replacement for the largest brush iron that used to be on the market. If you like this size, it will work just great for you!"
3,"Not what I was looking for, but it it will do:","This hair wand is rather nice in appearance and fairly comfortable to work with, but takes awhile to heat up. For medium long hair, it works okay, once it has heated up. It would probably work best for those users who have thin and/or thinning hair as it does not become overly hot. Nonetheless, it was the only 1"" wand of this type on the web. One has to take whatever is available. So it is okay, for now."
1,Not Happy With This Product,"Can I pick ""no stars?"" I wish I hadn't wasted my money, because this product does not have enough heat to curl my hair, no matter how long I hold it."
3,Great Customer Service ...product not so great.,"I loved working with this company! I let them know that the tip of the curling iron was just too hot to handle, and they insisted that I return it. GREAT customer service ...for that you get 5 stars (*****), but the product gets 2 (**). I would order from this company again."
1,barely heats up at all.,"This product is not good at all. It's such low heat that I can put my hand on the barrel and not get burnt. I do not have hair that is hard to curl- this just didn't do anything. Even after letting it heat for 30 min. I was going to return it, but after you pay return shipping, and the restocking fee I wouldn't have gotten any money back. So much for standing behind everything. I threw it away and ordered the Conair version from another amazon retailer. It was 1/4 inch smaller, but works really well. Go with that."
5,Words are insufficient,"I have read so many different romance books by so many different authors that when I picked up ""Wild Swan"", I expected it to be like all the rest. Needless to say, I was more than pleasantly surprised. The Swan trilogy brings so many wonderful, diverse, REAL characters to life. When reading these books, you feel as if you are part of the Carrington-Falconer family and wish you could be as honest and strong as the characters. So many different interwoven plots and so many different times in history serve as a rich background to this timeless tale. I will continue to read these books for many years to come and hopefully my daughters will do the same, as my mother did and as her mother did."
5,Celeste DeBlasis' Books,"I have read all of Celeste DeBlasis' books, and I too fell in love with her sagas. I cried, laughed, and lost sleep over the character's actions and troubles. Her books capture the reader almost immediately,and I would venture to guess that the reader finds it hard to put them down. I also suggest that a reader unfamiliar with her work begin with The Proud Breed, and move onto the Swan trilogy. I am still searching book sales for the hardback copies of her books. DeBlasis needs to write more sagas, and keep her devoted fans happy!!"
5,Enthralling start to a 3 book Series!!,"Wild Swan is the first in a series of three books about a family who move to Maryland from England and become involed with horsebreeding, racing and ship building.This books starts out in the early 19th century and ends in 1892. You wil fall in love with the many generations of Thaines, Carringtons and Falconers!!This is a must read for any historical fiction lover!!!"
5,Celeste DeBlasis is a treasure!,"I have read every book Celeste DeBlasis has ever written and I have loved every one of them, but the Wild Swan trilogy is my favorite by far! I still go back and read them about every two to three years or so. She paints such a rich tapestry of characters and settings for all of her books, and she obviously does a thorough job of researching the history of the geographical areas she writes about, you feel as if you are actually there. If you have never read any of her work, I would highly recommend that you begin with 'The Proud Breed', her first novel and my first introduction to her work, and then continue on with the Wild Swan trilogy. She has written other extraordinary novels, so find them and read them all. You are in for a rare treat!"
5,Late Breaking News From The Cosmos,"It is amazing that there are so many cosmology books being written, since the subject is so complex. However, Livio makes the subject compelling. If you haven't picked up a popular cosmology book recently, you will be astounded with the recent developments. This books is a great review of contemporary cosmological thinking. It is clear and compelling, without talking down to the reader. The author is kind enough to suggest additional resources if a particular topic strikes your fancy (or leaves you totally baffled). In short, a jaw dropper!"
1,Very soft and comfy but not worth the money!,I bought the Imse Vimse training pants after using the bummis on my 2 year old and the bummis are by far better and worth every penny! The Imse Vimse training pants are very soft and would probably work for a child who is pretty much fully potty trained with very few accidents. I would recommend the bummis for a child who is just starting to be potty trained. My child wears the bummis at night and his bed has stayed dry!!
4,Great buy!!!,These training pants have worked great for my two and a half daughter. Disposable training pants had put potty training completly out of her mind and with these she became aware once again about using the potty. It has been effortless. They also don't leak after one pee so I can change her if she has an accident and it is not a big deal. I really recommend this product.
3,OK but best to buy the set.,"No issues with the purchase or delivery. The only issue was as soon as I put it in the printer, 5 min later it wanted a new color replaced. Suggest you buy the set of colors instead of just one."
1,Dixie completely lost me...,"...when she referred, in this book, to Zen Buddhism as a ""cult."" Nice way to refer to an ancient religion, Dixie!"
1,Disappointment,"The author makes some valid points but then extrapolates beyond reasonable conclusions. I ended up laughing out loud when it became obvious that she labels anyone who has reached conclusions contrary to hers a ""radical extremist"". Oh well.... more toilet paper."
5,morrocan red clay,"great to make skin very soft and healthy looking. apply a thin layer so it dries on time. sensitive skin= 4 minutes. regular skin=8 minutes...if it makes your skin irritated and red after removing mask, dont worry... it will go away.great product! would recommend."
4,Good product,"Didn't use as much as planned , but used it in a past and liked it . Can be very useful , just need to find and time and get more organizedThanks"
5,Fun,This is a fun toy that won't take away much room and still holds their attention for quite some time.
5,"review on ""The Flaming Turkey"" by Robert Hitt Neill",This book reaches out to those who love hunting and the outdoors and to those who realize fellowship and family is really what makes this sport great. It is a funny and well written. Great book.
5,An incredible story- a real page turner,Jody Cramer has written a beautiful book about the shattering events of her son's tragic automobile accident that left him brain damaged. The story follows the over-welming difficulties that a family must overcome when faced with tragedy and heartbreak. The lessons learned from Jody's story can be applied to so many of life's cruel turns. She has opened her heart and revealed many unpleasant truths about the insurance industry. I highly recommend this book- an excellent read.
4,Fast paced action,"The book was written in a easy to follow fast paced action novel. It's not complicated. It's just a fun read. The suspense is good, the action well packed. The concept of a prison break out of this extreme, is of course, fictional, but that is what a fictional book is all about. To entertain us. Not to convince us it could really happen. I really enjoyed this book and the simplistic writing style of Peter Collinson. I look forward to his next book."
3,The Northeast Kingdom,"Great plot. Average writing. The escape is made too simple. There are some interesting scenes with the townspeople and the people at the Inn. But otherwise the book has average written all over it. I was surprised when one of the other reviewers statedthat this book was actually written by Chuck Hogan. When I read this book I thought it was actually written by a woman.Check out page 54 (paperback) ""Rebecca noted that the sage-green floral wallpaper matched the fabric of the seat cushions, and the lien"". Or page 57 ""sitting in a quilt-backed rocking chair with a china cup of blackberry tea...."" Does that sound like a male writer or does it sound like one of those cozy British mysteries."
3,Movie Plot,"This book was released in paperback form from a screenplay draft by author Chuck Hogan (here under a pseudonym). Fans of his will recognize an early character tie-in to Hogan's ""The Standoff"" novel - one of my favorite books - and therefore allowing me to forgive the obvious shortcomings of this story, since it was never meant to be published in the first place. The basics are there, and a lot better than most trashy stories, but not in the A-Class as the other 3 Hogan books are."
3,I guess it's ok for elementary but not that great!,"It's ok for the first year in Spanish for little kids like kindergarten and first graders. It contains common Spanish contents (house, kitchen, shapes, family, etc)"
1,Crystals too big.,The crystals are too large for my salt mill. The size of the crystals needs to be more clear. I have to crush them with a hammer before I can use them.
5,second time to buy,This is the second time I've bought this product. Works great in Oxo salt grinder. Adds great variety of flavor to food by giving foods different taste depending on how small the salt crystals are.
3,Expected More,Wish all the arrangements were done to completion. The rose arrangement was the most informative of the entire video. Don't think it was worth the cost.
1,An outside product should not rust!,"We purchased this product with the 8ft trampoline. The foam on the poles decayed to nothing and the poles themselves are all rusted! The knobs on the top that hold up the sides cracked causing the netting to continue to fall! We tried to get a refund for this product approximately a year after we purchased it, and were unable to, we even tried contacting the manufacturer who would not help us either. A trampoline is meant for outside use and therefore its enclosure should not waste away to nothing especially since the child who it is intended for uses it for therapy and is not aggressive with the product."
2,not fun,I didn't like this book. It takes forever to get to the point. I got nothing out of it. I am a returning student looking for studying help. I wasn't getting much out of my time. I spent to much time prepping to study than actually studying. I needed help and this wasn't it. Its a story of a guy talking to kids giving them assignments to help them out. The book talks more about the students and you really have to filter out material to get to the point. I couldn't even finish it. I had to get back to spending to much time making flash cards!
2,Not as advertised,The bands are great but the description stated that the kit came with a vhs tape which was exactly what i needed for where i would be using it. It did not come with a tape but with a dvd. So it's a little hard to work from pictures.
3,Not for me.,I've rarely used this product since I bought it. I don't think it offers enough intensity. Might be great for someone else but not for me.
3,Great product; bad packaging,"Although locked inside it's box, the bands arrived completely filled with dust, reason which I had to clean them before putting them to use. I would've rated the product a five (5), if it weren't for that issue."
3,"Product fine, slow shipment","Very slow to ship. Otherwise, the product is as described. Easy to use, easy to follow exercises included. I've not looked at the DVD just yet. Compact enough to carry with you anywhere. Great for the price. (Just need to get quicker on the shipment!!)"
4,Very Nice,I just received this product and am a first time user with the SPRI bands. I have to say i am completely suprised what a great workout they provide. I am coupling this with Jim Karas's Cardio Free Diet b/c his bands are just too expensive for my liking. The only piece of equipment that is missing is the leg band but the demonstrations in the traveling trainer exercise guide show alternatives to using the leg bands by using the regular ones. I love that this is compact not for travelling purposes but for anti-clutter purposes.
3,This is a kids' book!,"This is a kids' book! Well guess what, I had somehow missed that vital bit of information. If I'd known, I would never have purchased Totally Fun Things to do With your Dog."
1,Very disappointing,"Considering all the information and documentaries out on the subject of Frank Lucas and his Harlem Heydays, this one is extremely disappointing. Amateur and uninformative, this one was a stinker."
4,great movie,thi was a great movie and in the condition that the seller promised and recieved it in a good amount in time.
3,Poor display of mathematical formulae,I think that the Kindle needs its own version of LaTex in order to display the formulas clearly. The book has a lot of mathematical formulas that are displayed as images and not the best quality ones. The book looks a lot better when read in a PC monitor using the web reader or the Kindle App for PC. Otherwise I found the book very interesting the low score is because of the formula display.
4,Excellent read for those with an appetite,"This is a perfect book if you have had, at some point in your life, a rich math/physics training, and are hungry for the occasional meaty read. I was reminded why I went to physics grad school and not math. There were times where the wanderings of symbol pushing left me floundering. Quite a few times I found myself half way through a derivation, having forgotten what we were trying to get to. But it never made me angry or despairing. If anything it reminded me real mathematicians are explorers.The author very successfully mixes pure math, history, some biography, and some real physics. This is not easy. Agreed this is in no way an exhaustive treatment of any; but an exhaustive treatment would be 10 volumes, and then who would read it?As some reviewers have pointed out there are several mathematical errors in the text. But I have to admit that I found it thrilling to catch one myself.-Michael Clarage[...]"
5,Awesome Video Game!,"This game is very realistic, and I really like it! The batting stances, mostly look real, and the rest of the game play is cool! They have the exact uniforms as the big leagues. Most players aquired or signed by teams, are on that team! The only bad things about this game, is the fact that there is NO FRANCHISE MODE! The Season is good though. There is a 2 on 2 mode. That's were you pick your favorite batter and pitcher, from the team of your choice, and you go against another team. The score counts by different areas in the field. This is a great game, and if you are a die hard baseball fan like me, GET IT! LETS GO METS!"
4,Season Changer,"I haven't played this game, but my older brother has. Now, I have played the High Heat 2002, and I hear the new no one is much better than the current one, but they never changed the season! So, since he bought it in St. Louis, we can't return it. Other than that flaw, I think it is a great game."
2,Graphics ruin the game,I was about to buy this game until I actually played it at the store. The graphics were worse in this then in MLB 99 for the PS1. The gameplay was however pretty good and realistic. But insted of wasting 50 bucks on this buy Triple Play 2002 its a 100 times better.
4,I Am the ultimate baseball reviewer.,Here it is in a nutshell people.Gameplay= High HeatGraphics with less realism= All Star Baseball 2003Absolute [junk] waste of money= Triple Play 2002
1,Problem with Disc quality,"We purchased this game in high anticipation...and found that our PS2 system could not recognize/read the CD. We returned it for a replacement at a major retailer and the replacement CD had the same problem. I think there is a quality issue with 3DO's manufacturing process and I fear purchasing any more of their products because it is so hard to return games. Fortunately, the store agreed to give us a store credit to buy something else when we returned the second copy. Major bummer!!"
5,A Great Actress and a Great Humanitarian!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The Legendary actress and humanitarian Audrey Hepburn will truly remain in our hearts forever!! Audrey,we will alway's love and miss you!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Good Quality,"We use this 2-way in a medium size retail store (50,000 sq. feet) and it works great. The batteries last a full 12 hour day. There is ocassional static, but normally switching channels solves that problem. They've been dropped several times (on tile and carpet), but they keep on going. We've had them just over months and they still work great! I took off one star because the batteries take so long to charge."
3,lacks instant stopping power.,"good for the price and it looks very nice, but it lacks immediate stopping power. however, i ride a baron recumbent with most of the weight in the back, so that might be the problem."
4,Classic Pig,"This is a great Cd and a good companion to the Tull ""Living in the Past"" compilation released a couple of years ago. I just purchased it yesterday and, so far, have only listened to a few cuts. The ""This Was"" remake is interesting for many reasons, not the least being the fine playing (in my opinion it measures quite well with the original). In fact, the title of the album ""This Was"" completely fits the re-recording. The other album is a nice mix of reworked Pig originals and blues standards. I have not seen the DVD, but, understand it does not have recorded performances, only an interview (a shame, reflected in the 4, not 5 star rating). Not withstanding this ""possible"" disappointment, the set confirms Mick Abrahams as one of the great, if often unheralded (at least over here) British blues players. Well done Mick!!"
3,A very satisfying novelization of the Rosenberg spy case.,"This book is a fiction treatment of the Ethel and Julius Rosenberg spy case. The author gives episodic vignettes of major and minor players and provides a satisfying portrait of the time surrounding these events (and much later.)By using vignettes in short chapters, the effect was that of a nice tapestry. (Most characters were too shallow to follow in a straight narrative.)I had often wondered what motivated many of the foolish people who followed the Old Left. This book answered many of my questions.My only regret is that some character appeared too briefly. But all spoke with a chord of truth that I had not previously heard."
4,Great DH tire,"This is a great downhill tire if you don't mind the weight or drag. Excellent if you live close to a bike park since you won't be pedaling up. I weigh 225lbs and ride aggressively so, for me having a hard, fat tire with lots of surface area is more important than the extra weight or drag that the tire may bring to the equation. It grips ok in a variety of surfaces from hard packed dirt to deep mud.Great value compared to Michelin's ""wild gripper decent"" and they are basically the same tire."
3,Army Flag,"The material this flag is constructed from seems a bit thin, however, the price was right, the graphics are beautiful, and the shipping was quick."
1,Wrong item,"I ordered a ""U.S.ARMY"" flag. I received a ""U.S.AIR FORCE"" flag. Gave it to my neighbor who is retired Air Force, and didn't try again."
4,"Army ""New Sytle"" Military Flag",The flag came very quickly and the price was nice. No Shipping and handling was a great plus. On the down side the flag is only one sided. I have it hung outside for all to see and when my boy came home on leave.
5,Baby's wonder,"I have a stack of the Black and White books on hand to give to friends. It's great to see baby's start to focus on the black and white images, as baby's can see contrasts much better than colors (which are shades of grey for them for awhile)."
2,Book is ok but there are much better ones out there,"There are no words in this book, just pictures of baby animals. I purchased several other black and white books for my 2 month old son that were much better. A decent book, but would not recommend."
2,It's Ok,"This book is only ok. The images are interesting to my 2-month baby, but not as exciting to him asLook, Look!. The animals are nice, but they don't provide as much inspiration for conversation asHello, Animals! (Black and White Sparklers). Overall, ok, but it rarely comes off the book shelf."
2,Not Very Good Quality,"This book is nothing special. Very small and kind of flimsy. Cute pictures, but would recommend looking into other black and white board books before this one! Plus ours came slightly damaged!"
5,great black and white book,"Picture books without text seems so rare these days, but this one, aimed at the earliest readers (or rather listeners) is great. There are just the animal faces on each page and the black and white only colors are great for young eyes which are still developing. The pages are board book pages, so great for curious hands (and mouths). The animals are really cute and the book is only 10 pages long so perfect propped up for tummy time and letting your child enjoy the pages as long as they can handle/want to."
3,Good idea but lacking..,"I like the idea of this book, and it does seem to interest my little one, but it seems to be very thin pages compared to other children's books. Also, there are not enough pictures to compensate for the lack of words. Only 8 animals to look at, and you must make up your own stories as you go."
5,Finely-painted little portraits of human frailty,"The people who inhabit Lisa Glatt's perfectly disturbing but often hilarious collection suffer from a common human failing. They lie to themselves (and often others) and, in the process, they tend to lose grasp of their identity sometimes leading to tragic consequences. In all, Glatt's stories are finely-painted little portraits of human frailty. Often with dark humor and always with a sharp eye for detail, Glatt makes us think about the lies we've told ourselves and, at the same time, forces us to ponder whether, given the opportunity, we would be strong enough to face the truth. [The full review first appeared in The Elegant Variation.]"
3,Chatty but good...for beginners,"While it seems that many readers enjoy the conversational tone of this book, I found it to be frustrating. I didn't find the personal anecdotes to be that motivating, frankly. And some of them were downright boring (do I really need to be told that I can wear a watch while running to help me keep track of the time like the author does? Surely I could have figured that out on my own?).The suggestions for getting started are fairly simple and easy to follow, which is a plus. If you don't like reading much or just want a few suggestions to get you started, you might like this book. But you are looking for solid research, a wide variety of opinions and viewpoints, and detailed information about starting a running program, you might want to check out a few other books."
4,Enjoyable and Inspiring to Read,"I enjoy the book, alot! I enjoyed how she shared her personal experiences, making it more real for me to relate and not so technical. I also found the book to very motivating and inspiring. There's a few words of advise the author gave that I always think about when I run. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is beginning to run or considering running."
3,Solid advice but outdated & a little uninformed,"I just got this book today and finished in an afternoon. While it was enjoyable, and a good start for a beginning runner, there were a number of things that I found troubling, such as the author's anecdote of how she ate nothing but junk food to power her marathon (after earlier chapters on how running = healthier bodies) and especially her views on hydration (""you can never drink too much water""). Unfortunately, in recent years, that has been proven gravely untrue-- runners, especially female ones, have collapsed or even died from drinking too much water on a run and not replenishing electrolytes instead (losing too much salt & overhydrating the body).All in all, a solid & encouraging introduction to running for a beginner, but Reber doesn't go into detail of the more probing questions of running I had, which included hydration and when/how to eat (she discusses them in very light detail, but once again, her views seem a little uninformed)."
4,"Lots of good geology, but not enough PTr event","I enjoyed the history of geology and especially thehistory of establishing the Permian age itself. Iliked the thorough discussion of the Russian sites,but as a geoscience professional I am probably moreinclined to this than the average reader. There wasalso a good discussion of the KT event (that wiped outthe dinosaurs) and several other extinction events.My gripe is that when he finally got around to the PTr(Permian - Triassic)event, he basically explained whycertain hypothoses were not good, but didn't reallygive a strong hypothesis of his own. Maybe that isbecause the evidence is not good enough to have a stronghypothosis, but the title is misleading in that case.Overall, I recommend the book as a history of geologyand the Permian specifically, but don't expect to comeaway with a real answer."
3,Not the book that it claims to be,"While interesting enough, ""When Life Nearly Died"" is not what it claims to be. Most of the book is actually an overview of the study of the PT extinction, not actually looking at the causes or effects of that disaster. When the book finally does veer, haphazardly, into its subject, it becomes quite interesting, but the reader has to wade through miles of Geology 102 to get there. The author's final thesis takes up only a few pages, and there's little discussion about the mechanisms or defenses of his theory.In the end, the author devoted too little time to his actual subject for this book to be worth purchasing. It's well written, sure, but I read the book to learn more about the actual PT extinction, not about 19th century South African geologists."
2,"Long run, short slide into the Jurassic","There are lots of interesting facts and stories in this book, and eventually they are assembled into a theory on the cause of the end-Permian extinction. First, though, we learn a lot about nineteenth century geology from a European, primarily British perspective. Then we learn a lot, a whole lot, about other extinctions. Finally, we get a rather tentative, politically correct proposal for the cause of the end-Permian extinction. The author even quotes Al Gore.Fortunately, the author writes in a relatively readable manner and knows well the many subjects he presents . The graphs and illustrations are well done and complement the text. I just wish the book were shorter and more direct or that the author had split it into two."
2,Specialized vocabulary,"The author hangs on to too much specialized knowledge and vocabulary for this to be interesting enough for general readers.I was looking forward to a being led by an expert into a new area of knowledge related to geologic timescales. But I couldn't find much of the excitement that you often find in equivalent popularized science discussions by experts in astronomy or physics for example.I think the potential is there, but this was not the author for it. The author however is clearly capable, competent, well-informed.If you remember the times when the neighbor kid went on for hours about his rock collection and you liked it, this book is for you.Meanwhile, I'm still looking for the author who will open the door for me to geology and other like topics."
2,What a rip off,"This has to be one of the most expensive, smallest capacity ink cartridges on the market. I go through three of these for every color cartridge. The C64 may have a low price, but the ink is a killer. I'm donating the printer to the Goodwill and saying goodbye to Epson. I can't afford this high cost of printing. And generics clog the nozzles."
2,"Paid less, paying more","I have paid more for the black cartridges in 3 months than I paid for the printer. I think I will do what one other person suggested and donate this printer to someone or a charity. My HP, which is 5 years old is so much better."
2,Get the Larger Capacity Black Ink Cartridge,"Skip this low-capacity black ink cartridge for the Epson CX6400, and go for the high-capacity cartridge (available at other retailers). Average price is $35.00, but prints almost twice as many pages (800+)."
5,Works great!,The cartridge came on time and was in great working condition. I will buy this one again in the future. The price is right and the quality is perfect.
4,not too many copies from it,"this seemed to not last very long - I bought the name brand replacement thinking it would last longer, now I wonder if the generic ones would do much worse for the money - you can probably get the generics for 1/4 the price"
1,Shame on Epson - Many thanks Amazon,"I bought my Epson Printer CX 4600 last yr. thrilled w/ it, (and the price) because I was using mostly color. However the ""thrill is gone"" now. My experience has been exactly the same as the other reviews, only I thought I had done something wrong when the brand new black ran out and after cleaning the nozzels the color was gone, and it didn't tell me which color I had to replace. If I hadn't seen these other reviews I may have taken it into my repair place and spent a bundle tyring to find out why....Too bad we can't send these ""all in one"" reviews to Epson. Thanks very much for the forum.."

5,Get a little taste of the First Coast,"What a good mix of new poets, well known Floridian poets, young, old, a true taste of NE Florida...whether you are from Florida or not you will enjoy this delightful anthology and bios of the 54 poets. Winner of a 2004 Royal Palm Award. Internationally recognized in Poetry Now Magazine the most read poetry magazine in all of Europe. ""Open Mic Jacksonville"" was also placed in the archives at the Cummer Museum of Arts & Gardens as part of Jacksonville, FL history...to be enjoyed 4 ever...It's a treasure. Get one today!"
2,Disappointed,"My copy was grainy. I couldn't hear the songs clearly. I love the Andrew's Sisters. I suggest getting their other Christmas CD. It is much, much better!!!"
5,PG-13,"I just got this book and I'm writing on my experience last night, when I began reading a story to my daughter. In the course of three pages, a woman was cut up ""inch by inch starting at the feet""; a man's head was cut off; in hell he was tortured with ""molten bronze, the iron rod, pounding, grinding, the fire pit, the boiling cauldron, the hill of knives, the forest of swords""; as further punishment he was reborn as female; as a child, she fell into a fire and could get ""no relief from the pain""; later her husband smashes her baby's head against a rock.Browsing more today I haven't found anything approaching that level of violence, just my bad luck perhaps. The stories are fascinating, and the introduction is a wonderful explanation for Taoism and the tension with Confusianism that is reflected in this anthology."
3,Not as good as the others.,"This book is a part of the Pantheon Fairy Tale and Folklore Library. I've collected four others, but this one is definitely not as good as the others. It's shorter than the other volumes and there are a lot of stories that are more like proverbs. These wouldn't be as bad if the majority of them weren't so short. If you're a lover of the Chinese culture or want a complete collection of the Pantheon Fairy Tale and Folklore Library, then get this. If not, then you may want to skip this one."
2,There Are Better Collections,"As a devotee of Chinese folkore and literature I was disappointed by this collection. The retellings were wooden and lacked the graceful flow that all well told fairy & folk tales should possess. Many of the stories are taken from Pu Songling's ""Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio."" Moreover children and parents may find some of the stories in this collection both morbid and cruel and not of a ""cuddly"" nature. I would encourage both adults and children to look elsewhere for a better, more approachable collection from the rich Chinese tradition of imagination."
5,Chuck Knox - winner in football and life....,"Chuck Knox worked his way up from the poor steel towns of Western Pennsylvania to become a top coach in the NFL for over 20 years. Laced with interesting anecdotes and great humor throughout, this book not only shows that hard work and desire can lead to the top, it gives common sense advice on how to keep your head about you when you get there. For any fan of the pro game, but especially the Jets during the 60's, Rams during the 70's, or Bills or Seahawks during the 80's, this is a must read. All of your favorite players from Joe Namath to Brian Bosworth are covered. I would think that this book is almost required reading for any ambitious football coach, high school or otherwise. The wisdom and common sense approach Knox used in dealing with the multitude of personalities involved in team sports could apply to any level of athletics. Chuck Knox never won the Super Bowl as a head coach, but was always a winner- in football and in life."
4,great book,"a fast read, exciting. I was a little disappointed with the ending, but it is worth reading."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book because the front cover review compares the author's writing ability to Robert Boswell, Russell Banks, and Richard Russo, 3 of my favorites. However, Breaking Her Fall lacks subtlety and emotional resonance. It is a story told in a very flat, almost unbelievable, way. It is unclear to me how the Chicago Tribune reviewer could have thought such a comparison possible. Every book I have read by the 3 R's lives on in my thoughts because of the deep connections made by the characters. Goodwin's book, alas, is plot driven."
4,Loved the first 3/4!,"Breaking Her Fall's main character is a flawed man who knows it. He's a single father raising two children with an out of town money/status-hungry ex. He gets himself into a spot of trouble while searching for his daughter who is not where she said she would be. As the parent of a daughter just a tad older than the daughter in this book, I felt Tucker's actions were a bit over blown and obsessive. He has not learned to trust himself and so defaults to 'testoterone dad'. This book was a terrific read for the first 3/4 of the way into it. Then I felt the author kept repeating the same conversations/fatherly musings/ and themes. I had to make myself finish it because I had so loved the beginning I wanted to wrap up these characters and see their happy ending. The daughter/dad final 'coming to terms with what had happened' set in nature conversation seemed contrived. I felt as if it could have come 100 pages earlier with more succinct writing. All in all a good book."
4,It really sticks with you,"I read this book over six months ago and still think about it. Mr. Goodwin does a superb job of developing the characters in this novel. I felt that over the course of the novel, I really began knowing the intimate details and feelings of both father and daughter. Mr. Goodwin writes with complete sensitivity. I look forward to his other works."
2,Title was compelling...,"...and the book started out pretty good; I found the synopsis intriguing; however, overall I found BHF to be tedious and the characters unsympathetic.I didn't care for the way the children were allowed such disrespect in their words and actions toward their parents, and I was disgusted at the way the parents were portrayed as total patsies to their children.Even worse, I thought that the main character's (Tucker) disinterest in holding the boys who violated his daughter, a mere 14-year-old child, was unrealistic and reprehensible. I find it completely unbelievable that there would be a man out there who would not want to see predators such as these brought to some kind of justice.I was relieved to finish this book. Besides the above criticisms, I found it to be far too wordy due to several sub-plots that were unnecessary and distracting."
2,allow him to digress--and digress--and digress,After reading reviews (it's difficult to find ANY book on this site that has a general rating of less than 4 stars)I was eager to read this book and I really did want to like it. Thank goodness it only cost me a trip to the library. The author mentions one thing then gets sidetracked to something else then something else until the original point is totally lost. Since I was only able to endure 17 pages I'm giving an extra star on the off chance that perhaps this book got interesting somewhere along the way.
2,Eh,"I didn't really care for this book, and that surprised me, because I've read quite a bit of Jodi Picoult's work, and she covers the same territory -- parents dealing with a teenaged child they no longer understand. For some reason, I never felt sorry for Tucker. I felt like there was a lot of skimming the surface."
4,"Short, sweet and to the point.....","Although not a very big book, I found the information in 'When in Mexico' very accurate and very helpful. It was good to get some inside 'tips' that could save some embarrasment or hurt feelings when traveling in that great country, such as what time to arrive at someone's house for dinner, when it's not ok to haggle over prices, etc. The format of the book was kind of interesting, but it was still an easy read."
2,um... not scary,"This book was not scary, like all the other ones, I think they were just trying to find an easy way to end the series, the series was good but the end was a BIG let down"
4,"Could not use, but service was great",I ended up not being able to use this product b/c of my computer but the person I bought it from was great about returning it and quickly processed my refund.
5,"Great software for, young or old.","In my opinion 3d Movie Maker is possibly the best thing to come out of Microsoft since Windows 98. This game is alot of fun to play with, its also super easy to use. Orginally, this program, was designed for children...But if you google search ""3dmm"" many things will come up...Including films, props, actors, and other expansions...ALL downloadable for FREE!This game could keep anyone entertained for hours. And if I where you I'd grab a copy quick, the game is getting harder to find even across the internet.Have fun filming!"
4,A very good game,"This is a very addicting way to make movies. It's limited, but if they ever come out with a second version, it will be probably no better or worse than this. Making movies has never been so easy, or inexpensive!"
2,woody pet costume,the costume was missing the badge and the hat material is not stiff enough & won't hold the shape of a hat.
2,Broken on arrival,order with plenty of time to send back it was cracked bad packaging or the ups driver was playing soccer
2,not for me,"I really dilike these strings, i have always used nickel wound regular light gauge and have liked them much better than these. These are rough and have a tone i dont want."
3,I want to Like this,"I want to like this magazine. In fact, I do like this magazine, except for the many many ads. There are ads on almost every page. There are full size ads, small ads, business card sized ads.The pictures are lovely and the cover almost always draws me into the magazine. There are some interesting articles about this fascinating state I live in, and I am always interested in what they have listed inside. However, once I start reading it, I'm always frustrated trying to find the articles in between the ads.This magazine has always had a lot of ads but lately it seems to have even more than normal.I won't subscribe to this magazine for that reason."
2,New Mexico magazine,Editorial and picture standards are not what they used to be - but it is still a good magazine on a great state.
1,NOT for the Epson Stylus CX4600,"As of today, September 25 2012, Amazon's utility ""Will This Work With Your Printer"" says that this works with the Epson Stylus CX4600. It in fact does not - it is too wide. This is likely a type-O situation, because it is actually made for the CX6400. Understandable, but frustrating to have to return and then buy a true replacement. It's a little difficult to print a return label from a printer that needs ink."
1,amazon is crazy! this ink is not suitable for Epson CX8400!!!,"Amazon is crazy!This ink is not suitable for Epson CX8400!!!WASTE MY MONEY AND TIME!!Tpying letters With ink on my hands, can't wait to write a review!"
5,Great value!,"Spending a little extra for the high-capacity cartridge is a no-brainer -- it is a much better value. I would never use off market inks on my printer, it can screw it up and it's not worth it. Plus I love the fact that this Epson Durabrite ink is waterproof.Amazon had the best price out there, including online merchants, office supply stores, even the warehouse stores. Very fast free shipping too, 2 days. Can't beat it."
4,CX6600 High-Capacity Black Ink Cartridge,The high capacity cartridge is the better choice. Offten more black inkis used than color.
5,High-Capacity Black Ink,Love the larger size......since you go through so much more black than any other color.
5,EXCELLENT PRICE FOR PRINTER HI-CAP INK CARTRIDGE!,"Epson T043120 (T0431) High Capacity Black Pigment Based Compatible Ink Cartridges by LD ProductsI have always bought my printer ink from Costco, thinking they had the best deal. When Costco didn't have the high-capacity black cartridge online, I discovered Amazon had it at $10.00 less--and this is the real thing from Epson, not a knock-off brand. I have a color inkjet, and also found they have a 10-pack which will save me over [....]. I will be buying my ink from Amazon from now on!"
3,Not a bad price...,"I'm glad I found this product online and didn't have to pay the average price for it because it's not worth it.It would be nice if Epson or the makers of this ink would find a solution to the clogging problem. If I don't use my printer at least once a week, the ink gets clogged and I have to run the ""cleaning software"" and waste half the ink to get it to print properly.Not a cost-effective product."
5,GREAT INK RESULTS,I love epson products and buying them here online was a lot cheaper and quicker to receive. I love my amazon.com. It's great for electronics and refills for them.Ms. De of GA
2,A double-edged sword,"On the one hand, the Dura-Brite formula produces printouts that are resistant to the sort of smearing that ink jet output in known for. On the other hand, this same formula may be what has forced me -- and many others, according to the reviews I've read -- to trash the C84 ink jet printer. Many people, myself included, have found that said printer suddenly stops working because of clogs that can't be unclogged, and one widely accepted theory is that this ink has dried to such an ultra-hard consistency that it has gummed up the works beyond all repair. So if you have an Epson ink jet printer that's still working, just be very careful to follow all recommended precautions to keep it working -- and keep your fingers crossed. If you're trying to decide on a printer, I can't recommend Epson and this Dura-Brite ink."
5,Epson Dura-Brite STYLUS C84/C86/CX6400/CX6600 High-Capacity Black Ink Cartridge,"Best Bargin I Can Find!!!!! High quality ink cartridge, fast shipping, and at the lowest overall price! This is the only place where I will purchase my ink cartridges."
5,"Hand-sized book, Russian is in Cyrillic, good value.","It is extremely difficult to find English/Russian/English dictionaries that help with pronunciation by also providing Russian words in non-Cyrillic text. Therefore, this dictionary is as good as any. It is small, however, and hard to read without strong magnification."
2,"Does not charge all at ""once""","Although this product is very nice, I feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect. To me the words ""charge all at once"" means that I can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall. However, this is not the case. This item is simply a method for organizing you devices. Although it is a nice idea, it is certainly not worth the $34.99 I paid, and if it wasn't a gift, and Christmas wasn't 3.5 days away, I WOULD return it. I feel that by using the words, ""charge all at once"" they are purposely misleading the customer."
1,TERRIBLE design,"I was really excited about this charging station, but the reviews are all right on target. It is terribly designed. The back compartment only fits a very short power strip, and you do really have to jam it in there. However, the short power strip is only long enough to fit 2 traditionally shaped AC/DC converters - ie the ones that are too wide to fit into adjacent plugs. If you're thinking that's no big deal because I have the slim kind of AC/DC converters that CAN fit into adjacent plugs (like for your bluetooth earpiece), HA! The back compartment of the station is too narrow to fit those converters. The only real option is taping the power strip to the outside of the station. We'll be returning this one and opting for something more functional."
2,would not recommend,Like everyone else I didnt realize this DOES NOT have the charging piece needed.Needless to say I have not purchased one to fit it so it is NOT being used.
3,Charging station - 4 pod,I like this product. I looked at many different charging stations to find one that had enough room for 4 phones. This works nice on my kitchen counter.
2,Faulty ink levels,"I checked my 'empty' cartridges against one another, and they vary considerably in weight; I contacted Epson who confirmed the levels are based on use rather then actual ink level; additionally, even though I print B&W; 99 percent of the time, even on the 'economy black only' setting my colors get used up; customer service stated that was because the printer uses all the colors even when 'black only' is selected. Bottom line, Epson's system is not environmentally efficient, as it wastes a lot of ink.That said, the ink and cartridge itself are mostly pretty good, though expensive (so they should be)."
2,Dried differently than expected,"Since it's called 3D Glitter Glue, I expected it to come out thick with glitter and dry raised up. However, a minute after application, the glitter began to sink down and spread out because the glitter is thinly suspended in the glue. I tried to make thick dots of glitter, but they dried as weird unevenly-glittered ovals that just made the paper soggy and wrinkled. I had bought Crayola Pipsqueaks glitter glue before this and was hoping to find bigger tubes of equally awesome glitter glue, but was disappointed. I've tried a few different types now, and nothing compares to the Pipsqueaks :/."
3,"Great glitter, but tops don't stay on","My daughter loves this glitter glue. The colors are bright and they do pop. My one complaint, and the reason for only 3 stars, is that the tops (where the glue comes out, not the caps) pop off and they will not screw or push back on, which leads to a mess and to the glitter glue drying sooner than it should."
3,cannot empty the containers,"Pretty, but wasteful. Cannot empty the containers fully. the colors are bright and great, but you have to squeeze out the glue."
3,nothing exceptional,"It's glitter. But is it glue? I assumed that being by Elmer's that these would serve as glue pens too, but they are pretty much just glitter gel for decorating. They don't seem to adhere two things together.It says that the designs POP up when dry. They don't, it just depends on your original thickness. If you use a lot, it's going to stick up. The colors are great and true when dried.The output on these squeezable pens is a bit much, hard to control, especially for a little kid to use. Alternatively, I put some on a paint palette and that worked better to use them in gobs with paintbrushes. BTW, old makeup brushes (especially blush and foundation brushes) work great for toddler/little kid painting, better than cheap kid paintbrushes.(If these had a brush tip they'd be much better!)"
2,3D it is NOT!,"Bought these for my grandsons so they could make cute drawings and while it comes out of the tube looking raised and 3D-ish, when it dries (which takes FOREVER) it is barely a bump on the paper ... plus they are drawing on stock paper and it wrinkles it as it dries ... can't imagine was it would do to standard 20 lb bond paper!"
5,Fun!,"My 5 year old daughter loves these! They are excellent- don't dry out, easy for her to get the caps off and back on by herself, colors are bright and are just all around fun for 5 year old crafting."
5,LOVE THESE!,"My toddler loves these! He wasn't crazy about art projects until I picked these up. And the colors are so pretty they bring out the 12 year old girl in me, so we both have fun. These will definately be a staple of our craft cabinet."
2,More like glue,"When we purchased these washable glitter paint pens, we were under the impression that they were pens for coloring. In reality, they work more like a glue. My daughter uses them to glue paper."
4,Amish Life,"This is a interesting picture book that teaches children about Amish life. On one Amish farm, a stroke of lightning hits the barn, and it burns to the ground. The next day, the whole Amish community gets together to raise (build) a new barn. The are so orderly and prepared that it makes on wonder, how often does a barn burn down? It is an educational book for kids that shows a community coming together to help each other."
4,Touching Story,This book is a touching story about an Amish community which pulls together to help each other when a family is in need. It is a wonderful book to help teach children the meaning of community and our role in that community.
3,rohn is one hell of a player wiht a voice that soars,"this is a easy cd to get into if you like jazz or mellow style r&b. the man guitar style is as gentle as the summer night. but rohn can also get down and funky with those strings chek out it all in you or brown sugar, sweet nadine is my favorite. rohn is the bigman with the gentle touch."
4,All-Out Action,"What a ride! ""7 Deadly Wonders"" kept me hooked from page 1. I don't typically read action novels, but I love an archaeological mystery. Reilly has put together a totally unrealistic premise, action that makes you think ""Oh come on..."" and an almost preposterous story....and I was loving every minute of it! I couldn't read it fast enough. Think ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" meets ""24"" - great action, booby traps, gun battles, ancient relics. This was my first Matthew Reilly novel, but definitely not my last!"
5,Matthew Reilly Strikes Again,"Wow! Another amazing read. This is just as fast-paced and action-packed as all of his other books. Just when you think he's completely run out of new material and he can't possibly come up with something new. Wham! You get a book like this. An absolute treat to read, it's like a Jerry Bruckheimer film in print."
2,Screenplay for a Video game,"I think Matthew Reilly might have wanted to model his work after Tom Clancy's success in turning books into video games, which is not a bad idea, but I think he jumped the gun and wanted to shoten timeframe by writing a video game screenplay and try to package into a book format. I loved all of Reilly's earlier books, although unbelievable adventures, they were rooted in reality, this book however tries to present video game type sequences where the gamers have to brave all odds to get to the prize, which doesnt work as a book. Totally disappointed in the book except for few scenes in Paris."
1,Give away at the Library for some youngster!,"I started to read this drivel last night on New Year's Eve and after one chapter had to stop, as the writing was so poor, the last minute 'saves' were so contrived...I thought I was back in Doc Strange land,and that does a disservice to Doc Strange!It's going to the Library tomorrow to go on the 'give away' shelf for someone else to read, probably will suite any of the game scenario players out there that may also happen to read!"
3,Reilly is Dropping his Past Writing Standards,"Instead of getting better as a writer, such as Ice Station and Temple, Matthew Reilly's unfortunately is really getting stale.And from the opening of this latest novel - that can't get any plainer. Obviously just wanting to give only Hollywoodish-type action sequences, with no solid grasp of storytellng and rich characerization, there's no 'wonders' in this novel.And I'm an action book/movie fanatic! I'm the prime target audience he should be shooting for. Instead, Reilly has unfortunately take to the teen population in gaming-style prose. If a gun and muscles gets you to win the day, and that's all you want out of a good read - then I suppose this is for you.Not for me.Giving this 3 stars is being very kind and gracious."
1,"Good idea, Badly written","The idea behind the story is very good. Had it been properly written this could have been a dynamite, can't put down book. Unfortunately it reads as if it had been written by a middle school kid. As another reviewer stated, I too found myself counting exclamation points. The dashes and italics I could have done without also.I hate to ""quit"" a story so I did suffer this all the way through, it was after all an interesting premise. I had never read anything by this author before. I don't think I will read anything by him again."
1,Worst. Book. Ever,"This could possibly be the worst book I've ever read, and I've read ""The Last Templar."" The story is so stupid that you want to gauge your eyes out; the writing style is worse than that of a twelve-year-old; he uses exclamation marks like there's no tomorrow; and the characters are so flat you could build a card house out of them...Avoid at all costs. You have been warned.Read James Rollins instead."
2,Worth avoiding,"Sometime ago I read Ice Station by the same author. While it was definitely outrageous, it was still fun and inventive. This book is really neither. I don't think there is an idea in the book that isn't ripped off from somewhere else. Badly drawn diagrams of the various locations supplement the bad prose.The traps and the ways the team figure out to evade them is sort of like reading a narrative of someone playing a videogame. Activate the disable bullets gadget, jump left, dodge the oil, hit the ""Call Falcon"" button, jump over the crocodile, snatch the little girl before she's scalded by hot lava, and so on. Since none of the characters have any depth and the story itself is silly, reading this book quickly becomes a chore."
4,For entertainment purposes only,"First off this is not the next da Vinci Code. It tries to be in some ways but it isn't. The writing style isn't the best, I'll admit, but its a pretty entertaining book. I found it hard to put down and the charts and maps really helped. The whole trap avoiding thing was pretty interesting. There were a few problems with suspension of disbelief. Personally I think they should have kept that falcon out, its a pretty stupid concept. And the evil colonel having no nose was a bit much, but like I said, it was very entertaining.If you liked the da Vinci Code or Angels and Demons, even though this isn't as good, you will still enjoy the book. So in a nutshell:Cons: Character development for only a few people; some corny stuff like the trap-disabling falcon; using italics for every other word; and lots of exclaimation points.Pros: Interesting plot; certain aspects like the technology and traps were quite original; visuals really helped; and it keeps you hooked."
3,For God Sake Take Longer Than A Week To Write A Book!!,I think matt wrote the first half of this book in a day then decided to do some research. Trying to keep up with his fly by the seat of your pants image is destroying his ability to write a truly brilliant book. The second half of this book on the otherhand i found great good story the usual impossible save the day but if you can get past the 747 Helicopter there was almost a good plot and story line id love to read a matt reilly book that takes me into the book instead of feeling that i have just skimmed over a story
2,Where the heck was the editor?,"I'm all for suspending disbelief and I enjoy a good little mindless adventure. It was a lot of fun reading through a book with non stop, albeit slightly silly adventures, sort of allows ones brain take a little holiday. That being said, though, I spent the larger portion of this book wondering where the heck the editor went. I mean wow! This book makes a bigger use of exclamation points than I've ever seen! It's sort of like having a conversation with an excited 11 year old girl! Lets not forget the liberal use of italics! Just in case the exclamation points didn't get the point across well enough! Let's hear it for enthusiastic writers! It was similar to reading a story written by my eleven year old daughter! Actually, I was a little disappointed in the book! I usually really enjoy Reilly's books, but the editing of this one drove me...well..crazy!! Okay, I'll stop with the punctuation now...! (Sorry had to do just one more..)"
2,A Disappointing Novel,"Reilly fans will probably find his latest novel to be quite a disappointment. For some reason, Reilly forsakes all the things that made his earlier books great. Instead, this novel is a thinly disguised political statement which reveals Reilly's prejudices against various governments and religions. The plot is obviously borrowed from ""The Da Vinci Code"" and the characters are one-dimensional pawns whose main purpose is to verbalize Reilly's personal ideology. For the first time in a Reilly book, I managed to finish the book out of sheer determination rather than out of any interest in the plot or characters."
1,It's been a while I haven't finish a book,"In The Netherlands I payed 19 Euro for this intriguing title. I like adventure and this sounded like the right one.What a disappointment. I kept reading after the first chapter just because I haven't got anything else to read.After the 747 landing on a golf course and doing some VTOL I gave up.You can compare it to some cheap tv action series that you always ask yourself ""who would watch that?"".The bottom line is don't waste your time and money on this book."
2,This makes Clive Cussler look like a literary genius!,"At the risk of sounding like a literary snob, I must say I found myself embarrassed to be reading this book. I also must admit I had to quit it half way through, but it also forced me to write my first review. I have eclectic reading taste, and once in awhile I like to read a ""turn off your brain"" novel, ala Crichton, James Rollins and the like. This book however, is so over the top comic book bad that it had me laughing! You can only have so many hairs breadth escapes and non-stop action. Nothing in this book is based in reality. If you are looking for a little bit of character development, and some kind of realistic plot don't look here. My son gave me this book for Christmas along with ""Map of Bones."" If you are looking for an action packed thriller that still has some plausibility I recommend you try BONES!"
1,The greatest wonder is that it got published,"I gave up after the guy jumped off the cliff onto the back of the croc to save the little girl. I kid not you. Reilly wrote that and I did give up. I figured anything was better than wasting more time with Reilly and I didn't even pay for the book.Fiction is, well, fiction, and a suspension of disbelief is often part of the deal. However, Reilly's ""plot"" is really more like a bad cartoon. He makes the most recent, worst James Bond movies seem like documentaries.Is it possible this was supposed to be a comedy?"
4,Typical Reilly fare,"Ludicrous to the point of silliness, yet still entertaining if you can suspend your sense of reality and disbelief when you open the book. That's ok though, I do most of my reading for fun, not for highbrow Pulitzer wannabes or Oprah book club tripe. Works for me."
1,Thanks for the warning...,"I am currently reading this book and, at page 54, was tearing my hair out.This book has been writen for morons. The tiny little paragraphs, the itallics, the exclamation marks make this a very frustrating read.I actually commented to my husband this morning - it's like a computer game that you read instead of play!Thanks for the heads up - it obviously won't get any better so I won't be investing any more of my valuable time on it."
2,Disappointing,"This is a great plot for a good action movie, written by a capable screenwriter. However, as a book, it was lame. There was little character development to the point that you just didn't care about the heroes or the villains. The choppy writing was difficult to adjust to and it was hard to get into a smooth flow. Frankly, it could have been read at one sitting but why bother. I can't recommend it."
3,"Yes it's Anti-American, get over it.","My complaints about the book, which are few, stem only from the overuse of italics and exclamations marks every few sentences and a few truly unbelievable plot points. The book was very much written to be a movie and it shows in the complicated descriptions of settings that require multiple diagrams in order to understand how these underground caverns are laid out and how the booby traps work.Yes the book had a decidedly anti-American bent but guess what, that's reality. America has been the world's only superpower for quite some time now and we really haven't done anything truly noteworthy or altruistic in a very long time. Imagining America as some sort of galactic superpower with dominion over all for 1,000 years would be a truly frightening prospect. I wouldn't want us to have that kind of power, either.But overall the book is what it is, a fast-paced action book that is an easy read and fairly enjoyable."
3,Video Game,"I am a huge fan of Matthew Reilley's works, to describe whom as ""action-packed"" would be an understatement. Off late, his works have become something like that famous opinion of a savant regarding the telephone directory: ""all characters, no plot""; only in Reilley's works there is nothing but absurd action. Question is, in spite of all these being said & done, why do I award three stars? Because to escape the ""ennui"" there is no easier & cleaner alternative. So Holmes may have his cases & cocaine (or both), let's have more of Scarecrow or Jack West."
1,What a joke!,"Quite simply the worst book that I have read in the last 10 years! My wife gave me this book as a birthday present and I only finished it to please her. I am ashamed to say that I reside in the same state of Australia as the author and if his writing style is indicative of the educational standards in this country, then God help us all. Within the first 10 pages I was sick to death of the story, the illustrations and the never ending ""bangs!"" and ""resounding booms"".I absolutely cannot believe that this guy is a best selling author....it is beyond comprehension.This story belongs in a B-Grade comic book and is an insult to all good authors."
1,One Big Chase Scene In a Universe Where Physics Doesn't Apply,"OK, I only made it halfway through the book. This is unusual, but it happened. I wondered if I was missing something and then checked Amazon's reviews. It looks like everyone else is experiencing what I was. All chase, no (real) plot, no character development, and way far too removed from reality for me. Reilly has a 1% understanding of physics...I gave him credit for realizing that dropping something would cause it to fall to the ground. Look, you can't make an 8 ft wingspan human glider powered by compressed air. F=ma just won't work....think about it. Aluminum is not affected by a magnetic field...not even kind of. I doubt that bullets contain a significant amount of iron to be affected by a magnetic field....no way. The total disregard for physical laws just drove me nuts. Being on the hairy edge of plausibility...OK, but this was beyond laughable, it was just plain annoying."
3,pale print - good book,"I left a paperback by a pool in Niagara Falls, NY after reading half of it. I was interested in how it would end...so I checked Amazon and could get a copy for 19 cents...sound too good to be true? perhaps --of course the S&H; was the usual $4+ but even then...I got my book -- I took slowest shipping, so it took awhile, but it got here OK. I enjoyed reading the book -- but I wonder whether the reason it was cheap was that it was poorly printed. Some pages the ink was so faint I couldn't read the pages unless the light was good and my glasses were excellent. Other pages were fine...I got my book and got it read...but I wonder whether the book was so cheap because it had a print defect...I'll probably never know...Seven Deadly Wonders: A Novel"
1,Just plain stupid!,"Perhaps that best describes me for even finishing this book. All US bashing aside this ""story"" is ridiculous. Miraculous saves left and right as this band of idiots travels around the world destroying ancient artifacts. Entire tombs are found in hours using ancient scrolls that apparently are available to anyone. Magma and boiling mud active for thousands of years, flowing through hidden passages triggered by elaborate traps, the likes of which would defy any current day engineering. Self-deploying awnings (made apparently from unobtanium) used to divert lava carried in the mother of all utility belts. Stupid from beginning to embarrassing end. I'm embarrassed to say that I have read other Reilly novels and even enjoted a few but this will be my last. Without a doubt THE worst book I have read."
1,Worst Book Ever,"Save your time and money. This is the first book I have purchased written by Matthew Reilly and I can assure you it will be the last. Without a doubt, the worst book ever written in the history of literature. I wish I could have my money and time back I spent on this book. It should be placed in the children's section of the bookstore, but that would be an insult to 5 year olds. Mr. Reilly should consider another career suited to his talents, maybe greeter at Wal-Mart!"
1,hard-cover video game,"7 Deadly Wonders is typical of Reilly's writing style, all ""whiz-bang"" action and adventure with an attempt at putting a storyline in there somewhere. I enjoyed his earlier books, a guilty pleasure, I admit, but this one I simply cannot defend. The science and history behind the story, the benben stone of the great pyramid and the seven ancient wonders of the world, are flimsy at best, and laughably ignorant at worst. Obviously, little or no research was done beforehand and what research is evident seems to come from excessive playing of tomb raider and viewings of Indian Jones. I quickly grew tired of his ""... at exactly the same time.."" and ""just as..."" style of action, and it rapidly loses any sense of reality. Reilly disapoints because he actually does have a talent for creating an intriguing story idea, but simply does not have the skill or talent for putting it on the page."
5,Seven Deadly Wonders,"As with all of Matthew Reilly's Books,(from the first one i read to this one), is an excellent read. It is the type of book that is hard to put down, at least it was for me.Though the title is not the original title. The original title here in Australia is Seven Ancient Wonders and is the first book in a trilogy (so far) with a lot of the same characters in all 3 of the books.The other books are The Six Sacred Stones and The Five Famous Warriors.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story."
3,Dilemma,"I really enjoyed the historical parts of this novel, BUT rest of the plot was just ridiculous. For people who have certain expectations of this book, forget about it. Though I rate it as a 3-star out of my fondness of the historical plots, this one is not recommended."
1,Don't Bother!!!,"This book is an absolute waste of time and I usually love reading this genre. It seems like the author used a checklist to write the book rather than developing any characters or background. ""The group worked their way past several more traps"" is an example of the type of writing you will see here. Read Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child or James Rollins for any well written action thrillers."
2,!!!!!!!!! --- count those.,"Again, I saw the title, read the plot summary and got excited for nothing. This book was truly painful to read. Hence my not finishing it. Now, as I hope, many of us pay attention to punctuation and how it is used. It affects the message trying to be sent and I think most of us read a sentence and do so in the way the punctuation requires. Let's try:""She broke the back of the chair.""""She broke the back of the chair!""""She broke the back of the chair!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""They are all different. There were WAY too many of those !! in this novel and in places that did not need them. The worst part is that this book was so complex, that there were diagrams aplenty to NOT aid you in understanding.I dunno anymore."
2,what was he thinking?,"Up to this point I have been a huge Reilly fan. I disregarded the customer reviews and bought the book. I haven't even finished it yet and now I'm sorry I did buy it. After reading ""Contest"" I was expecting a really great read, but I am very disappointed. Reilly seems to be using the book as a political opinion format and bashes the United States. Since I spent my money on the purchase of the book, I will finish it. I agree with other reviewers: He uses too many exclamation points and one line paragraphs. The character development is just not there. He took a wonderful concept and threw it away."
1,Pachinko,"This is one book I put down - no way I could finish it. There are no characters in the book; no point of view; no empathy; no plot; no purpose; no accurate history; no believable scenes.The book caught my attention because I love ancient history. My first instinct was not to buy the book, but the premise held some promise - how bad could it be? Well I found out. I felt throughout the third of the book that I managed to plow through that I was riding a ball in a pachinko machine (even the diagrams added to THAT effect.) Where was it going and what was the purpose?The use of history is non-existent. The descriptions are laughable. The only suspense is - will there ever be anything worth reading in the book? Resetting traps --- from 2500 years ago? Characters that disappear and reappear.Boring - totally. A waste of money and time. The back cover was a better read."
3,Loved it,I liked it for what it was...and I couldn't put it down. Did he use exclamation points too much to make a point? Yes. Was there a bit too much descriptions? Yes. But I really really liked the book. Enough so that I am going to look at his other stuff. New concepts...creative...descriptive and I could tell he was really really into wanted to tell an action story with heart and enthusiasm. Great job.
1,Reilly!,I felt the entire time I was reading a book written by my 10 yr old nephew.My first time to read a Reilly book...and most likely my LAST!
2,Breathless writing - not necessarily a good thing,"Reilly's imagination is certainly fertile. His protagonists get themselves into the stickiest situations one can imagine, and, assuming you can suspend all possible disbelief, always manage to extricate themselves with a maximum of demolition and destruction. However, Reilly's writing frankly is jarring, and never allows me to become absorbed in the story. He is overly fond of exclamation points (outside of quotes), breathlessly throwing them about where better description would more appropriately serve the reader. He cries out for an editor. Each novel reads like a blockbuster movie script, for which you must be willing to leave all common-sense at the ticket counter in order to enjoy it. Some might find this just their cup of tea."
3,I for one LIKED this book!!!!!!!,"I cannot believe what snobs commented on this book. I bought it because of the subject matter, which deals with the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. I realize a contemporary writer has to convey emotions, mood, etc., through punctuation. What do you think an exclamation point is for, anyway? It is a fun, light read, with interesting plot twists. And it is hard to describe a lot of action in writing. This is a certain genre, which many of it's commentators on here failed to check out before they started reading. Their fault, not the book's! There is little characterization, granted, but I don't want to KNOW a lot about these characters!!!!! The characters are not supposed to be characterized! It is an action-oriented novel!!!!! Gee whiz! What did you guys want, Marcel Proust?I am thoroughly enjoying this book. If you decide to read it, just don't expect it to be more than what is is. And don't be a snob if you are going to read pop fiction. ;-)"
2,"Great Theme, Lousy Book","This is the first negative review I've posted, ever.I picked up this book because the theme of the 'seven ancient wonders' is extremely cool -- and I've read other books by the same author in the past, so it seemed like an instant winner. Wrong.This book is a dud - I stuggled through the shallow plot, predictable outcomes and less-than-thrilling scenes in the hope that something would improve. Although there are glimpses of a potentially decent book, the author failed miserably in the delivery.Clearly, this is the worst thriller I've read in the last five years. Sadly, I must recommend that you skip along to the next book on your list."
3,would've preferred as a movie,"I only gave this book only three stars because I didn't feel that the writing captivated me. The author told you what was going on, but it didn't create atmosphere or emotion...for me at least. This is a book that I probably would have preferred as a movie. The story was super cool and interesting, but the writing just didn't do it for me.Indiana Jones is a great movies series, but I probably wouldn't have enjoyed reading it as a book. This is the feeling that this book brought out in me."
4,I Really Enjoyed it!!!!,"This is the first book I have read by Matthew Reilly and I liked it. I have been a Clive Cussler fan for several years, and this book gave me a nice break from Dirk. I found it full of action and a nice light read. I really like the idea that like Clive he throws a good bit of history into it. Now I will say if you are one of those that live and die by the reality of every minor detail you might find a few things farfetched, especially if you served in the military as I did. All in all I am now a fan and will probably buy the next book. I took away one star Only because the Kindle edition does not have the text to speak enabled. When I travel I like connecting it up to the car speakers and listening to it while I drive."
4,Great book with lots of action,This book is all action from the first few pages until the end. Like all Reilly books the action will keep you turning the pages. This is also the first of a series of three books which are also great. If you liked the scarecrow series then you will also love captain west. Check it out.
4,Couldn't put it down,"First book I've read by Mr. Reilly, but was pleasantly surprised. From the very first page, all the way to the last, the author keeps you enraptured and wondering what was coming next. Buy it and get ready to be entertained."
1,Put it in a comic book,"At one time I enjoyed reading a Matthew Reilly book, but after forcing myself through half of this one, I began to wonder if someone hit him on the head, causing a loss of writing ability. I had to put it down once I hit the 100th time he spelled out the sound of a machine gun...RAT-TA-TAT-TAT!!!!!! (or something close to that).Note to Matthew: If this is going to be your writing style going forward, please learn to draw and put it in a comic book.Note to editor: Grow a pair and exercise some control.Note to Publisher: If this is all he can do, don't waste the paper to print it, unless you also publish comic books. HOLY RAT-TA-TAT-TAT BATMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,7 Deadly Wonders,"After looking forward to the release of this book, I was somewhat disappointed because Reilly portrays the U.S. as an evil country bent on world domination. I had a hard time getting through some of the paragraphs because of this. If the reader can ignore this and remember that it is fiction then I believe he or she will enjoy the book. 7 Deadly Wonders is definitely a page turner."
1,Like reading a bad video game,This must have been written to please teenaged boys who live to play violent video games. The first chapter is so silly and unbelievable that you wonder how it could get much worse....and then it does. Don't waste your time with this drivel unless you have an IQ below 65.
1,Sucked,This book sucked. I got to about page 300 before I decided to check what the reviews on it were. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. This is the first and last Reilly book I will read.
5,Poor George,"I had just spent the summer in the dentist's chair. I found this book in my granddaughter's library and thought it would be perfect for my dentist and his waiting room. It was a gift to thank him for his gentle and successful treatment. Poor George, how he must have suffered with his terrible teeth."
5,Must read for C&NW and Steam enthusiasts,"If you've always wanted to know what it was like back in the day's when steam engines ruled the rails, this is thee book for you.Goerge Williams takes you on a lovingly painted pictorial of his Father Buddy Williams, a C&NW engineer. Follow his career from it's humble start as a fireman to humiliating the deisel at the end of his career and the steam locomotive itself.You will find yourself rereading parts of it again and again."
3,gulliver revisited,THIS IS A FASCINATING LOOK AT GULLIVERS TRAVELS....BOOK IS IN GOOD CONDITION BUT SMELLS LIKE A BASEMENT. PERHAPS DAYS IN THE DESERT SUN WILL HELP. I AM HAPPY WITH THE BOOK AND FEEL IT IS WORTH THE MONEY.
3,so soft,"I actually bought this as a joke to show a friend (it was 99 cents) because of the name but I needed a conditioning treatment so I decided to go ahead and use it. I was actually pretty nervous about putting it on my head because I was afraid it would look or smell weird. There was no need; it's white like regular conditioner. It smells sickly sweet, though. I don't think I'd use it again just because of the smell.Results: My hair looks pretty much exactly the same as before, but it feels really nice!"
5,Recommended,"I love this product, it's the best remedy for my frizzy and dry hair out of everything I used before.Just noticed that the color of dyed hair fades much faster. But still, it's a small price to pay for a healthy looking hair."
5,life saver!,"I've tried a million different hair products, and this product has been the only thing that's been able to salvage my dry (chemically-damaged) hair. I managed to snag one of the packets at Walmart for less than a $1. The smell is a bit overpowering, but it's fantastic product. You really should use the entire packet as well - which if you have long hair (I'm a guy, so one packet is more than enough) you might need to purchase more than one."
3,umm ... interesting,"So Writing New Media wants to be a wake up call. It wants to instill shock and awe into teachers of writing and shake up the system. Only, as an instructor of college writing who has grown up with teachers who already brought ""new media"" into the classroom I as more annoyed than satisfied by the tone of the book.The tone made me extremely angry. I felt like I was being attacked as I read the first 60 pages of the book. It wasn't until it was discussed in my graduate course that I realized I was angry because this tirade wasn't directed at me but at the ""old school"" teachers. I already bring in new media and mixed media into the classroom because I am of the generation that thinks NOT bringing it in is friggin boring.There are some good notions at the end of the book, and the end of each essay ends in ""in classroom exercises and activities"" which are probably more helpful than the essays and tirades."
1,Horrible quality,"I'm the publisher of SteamyKitchen.com and specialize in Asian cuisine. This is by far the worst wok I've ever purchased. It's expensive, cheaply made. I would not recommend at all. I decided to return it within 30 seconds of opening box. You can feel the cheap quality just by lifting the wok up."
1,the worst product ever purchased at Amazon !!!,"I have been purchasing stuff from Amazon for 3 years. It is _the_ WORST product ever. The quality of the wok is so terrible and crude that I can not even imagine using it. The discription of the item is totally puff!Do _not_ trust what you read!I have purchased other wok and kitchen wares that made in China from local stores and they were all fine, but this seller's product is really really disappointing! I just wasted a big chunk of money! Down to the drain!"
5,Excellent graphics!,"This game is by far the best video game I have ever played. Took me a while to beat and I am still working on getting the S rank. If anyone is looking for an action game that has blood and gore, this is it."
5,Pretty Sweet,"This game has it all! Sweet graphics, good plot, plenty of action, visually entertaining (eye candy), and challenging. You have to use your brain and master moves to advance. I didn't like it at first but after I got the hang of it I didn't want to stop. Too bad I have to go to a friends house to play."
1,Thank God I didn't purchase this!,"I rented a copy from [a video store]. The commercials looked cool, most of the reviews I read were favorable, and I liked the theme etc... Then I loaded it into my console and attempted to play. The controls are difficult to get used to and not at all intuitive and you cannot customize them at all. The story is very broken up and I was disappointed to have some of the screens where the player is ""in contol"" be so simplistic (goal: walk across room). The graphics were still pretty good, but as far as I'm concerned, that's all it has going for it and it simply isn't enough to keep me interested."
3,"Hard to Play, Graphics Overrated, Average Game at Best","I anticipated this game highly as most reviewers said that this game with incredible. Well it was incredible -- incredibly average.The controls are so ridiculous and tiring that even an experienced gamer has a hard time maneuvering as well as trying to fight while at the same time ""stealing souls"" Halo has exceptional controls, this is just plain terrible.The graphics are nice, if you like pre-rendered graphics... nothing is real time as far as graphics go, your character can't jump (just what kind of samurai is he?), and he can't do things like walk up stairs!He can't do that because the background is pre-rendedered... and except for some slight movement, its static and doesn't change.If you want a good game, stick with Halo and avoid this unless its on sale."
5,"lovely, touching, beautifully written","I loved these stories. They are sad, and full of life, and don't make empty promises to the reader. Beautifully written, lovely, and touching. I look forward to more stories by Ms. Kane"
5,Recommended all the way,"I have found this book to be of enormous help in finding and winning scholarships. What separates it from any other book out there is that it doesn't just offer common sense tips, but really takes you step by step through all the insider stuff. I recommend this book all the way."
5,"$16,000 in scholarships and climbing!","This book helped me win $16,000 in scholarships, and the scholarship winnings continue to build. Yeah, I probably could have won some of these scholarships without reading the book, but the book made everything so much simpler and showed me exactly what I needed to do. The essay section itself is worth many times the cover price as it helped me turn unsuccessful scholarship essays into ones that seem to be getting results. That section was also really useful for writing college essays and school papers as well. Overall, you can't go wrong by getting this book."
1,Do not get this book if you are a grad student,"I have been researching ways to find grad school scholarship money, and this book was not helpful. The author did give some helpful tips, but they were mainly common sense strategies. This book is aimed mainly for high school students, so I do not suggest buying it if you are looking for money for grad school."
1,Completely useless and condescending,"As a senior with ok grades applying to college, I found this book completely useless. The author assumes that you have a background at least as good as his, and constantly peppers his book with annoying ""you can do it"" encouragement. The fact is that if you are applying to Harvard, which is his alma mater (which the author shamelessly advertises on the front cover), you don't need this book. If you are simply a hard working student with good but not great grades, don't waste twenty bucks (like I did) on what amounts to a self-congratulating biography."
2,Misleading,"Kaplan is very misleading about the actual odds of getting large scholarships. Lets say that the average 600 SAT student has about a one in ten thousand chance in getting a given scholarship. This book will improve that student's odds to about one in eight thousand. You decide if this makes sense.After watching my daughter bust her tail on scholarship applications and seeing the outcome, the one thing anyone needs to know is to go after all the LOCAL scholarships."
1,You can do better than this book,"Talk about a self-absorbed author who calls himself the ""scholarship coach."" After many applications sent out based on his techniques, I haven't won any money for college. He had the great grades and activities to get into Harvard, so he thinks that he has learned the ""secrets"" that other less-stellar students can copy. To sum up how I feel about this book, I returned my copy and thankfully got my money back."
2,Need more ethnicities,"Let me know when this comes in brown skinned or other ethnicities. My son is asking about body parts and differences between boys and girls, but we need matching skin colors in order to make a purchase."
5,My 3.5 yr old LOVES this puzzle!,"He got it from Grammy recently and he has NOT stopped playing with it. We haven't done a lot of education re: anatomy, but I know it will be wonderful for that as well. Great quality puzzle as well. Totally recommend it!"
5,Great Puzzle!,My 3 year old son received this puzzle as a Christmas gift from my sister. He absolutely loves it! He loves to take apart the little boy to expose the skeleton and has lots of fun putting it together.
5,Good film!!,"I loved it, very heartwarming-moving film! All should buy and watch!!! Informative in teaching one about the differences in gender orientations!"
2,Why put it on film?,Did not like it at all. My fault. I should have read more about it before I purchased it. I refused to accept it as reality.
3,A Lesbian Movie From the Black Perspective,"A nicely written and acted tale of a 17-year-old girl by the name of Alike who goes through the hardships of being a lesbian teen and dealing with her ongoing homelife. As a black lesbian I'm happy to see there is a black film aimed in a serious way on a LGBT-subject without comic relief. Adepero Oduye, an actress I never heard of until this film, challenges her character well in this heartfelt role. Kim Wayans, someone who most of us grew up laughing at thanks to 'In Living Color' also plays the overprotective mother of Alike and also deals with a struggling marriage. Though this is a slow burn movie, the storytelling does a good enough job getting it's point across. I liked it and hoped many will be open in taking a look at Pariah.Rating - 3.5/5"
1,Self-indulgent tripe,"This book should have been subtitled ""Everything That's Wrong with the Baby-Boom Generation."" Read it if you're interested in: endless rationalization of horrid, self-involved behavior; willful disregard for the emotional health of two little girls; and self-righteous religious fervor (but only when it's convenient, and only the parts that don't require any work to follow). CLEAVING nauseated me in about fourteen different ways."
2,"Covingtons Betray Readers, as Well as Each Other","These Covingtons are skillful writers, but the tale they tell of betrayal and compromise, self-indulgence and thrill-seeking is a self-serving one masquerading and soul-cleansing confession. No matter how carefully you spread their behavior across a grid of pop songs, psychobabble, scripture and contemporary sociology, it still amounts to a single conclusion: these people are good at constructing fictions. This so-called breast-baring is just another one of them, casting seriuous doubt on their ability to write non-fiction with any genuineness of purpose."
2,Not very good.,Their fist CD (self-titled) is their best CD. I would recommend this as this is not a very good CD. Seems to be trying to hard to sound soulful but fails in every way. Made me want to skip each song until I ran out of songs!
5,LAUGHS BY LIEBOWITZ,"Treasures are supposed to be rare, and the scarcity of Liebowitz' ""Social Studies"" makes it prized and hoardable. OK, the stereotypes are there. If nothing else, Liebowitz and Robert Burns had the same idea - to see ourselves as others see us - but Liebowitz makes us laugh. As she wrote - sarcasm is what New Yorkers have in place of Jacuzzis. My dog-eared copy of ""Studies"" is one of the treasured tomes in my reading library. I always know where it is."
3,interesting,"Hearing her speak in person, or in the film ""Public Speaking"" is a different experience.Fran's expressions and timing are hard to translate from reading the text"
2,Not a real VGA box!!!!!,"I bought this thinking that it was a real VGA transcoder. But it is not, it's a scan doubler that does not support HD resolutions. All it does is convert a normal TV signal to a vga signal which comes out horrible on a monitor. Everything it very blurry and the colors all bleed, resident evil, a beautiful game looks especially horrific. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!! For about 20 bucks more you can go to www.vdigi.com and get a real vga transcoder that supports HD resolutions and higher refresh rates and can also be hooked up to anything that support component cables. This piece of junk is going right back where it came from."
1,P.O.S ALERT! !!,"This thing is a P.O.S!!!! I bought it for the PS2 from petra, all I got was an audio signal. Tried 2 different monitors, and hooked it up too the tv Nothing. dont waste your time or money on this junk. F'n POS !!!"
1,lolwut,"""PLAYS ON A VGA MONITOR SO THE RESOLUTION IS SEVERAL TIMES THAT OF A TV""Sorry, what?!Uses all caps so it's more true!I wouldn't trust it."
3,Only has four seals.,Need to label it better. I only got four pieces when I needed eight. Who changes four valve seals ? Common guys.
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I purchased this sight unseen because I love Bobby Jones, thinking that this would be and instruction book as if Bobby had written it. But that was not the case.There are some very nice photos of BTJ, but most of the book is about Ben Crenshaw, whom we are told has a swing very similar to Bobby's, kind of.Good photos, not instructive. Disappointed."
2,Unreadable,"I'm not sure who this book is written for. Although at some points the author assumes the reader to have little knowledge, explaining the basics of what DNA is (together with a half-hearted attempt at a diagram), by then he has filled 20 pages with phrases such as ""eluctible holism"", and he immediately afterwards starts talking about the ""ligation of 3' to 5' phosophodiester bonds"" and the size of the ""human immune repertoire"", without explanation.The very first word of the book - in the title of the first chapter - is ""Prolegomenon"", and it's not a teaser to be explained later, you're supposed to know what that means.It's very frustrating because the content is very interesting and the arguments well thought through, but the author makes me work so hard to try to follow them that I cannot enjoy them or be certain that I fully understand them."
3,More hand waving than substance,"I was disappointed by this book. Kauffman's work with cellular automata and his bookThe Origins of Order: Self-Organization and Selection in Evolutioninspired me to go to graduate school and study complexity theory. I was excited to read Investigations, hoping it would sum up all of Kauffman's research in an insightful way. I gave up reading it about 1/3 of the way through because it seemed like he had spent the first 100 pages talking about how amazing and unifying his ideas were without really providing the ideas to match to bluster.I have found that much of Kauffman's research is immensely insightful and a decade to two ahead of its time. However, this book gave me the feeling that his ego was a decade or two ahead of his research."
4,one of the better molding tools,I've owned three of these. my only real problem is that over time the folded edge snaps off. they need to make the tool stiffer so it lasts and has more prying strength
3,Make sure you get the right volume!,"This book comprises two volumes that bear the same title but are sold separately. Vol. 1 (1329 pages) is devoted to Prose, Vol. 2 (698 pages) covers Poetry, Criticism, and Drama. Make sure you you don't get the wrong volume as I did!!The book itself wears its 20 years well and for its breadth of coverage continues to be very useful as a general survey of modern Japanese literature. The three (and a half) stars are because the author's own voice tends to flatten the rich and varied body of writing the book treats, making it sound deceptively homogeneous."
1,Hickenbottom Sued Her Homeowner's Association,"I read it and wept. What a load of nonsense. This woman sued her Homeowner's Association over a mold issue and has the nerve to write this book?Thje best part is, that all her friends reviewed it and gave it 5 stars. Take a good look. All the 5 star reviews are done by people who only reviewed this book and no others. Coincidence? Please.The book is a fraud, just like Hickenbottom. The HOA queen and an industry beneficiary who makes money from all this stuff.David, a HOA living person who never sued his HOA over mold."
1,If I did not get this for free I would ask for a refund.,"Being that I got my copy for free from a personal friend of mine at the CAI, I really hate to complain.But being an expert on HOA's through my personal experiences and triumphs, I must state that I could have done a better job reporting the issues.All in all, a good attempt, but next time a little more research and fair and balanced reporting.Thanks Jan"
5,Most Helpful,As an on-site community manager I purchased this book as thank-you gifts for Committee Chairs for their voluntary contributions to the community. All recipients found it insightful and very helpful. Homeowners do not always understand there are laws governing HOAs and Ms. Hickenbottom's every-day examples with answers and solid solutions are helpful educational tools.
4,a reliable battery,There's not much to say here - this battery does the job as well as the OEM battery supplied by Olympus and costs a lot less. What's not to like?
2,Bad Bussiness,"This package came in with corner cut out and rubber boots in a small zip bag. Top it off one of the rubber boots were the wrong boot, so I had to go to local parts store to find the right boot, because didnt want to pay for return shipping! Anyway I dont recomend this seller to anyone! They advertise new and you get open used product!! On the plus side the package got here fast!"
1,Does not fit,"I have a Kenmore model 116.31912 upright vacuum cleaner and the owner's manual says it uses a part no. 20-86889 hepa filter. I bought this filter and it does not fit. It does not look exactly like the picture. The lines of glue in the picture are closer to the edge on the filter I received, and they line up with plastic tabs on the vacuum cleaner that make it impossible to insert without modifying the filter or the vacuum cleaner. I chose to cut out the glue on the filter, but it is difficult to do that without puncturing the filter media. I don't understand why other revues mention seller Dirt Killer when this listing is for seller Crutial Vacuum. Incedentally, Crutia Vacuum is printed on the filter which gives you an idea of the level of quality control. I have no confidence that it is actually filtering tiny particles."
5,filter,"works good it blocks all allergens and dust balls really well and its easy to install, I would recomend this filter to enyone that needs to replace their filter"
2,NOT THE SAME FILTER AS KENMORE ORIGINAL,DIDN'T TRUST THIS WOULD FILTER WITH SAME EFFICIENCY. VACUMN IS EXPENSIVE AND DECIDED NOT TO CHANCE IT. SENT IT BACK.
5,Better Price Then Sears,We have the Kenmore Progressive vaccum. This filter fit in perfect and is much cheaper than buying it at Sears.
5,Works the same,"This fits the vaccuum the same as the manufacturer filter and it seems to filter the same as well, I don't smell any dust or anything, so it works just the same for a fraction of the cost!"
1,not Kenmore,"this filter is NOT ""by Kenmore"", it is made by EnviroCare Technologies made in china. It has thinner filter material and less folds. I can't tell how well it works(filters). You may find it acceptable for the price, but it is not a Kenmore."
2,Too loud!,"I had to return this fan as it was just far too loud. It seemed to be an okay fan other than this one problem, and it would probably be a good choice for a large workroom or garage, but I bought it for my bedroom. It's the same size as the fan I had previously, but this Honeywell fan is so loud that it actually kept me awake at night.Incidentally, I was able to determine that the noise is due to the shape of the fan blades themselves. Indeed, under product features it says: ""Powerful turbo wind generator blades move more air than standard ""pedal style"" blades."" Turbo wind generator blades... yes, it did rather remind me of an airplane engine.I plan to buy another fan with the larger, rounder blades instead."
3,Can you say L O U D!!!!,"My first impression was how nice it blends in with our decor. I like the black color. I put it together in about 5 minutes and plugged it in. The thing was LOUD. I thought I had it in HIGH setting. NO. It was in the LOW setting. When I put it on high, the fan almost got knocked backwards. It's very loud too. Now, if you can sleep to a constant fan noise, then that's fine. But if you need whisper quiet, don't spend the money on this fan."
4,"Great, solid, relatively compact fan",This fan is great and comes with a remote. The breeze function is a little distracting for sleeping but I like using it when I 'm reading.
4,great fan,"Great fan for the money. Love the remote control, turn fan on/off, change speeds from across the room. Just the right amount of noise for sleeping. Only negative is that the breeze feature has a harsh start up, but not enough to be annoying. I would definitely recommend to other people. Was told it would not be shipped for at least a month but was able to get within days of ordering."
2,Not that great,"It wasn't that great, the remote controller felt extremely cheap and the fan is too loud. They should make quieter ""low"" settings. Returned it and got a much cheaper one from Wal-Mart."
4,Honeywell remote control stand fan,I had purchased this fan 3years ago and was completly satisfied with it. So I finally purchased one for our bedroom. When there is no need for the A/C we use the fan with great results. I soley recommend this product.
3,Really works but is noisy!,This is a well made and easy to assemble stand fan. It is also very powerful but even on low it is very loud. This fan is best used in a room where you are not sleeping.
3,I LOVE / HATE THIS FAN,"There are many well written reviews about this fan so I won't repeat in detail what you have already read. This is a very good fan that moves a tremendous amount of air, the lowest speed feels like high. To accomplish this the fan blade is very narrow and looks like an airplane propeller. The downside is it is extremely loud. The fan velocity is so powerful it would probably take off if you put wings on it. I had to turn the T.V. volume up quite loud just to hear it. I was ready to return it but found a solution. I purchased this fan because the Lasko fan that I had been using died. I put the wide Lasko fan blade on the Honeywell and it completely solved the problem. It didn't move quite as much air but it was dead quiet. This probably won't help you with your buying decision. You're not going to purchase this fan knowing that there is a loudness problem with the fan blade. Honeywell needs to correct this. My advise is to keep looking."
3,OK for the price - but cheap feel,"I think this made in China fan is decent for the price, but I was expecting a better build. I guess I was expecting too much. There's a lot of lightweight plastic involved, and the fan knob that holds the fan blade in place is also cheap plastic. I stripped it a little by trying to screw it on CLOCKWISE then I read in the directions that it screws in COUNTER-CLOCKWISE, so beware. As for noise, even the low setting does seem a bit noisy but for my use it's not much a problem. My main concern is the durability of this fan. Overall I give it 3 stars as an ""OK"" fan for the price."
5,Excellent,"This fan excellent Has many pros -1. Very high speed and wind flow. In fact, it's nearly a trouble that even at lowest speed it's so fast ...2. Remote is very handy, and stows on the fan if you want.3. Has timer: you won't find that on cheap fans.One con I guess is that the stand base unit is not very well attached to the top. So you have to be careful when moving it around."
3,Just OK,This fan is not all that powerful.It is OK at best. Easy eneogh to assemble just not that powerful
3,It works...,"The fan works just fine and the remote and timer are nice features. However, this fan is very very loud! The low setting sounds like the high setting on most fans and it is a bit stronger than what low should be. The breeze option is more annoying than anything. It seems to work by turning the fan on and off... I guess because a breeze isn't constant? This would probably be fine - maybe even nice - if the fan wasn't so loud! So the fan gets soft then loud, soft then loud. It is not a feature I wiil ever use because of this."
1,Quit after 2 weeks,"Our fan quit working after only 2 weeks. Honeywell directed me to talk to the vendor, but the vendor refuses to replace either the fan or our money. I recommend that you stay away from fans with touch pads/electronic controls. Reliability is not good.Honeywell HFS641P 16-Inch Remote Control Stand Fan"
3,Does the job,"I never have really owned a fan before, so I cant really compare this fan to other fans. Well as the previous reviewer stated it got this breeze mode which is quite odd, It starts to spin real fast than uber slow, but it gets really annoying. Fan is also really loud but oh well, you get what you pay for."
3,Good but a little loud,"Everything about the fan works fine, except my only complaint is that it is a little loud. Not my longest review, but that's all i have to say"
1,would be nice if I received it,"This fan looks great, but despite saying that it is in stock, the company that Amazon outsources with for this product does not actually have any available. After several weeks and sending me two emails telling me that it is delayed, the order was finally cancelled. Yippee."
1,Broken on Day One,This fan woke me up last night with a LOUD clicking and thumping sound. Don't buy! I am not happy with this product.
2,10 inch Cheeesecake,"late delivered, I paid extra charge for faster delivery but is not delivered on the time i've expected it."
3,BODY GLOVE FOR IPOD,"WHILE I USUALLY LIKE BODY GLOVE PRODUCTS....THIS ONE WAS TOO TIGHT. RIPPED WHEN TRYING TO PUT IT ON. I WOULD PASS ON THIS ONE. I BOUGHT THE HARD PLASTIC COVER. PROTECTS BETTER, AND IT FIT."
4,"I am a ""goody two shoes""","A ""goody two shoes"" says nice things about everything. Well this is one of a few reviews of mine and I still can't stop loving the oldies.If you want to acquaint yourself with a fantasy l920's, check into your video time machine and find yourself living in a cute and weightless world where people fall in love in two seconds and out of love in a half an hour.They also have meteoric careers in two minutes and sing a lot about their loves or disappointments;and there is Jeanette MacDonald singing beautifully as alwlays and talented Ramon Navarro, acting and singing well. The songs are pretty and the world is one we would love to believe in."
4,quickfast's review,"Is this the end, we need more is doesn't give enough information. need more. It left you hanging. I was getting good. It there a vol. Six. If so is it come out soo."
2,I didn't like this!!!!,the movie was of poor quality. and did'nt even match the other kind of dracula. will not watch it again.
1,Broke after 6 months of use,The pump broke after only six months of use. Only used it 6 times on some bus tires.
1,don't even bother,"I bought this a couple of years ago for my bicycles. The compressor worked on and off to my fustration for about a year and then just stopped working - it powered on, but apparently the compressor didn't want to play. I forgot about it and after moving I found it and plugged it in last month. Won't even power up now - put it in recycling trash."
5,His Best. To date.,"Having seen the maximum mark given to Leosia by Cook and Morton I instantly became sceptical - expecting music that is probably extremely complex. Actually it is not. Leosia is beautifully melodic and rhytmic, even though either happens in time and space somehow - and I can't yet put a finger on details of this phenomenon - markedly different than the rest. Leosia (the title, a Polish word of rich international potential (the Leo) is witty its own way having English connotations of a rank and status beyond its origin).Litania is strong, Soul of Things is strong, I have not heard the GreenHill. Leosia is better than strong. A quiet yet uniquely powerful record.I think I saw Mr Stanko at a hip hop club the other day. He wasn't there for fun, he was listening very intently to the gifted dj, on search for new influences."
4,Interesting,"Stanko certainly knows his way around a trumpet and coaxes amazing textures I can't remember hearing from the instrument. But it's the drummer, with his cracklely sounds, and the bass player, with his deep gravelly tones, that make the record for me. The cd is pretty slow-paced and melancholy. Though not pure overboard free jazz - it does have strong themes - the recording is highly improvisational. Don't expect any catchy beats or melodies. Nevertheless, I can see why the Penguin jazz guide gave four stars and a crown; it's quite creative and a fascinating if challenging listen."
3,A bit boring,I haven't read the whole book because I got a bit bored with it....and that's all I have to say
4,Great music,"Cd 1 is a cool cd, preparing for a more electro bite in the 2 cd. Great song selection, ready for a chilling moment..."
5,My life in (HALOGEN) orange!,"The music on this album... there's not enough that can be said. It is magical, short and to the point. Hey -- it's only 15 minutes long, and those 15 minutes changed my life. While ""esoteric references"" was playing, a brick flew through the window of my soul and smashed the cd collection of my heart; as shining bits of broken and torn plastic melodies flew and tore at my soul, I felt a new beginning. I knew the answers, now: HALOGEN orange!"
3,Functional but inelegant,"This device reminds me of those times long ago that you'd make a capo from a pencil, securing it with rubber bands. It worked fairly well but had to be removed and reattached to make it move on the neck. This rolling capo has a similar look but has the advantage of living on the neck and rolling from its home behind the nut to behind any desired fret. The product description suggests you can accomplish this rolling easily using your thumb to move the wheel which is located on the neck. For me, that's been impossible, though it's fairly easy to grasp the capo and move it up or down as needed. I've been using it for a few weeks. There are no buzzes when it's positioned behind frets and the guitar stays in tune. If it were a little smaller and actually could be easily moved using the thumb to roll it, I'd give it five stars."
2,"Good concept, but ergonomically awkward","Great concept, but design is flawed. I was hoping this would be easy to slide during play. It takes a bit of force and adjustment to get it in place after you've got it on, so it's not ideal for adjusting during play unless you've got about a 5-second rest. Even then, I feel like it might push my strings out of tune if adjusted too much. It does hold the strings firmly down when in position.When playing the fret directly above the capo, I find that the my hand getting cramped against the protruding screw of the capo, so I haven't used it after trying it the first time. I'd give it 4 stars if not for this bad design, but because of this poor ergonomic design, it's very awkward and uncomfortable for me to use. I'm giving it 2 stars."
5,ANOTHER WINNER,Another great release from this smooth and smokey jazz singer...this time Claire is moving in a different direction fusing pop and soul with a jazz feel...and what a lot of feeling she puts into it...People Make The World Go Round simply SIZZLES with a slow groovy jazz vibe...u will not be dissapointed
4,Fun Flick,"While it is not ROAM, it is definately a fun movie. Starts out slow. Let's face it, how many of us can really enjoy mountain biking in winter (except us lucky ones in Arizona... we just can't bike in the heat of the summer). The movies covers the life of competition as well as riding with friends. Love this movie."
3,Good but not Great,Nice Insight into the lives of the riders profiled but ultimately not as good as recent productions. Some great wire shots and some memorable moments. Ultimately a collection of short sequences that dont really hang together well. My 2c..
3,Necessary to use Pet ramp for pool.,Pet Ramp Swimming Pool Leg Kit should come with ramp. Works as advertised. Need to put tennis balls or some kind of stopper at bottom of legs or the will punch a hole in bottom of a pool with a liner.
2,Pet Ramp Swimming Pool Leg Kit,"The rubber caps at the base of the legs fall off easily. When set up on the ramp it is extremely wobbly, does not feel safe. In all great marketing photos, but lacking greatly in performance during pool use."
1,The design/materials are awful,"The concept is outstanding. The design/materials are awful. In less than one week the paddle screws rusted. Also, they wouldn't hold the brace in place. No matter how tight I screwed the fiddle screws in that attach the legs to the ramp, they would fall out after several uses of the ramp. The aluminum brace is so flimsy that it bent. We have a 9-month-old Golden Retriever puppy that used the ramp and legs. The return process took weeks for Amazon and seller to straighten out, and the refund was only about 60% of cost."
5,Amazing deal - bag and two lenses!!!,"I thought something was wrong with the description but hey, a bag with two lenses for so cheap?yep, you get a padded bag and two amateur/starter level lenses. a good starter kit."
1,Serious Error of Facts,"This book contains the statement that Andrea Bocelli was laughed off the stage in Werther at Detroit's Michigan Opera Theater. I was there and I know that comment is not true. In fact, the performances of Werther were sold out. Opera News, published by the Metropolitan Opera Guild, gave Mr. Bocelli an excellent review. When a writer makes a statement which I know from personal knowledge to be untrue, I wonder if there are other errors in his book. I prefer to buy books which are more thoroughly researched."
1,false information,"I have not read this book,but I have read an excerpt from it. The author claims Andrea Bocelli,was laughed off the stage.Laughed off the stage,indeed.This is a total lie,the man recieved standing ovations from his ""Werther"" performance.Although the critics were not kind,they seldom are,they cannot except his immense popularity,the audience was very pleased with his performance. For anyone,that has never heard Mr.Bocelli,please do try to hear him,he is wonderful,his voice is beautiful,and he is a wonderful human being,unlike the author of this book. I would like to see Mr.Dobkins manuver himself on stage blindfolded,now that would be laughable. I would never buy this book,because of the untruths in it.I would advise any fan of Andrea Bocelli,to not buy this book."
2,Rock and Roll,"I bought this bag on the recommendations read here. I was flying to Florida and didn't want to check any luggage. This bag had plenty of room for everything I needed for a week and would be fine if you wanted to carry it as a duffel bag. However, if you plan to rush from your car to the airport and then through the airport to the gate, don't plan on rolling with this bag. It wobbled from side to side so badly that I had to carry it, defeating its purpose. I thought maybe it was the way I had packed, so on the way home, I only packed clothes in the main section and bought a bag to carry my other things. It made no difference at all. If you want a bag you can easily roll through airports, don't buy this one."
5,"Not My favorite Mandie Book , but still EXCELLENT reading!!","I think she ( Lois Gladys Leppard ) could have added a little bit more zing to the story, but overall it was worth reading!"
4,So-so,"Joe is back from collage for vacation, and Mandie is excited about seeing him. But when she does see him, she is suddenly shy with her old friend. But she is sure that despite of it, they will still have a wonderful visit.But while on their way to visit Sallie they come upon a gigantic mound of mica. How did it get there, and what happened when a few days later, it disappears? Find out in Mandie and the Buried Stranger!This book could have been better. The buried stranger isn't buried until about the end, and Mandie knew who he was because she had met him before. But it's still a good book, although I have been getting a bit tired with mysteries connected with Mandie's Cherokee relatives. But don't get me wrong, this is still a good book. Read it!"
1,Don't bother with this one.,"Kleinberg's book attempts to illustrate the terrible effects of the steel mills on working class families in Pittsburgh. Although her overall point is well-taken, other better books on this topic exist. Perhaps I only noticed it because we were studying it from a quantitative (numbers and statistics) history viewpoint, but her tables and statistics are very badly set up and explained. To put it simply, her numbers often do not add up."
3,"Green peppercorn, but not fresh","Those are green peppercorns, will do the job all right, but my main complaint is, that they are not actually green. They don't even smell fresh. They were most likely stored on a light or are fairly old. Would not buy them again.19 Dec 2012Changing my review to 3 stars. Apparently finding really green pepper corn is not a small task. Every single one I purchased so far is turning out to be something between gray, black and green. This one does have a nice smoky smell and seasons good."
5,A Prokofiev delicacy,"A very nice performance by the Kirov Ballet, and of course, a beautiful music by Prokofiev. My heart is divided between Prokofiev and Shostakovich, though I usually prefer the former (always with the permission of Stravinsky, of course)."
4,works like a charm,"The Olympus DM-10 Digital Voice Recorder works like a charm, recorded lectures clearly with almost no static and minimum background sound. The only downside to this great recorder is its incredibly small memory, I mean come on Olympus, a 64 MG memory is obsolete in 2005. This recorder records 2hr of high quality sound, or 22hr of poor. I just record the HQ and transfer the file to my computer after each time I use it. I wish this devise had a way to upgrade memory. The software is cheap and of no use, if using XP, don't bother installing it, windows will recognize the driver automatically. The dm-10 is also an mp3 player, though only 60min of music can be uploaded; it plays adequately wma and mp3s.In conclusion, great devise, unreasonably small memory."
5,Audio Power in Your Pocket,"The DM-10 is fantastic. I used it for recording memos, phone teleconferences transcripts, transferrig old cassettes of seminars to digital us a unit to unit stereo patch cord with my old Sony Walkman... and I burn and share audio CDs and e-mail MPEGS to business partners and clients every day. It works great on my iMac G5 and the Olympus software is easy to use. I bought the TP7 earbud telephone recorder with works incredibly well with cel phones, cordless phones and land lines. The acessories are available at olympus.com."
