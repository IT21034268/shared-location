1,I'm So Sorry,"I've been a Prince fan from the word GO, all the way back to Soft & Wet. If the man sneezed and recorded it, I wanted a copy (I exaggerate only to make you comprehend my loyalty). I was at the Purple Rain tour in DC, backstage at the old Cap Center, at the after party on Connecticut Avenue, dropped everything every time he appeared on anything, bought the movies (yes, even Under the Cherry Moon and Grafitti Bridge). But I'm sorry ... what happened here?????? I'm not feeling Prince on this one. I feel like he just took a bunch of old tunes and changed the words. Please believe me, I'd love nothing better than to extol the virtues of Musicology ... but where's the beef??!! I feel an artist needs to be innovative, as Prince usually is, to keep his fans interested. Is being inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame just cause to rest on one's laurels? Ugh .... wish I'd skipped it."
4,Classic.,"Prince is a classic gem.Prince decided to give what the people want, a danceable album, some catchy pop tunes that discuss some of the issues the society faces. This album is not another ""Purple Rain"" album; that was the 80's, so, the music has since changed and new fans have emerged; this is an extension of what will happen for years to come. So, if the general public want a danceable album, you got it. If you are looking for ""Purple Rain"", Prince has moved on and is advancing his musicianship and direction."
5,Comeback? The brotha has never left!,"What is everyone talking about ""Prince has found his way back home..."" The brother has never left his roots. Prince is a MUSICIAN and a true ARTIST, hence the nickname. I just saw his 'Royal Badness' in New Orleans in concert and I must say that I'm still dizzy from the effect of his unconventional creativity and almost obscene guitar stroking. The man is BAD and I mean this in the best way possible. Whether he's playing a blues tune such at ""Five Women"", or the pseud-Sanatra sounding ""Damn U"", Prince is truly the musical maestro that he professes to be!"
3,Second-Tier Prince Is Better Than None,"Prince's ""comeback"" has its moments, but no one can compare ""Musicology"" (2004) to the high standards established by ""Sign 'O' the Times"" and ""The Gold Experience."" The best tracks are ""A Million Days,"" ""Cinnamon Girl,"" ""What Do U Want Me 2 Do?"" and ""Dear Mr. Man."" Running a mere 47 minutes, ""Musicology"" delivers less than Prince's usual value for money. Nevertheless, it's nice to see His Royal Badness on the charts after a lengthy absence."
4,Good album,"""Musicology"" is a special treat for all of the loyal Prince fans. It's a great collection of some groovy and soulful tunes. Prince is relaxed and in his own space. He's not trying to sell any records or get radio play. He's an artist and he's just having fun sharing his talents with us. So if you're looking for some solid radio pop tunes. This is not the album for you. ""Musicology"" finds Prince in a more relaxed space and shows in his execution of the tunes on this album. You can tell that he is a true musician and new he's only into jamming - Prince style. I enjoy this album and I hope that there's another one out soon."
1,One hit wonder,"I am not really a huge fan of Prince, but I do enjoy some of his stuff (circa late 80's). I decided to spend a few dollars to see what The Kid is up to nowadays and boy, was I disappointed. Beyond the title song, ""Musicology"", I really can't say there is another song on there that I enjoyed listening to. Very disappointed."
1,Just a reminder to those that may not be 'in the know'...,"First of all I must confess that I haven't heard the entire CD yet, only snippets from a website(Although I do plan on purchasing the CD soon). Hence the one star. But I do want to say this to all: DO NOT TAKE ALL THE REVIEWS OF THIS CD AT FACE VALUE. A lot of the reviewers are trying to compare this new Prince record against the old Prince records. That's a mistake. Any true Prince fan knows that he has never been the type of artist that would do the same thing twice. As far as musicians go, Prince is as unpredictable as the weather. So to try and weigh his old stuff against his new stuff is not only irrelevant and unfair, its inane. C'mon folks, judge the man's music for what it is, not for what you wish it was."
4,One of the Best Prince Songs Ever is on this Disc,"""The Marrying Kind"" and it's segue into ""The Man in Your Life"" is worth the purchase. In true Prince fashion it is lyrically clever and musically nimble. Though it is one of Prince's most commercial projects in recent times, he continues to enhance and stretch the bounds of popular music. One thing I have always liked about Prince is that he does not rely on hits to make an album, you may not be enthralled on the first listen but you will find yourself listening to the entire Cd years later. This Cd is a gem and I hope that he gets his ass back in the studio and gives us another."
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"As a huge Prince fan, someone who likes almost anything this guy does, trust me when I say that Musicology is one of his weakest albums. I've seen him live; I own practically everything he has done; I am usually the one enjoying the albums the critics don't like. However, on Musicology, it's all been done before. Prince has nothing new to offer here. Look beyond the marketing ploy of the music and tv industry and you'll find yourself wondering if you'll ever play the cd after the first month. I realize that most of the reviews on this website are praising this album, and I respect others' opinions about music. But if you are normally a Prince fan and if you're asking yourself if you should buy this album, I strongly suggest you give it a listen before you buy. It might be time to just re-appreciate some of his great work on previous albums rather then shelling out the cash for this album."
2,SAME OLD SONGS,"SORRY I'M LATE WITH MY REVIEW, BUT THIS CD EASILY SLIPS ONES MIND. TO A HARDCORE PRINCE FAN, THESE SONGS SOUND LIKE THE MUSIC TO SIGN O TIMES. WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT MORE FROM PRINCE SOMETHING DIFFERENT. I REMEMBER AN ARTICLE FROM THE 80's, THAT STATED ""PRINCE WILL BECOME A WASHED UP LOUNGE SINGER THAT IS DESTINED TO REPEAT HIMSELF. I GUESS THEY WERE RIGHT. HOW SAD."
3,"""Musicology"" - A Mediocre Production","The only song that could be remembered after listening to Prince CD is ""Musicology"". The rest of the songs seem to be space fillers. There is no strong quality of the entire CD."
3,Much better than the average,"Well, you can't really go wrong with Prince, and even when he doesn't produce a masterpiece he is usually above the average. And this is the case with Musicology, labelled as a comeback by some, when the truth is that he never was really away. Some very good songs in it: ""Call my name"" is classic Prince, ""Dear Mr Man"" recalls ""Money Don't Matter Tonight"" with its social aspects, and ""Musicology"" is good fun as well. It is indeed a good album by someone who can do much better; the funny thing is that is being hailed as his best effort in fifteen years just because the promotion he got this time due to the Grammies... but don't be fooled, he has done better in the 90's as well (that's the way the music journalism is nowadays...)"
5,He's Back,"This album I'm ever so crazy about is Prince at his best.Quickly I have to say this album is raw emotion.How can you not be feelin' this album.""Musicology"" is the great first single.But a ""Million Days"" is Prince at form and ready to win you over, again."
4,"More Diamonds, Pearls and Still One Sexy MF-er","Eccentricities eternal, the man proves here once and for all that he is no one's fool to be reckoned with. Commercial blockbuster status aside, and sure, he cheated a little by giving away copies with every ticket sold, which counted toward his Scoundscan rebirth, the wee Jehovah Witness' `come back' dares you the believe its his most greatest work since the masterpiece `Sign of the Times' [it's not - but what is?] but it adhere's more to the funk of `Dirty Mind' and maybe the joy of `Parade' or `1999' without the message, and the insanity of `The Black Album' without the hard-core thump. So, keep his miraculous Rock And Roll Hall of Fame tribute to the quiet Beatle on that pedestal, and succumb here to his freshest collection of funk and roll and you too will be partying like its... Oh, you know. My grade: A-"
3,Average album,"This is supposed to be Prince's 'comeback' album? If you followed Prince during the past few years, then you'd know about rainbow children, One Nite Alone, ONA Live, Xpectation, and N.E.W.S., all way more musical than this album. There's nothing new on here and he sounds very bored and uninspired. Some tracks are severely underproduced (zzzz) and then there's overproduction which comes extra cheesy, with the exception of maybe 'Call My Name' and 'dear mr.man'. He has obviously took the commercial route on this one and tailored it for the mainstream to let the public know he still exists, and yes it went platinum but musically it's prob one of his worst albums... I gave it 3 stars only because it's still better than most garbage out there today. If you liked New Power Soul or Rave Un2 the joy fantastic u'll prob enjoy this more. Get One Nite Alone Live 3cd set instead... worth every penny."
5,Many shades of success,"Prince is and always will be one of the great musical talents of our time. First and foremost, Prince is a writer and a poet. His music makes you think and visualize, if nothing else you are able to relate or reflect on his lyrics. True fans will love this CD not because it is similar to his earlier music but because this CD shows the vast range of his talents. Prince fans are not bubble gum chewing adolescents. Real fans of Prince love music (all types) and are poetic by nature - music is in their soul."
4,He's BACK!,"After enjoying him in concert last week, now I'm enjoying his new CD Musicology, which was distributed free to all concert goers! I just love the guitar in ""Coma, Pimp, Illusion & Circumstance""...The funk! Ah, the funk! Nothing to put you in a great mood ALL DAY! The Prince we love is back and we should embrace him for the musical genius that he is. We almost passed out at the concert from all that dancing! Couldn't sit down! Just amazing!"
5,At last real music!!!!,This cd is one of the best that I have bought in a long time. I will keep this one in the dash for a while.
2,One of Price's First Real Fans,"From For You, his first album, until Musicology, I have kept up with Prince's music. This album, like the ones released within the last 8 years, does not meet the standard I have come to expect from the musical genius Prince. The lyrics lack creativity and inspiration and make me leary of ever buying another album from Price without hearing it in its entirety."
2,WHERE'S PRINCE?,"It doesn't augur well for an artist when an album of 12 numbers sports a piddly 2 that are borderline listenable:1. Illusion, Coma, Pimp & Circumstance...which rides on the popularity of ""Pu$$y Control"" and sounds suspiciously similar2. Cinnamon Girl...which revives some broody electric guitar strings from the Prince of yoreOther than these two nostalgic flashes of snazz, this album is a tragic exercise in flaming monotony. Perhaps a creative drum here (What do you want me 2 do) or an acoustic arrangement there (Reflection), but overall a skippable fare.I hate to say this but I regret this purchase. It's time for Prince/The Love Symbol/Whats-Your-Name-Today to smell some contemporary latte and introduce some more variety into his music! I'm beginning to miss the albums we would rush to the store for.."
4,Prince is back? He never left!,"I have news for all the people saying Prince is back. He never left. I have bought an album about every 1-2 years for over 20 years. Anway this CD is great. It may have a little difficulty stacking up with princ's elite albums, but it blows away anything played on the radio. I wonder if anyone will ever get radio play without major label backing. This CD gets better and better each time you listen to it. It is very diverse and original. The musicianship is outstanding. The song writing goes from Funky dance to tender love, to social and spritual consciousness."
4,"Yeah, another great effort","Prince has always followed his own path in music and has raised the bar for many in the business. His music is genuine and real, not something marketed by the record companies. This album is another poetic example of Prince at his musical best."
1,disappointing,"I loved his 80's joints as a kid and still play them every now and then, but Musicology is very disappointing. The album definitely does not live up to it's name and the title track, dear mr. man and cinammon girl are the only good songs. Though Prince is looking good these days, I can't say the same for the rest of the songs on this CD. He did successful with touring this year, but I think he cheated in terms of album sales by giving out free copies of the CD for each ticket sold and counting it towards units sold. He could barely sell over 100,000 copies per album he's been releasing for the past 6 years or so. I think he will be remembered more for his 80's stuff because it was really good and I constantly hear those classics on the radio. Stick with tPrince: the Hits 3 disc set if anything."
2,This pains me,"I love Prince. I've been a fan for a few decades now and I see him EVERY time he comes to Atlanta. But this album...included in the price of a contert ticket last year is...well, a disappointment. There are two songs Musicology and Call my name that are really any good. The rest sounds...well, the same. In fact, the last FEW albums sound the same. I understand he's older but that no reason to bore your fans."
3,Return of the Jedi Prince,"Musicology sees the return of Prince to mainstream music. And its that return that makes this album average. The album does have its highlights, but is apparent that it was made for mainstream exposure. This isn't necessarily bad, but Prince made a career out of making music for the sake of making music. Which is what ""musicology"" is about, but this album is not about that."
1,Musicology,"Really, whatever happened to Prince? Ever since Lovesexy he has gone from bad to worse. Whoever rated Graffiti Bridge, Diamonds and Pearls or this Musicology a 5 star album most definately didn't like Prince for the same reasons I did.Firstly I think he's lost all faith in himself. He was so brilliant when he used to write funny, tender and thought-provoking lyrics. Did not everyone marvel at the line 'It's been 7 hours and 15 days since you took your love away..'If I could say one thing to Prince it would be: 'You were the one who taught us all to be ourselves which is what you're NOT being now. We loved you because you said what you thought and a lot of people REALLY got you!We loved you because it sounded like your albums were produced on your keyboard in your bedroom and there is nothing more tender or true than that.'"
3,"Funky yes, but","Sometimes I can almost get through this whole album, but I haven't yet. The title song is funky and catchy, but there is this not so subtle smugness that weaves its way through most of these songs. His smug, birdlike arrogance has always kept me away from most of his music over the years. He could easily replace the refrain ""Musicology..."" with ""I am so talented..."" Yeah, we know how talented you are, King Prince.And now the me-sexual references have been replaced by God-Rules references(Now he has a bible in his pocket). Yikes.(Isn't there a height requirement in his religion so you can reach the door bell?)Musicology...I am so talented..."
2,"great title, great new look, not-so-great music","the music on this CD was overrated and the only good songs were musicology which sounds like it's full of 80's synthesizers anyways; and dear mr man which was hot when he performed it on BET. The dude is getting fine like wine with time, but I haven't enjoyed his music since 1992. Sorry purple one."
2,"he's a hot fella, but the music aint","how this sold multiplatinum status is questionable when he couldn't even sell 100,000 per album for the last 10 years and the music on this CD aint all that. How could this sell more than, say, janet's damita jo or madonna's american life which are far more superior than this attempt at a comeback? I guess paying sony to give away albums for each concert ticket worked in his favour, but it's still considered cheating. I only like 3 songs and the rest has no melody or hook just sounds like a mess thrown together. Please go listen to real music, go pull out your old michael jackson records if you have to, he was always better than prince anyways...."
1,Prince needs a Revolution to save this effort,This is straight garbage. Yes title track Musicology is funky but Prince has forgetten what it's like to care if people like his music. He feels that since he's made it he's not accountable to anyone but musicians are always accountable to their fans. Diehards will still like it because that's what diehards do. Prince's diehards will continue to dwindle on this effort. Prince lost it many albums ago when he started playing a lot of things in major keys instead of minors. I guess us simpletons just don't get it huh?
2,"Not bad, not great","Musicology to me lacks what the majority of the Prince releases in the last 10 years or so have lacked, creative songwriting. From the meandering ""jazz"" of NEWS to the bland throwaway funk vamps of Musicology, he never seems to invest in the craft of songwriting anymore. This was supposed to be a return to that, but with a few exceptions (What do you want me to do, A Million Miles), it dissapoints. The slow songs included do not break any new ground and sound like the same old tired r&b grinds of before.Make no mistake, the man can still bring it on stage and when he comes to your town run don't walk to the ticket office and go see him live. By the way, when you do, you'll get this CD for free...which makes it a bit more palpable than paying for it."
4,a good album,"I bought this album recently and put it on cassette for my everyday driving to the job. I must say that this is very fine music. All songs flow smoothly one after another and singing and musicianship is excellent.For me Prince is a single best popular music artist since Bob Dylan. No one comes close to his versality, persona and talent. Sure this album is not as good as "" sign of the times"" but i must say that I can not find better new CD as this one in record shop."
4,His most accesible effort in years,"The lead single ""musicology"" grooves like a good dance tune should, and is getting airplay on tv/radio.Musically, the album is very listenable. Many Prince fance have shyed away from his recent efforts, which were not aimed at the pop market - this one is.One of the things that makes this album good is the quality of musicans. I love the inclusion of John Blackwell on drums on most of the tracks. Many current stars, from Alicia Keys to Michael Jackson are using programmed drums when they should have live bands. Prince has a good live band, and isn't afraid to use them on his record.If you have been looking for a good Prince album, more like his releases from the 70's/80's - here it is. An all around good effort."
4,Great Cd..Awful Packaging,"prince is back, well he never really left, just fell out of popularity while still making creative and inventive music....on this cd prince goes back to his roots...funk, rock n roll and soul...even brings back candy dulfer who gives her sax a complete workout...this cd is HOT...title track is perfect twangy funk with echoes to the past....you will need to spend time with this cd,it will seep into your brain and then fry it...the packaging on this cd is downright awful, the booklet just drops out of the cd, the digipak cannot shut tightly..its an abortion....our industry is trying to combat on line downloading and packaging, this will push me more to make my own cds....and put them in jewel cases where they belong!!!!! ROCK ON PURPLE ONE!!"
2,Sad Disappointment,"I am a serious cook with a large cookbook library. I am a Southerner who made my first biscuits and gravy at age 5. This book is a not-so-well done re-hash of other Foxfires and sorely disappointing. It is difficult to use as a cookbook-more poignant than useful. Also a tad light on recipes. A much better book from North Georgia (Southern Appalachia, like the Foxfire series) is Smokehouse Ham, Spoon Bread & Scuppernong Wine: The Folklore and Art of Southern Appalachian Cooking. I use this one a lot, enjoy reading the stories, and frequently give it as gift to visiting Yankees. Plus it has the wit, charm, and authenticity so sadly missing from the Foxfire Cookbook."
2,Doesn't quite live up to the blurb,Bought this to try and learn more about dealing with my home grown meat but got only recipes for odd cuts. The blurbs had mentioned curing meats but the recipes did not address this.
2,Authentic recipes?,"Souffle? Really? I can not imagine that in any appalachian kitchen. The deviled eggs are listed as having olives. Huh? Where did these recipes come from? It appears that the stories are from the Foxfire books, of which I am a great fan, but the actual recipes just don't make any sense."
5,Foxfire book - good as usual!,"This book has much to make it interesting - the pictures and stories are good, and the recipes are pure Appalachia. This book is for those interested in history, cooking, homesteading, folklore and southern Appalachian living. Facinating book!"
4,cook book collector,"this was a gift for my mother, she was thrilled with the gift, as we have purchased Foxfire Books and are familiar with them and have enjoyed them for years."
3,Interesting history of Southern Christmas,"Any student of Americana should read this book.It is interesting in how you can do a lot, with a little."
5,Interesting book,"Interesting book, may be outdated. Got multiple copies of this book in the mail, and only ordered one. Gave some to my psychiatrist, he/she probably think that most of the stuff in here is wrong."
5,Awesome mix!,This is a great set to have.... Great music- mixed well- medley's are very well done... I love it!
5,Wonderful,I received my copy of Hanukkah... and all the Jazz today.What wonderful and refreshing renditions of familiar Hanukkah tunes. My husband enjoyed it so much he wanted to take it to his office and listen to it there also. This is destined to become one of my favorite holiday CDs.
4,Good for swelling,"After being discharged from the hospital with a very large DVT (from below my knee to my pelvic area), I was advised to wear these during the day whilst being ambulatory. They start showing elastic shredding and sagging after 2-3 weeks of daily use, with hand washing or gentle machine washing (cold water, in a lingerie bag, air dry or very low heat tumble dry) 2-3x a week. After 4-5 weeks, the elastic has unraveled itself 2-3"" at the top of the stocking, and along the gusset, but has no other issues (no nubs or snags, no weak spots, nothing threadbare, no holes).When donning these, make sure you've no rings/jewelry on (to prevent snags) and short fingernails (long ones will damage the stocking). These are ideal for lounging and for those who are bedridden, but can be tricky for those who are up and about (like myself). That said, these control my post-thrombolic swelling beautifully. I now have 3 pairs."
5,Be Ready,We are using this book as a Bible study for a Men's Class. We all have been interested in the way it is laid out. Seems to be working out well.
2,Doesn't get make up off,"I really really wanted to love this line, but as a thirty something with occasionally acne who likes to put on a fair amount of make-up this line does not work to remove my make-up at all. I end up going over my face with this toner several times and it still comes up not clean on the cotton ball, so I bummed out!! It's not cheap either."
3,Just okay,"The story of Leah and J.T. West. They seemed to have a bit of chemistry. Was a bit disconcerting that she was married when she hooked up with J.T. She then talks of a divorce with her husband but then J.T. left town for about a year and a half and then he returns. He is of course running from the law. That part of the story could have been better drawn out in order to creat more suspense yet it wasn't. Felt a bit let down by that. Then we believe that Leah committed adultery and her poor husband still wants to take her back. He wants to work things out. Yet he has been keeping a secret too. So somehow while the heroine did something bad, her husband comes out looking even worse!"
4,Trip on this!,"I had stumbled across this compilation on Ebay, after hooking myself up with the later collection ""Flexistentialism"", which is equally good. This batch of tunes is much more suited to the coffee shop than the coupe, but it's still worth picking up if you can find it."
3,Not too hot in da kitchen...,"Good sound with great syncopation. As a percusssionist, it makes me wanna sit down behind a kit and tap out the bass all by itself. Easy to listen to and definitly puts you in the mood to clean your place with a snap to your step."
5,a great video,"""The Loretta Young Show,"" is wnderful and beautiful to watch. The stories are always heartwarming, meaninful, and decent, and Loretta is beautiful and dresses in lovely gowns in the beggining of the show, before the story. I highly recommend these videos. All of them in the series are great. I recommend all of the tapes."
1,Not a good book. Bad for all developers.,"The only thing that actually assisted me in this book was with dynamic LOV's. I searched for a way to develop a dynamic record group. The book did not give any examples of dynamic record groups, but instead I piecemealed a solution from its explanation of dynamic LOV's. The book does not separate the Developer tools (Forms, Reports, Graphics) into separate sections. Instead, the author mixes them together throughout the book. It becomes extremely difficult to find a solution or examples to certain areas within Developer."
1,The help file in developer is better than this book...,Total waste of money.... each time I look at it to find things I wasted time... and in the end I found it in the developer help file... If you want to learn about developer forms... forget this book.... I started from scratch using dev form and this book does not even tell me where PL/SQL is used in the form... I had to struggle just to understand how to put PL/SQL codes in the form and I found out using trial and error... Why can't we have a book like HowTO do this or that or whatever... that is much more useful approach than to read tons of theories about what the individual parts is about... Anyone who want to write Dev book with a HowTO title.... please contact me and I'll buy from you... it'll be bound to be better than this book...
1,Worst of (Oracle Series),This is the worst book of the Oracle Series. I wanted to buy a book on this topic but I didn't.
1,Don't buy it !!,"Briefly, the book mixes the big picture with the detail in an inconsistent and very odd manner. I am half way thru it at the moment and feel it will be a complete waste of time to continue. There is no logic in the sequence of its sections, likewise within a particular section. I hope I don't sound too critical, but this book is really a joke !"
2,This is not a handbook!,Lacking both meat and bones this gives you only a breath and smell of the subject. If you intend to never use Developer 2000 but just want to be able to drop some lingo to your knowledgable associates get this book. If however you need to learn (or teach as I do) how to use the application pass this by. My last class of eight (first to get the book) rated it a one star; I give it two for its use as a lingo teacher.
2,"Too theoretical, not for the developer or technical user.","If you need a technical reference for Developer/2000 tasks this is not the book. The documentation provided by Oracle Education in Developer/2000 classes contain more real-world examples and provides more guidance in actual forms and reports development. If you need to educate a business analyst on RDBMS application development fundamentals, this might be a good book for you."
1,Terrible,"This book use a sample database ""Talbot system"", which it does not exist in its enclosed CD ROM. It probably assume that reader will have to type in all data to learn developing skills!!Without the sample database, it is totally useless. Even with it, it is a poor book if you want to learn ""Developer 2000""."
1,Hope that someone writes a real developer's guide.,"This book is useless for people who need to build real solutions using Developer/2000. Being the only book out there on Developer/2000 2.x, it's sad to say the authors must bear a enormous amount of frustration from developers who need to get beyond the basics and get into the nuts and bolts of Oracle development. Even so, this is not a good beginner book either. Too much time is spent on business processes. While this is an important topic in software development, this book is not the place for it. We need a ""hacker's guide"" to Developer and what we get is the MBA's guide. All other major toolsets from other vendors have an abundance of excellent books about them. Unfortunately, Dev/2K 2.x lags behind in this area too. Being this is the only book on Dev/2K 2.x, I'll continue struggling along with reference manuals."
2,waste of money,This book is amazingly useless. No specific information. This book is totally not suitable for anybody who has done any programming in his life.
1,Bad quality toilet paper,"Totally useless for those of us who are looking for a book to learn Forms4.5 and Reports2.5. No efficient tutorial, no real technical examples, no glossary, no reference, but a bunch of business processing flow charts instead. I gave the book to one of my management consultant, he looked at it and said his most common sentence:'Oh, that's intresting!'... See what I mean?"
3,A disappointment,"By trying to cover all aspects of Developer/2000, the book yields little value to the professional. In fact, much of the material in the book can be ignored if one were to simply go through Oracle's own samples and tutorials. The book would have contributed more had the author focused on one aspect, especially, Forms design and deployment."
2,Ego vs. Truth,"Bottom line, the facts of History do not back up the Ego of the Author. More time should have been spent viewing the opinions held, by way of the events held within. Is it not a Jewish tradition to...""Question what you believe""? This Author obviously hasn't."
3,"insightful, but a bit petty","Mr. Levine's book is two things: 1.) informative and compelling, and 2.) petty and immature. Shame, too. His questions to missionaries are good questions, and his support of the jewish position is great, but his inability to separate his personal emotion from the discussion seems to weaken his credibility. Instead of reading like a scholarly dissertation on the validity of the classical jewish position, it appears more like his personal opinion. Also, he footnotes his personal opinions frequently, as if he's trying to convince the reader that the christian viewpoint is foolish or stupid, rather than conveying the rich and logical validity of judaism. In short, Levine's book is good, but it would have been great had he not stooped to name-calling and accusation."
5,The truth is finally told,"Growing up I always wondered the answers to the questions I was asked by missionaries trying to convert me. This book gives the answers in an easy to read manner. Ever since reading this book five years ago, I have been so strong in my beliefs and can now answer the questions asked by missionaries. This book should be read by everyone."
5,Fascinating little big book.,"If you're illiterate about this theme, learn easy, and pick up a new point of view - better say many points. And a new way of thinking too. If you're a knower play with these models, join the established community for more answers, and apply these models to real situations. A very helpful mate for think tanks, marketing execs as me, engineers, biologists, and anybody who need new responses for old problems. A funny, serious, and very very illustrative reading in few pages!."
3,Is a good start but needs more...,"Book needs some more content, it gives a good first level intro but does not develop it into more interesting/advanced things.50% of the book is a 'sales' pitch for StarLogo.If you have experience with writing code for simulations this book is a bit light technically.Still has some interesting ideas in it."
2,The title promised more,Maybe my rating is unfair but I expected a little deeper treatment of the topics mentioned in the title. Perhaps the title should give an indication that it is a broad treatment for the layman. It is a good book for an advanced high school reader or college freshman Most of the personal explorations of the author's musings required the use of a program that would have been only fair to include with the book or made accessible via the Net.
4,The right one .,"After operating my car with the wrong T-stat for over a year ( too cold ). I finally checked spec and replaced the old unit with this one . The results were surprising , although the engine operates in a warmer temp range , op temp range is now more consistent ( just under half gauge ) . Engine idle is more robust , power delivery on acceleration is smoother , and the best bonus is noticably better MPG . Although I havent calculated the increase ,the interval between gas station visits is definitely longer . I am surpised merely changing a t-stat could so radically improve the overall performance of the 1997 Saturn 1.9 SOHC engine , despite the 190,000 miles on the odometer !"
3,Very Bloody,"I enjoy books about medieval Europe, so I began this book with optimism. However, it was a bit too gruesome for me and it didn't seem very well researched. on the other hand, Lily is a sympathetic character that one grows to like. But over all, this book didn't measure up to other historical novels, like those of Karen Cushman, which give a better sense of the Middle Ages."
4,Impressive!,"Myrkskog takes a more direct death metal approach on Superior Massacre. It's a solid and original release, although it reminds me of Hate Eternal at times. There is some good leadwork on guitar and the drummer is on fire. This band is not fooling around!!"
3,Generic one-gear death metal,"Myrkskog deliver a technically stunning and ultimately brutal style of death metal that is good, but doesn't switch tempos enough to really make my jaw drop. They stay at one speed for practically the entire album, think if zyklon had no breakdowns and if hate eternal was, well hate eternal then you get what i'm talking about. As for the production it's decent i mean the vocals are almost inaudible, i find myself straining to here thembut other then that its good. The songwriting is what kinda got me into them in the first place, they do some polyrythmic and guitar lines that go against time and drum patterns which is cool, but thats all the album really has to offer. So in short if you have 10 bucks to go throw out on a brutal death metal cd go ahead and buy it, or just wait for the new deeds of flesh, or zyklon."
3,George starts slipping....,"Now THIS is where I thot George started seriously slipping (if it wasn't when I saw the small amount of new work in his previous collection, NIGHTFLYERS). There is 1 good new story here -- ""In the Lost Lands."" It has the mood & magic of so many of George's early greats. Some of the other stories R recycled from George's earlier collections: it's a pleasure 2 C ""With Morning Comes Mistfall,"" ""Second Kind of Loneliness,"" & ""Lonely Songs of Laren Door"" again, & they certainly brighten up this package. ""Unsound Variations"" is a pretty good chess story. ""Under Seige"" is pretty solid, 2. But the others R mostly disappointments. ""Portraits of His Children"" won a Nebula Award, & tho it's a vivid series of character sketches, I didn't get what all the fuss was about. It's tuff 2 keep crankin out greats at the low rates of pay in the SF field. Is that why George took a 10-year vacation to TV?"
5,A great carriage whip,"This is a lightweight, well-balanced whip for horse driving. The handle is 1/2 inch diameter, which is a little loose for my cart's whip holder, but it does stay in.The seller packaged it very well and it arrived within 1 week.This is a great value, and is highly recommended."
1,You get what you pay for!!,"I ordered the whip to help when I need to move my cows. It broke after about two uses. It was flimsy and light weight so it would not pop. Next time I buy something of this sort, I will want to buy it at a store where I can see it first."
5,Excellent Binoculars for astronomy.,"I recently got into astronomy in a big way - went out and bought not one - but two Meade computer controlled telescopes with the latest and greatest eyepieces, etc. After doing some research and through trial and error, I have come to the conclusion that the best way to start out in astronomy is to buy a pair of 10x50 binoculars - the Meade Mirage 10x50's are an excellent choice - and ""learn the sky"" with the binoculars before moving on to a telescope. These binoculars are so good they may be all the telescope you ever need."
4,Great Value and a Fishman Classic IV Pickup!!!,"I can't believe people whine about this thing.If you received a blem, send it back until it's made right.The tone of mine is great both acoustic and electric. The finish is beautiful and it has binding on both the neck and the body. The tuners are good quality sealed (by Ping?) and hold well. The nut is decent and strap buttons good (1/4 plug goes in end strap pin). The bridge saddle was a bit high so I sanded it down and it lowered action to a comfortable level. I love the guitar so much that I took it to a luthier and had him profile the frets for $60 and was worth every penny. I purchased the guitar at MF a few years back on sale for $79 and it plays like a dream; love it. A real keeper.It doesn't say Martin, Gibson or Breedlove on the headstock, but I've gotten over it (you will too)."
1,This book's advertisment is better than it's content,"This book contains less information on sex than a typicalarticle in Cosmopolitan. The author spends about 5 minuteson lovemaking and the rest of the book is just fluff. Theauthor does not seem to have any knowledge of sex except herown personal experience. I should have known that the bookwould be lame when I read Naura Hayden's biographical info.Instead of listing credentials, she lists her height, weight,and other single's ad familiars. The book is 120 pages of printabout as big as one would find in a 4th grade reading primer. NauraHayden clearly had a hard time getting enough down on paperto fill a book."
2,drivel,"I remember bookstores carrying early editions of this book 24 years ago. It never caught on, because Hayden's premise is fundamentally flawed. To wit, what works for Naura Hayden's Victorian sexual response doesn't generalize to all or even most women. It should properly have been titled, ""How to Satisfy Naura Hayden Every Time"". There are a few pages of instruction that spell out the technique for satisfying Naura Hayden every time, and the rest of the book is tease, fluff, and unsubtle cross-promotion."
5,"Be advised, It works perfectly.","Global thermonuclear lovemaking in three pages!Frigid women go multi, multi orgasmic.The physical key to a super successful relationship.""How to make up for 30 years of separation in less than 5 years""."
5,The fireworks are guaranteed!!,"Romance and conversation are great, but when you're ready to get down to business, the one technique discussed in this book will effectively bring her right up to launch and have her begging you to light her fuse!!!"
5,A must read for every woman,"Great book, not only explain how a man can fully satisfy his partner, but also explain to every women how simple things can be very powerfull, and taking time to enjoy it instead of rushhhhhhhhhhh.... ok is done.. A must read for every woman and man... excellent."
1,The single worst sexual education book I've ever read.,"I am stunned that this book has received as many positive words as it has by Amazon readers. The book is singularly the worst sexual education book I've ever read. Ms. Hayden's actual instruction is about 2 pages of potentially useful material, the rest is simplistic filler. The ""insight"" you gain from the book can be obtained by actually talking with your female for more than 5 minutes on what she actually prefers. The title sounds grand and glorious; too bad the book doesn't even fulfill 1% of your expectations."
2,Move On,"There isn't much in here that you can't learn from a good romance novel. If you want to have a woman begging, try a little old fashioned romance. THE ROMANTIC'S GUIDE is the best book I've seen on how to romance women."
3,Same old Nanci!,"This album is well played, well sung and enjoyable. However there's nothing new on here that we haven't heard from Nanci before. There's no outstanding live versions of tracks we've heard before (The live version of love at the five and dime from ""One Fair Summer Evening"" fills out and expands the song from a short album filler to a titanic tale of love found lost and found again), and the new tracks don't tug at the heartstrings or linger long in the memory (although her previous studio album clearly showed that she can do that with (for me) ""Armstrong"" being one of the best songs she's ever sung.I think one of the reasons may have been the dropping of the narrative between songs which were such a highlight of ""One Fair Summer Evening"" - talk to any Nanci fan about popcorn machines and you'll bring back the whole introduction with references to vanilla cokes and getting off the bus at South Austin. Buy the DVD instead! I'm going to"
2,"Better named... ""the worst of Nanci Griffith"".","I purchased this DVD because I love the voice, the warmth, and the immense inner beauty of this woman... Nanci Griffith.I was totally disappointed. The first 4 songs/performances were mediocre, at best. When it finally got to a song that felt real, it was overwhelmed by the background... Don't get me wrong, I love the slide steel (and other instruments) but they should compliment not compete with Nanci's superb voice.Most of this DVD sounded over produced and just annoying. I'd like to say there is something/anything redeeming about this DVD but I couldn't find it.If you're a Nanci Griffith lover... avoid this DVD."
4,Nanci sounds great live! ...4.5 stars,"While her last couple of studio albums have suffered from dull, energy-sapping production, this live album finally gives her songs a chance to shine with some of the vitality that characterized much of her earlier work. On Winter Marquee, the songs sound crisp and fresh, but with an enhanced sense of maturity and experience to back them up...not to mention some of her famous aw-shucks commentary in between a few of them. Stand-out songs include great renditions of ""There's a Light Beyond These Woods (Mary Margaret)"" and ""Listen to the Radio"". The new songs on the disc are also quite strong and should stand up well over time with the rest of the material here. Overall, it's a very classy and honest performance."
2,A Road to Nowhere,"The prequel to the award-winning Praise, this book is marginally better than that empty outing. The plot has all kinds of interesting possibilities: two 21ish guys (one painter, one writer) who just met decide to take a 6-month job as weather observers on a national park out in the middle of nowhere. But not much happens to the two losers since they don't make any effort to do anything except get drunk and stoned all the time. There's no great conflict, no insights gained, and perhaps that is the point Mcgahan is trying to make about that generation of Australian youth. Or at least a certain segment of them. Either way, there's got to be a more interesting way of making the point."
3,A wandering disappointment...,"Salanger, Copland and ... McGahan? The angst of youth was captured much more thoughoughly by the former. This book starts out slows, and nevers capitalizes on the potential of the setting, or the imagery of the lighthouse. I kept wondering what Albert Camas would have done to better capture the isolationism and the mental terror of being stranded st a deserted post with limited human contact, The book wanders, stalls and ends without making any significant statement. The narrator started a loser, is a loser throughout the story, and ends a loser. Unfortunately, 1988 never develops and never makes a statement as strong as Salanger or Copland regarding the trails and tribulations of youth"
5,great addition,This was a great addition to my sons growing lego soccer stadium-he was very happy. The price was high for the amount of legos in the set
3,Could it be cheaper?????,For lego's Super Sport Coverage I think it is a great toy if you like lego's and you have the other parts of Lego Soccer. I think it could be cheaper. For example it could be 15 dollars because it is not a lego where you role it and play with it often. I understand that there are a lot of special parts but thats besides the point.
3,An entertaining submarine yarn,"Just now I am into submarine yarns, and author H. Jay Riker seems to be a pretty good writer of this genre. This is the story of a submarine skipper conducting an anti-terrorism mission in the Western Pacific. More would be telling, but this is not a bad story, and the author's discussion of the merits of various types of submarines, and their various strengths and weaknesses, is quite interesting. It is definitely not just technobabble.On the minus side, the author's characterizations are paper-thin, and none of the personalities in the novel are at all memorable. This is a story about submarines and war, not men. There was a pretty good opportunity here for a subplot involving the personal life of the Captain, but the author just did not appear to be interested in going there, and the novel does not go there. This was too bad.A good sea story and I will try more of Mr. Riker's stories on my Kindle."
1,Disappointing,"After reading and enjoying Los Angeles Class I was really looking forward to this book. The plot was reminiscent of many of the excellent books by Patrick Robinson; a terrorist sub terrorizes the seas. The first part of the book was slow and tedious at times with way to much attention to meaningless detail, but with the potential for some action I kept reading. I was very interested in the new Virginia class submarine, and enjoyed the detail put into it. Some of the characters showed some promise. However, after reading the first action scene featuring the Virginia, which far exceeded the limits to believability before I was half way through it, I put the book down and started reading something else. Hopefully the book got better, but I wouldn't bet on it."
5,Sturdy,"Bought one. The day it arrived I bought a second.It's light enough my 85 year old mother can move it around in her closet, but it is sturdy and as far as I'm concerned I don't have to worry about tipping.The second was for my wife,----------and me."
4,Good utility,"I purchased this to allow us to get in and out of a minivan easier. It is just what we needed. It's very sturdy, yet lightweight enough to pull into the van after we're seated. I also like using it in the kitchen to get to the upper shelves without having to pull out the ladder. The tall handle is very helpful."
1,Not Bad!,The product was not bad. I purchased it for my mother that was having difficults getting on bed. The only problem was the handle has to be screw together half way down. It make it have little wobble in it. But acceptable
3,be prepared,"Be prepared for more grief in assembling than you might think., The instructions are not clear. After partially assembling and then disassembling and try to get poorly machined parts to align, it finally all came together. Seems sturdy enough, but when all was said and done the center screw which held the bottom assembly would not hold and fell out. I will be getting gorilla glue and possibly will use some to attach their dinky and useless little wrench to a 2x4 and mail it collect to Bejing, yes of course it's made in China."
5,good as advertised,I am perfectly satisfied with this foot stool. It is stable and sturdy and fits in a corner of my kitchen neatly.
5,sturdy worth the money,wife needs it to get in and out of SUV That was a lot cheaper than buying stepping rails for the suv.
2,Beware the odor problem...,"Structurally the stool is OK for the money. The biggest issue I have is the horrendously toxic smell coming from the foot pad - can't even describe it other than you won't want that smell in your house. And it lingers. I've had the stool outside for 3 weeks now, hoping to air it out, to no avail.Bottom line, I would not buy this stool again."
4,one minor glitch,"I'm not sure how much it would cost them to include one or two extra nuts, but one of those included had damaged thread and was unuseable. Other than that it is exactly as expected."
2,It Didn't Work For Us,"I bought this for my blind 89 year old aunt to be able to climb into a van to go to the doctors. Unfortunately, she was unable to lift her foot to climb on to the stool. It's a wonderful stool in itself...it is just that it didn't work for her and now they will have to find a new way of transportation for her. All we can do is the best we can...with love. She is keeping the stool in case someone else in the family needs it."
2,Functional but the quality is questionable.,"After reading all the glowing reviews about it's stability and support, I purchased this foot stool for my mom so she could use it in the kitchen to reach the higher cabinet shelves. What I didn't expect was it to be so poorly constructed. The rubber is peeling off the stool, the metal that goes around the perimeter has a terrible seam and the smell of the rubber is quite overwhelming. The entire room was permeated, and I had to open the windows the air it out. While all of this does not effect the stability and overall function of the product, the quality isn't worth $25."
5,Blessing in disguise,"This handy foot stool is really a bessing in disguise. My wife can only stand when she holds a walker or some other object. The support handle with this step sool is ideal for her to be able to reach her clothes in the closet, take down dishes or put them away in the kitchen cabinets. It is also handy for me to be able to put items on the top shelf of our pantry and to get seldom used items down when we need them. It is sturdy, doesn't slip, and is easy to step up on. The Duro-Med Foot Stool with support handle is exactly what we needed."
5,A Step In The Right Direction!,"The Duro-Med Foot Stool with Support Handle was delivered quickly,is exactly as pictured, and was easily put together by my husband, The Boss.Pros:Helps make the transition from sitting to standing both safer and easier.Should dizziness occur upon rising, as it sometimes does for me,it will be a steady anchor until one's equilibrium returns.The length and width of foot stool base provides ample foot/feet placement.Padded handle grip provides for added security so hand won't slide off.Handle height is ideal.Stool stays firmly in place with no wobbling or sliding on floor.Makes for getting items higher than arms reach easier.Cons: None . . .unless wishing I had ordered this much sooner counts. ~ Mrs. B. ~"
5,Good choice,"This stool is a good value, serves the purpose and great for the elderly or anyone needing a step stool. Prompt deliverly as well."
3,So so for the money,"This footstool is fine for the price. If I have to get rid of it in a few years, I won't feel that I've wasted a lot of money. I've had to tighten the handle once since it was put together. I think I may have to tighten it periodically in the future. The rubber mat is curling up at the edges. It is not secured well and probably needs to be reglued. My stool did not have the strong odor that other purchasers complained about. I'm happy that I can now reach the upper shelves in my kitchen cupboards safely."
1,Not worth $1,I had to put this together when it arrived. That was not the problem. The problem was that the holes that were pre-drilled didn't line up so I couldn't screw in one of the screws. Then the stool smelled horrible. We would have returned this but I threw out the box. Don't buy it.
1,What a Joke!!,"Please believe me, you must not buy this product. First, and worst of all, the rubber material on the foot rest smells so bad that it cannot be used indoors. The smell is of smoldering, burning rubber and extremely noxious. Second, it wobbles and is unsteady. You would think this would be an important feature on a footstool! Next, it is very difficult to assemble since the wrench provided is the wrong size. Only someone very handy with many tools will be able to assemble this ridiculous product. My problem now is how to return it. I am certainly not going to disassemble to get it back in the box. What a complete disappointment!"
3,duro-med foot stool with support handle,I could not get the bolts in the handle real tight the handle wiggles when I grab ahold of it
4,great stool,This stool is great for our needs. It helps my mom get into my SUV much easier and is very sturdy. The handle gives her the extra support she needs to make it into the truck
1,Horrible Smell,Awful smell coming from this product. Couldn't keep it in house. Had to put it outside the same day received because of the toxic smell. DON'T BUY!!! Save your money.
2,Duro-Med Foot Stool,"This stool I could not use. It has been sitting out in my garage since I bought it. I tried to use it and the smellDuro-Med Foot Stool with Support Handle, Silver/Blackwas so bad that it made me sick. What ever they put on it when they made it is still on it and I don't think I will be ever to use it. Every time we open the garage door the smell is the first thing you smell, RUBBER, RUBBER.When we got it, it was double wrapped, I guess that should have given us a clue. Anybody know how to remove rubber odor that's on the step of the stool? I bought it in September. I wrote to Duro Med but never heard from them."
1,Missing all screws and nuts,"After waiting for a week, the product finally come to the clinic, but all the nuts and screws where missing!!!! Thanks for Amazon.com, they deliver another set in the same day. Hope this time, i will get the components to put the step tool together"
4,Very good product,"This step stool is a Godsend for our family members who have trouble getting into our van. It is very stable.My only complaint is that the handle & the round legs, and the crossing point of the legs underneath, don't quite sit flat against with each other, so that the included screws are just barely long enough. But with a little perserverance, we made it work."
4,Foot stool with support handle,A very solid step stool with a study support handle. It would be even better if the support handle was about 6 inches longer so that you could stand on the step and still keep one hand on the handle.
2,Smelly,"As others have said, the instructions were not clear. The rubbery smell was just unbelievable. Either the one I got was returned, or used. Screws are too long. It is functional, but it is currently sitting outside because of the smell. If the smell doesn't go away, I'm returning it."
4,Great for a older person.,Very helpful and sturdy stool for an older person. Recommended.Nice quality - good for getting in and out od bed and reaching higher items in cabinets.
2,Hard to put together/not worth the time,"My son who is an auto tech having problems putting together and parts missing, we will be returning stool and looking for another."
2,Duro-Med Foot Stool,"The stool itself is nice. However, it came disassembled with no instructions and no hardware to go with it. When I called about it, the only response was either buy the hardware myself or send it back. They couldn't send me the hardware. I would not use this company again. This stool was bought for my elderly mother and she is not able to take care of this herself."
5,Book about the old Lebanon Hospital,"This is a very interesting book about the old Lebanon Hospital started by the Schuler sisters, and written by one of the nurses who worked for them. Since it mentions my aunt, who also worked for them, and other familiar names (to me) I really liked the book."
2,Product Not for Serpentine Belts,"Directions say ""Do not use on serpentine belts."" Though most cars now have serpentine belts, nothing in the product specs on Amazon address this. Product returned."
2,Worked on my Belt for 1 day,"Yes the direction states ""Not recommended for use on serpentine belts"" . I replaced the serpentine belt on my ranger and the new belt was very squeaky, I spray this dressing on the belt before realizing permatex recommends not using on serpentine belts. I was Squeak free for 1 day and the squeak came back. I would recommend looking for another dressing that works on serpentine belts."
2,solid gold soul 73,"Didn't recognize a lot of the artists. I graduated in 73 so I bought this to see what was going on then??? Guess I was listening to Iron Butterfly, etc. Oh, but the ones I did recognize were great!!! Ring of Gold, and Barry White..."
3,it was a gift to my 80 something year old dad,"MY dad's computer teacher recommended this book and he was pleased with it. He is a brand new user and all the language was new to him, but he is sticking with it."
2,Save your money,"For a very short book it took me a very long time to finish it. I got lots of laundry done, watched some TV, anyways the story was sweet and a nice mystery but the main female character just didn't have a backbone for 30 year old person. I almost wished they would not get together. I would pass."
3,Another gem,Excellent CD favorite track is In this Land. The legendary choir from Oakland delivers again.
1,murder to read,"I've been painfully trying to read all of Sue Henry's novels, but I think this one has finally ended my quest. Murder on the Iditarod Trail and Sleeping Lady were very good novels, but in my opinion, the rest are just dull. Murder on the Yukon Quest tells of more hardships for Jessie Arnold. It is so implausible that so much ""Bad Luck"" could befall one woman and her dogs. Alex Jensen shows up briefly in bits of the novel just to give poor Jessie something else to worry about. Sorry Sue, I can't bear to read anymore."
2,It is superbly Written... Not enough time for research?,Salmon Idaho's closest big hospital is in Idaho Falls...By Idaho's reconing of distance Salmon is nearly a suburb! If he was really ill they would sent him to Brigham Young in Salt Lake. That is mormon territory.. they have a wonderful hospital there.....The temp of Anchorage in winter is much cooler than ours in Idaho....Very good keep up the good work.. Oh by the way your typist is a pain Light has no f in it....GreatNana
2,Alaskan sled dog racing murder,"Jessie Arnold forgoes the Iditarod sled dog race to enter the Yukon Quest, a race across a thousand miles of wilderness from Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, Canada, to Fairbanks, Alaska, USA. While running in the top dozen mushers, Jessie is sidetracked by the kidnapping of a young musher, the daughter of a top breeder of Huskies. Meanwhile, Jessie's live-in lover, Alaska state trooper Alex Jensen, is called home to Idaho when his father suffers a heart attack. Juggling her personal problems with the investigation of a crime while participating in one of the most grueling physical sports takes its toll on Jessie. Henry's descriptions of sled dog racing are superb and her romantic story engrossing. However, Murder on the Yukon Quest does not measure up to the award winning Murder on the Iditarod Trail."
3,Too much mushing; not enough mystery.,"Sue Henry writes very much like what she is: a teacher of writing. Good, but a little stodgy. She also dwells overlong on description of how to hook up dogs to a sled, stow equipment, etc.Her description of Jesse Arnaold is not that of a sympathetic person; one I would like to know, which, I realize, may be my fault. The cetral coast of Oregon is as far north as I want to live!"
4,Husky Owner,Excellent book. Has suspense and also tells you about the mushing parts many people dont understand unless they race sled dogs. I really enjoyed this one.
5,Another winner by Sue Henry,"Another fantastic book by Sue Henry. Would love to join her fan club. While this one was nice to see her back with Jessie racing, I am still not sure I liked the final ending. It was again another book where I learned about cold weather surviving and just what some people would do for money. I do have to admit my new hero is Tank. I think everyone should have a human companion as faithful as the trusty Tank. You get to see Jessie interact with new characters and stand on her own feet in this one without Alex playing a large role in her racing etc... Another 5 star book"
3,Split Decision,"I love the fact that this product is rooted in the Word. It is great to get the physical benefits of yoga without the spiritual background. However, to live up to the name ""Power"" Praise Moves there was way too much stopping during the routine. In order to get the same great workout that yoga offers, the movements should stay as continual as possible. I will still use this product on one of my ""active rest days"", but do wish it offered a little more sweat."
4,good for strengthening,"My daughter and I really like this workout. As well as edifying scriptures, we are amazed at how much strength this work out takes. You can be a beginner and benefit, like us. But we realize how much we need this workout to strengthen us - Laurette must be really strong. My daughter is only 18 years old and is challenged by the moves. We recommend it for toning, strengthening, and flexibility improvement."
1,too slow for me,I was looking for something with more christian based theme music. This just wasn't what I thought it would be.
5,Great collection with superb sound quality,"Just wanted to say that this collection reflects the highlights of Twisted Sister's career. All songs are great and the digitally remastered sound quality is superb. As Dee would say, ""Play it loud, muthas""!"
2,Very cheap looking,"This is a very cheap looking bracelet. The charm isn't too bad, but the bracelet although quite ""chunky"" is very light. It certainly isn't sterling. Feels like aluminum. It's suitable for a child who's likely to loose or damage it but not for an adult."
4,Incomplete: one program missing!,This is a wonderful series but one program has been omitted: The High Ground. It included the rocket-car testing by Col. Stapp and the incredible high altitude jump by Col. Joe Kittenger who helped Felix Baumgartner make his sensational jump from 37km today. Col. Stapp went through hell with his experiments but he would not subject his staff to something that he would not do and Col. Kittenger not only had to re-pack his parachute on the way up he suffered ice-burn from a leak in his glove. I only wish that this episode and perhaps more interviews with astronaughts and NASA staff had been included with this set.
1,ruined by Cohen?,"I am a big fan of most of Jules Witcover's work, particularly his first book about Spiro Agnew. This book comes up short, however. I suspect this is largely because Richard Cohen also contributed to the book. His columns are filled with innuendo and outright logical fallacies and I suspect some of this sloppiness crept into the parts of the book on which he worked."
1,tina's list,"I have read many books on Alaska and the people who explore it. This is the first time I have felt compelled to comment on one. I have no idea what this book is about. Mr. Myers seems to have no idea what it is about either. He seems to spend all his time grumbling about the weather, about other people,even about the silence of the wilderness. He has to yell or worse fire his gun to break the silence! Then he wonders what the bears & other wildlife think about the noise he has made. He should crawl back into his storage container & stay there. Leave the outdoors to the people who respect it and enjoy it. Tina M."
4,Pancakes and Coffee,"DON'T BUY THIS BOOK --- UNLESS --- You want a real life adventure that demonstrates expert survival skills.The ability to navigate a canoe in the ocean, battling the adverse conditions of changing winds,fog and waves. Traveling alone over 300 miles in 45 days with no replenishment of supplies. His writing technique reveals that of a typical outdoorsman being plain spoken and to the point. A laymans knowledge of the perils that exist traveling the Alaskan coast is necessary for a reader to appreciate this book. There are not many who would survive this adventure. Experience unorthodox attempts to counteract loneliness and frustration in accomplishing his goals."
2,Slightly disappointing,"The book is a quick summary of a unique journey through the Alaskan wilderness. I was expecting a dramatic tale about survival along the coast line. However, it lacked details, emotions, and excitement because the author failed to expound on his adventures. Encounters with black bears and humpback whales were given the same attention as canoe packing and camp preparation. I found myself reading someone's journal instead of sharing in their daily adventures in an awesome environment.Also, the book contains several misused words and errors in calculations. For example, the ocean was described as 'placed' instead of 'placid'. An island's area was described as '20 miles by 15 miles, or 450 square miles'. After reading seven or eight of these errors, I wondered if the book was ever proof-read."
1,Defective lamp,"The lamp I received is probably a product previously returned by another customer. It's defective. One of the lamp sockets does not work. The inside of the defective socket appears to have burnt-out mark, such as wire burnt-out. I tried anyway, using light bulbs that were proven working on the defective socket, and of course, did not light up. The merchant should have taken the time to examine their product before shipping to an unsuspecting cumstmer! I am returning this good-for-nothing thing."
4,hotel look wall rack,I wanted a Hotel look Rack. I like this one. The only drawback is I have small bathrooms and it sticks out to much.
5,Great easy way to learn ballroom dancing!,"I thought this was a highly helpful video. It first shows the man's part, then the woman's, then how it's supposed to look together. It is very basic, yes, but that's why it's called an INTRODUCTION to ballroom dance. It's for beginners who want to master the basic steps. I found it very helpful, and Margot Shutz is a wonderful teacher. I thought it was fun and a good way to work out!"
2,"clear, but not enough","After reading the other 5-star reviews, my expectations were quite high for this instructional video. While I had taken ballroom dancing years ago, I would have expected a video format to be more condensed, with material to study carefully upon future viewings. What I found was a classroom style video with few challenges and even worse, other beginning level students to emulate. For an instructional video, I'd expect to see interpretations of basic dances by professional dancers. While the instruction is clear and step-wise, I found it all rather boring."
2,Bob,"The video is OK for beginners. But there is a problems. They have a lady teaching men's step, and because she is wearing high heel you cann't see the rise and fall of the feet. In certain steps the toe is supposed to land first, and certain steps the heel is supposed to land first. By wearing a high heel you can tell which one is which. Besides her heels are too high for standard ballroom dance. Get Dance vision videos each video is focused on just one dance. They will actually tell you about the heels and toes."
3,Dance,Bear in mind the tape is old but the lession in it is good for beginners. It does not contains advance steps. Recommended to a starter.
5,Good As New,Needed to replace a cracked tail light on my wife's Sienna. This product looks exactly like the original and fits perfectly. It took just a few minutes to install. I would not hesitate to buy from here again.
4,Basic Rock Fun,"A good quick exposure to Marshall Crenshaw in action. Since some of his album's were produced to a perfect polish, it's sort of fun to hear them with more edge to them. High props espcially to ""Someday Someway"" (rockier), ""Favorite Waste of Time"", ""Bruce Is King"" and ""Stay Fabulous"". Quick note - ""I'm Sorry"" is NOT ""I'm Sorry (But So Is Brenda Lee)"", but rather the Bo Diddley song. Since ""A Collection"" is apparently not in print, this may be a good way for neophytes to check out what Mr Crenshaw's all about."
4,A nice little rock-n-roll CD that actually rocks.,"If you are a fan of Marshall Crenshaw, you'll love listening to this CD of his favorite demo tapes. We like to put this CD on while we are lounging around the pool. It's fun to imagine that Marshall is out in our garage playing and practicing. This music is light-hearted, soul-warming, and just really great rock-n-roll. Phil Wilkerson, Naples, Florida."
4,Interesting Collection of Demos!,"This is a collection of demos and none of the recordings were originally considered for release. So obviously, you can't expect hi-fi sound quality; nonetheless most tracks sound very good and many songs are easily as good as Crenshaw's released album-tracks.Most songs are upbeat-pop-rockers and most of them are both fine and catchy; I especially like the two opening tracks ""Run Back to You"" and ""Someday Someway""; the latter is supposedly the only track recorded with professional equipment.Probably the stand-out is the simple, but extremely catchy ""You're My Favorite Waste of Time"", which was a minor hit for Bette Midler.Interesting how Crenshaw's voice often sound like John Lennon's."
4,Rock out,Marshall Crenshaws finest cd. All the songs are great. Pure pop songs at their finest. If this cd doesn't make you tap your foot non stop nothing will.
4,Good purchase,"I have been completely satisfied since purchasing my laptop bag. It has plenty of room for accessories, and my 15"" Dell fits perfectly. The sleek style is a nice addition, and the handles and strap are sturdy. A good product for a good price."
4,Great for the price,"I ordered the Targus Leather Notebook case for a new 17"" laptop. It looks great, has sturdy construction and plenty of room and compartments for all my cables and connectors as well as folio's and my external hard drive.All in all there are less expensive laptop cases but less space, and not leather. I feel this is worth the extra money and throw in the free shipping and it was a great deal. I am very satisfied."
4,great bag,This is a great bag. It is quite large and I can get all my stuff inside. Looks great to!!
5,Targus Notebook case-Exceptional value,"Although the Tatgus TLE400 notebook case is a bit on the expensive side, this Deluxe Leather case is well worth the extra expense. It is roomy with plenty of pockets for periferals, cords, USB drive, Power adapter or whatever. Plus a side pocket for your paperwork that will hold legal size folders and an end pocket for your cell phone. The leather is suptle and the comfortable, padded shoulder strap is angled to help stay in place. Downside, it is a bit heavy when fully loaded and the zippers are a bit stiff to use. Also it could use extra padding strips for the notebook compartment. But if you have a 17 inch notebook, this is the case for it; the only case I found that actually fits my Acer 17 inch perfectly. Or, even if you have a 15 inch notebook but need to carry legal size folders this would be the case to have."
2,I don't think it's that great.,The zipper doesn't open all the way so it is hard to remove the lap topfrom the bag. I think that if the zipper was made where you could open it all the way it was going to be a good bag for a lap top.But now you have to be careful not to scratch the lap top.I don't recomend this product if the zipper is not made so it can beopened all the way so it will be easier to take the lap top in and out ofthe bag.
3,Good Enough For The Job,Good price for a basic leather case. Not business quality by any stretch but good enough for basic transport or college use.
3,Decent Bag,"There aren't many choices out there for bags that can hold 17"" laptops, so it's a decent choice, but way too expensive. It was though, cheaper than anything I could find in the local stores (Best Buy for example)."
3,"Nice, but too big.","It's a very nice leather case, but I didnt realize that it was for 17'' notebook - it's larger than what I was looking for."
4,Leather Notebook Case,This product was devlivered on time and is in excellent condition!!! I am very happy with my perchase!!!!
1,Very Dissapointed,This bag looks very cheap and what is supposed to be leather is extremely hard. I understand it only cost $55 but I would expected much better quality. This bag is worth MAYBE $25.
3,Too Big!,"I purchased this product a few days ago, was very happy with Amazon's service and the speedy delivery even with the FREE shipping deal. However, not very happy with the product and was disappointed. I had to return it the same day I received it and purchase a smaller Targus. It was simply too big for my laptop which was only 14.1"", I got it because of the different compartments but when I got it, it reminds me of a huge portfolio bag that you would carry your drawings and sketches in.If you truly don't have a huge laptop, this is not for you!"
1,too big and look cheap,"I am not sure anyone would still use 17"" laptop. this is designed to carry 17"" laptop. I bought it because I thought it would help me carry small laptop and extra stuff, it turned out I could not do it, so I returned it."
2,"Doe not feel like a true laptop bag, most likely will scratch laptops with glossy finishes","This bag is just not for me. The bag feels more like an executive brief case and not a true laptop bag. My biggest complaint is NONE of the zippers open the bag up completely, making it difficult to remove the laptop and place larger accessories in other slots. (I knew that before ordering. I did not know it would cause this problem) If you have a nice laptop, like I do. Over time a laptop will end up scratched many times over due to the friction of pulling it over the zippers in and out."
5,Great Bag,"This bag holds everything I need. It's well cushioned around the laptop area so I don't have to worry about damaging my computer. The bag's a little heavy & bulky, but I needed something to help me carry around all my stuff. Only a heavy, bulky bag is big enough to carry around my junk :)Great bag!"
3,"Adequate, Could be Better","This case is priced right, so I can't argue with the value for the money. It's put together well and looks professional. The problem is the quality of the 'leather', it squeaks when I'm carrying it and the feel is on the cheap side. I've owned other Targus cases before that were more expensive and didn't have that cheap feeling about them. If I had it to do over, I would pass on this one and spend more to get the better quality materials. Guess that's a downside of buying over the internet, not getting to touch and feel the material before you buy."
5,This case is awesome.,"Love this case! Leather is smooth and durable, and the case has plenty of compartments and pockets for everything. My posrtable hard drive, 3 mp3 players, cables, calculator, paper, note pad...u name it. Highly recomend."
2,"Nice, but...",The inside divider literally broke within the first day of use. Overall though it is a good value for the price but severely lacking if you need long term use.
4,Great laptop case!,"I'm very happy with my purchase of this leather laptop case. One of the things I like best about it is the different compartments with plenty of room. It keeps everything I need neat and orderly. Another thing that was important to me because I carry this every day back and forth to work and home, is that it is very comfortable to carry on my shoulder. I always seem to go for something smaller because of the weight but I just end up stuffing it too much. This time I went with the appropriate size and it is no heavier then purchasing a smaller bag and stuffing it. The quality of the bag is also excellent! Very happy with my purchase."
3,"Great Case, but...",The quality of the case is good and just the right size. The only flaw is that the zipper opening for the computer is too shallow. It's difficult to get the computer out of the bag.
4,great bag for the price,"This bag was a great purchase. It has great versatility. The many compartments allow me to store all the cords and accessories I need for my latop, while allowing me to also keep other things I need with me in the bag. It makes traveling and bringing my laptop places me an ease. I love this bag! The quality, make and durabilty of the bag is outstanding and I would recommend anyone (with up an 17 inch laptop) to purchase this bag. Bringing my laptop with me is no longer a worry because I know it is secured safely within this bag. This was a great purchase."
1,Fake ratings!,"I noticed that yhou never published my review that rates the Targus TLE400 Notebook Case as a ""1""Why? You claim your ratings go from 1 to 5, yet you show zero ratings at 1 star. In my opinion this product deserves a low rating. Now I don't trust Amazon in addition to not trusting Targus."
4,Excellent quality item,PROs: - Lot of space to store your items- Excellent quality- Fits great to a 17 laptop screenCONs: - Its to heavy to carry on for long time.
5,Every Thing You Need for Your Laptop,I bought this for a Christmas present. My Brother was just Tickled! He said that it was just what he needed. Highly Recommended!!
4,A Solid Choice For The Money,"I recently bought a 17"" HP Pavilion laptop and had more trouble than I would have thought finding a carrying case to fit it. I ended up ordering, then returning two different cases to HP because they just were too cramped for a 17"" laptopThis case is a solid choice: a 17"" laptop fits with A LOT of room to spare and there are many pockets for accessoriesMinor quibbles: the shoulder strap is too small and I would have liked the case to have had a bit more padding.Overall, though, a solid choice and an excellent carrying case for the price!"
4,Great bag!,"I bought this bag half off the listed price, so I got a great deal. It is the perfect size, plenty of room. I definitely recommend this item."
2,disapointed,"The case isnt cheap so I expected it to hold up better. The handle tore at the point of attachement and I almost dropped my laptop in the street. I had only owned the case about 8 months and think it should have lasted longer. Its fancy, but not durable enough for my life style."
3,A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED,The case looked very nice on the website but when I received it I was disappointed to find that the computer had to be placed through a small opening at the top. My last case opened up to be able to lay the computer flat inside and secure it with straps.
3,MY INTRODUCTION,"This is my first time purchase from this artist , and i enjoyed most of the content on the album- Ronnie McDowell has a great voice and i will be purchasing more of his stuff-"
3,GREAT! but it broke on the first Gig man!,"PROS:It is everything it is cracked up to be. Works, adjustments are cool, Will not come lose. Hi-Hat sounds great.EXCEPT...The adjustment screw is made of hollow plastic! How strong is that?? I just happen to glance at it at mid song and the head was missing. It is not like I can just go to the local hardware store to replace it. It is a special hollow allen screw with a nylon center, meant to not wear against your Hi-Hat. So Now I guess I will be contacting AXIS to order like a DOZEN of these wimpy screws cause they WILL break again!They can break if you drop it on the ground, toss it in with the rest of your stands, hit it with a stick or look at it wrong. Bummer, cause I really like this thing. Minor annoying detail. So now I've got this brokenhi-dollar device that didn't make it thru thru the first gig. I'm back to my old trusty dinosaur Hi-Hat clutch. rrrr"
1,Worst book I've ever read!,"This book is full of errors in spelling, grammar, syntax and tense. The story has some promise, but it has suffered so from lack of editing that it is basically unreadable. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,An illustrated book on weekend projects for your Boat.,"This is a nice book, with many pages of ideas and drawings. All are fine weekend projects for the perpetual tinkerer in the Yachsman. It is not a book that you would read cover to cover. I suggest this book as an idea book or as a source of inspiration for a weekend project for your boat. The descriptions are clar and follow nicely the drawings provided. A person with this book would find it easy to make the designs shown and would most likely feel proud of their accomplished project. The only problem with this is that it would take you away from the art of sailing. therefore, I recommend it as a ""dream"" and ""basthroom"" book. A fine reference it is."
3,monster trucks,"This book was purchased for my nephew. I had the impression that the book would be larger and contain more content. Even so it entertained him. He knew the names of some of the trucks in the book, but was introduced to more."
2,Very Dated but ok,"This children's book has some very dated (mid 1980s) photography of Monster Trucks. Each photo of a truck has some caption. For example, in one photo, Bigfoot is going through mud and there is a caption that reads ""Some Monster trucks get dirty"". All in all not very good. My son who loves Monster Trucks read it a couple of times. After that, it went straight to the used book store to get something with a bit more meat."
4,Monster Trucks for my 4-year old,"This was given to my 4-year old son for Christmas 2006. He loves it and we have read it 50 times over. There are some great shots of Monster Trucks and it describes the differnet parts that make up a Monster Truck, cab, roll bar, body, tires, etc. My son wanted a Monster Turck book for Christmas nad this is exactly what he wanted."
4,Monster Truck Book,"This was bought for a friend of mines Godson who absolutely loves monster trucks. I think it's the new in thing for juniors. Anyhow, he loves flipping through and looking at the pictures. Very good childrens book, Recommended."
3,Book Size Very Small,"I bought this book for my 4 year old grand son because it was on his Amazon wish list. I don't think anyone realized how small it was when they added it to the list. I was disappointed in the size. It has easily gotten lost on the self with the more substantial books. Someone mentioned that it was more like a pamphlet and I agree. I am a big proponent of children having books from a young age but I hardly consider this a ""book"". Although any child that likes monster trucks would enjoy this book, i would not purchase it again. I would have liked at least a thicker cover and a little more substance to the book itself."
3,For what you pay...,"The meter works acceptably well although it is not real accurate. AC voltage is off by 5 volts. But for general trouble shooting, I suppose it works well enough."
2,Well It Works,I got this battery for my Dell Axim X5 and it works great except the back sticks out way too much. Next time I need a new one I'll check the dimensions first.
1,Morgan's Woman from The Bookdragon Review,"The widowed Tamsin MacGreggor sneaks into a barn to steal back her stolen horses and trips over the body of the man she accused earlier of taking her horses. Unfortunately, the body's brother is the local judge, and even though he's happy to see his brother buried, he's not going to let a horse thief get away with murder. So Tamsin takes to the hills with bounty hunter Ash Morgan on her trail. Tamsin is an airhead with occasional flashes of intelligence and Morgan is the male equivalent. This shallow western has an easily identifiable culprit, no surprises and minimal suspense in a disappointing novel by an established author.Reprinted from The Bookdragon Review."
1,Horribly Insipid,"The plot is unimaginative and thin, the characters are predictable and unsympathetic, and the romance is forced and unconvincing, lacking any real spark or passion. Any promise in the premise of the story is ruined by the stale and artificial descriptions of the American ""wild west"". The writing is unimpressive at best, falling into ramble at points. This book lacks any of the humor, tension, and tenderness that makes its genre entertaining."
4,A book to warm your heart,"Song of the Cimarron depicts everything a good historical inspirational romance should: historical authenticity, God's love and mercy, and a beautiful love story. Very well written.Kelly's characters are real. I found myself involved in therr emotions: love, hate, elation, fear, laughter, tears, pain, and redemption.I was impressed with the manner in which the hero and heroine examined their thoughts, motives, and decisions and in the process moved closer to the Lord. This impelled me to examine the inner most workings of my own heart in hopes of obtaining the same result.If the sweetness of God's love and the power of love between a man and woman inspire and lift your spirits, this is the book you must read.Highly recommended."
4,breaks up the monotony...,"hard... edgy... has some grit and even some merit... i've had this for over a year now, but really havent played it very much even tho i like it... honestly i would proly play it more if i didnt own such a large cd collection - i simply have too much to choose from to ever really sit down and lissen to this on a daily basis.i wanna give it five stars, i really do... this is a east-coast-beat-heavy disc, and i dont mind that, but i just wish there was a bit more actual JAZZ to it.that's it for me yall...yall be good.sum."
5,Five years old and STILL FRESH,"I heard a track on this CD by accident (MOTHER EARTH) and was able to find a used copy. I very rarely give 5 stars, my criterion for five stars is you have to hear something different that you discover every time you play the CD. This is one CD. It is an acid jazz classic and what other CD's and other artists of the genre aspire to......"
4,Saves you money,"This is the Tolnaftate 1% that some podiatrists want to sell you under the name ""Formula 3"" for a minimum of $45. The only difference is that this is a cream and Formula 3 is a liquid solution of Tolnaftate in Jajoba oil (which is a much weaker antifungal). Topical Tolnaftate alone is about 70% effective in cream form, so if your podiatrist recommends it, you can save some bucks here rather than paying an inflated price for the same thing. The recommended treatment time is up to 4 weeks but if you're not using good foot hygeine, nothing will compensate for that."
5,book,"Although this was an older book, it was in good condition. Pages were a little yellow, but all was just as expected. Fast service. Thank you!"
3,Did not fit my truck after it said it would,"Amazon said this would fit my 2003 Dodge Ram 1500 so, I got it. it said it only went up to 2001 so I went online and found the install info for another hitch same brand that fit my truck and did the install from those instructions. I had to get a few more bolts from the store. This took 2 hours on my back under the truck bed to install, then if you add in the searching and driving to buy the rest of the parts your looking at 3 to 4 hours. Good product in general and will fit many different applications, have not hauled with it yet, I have my fingers crossed it will hold..."
1,Vehicle Check is misleading.,This hitch DOES NOT FIT 2005 Ford F-150 XL with Vibration Damper on rear of driver side frame. Without Vibration Damper or with it removed installation requires drilling 4 holes in frame rails. Product description misleading.Customer service was very courteous and helpful arranging return.
2,Not what I expected for Orchid mix,I was incredibly surprised at the amount of potting soil in this mix. I've never seen that amount of dirt in an orchid mix before. I wish it had more bark!!! Won't buy this one again!
1,Very disappointed.,"I bought this at Walmart because my local Home Depot stopped carrying the bark mix I used, and I can't find it elsewhere locally. Phalaenopsis Orchids, the ones you find everywhere these days, require a very breathable potting medium. Preferably something very chunky with lots of bark. However, I've seen regular potting soils that were chunkier than this stuff. Others claim that phals require very little water, however, that's really not true. A couple of ice cubes will not allow a phal to thrive. They like a nice big drink, and then they like to be able to mostly dry out in a reasonable amount of time - not achievable with this mix. I definitely DON'T recommend this product."
3,Miracle Gro Orchid mix :(,I recently bought this mix for my orchids. they did very well for about 3 months when suddenly they started dying off so i took them out and looked at the roots and they were bright yellow - orange . It is too fine for orchids it builds up at bottom of orchid pot and then retains water. TERRIBLE!!!!
1,too bad,i bought this in for my orchids...can't say that it deserves even 1 star...too dense for orchid roots and all my plants suffered until i bought another soil. it stays wet all the time- kind of soil that is definitely not for orchids.
5,happy,purchased to go with the rest of a gift for someone. came in ontime was as described. great service. would order again. person seemed to be happy with it.
2,Threw this one out the window,"A weak record compared to what they've done before. These watered down Gypsi-Kengs-on-speed minus the vocals meets jazz doodlings wear on me real quick. If you want great Strunz and Farah buy ""Frontera"" or ""Guitaras"" instead."
3,If you like shoots...,"I read about this DVD on some wresting site. Someone said they liked it better than ""Beyond the Mat"". That peaked my interest, since I think BTM is a great look into professional wrestling both on the big stage and the independent venue as well.I can say that it is no ""Beyond The Mat"". There are some interesting things that hard-core wrestling fans will enjoy. I thought that Konnan & Vampiro were the best. They had the most interesting things to say. The rest was just obnoxious crap, especially the stuff with New Jack, he comes across as one big a-hole.Keep in mind there is virtually no wrestling footage on the DVD. This is truly for those that love shoots of washed up bitter guys that never made it to the WWE this is for you. Good for 1 viewing but not something I would watch over and over."
4,A Bit Goofy but Worth Watching,"I have a large collection of videos that I use for my Human Sexuality classes. This one is not the best, but for a high school age crowd it would be perfect. Highlighted is a goofy guy to display the testosterone-driven young male. Some interesting depictions of what sex really is, and some good stuff on sexuality research."
3,Cheesy,"While this has some nice visuals to look at for home ideas, and easy to understand concepts, I was just so put-off by the ""characters"" in this DVD. ""Real"" people asking questions about their homes in a casual discussion...it seemed awkward and fake. I didn't care for the delivery of information; I'd rather a person just present information and visuals to me, instead of 'acting' out a discussion regarding home design. Maybe I'm being too harsh, but I just didn't think it was enjoyable to watch."
5,Just Brilliant,"Kertesz' prose is a mordantly brilliant, penetrating exercise in self-interrogation. It is the singularity and power of a voice--a voice that carries with it a lifetime of suffering and tragedy. It is an active consciousness reflecting in on itself the reasons why, its speaker could not bring a child into the world. Although we only ever see patches of the speaker's story, an entire history presses on us with the weight and density of the entire event that is the Holocaust. Drawing on the inspired prose style of Thomas Bernhard, Kertesz brings his own particular temperament and intellectual itinerary. This is little book will take you deep into the crevices of nothingness quickly, and without any hesitation."
3,very personal account,"somewhat difficult to read, but it is one man's account and we should respect it."
2,Watch out for typos,"We reference this book quite often. However, upon trying a desert we've never attempted ourselves for the first time, the Pineapple Upside down Cake, we were disappointed. First of all, it doesn't tell you the size of the pan you should be using and then it said to cook for 20 minutes. The cake was still totally raw. We tried it for another 20 minutes and yes - still raw! (there is nothing wrong with our oven - we use it at least weekly and NEVER have food uncooked or undercooked)So, as I type, the cake is still in the oven and we will see if it ever cooks! I would love to try it, because the edges tasted great and the batter was yummy. I really would love to have the proper cooking time but I will be trying a recipe from another book if I want to eat a cooked cake!"
2,Cookbook for me,"I'm so glad I purchased this book for myself because I took the word of a used book seller that it was in 'Like New' condition. Big mistake. The whole spine was broken away from the book, and it was shipped in a PAPER BAG. Don't most people ship in a carton??? Lesson learned. I repaired it, but will never order a used book again. Martha Schulz"
5,Wanted??,"Why is Mud Blossom wanted?? What did she do?? In this book a dog named Mud Blossom who is accused of eating Junior's pet gerble. But in the story a very old lady named ""Mad Mary"" is missing!!! Did Mud eat the gerble, and has ""Mad Mary"" been kidnapped? Read the book to find out.~Andrew Leace"
3,Better than the American version.,Lots of fun with a serious under current. Much better than the American version which was based on it. Good entertainment!
2,no good,"I should have known that ""free"" was too good to be true. Yes, the device is comfortable enough, but who cares if it's comfortable if the person on the other end can't hear what you are saying.I have used this for one day, am putting it in the garbage and ordering a 'real' handsfree device."
3,Works well when not dropping calls,"The sound quality of both incoming and outgoing on this phone is good. The battery life is as promised. The headphone is comfortable and stays in place. I do have problems though, where I get a message that the bluetooth signal is weak and I lose the connection. This occurs even when the phone is in my shirt pocket. Also, because of the behind the ear design, this headset does not stay in place as well if you where glasses."
1,This Item Was No Good it did not work well,This item did not work well.You sent me a replacment and it did notwork well . Call the Mfg they do not mak it any mor and do not tec support it.
3,worth purchasing it but.................,i bought 2 of them one for me and another for my friend. it is very easy to use with an aesthetic design. only problem with it is ver low microphone sensitivity. when i talk to someone using it i can barely hear voice clearly and also the person on the other side of phone is not able to hear my voice clearly(its just like noise)
1,piece of junk,Just coz amazon is giving for free..dont count on it..its a piece of junk. buy a motorola one..thats much better
2,Pretty low end,"I got this headset for free with a T-Mobile V360 activation on amazon. As a free throw in it's been adequate, but don't go out and buy one yourself. Some people I've spoken to with it have heard me well enough, but others said it was a struggle to hear me. Either way I had to talk louder than would be ideal if I hadn't been alone in my apartment or car.I haven't seen any bluetooth headsets with uniformly excellent reviews, so I don't pin all the blame on the BlueVoice, but I do think its quality is on the lower end of what's available. I'm now going to try out a Motorola HS820 to see how that works, thus ending my monthlong experiment with the BlueVoice."
1,So bad its not worth having.,I already had a Motorola HS800 (i think thats the model) and it works great. I got this free with my RAZR. The thing is horrible. It crackles and people complain with inability to hear me. This will go in a drawer until I find some sucker to take it.
1,GARBAGE,"Do not waste your money. I took a chance thinking this may be a bargain. Purchased for $40. I can hear others very well, but everyone I speak to has problems hearing me. Very aggravating to use. Sometimes you get what you pay for"
2,Lower-end quality,"The main complaint is simply that the people I called always complained it was hard to hear me. The headset was used with Motorola V360 and was thrown in as a freebie. I don't know if this is due to the phone (which is new) or the headset, but at this point I cannot use the headset, period."
1,Not for use with Motorola v557,"Had two of this units thinking somthing was worng with the 1st. Could not be heard well on either of the two using my new v557. I have a logitech that works fine but is bulky, the Earglove is built for comfort. I could also hear callers well,they just can't hear me which makes it useless. I plane to try it with my son's Nokia before sending it back. It does fit well.Chris G."
1,DON'T BUY IT FOR MP3 PHONES -- IT CANNOT PLAY AT ALL,"I was excited when I got my EarGlove BlueVoice headset with a new Motorola V360 that has an MP3 playback function. But I became totally frustrated when I started to try. I had some difficulty pairing the headset with the cell phone, but what's terribly worse is that the headset cannot play MP3 at all, not only the MP3 songs you have downloaded into the phone but also the hi-fi ring tones. All music and ringtones are totally inaudible.I have to give up using the earglove bluevoice headset and use the MP3 function with the wired earphone. It is a terribly awkward and frustrating given that I have chosen the cell phone and the headset for MP3 playback especially.Any idea how to fix it? Or any replacement bluetooth headset worth buying?"
1,Avoid This Device,"Difficult for the person on the receiving end to understand, impossible to train, very bad voice recognition."
1,Absolutely TERRIBLE with the RAZR VC3!,"It came free with the phone so fortunately I can't complain too much, but it is absolutely terrible. The sound is continually garbled and it cuts in and out, making it practically unintelligible. A fun toy to try for the first time for free, but now it's going in the trash and I'm buying a 'real' bluetooth headset."
1,Infra red blue tooth?,"I used this product one day.Everyone i talked to complained about it. It works ok if the two devices are no more than 3 ft from each other and in sight of one another. When i called coustomer support using the device the Rep. said we had a bad connection,so i turned off the device and the connection was clear. The Rep. then gave me the run around, something about buying it through Amazon so they wernt responsable and i needed to take it up with them. So you might say im not happy with my purchase"
2,Lousy microphone,"The headset fit well and was fairly comfortable. I could hear people fine, but had to shout for them to hear me (even in a quiet room with the boom extended). I returned it within a few days."
1,performance,"i think it is useless, it works only in very close vicinity to the device otherwise too much noise. If u r talking to someone, they dont hear you well.I dont recommend this device although it is relatively cheap."
2,There's a reason Amazon is giving it away for free,"Mediocre to horrible I would say. First of all, DO NOT get anywhere near a laptop with a wireless card or a running microwave oven because your bluetooth connecting will drop at the drop of a hat (no pun intended).Secondly, while the earpiece sound quality is acceptable, all people that I talked to using this headset have commented that I sound like if I was talking out of a ""toilet bowl"". Horrible microphone quality.Only reason I give it two start is because of low price, and its free if you get a new plan/phone from amazon. Otherwise, get a motorola or something built with more quality if you can spare a few more bucks. This thing WILL annoy you."
4,Bang for the Buck,"I've used this headset for a few months now and it works fine for me. You could go with a more expensive headset, but for my basic needs this was perfect."
3,The product is good except that the battery life is very short,"The product is good except that the battery life is very short. It is quite a handy product especially when you're traveling or driving. Another problem I found with the product is that the voice seems like I'm speaking on speaker mode on my phone. Also, the charger is a little bulky and the manufacturer can surely shink it down."
1,Worst BT headset on the market,I got this along with my LG PM-325 Sprint phone. It never syncs correctly and shuts off all the time in between calls. Do not buy this item unless you want a perpetual headache. It is more dangerous to drive using it than just talking into the handset. I am always trying to get it to turn back on even if it has only been seconds between calls.
5,No one can hear me!!!!,"As some mention, don't bother spending your money on this one. I can hear people fine but no one can hear me. It's more of an aggrivation to use it then not. Find something else, I am."
1,One word: JUNK,"This unit looks great and seems like a terrific design, but unfortunately, it works horribly. Don't waste your money."
5,Fantastic!,"This is indeed a fantastic little book. It contains all the colloquial Italian you could need for a short visit or even a long stay in Italy. I just returned from a langauge school in Rome and I wish I had this book with me. It's Italian as the natives speak it - not as they teach you in school. I found a lot of phrases I had to discover on my own from Italian friends.One warning - If you are a complete beginner, this book does not contain pronunciation guides for the words/phrases. You'll want to supplement this with a beginning Italian text that includes basic pronunciation. Otherwise, this book is a dream!"
5,What They Can't Teach You in School...,"Any student of the Italian language is sure to get a rise out of ""Hide This Book: Italian"". As with the rest of the ""Hide This..."" series, this volume teaches those of us without a native tongue what (not) to say in the presence of normal society in Italy. It is as much for beginners as it is long-time bookbusters wishing to evade the inevitable social rebuttals of mispronunciation and assumed innocence of vocabulary. Not for children. Not to be passed up!"
4,Great tool for throwing off your Italian speaking friends...,"This book is a lot of fun. It's got some interesting words and phrases for those who are just learning the language. But, it's even more fun to use the items learned in this book to throw off your Italian speaking friends who don't think you know ""slang"" or other custom Italian phrases."
4,"scary story, amazing music","I just saw the weather channel show about North Carolina and Trond's ""survival at sea."" I was interested in what sort of ""inspirational music"" he made and must say that this guy's sound comes from some pretty amazing experiences. Now I want to know the story behind each and every score. If you get a chance, catch his Atmospheres episode or better yet, take a listen to his unique sound and just close your eyes."
2,Not the best,For the price I paid it is not that great of a product. Takes forever to grind the right amount you need.
1,ONEIDA MORRISON BEAUTIFUL,"I WOULD LIKE TO OWN THIS PRODUCT BUT, IT HAS BEEN ON ORDER SINCE 2-4-07 AND I AM STILL WAITING. FOR ME, IT WAS PURCHASED AS ONE OF THE BEST BUY PROMOTIONS. BUY THE 45 PIECE SET AND GET THE 20 PIECE SET FREE. THAT WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME 12 PLACE SETTINGS THAT WOULD MEET MY NEEDS. NOW I AM STUCK WITH 8 SETTINGS...NOT WHAT I CALL BEST VALUE. THE PRODUCT HOWEVER IS OF GREAT QUALITY. BEAUTIFUL, GOES WITH EVERYTHING AND THE WIEGHT IS VERY IMPRESSIVE. I JUST WISH I HAD MORE SETTINGS."
2,book by liberals,the title says it all. typical university attitude that people want and need government to help them out. reading this book makes me wanna puke
5,ted lowi,"This is not a review. I'm trying to reach Ted Lowi. If anyone has an e-mail address, please contact me at Richjoansf@aol. or otherwise tell me how to reach him. Thanks"
1,"Faith, Courage, Wisdom, Strength and Hope",This book was such a waste of my money. Many words to the poems repeated themselves and I found so many misspelled words or words left out it was ridiculous. I threw this book in the trash. Can't believe it wasn't edited before publishing. Not recommended.
5,Beautiful Positive Motivation!!!!,"This book is all Beautiful Positive Motivation!!!! We need as much Positive Inspiration as possible, MORE, MORE, MORE!!!!!!These beautiful poems are full of Love and Hope!!!!Stacey wants to Encourage all to have Wonderful Feelings of Happiness,Nothing wrong with that! I enjoyed this book, well worth buying, and would definitely recommend to others! :-)"
2,"The wedding band demo tape - ""We can play the Stones, too!""","I heard one of the cuts on this album on Pandora and, for the life of me and after two listenings, I can't figure out which one it was. This thing sounds like a middling band's claim to be able to play the Rolling Stones tunes at your kid's bar mitzvah. Or maybe it was a group on Lawrence Welk that was playing some and thought they could make an album out of it. They were wrong."
5,Brilliant scholarship.,"The author has done a brilliant job of researching and presenting to the lay public the history and archeology of the Temple Mount. This book is a definite must read for those interested in the subject. -Prof. Albert Bressnan, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland"
1,clip broke,The clip broke from daily use. i seldom use this case and when i do its at work (office job) im glad it fell off when i was sitting here or the phone would be gone too. Kool Kase is another brand with the same design. i would skip and get a rugged brand. This was a nice looking case.
5,An Excellent Excellent Book,This book is a very easy read. It is thought provoking and at the same time humourously written. Once you pick it up you won't be able to put it down until you have read it from cover to cover.It presents a well-thought out critical analysis of the central beliefs of the Jehovah's Witnesses. It is a must read for anyone thinking of joining this group or of breaking free from its bondage.
5,20 questions Jehovah's witnesses cannot answer,Easy to read. I couldn't put it down once I started to read it. Powerful yet very loving.
3,Dull Spots!,I think this subject is interesting so long as the writer keeps it that way. There are times in this book that the author seems to get off the subject and seems to just insert the topic casually as if to remember there was a purpose for the book. It is an easy read and could be put down in about an hour.
2,"Lots of valuable information, but....","This is one of the better books for me that is a non-reader because it was easy to get through. The topics were fast paced. The negative that I have with the book is that it focused too much on the ""great crowd"" and not other subjects. There were times that the author would poke a stick in Judge Rutherford's side now and again and it left the taste of bitterness in my mouth, otherwise was an informative book."
1,You guys are all dumb,"You know what's funny, you guys write all this about JW's and talk alot of crap about how they know nothing, and they are all wrong. So why don't we write a book about the born agains, catholics, jews, muslims, everything huh. Everyone has their own beliefs, and iif you don't believe anything that the JW's say, then why get your panties in a bunch. It's funny cause you guys are writing books about them and you all seem to care so much about them, but since you all hate them and think they're wrong, then why don't you not talk a bout em or just get a life. That works. GET A LIFE PEOPLE!!! Writing 5 paragraph reviews on Amazon. Wow."
1,ULTRA - JUNK!!!!!!,"JUNK, JUNK, JUNK. I'd rate this product ZERO STARS! if it was possible. As another reported, AA batteries are too big and do NOT FIT into many devices correctly. 3rd or 4th time I used the charger that came with the batteries it significantly overheated and I believe would have caused a fire. I threw the whole mess in the garbage where it belongs. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK OR ASSOCIATED CHARGING DEVICES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not Recommended,"I have been buying these before (from Microcenter). They are very cheap and I thought it was a very good deal. Particularly their 2600mAh for 5 bucks! But...Cons:-Of all the NiMh batteries I tried. This has the most number of failures. Some just dies. Some would hold very low charges after just a few cycles.-It is bigger in circumference compared to other batteries. Which will not fit some of my cameras and gadgets.-Exterior is made of paper and gets easily smashed, deformed.Pros:-Price. but for this kind of quality... not worth it.Also: With all the new low discharge batteries flooding the market (Eneloops, Rayovacs, Duracell, Kodak, etc.) There is no longer any reason to buy this kind of batteries. Even this company is now manufacturing their own Hybrio."
5,Family Tree Page Ideas For Scrapbookers,I make many scrapbooks thru out the year and this book will help me make a scrapbook of all the family reunions that we have every year
1,NY yankees paperweight,"This item was overpriced and undersized,, i was very disappointed with it,, as it was intended to be given as a gift, no dimensions were specified and it was sadly miniscule,, looked like a dollar store item, please beware of free shipping I guess"
4,yankee stadium crystal pyramid,very nice. excellent workmanship. illusion very interesting. appears a little smaller than i thought but overall very satisfied
3,Uneven,"This collection of essays is uneven in quality. Heather Barr's ""Policing Madness: People with Mental Illness and the NYPD"" is outstanding. It is well written, even-handed, and reflects the frustration of my own law enforcement experience. Most of the other essays are not so clearly written or reasoned. Taken as a whole, the book does not give a precise sense of where we should go when competing personal and social interests are taken into account. Since the concept of ""Zero Tolerance"" is such an idiotic and painful assault on what it is to be human, I was disappointed."
5,Great stuff,"I can't compare to other products because this is the first i've used, although i'm certainly pleased with the results i've obtained. As other people have stated, a little goes a long way, don't use too much and have it go to waste. I've gotten compliments from friends asking what i use to clean up my wheels. I recommend using it after your wheels have been washed down, dried, and then use the polish with two microfiber towels, one towel for applying and buffing out the stains, and the other for wiping off the residue and polishing."
2,ehh,its ok. I thought this was way better than the regular one but its the same thing just different bottling. i tried blue magic metal polish cream and its makes my aluminum rims look way better and in half the time. For any one considering this i suggest the blue magic. I got got a buddy that suggested to me mothers to switch to blue magic
4,Very relaxing tea,I bought this tea after learning more about Ling Zhi and Reishi as adaptogenic herbs. This has a mid flavor and is quite relaxing
5,The Greatest CD I have ever owned,"I don't know of any other artist who has been able to master the art of blending tranditional jazzy horns and electronic beats as well as Krush does. He has a way of doing it with an almost ethnic flavor thats hard to discribe.Anyone who has listened to this CD has fallen in love with it. DJ Krush's other stuff is great, but this is exponetially better then his, or any other Acid Jazz artist."
4,Solid but only for enthusiasts,"This Krush album is quite good, however it's not his best effort. I might be holding him to higher standard. It is his first major release so you hear traces of the genius that would come years down the road. Personally I think its missing something. Start with Meiso and Millight.Keeping the Motion, Into the Water and especially Big City Lover are standouts."
3,"Good, but a little short.","Dissappearances is a good book for the 8 to 12 age group. A little short, it is entertaing, as it has stories that are hard to find elsewhere. I would recomended it to any one who is interested in the subject of unsolved dissappearances. ...."
4,Elegant watch,"This watch is very pretty and it works well. It's a nice little accessory as well as a good way to tell time, so it does the job. My only complaint is that it doesn't have a date function, and even though I knew that when I bought the watch, I still miss it. I haven't tested the water resistance of the watch much, but so far it has survived dishwashing and other light splashing.(Of course, the strap was way too long when I got the watch, but that is to be expected. I just took it to Macy's and they removed the extra links free of charge. It's a relatively simple thing to do yourself, but I just didn't have the right tools.)"
2,Underwhelming prettiness,"2 1/2The kind of overall quality that relatively exists though leaves much satisfaction to be desired, this is an attempt to take something like The Cranberries alternative rock and mold it with a harder edge, but there just is not much talent here to bring out any oomph inside near-boring compositions."
5,Great buy,"I decided to buy a vegetarian cook book to try and cook mostly vegetarian at home. The recipes were delicious, quick, easy and healthy too. I've decided to only eat vegetarian at home because of this book and am now collecting Atlas's other books.edited - february 2010 -- I wanted to edit my review because its been a few years since I wrote this. I still use this book a lot when I'm in a hurry and when friends and family are thinking of fitting more meatless meals in their week, I usually lend this book to start. Its not overwhelming and there aren't a lot of highpriced and ""scary"" vegetarian ingredients for a new vegetarian cook. I've become much more adventurous in vegetarian cooking but I still come back to this for a quick and easy meal."
4,Great for quick ideas,"I use this cookbook as a springboard to quick and healthy meals. I don't always follow the recipes exactly, but the recipes give me awesome ideas for throwing together quick cheap meals from whatever happens to be in my fridge.Maybe I will add a some garlic or replace a fresh ingredient for a frozen or canned one, but I use it all the time. I am so glad I bought it!I don't have a lot of time or money, and this book helps me cook in a hurry, without having to run to the store for 500 pricey ingredients. Buy it!"
2,Bland Food,I loved the concept of this book but after trying a number of recipes I now believe it may take more than 5 ingredients to add flavor because these dishes are B-L-A-N-D.
2,Less than optimal layout,"I just received this book yesterday, and am not rating the content, rather the physical characteristics of the book itself. I am giving it 2 stars because the printing of the recipe titles and instructions is so light I can barely see it. I don't think I'll be able to use this after the sun goes down!"
3,christmas gift,Book got here as expected. Was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she has yet to open it yet
3,"vegetarian cook book , okay","I haven't tried the recipes yet , but they seem a little boring. Very easy to do however, as there are few ingredients."
3,5 Ingredients? Yes. Gourmet? No.,"I am definitely not the most experienced or gifted cook around, but this book was a bit too basic, even for me. As someone who eats strictly vegetarian, I own a few veggie cookbooks, and this is the one that gets the least use. Most of the recipes are solidly mediocre. A couple are pretty bad. None have been outstanding so far--though to be fair, I have yet to try every single one. In sum, if you are going for very quick and easy, you may like this cookbook. But if you are looking for a little inspiration in a recipe, this is probably not the book for you."
4,Indespinsible.,"This is a fantastic cookbook. Not only does it have great recipes (which are ready in a flash, more often than not, as well as being brief in the ingredients), it encouraged me to remember that the best dishes I serve are often the ones in which a very few items shine forth in their best light. Handy for anyone, vegetarian or not, but especially for the cook who wants to whip up a veggie dish without breaking the bank at the market."
3,ITS OKAY,"This was for my sister but i looked in it. It had some weird stuff in it but its super healthy, which is what my sister wanted...so all is good"
1,Not a crockpot cookbook,I searched for vegetarian crockpot cookbooks in the Amazon search bar. This book was fifth on the list and got the best reviews. It didn't occur to me that it might not be a slow cooker cookbook. It is not.
1,Bottom of the line,"Think product is of poor quality,appears cheap made. Operation is erratic at best. No FM radio connectors for outdoor antenna, a must for rural areas. Turn table won't hold steady speed while playing LPs'"
2,SHE done better!,"I love Shannon Drake.But,she went over board with the viking issue.Every page ,you needed to read about Mellyora being a viking.It really got very boring.After the first chapter ,we got the point she was a viking.I have read all her books,she's awesome,but this book was boring and to much to the point of viking history .what happen to the romance?"
4,easily enraptured,"I am always eager to pick up a new Shannon Drake/Heather Graham novel, and I'm glad I picked up this one. The plot unfolds rather quickly as the reader is introduced to Laird Lion and later Mellyora and they take on the usual characteristics of hero/heroine in a Drake novel. but that's what makes the book exciting. Granted, some of the events are easily foreshadowed, but Drake does it in a way that has some kind of twist. Another aspect of her novels is the reference to historical events. Mentioning all of the wars and personalities lends a truthfulness that make her tales fantastically beautiful. I have a hard time keeping myself from searching for a new Drake novel that I have not yet read!"
2,Ugh!,"This was my first Shannon Drake book. I read several reviews here that made me think that this book was a fluke, so I had planned to try others. But the ones who said THIS was her best yet convinced me to save my money. I know my favorites (Johanna Lindsey and Julie Garwood) are hard to live up to, but still, I've read alot of good books. This was not one of them. If I want to read a history book, I'll buy a history book. I read as afr as page 193, and there was still no sexual tension between the two. I just can't finish it."
2,Not quite what i was expecting.,"The review i read hiked the ""he barged into her castle to claim her and her land"" theme, but it wasn't so. The beginning of the relationship- the fiery exchanges, were all so long and unbeleivable that i wanted to hurl the book out my window. They love-making was more like ""she likes it rough and he likes giving it to her."" It's unbelievable that they fall in love, or that they even marry, even if he lusts after her. The hero's character does not stay in the expected character. Very dissappointing and quite a turn-off"
3,Bloodthirsty,"Mrs. Graham/Drake was in a bloodthirsty mood when writing this novel. But the violence and bloodshed, though graphic, was mediocre, failing to capture the reader, beckoning her/him to turn the page. I actually put this book down, something I seldom do when reading Graham or Drake. But even upon completion of the novel, I found that the characters never became actual heros or heroines, in my opinion. Historically typical, his fathering an heir was more important than a loving relationship with his reluctant bride."
4,Romance with a history lesson...,"This is my first Shannon Drake book, so I didn't quite know what to expect. This book differs from other historical romances I've read, in that it reads like a ""story"" that happens to have romance as one of the primary focal points. It's not the typical historical romance where the focus is on the beauty of the ""fair maiden,"" the prowess of the male character, and their sparring matches before they realize they're meant to be together. Sure there's some of that here too, but there's a story as well. This is evidenced by the length of time it takes before the two characters even kiss. I guess this is more of a ""mature"" historical romance. However, it was enjoyable enough that I'll try another of her books. While I still prefer the ""typical"" historical romance, the bottom line is, would I recommend it? The answer is yes, as long as you don't expect a novel similar to some of Kathleen Woodiwiss' best (and older) novels."
5,Excellent Book!,This was my first Shannon Drake book and have already bought the next 4 books in this series. It's excellently written with plenty of facts about the history of Scotland to make it very easy to understand. This is different from other historical romances that I've read because it actually has a ton of historical facts to thrill a curious mind while bringing the characters and this time alive. I loved how I was able to envision the landscape and the characters without being bogged down with too much description. I recommend this book too anyone interested in the medieval times and in Scotland. I look forward to reading the rest of her books in this series.
5,Makes all the difference!,"It is amazing how much bigger my shower space seems with a curved shower rod. If you have big family members, it is a must have. This one is very stable, too. Definitely recommend a rod that needs to be anchored than the kind you wedge in."
4,Nice product,"It is a nice looking shower rod, but because of the curvature you will need a solid backing, or the rod will eventually come out of the wall. If you know what you are doing, the installation goes quickly. You have about 2 inches to play with to adjust your measurement. One thing that I found sub-par on this item is the Allen set screws that hold the bar in place. The Chinese drilled the holes so slapply, and the screws were of such poor quality that I ended up re-tapping the holes and getting new screws."
4,Best one I can find.,The mounting hardware is the best I've found so far. Very sturdy and well designed. No overlaping tubes on the rod so the shower curtain glides smoothly when you pull it closed.
1,Caution; read before purchase,I spent two hours unpacking and putting this machine together. I then used it for 13 minutes at the lowest level at which time the internal drive belt (factory installed) came off. I recommend you do not buy.
2,only a flashcard,"I thought I was buying a book, but this is little more than local bird flashcards. It folds out like a map with pictures and info on both sides. It seems a bit childish also."
4,Wonderful quick guide for new birder,"I wanted to replace a very old and faded bird chart that had hung by my kitchen window for years, and I came across two or three of these laminated fold-up charts. The Peterson charts have the largest illustrations, and are really engaging. I keep these references right by the den window for ease of use, and they have been a solid addition to my birding library, and as I've shared my love of birds with new observers.Highly recommended for older children as well as adults who'd like a quick visual reference. I'm planning to give one with a bird-feeder as a gift, along with a bag of region-specific seed."
2,...,This is not a vary good book. There are more informitive books out there. And this is not one of them.
4,Dave Miller's Homebrewing Guide,I have retired and added this to my bucket list This book gave the info that I need to start.. Check back in a year and if I survive my brew
4,Homebrewing guide,Dave's book is very complete but a little too technical for a pure beginner. I have been brewing for 30 years and most of the material is great but not for the beginner.I have enjoyed the book and will tell our club members about it.
2,Nice but mostly useless,"Buy this book if you want to have another beer book to read or you are an advanced brewer who whats to learn more about chemistry. Don't buy it if you want to get useful informations on how to actually ""do things"". He talks a lot about the general aspects of brewing but without giving you any practical advice or formulas.This book definitely aims to the advanced home brewers who really already know what they are doing and specially the equipment section and recipe section might scare the beginner away."
2,Just read the Homebrew web sites.,"The book repeats many of its points two and three times giving the feel that the author was looking to hit a certain word count. It then goes on to spend a paragraph of sparging and doesn't even mention batch sparging. Towards the end of the book I found myself just skimming then when it talked about how bad aluminum was for beer I just put it down, this book was published in 95 and the science has moved along way since then."
3,Packed with information yet intimidating for the novice,"I confess that I've yet to read it from cover to cover but this book does seem to have a lot of valuable information. It seems to me that probably every needed area is covered but it may be too much information at once for someone who would like to try brewing for the first time. I guess that the information is there, it's just that there is so much else (probably all worthwhile)included that the timid novice might feel like abandoning the attempt."
2,dissapointed,"I was really looking forward to watching this HD-DVD. The video is great, the performances are great, but I can't believe it is only offered in stereo. Who would record a concert in 2.0 sound when your shooting video in HD? There is no reason this should not have been done in 5.1 surround format."
5,"Loved it, Loved it, Loved it!","As a James Taylor fan, this DVD is a real treat to watch. The performances of the songs were fabulous ( personal favorites were the Dixie Chicks, India Arie, and Keith Urban's version of Country Road). It's great fun to watch James and his wife and twin sons amid this star studded and glamorous audience - watching the DVD you really feel a part of this wonderful event. I recommend this for the true longtime fan, and even for one who just enjoys his music from time to time. The final encore of James singing Fire and Rain was a poignant ending to a wonderful evening of music."
4,JT fan since I was 10,"Nobody does JT songs like the man himself. I was very happy the end of the show included JT doing some very good and classic songs. Carol King was great, Sting's kind words were much better than the rendition of the JT song he did.Overall a nice addition to my JT collection"
4,A Musicates Person of the Year Tribute,"I'm a fan of James Taylor so for me, his muscial guests werejust a added bonus. I enjoyed it very much."
1,Tribute Honoring James Taylor,Disc does not play in and BD or DVD player. Also tried in a computer and various friends players. Could be a European format? Went to a good cause but would have preferred to see it.
1,One good song.,"I haven't seen the whole special. Forgive me, I'm not much of a James Taylor fan. However, Bruce Springsteen's performance of ""Millworker"" was one of the best things I've seen/heard on television in a long time. The problem? It's not available on CD and they even took his individual performance down off of YouTube. Thinking, ""Okay, maybe I'll try the James Taylor version and see if it's any good,"" I went to download that. The problem is that it sucks. Bruce's version is a thousand times better and doesn't sound like easy listening. Somebody put this DVD on CD or MP3 just so I can get the one good song that James Taylor ever had anything to do with! Seriously, the song Bruce did is so good that I'm entertaining the idea of paying 18 dollars for the DVD JUST SO I CAN HAVE IT."
1,Bad product James taylor musician of the year dvd Did not work,I was so disapointed to receive this item and find that it does not work. I do not know if it is a boot leg copy or what but it will not play in any dvd players! I do not know anything about this seller but I will stay clear from now on.
1,DVD doesn't play,"I have tried 2 different copies of this DVD, neither one would play. Has anyone else had this problem?"
1,FLAT OUT BAD,"Doesn't anyone else hear it? The man is FLAT!... both musically and emotionally...and painfully so. Tom Postilio even manages to strip the heart out of the beautifully sad ""We Live on Borrowed Time"". I can't believe people praise him and compare him to Sinatra. If you're looking for a cabaret singer in the style and voice of Sinatra, try Charles Cermele"
2,Why bother with this?,"Tom Postilio has got a nice voice, but he apes Sinatra so much, it's barely worth listening to him. Go and dig out one of Frank's original albums rather than spend your time listening to a soundalike. Postilio also doesn't have as much rhythm as Sinatra (or Bobby Darin), so the uptempo songs kind of fall flat. I would pass on this disc."
5,Outstanding CD!!,"I love this CD ""DREAM"" by Tom Postilio, I have his first CD ""What Matters Most"" it is so good to have a new CD to listen to. I got the wonderful chance to see him at the Algonquin Hotel in the fall of '98, got to see him at the Plush Room in the York Hotel spring of '99. I purchased this CD and one of my favorite song is ""I could marry the rain."" I would highly suggest to anyone who loves the sound of Frank Sinatra buy this CD and ""DREAM"""
4,Wet Fly Ways,"Generally, I'm not given to flowery oratory about video products. To be sure I have my favorites just like anybody else. But in the case of Mr. Wotton's offering I must say it is a very well done product. The camera work is very good to excellent. The backdrops and riverine scenery are wonderful! The commentary and technical discussions will be of help to just about anyone who has an interest in expanding their knowledge of fly fishing and particular aspects of this wonderful pass time. There is much to be learned here but the almost textbook chapter format of the video lends itself well to constant referencing of a particular subject or technique. For my part I'm very glad I stumbled across this very well done tutorial. Thank you."
5,Awesome!,"A must have for anyone who wants to learn wet fly fishing from an expert angler.Wotton is a master of traditional wet fly techniques,and this will anyone a better fisherman."
4,GhostTown w/Ricky Gervais,"Very funny move. Not the typical ghost movie where the spirit comes back and takes over another body. More like Ghost, as the spirit has unfinished business, just not sure what tho. No drama or chills here...just loads of laughter.Ricky Gervais was the co-creator of ""The Office"" in England. He is also a stand-up comic. Very Funny."
4,Very watchable!,"Not my normal type of movie - but it's very watchable and funny too! Yes, you know from the start what's going to happen, but it's still an enjoyable ride getting there. The quirky humor alone makes this movie."
2,DISAPPOINTING!,"As a big fan of Ricky Gervais I expected this to be quirky and very funny. Tea Leoni is an excellent comedic actor as well. But ... this film didn't really do anything. The odd smile, but no laughs and somehow no real heart. The concept was great and should have provided many possibilities for a very funny and heart-warming film - it wasn't."
4,"Starts Rocky, But Finds Its Heart","Greg Kinnear and Ricky Gervais star in this very well constructed, heart-warming film about a man who discovers one day that he is able to see and hear spirits. For some, this would be a blessing; for the main character, it's a horrible curse. He is a very cynical, pessimistic, self-centered man that tries to ignore the spirits. All he wants is for them to elave him alone so he can go about his normal miserable quiet life.But the more and more he interacts with them, the more his heart opens, little by little. This film may bring you laughter and/or tears, as well as help awaken you to your own heart's desires. See what happens as seeming tragedy slowly turns into a miracle with ""Ghost Town"". Oh yeah, and just when you think you know what happens... well, think again!"
2,The supporting cast were the best part of this movie,"The actors & actresses playing supporting rolls were the best part(s) of this movie, in between 2 boring male lead actors and Tea Leoni. The actors who played various ghosts were interesting, funny & entertaining - making me wish I could watch more of them & less of Ricky Gervais. The old gag reflex shtict - (Ricky Geravis' character had it throughout the movie),just made we want to gag too. I rented it, but didn't even bother to finish the last 1/3. I seriously doubt it suddenly became worthy of the time I had already expended."
4,Ghost Town Review,"We loved this show and would give it 4.5 stars. It was very funny. Gervais, Leoni and Wigg are great."
4,Refreshingly clean and funny,"Witty and clean, entertaining comedy, with a heart! A little slow moving but still worth watching. No big meaning to it, just very entertaining."
4,Dad's Favorite,"I picked this up for my dad for Christmas, as it is one of his favorite movies. We all love it! There are a lot of hilarious moments that don't interfere with a decent story line. Ricky Gervais is one of my favorite actors"
4,Great find!,Only heard about this movie recently...don't know how I missed it. Really enjoyed it...Gervais with a gag reflex had me rolling on the floor!
3,"Enjoyable Comedy, Very Touching Ending","This movie is very enjoyable, especially for someone from New York, who can appreciate the deep sarcastic humor of the Ricky Gervais character. I found the scenes toward the end of the movie very, very touching. If you liked Ghost (Patrick Swayze)or Hearts and Souls (Robert Downey Jr, the same feelings are evoked."
4,Laugh out loud,"I liked this movie a lot and laughed out loud in several places. There was a lot of drier more british type humor at times, but i love that.I didn't know anything about this movie but blockbuster recommended it and I am very glad i watched it.It is mostly a light hearted comedy, however, there are themes could also hit some chords with folks, touching on serious issues. There were some moments of slowness (maybe about 15 or so minutes), but the overall feel of the movie is funny.I would definitely recommend this movie if you want to laugh, have a date night, or are interested in psychology."
4,Ghost Town by Brandon M. Moskos,"I love movies, so I pre-ordered Ghost Town because of all the positive reviews the critics gave it. I wasn't disappointed at all. The acting is great, Greg Kinnear is as great as always and there is more humor in this movie than I thought. This is a romantic comedy that resembles the older movie Ghost in a way, but gives it a 2008 attitude. Very good movie!"
2,Not Funny,"OK, so I probably have little company but I didn't find ""Ghost Town"" funny. I thought I gave it my best should but on not one occasion did I laugh. Not even a wry grin! Perhaps I'm just a Grinch?People seem to be raving about Ricky Gervais. Yes, in ""The Office"", he's excellent. But, ""The Office"" is black comedy. ""Ghost Town"" is simply not comedy. It's little more than the usual Hollywood formula. Everything's predictable and the supposedly funny bits are contrived and weak.Life's short. Don't waste your time with this rubbish.PS Send hate mail if you wish."
2,Another stupid Hollywood movie... but with a funny british dude,"Two stars just because Gervais was there and he's awesome. Other than that, the movie was just the typical American Hollywood movie with happy ending and all that. If you you like that kind of movie, this is for you. If you hate happy endings (like me) this is just not for you."
2,schmaltzy romance that doesn't work,"Ricky Gervais and Tea Leoni make do with the poor story line, but just can deliver a convincing romance here. There is absolutely NO chemistry between the two of them. The ending is totally unbelievable and vapid."
3,"Not ""2.35:1""","This disc is presented in full 16x9 (1.77:1), NOT 2.35:1 as listed by Amazon. The box does not list a screen ratio."
2,ghost town,"i like dr. pinkus..he has the typical british dry, wry sense of humor.The role of Tea was not one that really showed her talents as an actor. In fact, other than the Pinkus role, the other characters do not appear to be fully developed. The story line was appealing. The movie had a light, feel good nature to it inspite of dead people lacking closure. Dead people lacking closure how unrealistic is that? In the end, the movie left me questioning whether i liked it or not. Perhaps the movie left me in the state of the undead with no closure....."
4,Great movie!,"Movie came in great condition! The only complaint I would have is that it did not come with the digital copy, it came with a digital copy of a different movie with a similar title. I ordered Ghost Town and received Ghosts of Girlfriends Past (that movie with Jennifer Garner and Matthew Mchonogueh?). I mean I can't really complain because I received my movie and then got the digital copy of a different movie, totaling two movies. But I thought it should be noted."
3,ghost town,"Basic plot. Guy doesn't like people and enjoys the quiet (sounds like someone i know). Then he dies and comes back to life but can speak to ghost who annoy him and need his help. He falls for the wife of the main ghost and changes. Its the same idea but with different elements. It's still good and funny but nothing new. Good people and acting though, say yay for that."
2,"Snoozer, With NO Laughs!",This movie was listed as a comedy. I kept waiting....but nothing was funny. The movie was boring. The story line was dull. I gave up 2/3 of the way in. What a waste of time.
2,This is okayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy,The songs wre okay but the song that I did not like the most was Ride the lighting. It didnot even sound close to the origanal.
3,It's fine for a large dog.,"It's rather a substantial piece of equipment. I bought it for a puppy, and it would really be overkill for her. If you have a large dog you can't control, this is for you."
5,convenient leash,"This is a great leash as it gets longer if you need it, it has a pocket for change and/or keys and you can put it in the seatbelt if need be when on the road. My dog isn't crazy about that feature but it's there if need be. The only thing was that the mesh on the inside of the pocket tore a bit on me after two uses. I would recommend this leash as it's sturdy and convenient."
4,Always a pleasure to listen to,"Whether he dedicates the songs to Elvis or sings his own songs inhis own style, Ronnie's music is always a pleasure to listen to. Onthis CD, backed up by the original Drifters (founded in 1953 byBill Pinkey, Clyde Mc Phatter & G.A. Trasher), Ronnie sings morelatin, carribean, summer and beach flavoured songs together with some ofthe good old Rock & Roll and Doo-Wop classics. You can feel that heloves singing all styles of genuine American music which makes thatalmost all of his CD's are worth the purchase."
5,Helps increas a little air flow if you are mildly overclocking.,"It worked, what can I say. I guess I can mention that I have two blue dual 12 inch cold cathode lamps in one of my towers and this just looks beautiful through the see through panel with all the lights lit."
5,This album charms me every.single.time,"I have owned this album for years but every time I pop it in it charms me all over again. I will never forget hearing them sing ""Back to the Cradle"" live and thinking, ""This is it."" It's a wonderful record."
2,Overblown,"The Sheila Divine certainly struck gold with their outstanding debut New Parade, an album with excellent, moody songwriting and dynamic range. Unfortunately, it seems like too many people felt it was their duty to praise lead singer Aaron Perrino on how incredible his voice was. Now instead of a passionate outing with yearning vocals and keen songcraft, we have an overblown series of vocal acrobatics that sound as if they were intended to get said frontman a tryout for the Phantom of the Opera. This album just limps along wounded, coming off flat and contrived and frankly I just didn't get it. An unfortunate mis-step for a once promising band."
3,Hip Hop Ambient Denizen,"This album attempts to bring together music from diverse parts of the planet and make it all(or most of it) sound like hip hop. There are some good moments when the American music influence doesn't overshadow what's there in its musical essence waiting to be heard. Subo's remix is great, especially the Brasilian percussion. Thievery Corp's take on B. Maal is also trippy and well done. But for the most part, I would rather hear and dance to the real deal. It seems that people think that to get listeners to listen to and buy African, Brasilian music one must put it in a hip-hop-ambient envelope for them to digest it. Not for me and many other dedicated dj's and dancers. If I want to hear African music, I'll take Paulo Flores from Angola any day of the week. If I want to hear Brasilian music, give me Olodum or Ara Ketu. The source is always richer than the subsequent rendtions. Remix at the source."
3,Good world comp,"At first I really liked this album. Very chill beats and learned some new people. Great dinner music or working backround stuff. Can get somewhat boring. However, some tracks are amazing. The beginning is where the most interesting stuff is and then fades into where I thinking I am at Bed, Bath, and Beyond. Like it overall."
2,Over Priced,Monster makes quality products but so do a lot of other companies. Why would you want to pay three to five times as much? You will not see any difference or hear any difference. Shop smart.
1,Product size shorter than original,"although the vendor reports that the piece is fit to my car, it is almost 5 cm shorter than the original, which resulted in less space to engine maintenance. I'm pretty upset because I live in Brazil and now I can not return the product. Rubbish purchase."
2,hood strut for BMW 3 series,"Shorter than stock which means my hood doesn't open as far anymore, will be replacing soon because I can't stand how much this has limited visibility of the engine bay. Not recommended, makes checking oil and anything in rear of engine bay more work."
1,Warning!!!,These lift supports were much shorter than the original ones and thus do not lift the hood high enough; in other words THEY DO NOT FIT! Order Sachs SG302008. They are more expensive but they are the right length.
3,the could have included the clips that hold it in place,This hood support works fine but the replacement models I've got in the past had the clips that hold it in place included where this did not. It was very disappointing since they have been on the car long enough to wear out the shock the clip is also in bad shape. Otherwise it holds the hood up.
1,These are NOT an OEM replacement,"As with the other three reviewers of this product, I found that this ""replacement"" part is not an OEM equivalent. The overall length of the lift is approximately two inches shorter than the parts that came from BMW. When these are installed and the hood is ""up"", it sits about six inches lower than the original design. To make matters worse, the product description does not include the compressed and uncompressed length information so there is no way to compare what you are ordering against what you need until after you take delivery. If I had known the length it would have been obvious that these wouldn't do.As a weekend DIY mechanic who repairs his own vehicles (3 cars, a truck, 2 boats and lots of yard equipment), there is no way would I ever recommend this product.Amazon was great about taking them back (best online retailer in the world, bar none)."
2,What a disappointment,"After reading the reviews and waiting until the last day before my trip to Galapagos to get these shoes, I was hoping they would be perfect for wet landings followed by casual hikes. Unfortunately, I got a blister on my instep the first time I wore them, thanks to a rough insole that is raised up. Not only could I not wear the shoes after that, I was uncomfortable in any shoes for a week. What a waste!"
5,Great shoe; even better price!!,"Bought them for my wife, and they have quickly become one of her favorite shoes!!"
4,Very Nice Shoes,"I bought these because I was going Whitewater rafting and wanted a sturdy watershoe. These make the grade. They have a very sturdy rubber bottom much like a sneaker. They are very nice looking and comfortable. I have trouble with cheap, flimsy watershoes. They will hurt my feet after a while of walking. These shoes do not. They have decent support. The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars is that they run big. I wear a womens size 7 and that's what I bought. These are a little loose on me and I feel like I should have gotten a 1/2 size smaller. But I needed them, so I kept them and deal with them being a little loose fitting. It's not a real big deal."
3,Ok,"The Item arrived in good time and was as stated.However, many of the book's pages were stuck together and ripped when attempting to seperate them.This made me very unhappy with the purchase.I have not complained directly to the seller, however, I believe a quality control procedure should have taken place before the item was posted.For me to complain, send the item back and receive another copy all seemed just to hard.Rob"
1,I never received this product I ordered.,"Even though I paid for this product as well as for the shipping, I never received this book from the seller. I would not suggest ordering anything from Amazon until you check it out completely."
2,Item broke within first week,"After having the toolbox for 1 week, I opened one side and the back hinge popped off. They just use self tapping screw to attach the hinge to the box. I ended up replacing the self tapping screws with nuts and bolts. Pretty flimsy!"
2,china junk,"this could have been bought @ harbor freight. i was fooled by the picture, don't make the same mistake."
2,Not brilliant,"Sorry, I simply couldn't listen to Studer as Gilda. I got an impression that she had to struggle with each high note, using a lot of force. In my opinion, Caro nome aria was a disaster - instead of a light flow of voice and gentle coloraturas there was a succession of cries, as if sung in a great deal pain.Apart from that, I enjoyed the recording."
4,"Good version, but it isn't the best.","This is a good version of 'Rigoleto', but I think that there are lots of versions better than this. Vladimir Chernov is the sourprise of the recording: he offers a really good Rigoletto, with a beautiful voice and a good psicologyc perfomance. Cheryl Studer as Gilda has a dramatical and beautiful voice, but she has also a very bad vibratto here. She's the worst singers of the version. Luciano Pavarotti knows the role of ""Ducca"" perfect, and he is an autentic classic singin it. Very very well all the little roles, specially Denyce Graves and Roberto Scandiuzzi as Maddalena and Sparafucile. The cast is full of famous names, as Ilberando D' Arcangelo, Dwayne Croft, Paul Groves, Heidi Grant Murphy... The orchestra and chorus of the MET directed by James Levine are simply well. But I think that they can do it better."
2,Poor Gilda,"This recording was made in ... 1993 ! Why hasn4t it been released earlier ? The answer: Cheryl Studer has enormous problems with the intonations in her aria. What happened to this once so brilliant ""Queen of the night"" ? This shouldn4t have been publishes on CD. In the duets with Rigoletto, mostly, her intonation is acceptable, but not in the duet with the duke. Since Cheryl Studer is disappointing and disqualifies herself, unfortunately, this recording suffers. Her credible interpretation does not help anymore. Fortunately, Vladimir Chernov somewhat compensates the disaster. He has the real voice of a Verdi baritone, his interpretation is equilibrated, but he is still far from Warren4s brilliance and thrill or Taddei4s intelligent interpretation. Levine, as usual, gives a vivid interpretation; sometimes the orchestra sounds too shrill."
4,informative,"This book is very informative. It gives the background of one of the world's most infamous men. It is not biased in any way. Instead, it gives a clear history of Hitler's life. Readers might be surprised to find out about the many accomplishments of this much-hated man. It made me think about how Adolf Hitler could have contributed to society, instead of hurting so many people. Things could have been VERY different...It is so sad to realize he wasted his talents and destroyed many lives because of hate."
2,Fast Eddie's Review,"This would be a good book as an intro to Hitler for a 10-12 year old. As an adult, the book read almost like ""See Jane run, run Jane run"" kind of simple language. I was just disappointed by this elementary level of writing."
2,meh,"This is a vague, basic overview that should not be considered by anyone who is searching for insight or more than general recall."
5,Venetian Obsession!,"I have done it....I have read every book written by Donna Leon. Her Brunetti mysteries set in Venice were like taking a tour of Venice, its politics, its social life, its artistic life and history. I cannot afford to travel to Venice so this is second best to that...to read all of this wonderful writer's books. I have found that there are highly skilled writers now writing in the mystery genre...and Donna Leon is a leader of the pack! Read any of them and you will fall in love...maybe not to the extent of my Venetian Obsession but you certainly will want more!"
2,What Other Monsters?,"For me, this encyclopedia has a misleading title in that most of the entries deal with vampires or vampire-like creatures. There is some material on werewolves & other shapeshifters and skinwalkers, but I found myself wondering where those 'Other Monsters' were. The author dedicated several pages to the 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' television series and the author Anne Rice while only giving a nod to classics such as 'Carmilla' and not even a mention of the 'Creature from the Black Lagoon' - and the only mention of Dr. Frankenstein or his monster is an entry for 'Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman'. There are also entries for Dion Fortune and Aleister Crowley - people who may have been involved in the occult but who were hardly monsters. Noticeably absent, especially in the presence of vampire and monster -portraying actors, is Vincent Price. Overall, I can only recommend this book in good conscience if you're a vampire fan. Otherwise, it will only disappoint."
3,"Not dissapointed, but not thrilled either.","The book has a smaller section on werewolves that I would have hoped. Its pretty straight forward with little skims of information, I find it helpful as a writer but for someone who just wants a book with better general information there is more out there."
4,"great fun,as usual, for all us Oxford vs Lewis fanciers","like the clever allusions...and always wonderful characters and acting...why they need eleven more words is a muystery to me...mystery fans, watch this..."
5,Lewis and Hathaway are the BEST!!!,"I have watched every one of the episodes in all seasons!These are a ""MUST SEE"" for everyone,I am ready for more!!!"
1,"Love The Series, Not The Price Of Four Episodes","I love the series, but I don't love the price of almost $38 (dvd + S&H) for only 4 episodes. That comes to $9.50 per episode or $19 per dvd which is only 2 episodes. Especially as PBS has been showing this 5th series on TV the last 3 weeks, so now the only episode I haven't already seen is the last one The Indelible Stain. Seriously, the price of 4 episodes should only be $20 at the most and I think when the next series comes out I'll just wait to watch them on PBS for free, since they're always aired around the same time the new dvd comes out."
5,Lewis is better with every season,"We enjoy all the English mysteries, and Inspector Lewis is one of the best. The story lines are somewhat complicated, but are tied together well in the end. We especially like the working relationship, between Lewis and Hathaway. This season, has proven to be our favorite so far. Hoping for more seasons to come. I would recommend this to anyone who likes an interesting, engrossing story line, with a little humour, and lots of pretty scenery."
5,Lewis and Hathaway score again.,"Between the great, well written stories and the excellent acting these are always some of our favorites. Buy this DVD you will not be disappointed!"
5,An exceptional series!,"This has to be one of my all time favorites. It is well written and acted, and so beautifully filmed and scored. I hope that the series will stay in production, as it is hard to find another series that measures up to the excellence of Lewis."
5,Inspecter Lewis brings a new spin to crimestopping.,"""Inspecter Lewis,"" brings a whole new spin to crimestopping that adds a flair of Oxford intelligence to the process of catching the criminals. I was enthralled by the way the pieces of clues are slowly given to the audience and leaves you hanging as each piece of the mystery unfolds. You must stay for the very end when you might be right or wrong as the rest unfolds. A modern version of Sherlock with his trusty side-kick. It brings an intelligent edge of your seat feel to the story-line. Hang on for an interesting ride."
5,"Magnificent production values, acting and cinematography","The best British programs always leave me wondering where all the great acting talent comes from. It seems more like living than performing. ""Lewis"" is one of the finest examples. I find myself thinking of the characters as real. Beyond the craft, lies excellent writing, splendid camerawork, and challenging, satisfying tales.Can't wait for Series 6..."
5,Grand British Entertainment,"I enjoyed ""Inspector Morse,"" and 'Lewis' is a great followup. An inside view of Oxford University and the countryside is included as a bonus."
5,great british mystery,Good character development and plot.The review guidelines are inflexible and irritating.The review guidelines are inflexible and irritating.The review guidelines are inflexible and irritating.T he review guidelines are inflexible and irritating.
4,Great Series!,Have always enjoyed this series. Can't understand why the rental cost have gone up sooooo much for this and other masterpiece series????
5,I love the series.,To make it short. The plot is good. The acting is good and I just love the background - Oxford is beautiful. It worth the money.
5,Great British TV,"Inspector Lewis continues the line of great British TV detectives. Get the whole series and start at the beginning. Great stories, acting and scenery."
5,Inspector Lewis #5,"I have been following Lewis since he was with Insporter Mooer, and I love this series of Murder Mysters. I wish there were more then four in the series but that ok to. If you like english mysters you love this series and the rest of them."
4,Lewis is top British drama.,"Lewis: great set, music, acting, and script. Fantastic home entertainment. Lewis makes hd shine and tv worth the time and few dollars."
5,Just the Best,Please purchase all the DVDs. Very well done. Has captions so Englis accents do not matter. Witty and a lot of fun.
5,Carries the torch onward,"With the departure of John Thaw as ""Morse"" , Inspector Lewis carries onwith the same flavor and style. The dialogue exchange with Lewis andHathaway is perhaps even wittier than between Morse and Lewis.If you enjoyed Morse ( and who didn't?) this series is definitelyworthy of it's predecessor."
3,toy things,i've got a 1985 toyota corolla 1296 cc 5 door can you help me with the thoery manual books best for this car
1,Just to forewarn you,No where on this ad does it mention that you need Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004. This is an expansion pack. Not a stand alone game.
5,Childhood favorite.,I wish I had this tape. Too bad my old one wore out. If I had known amazon.com existed I would have begged dad to get it again.
5,The Closest Thing To Perfection Achieved By Modern Animation,"Loved it. A deep and profound allegorical tale in which a woman and her two daughters (they are called ""witches for the sake of children) unleash a purple goo called ""the Smooze"" to cover the Dream Valley, and thereby rain on the parade of the Little Ponies. The Smooze is perhaps intended to represent the self-deprecating attitude of women toward other women, and toward themselves, covering the Dream Valley that is the idyllic childhood experienced before womanhood, and before they are inaugurated into a patriarchy that will indoctrinate them with these ideas that are, essentially, misogynistic. Watching this film, the audience gives rise to the hope that the Feminist movement will prevail over the misogynistic patriarchy (SPOILER:) just as the Little Ponies prevail over ""the Smooze""."
1,Very disappointed,"I was so upset to see this is movie was not made by the My Little Pony brand. The story was scary and the ponies were in less than half the movie. The ponies had different names some not appropriate. Not for young children who love the kind, pleasant and perky ponies we see with the product line."
5,My favorite pony is Liketysplit!!,"I will always cherish the my little pony forever in my heart, cuz everytime it brings me back to my childhood all the time. I was only 1 yrs old when this movie first came out, that i always used to watch it all the time when i was a kid, along with the care bears too. My favorite part is when the 2 witches were having a hard time trying to get the flim cuz i thought that was really funny. My favorite pony is Liketysplit, cuz she's just so cute & i love her voice and everything. The pony movie rocks!!!! I know when i have children someday, i'm definitely gonna show this movie to them. I hope they will like it as much as i did, when i was little. I think anybody will like this movie."
5,It was cute!,Not as good as the care bears movie but good enough. I thought this was so funny! The songs were good too. Nothing can stop the smooze! LOL
3,My Little Pony the Movie,this was an ok movie. i love my little pony but this one really didnt do justice. i liked some of the comedy and the songs. but i wish that some of the ponies in Escape from Midnight castle were in it.
1,Would've been nice to have been able to watch it....,"I bought this as a for me and my friend, because we watched this movie a lot when we were kids. But she lives out of town, and I didn't want to watch it without her. So I let the dvd sit, unopened until she finally was able to visit, approximately two months later. However, when I did open the case, half of the dvd was cracked in half, turning the donut shape of it into more of a ""c"" shape. Obviously, I can't watch it because it's cracked, it's impossible. And now I can't even return it. This is the one and only purchase from amazon that I regret. And I REALLY regret it.... Don't think it's possible for me to be any more of an unsatisfied customer. The End."
5,i love this movie,yes i love this movie so much it is great and all and i wish it was on dvd it said it is but no well that all thanks
1,"Totally stupid, but priceless in nostalgia value.","I took just as much pleasure watching this movie as an adult as I did when I was a kid, but went away realizing that kids will watch anything.I mean _anything_.The animation quality is abysmal, the songs are painfully stupid and the entire film is a plug for the latest Hasbro merchandise. (Dream Castle is destroyed by Shmooze? And the ponies have to move into Paradise Estate? Which just so happens to be on the shelves of your local toy store at this very minute? Along with those cute baby ponies that were introduced in the film?) Ultimately though, those details weren't enough to stop me watching the movie through and basking in warm childhood memories of My Little Pony. And in fairness to My Little Pony: The Movie, consumers cannot reasonably expect that any current or latter-day movie or TV series based on a toy--a toy, for God's sakes--will be anything more than an extended advertisement compliments of the toy manufacturer."
1,Terrible movie not recommended for any age,"I bought this movie for my 4 1/2 year old who loves My Little Ponies thinking it would be as sweet and innocent as the brand. It was scary, violent, and said things like ""shut up"" which is something I discourage my child from saying. The evil witches were the main characters of the show and the smooze/goo/whatever it was is really scary for my 4 1/2 year old. Even the ponies were whiny and disagreeable and not very loveable.I turned it off after 45 minutes and refuse to let my children watch it again. It's going in the garbage as I wouldn't want anyone else to watch it either."
4,Nostalgia and some fun...,"I would say that this movie is much more enjoyable either if you are under the age of 10 or if you used to watch it as a child. I am in the latter category and I hadn't seen the movie in probably 10+ years. I watched it and still enjoyed it, though I can say that there are flaws to the movie. It is silly at times and has some weird elements (the Smooze is pretty weird) but I would say that overall, it's still a fun movie to watch. Like most of the cartoons from that era, it tries to teach a lesson, and for that reason I think it is worthwhile to share with a child or to watch if you used to love it.This movie also has a star-studded cast, including Danny DeVito, Madeline Kahn (who I love), and many others that you may recognize by their voices. All these stars for a pretty cheap price is a bargain to me. If you don't read into the movie too much, it's a very cute and fun flick."
5,Superb,"After watching the End of Flutter Valley, my friend's daugher wanted more, so for her birthday I bought her this movie and now she calls her cat Mr. Moochik. It's a great movie, again with song and dance, ethics and morals, the importance of working together and compromise. It's not only a great movie, but a great teaching tool."
4,very entertaining dvd,I bought this DVD for my grandaugher who is 3yrs old. She really likes the DVD and requests it often.
4,An overlooked gem,"This is one of my favorite animated movies of all time. I recently rented it from blockbuster (I wish they had some of the other little pony movies) and fell in love with it again. The smooze is attacking, something sent by the witches, and meanwhile baby lickity split has run away. Alas, I had to give this a 4 instead of 5 because The freaky ""cute"" children make me want to .... Great voice talents by Madeline kahn, Cloris Leachman, and Danny DeVito."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!,"I bought this thinking I was getting Resuce from Midnight Castle but all I got was that Smooze's movie or whatever those purple blobs are called! I trusted what the reviewers were saying about the tape! BIG MISTAKE!! I don't know if the reviewers got luckly with their tapes or their trying to help sales by lying either way I'm angery!! I wanted Midnight Castle the full version!!! I hated how the Pony dvd set only had the edited version! If anyone has Midnight Castle for sale, please make it VERY clear what it is!!! I wish that it'd come out on dvd with the full verison!! I loved that movie and still do which is why I'm so angery. I wanted my childern to see the full verison! Thanks for nothing other reviewers, you let me get tricked and heartbroken!!!"
4,HUH?? !! Could the price of this video be a typo??,"Wow ! I was very surprised at the hefty cost of this video (Sticker shock, anyone??). I do believe that it's still available from the original publisher of the book ""The Montauk Project"" which is, I believe ""Skybooks"" ??? You'd have to check - caveat emptor - It's certainly a fraction of the cost of this list price from the original publisher, as I recall. I was very taken aback that someone would offer this still-in-print edition of this video for such a hefty price (it's not like it's a first-edition/signed Hemingway or Twain or anything like that. ) Go figure......"
3,The Art of Gaman,"This book was very interesting, but limited. It did not go deep enough in identifying all of the internment camps. A reason could be that there is just too little known about the ranges of art produced at the various camps. I bought this book as I have a large and extremely well-done painting that was made by a Japanese artist during internment in Arizona. So I thought this could aid me in locating and identifying the artist. Paintings were not featured in this book. The book is charming and at least, is a beginning."
5,I was moved to tears,The heart and spirit of the japanese internees continued to shine within the walls of their confinement. They found beauty and admiration of beautiful things living in desolate and inhumane conditions of the prison camps. This is a understated book with touching stories to tell.
2,Flimsy and Disgusting,"The first volume of ""Selfish Love,"" while still kind of repetitive and poorly characterized, wasn't as bad as the second one. In this volume, thankfully the last one in the series, the main characters continue to fight outwardly while inwardly ""loving"" each other. The lowest point in the already low plot is when Orita (""the bigger one"") rapes Ryuya (""the smaller one"") because, of course, Ryuya ""really wanted it."" Other than that, the story is boring, nothing really happens except that the characters are ""in love"" and some something or other having to do with school kind of barely figures in. Basically, this title made me sick."
4,ah the ending,"This concluding volume is not bad at all but I wished there was more resistance in the end to make the you know what more special, otherwise the story /plot developed nicely."
5,Amazing Screws,"Most people probably don't pay attention to screws, but I took a chance and purchased this set at my local hardware store. Once I had used them on a number of projects, I could never go back. They are made of good quality metal, so I cam out much less than with the regular screws you find that are made in China of scrap metal (or whatever). The larger screws also have a slight serration along their edge that makes them go into wood like a knife into butter. Highly recommended."
3,No information,None of these kits has any indication of what sizes are in the kit or how many of each.SPAX screws use a combo drive which is a square drive with a Philips. They require either a square drive bit or a combo bit from some specialty outfit like Mcfeeley's.That being said the above reviewer was faked out by two things. First in most materials the no pilot hole is wishful thinking; second the screws have a special serrated edge and finish which looks poor but provides superior holding power.Excellent screw. The kit could be a good deal but SPAX doesn't admit to having any of the 3 kits here on Amazon and no one else does either. With the information provided I am not buying a pig in a poke.
2,Disappointed,"I tried the screws from this kit to fasten a long 3/4"" birch plywood corner. It appeared that they should be ideal for driving through a panel into end grain, and without pilot holes. But to me,their appearance is that of very inexpensive parts, with a coarse and not well-finished surface. I found that they cammed out easily, and took a lot of force to sink and secure the joint. I did the other side with pilot holes and traditional deck screws (beautifully smooth finish, as usual) (could use square-drive bits,no cam-out)and was perfectly satisfied. It may be just me, but I won't use them again. Very disappointing."
2,New history?,"After stating on page 11, that Ben Franklin worked for British intelligence during the Revolutionary War the rest of this author's work is discredited."
4,Good information,I was required to read this for work. I found the information very concrete and there were good examples. It is a very fast read which was good. The only negative thing is that I wished it was available on the kindle :) I am trying not to buy hard copy anymore.
2,not a quality reference on the topic,"The only thing good about this book is that at one time it was the only book available on reverse mortgages. That is no longer the case. While I haven't sampled the other titles to say how they compare, I can say that you'll find better quality information freely available on the net.Among the flaws of this book:It dedicates about 3 chapters (see the table of contents) to discussing what you can do with your money after you've obtained a reverse mortgage. As there are no real restrictions on how that money can be spent, these are useless, arbitrary chapters that would be far better covered in a book on how to spend your retirement.The few interesting facts the book does introduce (such as the possibility of reducing fees if the mortgage proceeds are applied to long-term care insurance) are not backed up with references, or - as it turns out - explained as being proposed legislation that may never become reality."
5,Excellent Mix,"This album takes the listener through a wide band of music from the wild to mild. The soundtrack blended well with the production. I recommend the film and owning the soundtrack is a must. Jackie the Jokeman's Marijuana song is great and Jo-Ann Barton's ""No One Cares"" is a bit creepy but fits the mood. Five Stars to the movie and 5 to the music. Money well spent."
3,"The Hip Hop is good, the Instrumentals not so much","If there's one thing the Sharpshooters can do, it's bust a laid back hip-hop groove and get a dope MC to lay down lyrics over it. That's what got me to purchase this CD. The song ""Analyze"" was featured on DJ Spooky's ""Modern Mantra"" and I loved it. The other hip hop tracks on the album are all pretty tight, although I'd say Analyze still is my out and out favorite. The instrumentals however, are where the Sharpshooters are not as good. They're not horrible mind you, I can still easily listen to the CD all the way through, but they're not terribly interesting nor do they demonstrate any extraordinary talent. So basically, if you're looking for a few (4-5) good hip hop tracks and several decent acid jazz tracks, go for this CD."
5,OFFERS READER MORE THAN TODAY'S BEST-SELLERS,"What a fantastic novel. And this is only Nilan's first? The writing is outstanding, with marvelous attention to structure, language, and detail. These elements are so often sadly lacking in today's novels. This espionage tale is fascinating on so many different levels. Yes, the foreign setting, involving intrigue interlinked with romance, is reminiscent of many best-sellers. However, this novel offers the reader so very much more! Nilan has used her talents beautifully in the creation of larger-than-life characters with an eye for delicate detail, while rounding out the undercurrent of relationships, preserving the whole, and leading us to the sursprising, satisfactory ending."
3,Love in the Cold War,"Put this novel in the romantic suspense catagory. In 1983 Leigh McCormack takes a Caribbean cruise and meets a handsome member of the ship's crew. Being a non-conformist, she refuses to take the tours arranged by the cruise line but goes off on her own at the various ports-of-call, getting herself into some interesting scrapes including some which make her believe that there is more going on than just an ordinary cruise. This is during the Cold War and the Reagan administration.Fast forward to the present. The lovers meet again under strange circumstances. And the rest, as is said, is history."
4,A Rare Combination of talent!,"Lisa Addeo has created a superb work with her Hotel California CD. Listen and experience passion and sensual delights. This contribution has a cutting edge while always maintaining a soothing hypnotic quality. This new offering exposes a rare combination of talent as an arranger, musician and vocalist. This is worth buying!"
4,Arturo's the man,"Let's face it, Arturo's just the man. He's a diverse player who truly appreciates music. This CD is a live recording of Arturo flexing his muscles. I highly recommend it. It has him playing in different styles and although it may not be quite as pollished as his non-live albums, it's obviouse that he loves playing for an audience. If you're an Arturo fan, this is a ""must buy"" item."
4,wake up...WAKE UP!!!,"...Back to the album, this a true Evo/Revo-lution of jazz and downtempo beats but a truly sincere comp. Not one where there is about 1/3 you really like, 1/3 is ok, and the rest just aren't complete, more or less fillers to support the title. I would compare this to where David Holmes left off with the Out of Sight soundtrack,what OM toched on but lost and what Shadow has always provided but in their freshed years of production. A sexy, lonely, emotional, and inner-conclusion inducing album allowing you to base your thoughts as the lyrics and forget about life for awile."
1,Awful,"These sticks are not the proper thickness and are too rough, they do not fall properly and we cannot play the game like this. I will have to return them."
4,nice quality,"this is a childhood game that i remembered playing with cheap plastic sticks in a paper tube... i wanted to get this to play with friends, and it is terrific quality item. i dont like the design of the box as much as i thought it would be kind of vintage-y, it is okay with the exception of the slideout top which looks kind of like it was written in chalk. i like the muted tones of the sticks and they feel nice and solid in your hands.overall i would recommend this, i buy many melissa and doug products and love them!"
3,the sticks are a bit too thick and rough,"The Amazon description says that these are exceptional quality and value which I don't think it is the case. When I was a kid, I played with sticks that had much smoother surface and they were thinner. Also, they break easily in the kids' hands."
2,thick,"i like the melissa & doug line... the quality is really legit.i don't personally love their color scheme, but whatev. it's just colored sticks.the thing is, these suckers are FAT sticks! it makes playing the game really hard! not like those spaghetti-thin colored plastic ones i used when i was a kid... (you know the ones that kinda bend too?)just thought you should know"
5,More Power,Length:: 0:07 MinsThis air filter is fantastic it adds power makes better throttle response and more acceleration I recommend this to any one with a Suzuki DRZ-125
5,Great product!,I used these to make multi-socket cords for my Christmas village. I was able to put just the amount at just the right distances for my own custom set-up. Very easy to install--all it took was a decent set of pliers. I would definitely recommend.
3,very nice,"I think this is a nice piece of jewelry from pirates. It's nothing big obviously so don't be disappointed if it's not what you thought it was, but if you're a collector of pirate stuff, I recommend it, especially if you have kids, but be careful not to give it to real young ones, cause if the necklace were to break or something, they could choke on the beads, but it's nice!"
3,Tia Dalma Necklace Review,"This purchase was for a Halloween costume and as such the item has not been used fully yet, though I expect it to be durable and everything as required. It was not purchased as a toy, so the standardized review stars are of limited use."
5,"Great ""jewel""","It's a nice piece, unfortunately, is not an actual cameo, so it does not open and you can not put a photo. However, I do not want it to be functional, but to keep it in my personal treasure. Thank you."
3,It's Ok,"I bought this item to use as a prop. You may want to replace the chain for something more dureable, depending on what you are using it for. The amulet is not a solid piece. It is hollow in the back and easy to bend, so be careful. Overall, for a prop, it is worth what I paid for it."
4,good and proper,"Like all of Briton's Proper labels 4 cd box sets this offers a helluva lot of music for a terrific price! And, as always, it's music recorded in the 40's and sound quality ranges all the way from murky to acceptable and some good. But, if you are a fan of Latin Jazz, or a Machito worshipper [how can ya love Latin Jazz and not worship Machito? He was the best!], you will want this box set. Just for historical reasons, it offers pretty much a conclusive assembally, and on the nightclub recordings from BirdLand in New York, the searing heat and powerful jazz makes it through even though the one mike recordings from the radio are frustrating."
5,The MAN can COOK ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !,"Insightful without being fussy or new age. The man obviously knows the culture and history behind this regional cooking. The attention to rice, sauces, and other basics is helpful and a terrific refresher course.The buttermilk biscuit receipe is foolproof and an absolute winner. If a cook can present a receipe this well, he has my attention and appreciation.What is next, Marvin????greg leaf glorieta, new mexico"
5,Southern cooking with a real flair,"This is one of my favorite cookbooks, especially after spending a summer in Charleston last year. I was raised on very traditional southern cooking, and I was looking for something that added a bit of gourmet flair to traditional recipes (and made them a bit healthier). This cookbook does it beautifully, and has a lot of nice background on low country cooking, food traditions, and history. The collard greens and gumbo recipes are just spectacular. I like too that there are basic recipes for things like hoppin john and plain old rice. No pretty pictures, but the volume of recipes more than makes up for it.If you are looking for something reminiscent of your grandma's cooking in the fifties, with lots of fatback and crisco, you won't find it here. But I think this is a much tastier, healthier turn on my favorite little bit of southern food."
2,Dissapointing Cook Book,"I bought this book for a present. As a past resident of the Low-Country, I had high expectations for the recipes and pictures in this cookbook. It didn't hardy have any pictures, which I think is a major shortcoming of any cookbook. Also, the recipe titles and presentations were dull. I ended up keeping the cookbook because I didn't think it was present-worthy."
5,"I am a reader in Orange Park, Fl. Augusst 1, 2000",This is an excellent cookbook. The recipes are easy to read and follow. The recipes are very appetizing. What a find
3,Nice but ....uninspired.,I was eaagerly awaiting the delivery of this book and was disappointed. The recipies were little more than re-hashing some basic carolina cooking. Nothing innovative or even interesting.I was hoping for more.
2,Not Authentic Soul Food,"I really disliked this coobook because it did not capture the real way people of the south cook. I am born and raised in the south and this is nothing like the food you get from big momma's house. There is absolutly nothing ""gourmet"" about true soul food. You use what you have to make a great meal. It is not about splurging on items that you would not normally have on hand. You use what you have to make a meal. Thanks for the effort though..."
1,Many better choices,"Of all the British Columbia travel guides, one of them has to be the least useful. In my opinion, this is the one. The credentials of the authors seem solid enough and coverage is broad (Alberta is also included), but beyond that there's little good to say. It's the shortest of the major guides, is of poor quality (the binding fell apart almost immediately on my copy), and the information is superficial and now very outdated. I guess I should have known better before buying by looking at the cover: the picture of Moraine Lake has been inverted, reflecting both back-to-front mountains and the lack of care that's gone into this book."
3,"Entertaining, some chinese lessons","Not as good as Little Pim , but does teach some mandarin to a almost two year old. My kid does find them entertaining."
4,A Coffee Marketing History,"Uncommon Grounds, by Mike Pendergrast, is a well-researched history on the marketing of coffee worldwide. Unfortunately, the amount of material devoted to teaching the reader about coffee per se is limited. Having said that, however, I did learn a modest amount of true coffee minutiae in between page after page of coffee capitalism. The book was first published in 1999 and based on that fact alone seems somewhat dated. I am sure there are better coffee books out there if one wishes to read about the various aspects of growing, roasting, and preparing coffee. Nevertheless, Uncommon Grounds succeeds marvelously as an insight into the 200 plus years of American coffee marketing. As an avid reader of history, I enjoyed the coverage concerning coffee politics and particularly that of the Central American coffee plantation growers and workers. Overall, an interesting read."
5,Pendergrast is coffee.,"Mark Pendergrast writes books, he writes them very well. I personally am a coffee nut, and Mark's book, ""Uncommon Grounds"" is Mark in his finest hour. He has presented the history in a story like fashion, an interesting dialog rather than a boring data like style. I feel like he is telling me all about his friend named coffee. His ability to dwell among the details is entertaining, not simply boring pages of data re-quoted from the internet that anyone could look up. This particular book, only one of many that I own on the subject of coffee, is, as I have found to be, the only book I need on the subject. It is complete in every detail, well written, entertaining, and worth twice the price I paid.Well done Mr. Pendergrast, I appreciate your art.Thanx,Byron Gates JrOwner/TheArtofCoffee.org"
3,Interesting book.,"Rarely does a book surprise me the way ""Uncommon Grounds"" did. Who would have thought that the history of coffee was so interesting or complex? Pendergrast does some through research and digs up endlessly fascinating tidbits. Did you know that coffee is originally from Ethiopia? The migration of coffee around the world and the business wars that raged over the sale of coffee to consumers in America is an oft-neglected subject in the annals of history. While the book is a real surprise, my only complaints are that Pendergrast tends to inject his leftist sympathies somewhat too often."
3,A bit tedious and more,"Although critically acclaimed, this book was not exactly what I was seeking. It gives the history of the US mass market coffee companies in excruciating detail, but as a coffee afficianado, I think I know more about coffee itself and how to prepare it well than does the author.If you are interested in the down and dirty history of Folgers, of Chock Full of Nuts, of Hills Brothers, than this is your book. If you are sincerely interested in fine coffee, and have attained a level of appreciation of same, this book will quickly become tedious.What I don't get is how the average Folgers or Hills Brothers or what have you drinker would be sufficiently interested in Coffee Per se (being as they drink plonk) to spend the time and money on this book. The real coffee drinkers out there, the people who go to effort to get or make great coffee, are going to find this tretise dull and unbearable after page 150 or so."
1,Doesn't deliver,"This book's title promises much more than it delivers -- it is mostly a mishmash of information on pricing and policies and just about nothing on how it ""transformed our world."""
1,Boring Merchandise Account Packaged Up as Cultural History,"A very weak and boring book all about the coffee trade. Don't be fooled: This book is NOT about the cultural history of coffee! It's been packaged that way to make it sell. To read about the cultural history of coffee, get The World of Caffeine: The Science and Culture of the World's Most Popular Drug.The World of Caffeine: The Science and Culture of the World's Most Popular Drug"
3,"Solid information, becoming a bit dated","Uncommon Grounds is still very useful in terms of understanding the history of coffee... but many references which discuss the immediate economic situation are, of course, becoming dated. A revision would be welcome."
4,I don't speak French and it don't matter,"Certainly a good value for the money with 2 CD's for just a smidge over the price of one. You'll get over 1 1/2 hour's worth of music (the songs are short). And if you're like me and not a francophone, you'll enjoy the music despite not being able to understand the lyrics.The music is very mood inspiring. I used to play this in my office at work and whenever people would walk in they'd comment on how it felt so relaxing and summerlike. Sure, it was summer when that happened, but I know the real reason was the music. It transported you to a time and place where it was a perpetual late summer (and most likely France).My favorite song - and this is a bit of a cop-out - is La Mer, also known as Beyond the Sea. This is the version that was out there before Bobby Darin covered it and, for me, it is the definitive version.Listen and enjoy."
5,Fun from Ft.Collins!,Great album from legendary Ft.Collins band. Won Lump Some was well known for their wild concerts but this album recorded in NYC and produced by Shimmy-Disc founder Kramer cemented their status in Colorado music history.
1,Deciphering e-mail headers,"I just paid $9.95 for an edoc that contains 867 words. It also contains 5 links to information on other sites. I tried them and only email.about.com takes you to a page with information. The others are dead links with no apparent way to find the information they are supposed to produce.I now discover that even after I have purchased a less than stellar paper with a majority of the links found to be dead, I am unable to obtain a refund per the Amazon policy. Selling defective products with no return policy is an unacceptable way to do business and certainly reduces the level of confidence in Amazon and the publisher. In addition, the reference to the Document on Amazon provides no Date of Publication so there is no way to know how dated the material is. In this case, it is from April 9, 2007 - rather outdated.Not a good investment of either time or money."
3,"Ok, but not what I expected.","With all the hype given in the reviews I guess I was expecting too much. It is a good book, but it wouldn't be my first choice if I was a novice and wanted to learn Tai Chi. I would recommend a video to those who want to learn and practice.DG Ft.Lauderdale"
1,Tai Chi Chuan. 24 & 48 Form,No instruction on this DVD.... Not the 48 form I was looking for..For me it was a wast of money.... very disapointing from this Grandmaster... his TV show is very good..Yang Style 48 form..without instuction it os just a movie.. Terry Dunn's Tape is Excerlant... just perfect for learning from.
4,I feel great,"I've definitely noticed a significant improvement in my overall flexibility, and that's from the stretching alone. I haven't been able to practice the actual tai chi postures because it's difficult to learn them from a book alone. Still a good start nevertheless."
4,Well thought out,Found instruction to be thorough and easy to follow. Once posture is mastered it easy to practice just the posture witnout the instructions.
2,Difficult to follow,"It's a basic video of a man doing tai chi, which is exactly what I was looking for. But I like to do things right. Technique above all other. With this dvd you don't know if you are suppose to be mirror image, or if he moves his right arm say, you move your right arm (not left as oppose to mirror image). If not for that reason alone, I would give it 4 stars because it's good, but not great (at explaining things, and difficult to follow)."
2,Electronic layout makes learning difficult,"I purchased the Kindle edition to complement the DVD. It makes sense to have the written format as well as the video. The Kindle layout makes it very difficult to read the text and refer to the photographs. They are not necessarily together, and it is often confusing which text & photo go together, and to refer to the photo as you are reading. Even the picture captions are often displayed with the wrong picture (in a series of photos you often get the photo displayed with the caption from the preceding photo). I am very disappointed, and expect I will now buy the book."
4,Good Reference...,"This was a really good reference book, but the art of Tai Chi is something you really need personal instructions with in conjunction with this book. Don't think you can learn Tai Chi by using just this book or maybe it was me?"
4,A Connoisseur's Cannabis Compendium!,"This book has just about everything you'd ever want to know about marijuana, and it's written in a ""head-friendly"" prose style that makes it an excellent diversion whilst indulging. The graphics, many quite lurid, harken back to a simpler (read: stupider) time that is thankfully past. Congratulations to Santa Monica Press for having the balls to print this outstanding tome!"
5,An amazing collection of poetry,"This collection is a treasure among poetry, not only for its rich collection of voices and poignant social commentary on being Latin in America, but for its brutal honesty and courageous content that reveals both the beautiful and horrendous aspects of American culture as well as the Latin culture that these poets have left behind. All of the voices teach educational lessons to the readers, and bring an edge about the realities of living in America that can only be told accurately through the mouths of those experiencing it.This is an excellent read for all cultures who've found themselves in America, especially those who grow up in secluded suburban neighborhoods and have no concept or empathy for `the other'. I recommend this text to all readers, especially early teens since so few books of poetry are written for this age group.-Lindsey Miller, [...]"
5,Table of Contents,"Table of contents:1. Introduction -- 2. Maurice Dobb and the debate on the transition to capitalism -- 3. Rodney Hilton on feudalism and the English peasantry -- 4. Christopher Hill on the English revolution -- 5. Eric Hobsbawm on workers, peasants and world history -- 6. E.P. Thompson on the making of the English working class -- 7. The collective contribution."
5,I wanna go to the Madhouse,"These might possibly be the best chips ever.The bad news is that we can't keep them in the house. As soon as we bring in a case they disappear. The kids take them to school and keep them in their lockers or everyone just grabs a bag in the evening as a snack. They taste great. It's 6:00 in the morning right now and I can taste them as I write this...how quickly can Amazon get them here?The good news is that they are good for you (well as good as chips can be). Not that I know a lot about this stuff but I read that they use ""good"" oils to make the chips so there are no trans fats (or something like that).Man, I wish I had some right now."
5,AWESOME sweet BAR B Q chips with a very crispy hard crunch. Best BBQ chips out there.,"Awesome taste, Gluten free and low in fat. What more can you ask for? If you like the harder crunchy chips these are for you. Not too spicy just a sweet barbque chip. My boys and I love them."
1,I have only tried the BBQ flavor but...,"...they are not so good in my opinion. Described on the bag as light and crisp, they are anything but. These are thick chips made double thick by all the flavorings which is just so over-done, it is falling off into the bottom of the bag. You get about 6 actual chips with loads of orange flavor dust in the bottom of the bag, and it's not the kind that you can dump into your mouth at the end, it is sooooo salty. I bought these for vending (1 oz size) because the Kettle Brand BBQ (which IS good btw) has never come back in stock since I purchased them this past summer. The price is not bad on the madhouse chips but now I have way too many that I will not be able to sell very well (72 pack).I'll probably end up giving them away."
5,Happy snacker.,I've recently had to change my diet and cut down on salt. I'm a salt-aholic so this wasn't easy. I found Madhouse Munchies chips in a Gourmet Kitchen store and I was amazed at how good they taste. They have about half the sodium of other chips but taste delicious and satisfy the salt craving. The store that carried these is far enough away that I don't get there often so I checked the internet. I'm able to get a case of 12 bags delivered right to my door for a reasonable price. Thanks Amazon.
4,Potato Chip Lover,I do like the sea salted chips but wish they were less salty. If they were I would have given them 5 stars.
3,Salt & Vinegar chips,These chips did have a terrific bite but still a bit on the greasy side but that's what Kettle chips are. My all time favorite is the Lays salt/vinegar but no longer in the stores where I reside and the company on amazon that sells them only has the 1.5oz (too small) and by the time you pay shipping...not worth it. Overall the Madhouse Munchies not bad and the 5oz size is quite lg. There was a promotional special when I ordered so got the case at a great price on Amazon.
4,4 stars - I liked it,"A great, short read. Interesting and engaging, even if it doesn't have a lot of depth. The characters could've had a bit more development, but this book has a likeable hero, a spunky heroine, and enough secrecy to satisfy. I don't know if this is still in print, I found a copy at the library."
2,"Early L & H talkie is awkward, but amusing in spots","This was one of Laurel & Hardy's first sound films, and it was also released as a silent. Unfortunately, the film falls somewhere between the two styles, so an upper-berth scene runs too long and goes nowhere. On the plus side, some of the train-station gags are very funny, and the added colorization is a pleasant novelty. Completists will want this, but it isn't Laurel & Hardy at their best."
2,great opening..then falls flat,"for an early talkie this production is quite smooth. the pacing,music,and effects are 1st rate. the story is too thin to sustain interest for 20 minutes.elements of previous laurel @hardy comidies are incorporated into this film but new material would have made this talkie more enjoyable."
1,"Awkward early-talkie experiment, but the added color helps","""Berth Marks"" is one of Laurel & Hardy's earliest sound films. The cast and crew had not yet perfected the talkie format, so the pacing is awkward and the ad-libbed dialogue is repetitive. The first few minutes are amusing, with Stan and Ollie hurriedly trying to board a train, but the rest of the film is slow and tentative, as the boys try to get settled in their berth. (The feature ""The Big Noise"" uses the same routine to better effect.) Below average for the team, but the colorization is excellent and adds some novelty value for L & H completists. Casual fans should try another L & H comedy first."
5,Sons sound better than ever!,"This brings back so many good memories that I almost started hyper-ventillating! I must have seen the Sons at least 15 times back in the seventies all around the San Francisco Bay Area. They even played at my ninth grade graduation...Wilbur jr. High, Palo Alto Cal., circa 1969. Live on Maui,and couldn't make shows, but this live album is fantastic!! Really love Geoff Palmer on the vibes, and Mic Gillete is a great addition. Little disappointed that a couple of tracks fade out, especially Misery when Terry Haggerty is starting to flame....But a 15 minute Freedom more than makes up for it. They have a lot of great tunes, dare we ask for a Vol.2?"
5,"Pure Bill Champlin, Not Bill ""Chicago"" Champlin","Don't buy this to hear Bill's variations on Chicago music. Do buy it if you like a fun'n funky but smooth rock style. Our favorite cut tho is unique to the rest: Time Will Bring You Love -- if you ever liked anything by James Taylor, you will go bonkers over this song and it's treatment. It deserves release as a single! It's a top 10 easy listening performance."
5,An Experience Worth Listening To!,"I got this Son's Live CD as soon as it came out. We went on down to the local record store and met the band (awesome guys!) and bought 5 copies. I proceeded to give them away to those folks who never heard of the Sons just to see what they would do.....well, I bet you know, they went nuts! All of these people love this music and got to see them ""live"" last Fall. They are ""Dedicated Fans"" now. This album is only the beginning of what should happen next....more CD's, more live shows! The Sons Live CD is a great way to get to know this band and exactly where they are coming from....... the heart and soul! Don't just sit there go get a copy now, kick back and enjoy the ultimate music experience. You will never be sorry you did!"
3,Sons of Nostalgia,Nostalgia is the key word here. This reunion CD is a good addition to anyone's collection. Buy now as this nostalgia band will disappear with the millennium.
5,Nobody like 'em!,"In a time when sameness rules, there's the Sons to tell us rock can be original and can go straight to your soul. Saw the Sons at Ludlow Garage (Cincinnati) in the late 60's. I'd give my right arm for them to come to the Midwest (Cleveland O-HI-O). Maybe I can talk the folks at the Rock Hall to bring them in.Their live CD? That's a no-brainer purchase if I ever saw one. You want jaw-dropping, awesome, the-way-it-should-be rock 'n roll?? Catch the Sons on CD, or live if you can. Nobody ... NOBODY like 'em."
3,"Not a bad piece for ""Harry Homeowner"".",This is great for very small twigs and weeds. It struggles on small shrubs like holly bushes. The cutting teeth are designed for smaller use and doesn't allow for limbs closer to or around 1/2 inch. Great if you stick to cutting No.2 pencil sized or smaller. I was displeased as my use required slightly bigger.
1,"Trash, do not buy",I have owned 2 of these and neither has lasted more the 1.5 years. Poor quality and design.
1,POS,This thing is a piece of junk. Ive had it for approx 1.5 years. Ive used it approx 10 times and it won't stay running or start for squat. I'm wondering if it is worth taking to a repair shop or springing for a new battery powered one.
2,Disappointing results,"I have been disappointed with this product because the trimmer does not clip all small branches and leaves a ""whiskered"" look. My previous Weed Eater trimmer was much better."
2,Too Flimsey,"I read the manual which said something to the effect that I should receive about 100 hours of use from this trimmer. Well, I didn't get quite that. After two years of use, the screws securing the blade to the body fell out, and the trimmer is now in the trash. The plastic threads in the body are stripped.I like the weight of the trimmer compared to a 14 lb commercial model. I'm buying an entry level Tanaka that weighs 9 lb, and costs $100 more than the unit that failed."
2,2nd Vote: Cheap construction & some design flaws,ALL Plastic design... Pull start disintegrated after 2 years of use... Wound up having to throw hundreds of dollars in the trash. I was also constantly hitting the choke and having to re-start. I'd rather buy something that's going to last rather than replace a plastic toy every 2 years.
4,Gas powered trimmers,This product is easy start it works well stainless steel blade I lube it with wd 40 while using the machine a Little lite in power for the price its a bargain it does get the job done and works very well
5,One of my favorites,"This album is charming, mellow and cool... Unquestionably one of my favorite albums. Everyone I have played this album for has eventually gone out and bought it. If you skip this one you're missing out..."
2,Too Many Weird Al Albums?,"Often compared to Nick Lowe and Jonathon Richman, Shelley is a bit more like the latter than the former. Quirky, witty and earnest, what Shelley really lacks is the hooks. Also his wit trends to the geeky (check out `That's Where The Plaque Is') I expected to be a fan based but sadly Too Many Movies just isn't an album I would listen too more than once or twice. Best track is `The Girl With The Light In Her Eyes'."
5,Wonderfull BUZZ doll,Arrived cuter than the photo. My 2 year old adores it and my 4 year old keeps steeling it from my 2 year old.
3,Cheap toy,cheap made( in china) eyes painted on. kid played with it for a day and then lost interest. would not buy again
4,strange shape,This wont fit the razr the most popular phone on the planet They also made it way thicker than it ever needs to be( if the razr did fit you could put 3 of them in it). The only cheap part on it is the small half moon that you would clip a cord on to to catch the case if it fell off your belt. That is made of plastic and broke the first day i put it on my belt. This case looks nice and is strong would fit a phone like the LG vx6100
5,One of the greatest jazz guitarists ever & a great singer,"Why fool around with a single disc sampler for $18.99 when for $24.99 you get everything from her early period on this box set. Sister Rosetta Tharpe was a Gospel singer who sounded more like a niteclub jazz singer, she sings more like Helen Humes then Mahalia Jackson. She plays guitar in a jazz style similar to Charie Christianson. This set will prove that Rosetta is the greatest Gospel singer of all time abd a underrated and forgotten jazz guitar legend, some of the best cuts feature her singin with just her guitar, man she swings!!! She is also featured with big bands, and she jums the blues!!!"
5,Mario Lanza rocks!,"I've always loved Mario Lanza's voice and selection of recordings. I grew up listening to Calvalcade of Show Tunes and just had to have the music. I couldn't find the songs on iTunes, Rhapsody or other sites and was just lucky to find on Amazon. The price was good, the vendor was quite prompt in product delivery."
2,Good for cheap horseshoe fix but lacking in quality,"After seeing that a pair of tournament shoes costs about $50-$60, I opted for this $40 set. I am not a horseshoe fanatic and was just looking to pick up a new hobby. A friend and I went to a local park to try our hand at shoe pitching the day I received the set. This park had horseshoe pits that consisted of dirt around the stake and concrete outside of the stake area. Within the first half hour one of the shoes hit the concrete area and broke. The metal appeared to be crystalized at the fracture point. Steel shoes make a high pitched ring when struck, these make a duller sound. In short I am not satisfied with the quality of the product and only recommend it for a cheap practice shoe that you don't care about."
3,Champion Sports Steel Horseshoe Set,One of my horseshoes broke when i threw it and it hit the concrete. I am very disappointed about that because i had high hope about this product and it is not real steel as you indicated.
1,A total rip-off,"The day after this horseshoe set arrived, my girlfriend and I took them out to the local pits to throw. Two of the shoes broke in half in the first game, ending our outing and prompting me to purchase another set of Quality shoes elsewhere and not via Amazon. Do yourself a favor and search elsewhere instead of wasting your money on this product. They are made of the lowest quality pot-metal composite and break very easily. I couldn't believe they only lasted about 15 minutes before breaking. What a waste of money. I suggest horseshoesonline.com for better products."
2,This album is awesome!,"but this shout factory remaster I foolishly purchased isn't. The remastering quality is just awful. Jerusalem is thin, dry and gets slightly louder at about 1:31, karn evil 9: 1st impression is muted, muffled and the drums and bass sound horrible, and the 3rd Impression is also muffled and is strangely quiet. I have ordered the sony and it is on the way to my house. I can't wait for it to arrive!"
5,"Colourful, breathtaking interpretation","Arrau is one of the very few pianists who has fantastic touch and crystalbright, brilliantly beatiful sound, whatever he plays. If you want to listen Brahms' Paganini variations with strong intensity and brilliant dynamic differences, every single note played with care, buy this CD. In Liszt's Spanish Rhapsody Arrau shows his breathtaking virtuoso skills, but also so beautiful sound and so different colours in different sections in the piece. True master of music, excellent recording."
5,Still Vital and Relevant,"Well, it's probably the ultimate in Washington narcissism to review your own work, but it seemed important to note for the record - now six years after initial publication - that Passion for Truth remains vital and relevant. Just last week, The New Yorker magazine quoted and cited the book extensively in a major piece on Sen. Specter, who now chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee. The book, alas, would have drawn far more initial attention if it had come out after the Senator took his larger role on the national stage. But it's still all there, and just as important and insightful."
5,Terrific,I got this album because my old English Teacher is Samba's best friend and agent/manager. He gave me MEtamorphsis to listen to. From that day on I have loved this album. It is great for anyone bored witht he repetitiveness of modern music
3,Good detail on uniforms but not on anything else,"This book provides an excellent overview of what these warriors wore but little on tactics, strategy and the men themselves (backgrounds, etc.). Excellent reference for model and figurine builders but not for those interested in what was beneath the surface."
3,Sioux Tribes,"This book tackles the topic of the Sioux tribes for fought for, or more often against, the US in the mid-late 19th Century. It is a detailed source on the clothing and material culture of these peoples, and also provides a good foundation for the study of their culture. My reason for giving it only three stars is that it strays from the main thrust of the Osprey Men-at-Arms series. Easily half the figures in the plates are either women or unarmed males, and the text does not discuss the armament of fighting styles of these warrriors in detail. For someone like me who is seeking an Osprey book that is truly about the Amerindian warriors, there are better alternatives (notably Comanche 1800-1875)."
3,"Beware, this is a permanent mount solution",This mount is meant to be permanently mounted with screws. The description was not clear and I wound up returning it. Needed something more portable with a suction cup.
3,GPS Cover Doesn't Fit!,"I purchased this Marine Mount for my Garmin eTrex Vista Cx GPS unit. This GPS unit has an internal micro CD card that's mounted next to the batteries inside. Unfortunately, the mounting cover that comes with the Marine Mount that's supposed to replace the original battery cover on the unit does not accommodate the CD card access area so it won't fit. I managed to drill away the excess plastic to force fit the cover, but I don't think it's water resistant anymore. This should only be a problem for the Cx unit. Buyer beware."
4,great variety & potential,"You know she doesn't lack confidence when you cover Linda Eder and sing Big Time to open the CD. Although Linda has more power, Lisa has better diction. Don't know where the soul of the cd is. Variety is good and she shows talent on every cut, but it doesn't flow for me. I'll put her somewhere between Liz Callaway and Stacy Sullivan for presence and style. Very good company."
5,This lady can sing!,The arrangements are great! The band is kicking! Lisa Richard is one sexy singer! Well packaged and produced. A very hip offering.
3,PLEASING,"This is a nice sophisticated compilation. I particularly liked ""Big Time"", and ""Nevertheless I'm in Love with You"". Other tracks are fine. I don't think the treatment of ""Wing and a Prayer"" is appropriate, or works. Ms Richard has a nice calm chest style voice. I would have preferred a warmer more expressive performance with some light and shade, so, unfortunately I was pretty unmoved.Singing Weasel"
3,Great Action - Tired Politics,"H. Jay Riker's book is best when the action is at sea; a little hard to take when he starts slinging the typical right-wing slander against all ""liberals"" when providing political backstory. It's cliche now and unnecessary for the story. Almost turned me off enough to put the book down, but then the action started and that was well-done, even if the outcome isn't much of a surprise."
5,Guilherme is a Superb Pianist,"This album showcases Guilherme's talents in a fresh way.Mr. Vergueiro has been a fine Brazilian Jazz Pianist since the 70's; in the same category as Joao Donato, Aloisio Aguiar, etc. etc., and here he forms a very interesting group to play the music of Mike Stoller.Some of his stellar guests are:- Pablo Silva on Drums- Claudio Celso on Guitars- Ubiratan de Oliveira on Percussionsand- Teco Cardoso on Woodwindsamong many other great musicians.Check this Brazilian Jazz master piece from one of the best Maestros in the business; The highlights are:""The Sea Horse"", ""Constant Surprise"" and ""Samba Beach"".Beautiful............."
5,Mejor libro que eh leido,"Creo que este a sido uno de los mejor libros que yo eh leido. Muestra como la mision rahma comenso y todas las maravillas que se encuentra fuera de este mundo, maravillas que todos podemos alcansar a conoser si nos ponemos en un plan de paz."
3,Not for beginners,I ordered this hoping to find some activities I could use with my intro to archaeology class but I found the scenarios to be quite challenging for beginner archy students. It takes a pretty advanced understanding of archaeological theory to really work through these problems.
5,Brutal,"Yeah, that guy that gave them 3 stars must not listen to death metal much. this is what it is, this is a HEAVY CD, the vocals are perfect, i think this guitarist has officialy taken the guitar screams to their best, its punishing, thats the best word for the assault throughout this CD, and that person was right about one thing, theres not that much variety, what do you want them to pull acoustic guitars out every few songs to make you happy? This is death metal, its meant to be heavy, and when a band does it right, they shouldnt mess with their style"
2,Disappointing,"Collector Books did not live up to its generally fine quality of productions in this guide to English ceramics. The text is awkwardly written, confusing or contradictory in places, and colorless, lacking enthusiasm. Worse, a very large number of the illustrations are seriously shadowed, a most annoying flaw in an identification guide. On the plus side, the range and selection of objects discussed is ample, and the illustrations of marks are helpful."
1,What is the Purpose of This Book?,"No focus. Book goes everywhere and nowhere. Didn't learn a dang thing and returned it. I don't use these books for prices guides..obsolete.... If you like to look at pretty photos, then this book is okay, otherwise, a collector will find no use for it."
1,not new.,"I thing Tigerdirect sent me a refurbished machine. Bad Packing, etc. I won't buy anything from them, ever. The laptop is great."
3,Somewhat O.K.,"A varying mix of D&B and Trip-Hop. Some of the songs on here are somewhat boring, but songs ""Aeroboot""(remixed by Megashira),""Northstar""(by Babyfox),and Une Bonne Journee(remixed by MGM) are really refreshing, different(and much better) styles of Drum&Bass, than the repetitive garble you're used to hearing these days. Track 4 is a strange sounding song(to me) and the rest of the tracks aren't really memorable."
5,A Must For All Pagans,This is a great book.It has so much info on gods and lets not forget goddesses from all over the world and there magical practices.Its a very good reference guide to create your own spells and path of worship.With this you can worship gods from over 20 panthons.If you buy this book you won't be sorry.
2,Shopping for Gods,"Typical of many neo-pagan resource books, this book is filled with inaccuracies and speculations about the cultures and deities it presents. Conway has compiled a lot of information here and that has some value, but the quality of the info, as well as the presentation, seriously lack. I give Conway credit for compiling a list of deities sorted by culture (and in many cases, nationality too) because I can think of no other author who has even attempted a resource like this from a neo-Pagan perspective since the Farrars published ""The Witches' Goddess"" and ""The Witches' God"". This book might be a good starting point for a very green newcomer to Paganism and/or the study of ancient cultures. Otherwise, save your money for academic mythology books that are more readable and accurate . . ."
2,Who's coughing in the background?,"Yesterday WQXR New York played Kinderszenen from this very CD during my evening drive, and I was thoroughly enjoying a truly marvelous, 5-star performance by Horowitz when...the coughing began. The first cough caught me completely by surprise. My initial reaction: maybe that's a hiccup in the station's CD player or transmission equipment, or maybe static on my radio. After this was repeated at least half a dozen times, it became clear that it was indeed on the CD itself, someone coughing loudly at regular 20-30 second intervals. It's not clear to me whether WXQR found Horowitz so enaging even with this distraction, or because they just hadn't listened to this recording completely beforehand. I certainly found this irritating as a radio listener. Be warned."
3,cover in bad shape,"The book is in good condition, but the cover was in bad shape. I am pleased with my order though."
4,Lots of fun when it was new.,"The tape plays out like a normal murder mystery but every so often stops and asks you to pick the red or blue side of cards, which changes the key details of the murder. At the end you look at all the randomly picked details and decide who did it and why. A booklet with all possible outcomes tells you if you're right, and also offers a thorough explanation of the crime.Only downside is the cheap tape they used tends to wear out quickly, by 1989 our copy was completely unreadable. I cant imagine what it would be like 23 years later. If you buy used make sure you get the cards and the booklet, otherwise the game is useless. You can get by without the little sheets with checkboxes."
1,Not for the realistic painter,"I returned this book after flipping through the pages in less than a half-hour. The paintings are more expressive and impressionist than realistic--which is great if that's what your goal is to paint. For me, I want realistic paintings down to the smallest detail. The book has demos for painting specific details like fog, snow covered rocks, reflections in rivers and streams and so on, but they aren't realistic. Like I said earlier, they're more expressive. Not my style."
4,nature in oils,this book really shows how to go from your ref. photo to painting a realistic painting..................it shows that every thing in the ref. does not have to be in the painting if it is not going to make for a good painting............
5,Covers it all!,"This book approaches the problems a painter will have with quick, easily understood examples. It presents subjects from simple to complex. A real asset to any hopeful painter's bookshelf."
5,"Worth Owning, Addresses Issues Eencountered in Painting Landscapes",This book explains how to solve problems encountered in painting landscapes. Gives a photo and painting example to show the problem and solution. Schaeffer's problem solving techniques help me capture the beauty of what I see and experience outside and in the studio. No need to copy someone else's work. Great book. It's a keeper.
3,impressionist,"GREAT CONDITION, LOTS OF PICTURES AND DETAIL BUT FAILED TO MENTION THE ARTIST IS AN IMPRESSIONIST PAINTER.."
2,The Big Book of Painting Nature in Oil,This artist should have stayed small and given more instructions and better instructions.
1,Disappointing Book and purchase,"The book was not a great painting book. I would not recommend it at all. The painter who authored the book was just not that good. Honestly, his painting was amateur at best. I am not great but, seriously, that author is much worse. Our purchase with this particular vendor was a little disappointing as there were some missing pages in the book and the book was in worse shape than advertised."
4,Queens of the zone age,I never saw the Trees but I hope that I might one day. Having bought and liked Mark Lanegans last CD I was still hankering after Vans stratospheric guitar. This really shows what a band the Trees were - you can split them down the middle and each comes up trumps. Great guitars and Ozzy style vocals are to the fore.BTW. I saw Mark play with QOTSA and he was great..
5,Six years and still the favorite toy,"My cocker has loved his spider for six years. He got it when he was still teething, so the legs went fast. The spider body has been his constant favorite toy. Every evening after dinner, he goes to his toy basket and pulls out Spider. With the spider's neck in his mouth, he fluffs his bed, settles in, and grooms Spider. After six years of nightly grooming he has licked the fur off Spider's back, so I am ordering another one."
4,bonsai wire,This wire is essential in training a bonsai. This wire is easy to manage. My wife approves of this wire for training bonsai.
4,Can we get the name of the author right?,"Amazon has the annoying habit of listing the name of the ""hot"" forward author ahead of the actual author. If you are looking at various lists, you see ""by Denis Lehaine"" . Even on the actual book page, Lahane is listed first. That is just wrong and disrespectful. A cheap marketing trick."
2,Major sizing error!!,The shirt quality is OK - very thin. The sizing is way off! My husband usually wears an XL & he needed a medium for this item. It is very long & baggy. The company agreed to waive their exchange shipping fee which helped.
3,Pink Crate,"We expected more from this product when comparing price to quality. Very light & not made very well. Look at other dog crates & compare before you make your final decision.This thing looks great in the picture but in reality,it is not made to stand up to even a small dog for very long."
4,Pojar has the best photos,Pojar has the very best specimen photos to aid identification. Hitchcock (Flora of the Pacific Northwest) is the preeminent Northwest botany text. Get both!
5,Very useful,I have several other plant identification books. This is the best one by far for my area (the central Oregon coast). The information beyond simple plant identification is exceptionally useful.
5,This is a must-have for anyone interested in PNW plants.,"I use this book constantly to identify Pacific Northwest plants and get information about the conditions under which they grow in the wild. The pictures are especially helpful. Ethnobotanical information is interesting, too."
5,Buy this One,"I have a whole collection of tree and plant books. They each have a piece of the picture but this is the real deal. There is a vast collection of trees, plants, flowers, mosses, lichens, and whole lot more (the only real thing you might miss is mushrooms, but that's a whole other book). It is printed on sturdy, water-resistant paper, and will hold up in the forest. It appears to be a common reference book for college classes. I use it all the time and love it."
3,Slow Shipping!,"I can't actually comment on the book, seeings as how I have yet to receive it from the seller. I bought this book along with several others for my boyfriend's birthday and ordered them with two day shipping so they would be here in time. The other books were shipped separately and I have already received them, but this book in particular was shipped via USPS with a delivery date of yesterday. I didn't receive it yesterday, nor today. Needless to say I'm pretty bummed my boyfriend won't get the book with the rest of his gifts, but I hope when it does come in, it's as great as everyone states. Just extremely disappointed that I opted for the express shipping & it wasn't delivered in time."
1,A joke....,Customer Service is non-existent with this product! Forget trying to get them to help you if you have a question about it. Directions are VERY VAGUE and are VERY confusing!Better to just suck it up and get your ringtones somewhere else...
5,an amazing album! way better than the first!,these tracks are just so damn funky you just gotta groove when you here it! much less keyboard orientated than the first which is great because where the keyboards lack the funky wah wah guitars pick up this one rarely leaves my disc player! truly a group of gifted and creative musicians!
3,A bargain basement CD featuring music inspired by classic porn,"I'm torn. On one hand, this CD is $10, and I've certainly spent that on worse CDs, but I can't bring myself to recommend this CD. I'm ambivalent towards it.First of all, the CD is filled with music ""inspired by"" 70's porn films (you know, back when they actually tried to have a plot). As a result, if you tried playing this for seduction, you'd probably get laughed at or worse.The funk/groove style of music isn't that bad. But it's not that great either. Haywood Jablomi and his band do a good job at doing covers and music inspired by the great era of smut.This CD makes for a great gag CD or if you find it on sale, but don't go out of your way to get it."
5,Beyond the Premise: Good music in & of itself,"Ok, I own no other 'porn inspired' music to compare with Sex-O-Rama 2. My favourite was track one. Other than an all instrumental blues cd I made up from my own collection, I find Sex-O-Rama just as easy to listen to over & over. Really, it is a lot of fun.... A friend had bought a copy a few years ago, & I recently picked up one here at amazon.You & your partner will laugh the first couple of times you give the cd a try, letting your imagination put the music to, uh, whatever you think would match the beat...A very good buy. Quality music, don't let the campy cd title or 'over the top' song titles get in the way of putting this cd in your collection."
5,Great,"Thank you! It was just what I was expecting, and turned out to be good. In a soft case, but still good."
2,disappointed,"From the image, I was expecting a nice large end cap on both ends. But there is only one - the other side is a small end cap that the paper towel roll easily falls off if you tear the paper with one hand to that side. There is only one bracket to screw the holder into the wall or cabinet, so it doesn't appear mounted straight when a roll of paper towel is on the holder. I was hoping for better and wished someone would have written this review before I bought it. it might work for you, but if you want a holder to securely hold the towels, then look elsewhere."
4,Wonderful imagery,"The beautiful pictures were what drew me to choose this book for my daughter. Wonderful paintings illustrate the story of Grandfather Twilight, who selects a pearl from an endless strand in his trunk and, at the end of every day, he takes and places it into the sky and brings twilight to the world. It's a wonderful way to introduce the concept of twilight to a small child, while still allowing them to maintain some whimsy and mystery in their world. I can see this becoming a favorite in our house over the next few years."
5,serene and gentle goodnight book for young readers,"The image of the grandfather is not found much in children's books, so this gentle telling of Grandfather Twilight's evening task is welcome on many levels. 'Grandfather Twilight lives among the trees' begins the book, and next we find the kindliest of white-haired and bearded gentlemen as he sits, reading until the day is done, and then begins his walk to the seaside. Filled with lovely prose and haunting images of forest, ocean and sky, that together create a mood of serenity. By the time you reach 'Good night', your little ones (and you) will feel ready for a peaceful night.Highly recommended."
4,Star Trek: Probe,"This book was given to me after I borrowed it twice to read it and reread it. Yes, it was that good."
3,Probe,"A great piece of literature, and a book I would suggest to anyone interested in Star Trek, especially TOS (The Original Series) fans. The only part that I didn't care for so much was the way the Oceanic Space Whales just ""disappeared"" I know that sometimes people/species and things just vanish.. but it would have been good to know more about what happened to them."
4,A good story,"I have heard that this novel was actually supposed to be the basis for Star Trek 5, but a ""certain actor"" wanted to have his hand at directing and the story was changed. How unfortunate for us, because this would have made the perfect sequel to Star Trek 4. As a matter of fact, it picks up just after the end of the movie and really is good. The character development is good, and the plot moves along well. It's sad to think we'll never get to see this one on the screen, but at least we're treated to a good conclusion to the origins of the mysterious probe from Star Trek 4. A great idea that's translated to a graet book."
3,The book that wasn't what she wrote.,"Probe was the centerpiece of a controversy several years ago between Ms. Bonanno and pocket Books. It seems that the book that made it to the shelves had been changed significantly from the novel that Margaret had written.Regardless of who wrote what, the novel itself does explore a gaping hole in the Star Trek universe left open at the end of the fourth movie. Probe takes the reader into a post movie scenario and brings the storyline to a better conclusion.Only Ms. Bonanno can tell you where the text deviates from her original. Maybe someday they will issue an ""Author's Cut"" of the novel as she wrote it.If you felt like you were left hanging at the end of the fourth Star Trek movie, then pick this novel (written by whomever)."
3,interesting,"This is an interesting book that doesn't totally live up to it's potential. I liked it, but had a problem with how the probe was handeled, but then had to be a bit of a difficult task to put personallity and purpose into a non sentient probe. Not a bad book, but could have been a lot better"
5,Great info for the jewelry lover,Great book with lots of insight into evaluating jewelry. I'm a novice and this book is a great place to start learning about how to recognize grades of jewelry. Definitely a reference source to keep. Recommended!
5,Informative and fun to read,"This is a great little handbook that's also fun to read. I would highly recommend for those who are just beginning to collect. Or maybe you just inherited some of Aunt Mildred or Uncle Bob's ""junk"" jewelry. You'll be surprised at what's valuable and what's not. I found that this book was a very interesting read as well as being a pretty good resource. Plus (and I think this is a big one) it's small enough to take with you when you're looking so you don't HAVE to memorize all those trademarks!!"
5,Best Pocket Resource for Rookie Costume Jewelry Sleuths,"For both rookie costume jewelry collectors and folks needing an informed companion on jewelry hunts. Helps you determine when items were made, how to tell what jewelry is made of using the senses of touch and smell, reminds us to take time and look at items before we rush to buy something which may not be a good investment. I wish I'd had this reference book during my first collecting year....would have saved me some money!"
4,A must-have for any old hippie,There are a few songs old hippies will recall and are just not played anymore. This CD has a few of them.
2,Low end.,Even when the camera and receiver are in the same room the picture has static. Particularly noticable are horizontal bands that roll up the screen. Both of these problems get worse the farther away the camera is. The audio suffers from distortion as well so you're better off not plugging it in. The IR night vision works but has the same static problems.
4,Good for the price,"This wireless camera has a nice, small size and generates a decent picture. For our use, the camera moves around a lot, so there is occasional picture drop for a few seconds. There doesn't seem to be a consistent reason why (losing line-of-sight doesn't always cause an interference; moving far from the receiver doesn't always drop the picture; etc.). All in all, this is a nice little camera for the price."
2,Should Have Been Called PageMaker Productivity Kit,"Unless you have Adobe PageMaker, you won't be able to complete sixteen of the twenty-six examples in the book. In addition, the book does cover PhotoShop 5.5 so those of you with version 5 won't be able to try the ImageReady examples. Other than a very misleading title and sparse PHOTOSHOP activities, the book was just okay."
2,Disappointing waste of money.,"This book wouldn't be so disappointing if it would have been titled the ""Adobe Productivity Kit."" Nearly every example ends up taking you into PageMaker or in some instances into ImageReady. There are better books for learning Photoshop tips and techniques that stick specifically to PS."
3,Neat and Practical,"This book is a color one, not liked the Classroom In A Book series that is all black and white. This little book is a practical one since it has 26 hands-on projects. It is useful for those who are new to Photoshop. It's very important for one to practice in order to understand and be proficient in using Photoshop. The reason is ideas will automactically come from your mind when you use it very often. I have been using Photoshop since version 3, therefore I only read all the hands-on projects at the bookstore. I cannot comment on the CD when I don't have a chance to use it. The only down side of this book is the price is a bit expensive for such a little book."
3,Richard Hickox Celebration,"Great sound, great complexity and a clarity so that all instruments are heard. Makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck."
4,LOOK OUT FOR THE GOSSO KING,"This second installment in Man's Ruin Records CD compilations of the DESERT SESSIONS 10"" series is great. Although the first CD (covering volumes I & II) is definitely superior, this disc is still certainly a worthy follow up that's well worth your ear's attention. Chock full of heavy tunes, this entire series is a real stand out among hollow releases of late. Tracks such as ""The Gosso King of Crater Lake"" hooked me immediately with, what sounds like, a huge old troll voice bellowing out the vocals over a Tom Waits BONE MACHINE like rhythm that starts and stops with furious thundering. Not enough Acid Kings and Melvins in your life? Then you need to pick up The Desert Sessions today!"
4,"from ""generator parties"" to Desert Sessions","The seeds for the `revolving door' line-up method that Queens of the Stone Age has become famous for were originally sown in another related project, the Desert Sessions. Dating back to the `80s, guitarist Josh Homme and his pals would throw what would become known as `generator parties' - consisting of live music played for a bunch of friends out in a secluded part of California's Palm Desert, the electricity for the amplifiers being supplied by a power generator. Between his exit from stoner rock groundbreakers Kyuss and the formation of Queens, Homme found himself with plenty of free time on his hands, and he decided to start up these get-togethers ""once more."" ~http://www.methodshop.com/mp3/. The only difference was that this time, Homme would record the proceedings - dubbing them `the Desert Sessions' - while a rotating list of quite recognizable names of hard rock would be invited to participate."
3,I needed an interpreter !,"While any story about Edgar Cayce is fascinating, this falls short for me. It is interesting, but when the author (Hugh Cayce) quotes his father, I can't understand a word he's saying. Most of the book is done in a question and answer format between Edgar Cayce and his client, in quotations (his own words). For instance : ""(Q) What form of consciousness does the spirit entity assume?"" He is asked by the client.""(A) That of the subconscious consciousness, as known in the material plane, or the acts and deeds, and thoughts, done in the body, are ever present before that being. Then consider what a hell digged by some, and what a haven and heaven builded by many."" HUH ??? The whole book is like this......impossible to decipher and understand. Reading this was more frustrating than enjoyable. I didn't finish it."
5,A great resource for Jemez Mountains explorers,"This book is great. It's full of surprising facts and hikes, and well worth whatever you pay for it. Any resident of or visitor to the Jemez Mountains will find something here for them, for sure.In addition to being clearly structured, it also has adequate maps and photographs. It's very nice.I particularly enjoyed its discussion of rumors of gangster legend Al Capone hiding out in the Jemez Mountains, though I was disappointed that it didn't cite its sources for the claims it made.If you live in central or northern New Mexico, just get this. It doesn't cost much, and if you make even one or two of the hikes suggested in this book, you will have spent your money well.This also makes a good reference tool for New Mexico writers."
4,A good bag of goodies for CUJO fans,"This album is a necessity for CUJO/Amon Tobin fans, although other artists are featured as well (I'm not familiar with the other artists). It is very consistent with his other albums. Since the tracks are collaborations with other artists, it is more interesting. The use of jazz trumpet samples in some tracks is especially a nice touch (""Z Cars""). Drum programming is on the creative side, and certain tracks sound like a perfect soundtrack (esp. ""Good Morning"") to the movie _Aliens_, or any other horror-sci-fi-action flick. There are only about 3 tracks that are dull. Also try _Permutation_ and _Bricolage_, both superb albums by Amon Tobin, for similar kind of music. It's for people who find hip-hop beats too repetitive in general, and who seek electronic music with a more hard-bop feel to the beats."
2,Not great,"The machine is ok (note small o k ) as I think I should have paid another $200 and got a good one. This one has problems producing crema, does a pour in 15 seconds (not 20 - 25 as it should), and after steaming, if you make your expresso then, it will totally waste the first ""try"" at producing expresso. It only produces a few drops of expresso then dumps the whole thing. I contacted a dealer and was told it is a known problem with all the machines. Most of the machine is plastic of some sort.If I was to buy again, it would never be this machine and I may give it to someone soon just to get rid of it.On the plus side, it does make pretty good coffee, but at $400 a shot???"
1,I feel cheated,"The ad shows a picture of regular (mamri) brooke bond box which is not available in stores so I ordered it for $14 with shipping. Note that the description does not tell you its 'Orange Pekoe'.What I got was the same orange pekoe which is available in stores for $3 !!!If I wanted the same tea, I would have walked to the nearby store."
1,It's orange pekoe!,"As someone already posted, nowhere in the description or picture does it say it's orange pekoe. Very misleading and disappointing. Sending back."
2,Rock of the 80's,"If you like music from the 80's, this CD is for you. This CD comes jam-packed with songs from the era where major stars like Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston began to rock."
5,Lyrics from her lip and melody and verses from her soul,"Tali's solo CD has been long in the making and quite awaited for. Since her initial single release under Full Cycle(""Lyric on my Lip"") I felt like some new, fresh, and melodic drum & bass was coming. After hearing a couple of singles with Suv and Patife I was a bit dissapointed (not enough melody - in my opinion). However, after hearing ""High Hopes"" (great) on the Andy C mix, and reading Knowledge Mag, I realized that Tali's solo CD was about her. Tali's is the best girl MC; that's for sure. But coming up with these verses, combined with her melody and accompanied by amazing sampling from the Full Cycle crew (specially Roni Size). This record proves that Full Cycle can still come with cutting-edge, innovating compositions. Thanks Tali abd rest for producing the best lyrical DNB release to date."
5,Favorite CDs of my collection,"This is the set of CDs you want in the car for long rides or on the radio while puttering around the house. Her voice is like warm brandy, something to soothe you after a long day."
5,She Touches Your Soul...,"I first heard Nina Simone in the movie ""Point of No Return"".. In it was Sugar In My Bowl and Here Comes the Sun. I was just blown away by how much emotion was put into each word, each note.. It's like she puts HERSELF into her singing- it's AMAZING. I am only 25, so I don't know all of the older music.. but Nina Simone really caught my attention. I can't think of any group or singer today that really captures the raw emotions in the songs like she does. I know this CD is a little costly, more than I would usually pay for a cd, but I LOVE it and I think it was well worth the price and more."
4,Great resource for developing online training,"This book is required reading for our corporate Instructional Design Certification program. I wondered how I was going to get through it and still get my work done. But, it was entertaining as well as very informative, and gave me tips that I could use right away on my project. I especially appreciated all the visual examples, the in-depth info on site architecture to help strengthen my own projects, and at last! someone who understands and offers tips on dealing not just with the client but with SME's and the dreaded Legal review. I defnitely recommend this book for anyone designing corporate Web-based courses. Even ""experts"" will glean new information. :)"
3,Welcome Back Lani!,"While she may not be a household name, Lani Hall's voice is undoubtedly known by many. She was the lead vocalist for Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66, plus she made many critically acclaimed solo albums in the 70's, not to mention her Latin albums in the 80's. She took time off to raise a family (she's married to Herb Alpert) and has come back to record a pleasant album of Brazilian tunes. On this CD she has some high moments, such as ""Tres Curumins"", ""Varadero"", ""Meant To Be"" (a great ballad!), plus an interesting version of the Brasil '66 classic ""Mas Que Nada"", done here as a dirge. The problem with this CD is that there are too many ballads. It would have been nice to have a couple of more uptempo tunes. But this is a welcome comeback for a very underrated singer."
1,Brasil Doloroso,"I am a longtime, still loyal fan of Lani's. She could sing smoke rings around 9 of 10 'names' in the lady singer ranks. Saw her do just that for a brief moment on a Christmas special a few seasons ago. Too bad she doesn't sing in the studio for us more often. And also too bad that on THIS particular outing, she chose a group of songs/arrangements that is unrelentingly depressing. Where's the beef? Where's the fun? Part of the Alpert-Mendes legacy was that the music was always FUN! Well, if you want a rendition of, for example, of ""Mas Que Nada"" that's any fun, you'll have to revert to Brasil '66, or try Al Jarreau for a TOTAL contrast. The remainder of the songs follow suit for the most part--doloroso. I still love Lani's talent, but she's really forced to hold back her talent, her verve, and her VOLUME on these songs. I was anaesthetized--not mesmerized."
3,This recording made the music known,"Having all the enthousiastic reviewers, Gramophone's award and various happy critics in mind I should not be writing this review. But I have something to say to all these enthousiastic people:I fully aknowledge what this recording has done for Dvorak's masterpiece - but did you ever listen to Zdenek Chalabala's account on Suprahon with Zidek, Subrotova, Haken et al? That interpretation is much better shaped and proves that Chalabala was a better conductor than Mackerras. Fleming is surely great, but Subrtova is not one bit worse, in fact I think she's better. And Heppner is no match for Zidek.I am not going to write anything bad about the present recording - not to cause disturbance. But maybe Mackerrras' recording was only so highly acclaimed because he discovered a hitherto unjustly neglected masterpiece. Listen to Chalabala and make your own judgement."
5,Superb,"Superb. The best opera recording of the year. The last CD is the real gold. The opera just makes you wanna cry. Fleming's dramatic dedication is admirable. I think she found an emotional connection to this role that will never leave her. Hawlata has become my new favorite bass. His voice along with his acting makes every track where he sings, enjoyable. The whole album is just magical and fairy-tale like. Dvoák wrote here and opera that will always be with me. I only wish there were more of his operas out there.If I could give more than 5 stars, I would."
5,BEST RUSALKA,"This review will be very short. This is easily the best Rusalka ever and will probably never be surpassed. Everyone involved has given of his/her best and the entire production from top to bottom is superb. This is probably Rene Fleming's best work and Ben Heppner is just as superb in the role of the Price, a performance I remember well from Philadelphia. Essential."
3,Not bad but not the best,"Knowing Subrtova, Zidek, Haken recording conducted by Chalabala, I simply could not give five stars. I like Fleming and I regard her as a one of the best current soprano, but if you could listen the older recording mentioned above, you would get to know WHAT Rusalka IS."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Do not buy this item to protect your Treo 700w PDA phone, I have used aluminum cases with my PDAs for years and have never had a problem. The second day with this case I had to slide my PDA out of the case and when I did, the case broke my phone by damaging the keyboard. I ended up having to get a replacement phone because the keyboard (specifically 1 key - Q - that gets caught by the tab that holds the phone in place) was broken by this case."
5,Los Mocosos romp.,"I love my Chicano/Latino rock pure and unfiltered. Like the days when street bands throughout Califas and the rest of Aztlan gave rock an organic Latino feeling, Los Mocosos are brown and proud. These carnales are also having a great time in ""Mocos Locos."" This a puro party band!"
5,Sha Na Ra,I LOVE this CD. I listen to it every night when I go to bed. Heartplay is the most soothing album that I own. I would recommend it to everyone.
5,Heaven`s Music.,No matter the mood-mad or sad-happy or glad-this CD-will help you leave it all behind. So beautiful in it`s Heavenly sound-a stillness comes over one-when listening to this. Listen to Heaven -buy this now!
5,Argerich is just a living miracle,"God was in an excellent mood when He created Martha Argerich, because very few individuals have been so overwhelmingly gifted. This woman has magic in her fingers and fire in her heart. Whatever she plays becomes a vital experience, never to be forgotten. Just listen to the incomparable Rachmaninoff Third Piano Concerto, in the last 40 years, no other recording comes even close."
1,The most overrated pianist of our time,Theres something about martha argerich that puts me off.Such empty playing..almost banal.Beyond that i have nothing useful to say and why should i?listen for your self.I pity persons who fancy her playing.Its juvenile and almost horrid.She plays like a philistine.
4,Great for Geocaching,"I previously used a Garmin Etrex Legend for geocaching. If I was in dense trees, it would lose satellite reception or else the accuracy would be horrible. I recently tested both, side by side. The old Legend lost satellite reception but the new Hcx maintained position throughout the search.I still haven't mastered the electronic compass yet so I just turn it off.If you are looking for a reliable GPS for off road use, this is certainly a good choice."
5,Replaced my lost GPS60CS,Its smaller and more sensitive and has basically all the same functionality as my old 60CS. Im happy with it.
3,Still Learning,"Debated for weeks between the GSMap60 and Vista HCX, ended going with the HCX. Subsequenty purchased Topo and City Navigator for a big upcoming family trip to Phoenix, Sedona, Grand Canyon and Vegas. Pretty happy with the product so far, although I've recently noticed that the compass function and direction pointer dont work unless I'm moving. I dont believe that was an issue when I first purchased it so I've been fumbling around with the weak documentation to see what the deal is. But anyway, its cool technology and I'm having fun with it, just need to learn the darn thing"
2,Missing Features from Vista Cx,"I just sold my Vista Cx on Amazon and bought the HCx because I fly a lot and like to know where I am and the Cx lost reception unless I held it close to the plane's window which always looks suspicious. I trust that the HCx will be better in the air.However, I did notice that my new HCx lacks a few features that I liked with my old Cx. The HCx has no alarm clock which I liked to use in my hotel rooms, and it lacks tide predictions that I enjoyed using at the beach. Also, the ability to view screen on the HCx is tougher to see without the backlight on compared with the Cx.Bottom line, if you don't need super sensitive reception, stick with the cheaper Cx.**UPDATE: I tried to change to three stars after I spoke with a Garmin technical representative who gave me some information. You can download tidal charts for free from their site. Also, I was told because of the sensitive receiver, the alarm function had to be left out of the HCx."
1,Freezing problem well known,I bought this unit as a Christmas 2007 present for my husband. He is trying to use it during his hikes in the Taos mountains. Unit freezes up every 15 minutes or less. Information lost. Updating the software had no effect on the problem. The internet is replete with descriptions of similar problems with this unit and there are no patches for it; unit must be replaced. I am very disappointed.
3,Garmin Etec Visa HCX,Great GPS but be prepared to spend lots of time learning to use it!! Much to complicated for everyday use and better at telling you where you've been than planning ahead.
2,User unfriendly,"I think this will eventually be a nice product. But, it is not intuitive and very difficult to learn how to use. The manual and other instructions are close to awful. Their are no instructions on how to geocache, just downloadable cache cordinates.BTW I may not be a techno-geek, but I also am not a techno-dummy (I have a real PhD). This is not a user-friendly product to learn how to use.Be advised (like I was): You'll need to buy maps and a memory chip."
3,Not as User Friendly as hoped,Earlier versions of the Garmin permitted tailored screens; this one takes more than simple effort to learn the quirks.
4,Great for outdoor use,This is a great unit for hiking or biking. The tools for driving are a little weak but that's not the main reason for buying this device.
4,Excellent product,This is excellent product. Sensitivity is equal with SIRF III type GPS. Also those antenna gives a good resolution and accuracy even in confined areas. Small size easily to put inside pocket without fuss.
2,"Good, but there is no address icon in the find menu","Did anybody else have the same problem?Is it because of the map that was downloaded?I tried contacting amazon and garmin but I got no answer back.The manual says there should be about 12 icons on the find menu, but I have only 5: waypoints, geocache, cities, exits and recent find. Therefore, I can't just type the address of my destination.Could anybody help?Thanks"
3,No Lat and Lon,The main reason I bought this unit was to track my latitude and longitude as I walk or drive. But it does not have a screen that shows this simple task.
3,A little disappointed,I just purchased the Etrex Vista HCx only to find out that I have to buy more maps. I have already spent $200.00+ is that not enough? It works great if you don't care or need to see the streets your on!
2,Total user unfriendly!,"Garmin HCX...Very user unfriendly...especially when only using a few times a year. Controls are not properly marked. User manual many times not real clear on which of the poorly marked keys should be used to get to the desired page, screen, or setting. It can become so frustrating at times when on the trail that I find myself using swear words I have not used for years. I should simply smash it with a hammer and move on! I don't like this GPS, end of story!I do have a Garmin 885T in my car and love it!"
4,Garmin eTrex Vista HCx,"Upgraded from an eTrex Venture HC and happy with the performance so far. Very similar to my previous eTrex but has a larger memory capicity that allows me to download software unavailable for my old GPS. I hope it will be as durable as my old one, that will make it an excellent purchase."
4,Garmin eTrex Vista HCx,I just think that the GPS could come with more maps instaled and with a microSD card included.
5,One Terrific Design,"I use mine for bike touring. It does it all: if I arrive in a distant city and have to drive to my hotel, I use it to navigate in the car. Once I get to the ride start, I put the HCx on the bike and it shows me a map of nearby terrain. I normally use the 0.2 mile or 0.3 mile scale while biking to show the nearby streets. I can upload the recent tracks to my computer. And, I can plot out new routes and download them to the GPS. It works all day on a pair of rechargeable AAs.It works overseas (Europe, South America), and it's even fun to take on a train trip. It shows nearby restaurants, hotels, bike shops, gas stations, etc.Be sure to buy the CD of City Navigator instead of the SD card or the download. That will allow you to set your own routes on the computer and download to the GPS.I have lost two over the years and I'm now on my third. I just have not found a better design."
3,Great Until You Fry It By Plugging It In,"I have had mine for about 9 months now. This morning, I plugged it in to my computer because I wanted to do some geocaching. A few flickrs of the screen later, the device shut off. It hasn't come back on since.If my navigation device fails on me during casual use how am I supposed to trust it when I would actually need it outdoors?"
2,Can't reach the support...,I called in for a support regarding the Topo map (SD card size difference) but I couldn't get through. Their phone system kept ask me to hold for half an hour! I gave up and going to return the product.
1,First GPS That Couldn't Point North!!,"That's right! While hiking I compared my heading against my old eTrex Venture and a compass. Heading north, the Vista HCx was off as much as 90 degs!! However, it did like going south. The further south I went the closer the 2 GPS's agreed. Also, the backlight setting wouldn't stick. Every time I powered it up, it reverted to the dimmest setting instead of the highest. Finally the display lost all contrast and I lost all patience and returned it for a refund. I feel the Vista was overly complex and the Manual did a poor job of explaining how to use it. Please note I have considerable GPS experience; this was my 4th GPS and 3rd Gramin."
1,Garmin Etrex Vista HCX,"My new garmin took me 6 hours and 5 calls to Garmin to get it to work, finally got it to work on my own. Maps do not come with the GPS, that was a surprise, no maps except major roads."
1,Waste of money,After two weeks it stopped working - wasn't able to acquire satellites. Amazon gave me the money back.
4,Ecellent,Got this unit because of the small size and thinner profile. I also have the 60CSx and use them both for GeoCaching and in the car as well. The eTrex is as accurate as the more expensive 60 series and actually has a brighter screen [even if it is a little smaller] I'd recommend this to someone looking for an accurate - easy to read - expandable - GPSr for hiking or camping and in car use. I'm glad that I bought this one.
4,Great unit,"I just received this unit a few days ago. I was planning on comparing it to Magellan Tritton 500 in some field tests, but there's no comparison. Out of the box, the user interface is so much better. The satellite locking so much faster. And believe it or not, no freezes or half finished bits of functionality - which was the case with Tritton. I love it."
3,Garmin e Trex Vista HCx,"the actual GPS portion of it works pretty good thats the good thing. What all of these things lack despite who makes them or the price you pay is an easy to use, easy to understand menu structure. If the Blackberry or Cell phone folks can make a product you can use without consulting and reconsulting a manual in detail then surely one day Garmin or some other GPS company will get a clue. Yes it works fine, does what its supposed to do but every one of these things despite how cute the color screen looks has a lousy user interface. I say it is worth the money I paid for it, and functions reliably doing what you want it to do but its slow going through the menues and the lack of a touch screen or keyboard makes it a throwback to yesteryear. I had seen it at a couple of retailer for $100.00 more so the Amazon price was good. Overall its probably the best you can do in 2009 for a relatively inexpensive handheld GPS system."
3,"Read carefully, you might need to buy something with this...","I was disappointed to learn that the person I gave this to couldn't use it right away without buying the map card for it. I don't know, I would think it should be ready to use. My purchase was for Christmas, so I guess I was in a rush and didn't read everything properly. My brother seemed to be happy with it though, so if you have any geocachers on your list..."
4,good receiver needs maps (for free),"the receiver works well, is small and light. (I even managed to get some signal through a corrugated roof and 6 inches of cement).The map that comes with the unit is useless if you want any detail. I recommend checking out gpsfiledepot dot com for TOPO maps if you want to use this for hiking as I do. The maps work with the garmin mapsource software. They are easy to install and show contours at 40 feet for some states. Best of all they are free. Make sure you buy the 2 GB micro SD card for loading maps."
2,Had Problems Right Out Of The Box.,"I purchased this product as a replacement for my old Vista. I had problems with it right away. I couldn't get it to communicate with my All Topo GPS Tool. I e-mailed Garmin and got no response. I called the support people on the phone and they were very helpful, it worked!,.......until I tried to upload new waypoints to my mapset, didn't work. Well, the first time it happened the Garmin support people told me the unit was trying to read the info on the card, of which I had no card in it. I tried, to the best of my memory to duplicate what they told me the first time, but it didn't work. This the advantage to the e-mail route, one can save it and follow the written step by step instructions. I got frustrated an returned the unit. I purchased the Garmin e-trex Summit HC. It has no card slot. Amazon didn't have this model, so I purchased it from the Garmin Outlet Store. This model worked flawlessly. I have using it for several months and I love it."
5,Best small GPS,"I always swore by the Garmin GPSMAP 60CSX but now that the updated Vista is out, it is my top recommendation for a small portable unit.Great software. If you have Topo and City Navigator it has 100% of what you need. Perfect for biking, geocaching, and even used it for driving (small screen though!)With the updated antenna and firmware, I am even getting GPS fixes inside of my office and home!Def. recommend."
3,Great unit but....,"Great unit but.... Apparently when the Etrex units are allowed to overheat, the adhesive strip that holds on the rubber band that runs around the sides, top, and bottom of the unit delaminates. This leads to a gooey mess and a loss of water resistance. I think I can rebond the rubber band down with regular silicone based adhesive. A quick Google search of this problem found that my situation is not unique for the Etrex line.I have enjoyed Garmin products for years and still intend to in the future. Garmin enjoys a well deserved pride in the quality of their products, which is what makes this discovery very interesting. But this shows a trend new lack of that quality."
3,Nice little GPS,"The eTrex Vista HCx is a good little GPS. I bought it for my son to use during a boy scout high adventure camp. He carried it with him all the time and always knew where he was and how to get back to camp. It works as advertised... but the days of these little things is coming to an end. For what I spent on this plus paying separately to buy and download topo maps, I could have bought him an iPhone with rugged case and AccuTerra software with free unlimited topo map downloads (that's what I used - and the iPhone screen and usability is so much better!)."
4,Very pleased with my new Garmin,"It's my first GPS handheld and I'm very pleased. I have had none of the problems that I read about in the other reviews. It's very responsive and accurate to 9 ft outside, as it says on the sat screen. It comes with only a base map but you can get free topo and street mapping at ([...]). I've been playing with it for several weeks and figured out how everything works, not much help from the user guide, it's very lax in all the ins and outs of the units software interface. It's excellent on batteries. I'm on the second set but only because I fell asleep playing with it and it was left on all night. The buttons on the sides take very firm preasure while the toggle on the front can be easily triped while putting it in your pocket. I'd give it 5 stars but because of the poor user guide, lack of mapping and the toggle issue I'll give it 4. I'm very pleased with my purchase in spite of the 3 issues."
3,"Fine hardware, but terrible operating software","The HCx is a well made durable GPS with very good reception and accuracy. BUT the Garmin operating software seems to have been designed by a committee of software people who never actually use it. I imagine that if you use the HCx very regularly that you will remember which button to press to get to which screen and maybe eventually it gets somewhat easier. But, if like me, you use it irregularly you will find yourself cursing whoever made the software interface for this device. Too many things are ridiculously complex to do and too hard to remember the sequences, even to do fairly simple tasks. Hopefully Garmin will improve the software as this device deserves much better."
2,garmin eTrex HCx Color,"i went walking with someone who has an eTrex vista purchased six months ago, and there was a THREE kilometer difference in the trip odometer on just a 14 km walk. our height measurements seemed to be closer, although not exactly the same. he said he would not have recommended me to buy the product after his own experience. the old eTrex (three years old) seemed to be intuitively more accurate, but its battery life made it inviable."
1,Map Rip-Off,"The maps that this comes with are useless. The maps you have to buy for it are very expensive (can easily cost more then the unit itself). When you buy the maps, you don't really own them. They can only be used in that one GPS. If you buy a new GPS, you have to buy the same maps again (not cheep) for each unit.I bought a second one of this model Garmin GPS unit and was expecting to use my basic road maps ($125) on both. I had to pay ($99) to get a code to put them on the second unit."
3,Its good but,Well I have had it for two weeks and it is a good unit. It grabs the sat-s fast and acquires a very accurate position. Base map detail is extremely basic. For any serious navigation you must purchase there mapping programs. I got the Topo Usa 2008. Detail is limited in that it needs go down to a more close up of Topo detail map. Found the screen to be small in comparison to some current PDAs. It would greatly benefit from a bigger display. Really need to purchase a least a 4 gig micro sd card to load the whole USA map. 2 gigs will hold 1/2. Took 8 hours plus to load this onto the card. Anyway I am using it for deer hunting on the east coast (Va.) right now. After more use I will give another update.
2,Screen Too Small,I found the GPS sensitivity very good. Satellite acquisition times very good.The unit is too thick. The etrex units are in serious need of a redesign. They have been the same for years. Why is the tiny screen on the bottom ? It should be on top.The biggest problem is the screen. It is too small. It is pretty much worthless. The resolution is pretty poor too.Also the included basemap is pretty much worthless. For any decent mapping you are forced to shell out another $200 to buy the Topo 2008 & City Navigator NT maps. So this little door stop will really cost you $426. Be prepared to spend even more to get the accessories that you need bringing things up to $500+Mine is going back since I picked up a Colorado 300 to try out.This unit is not recommended.
5,Great for Geocachers,"If you're a geocacher, this is the GPS for you. It's small, and the battery life is outstanding. It acquires satelites and calculates a position quickly. It also has a geocaching mode where you can store geocache locations and mark them as found once you find them."
4,great GPS,Great GPS - good undercover of trees. Poor documentation from Garmin - the owners manual is weak!
3,very informative,This book is very informative on the Cuban Missile Crisis. The author gives great prespective on the mindsets of the leaders of both Soviet Russia and America. I recommend this book.
1,deception,"I buy the product because i have in my car on high and low beam philips diamond vision ,and the product says that the ligth is white like xenon , and i thougt that they was going to match with the diamond in the fog ligth,pure lie ,the bulb is even more yellow then the original .i return the originals to the car and throw the street glow in the trash (i cant return it because iam foreigner)"
5,CAUTION!!,"This is an excellent CD, the best of Robin Gibb's solo albums and comparable to the best of the Bee Gees.HOWEVER, a word of caution here. Based on the Amazon listing and customer reviews, when I placed my order, I expected the TWO albums: 'Walls Have Eyes' AND the album 'Secret Agent' on ONE CD. What I received was the 10-track 'Walls Have Eyes,' not the 20-track CD including 'Secret Agent.'Here is the response I got from the Amazon Marketplace seller:""the problem is that the description on amazon is wrong , someone changed it.This album walls have eyes exists only as 1 cd release on the polydor label.The picture described on amazon with 2 cd's is for a pirated copy because there is no official double album by robin gibb.The only real genuine cd that exists is the one that we sell""I hope this helps others avoid problems."
5,Practice tips on Examination Materials,"This is a pretty good study guide to study from, and I would highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in getting a high, decent score. To reiterate what someone posted somewhere else, I also bought the Teaching Solutions CD in preparation for my SAT I, and SAT II, and the quality is no where near Kaplan at all. In fact, someone must had made this overnight just to get our $$! Kaplan, Princeton Review, the Official SATs, Barrons, are all good legitimate study guides, but not Teaching Solutions! Please spread the word."
4,Jerry Rivera's...,"...brother hits onto the salsa with this good cd. Hits to look for are ""Contigo"",""Dame la oportunidad"",""Mi nina mimada"" and ""Sin Miedo te Amare""."
5,Best book ever!,"I purchased this book from one of my neighbors who was raising money for her school. When I got it, my son was just a few months old and I put it aside with all the ""When he gets older books."" When he was 2 1/2 yrs old, he found the book and asked me to read it to him. What a wonderful book! I was so upset with myself for waiting over 2 yrs to read it! My son LOVES this book, and so do all of friends. I have bought countless copies and given them as gifts. Everyone just raves about it! It's a story that needs to be told. Giving your child the gift of confidence...what could be better than that?!"
1,Disappointed,I purchased this book with the understanding that it was new. Upon receiving it I found the front and back covers bent and when you opened the book it was already pulling apart from the glue binding. I was able to re-glue the cover to the spine so that it will hopefully hold. I am disappointed to say the least at how the seller represented the book as being new when it was sadly not.
2,Next time - Chiltons!,"I purchased this book because I needed to figure out a problem with the heater on my 96 Ranger. This book proved to be of very little help.There was only one diagram of the heater system with virtually no detail (page 3-9 diagram 3.11). The problem is with the heater vacuum system. This area is not even mentioned in this book.So for me, this book was of virtually no value. Hopefully, I can come back in the future and say that I was able to use this book to fix a problem. However, I will probably have traded in my truck first."
4,Helped with 96 Ranger,"My 96 Ranger had *many* problems, and this book was a huge help. I performed many repairs using the detailed pictures in it. Overall, I would recommend the book to anyone, but I wouldn't buy another 96 Ranger!"
5,POWERFUL AND SHARP SOUND!!GREAT!!,"THIS IS A RARE LIVE ACOUSTIC RECORDING OF ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS PUERTORICAN ROCK BANDS ON THIS ISLAND,THIS CD SIMPLY ROCKS!!IT'S ALMOST LIKE HEARING A SPANISH VERSION OF ALICE IN CHAINS UNPLUGGED!"
1,You can get a better bundle for your money,I'm surprised to see this bundle listed for $800 bucks. I've seen other sites with it much lower and even the actual SRP is overblown. You're better off getting one of the other bundles or getting the individual PSP 3000 and adding on your own accessories. Nowadays the 1 GB memory card that's included is horribly outdated. Considering you can now buy games from the Sony Store and download then to your memory card... you'll quickly find that 1 GB just doesn't cut it. Add some music and online comic downloads and you'll be wishing for an 8 or 16 GB card instead.Don't get me wrong on the product... it's just that this isn't going to give you the best PSP value for your dollar.
2,Butterflies Received do not look like the butterflies in the Ad..,"I purchased the butterflies for my Nieces baby shower and for the baby'sroom decoration. The price was great for this set, however the butterflies received did not look like the butterflies posted with the sales ad on Amazon.I didn't have time to return the butterflies and didn't want to deal with the return postage, so we just kept the ones we received that were ok. However, I would of preferred to get what I paid for.I probably won't purchase anything else from this vendor."
2,"Unfortunately, this is not balanced","If you are hoping for an even-handed assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of poststructuralism you will not find it here. Belsley's introduction is mainly a work of advocacy and, as such, undesirable for those looking for a reasonably non-partisan overview. Disappointing."
3,Gift for Legals fan,"My husband and I love Legal Seafoods, but there is no restaurant near us. So I thought this cookbook would help us prepare some Legal's dishes. Have not tried any yet, so not giving a high rating, but it looks promising."
5,Legal Sea Foods has a Cookbook! WOW !,"I traveled to Washington, DC and also to Baltimore, MD and many people said ""If you want great seafood-go to Legal Sea Food!"" I tried it when I was in Baltimore and LOVED IT! The Cream of Crab soup was utterly divine! I worked for sometime at Red Lobster in my younger days-so I know good seafood! Buy the book-it will give you insight into making excellent dishes at home!"
3,Battery Included,"What prompted me to buy this was that it mentioned the battery type used and it was included. I made the erroneous assumption that the battery was replaceable, because otherwise why mention the battery type. As far as I can see the battery is not replaceable and thus it's a disposable device as were previous ones I've used. The unit works fine, but I'm still faced with buying replacements in the future. I had hoped for more."
3,Needs plastic storage sleeve.,"Good magnifier, but needs plastic storage sleeve to protect lens while dumped into a purse. Wife likes this product. a lot."
4,Works well,"I am happy with the quality of the magnifier, but felt that for the price it should have come with a carrying case of some sort."
5,Second Magnifier,"I wanted a second magnifier for the house so I bought the Carson. It is a good buy for the house as the light is in the center, making it easy to read model and serial numbers, a task you always need to do at home and never have the magnifying glass to do it with. One use of reading a serial number for service and it has paid for itself 12 times over, and then some."
1,MagniCard magnifier,Poor magnifier. Also the LED is too dim and not to the viewing area. It is a piece of crab.
1,Cheap. Not worth spending even a penny on this item,"no matter which angel you use it's hard to focus. it's better to spend more and buy something which can be used. It's a joke in the name of magnifier. Please do not waste even a single penny on this one, this is just a piece of trash."
3,Byrne is a bit of a rogue,"This is as fun as any number of similar books, perhaps even more so, but there are some er... surprising features:- a fair number of the ""best things anyone's ever said"" were apparently said by Robert Byrne himself. Hmm...- Where Byrne doesn't like the quote he just changes it, Oscar Wilde in particular gets mangled- I can't prove it, but I'm sure some of these quotes are just made up: one from Andrew Mellon in particular rings false- Sometimes he gives the source of the quote, sometimes he can't be bothered- Michael Douglas is ""Michael Douglas, actor and producer"", all the other yahoos you've never heard of remain just a bunch of namesAnyway - there are 2 types of readers out there: those that find Byrne's roguishness charming, and those that don't. I'm sort of in the former group, as is Byrne himself."
3,Fair to Middlin' Quotation Book,"The title is a bit of an overstatement, but I suppose The Big Book of Light, Frothy, Pretty Good Quotes wouldn't have the same impact. This is still a fun book. Byrne sometimes tries a bit too hard to be clever, and I particularly wish that when quoting tv shows or movies he showed the courtesy of citing that actual scriptwriter.But these are quibbles. For about a half-cent per quote this is a good deal. There's something fun on every page, and the organizational approach of allowing one topic to flow into another related topic allows this to flow much better than other similar books (an index still lets you find particular quotes on demand).If you enjoy this, Laurence Peter's Quotation collection is a somewhat higher quality work with the same sort of attitude."
3,"Unusually Quote Book, but Fun","I thought that this book was funny. For the most part, it doesn't include quotations that you will find in other places. Instead the author quotes people from Johnny Carson to Winston Churchill. There doesn't seem to be an predictable connection, except the personal preferences of the author. As such, if you thing like the author, it makes for an interesting read. I guess it would be of the most use for people who want a good quote, that few other people would use. I haven't used the book professionally, but I enjoyed reading it from time to time.And, as a bonus, the author adds in some interesting pictures which I really enjoyed."
3,Dry Humor,"This is a five star book if you like dry humor. For example, here is one of the better ones: ""You'd be surprised how much it costs to look this cheap."" - Dolly Parton. If you want to read 2,547 more quotes like that, buy the book.This is not a ""wit and wisdom"" quote book. You won't learn anything. But if you like dry humor, you may get a few laughs."
2,Drama Queen,"Outside of the grammar and typos this book was better that the other 2 in this series that I read. It did tend to keep my interest a little longer, but it was still a slow plot.The hero in this story should have given up on the wishy washy heroin long before she got shot, but I guess that's true love (or stupidty).It took almost to the end of the story for her to come to her senses.If you like a lot of drama and uncertainty in a story, then this is the one for you."
3,come on!,"After reading this author's first two books, I was hooked and spent the next months waiting for this book. What a let down. So far I have seen little consistency in her writing. The only thing that is consistent is the suspense! That part I admit she has mastered and makes you want to read more. The more I read the more disappointed I became. To me this book really lacked the sizzling romance of her previous books. It is a suspence book not a romance book, at least not the quality of her previous ones."
1,Terrible,"While this laptop is attractive, and the screen looks great, almost everything else about it is terrible. Opening up a simple program like Internet Explorer took as much as 30 seconds (when nothing else was running and the computer was clean and free from any viruses). When I right clicked on the desktop, it took as much as 30 seconds for the menu to pop up. My laptop recently broke for the 2nd time. If you want an easy-to-use, quick computer, then do not buy this."
4,This laptop is COOL......................................,"Hey people,This is Arpitha and i bought this laptop a month ago and it is great......sleek,light weight,i like it........got it for a good deal and i recommend this to everyone who wants a good and wonderful laptop.Only drawback is that the battery gets heat up very soon so..........be careful..........."
3,"Doesn't last, Sony doesn't support","Mine lasted 16 months, the problem being that it ran hot. Eventually, the cooling fan gave out. A remarkable imitation of the noise a hard drive would make when failing. Backed up all data and contacted Sony about repair. They want (now) $30 just to speak to them to ask a question. Like: ""how do I get this repaired"". Once you're out of warranty, too bad sucker! They would not even provide a shipping box at my expense to get the machine to San Diego, which is where all repairs are done. At any price! I bought a new Toshiba laptop, and will never deal with Sony again. Useless. Sad, they used to be a good company..."
2,Chinese Sony is Foo-Baa'd,"PROS:Cheap with a Sony badgeNice displayPlenty of them aroundCONS:Battery life is woeful! States: 3.5 - 5hrs Really: 2hrs (at most!)Packed full of trailware, adware, etc. WTF?Toshiba 'starter' hard-drive is problematic: read: foo-baa'dGets hot, really, really quickly.Optical drive is clunky, loud and slow.... :(Support? What's that... :(Verdict:I was really looking forward to this lappy but I've realised it is not really a Sony, i.e, Made In Japan. This Chinese shocker is a pure revenue-raiser from Sony and they should know better than to put their name to this quality of product - too many bean-counters in the top jobs these days I guess. Take my advice: stay away from the Onyx model that is made in China! Hate to say it but this thing STINKS!"
2,"Great potential, but...","it didn't follow through. The characters started well but were never fully developed, and the highlighting scenes were choppy and flat...As a couple other reviewers commented: where was the romance?? The back of ""Utterly Charming"" reads as a fantasy/romance novel, but the author didn't cultivate either of these themes very well. The fantasy part seemed like it should have been supportive of the romance aspect, but neither Blackstone nor Nora stepped up to the plate to give the other some idea of their feelings until the last, oh, 15 pages.I loved her ideas though; since I finished this book I have been re-writing it my mind!I would love to find a author with similar themes, but with better prose and fully developed characters.Any ideas?"
2,She's too crabby.,"I really hard time grasping how the love interest they had in each other. It seemed like Nora was nothing but a crabby,demanding workaholic. What did Blackstone see in her in the little bit that he had associated with her? What was her problem with Sancho? Couldn't quite get that one. I think Nora just had an incredibly orenery personaility. I pictured her frowning with her arms crossed most of the time. The last handful of the chapter she mourned for Blackstone. Really? In the previous few changes nothing happened or was said to give me any indication that she had any feelings for him. Throughout the book I only got the feeling that she lusted for him. Certainly not falling in love with him. Not much romance at all. Nora could not break down and soften to Blackstone at all. Made it hard to believe that any kind of relationship would work between the two. Especially when she spent most of the book pushing him away."
2,whimsical but not romantic,"I was looking forward to this book because the premise seemed so original. It just didn't deliver. Blackstone spends the whole book trying to figure out which woman (Nora or Emma) he really wants. He doesn't have a relationship with either one of them. Emma has been asleep for 1000 yrs and Nora was his lawyer for 1 day and he doesn't see her again for 10 yrs. Nora has a lawyer-sharp mind with a fantasy-believing personality that I just couldn't buy. It became ridiculous when she was facing down a powerful wizard and witch with ""I'm not afraid of you, I'm a Lawyer!"" Then ordering them out of her house! If your looking for a witty fairy tale this is OK (Love Me Tender by Sandra Hill is better), but if your looking for a romance (of any kind) this isn't it! KCS"
4,good ideas messed up by some bad elements,"I thought that the ideas for this story were great, but every once in awhile there were annoying, unecessary comments about people's anatomy...and why would would the story benefit from a more than passing description of the fates as naked and where they had piercings ?So many of this author's ideas are really interesting, as are the ways she ""smashes up"" various myths, folk lore & fairy tales...it's the little bits of ""dung"" sprinkled throughout, in the form of ""too much information"" (sexploits, what a character thinks about another's anatomy,course humor) that make this stink in the end"
4,Fun fun fun,Cute witty and fun. The characters are believable and minor ones too. Loved the heroine s mother. Good book. Fun read.
3,"Charming, yes - Romantic, no...","I was a bit disappointed in this book. Yes, it was charming - and fun and funny! Grayson's imagination went into overtime for the plot and situations. The characters were oh! so cute and the fairytale action was non-stop. BUT WHERE WAS THE ROMANCE? There was so much that COULD have happened between Nora and Blackstone. But it didn't. They just didn't seem to connect. Read it anyway, though. I'm sure that if you are a Romance reader like me, you were a great fan of fairy tales in your youth. For that reason alone, read this utterly charming little book. It's pretty good."
1,This is a Romance?,"Why is this novel called a romance? The only ""romance"" comes in the last two pages and that consists of a chaste kiss and not much else.This has to be one of the silliest books I've ever read and I don't find it enchanting or charming, just ridiculous.The entire premise is absurd. I find myself reading a few pages, then putting the book down in order to find something better to do.I'll never buy another of Ms Grayson's books."
5,Delightful fun!,"Throw away your concept of romance, if it includes heaving bosoms and frail heroines. Nora Barr, Esq, isn't frail and her bosoms don't heave. She's a very real woman, with some pretty unusual problems - including a client who's THE prince charming, a wicked witch, and a really angry Sleeping Beauty. (You would be, too, if you'd been put to sleep for 1000 years!)Grayson puts these characters through their paces, and the result is warm, witty, silly, romantic - and utterly charming."
3,Fractured fairly tale with a contemporary twist,"Warlock and restaurateur Alex Blackstone had to cast a spell on his beloved Emma which resulted in her ""sleeping"" for 1000 years to offset a spell cast by her evil mother. Believing Emma to be his soul mate, he hires lawyer Nora Barr to help hide Emma from her mother, as Emma goes about trying to live in a modern world. Alex soon questions the fates as to who his true soul mate is -the sleeping beauty or the plucky lawyer.Grayson casts a charming spell on readers in her fractured fairy tale, but there was a real disconnect when it came to the romantic angle of the plot, which is pretty non-existent throughout most of the book. But the story itself is cute and engaging, and Grayson can write some witty prose. Too bad it has an unfinished feel to it."
4,Utterly Charming,"I found the title of this book right on target. This book is utterly charming. If you want blow by blow sex (boring!) this book is not for you. If you like a little fantasy, a fun book this is. A thoroughly modern lawyer mixed with characters out of mythology and a lot of laughs."
5,I laughed out loud,"I loved this book. I actually believed in magic for a little while! The dialog was great - fast paced, realistic & funny. Kristine Grayson just went on my list of ""must haves"" & I can't wait for her next release."
5,Charming Christmas Tale,I bought this book at a writing seminar for teachers. It is a delightful Christmas story to share in your classroom or with your own children. The Humbugs are adorable little bug like creatures who try to test the strength of your Christmas spirit. It's about having Christmas spirit and how it can't be crushed because of the things it represents. It's a terrific and timeless tale!
4,Christmas present,I wanted to purchase something for my granddaughter for Christmas. The watch will help her to learn to tell time. I think she will like the design because she loves butterflies. My purchase arrived and was in good condition. Thank you.
2,roll of towels falls off every time - poor design!,"I mounted this underneath a cabinet, with the hook opening towards the wall, as suggested by another reviewer. no luck. every time I go to tear off a paper towel, the whole roll falls out of the holder. rubber bands might hold the thing together, or some kind of lock, as others have mentioned."
3,Sturdy and attractive,"This is a very nice towel holder. I'd give it more stars if it had a mechanism to lock the roll in place. I have it on the inside of a lower cabinet door and I can't pull off a sheet with one hand. That tends to pull the whole roll up. If it had the lock, I'd give it more stars."
5,5 Stars is not enough! This album is mesmerizing!,"My husband bought this album on a whim a few months ago. Since then, it's rarely been out of our CD player, except when one of us sneaks it to work. It's a wonderful fusion of modern fiddle playing and Gypsy tunes, a combination of virtuoso jazz violin and music ethnography. Anti von Klewitz delivers an astonishing performance, singing in three different languages while she bows and plucks complicated rhythms and melodies on her violin. I can only imagine what a live performance must be like! The liner notes provide translations of the songs as well as brief comments on their origins. I was left panting for more and have since purchased other gypsy and fiddle albums, but they pale in comparison. I eagerly await Csokolom's next release, or I will have to make the trip to Europe to hear them live."
4,Hungarian music but not lyrics,With a title like Csokolom- Hungarian Fiddle music - at least half of the lyrics should have been in Hungarian but the music is still something I'd enjoy seeing live. Hope I find out about their next visit to NJ.
1,It was only okay.,"I am really disappointed. I suppose if I was just exploring music from other countries, I might find it acceptable. But with Hungarian ancestory and a ""purist"" when it comes to this music, I found the ""hungarian"" part was almost non-existent."
2,JUMP STARTER IT IS NOT,"Well, I bought this unit for the ""jump start"" capability because I have a battery that will randomly drop charge after about 5 days and will not start my car.Today I had the opportunity to try out this capability. I checked the battery voltage before attempting to ""Jump Start"" and it was down to 10.85 Volts and would not even click the starter relay. Connected the Start Pac and noticed the car interior lights go way brighter and I was elated to see this. Put key into switch and turned it to start and NADA - it did not work. Thankfully, I was parked in my garage and could get the ole battery charger out and working.My thoughts are that this unit may be great for powering ""accessories"" but not too good at ""Jump Starting"" a car engine. I would not recommend this if ""starting your car in an emergency"" is your goal..I gave it 2 starts because it ""may"" work to power accessories but in my case it did not do what I expected and I would not buy this unit again"
3,STILL UNDER PERFORMANCE REVIEW,"CONS: Does not come with Charter. For AC Charging, i was told to use any household extension cord to charge. For charging using a cigerette lighter adapter in a car, The plug needs to be purchased seperately.Does not generate a pure sine wave."
3,Not A Generator,"Great as an all in one power source for a quick job. I had a dead battery on my car. It was too dead for the allsport to start the car. It may be OK if your battery is low, but NOT DEAD. I do like the inverter, but think they should not call it a generator. That is misleading. It is an inverter from 12V to 110V powered by the on board battery."
3,You get what you pay for......,This is a pretty ordinary guitar...but even the price is ordinary so it breaks even i guess. let me put the cons first.1. the guitar action is pretty high...i had to adjust the bridge to make it more playable.2. i have a yamaha acoustic guitar and this guitar is pretty tough to play in comparision so not recommended for beginers.3. if you plan to buy one be sure to change the strings as soon as you can.pros:1. pretty light guitar considering it has a fishman pickup built in.2. sounds really good if played correctly.3. body structure and fret board are very adorable.
2,Great guitar sound! Crappy build quality..,"Although this guitar seemed too good to be true it really did sound nice. The price was attractive and the reviews were all generally positive. So I took a leap of faith and decided to order it. Upon arriving I noticed a few things:1. The packaging left the guitar open to transit damage.2. The guitar was scratched...Yet ""new""Little things but they are negatives. Yet it got worse. After two weeks of minimal, casual, use, the guitar's neck broke at the connection point between the base. Here I noticed it was held in by a small connection that was just re-enforced with glue..Sounded great! Lastly short..."
2,Rarities?,"Call this Rarities? More like: ""A Couple of Unreleased Tracks and Some Fill-in Songs""! Yes, it does have some great rare songs, but you can find Madman and Blind on Frogstomp and Ana's Song (Acoustic) on The Best Of CD. Also, I looked at the tracks on this and then at the tracks on The Best Of Silverchair and all the songs are on there aswell! I warn people not to buy this and get The Best Of Silverchair instead.PS. Silverchair, I still love you."
4,The MAMBOness continues!,"This collection, like the first one, contains artists like Kinito Mendez, Sutanejo & Perensejo, and Barimambo. Charlie Valenz returns with ""No es lo mismo II"" which is funny as the first. However, the best highlights come from the new hitters like La Nueva, Dos Pinas, and El Plebe. Only Mambo II continues the party!"
2,This single cost Britney's knee!,"There's nothing outrageous about the title song - it's a lame, mind-numbing piece of crap compared to many other songs found on the ""In the Zone"" album: Imagine ""Breathe on Me"", ""Touch of My Hand"" or ""Shadow"" on constant radio play or running on MTV. And no, we're not apparently going to have that because Britney's precious time was wasted in incorporating this bore of a song into a single and even attempting a video out of it, like we know ended up in Britney's injury. For nothing.Fortunately for this single, it's got the already legendary ""Toxic"" and a marvelous vocal mix version of ""Everytime"" - another star for that."
4,Coolz.,It did come very fast although the tracklistisg posted on the product page differed from the actual product...which did piss me off at first but I got over it.
1,if you like this you're on more dope than she's on,this isn't something you can listen to sober I recommend folks to be high while listening to this.
5,Very nice upgrade H7 lamps,"I live in an area that unfortunately has many deer killed on the road by motorists. When I drive after dark, these lamps really do the job that I wanted, that is to punch out farther to give me better braking distance when the deer jump out into the road."
5,Of Course Pre-Raphaelite Cats,"This was a nice edition, and I knew it would make a nice addition to my friend's ""cat library."" The artist and subject were pre-sold from earlier publications, such as Shakespeare Cats, and this particular production did not let me down -- I knew when I saw it she'd be delighted with her late Christmas present. I hope there are more like it and that Amazon has them available, and ships them as quickly and in such good condition as this one."
3,"new frontier, old dc direct construction","this looks like a good looking retro superman. it is, but with the advent of more and more articulation on the figure market, i would have liked this figure to have more. escpecially because this is dc direct. it's a nice figure to put at the office, but not one to really pit against another action figure. its campy, but not worth the $16 i paid for."
4,Earthrise: Shadow 3,This collection of artists froom New York's Shadow Records take the janures of acid jazz and drum and base to the next level.
3,to short,"I had recently seen this movie for the first time and enjoyed the music I heard so I tried out this composer whom I had never heard before, the music isnt bad, its pretty good, however the good tracks dont last long enough to really enjoy them, its only 40 minutes of music so unless you are really a fan of this composer dont waste your money, I consider this money not well spent."
1,It is,Let's see. It all depends on what the meaning of is...is...it...is...huh? What if the truth were told?
1,A Second trashing of a Viable tradition,"I am insulted by this book. I'm also from the PA Dutch country and have been around Pow-Wow. It's not all the shiny happy stuff written in this book. It has a Dark Side to it as strong as the healing side to it. Silver presents it in false light. She also does a bigger diservice by removing it totally out of the Germanic Asatru Religion where most of the first practitioners started and trys to make it something Wiccan. If you have a copy of ""the long Lost Friend"" you are closer to true Pow-Wow."
2,This book is not her best...,"Although I am a big fan of Silver, I did not care for this book personally. I realize that Pow-Wow is very dear to Silver, but it is a little too outmoded for the general Wiccan community. There are not many useful spells, in my opinion, and the book tends to ramble often. I encourage others to make their own opinion and at least glance through this book, as others may find it more useful than I did."
4,A truely informative book,"Actually, I think this book deserves a 4.9995, but hey, math's not my strong part; And anyways, that's not allowed here. But more along a different line. I thought this book was very interesting. I have a creative mind and am open to most ideas, but I'm not a Wiccan. In fact, I'm from a very different religion that opposes magical practices. I thought I would get the book because I was truely intrigued by magic and such. Well, I opened the book and couldn't set it down. I'm telling you, if you enjoy learning about this type of thing, than this book is for you!"
3,Interesting Ideas That Go Too Far,"David Keys' Catastrophe is an interesting examination of an event that possibly occured in 535 CE that changed the fortunes of many peoples at this time. One of the possible explanations of this event is a volcano which created a dusky film over the world's atmosphere that changed the weather and altered the fortunes of empires. The theroy is fascinating and fun kept within these historical parameters but the author takes it a little too far when he expands this one event to show how this shaped (in a direct line of descent) our own time. This what ifing can go too far and, in this book, iy does and this detracts from the actual theory itself. The book can be fun if not taken too seriously."
3,interesing premise,"This book has an intereting premise, that the world as we know it today developed in part from a volcanic eruption that shifted the balance of power."
3,Interesting but poor science,"The author presents an interesting premise and does a good job of showing how his theory would explain many world events that led to the modern age. However, although he frequently claims early in the book that he will prove his theory later in the book, he never actually does this. I was left with a strong sense of disappointment by the end of the book because I felt like he made claims without adequately supporting them. Nevertheless, his theory is certainly a possible one and, as long as it is taken with a large grain of salt, the book is well worth reading."
3,"Okay, but fuzzy","I generally enjoy the synthesis of different factors and how they influence history. And I don't disagree that such an event as the author proposed may have happened and produced various results. But this book seems to have one idea, which it cutely doesn't reveal until the final chapter, and doesn't allow for all the other factors that influence history (and climate). And as another reviewer mentioned, the phrases such as ""almost certainly due to"" tend to make me suspicious. I started skimming towards the end when each chapter was nothing but a catalog of woes, and the final chapters about the direct cause of all this were rather anticlimactic... and not very convincing as a sole cause of long-lasting climate changes. But I didn't see anything I actually really disagreed with."
2,Looking for a catastrophe?,"How much of human history has been shaped by catastrophic events? This exhaustively researched document seems like a natural place to find the answer. Unfortunately, the author's fascination with lurid details of human torture and dismemberment caused me to put the book down after just 60 blood-soaked pages. It's pretty clear that Mr. Key's interests in history do not run parallel to my own. I also found myself wondering about Key's qualifications as ""Archaeological Journalist."" I guess there are plenty of people who like reading tabloid-style history, and good luck to them, but I much prefer a calmer and scientific perspective of Derek Ager, in his book ""The New Catastrophism, The Importance of the Rare Event in Geological History."" -- Auralgo"
3,Not a catastrophe...,"Volcanologists in particular, and geologists in general have been very slow in their acceptance of the impact of large objects on Earth, attributing even the Meteor (or Barringer) Crater in Arizona to ""cryptovolcanism"". 30 years ago the lunar craters were shown to be of impact origin, but now more distant Mars has had its craters assigned to volcanism.Keys however is a journalist, not a volcanologist, and while his conclusion is probably incorrect, the possibility of a role natural disaster may have played in the onset of the ""dark ages"" may be quite correct, and his treatment of the subject is strong, regardless of the value of his conclusion.See also ""Floods, Famines, and Emperors: El Ni~no and the Fate of Civilizations"" by Brian Fagan."
4,Interesting Methods,"I have an BA in history and consequentially have read many books on varying subjects. It has always been my impression that historians have a kind of tunnel vision with regards to their particular subect.They are so focused on their one small thesis or theory that they sometimes miss the big picture. David Keys brings together material from many different but still related fields to make his arguement.I agree with other readers it is weak, but his writing is conscise and enjoyable."
3,Talk About Extreme Nonsense,"Extreme Elvin is a fairly good book. Except for all the nonsense that goes on. Some of the things mentioned were totally unesseccary and totally something that we didn't need to know. Except without it there would be no point what-so-ever to the story. I really did enjoy the book though. I love the humorous events that went on and also it helped me to understand that not every teenagers life is perfect and that like me they also go through many...conflicts. I also think that in these types of books they shouldn't have so many ""disfuntional"" families. I think that kids should know that there are happy families that don't have these heartwrenching problems as displayed in many books and particularly in this book.Even though the amount of ""disfuntional"" families is growing."
3,Kept me smiling :)),"This book kept me smiling all the way.However at one point it got so boring that I thought twice about if I should continue it or not. I'm pleased with the decision I made (continuing of course!) because it became interesting after a while. Elvin started to be cool but at the same time he looked stupid. Generally it was ok , but if you want to reaad something meaningful , stay extremely far from this one. It's nonsense , just a little bit of romance and some dowdy guy hanging around. The topic's nice and interesting, but the book's really not worth your time. Read ""Animal Farm"" or ""The Giver"" , if you hadn't already done , if you want something that'll make you think. Those books are terrific , and this one doesn't even give you a good time. So I say - FORGET IT. I only read it because I like Chris Lynch. But I'm truly dissappointed by this book. It kept me smiling , that's right because the guy is so hopeless that it makes you laugh."
1,Disgusting Elvin,"When my adolescent daughters asked for a funny book for our family read-aloud, I chose this one, and boy did I regret it! It actually started out funny, and we did have some good laughs over Elvis' insecurities and problems with clothes and girls. But quickly the story degenerated when Elvis continually was disrespectful towards his mother, and all he could think and talk about was girls... in a rather gross way. It was the first book we ever had to stop reading because of its offensive nature. I do not like to be negative about any book, but sorry to say, this one was a thumbs down."
5,A hoot!,"Elvin Bishop is in the ninth grade in this continuation of ""Elvin growing up, AKA The Slot Machine""....You will laugh out loud!"
3,The book i read was Extreme Elvin,"Extreme Elvin by Chris Lynch was really funny. I can't believe that Elvin is so shy to get a girl. Well I enjoyed this book and i liked how the author wrote it to be so funny. I think someone that is like Elvin can learn from it. Also I think this book is appropriate for high school. It mentioned alot of adult things in it and language. But Elvin had to change his whole personallity in like two months. I think Elvin changed alot and the way his friends wanted him to. Some parts of the book was boring and it took along time for it to get really intersting. I liked the chapter when Elvin had the girl he liked over and ate with them. It was funny when Elvin would talk to himself and then say it out loud and people would look at him funny. I would recommend this book because it was really good, funny, and it makes you want to know what is going to happen next."
3,Extreme Elvin was okay,"The book Exreme Elvin writtin by Chris Lynch was a very confusing book. It always had me looking back to see if I missed something or forgot to read a page or something. On certain parts in the book, it seemed like it just randomly changed scenes. At one point Elvin was at school then the next he was at a store. But the storyline was great! I enjoyed it. My favorite chapter would have to be ""By the Hand"" because it got really exciting. It just made you want to jump in the book and punch Mikie right in the face because of how he was forcing Elvin to talk to the skinny girls and not the chubby girl he wanted to talk to. I would have to say this story was appropriate for high school student and some middle school students because it talked about the troubles of high school and girlfriends and stuff. It also had a lot of bad language and mentioned some adult things."
4,"Out there, free, jagged, twisted.","Just say ""Frith""... that's all you need to know. A bizarre combination of King Crimson, John Coltrane in his god daze, and Black Flag. Buy it, buy it, buy it."
1,Worthless,"This book is absolutely worthless. The information is ridiculously vague. For example, if you wish to remove your radiator and install a new one, the steps basically say:1) remove radiator.2) install new radiator.No kidding! I couldn't have figured that out myself! And most of the book is like that. I don't know how you can cover model years 1967-89 and say anything of value."
4,too mini,"I was looking for a sauce boat what they use to serve a souffle in a restaurant. Everythign what I could find in a store was too big. These sauce boats are really mini - 2 inches in lenght maximum, good for personal serving of sauce. But a little too small for souffle toppings. I will keep them and make a personal souffle I guess, not a usual souffle what is served for 2 people"
3,B almost in the mix,"very patchy album this could have had so much potential by far the only releae that comes close is the jap import only becuase it features 14 tracks not just 11 i feel that most of the remixes on here were done in a hurry and whats more the remixes for everytime and someday have allready been released along with the remix of dont let me be the last to know (although the the hex hector edit makes a good adition)there should have been more remixes from her first 3 albums say remixs of born to make u happy, oops i did it again and overprotected, lonley and i've just begun (having my fun) and maybe a new megamix.but oh well i feel by far the best remixes are and then we kiss, early mornin' dont let me be the last to know, touch of my hand and breathe on me"
4,Love this...,This is a great keepsake piece instead of marking it on the wall of the nursery :) It's pretty big but I'm sure that we'll love having it for years to come.
5,"I liked this book so much, I bought two more as gifts","I found out about this book by accident, and I'm so glad that I did. What a great find! These effects are all great, and it's cheaper than buying text programs. I've already bought 2 more books as gifts to other graphic artists, and I'm sure you will benefit from this new found knowledge."
3,good,"You would think from the cover art this would be funkier.Aim High is pretty cool program music from 70s cop shows. Interesting, then, that this gets into an almost Iassic Hayes-Barry White orchestral feel more than it does screeching wha whas. This may be art, but remember: IT-WAS-MADE-FOR-THE-TV.If you have not heard this type of music in a long time, you may want to check this out. It definately sounds better now than it did in the 70s, when this music was, very unjustly, considered cheese.If, though, you collect program music, this blends in: a problem when buying this genre because it all bleeds together into one big undistinguishable bell bottom afro after a while. This is fine, but not a standout."
5,Chock full of treasure,"If you are after nice straight songs, bad choice. This is pieces composed for advertising and strange little ditties. Great entertainment and a wonderfull reflection of the times. A truly beautiful job done on putting this together. A truly remarkable document."
5,Amazing...,"I had never heard of ""London After Midnight"" until some 2 months ago, when a good friend of mine told me about them, and presented me to one of their songs, ""Sacrifice""... I was just flabbergasted!!""Sacrifice"" is actually a song from their ""Scenes..."" album, but ""Psycho Magnet"" is SO superior in every possible way! I don't really think any of my words can do this album justice. If you're into the post-punk gothic music scene odds are you already know them; but if that's not the case, please, PLEASE, get this album any chance you get and listen to it... and listen to it... and listen to it... and listen to it...You owe it to yourself and, mark my words, you won't be disappointed!"
3,"Occationally brilliant, but ostensibly average.","It's unfortunate, but typical that MTV and popular radio have eschewed almost all indie bands over the last several years. Even though London After Midnight's second opus is miles more interesting than most of the vacant, subhuman dreck that pollutes MTV and commercial radio; it's average juxtapositioned to most Goth bands. Lead vocalist Sean Brennan has the most alluring voice in this genre, but that's not enough to save, more often than not, a bunch of average, cold, humanless songs. I guess if MTV decided to play this it would be tantamount to casting pearls before swine; that is, the audience who's not tuning in to get an unintentional laugh. But ""London After Midnight"" deserves it. Perhaps it would spur them to even greater artistic heights."
3,Average Goth Band...,"LAM is an interesting band, but IMHO they really have to grow past a lot of the cliche-ridden riffs that form the core of their music. I've listened to this CD a few times now, and keep on saying ""haven't I heard that melody before?"". The overall sound is nothing new - I've heard *many* similar bands playing the smaller clubs in Seattle and Chicago.I'd recommend something by Stabbing Westward or Alien Sex Fiend before the Psycho Magnet album. LAM show potential, and with a new recording engineer and/or producer they could make it into the big leagues."
5,Angst-filled Fun,"I love this album. I don't take any of the lyrics seriously, but it's just terribly amusing. Their vocals remind me a little of Bella Morte, but the songs are pretty energetic and angsty. It's dark enough to make me happy but not freak me out."
4,A bit weak,"It is a bit weak but great after all. I don't like PKMN but I read widely so I'd say it's quite good. My advice is to read all the reviews before buying the book. But if you are foreign, I'd advice you to buy it at a local store and not from amazon.com but if you can wait a few weeks and want a nice, shiney book order it from amazon.com."
4,The VPO under Bernstein shows great depth and power.,"I have found that some of the recordings made by DG in the mid-80's sound ""muddy"", for lack of a better word. This recording shows some of this muddiness. Even recordings that have been remastered with original-bit mapping have this problem (Schumann Symphonies: also Bernstein). However, the music is most important and Bernstein gives a performance which speaks of power. Symphony No 41 has a beautiful interpretation of the andante cantabile and the finale is not to be missed."
3,Too This... Too That...,"Whadda ya gonna do? Reviews for these glasses noted that the Tortoise color was too dark and... IT IS. They look black, even in bright light. AND it was noted that the glasses fit too tightly at the bridge of the nose and... THEY DO. Of course these noted shortcomings were negated by other reviews, undoubtedly written by family members of the manufacturer. Whadda ya gonna do... with glasses that are painful to wear? Must note that I have a VERY average sized head and nose, which may be useful as estimating sizing goes. Good luck."
2,Uncomfortable,"I used to have true ray-ban wayfarers years ago, then I lost them. I decided to buy this replica for its good price and a positive reviews. Delivery from CA to Poland, where I live, was only about a week and a half. On the first look, they seem almost like RB 2140 wayfarer, but when I put them on, I could instantly feel the difference: the bridge is much too narrow to fit comfortably on my nose (which is quite unlike the original 2140 wayfarers). On the other hand, the frame and glass lenses are nice and heavy, like in the real ray-bans. The frame is nicely polished, but with some dents. Overall, the glasses look pretty good, but they are so uncomfortable, that I will never wear them. After this experience, I decided to go for original ones."
3,Good not great,They look great on you but don't expect a high quality sunglasses... The best you can buy for less than 20 dlls.
2,"Wrong product, zero assistance!","I Received the wrong type of sunglasses and wrote to OC Shades about this. Over two weeks have passed since my email and I haven't gotten any type of answer, I don't know if they have even read it. Don't buy from them!"
2,Bob T from Alabama,Not what I thought these would be. They are too big and back me look like a blind man.
3,Wrong picture,"i got these sunglasses and was surprised to find that the lens was a black to gray gradient. If you like an effeminate touch, I guess these are alright."
4,Awesome insight on the bible!,"While reading this book, I really enjoyed the author's comical spin she put on the stories in the bible. With that, those stories are drummed up in a completely different light. She supports her position respectfully, while at the same time, dissecting the Christian religion. I would'nt recommend this book to anyone that's easily offended, or without a backbone. But to anyone who read the bible and questions how the stories go, this book is definetly a must have.Enemies Among Us"
5,The Born Again Skeptics Guide to the Bible,"Suppose you had never heard of Christianity, and that next Sunday morning a stranger standing in a pulpit told you about a book whose authors could not be authenticated and whose contents, written hundreds of years ago, included blood-curling legends of slaughter and intrigue and fables about unnatural happenings such as virgin births, devils that inhabit human bodies and talk, people rising from the dead and ascending live into the clouds, and suns that stand still. Suppose he then asked you to believe that an uneducated man described in that book was a god who could get you into an eternal fantasy-place called Heaven, when you die. Would you, as an intelligent rational person, even bother to read such nonsense, let alone pattern your entire life upon it. --- from book's first page"
3,A Mixed Bag....,"Part One is a rant. The author follows the Bible trail with remarks that are all-to-often more scornful than they need to be. I don't think a Christian would be won over by it. However, Part Two is interesting and readable, and persuasive. I think it could stand alone."
1,Waste of time and money!,"A complete waste of time and money and not even what the description states it is.For example the forward reads, ""...simply invaluable to anyone engaging in debate with religionists over the merits of bible contents."" Then, the argument over whether or not David actually slew Goliath is handle only by asking the following question, ""Why, when he'd had such good luck with the slingshot?"" Are you kidding me? I'm supposed to successfully argue that David did not kill Goliath by using that question?A MUCH more well written book is ""101 Myths of the Bible: How Ancient Scribes Invented Biblical History"" by Gary Greenberg who not only tackles the arguments thoroughly by covering both sides but also by using scriptures to prove the point.The Freedom From Religion Foundation should be embarrassed to have released this book."
2,Slapdash sarcasm,"Many years ago, this was perhaps the first atheist book I ever read. I was unprepared for the sarcastic vitriol atheist writers can produce. Green represents atheist writers at their worst. (Don't worry, believers. We're not all like this.) Green was no professional author. She was also no professional Bible researcher. She randomly gathered lots of anecdotes from the Bible and presented them in the most sarcastic way possible. Though the things she says are true, she says it in a way that will alienate Christians instead of persuade them. There are other books that demolish the Bible in a much more complete, dispassionate and systematic way. Don't bother with this book unless you want to read a cheap shot at Christianity. Peter Roode's review of this book is the most accurate."
2,Bits and pieces,"I bought this book expecting a ""guide"" to the bible. It is not a guide in any systematic sense, but a series of unconnected essays full of homespun wit, few of which I found especially witty, and few of which are, in my view, a serious attack on the bible or christianity.It spends a great deal of space on the bible's role in oppressing women, which is something that doesn't really interest me, being neither a woman nor an oppressor of same.I flicked through it but there was nothing much there for me. I was going to give it a three, but for me personally it didn't even rate that."
2,Long handle bath sponge,"I found this item lacking in an important area, rigity of the handle. It is composed of a long flexable plastic I-construction handle that gives quite easily under slight pressure. This item definately needs some design rework."
5,The Best in Bass,"I just got this CD today and it was hard to find nack in the days, i just never checked Amazon. Yeah, this CD hits hard, DM Records is ""The Best in Bass""."
1,"Horrible, don't waste the money!",It doesn't show you how to scream. It doesn't give you anything to practice. It is absolutely not worth a penny if you're looking for a comprehensive vocal technique. The Art of Screaming is light years better. Just go buy that one.
3,DVD review,The first DVD was way better. ZoS2 expands on the lessons from ZoS but for the full price it isn't worth it. The first DVD is great but this one is just okay.
3,Slightly dissapointing,I got this cause I wanted to stretch my vocal abilities and be able to scream and yell as much as I wanted and not be sore the next day. It has helped as far as that goes but if you are buying this in hopes that it will Teach you to SCREAM then you should go somewhere else. It talks all about making it so you can scream and not hurt yourself and not about how to scream like those bands you like.
5,One of the great artists of the twentieth century,"Maxine Sullivan's recordings from the late 1930s through the early 1940s are not widely known. She, however, is one of the great jazz artists, with a lilting, musical delivery that one usually associates with Billie Holiday. Her voice, particularly in the early years is pure, clear and beautiful. It's as if Peggy Lee's voice was crossed with Holiday's soul. Sullivan's music is all swing, deeply and joyfully immersed in the music. There's no loud, bombastic, self-serving delivery here, so if you are a big fan of Betty Hutton, Streisand, or Mariah Carey, this may be too subtle for you. If you love Billie Holiday or Peggy Lee, you'll love Maxine Sullivan. Sullivan had a resurgence in the 1970s and she was very big overseas, but she smoked and her 1970 and later recordings sound a little raspy. But her delivery and the result is always fine."
2,A nice voice but nothing special,"Maxine Sullivan was catapulted to fame in 1937 via her recording of ""Loch Lomond"" with the band led by her husband of the time, bassist John Kirby. She had a light voice of limited range (I'd say about one octave) which she used sweetly with a ""cool"" delivery unusual for her time. She recorded standards as well as remakes of old British and Scotch folks songs like ""It Was a Lover and His Lass.""But honestly, she was nothing special. There were so many other pop-jazz singers of that time who could sing rings around her, Connee Boswell, Ella, Billie, Helen Ward, Mildred Bailey, even June Richmond. Check them out if you don't believe me.This is OK singing. I have four of her records on a John Kirby compilation and I like them primarily for her cool style which was unusual for its time, but I'd think twice before buying a whole CD by her."
5,Simply a wonderful book!,"My husband purchased this book for me because I was having trouble accepting an upcoming move. At first I was hesitant because, after moving so many times, what else was there for me to learn? I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised. It is a very easy read, and the author makes you feel as if she's speaking directly to you, understanding your fears and frustrations. This book can be especially helpful for someone facing their first move. And also be advised, this book is based on the Christian faith and relying on it to help you through your move. For me, it was a definite plus."
5,A New Beginning,"Susan Miller's book helped me to understand my feelings of disconnect, isolation, and fear of the unfamiliar after moving to a new place as a single woman. It was a comfort to learn that many other women share the same or similar experiences."
5,So helpful!!!,"I was given this book from being part of a ""Moving On After Moving In"" group that Susan Miller has started and are all over the US. This book is a GODSEND, truly! I lived in one general area for my whole life until my husband lost his job and took a new 12 hours from home! Intellectually, I understood the need for the move but my heart was broken! This book helped me see I was normal and has given me amazing insight! :)"
2,Misleading Advertising,"This is misleading advertising! After the Boxes are Unpacked is published by Focus on the Family and is written from a very Christian perspective. While this may be a valuable slant for some, I would have appreciated knowing it was a religious publication BEFORE purchasing the book"
2,Paperback Books,"I thought these books were going to be new, but they were not even close. More than half of one of the books was highlighted and the other had stains all over the top and bottom. I was disappointed."
4,"Grey Wolves Howling, Chechen crisis thriller","A thriller of international crisis and adventure, Peter O'Neill's Grey Wolves Howling builds a personal epic amidst the struggle of the Chechen people against the Russian empire.It tracks Garyk Ivramovich Gadayev's personal life as he joins the Russian Army, fights and is wounded in Afghanistan, and joins with opposition forces in Russia and Chechnya. His nation and people crushed by the Russian invasion, he reaches out to the Muslim freedom fighters to plot a terrifying act of revenge.Grey Wolves Howling is set against a background of regional history and current headlines, and is informed with a feeling for the bitterness and desperation of defeat. It transcends the typical thriller genre, of glamorous backgrounds and preset heroes and villains, to provide insight into the struggle of nationalism against a dying empire. And, oh yes, it does build to a shattering finale."
4,Inspiring,"It's funny that you can't get a hold of people who write reviews, I notice the other reviewer mentions that his father is related to Father Mariano and so am I! He is my grandmothers cousin and she is the one who recommended the book to me. She had her copy stuffed with a bunch of newspaper articles that had been done on him. It was amazing to read such an inspiring story and know that I was somehow connected/related to this amazing pioneer. My family hasn't heard from him since he last appeared to speak at my aunt's funeral, more than a decade ago. We may never know what happened to him, but regardless of his fate, I'm sure he's been rewarded for his amazing feats."
1,Scare Tactics,"I've read a number of books on the Fed, including Greider's excellent book. I also like certain of the ""conspiracy"" works. This book, however, is juvenille in both respects. I knew I was in trouble when the author breaks the news that banks don't have money, they're lending out money from other people and making money on it. I thought everyone who saw It's A Wonderful Life knew that one already. I'd save your money, there's nothing earthshattering here for anyone who understands anything about the banking system."
1,Pandering to the Fearful,"As of 2/21/06 the reviews breakout as *****=72 ****=14 ***=1 **=2 *=10. My thoughts are reflected in the existing one star reviews.Carefully look at the author's credentials for this book and think about what you might expect.I wish I'd taken the extra time to check this book out of the library rather than buy it.I thought the book was a mixture of dumbed-down, historical conspiracy fiction and over-blown hysteria meant to foment a sense of panic and paranoia. It reminded me of the old Harry Browne books of the 1970's with predictions of catastrophic economic collapse, the salvation available to those with gold and silver coins, and the imperative of numbered Swiss bank accounts.Every decade since Browne, one small group of authors after another have funded their old age by publishing visions of a financial Armageddon. Evidentally there will always be a market for this sort of material."
4,The Federal Reserve. A Bank Cartel.,"This book is a must read. Once you pick it up, you can't put it down. You will never see your bank in the same light again. It details how we get the money we have in our pockets and our bank accounts. The book explains how the central bank cartels were created in history and how they manipulate the economies of the world. It explains how we, the citizens are just pawns in a power play for world power and wealth, at your expense. Just another conspiracy theory? That would be a very naive perspective to say the least."
1,Sad,"that so many people are so easily convinced by what is a mere distraction, a means to 'help' them to not look at the system as a whole but, rather, fall into the illusions of conspiracy theory.By doing this, the book performs wonderfully as propaganda.At least as importantly, the global financial system has, over the last decades, transformed in a manner which substantially weakens the power of any central bank, including the Fed.Clearly, those enamored of this book find it more comforting to imagine some central controlling power rather than to face the realities of increasing uncontrollability.Big 'thumbs down'"
2,Drivel,"This book is silly and unobjective.It should be clear from the outset to anyone who reads this that its claims are unfounded, sensationalist, and wrong. The author has neither the academic credentials nor the requisite banking experience to even pretend to provide an objective view of the Fed. I don't know why publishers don't do more fact-checking before sending garbage like this to be printed. Perhaps because they understand, like the author, that even in our modern society, people regularly throw good money at doomsayers and shamans. It's unfortunate that their understanding of money ends there. (Fortunately I picked this up at the library and didn't waste my money.) I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading this book. However, I would encourage everyone who reads it to not make it the first or only book they read on the subject. There's too much good material out there to allow this to become a primary resource."
1,Disaster for bankers,"If the information contained in this book gets into the hands of too many people, this could destroy the money monopoly machine owned by the Rothchild family, the Queen of England et al.It could all come tumbling down for these fine people - what would they do?"
5,Wow.,"Griffin keeps it simple, dramatic, and compelling. - I couldn't put it down. - Expect to be preoccupied with thoughts of the impending crisis fortold in ""The Creature"". - If you don't want the truth - don't ask the question."
5,a must read,"dont let the title of this book throw you off. you will definitly love it once you dive in. it should be a ""required reading"" assisgnment for all highschool senoirs."
3,"interesting ideas, poorly presented","There is a lot of interesting information in this 600+ page book, unfortunately, Griffin uses a lot of colloquialisms and presents conclusions without evidence a little too often, and his personal agendas are far too obvious for this book to be considered objective. Overall, the writing is not up to the standards of other nonfiction you might read. Still, I appreciate Griffin's deliberate introduction and summary sections for each chapter, and his advice to read those first. The book is easy to read, and the content has never been more relevant. I imagine that reading this book plus a pro-Fed one might give you a good perspective on banking in the US and the world."
3,conspirational,"Although the premises in this book are vary interesting and educational, I felt that the Federal Reserve has changed a lot since its inception. Especially after the 1951 Accord.. I don't see it as a demon, but maybe only as just a ""creature of Jekyll Island"""
2,Impaired by disinformation campaign against socialism,"The research on the creation of the Federal Reserve and the historically worsening situation of taxpayers bailing out greedy banksters was presented well. I only skimmed the book after I became disgusted with the author's belief in a socialist plot to run and ruin the world.In the final analysis, this off-the-mark thesis makes the book a waste of the author's considerable talent and of the reader's time."
5,A picture of Rockefeller buying the land for the UN. Priceless!,My favorite part of the book is the picture of Rockefeller buying the land for the UN building in NY.it is Priceless. It just proves that the Rockefeller and Rothschilds are in control.
5,The Bankers Secrets Revealed,"I first read this book back in 1998. I just got done re-reading it because I work in the financial industry and I wanted to re-arm myself with some good information to advise my clients about. As I write this Sunday 8/12/07, we have seen this Fed spring into action the last week just as Mr. Griffin explained they would when the s**t is hitting the fan. They created $38 billion out of thin air to bail out the hedge funds and institutions with corrosive sub prime mortgage bonds on their books. We are starting to see the alchemy of modern finance come apart at the seams.I also loved this book because it reads like history book. This country is in bad shape because of central bank planning. It's time to get back to sound money like the founders stipulated in the Constitution. Vote for Ron Paul for President."
5,Required reading,"This book should be required reading for all Micro and Macro Economics courses, and for all history courses starting in the highschool years. If our students were to read this book, so much that now befuddles them, would become abundantly clear."
2,Not sure this is worth it,"I bought one of these and the first 1/2 dozen balls it worked great. The balls spun, I marked them, I moved them and respun, they went back to the same spot. I gave a good review where I bought it. The next 1/2 dozen balls, when I put the pen to the ball, it knocked it off line, and would not line up in the same spot again. At first I thought maybe the ball was wacko, but 6 in a row? I wrote the company asking what was going on. It's been over a week and no response. The batteries were brand new, the balls were brand new, I had it on a level surface."
2,PEN DRIED UP ON DELIVERY,"When I received the unit, the pen did not function at all. The ink was DRIED UP! Very disappointed! I think this is the normal way it is delivered because the first thing that you see is ""how to order new pens""!!!"
4,Works Great,The item is easy to operate and comes with everything you need to mark the golf balls. I've used the marked balls for about 6 rounds and I'm not sure it really makes a difference.
5,Winning golf ball spinner.,"Hi There, I don`t do reviews has a rule but has i`ve had three golf ball spinners i found this one to be the best. What made it stand out, was the light that tells you when its up to its max speed, it takes out the guess work you have to do with the other models. You can also mark the center of the ball, by placing it in the bottom recess to mark the line all the way round without adjusting it or using another line marking aid. Also it seems to have an higher spin rate then my other models. All in all, its well worth the extra 5 i paid of it.And being a 4 handi cap player you need things like this to work right.The check and go ball spinner is the one to buy."
3,Realistic Artists Beware,"This book was obviously meant for Impressionists. Being a realistic artist, I realized this mistake too late. The pictures and demonstrations had little to no detail, and colors seemed to be often used incorrectly. It was not quite abstract, but it definentaly did not look real. On the other hand, I must admit this is a great book for Impressionists. There are a ton of demonstrations and examples, and it really is, like the title says, a ""big book."" It covered materials and other basics relatively well. Overall, I am not saying that this is a bad book, this review is simply a warning to realistic artists."
4,Quite a good book,"This is a quite good book to paint different types of landscapes, even I find it is difficult for a person without experience drawing landscapes. I usually draw other kind of things and I'm not bad at all, but with this book it isn't very easier, even it has a lot of drawings and projects, I think it should have more step by step explanations in some of them."
1,artist needs to take a few lessons,the artist is obviously unskilled this purchase was positively a complete waste of money thank goodness I paid less than $5 for it
2,Not particularly englightening.,"The type of work this artist does in pastels could barely even be called impressionistic. A better word would be ""sloppy."" I had hoped for some more detailed instruction on how to accomplish realistic renderings of nature, but not only are his color choices inexplicable his drawings are terrible! A better book for how to use pastels is Guy Roddon's ""Pastel Painting Techniques."" His work is also loosely interpretive, but his instruction in the techniques is longer and more instructive. What I would really like to see is a book that instructs artists on how to achieve *realistic* effects with pastels. I know it can be done!"
1,Not as pictured,The photo shows WetNap brand. That is not what was shipped so I had to return it. False advertising!
4,Great example of Heavy Seventies Hard Rock!,"This 2nd of 3 releases from JERONIMO, 1971's S/T disc, ""Jeronimo,"" is bluesy at its core, with many changes in tempo, and riff, and a fairly straight-ahead rocker. Undeservedly overlooked. For those interested in this band, this release, ""Jeronimo"" is harder and more focused than the ""Cosmic Blues"" debut, or 1972's ""Time Ride."""
3,Not what I expected.,"It seems to be very thin, I was expecting a thicker case. When I try to take it off my phone it feels like I'm going to break in half."
2,"Flimsy, but cute print","It protects the phone for sure, but it's very thin and near impossible to remove. I almost damaged my phone doing so!"
5,Great buy.,My kids love the Backyardigans and now they can watch them anytime. We bought these to use in our car when we are traveling and they work out great for that.
5,Mostly original videos,"I didn't want to buy something that we could just DVR, so this was a good choice for us. Also, with 3 on a DVD it made it good for a road trip! Some of them were on TV, too, but there are at least 3 or 4 that I haven't seen before."
1,A fine anesthetic,"The first few pages of this book starts with a dry, droning exposition of a dry man in the military. Does Tony have a personality? Personalities are defined by doing. But Tony doesn't do anything worth noting until maybe he's with Karen a few pages into the book.Even then, the exchange between Tony and Karen isn't that interesting. These are clearly normal people with normal thoughts doing normal things. I'm a normal person. Don't bore me with minor variations on my own life.First pages are critical. Grab the reader there. I paid you to entertain me. Don't make me work for what I paid you to do. Don't make me wait. Introduce conflict early. If not conflict, give us the first clues why the main character is special. Show us why we shouldn't be indifferent.This book didn't grab in the first few pages at all. So I shelved it and moved onto a different author."
1,Unrelentingly Dull !,This story was a poorly plotted novel with leaden dialogue and paper-thin character development. The story line wasn't remotely plausible. Don't waste your time or money on this one!
1,What am I missing????,"I haven't written any reviews prior to this one but felt compelled to do so now. Let me first say that I admire anyone who can put together a book of any kind because I certainly couldn't. However, having said that, as an avid reader always looking for new material, I purchased this book based upon the glowing reviews I read here. To say that I was disappointed doesn't begin to describe the thoughts in my head as I trudged through the book. I finished it only because it was such a quick read. I found the plot simplistic, the characters and dialog silly and downright laughable at times. I guess I'm writing because of the outrageous cost for a paperback that was so amateurish. I'm sorry to be so hard but if anyone is contemplating a purchase you'd be well served to look elsewhere.....you've been warned!"
5,Haunting,"In his book STRIKE HARD, Kevin Grover has penned a tale that is too frighteningly realistic in the face of todays terrorist activities. The author places you in the midst of a high powered theft by a group of today's scariest people. Mr Grover's debut novel will keep you turning the pages. His familiarity with and knowledge of his characters and the setting give the reader a sense of reading about an actual event instead of a piece of well written fiction. I eagerly await this author's next thriller. ...."
2,"Not bad, but nothing special","Grover shoots for being Tom Clancy, but definitely doesn't have ability to create taut, tension filled moments.A few plot twists stretch the imagination. A few others are well telegraphed that when they arrive it's no surprise.The writer has some talent....let's see how he develops it in his next novel."
3,Good for those with a casual interest,"The statement in the product description that this book covers ""every battle, engagement, and attack fought during the Civil War"" is of course absurd. Where, for example is Baton Rouge where there were hundreds of casualties on both sides including a Union general? But 131 are described, with maps, and that would likely satisfy most with a casual interest in the War, especially those like me with a poor memory who think ""was that the battle where. . . "" The maps appear to me to be minimal but enough to give the reader the general idea of where the major units were. Far better than nothing and doesn't take up much shelf space."
3,Short and Sweet,"This book is well organzied and priced right for what you get which is a short narrative and crudely drawn map for what appears to be every engagement of the Civil War. What it lacks, as does every other battle map I've seen, is the information needed to correlate the terrain and roads of the period to that of modern day. Of the two battlefields I have visited since buying the book, the map was helpful in locating the positions for Big Black River Bridge but horible for Champion Hill/Bakers Creek both leading up to the seige of Vicksburg, MS."
1,Do not buy this book!,"I bought this book about 6 months ago when I didnt know more than a few basic *nix commands.. I hated it then and still hate it (I would like to think im an experienced linux user)The installation guide was lacking, organization was absolutely ugly, detailed information particularly and even info that you can grab on to and use simply wasnt there."
1,Lots of information but badly written.,This book really made me angry! The only structure that was provided seemed to be the chapter headings. The information provided to perform any of the many operations that I attempted in Linux was just inadequite in almost every case; especially for a book this size! It seems to be a book that was poorly planned and made to sell.
3,Good Overall Introduction,"This book is a great introduction to LINUX. The authors have done a good job of bringing the many, many facets of LINUX into one place. You will find though, that as you delve into depths of some aspects of the system, that additional, more specific reading will be required. That aside though, this book definitely belongs on the shelf of anyone beginning their adventures in LINUX!"
1,"Superficial nonsense, no depth, no suspense","Thank GOD that I checked this out at the local library, rather than bought it...The characters are cardboard cutouts, the suspense was nonexistent, there is NO moral dilemma, the main character seems to exist in a relationship vacuum (no parents, no siblings, no significant relationships other than the unseen ex-wife and new - albeit generic - girlfriend?). The ""hook"" - that he decides to kill molesters - is interesting, but the plot execution (sorry) is patently absurd. These predatory people are cunning survivors, not just the hulking stereotypical monsters portrayed here. The relative ease with which he - a lawyer apparently untrained in firearms - dispatches these scum is painfully comical.In short, reading this book was a waste of time."
1,Don't waste your money.,This book was boring! I will not be buying anything else this author has to offer. Save your money or buy it in paperback.
1,Very disappointing,"I've really liked most of Tim Green's other books. This one was not very good, however. The plot is very weak and unbelieveable and it ends with a Hollywood ending I would expect to find in a movie-of-the-week on TV and not in a thriller novel. As the story goes along, it gets more and more absurd, more and more predictable, and there are lots of errors and holes in the plot which made getting to the finish a bore. (By the end, I was shouting at the book, yelling, ""These people can't be this dumb!"")I know Tim Green can, and has, done better with his writing. I liked his earlier works and thought they had great storylines. This one just doesn't live up."
2,Not his best work,"I found this to be a so-so murder/thriller. (Not much of a mystery, he tells you right off who is doing the killing) I had to push myself to finish this book."
2,Not great.,"This book could have been so much better. The characters were flat and overdone, the story not as suspenseful as it could have been and, what should have come across as an overwhelming moral dilemma, just didn't come through. It wasn't horrible, but it certainly wasn't great."
4,Tim Green winner,"Tim Green does a great job. The character is Troubled. It is classic. You root for the ""bad"" guy. Great ending."
4,Good book.,"Tim Green did a great job with this book. I am a little skeptical about the ending. In other words, I was not amused. Besides that, it was a great read."
5,Great Suspense Book!,"Tim Green is an excellent writer. This story brings you to the edge of your seat. Tucker Anderson's Review gives you the just of the story so I won't bore you with a repeat. It is read very well and the dramatization is excellent! You will enjoy this book on Cassette. My entire family listened to it while on a long vacation trip and it kept each of our interests. My daughter, 14, actually listened to it a second time! Great story - Great Drama!"
2,Not so Much,"To predictable...the characters where developed well, just didn't like that I knew how all of it was going down. I doubt that I will read anymore of her books."
2,Not Debbie's best work,"I think the angels are really corny characters in this book, especially their silly meetings. I think Debbie did a great job with the story lines, but the angels just did not click for me."
4,Good book. Great company.,"I received this used book quickly and efficiently from the book company. The book was in good condition, as promised, and I am really enjoying reading it.On the book itself: this is a delightful tale about three angels sent to help three sets of humans. In Debbie Macomber's classic style, the story is sweet, charming, and a little foofy, just in time for Christmas. A very sweet, heart-warming tale for Christmastime."
5,Angels Everywhere,"Angels Everywhere, written by Debbe Macomber.This is a wonderful story, funny but also uplifting. It was well written and presented, easily read on a kindle reader and I can fully reccommend it."
1,The absolute worst discs I have ever used!!,"When I saw a 50 pk spindle of 16X DVD-R for $29.00 I jumped to buy them. After burning 3 4gb+ ISO images as well as 2 data discs, the problems started.I tried on two different 16X drives, using Nero and DVD-Decry****, on two different PC's. All burns would max out between 11X and 12X. The worst part is that EVERY burnt disc in UNREADABLE in every PC or NB I tried. The disc is either not recognized or, worst, I caused SEVERE CPU UTILIZATION (100% CPU in Explorer.exe when accessing disc)!!! This happened on following Machines: Acer Aspire 3002, IBM thinkpad A20M, Generic Tower with sames DVD drive as used for burn, and Dell GX280. I would love to hear from otere folks, did I simply get a bad batch? Unreal..."
3,"Good for classroom, not for self-study","This book contains a lot of valuable information. However, for self-study, there are too few examples and no answers provided to the problems. It's sometimes hard to decide whether you understand because you don't know whether you're solving problems correctly.A solutions manual would make this a 5-star book.In a class-room setting, I'd give the book 4 stars."
1,Crappy Quality,I just got this book in the mail and am really disappointed in its quality. For $130 I was expecting a good quality binding and pages. I bought it new from amazon and I can barely open the pages because they are warped so badly. The binding is so fragile I am afraid all the pages will pop out of it if I open it all the way.Prentice Hall - you guys should be ashamed of yourselves.
1,Book is not student friendly,"Book shows minimal content, when detailed descriptions are neededNO ANSWERS TO PROBLEMS IN BACK OF BOOKPAPER BACK, that is a rip off to all engineering students."
2,Very reader un-friendly,"This book is perhaps the only text book in the market which deals with this particular subject. This is perhaps the only reason why the book is still being sold. The book is very difficult to understand. The language is often cryptic and the most critical mathematical steps are ommitted during derivations which makes this book practically useless. However, if you are already familiar with the principles of Advanced Solid Mechanics, you may find this book relatively useful. Until someone writes a better book, I guess we are stuck with this."
5,The best Clash experience,"Some ""best of"" records are compiled songs by third-parties, with few expensive ones (hits) and the rest of it is there just to fill in the blanks, all in favor of the issuer to make some money off of it. These ""best of"" records are not made of songs chosen by the band, unlike this LP.I would recommend this LP for fans, and also for people who wish to check out the band, for it contains only the chosen songs from 1977-1988, and it is a very good insight in the band's career."
4,This book is a MUST HAVE,"I couldn't put this one down!!! I am in a ""complex sales"" industry and the group that I head up are working on implementing Jeff Thull's Prime Solutions, based upon his Diagnostic Business Development system.I read ""Mastering the Complex Sale"" (another must read), and will be diving into Jeff's other book, ""Exceptional Selling""I know for a fact that the information that I garnered from ""Prime Solutions"" will be our differentiating factor from our competition and will put us into the leadership quadrant of IT consulting companies here in our region.Thanks Jeff for a great book!!!!!CheersMichael KeenSr Solutions ArchitectEnteprise Architecture Group"
3,Some good ideas...but....generally not practical,"I got this book for some ideas to help take the cost out of scrapbooking. While there were some good ideas for materials to use around the house, I realized with the page examples they give, you're still going to have to put money into the scrapping tools, papers, etc. So I picked up some good ideas for unique materials, but it's not really gonna help with scrapbooking on a shoestring budget."
4,Cool Idea Book,This has a lot of different ideas on things to use around the house. Some of them I would have never thought to use for scrapbooking. I would say it was a good buy.
4,"Say U.N.C.L.E. ! Open Channel ""U"" for you!","I love the old TV series, and kept buying and watching them on VHS tape.A little corny, yes it is, but at the time a great spy AFFAIR!"
2,Doesn't actually teach anything,"This video doesn't teach you anything about how to dance. For starters every type of dance is broken up into sections that only last 5 minutes or so. Every move is demonstrated for you very quickly and only twice so that if you can't learn a move within the ten seconds that its shown you have to keep rewinding. To make it worse you are only showed the man's steps and the woman is just told to do the opposite. Trust me, just doing the opposite is not that easy. I can't recommend any other videos because I haven't tried them, but if you have no clue how to do any basic moves, as I don't, Do not waste your money on this DVD."
2,Do you want to dance? with Teresa Mason,This dance video is brief viewing of advanced dancing and did not help with learning how to dance. I would not recomend this video. I feel this is money wasted.
3,I would not recommend this video for the beginner dancer,"This video is for people familiar with dance or who learn well by watching. The instruction is through demonstration without explaination, so a beginner or novice would not do well by using this video. However, the patterns and ammalgamation sequences are unique, stylish, practical, and effective to those with a working knowledge of the dance being demonstrated."
1,Too Spiritual,More spiritual than I would want. I am sensitive to spirituality in books since it is so dependant on the individual.
5,A book for adventurers in body or spirit,"Smitten by South Georgia after 20+ years of sailing the world in a 28' cutter, the Carrs have generously chosen to share the object of their affection through breathtaking photographs and charming text. The reader accompanies them as they explore the coastal bays, ski across glaciers, and wonder at being preened by an albatross. Holding this book in your hands is a reminder of the truth of the definition of work as ""love made visible."""
4,Book review,"Very informative book about a company that was in the same town I lived in later in the century. As a ""vintage glass"" collector, it was also USEFUL/VALUABLE to me in my information quest. FAST shipping, too, made this a POSITIVE transaction. Thanks!!!"
4,Phat Global #1,"a great compilation! I already knew the best 2 songs of the album: Marseillais du Nord by Cheb Mami and Clandestino by Manu Chao. The spectrum ranges from English-Asian big beat, Indish Bollywood Electronica, Latin music from Spain and France to African music. This is ""MUSIC"" - how you maybe have not experienced it. Also recommended: the compilation ""Fuerza!"""
4,All around good...,Kudos on inclusion of the up and coming latin artists doing new beats with their music... I really love this compilation... It takes me on a musical trip through my mind...
1,Never waste,"You shouldn't waste your money and time reading this series.I read the books in Japanese for years.The first few volumes are okay, but the story and the characters will get messed up later on.Better not expect a lot from this series and the author."
1,Longstanding hope and bloody treachery,"The story of this novel was fertile long ago, but now it became worthless deblis...The auther, Kurimoto said this novel was heroic fantasy, however she changed her mind and many aspects.Heroes and heroines were gone. Only selfish and egoistic wreckage of characters stayed behind.Fatal prophecy was forgot. Old covenanter was ignored. ""Heroic fantasy? I've never written like that"", Kurimoto said.Kurimoto destroyed essential component of Guin Saga.Please imagine if Anakin Skywalker do not became Darth Vader and has a homosexual encounter with Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars episode III. Do you want to see that in authentic history of Star Wars?Guin Saga turned to slash novel. Kurimoto's bizzare sexial fantasy is nightmare of many readers in Japan."
5,Guin's search for his identity and destiny,"The Guin Saga Book One: The Leopard Mask By Kaoru Kurimoto is a disturbing and dramatic fantasy of a deadly war between ancient kingdoms. The only surviving royalty of the losing kingdom are rescued by a creature with a man's body and a leopard's head, a being who remembers nothing of his past except for his name - Guin. It is Guin's search for his identity and destiny that leads to an exciting political intrigue and an evolving, exhilarating journey of discovery."
4,A good start,"I've read the first book and it's really moving along well. I found it very readable, and a good revitalization of the Japanese, which was pretty dated. The first five books in the series form a complete story, and I have a feeling that is all they will translate. Hopefully they can avoid the problems later on in the series that way!"
5,An amazing tale,"Having read the first through third books in English, I'm completely hooked on this incredible fantasy series. Imaginative and inventive, they're 100% worth your time (not that these books take long to read). The mysteries introduced in this first book carry though the following installations, keeping the story multi-layered as the chararacters continue their journey. Definitely recommend for anyone with the slightest interest in fantasy literature. Would love to see more of the books published in English."
3,"Not bad, cartoonish, reminds me of ER Burroughs","This started like a few other items I've read recently, with a hero who'd lost his memory, so I thought it was a recent trend. It was a surprise to read here that it first appeared in 1979, and that there are over 80 books to the series. It does read like a cartoon epic, with not much depth to the archetypal characters. However it was a pleasant way to while away an afternoon, and somewhat fun to see old Tolkien characters reapper (a wraith of all things). More than anything else it reminded me of Edgar Rice Burroughs Princess of Mars series that I read as a kid, with the stress on bigger than life warriors, an enfeebled civilization, barbarian tribes, etc."
4,Entertaining,"i like reading the thoughts of both hero and heroine, i wish more stories were written this way. i hated Anne Paget's selfish family, best of all Ms. Basso's sensual writing is both romantic and sexy."
3,well worth watching,This is an entertaining film to say the least.Jason Miller isgreat in his role as a detective trying to hide from his past.The story unfolds with a complicated murder plot and builds fromthere.The ending is very pleasing.
3,Low budget thriller.,"This is a low budget thriller from the director of some of Adam Sandler's funnier films. Even though they spelled my name wrong in the credits and made me BUY my own copy of the movie, I must say it pulled together nicely!"
2,UNEVEN...Late nighter at best,"I saw this at a friend's house and was amazed how why anyone would rent it. It wasn't bad enough to be enjoyable as a joke and definitely not good enough to be enjoyable as a movie. It was just plain uneven. He was awful. The lead girl wasn't bad, especially given that she acted against the lead male. Jason Miller, who I am told was the priest in the Exorcist, is really terrific. I wish he had done some more movies of value. And the bad guys were pretty good, especially the lead bad guy who made me feel bad for him, very intense, and may have been the best actor in the film. IT's a late night, nothing to do film at best."
1,The Infinite Wonders of Creation is not one of them,"Both musically and creatively Luca Turilli is, in this disc, under himself. The trilogy project started well, Prophet of the Last Eclipse meaned an incredible quality jump, and logically the waited punch line created great expectation. But then, The Infinite Wonders of Creation happens. And what a disappoint. The sound here is totally different in a bad way, likewise the style. What we love in the previous albums --brilliant passages, emotive choral segments, interesting themes and stories, the fast and furious drums, among many other things-- is now disappeared. Definitly the trilogy is not well closed; Turilli is in debt with his exquisite work. The Infinite Wonders of Creation is not one of them."
2,$200??? This thing is barely worth $20!,"First of all, I have no idea how they can get away with charging $230...I bought this same model at Bed Bath & Beyond for $50, and I ended up returning it. I loved the concept of a remote control lamp with a dimmer, and preferred incandescent to halogen for safety reasons, but this thing just didn't cut it. For starters, it wouldn't work with the outlet that's operated by a wall switch - I could turn it off with the switch but not on...I have no idea why since my other lamp works just fine with it. Next, my biggest criticism: when you dim the light the lamp produces a very annoying high-pitched buzz, kind of like what you'd get with an old computer hard drive...unbelievably irritating. And finally, the quality of light from two 150W incandescent bulbs is still far inferior to a 300W halogen. I never even got around to trying the remote control, since there's no way the benefit it adds could make up for these shortcomings. Don't waste your time."
1,Not Worth It,"I haven't even bought this book, but my advice would be to skip it. I came to this site looking for a supplement to the ETS guide. There are too many misspelled words in the description for me to feel like this would be an adequate test guide. If you can't be bothered to clear up typos in the description, what on earth is the text going to be like?I have downloaded the ETS guide, which is about $23. For supplementary material, I'm going back over material in textbooks."
5,Great for small animals,"Bought this cage for my sugar glider as a travel cage. We needed a cage on short notice that isn't too expensive and can be folded flat and be set up within minutes. I also have 2 chihuahuas but I don't know if it'd work as good for them. There's definitely enough room to transport small dogs but the only door to get in the cage is on the top. It's also a bit hard to snap the sides of the cage into place when setting up the cage but other than that it's sturdy, roomy, and really good quality considering it's quite cheap compared to other products."
4,Secrets Can Kill,"If you enjoy puzzles, and like mysteries, this game is for you. When played correctly, this game will stretch your thinking skills.If you have played other Nancy Drew games, remember this one was the first. Every time a new ND game is released there are improvements, but this one is still good.I orginally bought this game for my son's 10th B-day. I ended up playing it too. Now I'm hooked and keep coming back for more. The puzzles are challenging, and the setting interesting. We now own 17 of the 19 games released.For those of you who have played some of the later games, you might want to back up and play this one so you can see how things have changed, and so you can say you have played them all. But beware there are a lot of ""clues"" in this one that don't really lead you anywhere. They are just there for the fun of solving them (or they go to motive). Be careful and don't miss the real clues.Nancy Drew fans will not want to miss this one."
4,The One that Started it All,"This game may be older & not quite as sophisticated as the newer titles, but it is challenging and very cute. If you collect the Nancy Drew series, Secrets Can Kill is a must have before the game becomes too old to play. Great for pre-teens and a refreshing break from ordinary shooting games."
2,Don't judge the other games by this one!!!!!,"This game was not nearly as good in graphics, or plot, so if you have played only this one, all the other Nancy drew games are WAY better and please don;t think that all the rest are like this. I don't mean this review in any offense to HER (herinteractive) but this was their first game and they improved alot even between even the 1st two games."
1,Dont Buy This,"Notice this one was made by Dreamcatcher (sorry Dreamcatcher) the good ones are made by Her Interactive. Im sorry I bought this, it had unenjoyable tedious clues, artistically amateur renderings of characters (the environment art was ok) but a waste of money."
1,horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I totaly agree with you.My friend has this game and I HATE IT.I hated having to have 2 discs.What sucked was that if you wanted to be at the college you have a disc and if you want to go to the library or the dinner you insert another disc.Dont buy this because I am afraid that after 30 minutes your going to want to comite suicide!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,"very moving, touching story with memorable characters","I did not want this book to end! I felt I was there with them, wanting these people to succeed, witnessing miracles happen even if they were small. I felt like I knew George and Clara, understood them and would've liked to have known them. I will not look at older folks the same way again. I am passing this wonderful book around to all my friends and hope they too will see what we all take for granted. I cried as I finished this book (not a normal reaction for me) because it was ending, happy for the survivors and missing the ones gone on around."
5,WONDERFUL!,"This is, quite simply, a wonderful book....full of heart, love and soul! What more could a reader ask? A must read for anyone who loves good literature."
5,A touching different kind of love story. Laugh out loud fun!,"I was afraid I wasn't going to like this book but after about 50 pages, I couldn't put it down. The book speaks of love of nature and others. I found myself laughing out loud on a plane and wanting to tell all to read this book."
5,Bravo! A spirited struggle to save dignity in aging.,"Gregg Kleiner in his first novel depicts a spirited struggle to maintain diginity in aging. He creates a world where rich characters work to keep their spirits alive, often taking on traits of the animal kingdom (the skunk women, the rhino, and others). A world where inanimate objects carry personae, cars, candles and lawn chairs have spiritual qualities. But mostly it is about a group of aging people who want to be alive, when the conventional path would place them sedated in a nursing home. A wild journey, and a must read"
5,Absolutely one of the best books I have ever read ! ! ! !,"This book is incredible - I laughed, I cried and will continue to think about this story and it's characters for a long time. Mr. Kleiner should be busy writing more novels - he has a genuine talent for making his characters come alive. I hated to see this wonderful book come to an end. If only more people would think like the people in this story about life, old age and death, society would be a lot better off. An incredible story about unforgettable people who came alive off the pages. This truly is one of the best books I have ever read and that is really saying something! This portrays the circle of life better than any other book out there! This is a very deep and sensitive book - one to not be forgotten!"
3,Served its purpose,"Simple, but elegant. And also a lot of tulle. I would say a little too much for such a short veil. None-the-less I wore it for the wedding, but took it off for the majority of my pictures."
5,Cutting My Kilt,"This has got to be one of my all time favorite cds. I've loved every song on the album and it keeps my spirits up, ironically. Their morbid lyrics and sadistic sensualism runs right through me. I love this cd! I need to get a new one because my current one skips. *pouts* I also need to order their newest one. I haven't found it at any stores so my best bet is, of course, AMAZON. If anyone enjoys my views, email me. mylescoty@hotmail.com I really want to get intouch with people from Montana; my gf and I are moving there within the next 2-6 months. We're in WI, now."
3,Weak,"i have to say, That Jack off Jill's most recent CD, ""Clear Hearts, Grey Flowers"" overthrows this by a mile. In this, jack off jill lost their tough chick role, by producing weak songs, in which many sound alike. Some good songs would be ""Lollirot"" ""My Cat"" ""super sadist"" and ""girlscout"". The weak songs are ""american Made"" ""Horrible"" can speak for itself and ""Devil With A Black Dress Om"" i do reccomend the CD, but u wont be as impressed"
1,Please enter a title for your review,"I can't work out what this band is trying to do. There are elements of metal, punk, riot grrl, and grunge, all of which are handled in the most rudimentary way. If music is inconsequential to you and all you're looking for is a cute unconventional singer to worship, then Jack Off Jill may be the band for you. If you're looking for good tunes you won't find them here."
3,I love the group.....,"I love Jack Off Jill. I have to say that much, but this is the only album I OWN! I have currently ordered ""Clear Hearts, Gray Flowers"" and ""Covetous Creature"". I don't feel right in reviewing something until I actually have the CD accessible for me to listen to. In this case, I only have this album.First things first. The album is solid, the music is good, and her vocal's are full of pent up rage as always. Those are the good points.The bad ones....I found the songs uninspiring, and rather bland. It doesn't seem that they put their all into this album.Once I get the other albums, I will review those, because I know ""Clear Hearts, Grey Flowers"" is an amazing album in itsself."
1,"Instead of this, I reccomend the latest by Android Lust","On one level, I pity all the folks who think this is good music... It is neither creative nor innovative, only cliched and juvenile. This album sounds like something I would have written in high school. Not that high schoolers suck at writing...on the contrary, high school kids can be quite gifted, and these ladies are obviously not teenagers! On the other hand, and on another level, I can see how most people would like this crap. The general public has a limited idea of what good music and writing are...I am reserving judgement on Scarling, the singer's new band, until I hear it, because I am willing to bet that Jessicka has matured as a songwriter and musician... At least she should have by now.... it's been at least 4 years... For some really moving music, check out some Shostakovich string quartets, PLEASE! America needs more educated and cultured people."
2,Effective & Practical ???,"This book will not teach you how to defend yourself. I am not street fighter, but I have some experience. And I know that the material presented by Dr. Yang will not work on the streets. However, there are some interesting information contained in this book - mainly about psychology of attacker. But - again - as a self defence book... NO!"
2,The Old Bait and Switch.,"This book looks and sounds like practicle self defense for everyone using kung fu, but it's really a more traditional kung fu self defense approach. The picture on the cover is nowhere in the book. In fact, there are no pictures in the book that show everyday people in street clothes. Their all martial artist in traditional dress. I was very disappointed in this book. If you have a background in martial arts, you might like the book better."
4,Good SVHS tape,Bought four as replacement for four purchased in 2000. Can't believed they lasted so long.
1,JVC,"Was very disappointed with this tape. Initially it played extremely well, but after only a few recordings, it started giving me more problems than much less expensive tapes. Thought paying more would mean better quality, but no. Would like to return the ones not used."
3,Interesting ?,An interesting book with some thoughful insights. However the author goes totally off the tract in many areas. When looking for information about the Alamo I am not really interested in the author's upbringing and introduction to racism. While an important part of consideration in any research the author seems too focussed on this point. An index would have been useful to relate to and check interacting points of thought. To me - interesting but more of one man's personal research journey then a great read.
2,"Don't Bother, Just a Rehash","I was looking forward to reading this book, and it turned out to be most disappointing. It's nothing more than a collection and rehash of the same bias. It pretends to be objective, but is not. There's nothing new here. I give it two stars because one, the author actually got it published, and two, the author kept it short. Should you decide to read this book like I did, it's very likely you already know all of the stuff written here."
3,Alamo - Crockett and other mysteries,"A very good book from a history standpoint. Provides a great source of information. Presents several alternative views and options of historical situations during the Texas revolution. Includes some very interesting facts that are not well known by most Americans. Although wonderful and entertaining most of the time, unfortunately it is also includes some slow and dry reading, reducing my overall rating. I would give it a 3.5 if I could, but not a 4."
4,Some Memorable Songs,"I bought the CD two months ago and it is nearly always in my CD player. There are some really great songs on this, such as Style, The Goldfarb Variations, Up To His Old Tricks that play through my mind all day but there are also some songs that I didn't like very much such as Lion Tamer and I just got bored with Charmin's Lament.I was also a bit disappointed with the inlay. I had hoped it would have some pictures but it didn't."
4,Very Good,"Althought this is a great recording, it doesn't exactly live up to Schwartz classics like Pippin or Godspell. Like many, it takes a few listenings for it to grow on you. For example, I hated 'Solid Silver Platform Shoes' the first time I heard it. It is now one of my favorites. The Only songs I like on this are 'Solid Silver Platform Shoes','Style','Two's Company','The Goldfarb Variations', and 'West End Avenue'. The others are, well, pretty bad. It is still very much worth buying."
3,"Nice build quality, shame about the zoom...","Although the build quality is excellent, when used with my DSC-P200 there is a keyhole effect until the camera is set to around 2x zoom or above. This is a real disappointment as I had hoped for the zoom to be multiplied over the whole range. Despite this it works well at the higher zoom levels, though on reflection I should have bought a digital SLR and kept the P200 for what it is really intended - point and shoot..."
2,Limited use,"I was disappointed with this lens because of its limitations. You can only use it with your camera FULLY zoomed. Otherwise, the image is within a small circle with the outside blacked out. I thought I would have more of a range. Shaking is also very noticeable, though, of course, that is to be expected when a camera has no image stabilization. The adapter needed for attaching the lens is also a bit clunky."
2,Less than helpful,"Loving my Sony digital P200 camera, I could hardly wait to get the Telephoto Conversion Lens and adapter to hold it to the camera. Either I am seriously impaired, or something is wrong. It is unwieldy to attach, time consuming, and when the telephoto lens is attached, you cannot use the camera in any other picture taking mode. It must be fully utilized distance wise, any closer and you get a black area in the circle. While it makes objects/scenes closer, it is not particularly close up on the distant shots. I was disappointed and feel I wasted my money. Explore some more reviews before purchasing."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS,don't buy it! It needs a converter and then it has this small circle that is the zoom option. Buy a camera that already features a zoom such as a 15 x.
1,No adapter available,"Beware when buying this lens. Sony told me they had the adapter needed to attach it to the W5 camera. I ordered it from them, and the lens from Amazon because Amazon is not shipping the adapter at this time. Guess what-Sony now says it does not have the adapters and will not have any in the furute. They credited my money back and said Sorry. I now have a camera and a telephoto lens with no way to connect the two items. Not Amazons fault. Just don't trust Sony."
4,Nice Addition,The telephoto lens adds a Great feature to the DSC W1. The pictures are VERY sharp and clean without any fringe wash out and or distortions. It is quick to mount and with the adapteris not cumberson and does not off weight the unit like the large 35mm units tend to do. A nice feature of the adapteris it opens a myriad of add on filters and lens options for the camera. If you have a need for a telephoto look no further espically for the sports/ nature events. This is one option wellworth the price.
1,Piece of junk,"This is a cheap piece of junk custom. The picture is very deceiving. The worst part id the wig which is nothing more than a ball of rat hair. My kid was so upset because he wanted to be Shaggy. Needless to say we're off to the custom store to re-buy a new custom. Don't but this, you will regret it."
2,No arch support at all,"If you are flat footed, these sandals will be very soft and comfy. You'll like them. I, however, have high arches and need the arch supports. The description said the Sandy sandals have them so I bought a pair. However, they have absolutely no arch, just a slight heel. The Ginger and Mallory sandals both have nice arch supports that are comfy. I would recommend those.So in short, don't buy if you're expecting arch support."
2,What A Waste Of Awesome Animation!!,The story was just a little slow through episode 1 but it did end with the Techo (robot) emerging and it was cool so I continued to watch. However the story just didnt move. The character development was too slow. The animation however was top notch and a style that I love. The opening (and preview I saw) made this show look fun and entertaining but Volume 1 was such a downer. It is possible to be fun and serious. Maybe Im giving up too early but I need more than a pretty face.
4,Most useful,"Works well with UK, US and International plugs. Feels solid too.I have been using one in Guinea for a month or more and am just ordering a few more ..."
2,Advertising unclear,"While this is probably a good product, it is good only in Great Britain, not Germany, not France, not Israel. The British plug requires an adapter for other countries and it's not clear how many amps the adapter will have to handle. Be warned! If you are ordering for GB, you'd probably be satisfied and give it 5 stars. And what's with the lousy packing...box 20 times the size of the strip and tape almost falling off. Take a star away."
4,USED BUT JUST AS DESCRIBED!!!,"A little slow getting here, but other than that, just as described!!!!"
3,Good Game,"The game can get a little stale if you can't hang out long enough to get codes ""after hours"". Overall, not bad at all!"
5,This is a really great series from MadHouse,"I got the entire series now. This is a great series, very stylized and very engrossing with the imagery and music. Another great production from Mad House."
3,"Cool Knife Block, OK Knives","I got this as a gift.I really like how it looks.I only have two small comments about it:1.) It is taller than you think.2.) The knives are not really dishwasher safe.I have rust spots on mine. They cut just fine, but aren't that pretty anymore. I could polish them I guess. Just my two cents."
2,cheap plastic holder,"The knives look OK but the holder is light and will easily get scratched and will loose its paint right away, it will be fun to look at but not a quality product you can use in a busy kitchen."
5,This album will make Salsa music a favorite of yours too!,Having only limited exposure to Latin music I cant beleive my luck in stumbling on this CD! I dare anyone to try to sit still as they listen. I begs to be danced to!
5,The best salsa album of the last two years! viva dura!!,They were the toast of England on their recent tour. There is no better dance music anywhere.
3,A little disappointing.,"I was a little disappointed with this book, mainly because it was published in the 80's and the lists are those used in the 80's, and not current for today (2003)."
2,"Complete, but not reliable","Don't assume that a name from this book is genuine Hebrew name and will be familiar in Israel or to a native Hebrew speaker.Thankfully before naming my baby I ran a few names from this book by friends who are Hebrew speakers living in Israel. Some of the names turned out to be not of Hebrew origin at all when the book claimed it to be true (for example, girl's name Luz). Some they told me were my invention (Rafaela for a girl - never heard of in Israel; the book never mentioned that even though of Hebrew origin, this name is not used for girls in Hebrew). Some had the meanings wrong (Adah means ""eternal"", not a variant of Adi meaning adornment as the book claims).So the verdict is, read it for ideas of what you might like, but take it ALL with a big grain of salt."
2,Not last long at all,"Bought these bulbs and 5 months later, one of them burns out. Yes, I wear gloves so my hand oil do not mess with the lens. Not recommended."
3,Belt Clip for Etrex,"This item comes with what is intended to be a spare battery cover. Belt clip works very well and stub screws into the back of the existing battery cover. However, battery cover shipped with this item does not fit Etrex Vista CX since it does not have the proper cutout/indentation to make room for the expansion microchip which is inserted to the side of the batteries with the cover removed. Thus, you are paying for more than is usable."
1,Sprechstimme???,"I have a Boulez recording of the Pierrot Lunaire that I recorded on tape from a friend's Lp in 1979. I don't know anything about this lp, except that it is a Boulez's direction, but I think that it is an earlier version of the 1978 recording. The ""sprechstimme"" is realized better than the De Gaetani recording, obviously better than the '78 Boulez recording (here the reciter sing, and the Pierrot should absolutely not be sung) and much better than the 1997 recording with Christine Schafer, who sing and often seems, I don't know how to say, almost like a ""strangled hen""!... If anybody knows if this recording (my earlier Boulez recording on tape) is available on cd please tell us!!!"
1,is it music?,"What can I say about Schoenberg? It is not music, it is a torture for the ears!Nelson Jose de Camargo Sao Paulo - Brazil"
3,I couldnt review this album,"I could not review this album because it was not avalible to listen to. Had I listen to it I'm sure I would have either liked it or not liked it. I'm sure the album has music on it. This music is probably played by instraments. I'm sure they sound like what their supost to sound like.So in conclution, this album may or may not be the best album I've ever heard!"
1,More Telavista garbage - the usual junk quality homemade DVD-R,"Don't waste your money on these guys' junk. They're a total bootleg outfit, with homemade DVD-Rs 'mastered' from old VHS cassettes and color Xerox artwork. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Wait until the actual rights-holder puts out a legit, remastered, letterboxed release of this title, with supplements, etc. Here, all you're gonna get is...well, read the other reviews and you'll what I mean. I'm not alone in trashing this company's worthless product."
5,A Bible For Hollywood Tourists,"The first time I went to Hollywood, I had this then-new book in my camera bag. If it weren't for this book I would have missed so many interesting spots from Buster's silent comedies. As I tooled up Hollywood Blvd, a street sign for ""Cosmos"" sounded familiar so I took out Bengtson's book and there it was; a picture of the building in front to my left was in the background of a few scenes in ""Cops."" Any silent film buff worth their weight in silver nitrate needs this book before they tour Hollywood!"
3,Almost great.,"This a thoroughly researched and delightful book. Not only did Mr. Bengston find many of the locations, but his analysis of the films is first-rate. Add to this the trivia sprinkled throughout the book (e.g., Jean Arthur making an early screen appearance in Seven Chances.) and you have one of the best books ever on silent films. Unfortunately, the Santa Monica Press' production values let Mr. Bengston down. The major part of the book--the illustrations--are generally too small and lack contrast. As a result, they have poor definition and clarity suffers. Had the book been a bit larger, the paper a little better, and a finer screen used for the illustrations this would have been a five-star review."
5,I hope this gets re-released.....,"After reading and being fascinated by Bengston's Chaplin book (Silent Traces), I really want a brand new copy of the Keaton book. I hope it gets published again. I don't want a used copy for $50. I heard him speak at the Academy last week and he is really interesting."
5,A must have for all Keaton fans and Hollywood historians,"Just as Keaton's character Sherlock Jr. managed to appear in the right place at the right time, author John Bengtson has done just that. He has found many locations of Buster Keaton's most important silent films. Anyone interested in Keaton's work or the history of early filmaking will find this book to be a treasure."
3,Battery Tester,"The extending arm is difficult to pull up, and I am not sure how long it will last. Battery must be placed just right to get a true reading. I think I would look for a different type of tester next time."
3,ok,Works ok but I always test twice (some times it is really off the first test). Also the top is hard to open so I am a bit worried I might break it. Other then that it is a good product.
2,cheap and simple but seems very inconsistent,"At first I liked this battery tester because it was cheap, small and simple but i can test the same battery several times and get vastly different results so I just don't trust the reading."
2,Arrived Broken. Has Flimsy Construction.,"The LCD screen of this tester was broken when it arrived. Also I noticed that the battery cover did not close securely. Overall it has a poor quality construction. So I had to return it.Never got a chance to use it so cannot say how accurate it is.I eventually bought the ZTS Mini Battery Tester instead. More expensive, but didn't want to go with something of poor quality again."
4,Sinometer Digital Battery Tester,"I love it! I had batteries in every drawer, nook and crevice throughout the house. I was able to test them all and separate the bad from the good. It did take a little getting use to, but once I had my technique down it went rather quickly. Thank you"
4,Compact and Accurate Battery Tester,"I've only used this tester a few times but so far it appears to be all that I had hoped for. It has a nice, small form factor, yet is capable of testing just about any battery you can throw at it. The only con that I have about it is the pull out top is sticky to move in and out. Not a big deal but would be nicer if it worked a little smoother. I didn't take off a star for that, I just don't give five stars for an item unless I find it to be truly exceptional."
2,"cheap, cheesy, flimsy",When you pull out the stem holding the top sensor be very gentle. It's brittle & weak and sticky going up. Same goes for when you need to guide it back down to make contact with the positive battery end. Once in operation it's cool how the digital bars rise to give an accurate reading. Just not convenient to use and certainly not durable.
4,Works good for cheapie,"Received on time and in good condition. Batteries wouldn't make good contact and I would get an intermittant readings sometimes, cleaned the tester's contacts and now it works great for the price."
5,Great Battery tester but a little fragile,Great unit but the main arm that slides to adjust to different batteries is very fragile and could break if heavey handed.Works perfect and has a high resolution LCD gauge that is extremely accurate.a++++
5,Great product,This little tester is great. It does take a battery for it to work and it works well. Glad I bought it.
2,mastech digital battery tester,"I was very disappointed in this item, especially that it needed a battery in it to work. Having a small box full of batteries to test, many in their original packaging, I truely question the accuracy of the item as many of them did not register. Our first battery tester that was bought from a Walter Drake catalog and for less money (but was lost), was better."
3,"Nowhere title, funny story...","Narue is a schoolgirl who happens to be an alien. Normal enough for a manga really. She has to face androids, alien invasion and her first date. The end result is a manga you feel you have red before. Many, many times.Get it used or, if you are NEW to manga, get it new. A mixture of science fiction, comedy and action."
2,"Disappointing.....rain is fine, music OK, scenes stagnant!","We own the Waterfalls DVD and often play it as background when we have people over. Scenery is spectacular and scenes change often.The rain sounds on this DVD are good....not great. The difference between light rain, heavy rain and monsoon rain wasn't different enough for us to enjoy. It was OK.The music is soft and soothing, but just OK.The real bummer was the scenery. Scenes would be stagnant for some 3-4 minutes at a time. I guess we were comparing it to the Waterfalls DVD. No comparison. For example, one scene is just raindrops falling into a lake. But you don't see anything but the water....for like 5 complete minutes....I am assuming it was a lake....no zooming in and out.....just filming water on a tripod, I guess.If that is your ""thing"", great! You will like the DVD. But for us, we were looking for more scenery selections. After all, it is a DVD to listen and WATCH!!....and not a music CD."
5,So Relaxing...,"This is my favorite DVD. It's so relaxing...I live alone and I don't watch TV so it gets pretty quiet in my apartment. This Rain DVD is the perfect background noise, beautiful scenery and relaxing sounds of rain. I haven't been able to find any other DVD like it. Most ambient DVDs are of fire, waterfalls, or beaches. I searched a long time for a ambient Rain DVD and here it is! If you love rain, I highly recommend it. <3"
2,NO Thunder,Very vibrant colored scenery that looks like it has been rained on and then the sound of rain was added. This didn't do it for me. I am very disappointed.
5,Works well,"Works well, easy installation, competitive price. No regrets (Can't say that I miss the sensation of having the rear hatch window falling on my head which happened frequently before these replacements arrived.)"
5,Great!!,"Does what it says, easy to install and works perfect on my Rodeo 99. Can't go wrong with this purchase."
2,No too much!,"The product was not very complete as expected. It's a little boring...I'm sorry, but I'm honest...It's probably good for begining student...Thank!"
2,"Technique may be good, but over-simplistic","While the learning technique of endless repetition of words and phrases may be good, the practice of it becomes endlessly boring, especially when one is trying to teach others. With very little grammar and vocabulary in this program, you end up with a thorough knowledge of a very few basic phrases."
4,Good deal,I ordered this book in good condition. It has exceeded my expectations. I has been used but only slightly. The corners were a little rounded but its the type of book that will get a lot of use from me becuase of the charts and graphs.
1,Great format - lack of primary source research,"What potentially is an extremely valuable tool has the fatal flaw of not utilizing primary source information. Information included is what someone with one theological bias says about someone else with another theological position. Especially distressful is the representation of Catholic theology and Armenian positions. Obviously written with ""theological glasses"" that are not ""clear"". Does, however, contain much valuable information for those who can objectively secure primary source information to verify statements."
1,NOT a boxed set,"Be careful of what you are buying here. This is NOT a boxed set. It is simply Black Cat video #1 with an empty box to store the other videos in when you purchase them. There is NOTHING else included, so essentially you are paying an extra nine bucks JUST FOR A BOX!!"
4,Good first watch,"We bought this for our daughter when she turned 5. It is easy to put on and durable. She likes it. We love the analog display so she can really learn to tell time.Overall, it is a good value."
3,gee-gee's review,"i purchased this cd in 1996,slave didn't disappoint me.you take my breath away,and slide remake is a must to hear! if you are a true slave fan purchase this cd today!"
1,jazz pants,"not what I expected. just a long exercise pant, there is no definition. not what I consider a purpose built jazz pants."
4,a poet in his prose,"No biography of Eliot could better capture the thoughts and personality of the young poet than these letters. Eliot had a lively correspondence with so many, including family, friends, editors, and partners in verse. Even the short letters -- like the ones in which Eliot simply announces to his correspondent that he's exhausted and doesn't want to write anything -- give a glimpse of how Old Possum acted.Eliot's poetry is so cerebral and allusive that when reading it, one can feel at his mercy. In his letters he is far less in control, and the contrast is fascinating."
4,A Little Crumbly,"These have a great taste, though do not hold together all that well. About half of mine were crumbs when I opened them. Tasty though!"
5,Amerock Allison Chrome Pulls,"The ""Amerock Allison 174CH Metal Finishes Pull, Traditional Footed, Polished Chrome"" added a beautiful finishing touch to my newly ""chromed-out"" master bathroom. The style has the updated feel I was going for."
2,Two Outta Three Ain't Bad,"I OWN ALL 3 VOLUMES. This one is the worst. Volume One is 5 stars and my favorite album. Volume 3 is 4 stars and very good with Lazy Lester and Cephas and Wiggins. Unfortunately this one has some incredibly bad tracks, starting with the first one which is truly awful. Combine that with Annie Raines' vocals which are utterly horrendous and you have about one album of decent blues harp but certainly not two. Buy volume 1, it's fantastic."
1,too small for accessories,"Bought for P100 and was disappointed. Even the main compartment will not hold the battery charger. The two front compartments are too small be of any practical value. For a digital camera you need space for camera, memory stick case, battery charger, connectors to computer and TV and room for the manual would be nice."
2,nice but theres better,i have the cybershotdsc-p200. i bought this case first but was unsatified with the loose fit of the camera. i then purchased the sony semi-soft case and liked that one much better. no room for the camera to move around or scratch the screen. the downside is nothing but the camera fits in the case so i decided to keep them bot since the other one was only $13.
3,fine,I bought it for Sony Cybershot HX7V - the camera is much smaller then the case. it needs another case.
2,"Not that great, but it's the only one that works","The inside of the bag is padded very, very little, so it's basically like carrying your camera around in piece of nylon. The DSC-H20 is not snug inside this bag, there's a lot of room for it to slide around.Yet the storage compartments can't fit anything but a battery and a memory card, it definitely can't fit even the smaller chargers. One thing you could do is put the charger in the main compartment with the camera, but then you'd have two pieces of plastic banging around in there with every step you took.This is just a poorly designed, highly (HIGHLY) overpriced bag. Stick with the small, rectangular case if your camera fits in it, which some of the bulkier/longer Sony's don't."
2,Fine for camera only,"This camera case is absolutely fine if you intend to carry your camera and none of its accessories. The camera has a rechargeable battery, therefore it has a recharger. This case does not have space for the charger. This camera has a single cable, approximately four feet long, used to download pix to computer and/or to connect camera to TV. The case will not accommodate the camera and the cable. If you want to carry your camera and two fingernail clippers, no problem, this is the case for you. If you want to carry your camera, charger, cable and maybe the instructions to your camera ... you are out of luck."
3,works but shotty,"its a little loose for my DSC-90 and thin...very little padding.I would go to the store and bring your camera to test different choices...ALSO, SONY should keep in mind the accesories that come with these cameras when they devise the storage compartments on their cases...WOULDNT that make sense?"
3,sony lcs-csd general carrying case,Little small. Good for day walks. Can't hold all things needed. Cute bag.
2,NOT for the SONY W1 Digital Camera,"This case is too Big for the W1 camera. The camera keeps on moving inside the case. I dunno why it is advertized for the W1 model!!!! I think if you have TWO (or maybe 3) W1 cameras, this case will be a good choice ;) I guess this case was intended for ealier and bigger sony cameras.I gave this case 2/5 because it is actually a nice case (for other sony models), it can fit all ur extra batteries & memory sticks and it is made of good materials."
3,Too big for DSC-S90,Case is good quality and the price was good. But my DSC-S90 bounces around inside way too much.
3,"Good case, but...","I found this to be a great case.Just not for my Sony DSC-200! I'm actually using it for my JVC Everio, which fits snugly with the (included) battery attached. I can also keep my memory sticks for my Sony in the little pockets. (I carry the still camera in a pocket for now.) I just wish there was a tiny bit more room for a spare battery for the Everio. Isn't it weird how hard it is to find a good case for any camera? They all seem to be missing a little something, or be just a little too big or a little too small."
4,Very nice camera bag !,"Well made and compact, but it needs a compartment for the small wall charger?A second battery as a back up solves the problem."
4,"Nice case, well priced",I have a sony dsc-h3 and there aren't many cases to fit it.This one is priced well & protects my camera nicely.
2,Sony case,The fit is fine but it lacks protective padding like many after market cases. It offers minumal protection compared to other brands.
5,Not Too Big For DSC-S90,I have a DSC-S90 and I felt it was the perfect size. It is well made and has all the extra storage pockets I need. Sony did a great job designing this case.
4,Good little case,"I purchased this carrying case for a Sony DSC-V3 digital camera. Like another reviewer stated, this case fits this camera perfectly. Although if you do have the strap on the camera itself, fitting the camera with the strap in the case is a bit of a squeeze. It also has a small zipperd pocket in the front, where you can either fit an extra memory card or the USB cable, etc. Great for travel where you don't want to log around a large case.Overall, if you're looking for a small case to protect your camera, along with one or two small accessories (e.g. extra memory card), then this is a good one - especially at a great price. But if you have a bigger camera than the Sony DSC-V3 (Dimensions from Sony site: 4 3⁄4"" x 2 7⁄8"" x 2 1⁄12"" (119.8 x 72 x 63mm)) then this case is not it."
3,Fairly Large Case,"This case is suggested for many different cameras. I was looking for a case for my DSC-N2 that would hold more than JUST the camera. I sliped mine into this case and I could have fit maybe two more. It was bigger than I could possibly use. I ended up buying a Lowepro. On their site they have a PDF chart to tell which cameras will fit which cases. They were right on. I bought the Lowepro Ridge 10 and I fit my camera in the main zipper section, an extra battery in the front velcro section, and there is room for an extra card in the front zipper section. They come with a strap or you can put it on a belt. They are quality and I highly recommend them over what Sony had to offer. They have a big variety of sizes, styles and colors. Good luck!"
3,small and good looking.. but doesn't have space for accessories,"This case is good for my Cybershot P100 camera. However, this doesn't have space for accessories. so you can sure carry your camera and memory stick. But that's it. You can't really fit the cables etc. in this case. Not a bad deal for price.. but only if you don't have to carry your usb cables / chargers etc. with the camera."
2,Sony Camera Case Review,"The case is fine, but the shoulder strap is thin and short. For that reason I don't use the strap, and the case is somewhat inconvenient to carry."
2,Bad,the product is great but the shipping time is horrible. took way longer than the delivery estimate. so if u have the time order it
1,Does not fit my camera!,Received this item for my sony cybershot camera and it doesn't fit. To send it back is more work than anything and with a 20% restocking fee and postage it's not worth it.... Would NOT recommend this vendor!
4,bueno,"es bonito pero me parece que no esta bien diseñado el interior y los bolsillos, ya q no hay espacio para los cables ni el cargador de la bateria, siendo el bolso mas grande que las camaras cybershot"
4,"Got what I wanted,","This case is made for mid sized dig cameras. Well made. I have my Fijifilm V-10 mini camera in a leather case, USB cable, 1 xD card stored in it and I can fit maybe 3 more memory cards and a spare battery in and thats all.I read the reviews very closly and was not suprised. A good buy."
5,Great Carrying Case,"I carried this case all over Europe. It was great! Large enough to hold the camera, zoom lens, extra batteries and extra memory card. Love it!"
3,Camera Case,"While the case is very insulated against shock, should it be dropped, I would have liked a bit more storage for the camera connecting cables. There are plenty of pockets for a spare battery and memory card."
5,Holds everything I need and more.,"What can you say, it's a carrying case for your camera. It's a little large for my DSC-W290, but it still works well. The case is padded and has several compartments for all your extras like batteries, memory cards, cords, etc. I would recommend this product to my friends."
4,nice lttle case,"i have a sony h20 and this bag fits the bill..i bought a neoprene tight fitting bag for the h20, this allows me to put the charger in the same compartment as the camera...and the extra battery can fit in the front pocket along with a memory card or two, this frees up enough space for the bag strap to fit in as well..however i have not found a way to get the usb/component cable in the bag,even if i remove the bag strap.....the bag is well made and i expect it to hold up the the abuse i will put it through... it has a nice belt loop and a couple spots you can hook a carabiner to..best 11.00 bucks your going to spend on your camera"
4,Okay for the price,"I bought this mainly due to the price. Yes, I can be cheap. The camera that goes with it is spendy, for me. (Beyond my computer, the most money I've ever spent on one thing!)The straps are a little weird, and I'm not really sure how to connect them, but it is a spacious little pack for your camera (almost too large for my W55) and whatever else you may need to carry."
5,Works,Great case. It does what it's supposed to and it looks great. I put my Sony Cyber Shot it it and used it for a few other slightly bigger cameras.
3,It didn't fit,It was for a smaller camera than mine so I sent it back so I guess I can't rate it but I didn't hate it.
3,Sony Camera Bag,This bag is way too big for the slim cameras advertised. Unless you have alot of extra gear go with something smaller.
3,Good and beautiful but very large.,This case is good and beautiful but is very large to a Sony W30 or even a Sony W1.
5,Excellent case,"I bought this case along a Cybershot DSC-S90 and it fits in it safely, and the pockets are great for storing memory and extra batteries. I don't agree with the fellows that complained that when you opened it the camera could fall off. Like all electronic and/or expensive device, you just have to be careful when you handle them."
1,sony camera case,When I bought the camera ($500.00 Sony DSC H5) this case was suggested as an appropriately sized accessory. I bought it and it was much too small. I cannot in the future trust the suggestions that come up after buying an expensive item. Word to the wise....research individually everything you buy to make sure it suits your needs.
1,NOT THE CASE FOR DSC-H50,"When I ordered this the description said it was compatible with the DSC-H50. It does not come close, and now when I went back the description had changed."
5,Rotatrim RC RCM18 Cutter,Very well made. Cuts 10 mil laminate. This is the third Rotatrim that we have purchased and they are used heavily in our office. Very reliable.
3,"Rotatrim RC RCM18 18"" cut Rotatrim Professional","This Rotatrim support up to 3mm tickness and it works great when I use one sheet of photo paper. But when I use less than 3mm thick multiple papers with regular copy paper, the brade won't cut and it slide up to on the board and stuck. I couldn't move down to original position easily. I think this is good for cut piece by piece, not for cut multiful papers. I've return this Rotatrim and got full refund money without my shipping cost."
4,Excellent cutter,"After going through a number of cheaper cutters (Fiskar and other brands, which were inconsistent in their cuts and whose alignment always started to go within a matter of months, I finally broke down and bought this cutter. I needed something heavy duty that would cut photographs straight and had great alignment. I am impressed with its build and so far it has been great. My only complaint is that photos can be easily scratched as the space between the plastic lip and the base is very tight. --Lara, [...]"
1,camera,this camera was not what i expected it to be. very disappointed. not enought features. not something i will invest in.
3,fighting for the runner up,"not the worst fighting game, yet not the worst. this may very well be the maxim of the king of fighters. the game has mediocre characters and decent move sets, but nothing much more. if you like fighting games i suppose this is worth it, however make sure you pick up marvel vs capcom and pretty much all the others first."
5,Good resource,This is a good resource when researching the Judean culture at the time of Jesus' birth. It was specifically purchased for use in a sermon but is also an excellent addition to the pastor's resource library.
4,time-saving and delicious,"Planning and cooking dinner has always been enjoyable for me.When I took a new, full-time job I wondered how I'd find the time tocook every night. This book is all about efficiency. The recipes in this book are fast, inexpensive, healthful and delicious. The smoky white bean soup, mexican pizza, and noodles lo mein have been particular favorites. Ingredient lists are short and contain mostly common items, making grocery shopping quicker and less expensive. But what I'm most amazed by is how truly fast these recipes are without sacrificing flavor. This book is a must-have for busy vegetarian cooks."
4,A great cookbook!,"This is a great book to have on nights where you want dinner on the table within 30 mintues. There are lots of helpful tips about ingredients, substitions, as well as a nutritional break down. New vegetarians will find this book especially helpful and those of us who have been vegetarian for awhile i'm sure will find new ideas. I know I did."
3,Great Food - But Check the Nutrition Info!,"I love this cookbook, use it all the time. One of my favorite recipes is the Mushroom Chowder...Yum!!! BUT....The nutrition information in the book is completely innaccurate - sometimes by more than 100 calories PER SERVING. Luckily I caught it before any damage was done."
1,"It should be called ""BEAN AND PASTA COOKBOOK.""","I assume that these editors know that grains such as quinoa, amaranth, rye, spelt, kasha and [has no one ever heard of?] wheat can make fine main or side dishes. I had hoped for some new ideas for these and other grains and vegetables on which I have thrived for years. Have they never heard of porridges? If you want speed, make porridge. And quinoa cooks in about fifteen minutes. Most small or cracked grains cook in 15-20 minutes.I had assumed that there would be SOME bean recipes, although I am deathly allergic to all beans, and SOME pasta recipes even though pasta, too, ill suits my own particular physiology. Unfortunately, this is a BEAN and PASTA book, with an occasional, genial but uninspired reference to other foods. It makes the book essentially useless to me.Far better books are availabe: The Greek, Italian, Indian vegetarian cookbooks, whole grain cookbooks, natural foods cookbooks.An uninspired disappointment."
4,Good series,This series is quirky and entertaining. The disc contains 4 episodes from the beginning of Read or Dream. The four main characters are well developed and have personalities that make interactions humorous.
3,Came chipped!,I originally ordered this roaster because i like the pink color. Unfortunately it came with some of the coating scraped off. I like the fact that it is really big and can hold a lot. I didn't feel like returning it and i still use it but It should have come in a better condition.
4,Love the Pink,"Although we have not used the pan yet, it is a true size of a roaster pan. The first one that was delivered had handle that was loose and we contacted the company and they sent us another pan, right away."
3,"It takes a little ""wooing""","I use these plays with my below level readers to try and encourage fluid and prosodic reading. However, the content is sometimes a bit dry and requires quite a bit of teacher ""rah-rah"" to get students motivated and drawn in."
3,could've been better...,"This was my very first book on Witchcraft. It's a decent book, but it lacks a lot of detail. Her writing style is friendly, but she seems to skim over a lot of information. Phyllis Curott's Witch Crafting is a better choice."
3,So-So,"It has a lot of info, but it is just mostley a recap of her other books. I bought it, I personally wouldent recommend it.It has some new info, but hardly any."
2,A little to complicated,"I enjoyed many of the exercises in the book but found a lot of it to be a little more complicated than I like my magic. I prefer things simpler. As far as the naked woman on the cover being tacky, I personally thought it was a beautiful picture. Many wiccans to practice there craft skyclad anyway."
5,very moving,"alright this has to be the best most recent book silver has written. she has great ideas to bring magick in to ones life, she teaches you how to cleanse and consecrate your own house, she teaches you how to ghost hunt, its very good, she talks about glamouries, and much much more. there are spells and rituals throughout this book so go and buy it"
1,what happened ot Mama Silver?,"This book was the biggest disappoint ot me out of the To... series. Some of Ravenwolf's first words are ""I am a lineaged witch."" What happened to the Ravenwolf that found a religion that worked for her, and wanted to share it with everyone? Or the woman who said that with dedication and a willingness to study, anyone could achieve what she had?Her initiation into the Gardnerian Tradition is obvious in this book, as her stressing the importance of formal and informal rituals, palnetary hours, and the five fold kiss. In To Stir and To ride she doesn't stress the importance of formality.All in all, this was a sad book in the To... series. She might have some good information, but it's not presented in the way she originally did. It seems like she is the all knowledgable person, and we are lucky to get scraps of information from her."
4,Great Book for those wanting more information on WIcca.,This book is a wonderful tool for those who want more information on the craft. I have been practicing for a few years and it is always nice to get fresh information and a fresh viewpoint.
5,Good book,It's a Silver Ravenwolf book. It's a good book.I have a number of her books. I don't agree with everything she saysbut I am glad to have her books in my collection.
2,not for me,Okay this is a review towards almost all of Silver Ravenwolf's books. I will not use any of it because from my own personal experience it has never helped me. Some people have stated that she goes on about disliking other spiritual paths such as Christianity and for one that's not really why I disliked her books at all. As a matter of fact these people really need to reread her or maybe they never actually read her books in the first place. Her husband is a Christian (if I remember correctly) so how can she 'hate' christianity?I disliked her books because I found that they were way to fluffy and lovey dove for my taste. I found her research laughable at best but in a sort of entertaining sort of way. It seems that she takes herself way to serriously and needs to re-re-research the facts and open her mind a little but than again who doesn't?I guess some people may get value from this book but I myself found it not for me but others might place value with what she writes.
1,To Light A Sacred Flame: Practical Witchcraft for the Millenium,"I would not recomend this book to anyone, let alone the poor novice that picks up this worthless and sometimes dangerous piece of dribble. Her past books are none too better. I was born into a pagan family, so I did not have the problem of coming out of the ""broom closet"" and neither did my four children. However I am extremely disappointed with Silver's encouragement to hide\lie to the parents of her younger readers.Also the spells in the book are rather vauge and incomplete in most cases and contradicting in others. The section on ""Spirits"" is down right frightening. PLEASE....Do not use these Spirits without some real research.Being from a pagan family I seem to be the dumping ground for her books. I wouldn't even give one of these away because I believe them to be less than worthless.Remember........LET THE BUYER BEWARE.....such truer words have ever been spoken about this piece of repetitive fiction passed off as WICCA."
3,I agree yet i disagree,"I have to agree with the fact that Silver RavenWolf has gone too far with the teen witch stuff. Yet, her books are wonderful beginer books. There are losts more out there and the truth is when you stop learning you should be dead so read on everyone read on. We must study every aspect of all religions to truely understand what we beleive>"
1,A Slinky???,"Oh, Please. This book is one of the most silly books ever read. A slinky? Give us a break, will you? At least those of us who have some level of intelligence! It is hardly a book that deserves publishing expenses let alone a book that deserves to be believed or in the hands of anyone seeking realism in practice of the Craft."
1,This book.......... is horrible.,"It's just like all the others. It's boring, it's bullshit, and it's the same information over and over again. It's identical to the others, only rephrased, and with a different title. It's become clear to me that she just desperately needs money. I'm sick of her books, it's like she's feeding off of the vulnerable because they'll believe her shit. She should stop this soon, because people are figuring out what a manipulative fake she is."
3,Not Very Usefull,"This book is not very usefull, but it still has some good information. It's a great book about ritual work, mind magick (i.e. hypnoses), and for the making of a magickal home.The worst chapter was called ""Turning Your Enviorment Into Harmony"" because I am only 14 years old and I am a male Wiccan Witch, and I don't have timeto even meditate when school comes.I liked the two first books better, ""To Ride a Silver Broomstick"", and ""To Stir a Magick Cauldron""."
2,There's better stuff out there...,"There are witchcraft books out there which are so much better then Silver's. This is the equivalent of a 2nd grade text book and it can be very misleading to readers... The only reason why it gets 2 stars instead of one is because it is better then her other books, (Teen Witch? What the...) This woman should immediatly stop her bastardizing of Wicca. There are many mistakes in all her books and depreciates magicK, (Silver wouldn't want us to forget the 'K'), to nothing more then a childish game. Please, if you are considering reading this book, get your hands on some much more intellectually stimulating pagan material."
1,Commercial [junk]!,"I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It is completely useless. There are only exersises in this book and Ravenwolf isn't bothering about any safety methods. Some of the exersises are fine, but you would find them in other books too."
5,HEeeLLO!,You guys are crazy some of these reviews are written by people who didn't even read the book. All of Silver's books have beautiful covers and yes the book has a lot of info. so you people need to shut your mouth and actually read this masterpiece before you comment on it. witchcraft_91730@gurl.com
5,Truth is Truth is Truth,"Having studied/experienced a wide variety of spiritual and religious paths in depth, I am most impressed with Silver Ravenwolf's additions to the field. I find myself amazed at the reviews which claim ""this is not Paganism/Witchcraft"" -- excuse me, perhaps it's not YOUR system, but I find it arrogant for one to assume they ""know"" the be-all and end-all of any system of belief. The more I study, the more I know how little I truly know...and I have been actively studying for over 25 years now. I believe Ravenwolf offers a lot of valuable and interesting information, as well as amusing anecdotes. I am impressed with her attention to what I believe is the foundation of ALL practice - the experience of the Self. Invariably I find self-awareness at the core of every major group into which I have delved. Silver offers several valuable techniques and guidelines to assist in experienceing the inner silence. Nice effort, I look forward to her next book!"
1,The beginning of the downward spiral,"Silver's first two books, ""To Stir.."" and ""To Ride.."" were fairly decent, although there are better books available. I enjoyed reading them both, and still recommend them to beginners along with other material. This book, however, is where she starts to go downhill. Throughout the book I felt as if she were saying ""Well, I know I said do things this way in the first two books, but actually you need to ....."" Everything from this book onward that I've seen by this author is a waste of money and paper."
2,"OK, but not worth the money","I loved Ravenwolf's previous books (Stir a Magick Cauldron and Ride a Silver Broomstick). However, I didn't get anything new out of this book. This book does not encourage the reader to think deeper about the Wiccan/witch/pagan path. Rather, it provides exercises which, while fun and not completely devoid of use, distract one from putting in (HARD) thought and personal effort into the development of one's path. If you want someone to spoonfeed you religion/spirituality, then don't consider paganism.If you want a Ravenwolf book, go with ""To Stir ..."" or ""To Ride ..."" -- these books are much better value, and I enjoy and use my copies (unlike my copy of this book, which I've traded away). Better yet, hold off on the Ravenwolf books until after you've read Marian Green's ""A Witch Alone"" and followed its advice."
1,If I could give negative stars I would.,Reading a Silver Ravenwolf book is like counting the grains of sand on a beach: a waste of time. You will learn nothing from her.
5,Wow,"The book itself is an interesting and thought provocing read, my only qualms being the cover, but then again I dislike all the covers in the series."
2,the cover?,"I've read all the reviews so far, and would be tempted to buy this book, but maybe I'll just flip through it at Border's- like some of the other reviewers, I CAN""T STAND THE TACKY COVERS of S. Ravenwolf's books. I can't take them seriously!Of course, I shouldn't judge books by their covers, but then luckily for the author, most readers aren't as snobby as me!"
4,Cute Brown Bear,"Nice little bear, soft and fluffy. He's a good pal, especially for a child with sensitive skin. Small and portable, he comes along with us all the time."
4,ok,"If you like animals that turn into a robot, you might want this. If you watch the show you know that it used to be the leader of the jungle planet. The horn is the coolist."
3,TF enthusiast,"Definately not one of the most creative TF molds. I bought this one because of the non-symmetrical style of the robot form. The tail of the rhino flips around and becomes an oversized Wolverine-like claw & the right arm is actually the rhino's jugular (a bit sadistic, which scored points with me on a personal level).Kudos for the non-traditional styling, but there is very little difference between the two modes, the rhino looks like the robot and the robot looks like the rhino.For those inflicted with children: This has ankle-nibblin' wallet-leech written all over it. It will absolutely hold up to the abuse most children will show the figure and actually looks like one of the preschool geared figures.For Collectors: Here's one you can skip, unless you want to collect 'em all. Nice try, but boring overall."
3,Transformer Toy,I bought this for my 4 year old grandson that loves transformers. He wasn't too thrilled with this one. Might have been a little advanced for his age. It is durable.
3,"Very good historical work, with good perspective","Basically, this is a book on the history of Coca-Cola, with some really good information on the cola industry as a whole. Well-researched, and well-written, I enjoyed this book. It was especially interesting to see the honesty in regard to the cocaine and caffiene content issues that Coke had to deal with, and later the ""New Coke"" fiasco. My only complaint would be with the length and that its a bit slow moving. The people involved certainly aren't very likeable, but the author does a good job of putting everything into a proper historical context. It even has the ""secret formula"" for the drink, which I found interesting just to know what I'm drinking."
3,Good though it drags in the middle ...,"FOR GOD, COUNTRY, AND COCA-COLA is an interesting and exhaustive read about the history of what is likely the world's best known product, sugar water.Pendergast most definitely did his homework on Coca-Cola. Accordingly, if you were curious about any facet of Coke's history up to the mid-to-late nineties, it's probably included in this book. I kid you not that the last hundred pages are all footnotes - it's that exhaustive.Pendergast's meticulousness is both the strength and the weakness of this book. About halfway through, it starts becoming increasingly less interesting.Thus I rate it a mixed bag. Great in being the definitive history of Coca-Cola, but also somewhat dry and dragging towards the end. But if you are extremely curious about Coke's history and have the will power to read 460 pages of fact after fact after fact regarding advertising schemes and bouts with Pepsi, pick this book up."
4,great book,although the author is a liberal he still wrote a fine book. lots of information and most of it checks out.
2,Meh.,"Sounded really cool, but it writes like a crappy pen and is hard to erase completely (although you totally can."
3,"Runs very large, fabric a bit stiff","I'm pretty sure I'm an XL most of the time, but I'm practically swimming in the one I ordered. Lots of extra fabric in the back, so it's not so flattering. The fabric doesn't feel like a great quality. I'm keeping it as a wear-around-the-house, but I got it to serve as a modest camisole for work and don't feel it's going to quite work for that."
5,comfortable tank top,"THIS IS REALLY COMFORTABLE, IF I SHOULD NEED ANOTHER I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO GET ANOTHER"
3,"Decent, most of the material is there","This set is a pretty good buy for the money. I took the Hardware test recently with just reading this book and making note-card questions myself (I passed). I also found the test questions included with this book as a little easy, the questions on the A+ exam were worlds apart in some aspects, (one question was about a networking protocol or feature that the book didn't even mention!). No one should take these test after just reading the book once. If you read it twice, you're in good shape, if you read it once and make flashcards, you'll do just fine. I cannot recommend any other material, I just used this book, so the dedication of the user has a large impact on a test's results."
3,WAITING FOR NEXT CD,GOOD VOICE. TOO MANY PRERECORDED DRUM TRACKS. HAD THIS CD B4 AND LOST TRACK OF IT. GOOD CUMBIAS AND GOOD DANCING MUSIC. STILL NO ONE INSTRUMENT STOOD OUT BUT HER VOICE MADE UP FOR IT.
1,Thanks for the self-promoting reviews,"I only found the one review to be of help, mostly because the other two already had their own conclusions, and one of them seems like it was written by the author, or her mother. Get real folks!"
5,Ths is Real Music,"This CD contains the best of Kenny Baker's music. The sound is great. Anybody who has ever seen The Harvey Girls, and fell in love with this great voice, will be thrilled with this music. How great to hear the old songs sung with intros, the way they were written, will enjoy this. The man had such a clear tenor voice that it makes listening to music a real joy."
5,want a new sound u will get it here,"I ordered the Grilled Cheese peddel on the 1st, and it shiped the 2nd and i got it with my 2 guitar stands the next day. as for the Grilled Cheese it is a steal for the money.. It works on a Bass as well as a guitar so if u want to boost the power of your amp this is one way to do it and have some fun doing it, i would recamend this peddle to any one that wants to have some fun with there guitar or bass guitar.. i gave this a 5 star for one reasonits a great add on for anyone that plays any kind of elec. guitar or bass guitar and at a cheap price.so get yourself one and have some fun with it"
4,Handy little weapon for your arsenal,"Yeah, it is noisy, but if that's what you want, it rocks. It makes the highs really stick out, and the lows are truly nasty. If you like Industrial, this is probably the one you want. It is also nice for soloing. The sustain really rings out, but it's a little too noisy for string rakes and sweeps. You can also choke the tone off to invoke the spirit of Jimi Hendrix if you so desire. Not bad, and cheap too."
1,You really shouldn't buy this....,"This ""distortion"" pedal is horrible!! It didn't really change the sound of my guitar. No distortion or anything. I certainly would never buy this again."
3,too many ingredients,"I bought both the praline and the chocolate and was disappointed with both. This is not what I would call premium natural fudge. The flavor is almost too sweet, and the texture is too firm. Ingredients include carageenan, disodium phosphate, vitamins a and d, invertase and egg whites. I should have gone with the mackinac stuff I remember fondly."
2,Depressing and sad,"Although I empathized with the boy in regards to his being bullied due to his perceived sexual orientation, I was disappointed by the ending. It was unnecessarily sad and depressing."
1,Don't buy it. Homophobic in the worst way.,"Warning: In this movie a gay teenager fails in a play for a classmate, then dies from an unmotivated accident, falling down the stairs. Be warned: no sympathy for human nature in this nasty film. Additional oddity--the classmate, supposedly a tough, is cast to look ""effeminate."""
3,Not for the faint of heart!,"Good video, good drama but very VERY disturbing!You want the ""nitty gritty"" of gay adolescents? This is the video to add."
2,Simplistic,"What is most surprizing about this short (50 min) film is that it was made in 1991. One would have thought that by then we had gone beyond the 'pre-Maurice' stage of sociological development. E.M. Forster's book could not be published in his lifetime because it's ending did not involve imprisonment or death for the gay couple! This film would have been much more interesting and complex if the boy's love-object could have overcome his school-boy homophobia--even if in private--and there was at least a moment of joy. But this is simplistic: there is no joy and not one moment of understanding for anyone. It does, however, beg the question: is there still rampant and dangerous homophobia in schools today? I think we all know the answer to that one, Matthew Shepard."
2,Strange & Depressing,"Most gay people know what it is like to be ridiculed, ostracized and bullied in school, and can therefore empathize with the movie's lead character. Most gay people also know how difficult it was to come to terms with their sexual orientation, and can therefore understand, although not condone, the lead bully's behavior. However, the ending was so unnecessarily depressing. When the movie ended, my boyfriend and I were shaking our heads, and commenting on how weird it was."
1,baby animals Gyo Fukigawa,I have not received the item. It has been 4 weeks. I asked for a refund and called Jeff Hines with no response as of Feb. 18th. k Benson
5,My favorite new baby gift,This is a beautifully illustrated tender story for snuggling at storytime with your little one.
2,Not that good,"First off let me say I like Nick. I think he is very creative. His role as Terry on Reno 911, his small movie appearances-Blades of Glory, Bench Warmers are hysterical. This is not his best work. The material is very thin with drawn out stories of no point. His first cd is a bit better, and the skit at the end with David Spade is worth the price alone. But, this act doesn't have much of anything. A few chuckles. The audience is obviously been added too, as they roar when it's not appropriate. I know many comics add crowd cheers like sitcoms do, but it's very obvious here, and detracts from what little originality is offered. Too bad, I wanted to like this, it's just not up to par with his other work. Bring back gay robot."
1,"Like, so, like awful...like, so NOT ""amazing""","Umm, this was, like amazing! Notttttt! If you, like, um, talk like this, you will, like, find this guy hilarious (as the Special-Needs, laugh-tracked audience seems to.)If you have any brain cells at all you will sit back and wonder two things:1.How does this guy get to be called a ""comic""?2.What in God's name is this audience laughing at?(Confession: In spite of the fact that the title included the word ""farted,"" (laff-riot, bro!) I played this dreck. My fault, I suppose."
