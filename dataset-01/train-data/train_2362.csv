2,I've tried to like this,"Many years ago I got an LP with Mendelssohn's two basset-horn pieces and Mozart's clarinet quintet. I liked the Mozart, loved the Mendelssohn -- they were sheer delight. As with my other LPs I eventually sought to find a CD replace and bought this. It is a mild delight for the Mendelssohn and a time-killer (or worse) for the rest. I guess this isn't my kind of music (I always run the other way when Beethoven goes into variations) but the performances are also lackadaisical. Witness the basset-horn pieces, which should fill you with happiness but only make you smile a little. I've played it a number of times but, seriously, I doubt I'll ever play it again. Sad. The competition for the Mendelssohn pieces is not fierce."
2,A Disappointment from Remini,"First of all, I love Robert Remini's work. I own multiple volumes of his on Jackson, Clay and Webster. He is the man when it comes to Andrew Jackson biography and his place in the history of the United States. That being said, only his clear narrative writing style saved this book from a lower rating. This was not the study that I expected it to be. The lack of reference material and just not putting the House of Reps in its place in our government has this way below expectation. There are so many forceful personalities and history to work with I was just flabbergasted by the lack of real punch I get from his other work. Joe Cannon, ""Czar Reed, Henry Clay, there is plenty of material on the influence and struggles of the House. I just wish I would have avoided this one."
1,Sponsored by the House,"Regrettably, I didn't do enough research before buying this book. It is a dry, factual account of House history that leaves you feeling like you didn't learn much about the real history of the institution. In my opinion, it paints an excessively flattering and superficial portrait - probably because it was sponsored by the House's 1999 History of the House Awareness and Preservation Act. The book might be useful for your kid's school report, but if you're looking for something that goes any deeper than that or is even remotely engaging, please look elsewhere."
5,Best wipe ever,"This cleaned my butt like there's no tomorrow. I was a little disappointed I wasn't allowed to play with the bag, but the warning is very clear, and I'm not too fond of suffocation, so there you go.I'm glad it worked, because I'd hate to have sent it back for a refund. Eugh."
2,I prefer the lotion kind,"Have you ever had toilet paper so soft, moist, and robust that when you are in the process of cleaning, it not only feels like you're removing something, but also applying something at the same time? That is the standard at which I measure all hygiene products for this specific use. When it feels like paper lotion! This did not feel that way, but I suppose it did the job.If you are going to use this product, I also recommend a Toto Bidet heated seat. It picks up where the paper leaves off."
3,"Jelly Roll's music first-rate, band so-so.",Purchaser beware--this is not the original Dukes of Dixieland but a band using their name and without the flare and energy of the Assunto brothers and Papa Jack. The music is what saves the DVD but the band is a fair journeyman combo at best. This is the first time that I have been caught in this scenario and the band is a far-cry from the Dukes who used to record on Audiophile and at one time featured Pete Fountain.
5,Love Beth Moore!,"Still currently doing the study, but it has been so inspiring and a great study to get into and has so much application to everyday life. I especially like all the references and resources that Beth Moore uses throughout each lesson."
5,A Gift worth gOLD,"Beth brings you deeper into the faith and applying the principles in your daily life like few can. her writings are truly inspired and if you can get the dvd's that go along w/ the workbook...you are in for an amazing time !!The workbook alone IS worth it's weight in gold and will inspire you in so many different ways.If you are looking for a lifechanging workbook, I found this to be a chartbuster !!pS Beth Moore fans...she is on TV !!! 8:30AM eastern time on pAX tVthe show is the Robisons' show called Life Today and Beth is first 15 minutes......You will LOVE it !!!"
1,run don't walk from any Beth Moore Study,This is not a bible study- it is ego-centered pop psych course with random out of context bible verses thrownin. Beth Moore studies do a disservice to women (mainly) who want a serious thoughtful study of scripture.I found the homework simplistic and demeaning to anyone of average intelligence.
1,This Book really opened my eyes.,There were seven of us ladies reading and doing this study we all loved it. It was very eye opening and educational. Beth teaches in a way that a new believer or someone who has been in the Word for years can understand and that makes for a great group study.
5,Book/DVD series is life-changing,"This Bible study series put my faith in perspective and gave me a new understanding of what it means to live in the Spirit. I believe that through prayer, any woman who commits to this 11-week course will come out a new woman of faith with the potential for a closer walk with the Holy Spirit."
4,Living Beyond Yourself: Exploring the Fruit of the Spirit,"Using this book for a small group Bible study with the DVD presentation. Well written, Scripturally based studies.I found it to be a usefull resource."
1,"I love Anna Maxted, but I couldn't finish this one...","I loved Anna's other two books, especially ""Getting Over It."" I love her writing. I love her humor, and I love the fact that she gives substance to chick lit. I gave up on this book after 130 pages though. I tried, I really tried, but nothing grabbed me. I found 'Behaving LiIke Adults' too slow paced, too rambling, too long. Nothing clicked for me from the first page. There were a few golden moments; I loved the image of Holly farting all the way to her date with Stuart! I just didn't want to see her as a victim, even though she was. When she deliberately mis-matched her clients for date night I just thought ""no"" I can't take 350 more pages of this! I'm sorry Anna. I remain a fan. Honest."
1,Disappointing rambling,"This is the first book of Anna Maxted's that I have read and I was unimpressed with it. The book tended to ramble on with the main character never being able to make solid decisions, even before the ""incident."" The supporting characters I found to be obnoxious and detracted from the plight of the main character. Her relationship with her boyfriend was a warped, dysfunctional, much of the bantering in the book could have been shortened. I ended up skipping to the end just to find out what happened. Please save yourself the grief of plodding through this book and pick up one of her other books if you are so keen on starting on her novels."
2,Not Anna's best work,"I read Running in Heels and Getting Over It and was looking forward to reading Behaving Like Adults. The first few chapters or so were pretty good, then it all went downhill. I found myself skimming through at least the last 100 pgs, I just wanted to find out what happened at the end. I agree with other reviewers that there was no warning that the book is almost entirely about Holly's rape and how it messes up her life -- even looking at the cover and the description on the back it seems like a breezy chick lit book. It's def not! The book isn't horrible, but I am glad it was a gift and I didn't pay the 15 bucks for it."
2,Disappointed,"Even though I loved both of Anna Maxted's first two novels I was extremely disappointed in her third, Behaving Like Adults. For lack of better words, this novel was annoying. I forced myself through because I kept thinking I would eventually enjoy it and I was stuck on a plane. The main character, Holly, is frustrating and there were no truly likable characters in this novel. Even though Maxted continues to deal with tough issues, her heroine acts pathetic and doppy most of the time. In her first two novels, I was able to relate and understand the characters and their motives, but in this book the characters are just caricatures and they seem silly. Save your money and wait for the paperback...I wish I did!"
3,In retrospect---a bit too much,"I started reading this one, 'cause I'm a fan of Ms. Maxted's work. I read it quickly and dipped right into the next of her books, patiently waiting on my nightstand. But in looking back, a lot of the plot was just not plausible. It read like a serious sit-com ...misunderstandings that could have been easily remedied with a quick phone call; keeping perfectly-capable people in the dark to protect them emotionally...and so it goes. A bit frustrating, but it's still a good read. Don't expect life-changing stuff, just a good way to pass the time."
3,It should have been more serious,"I like each book Maxted writes a little less than the previous one. But I was looking for a light read on a recent trip to Britain and thought the new Maxted would be just the thing. Unfortunately, this book is anything but light. After the rape at the beginning of the book I just got so mad that the main character, Holly, seemed to be dismissing that it was, indeed, a rape. Maxted really leaves the reader hanging for most of the book thinking that Holly isn't going to face this and the guy is just going to get away with it. I was about to stop reading halfway through, but I continued and was satisfied by the ending. If you're looking for some light Brit-chick-lit, skip this one and head for someone who handles the serious issues much better like Maggie O'Farrell. Otherwise, I'd recommend reading a different Maxted title, like 'Getting Over It'."
1,Better Luck Next Time Anna!!!,"I really enjoyed to first two books. I thought they were great stories that I could relate too. Plus I've been on an English Lit kick lately so I figured why not get the third book too? Well I gave it my best shot and it just didn't come off good at all. I tried to get into the story I really did, but no matter how much I tried it just wasn't going to happen. I gave up about a quarter into the book and started a different one. Oh well. Better luck next time Anna...."
3,What a BORING book...,"I read reviews of Anna Maxted novels and was really excited to read this book .I expected something very funny and witty, I wanted to get a good laugh and also wanted to read a book that had a good plot that could hold my interest.I was dissapointed, BLA does have its funny parts mostly because of the character Nige, and I didnt get enough of him.Overall I found the characters to be bland and unoriginal,usually you should feel empathetic to the main character Holly, I didnt at all, she was too ditzy.Another reviewer said this book seems like an episode of 90210 I agree its one of those really bad episodes when they were in their 30's."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Wow, I really hated this book. None of the characters were well-drawn or relatable. Some authors have the gift of writing so that you can really see what is happening. Maxted isn't one of them. I never got a sense that Holly or any of her friends were real people, so I never cared about what happened to them."
1,Pathetic!,"I agree with a lot of reviews on this book, it tends to ramble on and on and on. When I first started the book, I wasn't automatically brought into the book, but I thought I would read some more and maybe something would catch my attention. I only got to page 58 before I just gave up! Holly makes very light of what happen to her in the beginning and then talks about it to her friend like she allowed Stuart to have sex with her. It made me very angry with Holly that she could do this to herself. I had invisioned Holly as a strong woman, but after that her imagine to me was just a girl who isn't true to herself. This is my first book by this author and I do hope her other book I got is not like this or else I have wasted $12 dollars."
2,Are you Boring too?,"Ok, so this book is boring because it is very slow, I have been reading this book for awhile now, yes not interesting either, and nothing new has happend. I am waiting and still waiting. Ok I am sorry for being extremely rude; but the book is not fast enough that you do not get the feeling that you cannot wait to flip over the pages. The idea is very cute and interesting and still I am reading it just because of that hoping that it will get better and somewhere I will be very happy that I did not stop reading. But if you are commuting a long commute on the BART daily, this is not the book for you!"
1,Behaving Like Adults: A Novel By Anna Maxted,"This is the first book I read by Anna Maxted. Honestly, her other books might be great but this book was about a woman dealing with daterape. I just wanted to unwind over the holiday and an entire book devoted to overcoming rape and the many different ways that it effects a person was not my idea of a good time. Totally disappointing!"
1,Not What I Expected,"My first experience with Anna Maxted was Getting Over It. I fell in love with that book and decided I should read whatever else I could get my hands on by Maxted.I picked up this book expecting it to be funny like Getting Over It, and it just wasn't. Most of the book was just depressing and frustrating to read.I'll give Maxted another chance, but this book was a waste of time for me."
2,Such high hopes...and such lows,"I was excited to see that Anna Maxted had written a new book. I am a big fan of her previous novels ""Running in Heels"" and ""Getting Over It"". I am not, however, a fan of this one. I could barely finish it and found myself just skimming through to the ridiculously stupid ending. I felt no empathy for the characters. It was contrived and at times, seemed like storylines taken out of ""Beverly Hills 90210"". I wish I could say more but I don't want to ruin it for those who may have the courage to want to read it. All I can say is, that while I was reading it, I kept thinking of what the publishers thought when they read the book. Did they honestly think it was quality work or were they just cashing in on the success of Anna Maxted from her previous books?"
2,Do a little Macro research too!,"I was interested to see in the credits, that Shatner did some research into micro science, i.e., nanotechnology and DNA. However, he missed looking into the macro science of geostationary satellites. A geosynchronous satellite CANNOT be placed over San Francisco. Nor can it be at 350 miles, nautical or standard. The only position(s) for such satellites is in a ring at approximately 22,300 miles over the earth's equator.The space elevator in SF is not a new concept. Arthur C. Clarke's ""The Fountains of Paradise"" is the first SF reference I know of. The center of mass for the whole elevator system must be at ~22,000 mile point. A platform could be placed anywhere along the path from ground to mass center point, 350 miles up, for example. It still couldn't be anchored at San Francisco."
3,happy but dissappointed,"Have a Plasti Tacker Pro and it is great for drying in a roof but have found it to be unreliable. The plastic caps hang up just before dropping into place and jam. Thus driveing a nail without a cap. And sometimes resulting in wasting several plastic caps. It also leaks air at the trigger if held open for repetitive driving. I did have the O-rings replaced in the trigger valves but it still leaks air just like before. For the last couple of days I have been searching for a web site that provides professional technical advise but I don't speak German and that is the only thing I could find except for the places to buy something, they were in English."
3,Somewhat dated but worth a read,"The author's premise is grounded on a lot of discredited information such as the Rennes Le Chateau legend and the existence of the Priory of Sion. However, well worth a read as he raises a lot of interesting and thought provoking material despite this."
5,An important publication for football fans,"This year's Register is similar to those have come before it, making it an excellent publication to keep with you on Sunday afternoons.Every player likely to play in the NFL this season is included, along with comprehensive career stats, biographical information, transactions in which they were involved, and any career highlights they may have. The same goes for coaches, whose careers stats are also included. For this year's expected crop of rookies, college stats are included.There is no analysis, only statistics, which is to be expected from the Register. What makes this publication so valuable is that, even with many stats available on the Internet, this is still the fastest and easiest way to find what you're looking for when it comes to football statistics.Along with the 2005 NFL Record and Fact Book, this is a book that football fans should have readily available during the NFL season."
3,Not what expected,The guide was nice and had some interesting facts. But after reading the description was expecting it to cover more than the current year of players.
1,Waste of paper,"The ""Register"" provides nothing that isn't easily available on NFL dot COM. This is nothing more than a listing of all players and their basic stats. Perhaps worth about $4, certainly not $19.It's a shame that STATS, Inc doesn't publish the ""Pro Football Handbook"" or ""The 100-Yard War: Pro Football Revealed"" books any more. Those books were fantastic. Compared to them the ""Register"" is nothing more than a waste of paper."
2,product doesn't work.,when it rains some of the rain goes through the cover.after it rains i have to take the cover off so the rain doesn't make the paint finish cloudy and i have to keep the cover off until it drys.i wasted my money buying this product.
5,A sense of humor,This series is a societal satire on american life and i really enjoyed the series back when i was 15.If you enjoyed Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglass Adams you should enjoy this entire series.
2,"Very good in one way, really bad in another one","It could have been a great book, provided that it was not using Yogi Ramsuratkumar to project one of his American disciples as a master, in a way that is often mere imagination, waking dreams and distorted evidences. One sometimes asks oneself whether the book is really about Yogi Ramsuratkumar ... Had it been only about Him, it would be less thick, more objective, truer and cheaper. The reader has to know that the book was written by one of the students of this disciple and published by the publishing house of the same. If one is able to put this very long hagiographic and biased stuff aside and to stick mainly to Indian disciples and devotees, you will get some great things. Yes, it could have been great! Alas, it is one of the rare books available in the West about the great Indian Sage... Parthasarathy's book is much better and let us hope that other books on 'this Beggar' will come out soon."
4,Nice to meet you,"Some of the pieces in this book are a bit superficial and many tell less about their subject than one would have wished. On the other hand, this is a great opportunity to get acqainted with people you would not ordinarily read about. Among the pieces that dig deeper are those on Whittaker Chambers and Harry Truman. For every reader this book will have its eye-openers and discoveries."
5,I saved a bundle...,"I saved a bundle by buying an earlier edition for my online nutrition class. This book was probably 10 dollars, where as the newer edition was closer to 100.Very Snazzy."
3,"OK, if you don't mind mindless detail","This text is very detailed, which is good, but is missing some important information, which is bad. If you want simple facts, the expense of this book is too much for the benifit you will get from it. If you want details, especially ones that are easy to find, this is not the book for you. It also does not do a good job of objectivity as the quthors political views are very apparent in the text."
2,Needed more information,"The service itself was great but with the minimal info that I was given, I thought I was buying the correct item when I was actually buying the older version of the book. A more detailed discription of the product would clear that up."
5,Great Stuff,"Ihave seen what the poetry in this book has done to get students to think and write creatively. They are havinf fun anf learning more, it is highly recommended."
3,SOME GOOD SOME BAD,First when I opened the box the three bolts that hold the rear housing on were broken off. These can be repaired with some machining. The table does need some heavier duty support. The machine does run pretty quiet for the size of the motor. For the price you could live it.
1,Beware,"1. The table locks are a poor design.2. Impossible to get/keep in adjustment.3. Mine had very bad run out on the disc. This made it next to impossible to get a flat surface on your work piece. When I called Grizzly and complained they said ""send it back and we will fix it"". I did (at my expense) and they sent it back and said they found it to be acceptable. I did not and had a machine shop make me a new disc. Cost me over $200.00. I wish I would have just thrown it away and used that money toward a good one, since I'm still unhappy with it because of the other problems. I have about $350.00 invested.4. After a few months the switch broke. It broke in the on position so at least I can still use it. I just have to turn it on and off with a power strip.5. I hate any tool that does not work well, add in the poor service and I am bitter.Note: None of these problems have any reflection on Amazon, my beef is with Grizzly"
4,"Amazingly effective, even for this skeptic","Pantry moths invaded our kitchen several years ago. No amount of zapping and squishing moths and larvae (sometimes dozens a day!) and throwing away grain products seemed to eliminate them. I bought (with great skepticism) a package of these traps while trying to reach a free shipping minimum on the Solutions.com site. Within 5 minutes after setting out the traps in October, each one held close to a dozen dead moths, and within a week there must have been a hundred. We were still zapping moths (presumably the unattracted females) for the next month or so, but they got progressively scarcer. I've bought two more sets in case of a future reinfestation, but we haven't seen any moths or their disgusting infestation of pasta and starchy product boxes in well over a month. I just wish the Cooperative Extension Service had told me about these amazing pheromone traps when I sought their help at the first infestation."
4,You can't fool all the moths all the...,"I bought a 2-pack of these sticky traps and they worked pretty well but not by following the advice on the package. I had them close to my pantry but would always see the insidious flutterers cruising around my TV in the evening. So I put one on the fireplace mantle about 6 feet from there. There is 50 of those suckers stuck in it now, one month later. The one trap left by the pantry has 10."
4,It attracts & traps Pantry Moths,"Although this trap seems overpriced for what it's made out of (some cardstock, a little tacky glue, and a rubber patch with insect pheremones), it does work. We have used about 10 of them over time, to trap pantry moths in the house (each only lasts about 3 months).Note: putting more than one in a room (pantry, kitchen, or closet) will NOT work better -- in fact, it decreases the effectiveness because the moths get confused about where the ""bait"" is. It seems best if these traps are no closer than a couple of rooms apart."
5,Great product...........,"I've used these for 5 yrs now, they last me around 9 months, not the 3 months as stated and I have a pantry the size of a sm. bedroom. I had an infestation of pantry moths and will now never be without ""traps"", they work well."
5,It Works Good,"It's kind of disgusting to even need a product like this. I've been reassured that even really clean homes will occasionally get moths in the dry goods - it just happens. Part of the process is to get rid of the adult flying moths and this product does that job well. What ever they have have on the trap attracts them and they get stuck in glue part. I suppose it would matter how bad the infestation is, but for us, in a matter of a day the moths were gone."
1,Did not work,"the trap is very small and the glued area is even smaller. It has been set for 3 weeks and has not caught anything, regardless the fact that quite a number of moth fly in the house and even around the trap."
2,"It's somewhat effective, but there are better options...","I found these traps to work fine for the first 2-3 weeks, but then they stopped catching moths. I don't know if it's because the glue got less sticky as a result of dust, or if the pheromone strength wore off. Another problem with this trap is that because of its shape, the moths will fly into the corners and explore the trap, but they might not necessarily go inside and get stuck on the gluey surface.I also tried the Cupboard Moth Traps and I think the Cupboard traps work better than the Springstar traps. The traps are flat, so the moths get stuck almost immediately. Another advantage is that if you notice a moth flying around, you can grab a trap and try to swat at the moth and get it stuck on the surface--you can't do that with the Springstar trap. The trap still has the problem where it seems to lose its effectiveness after 3-4 weeks, but overall I'm quite happy with it."
2,trap problem,"The sticky part of the trap is covered with a non-sticky covering that needs to be removed when the trap is set. When the nonsticky paper is removed, it rips off large portions of the sticky substance, thus rendering the trap much less effective than it would otherwise be. This product is defective in my opinion and should be fixed."
1,don't waste your money,"these traps don't work. I had bought two different types of traps. This one was horrible. True, not even one moth. I have had it for months and nothing. They are the dark brown traps. Don't work, don't waste your money.The one I recommend is theBiocare pesticide free, I think this one ""BioCare Non-Toxic Clothes Moth Trap - 2 Complete Traps"" . It started attracting moths right away and they are all on top of each other stuck there, every inch covered. The trap is like straw yellow color. Works like a charm."
5,Great product! Works like charm,I bought several since my cupboards and closet had become unbearable and my fridge was getting full with all my pantry stuff. So I set up 4 traps and by the time I finished setting them all up I already had 2 of them in there.So far it's been a month and all 4 traps are filled with dead moths! I'll probably buy a few more just to make sure.Great product!
4,Supprising Good Remake,"The story has changed, but the basic premise is the same, a lonely police station is under attack.Good action flick and good performances by some big stars.KM(...)"
4,"A Clever, But Unneccesary Remake","Why remake the cult classic John Carpenter urban western? Because:a) you canb) it's therec) why not?d) all of the aboveIf you answered 'd' then you are correct!!!! A little slow at first, but the action heats up and lets face it, this film has a great cast. It is hard for a filmmaker to build suspense and suprise with a remake, but there are some clever plot twists and loads and loads of action. The language is harsh, even vulgar at times. Ethan Hawke is food as always, but the real fun comes from Larry Fishbourne. He is menacing yet at ease. Another popcorn movie. Sit back and enjoy."
1,Really BAD - REALLY REALLY BAD,"First movie review - I felt compelled to share start after watching this mess.Everyone is on this movie and it still could not be saved. I was waiting Julia Roberts and Billy Bob to make their surprise entrance. 7+ popular actors/performers + bad script (still) = bad movie. What a waste of good talent. All about the payday for these folks, they should know a bad script when they read one."
3,It's an okay movie.,"Assault on Precinct 13 is about a Mafia lord who has had extensive contacts with the police in the department relating to his crime spree. The police want to kill him before he is able to talk about all of the police officers who have been in on the deal. The movie revolves around a thrilling crime scene where police officers--who act like mobsters--seek to enter a police department that is not guarded extensively. Those inside are willing to do everything it takes to guard the place, but there is a problem: I won't reveal it, but it is an incredible ending."
3,"Good action flick, but not as good as the original","This is a good action movie that has great special effects, costumes, some good actors and a significantly larger budget. If you are a fan of the original, you will be able to predict what will happen next about 90% of the time.Using the SWAT team as bad guys created too many questions in my mind. How could they get approval to launch a helicopter and tie up their entire group for an assault on a police precinct without causing suspicion at headquarters? Didn't anybody in the area notice the gunfire? What caused the police and fire department to show up at the end? How did it go from night to daylight so fast at the end?By trying to fill in the holes of the original and add complexity to the various subplots, they created too many unanswered questions. Although the original cult classic by John Carpenter was a low budget thriller, it kept you on the edge of your seat.Sometimes, simpler is better."
1,I want 105 minutes of my life back,Absolute garbage. Hard to believe Ethan Hawke could be involved in this after his stellar performance in Training Day. Completely inconsistent plot. It hurts my brain to even try to understand how this train wreck got made.
4,Hmmm...,"What to say about this remake of a great film. This is one of the few action movies that is character driven and not plot driven. Sure the plot line is always there, but it seems that the director made an effort to show us who was trapped in the building.I really enjoyed this movie. The action is non-stop and keeps you waiting for what will happen next. There are also enough plot twists to keep you guessing.If you are an action film fan this one is for you!"
1,Top 10 Worst Movies of all time,Waste of 35mm. Horrible acting and script. Have no idea why they keep on making remakes of classics just to mess them up. The formula is already there. Was disappointed considering it had a good cast. Not one single actor believed in the script. Don't waste your time nor money.
4,where's the fullscreen version,"I can't find Assault on Precinct 13 on fullscreen that suck. This movie doesn't look like the remake of the original movie that was made back in 1976. I was surprised. This movie is fun. I like the characters and the action is well paced. Ethan Hawk's character was the same as his character in ""Training Day"". Both characters were named Jake and once again he's the good cop fighting the bad cop. Expect lots of twists and betrayal, violence, sex talk in this movie."
2,Overated !,"It's funny right.Throughout the whole movie the convicts and or the Police have full clips at all times.It gets old after you notice it two times in a row.Your able to notice this because the clips on the MP-5 are clear , and you'll notice the clips stay full even after Larry Fishburne or Ethan Hawke unload the entire thing on 1 man.There's a few things that were realistic and pretty cool ,but the majority of the movie was cahcah.I gave it two stars for the weapons , lol."
2,cheesy movie and amateur actors,If you have never seen the movie don't worry you have not missed nothing . But for 5 dollars what do you expect ?
2,communal show,"Good shoot em up, break out the beer and have a couple of friends over, y'all can bs during most of the movie."
1,Poor quality,This DVD is in a very poor condition. It will only play on certain of my devices. I really am surprised as most DVD's I have ordered off Amazon is usually in a very good condition. This saddens me as I really like this movie but can now only watch it when I'm at a device that actually reads it.
3,not hd's fault,"this is a decent movie, but not one that makes hd shine. its shot dark and grainy so it doesnt look very impressive in hd, but its not the movies fault. although the hd surround sound makes it decent"
4,Don't assault my pop corn,"Its a real popcorn film. Don't expect too much logic-no communication at this day and age...anyway, the solid actors made it believable. The film is action packed and does not leave you with too much room to think, or look for any logic in the plot. Ethan Hawke and Fishburn are convincing, and so is the evil Bryne. The two women are sexy-Bello and De Mateo, and that is always good eye candy in an action pack movie.I was surprised to see such a great cast in all the roles.Its an enjoyable action thriller, with plenty of twists and turns at the right time.Grab your popcorn and enjoy!"
3,Hmmm......liked the original better,"I watched this 'un all the way to the end, but after reflection, I have to say, the original was better. I really liked the bad guy, Bishop, a very interesting villain indeed, and would like to see more of him. For his sake, I watched the movie to the end. Otherwise, not much that's new or fresh here."
3,not as good as the previous edition,"I got the previous edition from Walmart for over 5 bucks and loved it. So I thought this one would be better. But it wasn't. Surely, they have better technologies and better weapons, but it was not there. ""Just another action movie."""
2,Don't they make good movies anymore?,"Answer: Not many! It seems that 9 out of 10 movies I watch lately, suck! This wasn't the worst of the bunch, but it still wasn't that good. I thought the story to this movie was stupid, and unbelievable.The movie had some decent action here and there, but the fact that 90% of the movie took place in one spot,made it boring. The only good thing I can really say about this movie was, that the sound quality was very good. If you have a good home theater system, you'll be impressed with the sound. Worth a rent I guess, definitely not worth buying. One final thought, the woman from the Sopranos does not look anything like an Iris, she looks more like a Mary or Tina."
3,Good Movie with a question.,"I have not seen the orginial movie from 1976, but I enjoyed this movie non the less. It had great action and it kept you guessing who the bad person was in the precinct 13. The only question that I have is Where in Detroit is there a pine forest?????? I live south of Detroit and there is no pine forest that I am aware of."
2,"""Assault On Your Brain!""","This is another attempt to ""remake"" a minor classic film. The original kept you on the edge of your chair, this film makes you want to fall out of it! The poor actors do their best with the wooden dialogue they're given, but it's strictly a brainless piece of film that just doesn't work. Check out the original. It may be dated, but at least it is more enjoyable than this piece of muck."
3,good for a plane ride,"This is not a review of the movie per se , but more so for the umd product. I got a new copy through Amazon for $10 , which included the shipping costs. The movie is not enhanced for the 16 x 9 format so you get the original 2.4 : 1 aspect ratio. This means the black bars at top and bottom of screen. On the medium or wide shots the details are hard to see as the action takes place at night and the movie uses a blue color palette. Otherwise , sound and video are very good. Disc includes previews , deleted scenes and three making of featurettes.Overall , it was worth the 10 bucks"
4,What a Surprize,"Man,this movie caught me off guard.This was very intertaining from the first scene to the last.Plus the cast is really good.Laurence Fishburne is terrific !I saw this as a rental,now I will buy it."
4,Definitely worth an evening of your time,"As the extras mention, this is essentially a remake of Rio Bravo. The movie wasn't billed as high art, and it isn't! But it is a good action movie, with enough of a plot to make you think. It also has so many subplots as to make your head spin. And everyone loves yelling at the screen that they knew the plot twists all along... Sure ya did :) Fishburne's character was awesome... a man who knows who he is... vs. Hawke's character - whose job is to find himself. If you accept the movie for what it is... entertainment, you will have a great time! Enjoy. Oh yeah, one last note.. the weapons the assault team uses are state of the art - I wish my department gave out toys like that!"
1,Stay away from this one,"The plot is just stupid: a crooked police department try to kill a criminal and an entire police precinct (one of their own) that guards said criminal.And it get worse. Police tactics from SWAT entries to sniper shooting are so wrong. How about just walk in the precinct, dressed as police officers, and tale over. How about tossing the people inside a phone and talk to them. Save your money and time. Stay away."
3,Good Scientific evidence,"I liked the scientific evidence brought up in this book and the logic it had. It even addressed topics like the 'primordial soup' theory that evolutionists favor. It's a little deep at parts, and I don't really like that it goes along with orthodox science's idea that the earth is billions of years old, but it is an overall good book and has good arguments that prove Creationism from an orthodox view. I recommend it because of many of the good argumentative points it brings up. I used the RTB model in a speech in college."
1,Empty Words,"Rana and Ross's beliefs blind them to the reality of the scientific knowledge gained over the past 200 years. Their attempt to bring together results from biology, chemistry and geology to show how puzzling the origin of life is, utterly fails. They totally omit major portions of research currently underway with in biochemistry, chemistry, and biology, that show a variety of potential pathways to the emergence of proto-life. In the end, the authors fail to prove their point. Just more supernaturalistic excuses for why there has to be a God."
5,A Scientific Challenge to the Evolutionary Paradigm,"This is the first book I have seen that seriously challenges the evolutionary explanation for the origin and development of life from a Christian perspective. Presented in a solid science framework, the authors propose a fascinating testable creation model that simply cannot be ignored by origin of life researchers. This book is the latest and best on this topic. I highly recommend it for the science oriented high school student through the graduate level."
3,It's Complicated,"Though much of the science goes right over my head, the main message of this book is clear: life on Planet Earth is too complex and interdependent to believe that a designer was not behind it. The authors are old Earth proponents who find the naturalist explanations for how life began to be lacking. I'm not sure that the authors have sold me on their version of how life began, called the Reasons To Believe Testable Creation Model, but they do a great job showing how current naturalistic models fall apart or are so improbable as to be statistically impossible. I fear this is a part of Earth's story we will never know for sure."
4,A good ending to a fairly good trilogy,"Much of this novel was redundant... just repeated information from the first two novels. In a way, I see the nessecity of this to remind the reader who the characters are and why they are how they are but it gets really old, really fast. All-in-all, I loved the whole trilogy and the introduction of Montrevant from the Grail's Covenant Trilogy was a masterfully nice touch. Good Job, Gherbod."
2,Well at least it fits into my bookcase,"When reading a commercial tie-in, it would be unfair to expect any great literary triumph, but I endured the entire trilogy expecting, at least, to learn a little more about White Wolf's World of Darkness, and to be told a complete story. Silly me!What we get in the books isn't too bad, it just that it could have been a lot better. The globetrotting plot fails to capture any of the flavors of its European Settings and Fleming's heavy-handed handling of the prophecy elements of the story detracts from its whole. It also suffers from a very poor ending.However, the characters are fun, the story is well paced, the action suitably violent, and Fleming obviously knows his stuff about the World of Darkness. If you are playing ""Vampire The Masquerade"" I would recommend it, but if you are a Storyteller don't expect too much inspiration from it."
2,17 month lifecycle,"It was relatively straight forward to replace and install on my furnace.I replaced the motor in March 07, after 10 years of operation from the OEM motor. This replacement motor only lasted 17 months. This motor of course only has a 12 month warranty, now requiring me to replace it again after one season. The voltages being delivered to the motor are consistent, and it is somewhat of a disappointment that it was not built with longevity in mind."
3,"Killer Sharks, Oil Rig Maliscious Mischief, and Raging Hurricane Hilda!","I enjoyed A Requiem of Sharks (1973) by Patrick Buchannan. It was a quick easy read, only 211 pages in length. The prose is amazingly simplistic (too simplistic?). The novel was published in a hardcover first edition in 1973 by Dodd, Meade & Company. There is a book club edition. I would classify the genre of the novel as being a murder whodunit.Talk about cold and unfeeling: when a naked redhead is suddenly attacked and killed by a shark in Lisa Dantzler's swimming pool, Lisa and her brother-in-law/attorney NicK Wiggins show a total disregard to the victim."
5,Perfect companion for the Green Man student,"William Anderson and Clive Hicks have produced a work of art. Beautifully photographed, it tells the whole story of the Green Man, from its European background back in the Gothic period, to the meaning it holds today. Check it out, you'd be mad to miss it!"
3,A little too much and poor sound quality,"Even though this was recorded just a couple of years ago the sound quality is not that good. It sounds like it was recorded in the 70s and outside with the microphones far away. There is nothing too deep here and all the fanfares are fairly short, just lasting a few seconds it seems. I got tired of this pretty quickly and it doesn't stand up to repeated listenings and to be honest a lot of the stuff on here sounds the same. The performances are ok, but nothing special, they sound kind of flat, and they don't really do anything to make this sound exciting like it should. Maybe if the performance and sound was better I would of enjoyed this more."
5,Great Deal,"This is a great deal on a hard to find item. I searched in a few retail stores, but had no luck finding the replacement brush heads. I had to chuckle when Amazon asks the standard question of whether you want to search for new or used! HA"
5,Relaxing and Beautiful!,This CD is relaxing and beautiful. We purchased this for our pet birds. It relaxes them and makes them feel like they are with all the songbirds along with beautiful music. My husband and I are birders. We love the piano music along with the songbirds. It's beautiful to hear the two. It relaxes you and puts you in a quiet place away from city life.
4,"Interesting, but didn't stick to the rules","There are rules to all forms of fantasy. For instance, if you go back into the past, you aren't supposed to let anyone know who you are. Sadly, some of the rules are broken in this book. But, it was still good. The description was great... and I loved where they traveled to. This is not a book I would recommend, though."
5,Awesome brake light cover!,"I bought this brake light cover to replace my old cracked one. When it arrived I was very happy to see that it is actually smoked and not green like in the picture! It was very easy to install, although it came with bulbs I went with Red LED bulbs to keep the heat down and prevent it from cracking like my old one! Plus the LED's give it an awesome look while keeping it low cost compared to other led brake lights! I would recommend this to anyone, and remember if you want to add more style to this cover search 211 LED bulb red on amazon! IT'S AWESOME!"
3,"neat idea, not real convenient though","It's a great idea, if you stick with it. I think it's just as easy if not easier to go straight to the book. You also have to take time to add in all the dates, etc. Too time consuming."
5,First class performance and record,The Leipzig Quartet performs both works extremely well. The recording is both warm and transparent. Mozarteans and lovers of chamber music should buy this one.
1,Capitalist rip offs!,"It makes me angry to think that people have no morals- yes, you! To ask so much for a kids' toy that orig. sold for $7.99. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Yes, it's a great toy, but I won't buy it again at this price. I might have for $15 or $20, but $50?! Hasbro should come after you. We'll suffer without it. Thanks"
1,How Ridiculous,I can't believe this vendor is trying to charge so much for this product. You can find it on ebay for 8 bucks. Give me a break.
1,price??????NO,When i was younger i saw this set in a grocery store for only 4.00$ i asked my mom if i could get it but she said no.So i came to amazon a few years later (this year) hoping they would sell it for a reasonable price but then i saw how much it was selling for........90 DOLLARS!!!!????? I saw this on Ebay brand new for only 9.99.These people are sick if they are trying to sell a very small children's toy for this much $$$. I am very disappointed in you amazon.
3,Review,Did not like this producy because the wrap around band is not stretchable.Some people might like this. Had a previous one from a competitor that wasstretchable and enjoyed that one much more.
3,it is ok,I am a swimmer and I don't play tennis. I hurt my elbow from weightlifting and I found that this Tennis Elbow doesn't work for my elbow. It is to big!!! I used the jumper's knee strap and it works perfectly for my elbow
5,A must have for any collection.,"This is the new, updated edition of The New Arthurian Encyclopedia published in hardcover in 1991. As with the older version, it provides more than 500 new entries that cannot be found in the 1986 Arthurian Encyclopedia. The update also contains a 40-page section compiling the various addendums that have appeared in The Arthurian Yearbook since 1991. It is disappointing to note, however, that these new items were not incorporated into the main work.Arranged alphabetically, the Encyclopedia remains the most invaluable reference resource for the Arthurian Legend. Each entry is written and signed by a scholar of Arthurian studies, and is followed, where necessary, by a short bibliography. The index is much easier to use than the one in the original volume. A must have for any collection."
5,Excellent live album,This is an excellent live album by some very good musicians and singers. It is interesting to hear the songs you already know singed by another. Highly recommanded.
4,Pretty good game considering I'm not a big video game fan,"So my husband got an Amazon gift card and was looking for something to buy, and remembered this great game he used to play called Elebits. So we ordered it and I received it in the mail today. I played for about 30 minutes (including the tutorial) and found it quite enjoyable. I'm not big into video games, especially ones where you get killed multiple times. I just don't find those fun, but you can't die in this game, which was a big plus for me.One of the drawbacks is the camera. You have to control where you go with one hand and what you look at with the other, which for me was semi challenging. So far that is the only down side I've seen."
4,Nothing Like I've Ever Seen,"I love this game,it's nothing like I've ever seen before.It's not to hard and not to easy but the second to last level is a little challenging,wich is to be expecting since it's close to the end of the game.This game is fun as you go along zapping elebits with your gun.The music is good too as there are many different tracks.To bad this game didn't do that well,I would have loved for them to make anthor Elebits game for the Wii.Children and adults alike will like this game."
4,Elebits,"For an inexpensive game, this is very entertaining for our 10, 8,5 year olds, however there tends to be alot of agruements on the two player mode."
4,Frustrating But I Can See The Appeal,"There are a lot of good reviews for this game, but--for me--this game was just frustrating.After about 2 days of playing I got to a level where the game just ceased to be fun and challenging and went into the realm of annoying. Sure it is fun that you can open doors, shatter things etc but you have to move stuff and it gets stuck in front of doors and then you can't get out etc etc etc. Then the monotony sets in.The edit mode is neat but for just me playing this the appeal wore off pretty quickly. Sorry! If you like games such as lemmings and worms you will probably find this immensely entertaining but if you were looking more for katamari this doesn't quite reach that level of fun. Again, this my opinion :)"
5,Fond memories of TA and fuzzies,"I was so happy to pick up a used copy of this book! For so many years I heard of warm fuzzies and cold pricklies but reading the story, and seeing the sort of old-fashioned (70s?) art was really sweet. I wish I could get a dozen copies to share.I also recommendT.A. for Teens and Other Important People (Transactional Analysis for Everybody Series ; #5)if you are interested. I read it when *I* was a teen and thought it was wonderful. I still think TA is pretty cool; sure beats a lot of other self-help nonsense I've seen over the years.It's too bad that so many people seem so threatened by this book. I sure can't figure that out."
5,A Masterpiece of Marketing Information!,"What can I say...Dave gives the listener, straight, hard, facts and real world examples of how to make marketing work. There should be no question on whether or not you know what to do next, once you listen to this CD. It has changed my business tremendously! Keep in mind that this CD is created by one of the sharpest marketing minds in the world..."
3,OUT OF DATE AND NOT COMPLETE INFORMATION,"THIS BOOK IS OUTDATED AND REALLY WON'T SERVE YOUR NEEDS NOW. IT HAS MOSTLY INFO ON BUILDING LOW MHZ CPU'S WITH OLD FASHIONED SIMM MEMORY. I HAVE NEVER BUILT A PC BEFORE AND YOU NEED MORE INFO THAN THE BOOK PROVIDES. IT DOESN'T TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT PARTS WILL WORK TOGETHER. BECAUSE THE INFO IS OUTDATED IT DOESN'T ADDRESS COMPATIBILITY ISSUES. SOME EXAMPLES ARE: A HARD DRIVE OVER 8.4 GB WON'T WORK ON OLD MOTHERBOARDS, THE DATA TRANSFER RATES (UDMA) HAVE TO BE COMPATIBLE BETWEEN THE MOTHERBOARD AND COMPONENTS OTHERWISE THEY WON'T WORK PROPERLY. IT MOSTLY TALKS ABOUT SIMM MEMORY BUT DIMM IS PROMINENT NOW AND YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW THE NONASECOND SPEED DETERMINES WHAT DIMM MODUAL TO BUY AND STUFF LIKE THAT. THIS BOOK GIVES VERY BASIC INFO AND BOTTOM LINE: WHEN YOU ARE SPENDING $500+ WITH NO KNOWLEDGE YOU NEED TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL. WITHOUT ALL THE DETAILS YOU WILL WASTE ALLOT OF MONEY. SPEND A LITTLE MORE AND GET A HIGHLY DETAILED CURRENT BOOK."
2,"Well Done, but Dated","Clear, easy-to-read, but Pentium Pro processors aren't exactly cutting-edge anymore. It relegates PIIs to ""advanced"" and doesn't deal with them. Nice as a general reference, but pass it up if you want specific considerations for building a PII or PIII."
4,Just seemed to be lacking in places,"Most of the material was very current in this latest edition. However, as a PC building novice, even I noticed the glaring omissions (such as how to install an internal modem) Clearly AGP will the standard for video cards in the not-so-distant future, but not enough was said about them. I was happy to see PII processors discussed, but I could have lived without seeing the same pictures and text all over again. Overall, pretty thorough, but I feel like I need other books and materials to fill in gaps."
2,A Little Out of Date,This book should have presented more up-to-date information on new hardware. I was disappointed with the coverage of how to buy parts and there was very little about what parts from my old computer would work in the new computer. Look for a newer book that talks about current equipment and avoid this one.
1,Nothing like the picture,"The wreath I received looked nothing like this picture aside from the colors being the same. The artifical flowers used to create this wreath look cheap, and many of the buds were missing from the stems."
4,works well; a bit pricey,"If you've got a printer that utilizes this toner, hopefully you have a sound business plan. In which case the price is not a deal-killer."
1,A waste of money,I bought Human 3D and I also bought a $1.99 cd on the body and it turns out the $1.99 was better than Human 3D. I through Human 3D in the grabage. I would be imbarressed to give it to anyone.
1,Don't buy the 2CD version!,"I bought this and it won't even load in Windows 2000! I just plain doesn't install. They have a patch on their website but I gave up. Maybe the 4CD version is better but avoid the 2CD version, definately if you're in Win2k. At least I got a nice double-CD case out of it!"
1,HORRIBLE!!,I bought this cd at officemax and it is the WORSE program on my computer... It's even more frustrating than a virus!
3,serves my needs,"I must say I was surprised after reading such horrible reviews of this product. It works fine on my computer, installed just fine, and will serve our needs. Yes the annimation isn't the most superb but it meets our needs fine. I will say I use windows XP though, and noticed the bad reviews were from users using 2000. I am a homeschooling mom of 6 and it will be a good source for teaching human anatomy. I have the 1 installation disk software."
4,Good read,Also has lots of helpful information and tips for anyone who is trying to become a better leader. The communications section is especially important and useful.
4,Good text on leadership,"We've used this text in a graduate school class I'm completing, and it has been very helpful in crystallizing my thoughts about leadership. The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership presented here are backed by solid research and would help just about anyone become a better leader. I give it four stars only because it is unnecessarily long. There's a good 300 page book in the 400 pages I read - a sure sign the authors are in love with their own writing. Still, very solid overall."
3,Good book,Good book to have for any leader. One of the more practical leadership books. Not too hard of a read. Book arrived quickly and in good condition.
5,"""Unequivocally superior book on leadership""","As other reviewers have commented; there is a ton of information in this book. I will add; tons of fantastic information! This is a book I have been reading sporadically for the past nine months. Why have I taken so long to read it? I will read it for a while, put it aside, read another book, then return to this one. It is profound. The only book on leadership better than this (maybe): Principle Centered Leadership.The copy I read was the first edition. I've skimmed through this edition and found that the authors have added websites and other informative stuff to keep it up to date.Each time I've returned to this book I wonder: why did I ever put it down? If you are a manager or an aspiring leader, like me...Read this one. You'll be glad you did. I know for a fact, this book is required reading for certain business majors."
1,"Great Project, Confusing Results","Aldama looks at Chicano texts that deal with gay issues and ask what they say about sexuality, ethnicity, and identity. Aldama is an academic's academic. No matter what college has him, they should give him tenure.However, as a lay reader, I found this book to be convoluted hyperbabble. I doubt anybody besides graduate students would find it useful. The structure of his chapters seemed nonsensical to me. He takes several pages and paragraphs to say things that could have been stated much more succinctly.I found this book to be disappointing in numerous ways, but that is not to say it isn't rigorous."
1,Run! Run far far away!,"I used this and not only did it take forever to get my nail polish off, it left me with chemical burns! You can see the layers of skin that were worn away! If this is gentle I'd hate to try their regular formula!"
3,A beautiful city and a decent video,"I watched this right after the awful ""A Travelers Guide To Italy"" DVD, and this prodution shines by comparison. The music is taseful, and the camera-work is professional, giving good views of Venice. It does get a bit repetitive. There are too many shots of small side canals in overcast weather, and not enough panoramic views to help orient the viewer. Very little of the video was shot on sunny days, whic may reflect the budget of the production as much as it does the local weather. Some brighter scenes might have brought out the beauty of the city more. All the camera angles are simple ones on the ground or a boat, much as one could get with a decent 3-chip camera and a tripod. I realize crane and helicopter shots are expensive, but one feels the lack of budget when trying to get an overview of an entire city.As a mood piece it is OK. As a preview for a visitor (my intended use), it is lacking."
5,Beautiful music and scenery,"I was unexpectedly pleased with this DVD. It can be used as a calming relaxation DVD or for more informational purposes. It comes with a descriptive booklet, but the same information is provided on the DVD. You can look up information about the places in each section and the musical pieces that accompany them, either in the booklet or on the DVD. There is a brief descriptive title indicating the general locale at the beginning of each section as the film is viewed, but the main menu indicates where the more detailed information can be found. The scenery of Venice is beautiful and relaxing. The music is equally gorgeous."
1,What is Mike Wallace thinking?,"I heard the single several times, admittedly on the Imus in the Morning program, which mostly panned it. If this project is for a laugh or for fun, then it's a totally different story...in that case, this project makes sense. On the Imus program, Mike Wallace called in to explain after the as usual dead-on Imus crew laughed their heads off over the piece. Mr. Wallace's serious rationale was that this was not necessarily for fun, but was done to help Pat Period's career. If Pat Period is so good, which he is not, then why does Mike Wallace, of all people, need to go into the studio to help him?This piece is goofy, ""lounge-lizard"" stuff trying to sound like the Rat Pack without the Rat Pack's sense of genuine style."
4,60 Minutes Swing,"Mike Wallace and Pat Period hit the big band groove in this great tune for any Sinatra fan. A perfect cd to play around the Holidays. Think Frank Sinatra crossed with Big Band crossed with modern jazz. Sounds odd, but try it, you'll love it."
2,I really love the World of Tiers serise - not so much this specific book,The positives: part of the World of Tiers series which I really like. Phillip Jose Farmer has an incredible imagination!The negatives: the book really doesn't complement the series and fails at being interesting or integral to the other books.
1,Let's just put it this way,"The opening line of the book goes like this ""Jim Grimson had never planned to eat his fathers balls."" I swear to you this is the first line of the book!!! How does this get published?"
5,It is impossible to demand better,"If I had to choose a single record to come with me to a lone island, I would take Mozart's Piano Concert n 20 - K 466 -, superbly and magistrally played by Howard Shelley and The London Mozart Players. The concert himself, in my opinion, is one of the musical pieces where it is possible to fell better all the musical genius of Mozart. I deeply recommend it to everybody, because it is impossible to demand better to a composer or to a player."
3,Spend the money,This is standard issue for enlisted but when we go downrange we get issued Danner's in theater. Buy the Danner's for almost twice the price if you're not PT'ing in them. These are good for boot/utes but wearout faster and aren't nearly as comfortable... by a long shot. Didn't even pack them for Afghanistan and only wear them if both pairs of Danner's are offline.
5,Excellent!,"Anybody who thinks that Charles Ives is hard to understand, will surely have their mind changed by this distinguished cd. Thompson and Waters give us a ravishing sound, perfect balance between their two instruments, and a beautiful interpretation that leads you forever on. It is a classic performance - one for the ages. I can't praise it too highly.To compare this one to Hilary Hahn's highly praised - but in my view, deeply flawed - performance, see my review on the appropriate page."
5,The most complete trail guide is HIKING THE GRAND CANYON.,The most complete trail guide is HIKING THE GRAND CANYON by John Annerino
3,OK book,"The first couple of chapters gave a very good overview of the canyon formation, good to know tourist information for the backpacker, and a map. Unfortunately, I found the map difficult to read because of the colors used to format it. I was also hoping for more depth and discussion about the various trails from the South Rim to the river. This is a well rounded book. It does give a quick (but vague)overview of what a backpacker needs to know. This ""guide"" lives up to its claim for being just that. I would recommend this book for the novice Canyon goer"
2,Not nearly enough detail on basic information,"This book is full of intersting tidbits on the history of the canyon (who was the first person to run the canyon rim-rim, geology, ecology, people history and so forth) - this makes up well over half of the book. The rest of the book skims the trails offering less information than can easily be found on the net. I am planning a trip to GC and am dissapointed that I will clearly be buying another book to give basics like for starters - a diagram of the trails."
4,a reviewer from miami doesn't know what he's talking about,"solid CD--varying quality, as most tribute CDs are. I'm not sure why the Miami reviewer feels his/her OPINION of particular songs is more valid than the previous reviewer's. These are individual opinions; there is no ""correct"" view of a song. Get over yourself and enjoy the music--or not--without pronouncing that someone with a different opinion from you is ""not a real fan."""
1,Not worth the Money,I have to say that this is not a very user friendly product at all. I took a chance buying it because I didn't see any reviews posted. Initially I had trouble loading the software because of the quicktime verison that I already had on the computer. Then I had troubles seeing the entire product because you have to set your computer screen at a higher resolution than we have. There are also mulitple windows that open when you open the program... one window doesn't even have anything in it! It doesn't come with a users manual and it's difficult to add pictures or navigate through the software. I don't recommend this at all.
1,carter pump,"Sorry but, this particular part was defective.however, I was refunded my $ wit not problems. Thks amazon. Will never purchase this particular brand. I a going German.."
1,I've burned up 2 pumps in less than 6 months...,"I drive a 2002 Yukon, 4.8L. I use it for getting too and from work and for cruising around town and never beat on it in any way. I replaced my factory fuel pump about 6 months ago with a Carter pump after mine went bad. That pump lasted about 3 months before it died for no apparent reason. Thankfully Carter has a warranty on their products and replaced it free of charge. Well, about 3 months after that second pump was put in it too died for no apparent reason..... I've had every test imaginable run on my truck to see if its a truck problem or a pump problem. Well, there was absolutely nothing wrong with my truck.. Instead of allowing history to repeat itself for a third time I'm just gonna go with an OEM pump. Thanks for nothing Carter.."
5,Motorcycle fuel pump,I used the Carter fuel pump to replace the original unit on my 1992 Yamaha TDM 850. Installation was easy and the carter was small enough to fit where the original Mikuni unit mounted. The pump is quiet and works perfectly in this application at less than half the Yamaha part price. And added bonus it is made here in the USA. I had to move the filter location further from the pump and so had to change the supplied fuel line. Power feed to the pump is from a relay box next to the original mounting location.
1,Unexpectedly very poor quality,I ordered 8 place settings for my wife for a Christmas present. Every single place setting was seriously defective. The glazing was inconsistent with spots of no glazing on virtually all pieces. Some of the cups have rough glazing on the rims where you drink. I have never seen such poor quality in any kinda of dishes. The worst brand at Walmart is much better that what you get here. Do not buy these; you will be very sorry. I'm returning the entire set and have a very disappointed wife.
4,Worth the purchase,"A musical tour of one of the most beloved and beautiful cities of Europe. A city that welcomed Mozart and became his home away from home.He composed two pieces while there, one of which was the ""Prague"" Symphony, Number 38.The DVD is very nicely priced and is a great overview of the city, showing most of their ""old town"" architecture and most famous tourist hot spots.You won't be disappointed."
4,Great Gauge,"This was actually a purchase for my husband. I was having tire pressure problems and he was having to check them every couple of days. He has only had very good comments about the new tire gauge. He finds it very sturdy, acurate, easy to use, and easy to read the face numbers. It was a good purchase, and we would recommend it to others.Sonya Hamilton"
4,Handy tire guage,"I bought a couple of these, one to keep in each car to maintain proper pressure. I always check the tires before a long trip, but in day to day driving, I sometimes get that pesky dashboard warning that a tire pressure is low. If away from home, I stop at a handy pump at a gas station to top up the tire. The station pumps usually have lousy gauges, so keeping a gauge in the car lets me get it right. I've not checked the accuracy but the two I have are at least self consistent."
3,autogage,there is no 1 or 2 psi reading on it and the head doesn't swivel so it makes it hard to get into some places. ie motorcycle tires
1,WARNING,"I just received my Auto Meter 2343 so I have no comments yet about it. However, the web site advertises that the Moroso 89590 Gauge Cover is often purchased at the same time. So I purchased it too. I found that the cover is much too large for the Auto Meter gauge. I'm sure it is intended only for Moroso pressure gauges. Amazon is giving me a refund but be aware and save yourself a hassle."
3,Auto Meter Tire Gauge,"Disappointed the gauge is imported. Also, the unit does not swivel, and is therefore not as user friendly as it should be.For me, Asian imports = a lack of durability - especially with tools!"
5,These gauges completely rock!!,"I've bought a lot of tire gauges over the years - and thrown them all away - but I've bought my last one now. Well, I've bought my last TWO now since I got one for my wife as well. Order this item with confidence."
5,Hardy's Classic Wessex Love Story,"Having rediscovered Thomas Hardy only recently, I am simply entranced by his excellent prose, his keen powers of description and observation and his spellbinding characters. This is a classic love story about Bathsheba Everdene and her three suitors. A tale which will delve into tragedy before Bathsheba finds salvation at the hands of one of suitors. Many regard this as the first great novel in his ""Wessex"" series, which includes the ""Mayor of Castlebridge"". Those interested in reading Hardy's work will find ""Far From The Madding Crowd"" a splendid introduction."
2,List of Facts,"Although the material may be accurate and relevant to the topics found on the MCAT, it would be difficult to learn it from the format presented here. The text and explanation are extremely minimal, and the review questoins at the end of the book are far from excellent."
2,You get what you pay for -,"This book provides a good , basic intoduction to power systems. However, the number of errors and typos in this book is unexceptable. Every section has several errors in it. Many important topics are glossed over. After being out of school for several years, I have been using this to review subjects for the P.E. exam that I don't work with on a daily basis. This is not the book to use for this because of the number of errors."
2,Full Revision Needed,"In view of the fact that ""Ideal for self-study!"" is one of the Schaum's milestone assertions, one could expect that those kinds of books are fully revised before being published. Unfortunately, it seems they are not. Nasar's book sounds interesting, but it has too many errors. This is of no help for those who want to prepare a subject by their own. I recommend not to buy this 1989 edition."
2,Wish I had read the reviews about the errors before buying.,"Ok for review of power systems, However many typo's or errors. If I was Mr Syed A. Nasar I would be embarrased to have my name on this book. In the first chapter alone there are more than 10 errors. If anyone knows where to find the McGraw Hill errata page for this manual please post the URL, it will be a great service. If I find it I'll repost."
1,stinks and useless,This book should not be sold to students because it is no good. I felt like my money went down the drain due to the fact that the book is very stinks and useless.I should get my money back because the book is helpless to me.
3,Issue being resolved,"Had issues, got a new light to replace bad one and just need to get installed. lights of America took care of problem."
1,Junk!,I purchased two of these lights about one year ago and they recently both stopped working within a month of each other. Make sure you save your receipt because the company will do nothing for your without it. That is if you want to go through the hassle and expense of shipping it back and waiting 30 days. The mounting system for these is very flimsy also and it does not seem very durable. What a shame because it looks like a great light and is efficient. I am looking for a similar alternative but will probably replace with a double spot and some flourescent bulbs.
2,Think there are better choices out there.,I have several of these. Some last and some don't. I won't be buying any more of them. Better choices now at HomeDepot.
4,Keeping My Fingers Crossed!,"The first light I purchased did very well for 10 years. If memory serves, I had to change the bulb twice. I would have rated this product with five stars. It finally gave out and I purchased another one, had it installed by an electrician and waited for night fall. It never worked. Shipped it back and after a few prodding phone calls, finally received the new one. The same electrician installed the third light. It works perfectly so I've got my fingers crossed that this light lasts as long as the first one did."
1,Defective products,"Viking has so far twice sent me a defective module. I called their phone number to check the part number for my computer because Amazon doesn't clearly state which models work with which computers. However, the first module didn't fit into my computer. Amazon takes no responsibility for Viking's errors, so you must enter Viking's web site for returns. It took two web visits and a phone call to convince Viking to pay for the return shipping. The new memory finally arrived, and it was defective -- the computer only reads half of the memory, so the process starts again. I'd strongly recommend against Viking and against purchasing their products via Amazon."
4,Fooled by delayed start,I bought this to replace an earlier Lux model that had lasted for years. Installation was easy but I was fooled by the delayed start (wait 5 minutes) when turning on the AC. This seems to be a feature of modern thermostats but initially I thought something was wrong with the unit or install.The swing temperature also seems low so I went with the wide setting (Jumper 3 open).
2,works but very inacurate,"looks good and works if you dont mind temp swings of up to 8 degrees up and down.changed the swing settings and reset ,still varies room temp the 8 degrees from temp set"
1,It is huge disappoitment!,According to the picture on the website and the description (Sold by John Scott Kim)there should be a brand new cartridge with new pakaging. But the packaging design was not the same as described and the box was already opened and damaged. This was a huge disappointment and I will never purchase anything from this provider again.
5,Tarot For All,"This is one of the most appropriate tarot books for a novice. The special features are amazing, with history, types of tarot packs and their specialties, and the many uses other than divination. Each card is described beautifully with color pictures, meanings, and interpretations. While the new curious reader will benefit a lot out of this book, it is loaded with information of depth for a regular tarot practitioner, too.Very well-presented book."
2,"An interesting premise, but it doesn't deliver!","This intriging topic had me anxious to get into the book, but the book offered nothing new or really very interesting. I kept waiting for something new to reach out and grab me from the pages, but I was vry dissapointed.After I finished reading it, I felt like I had been fed a bit of fluff."
1,So bad I'm embarrassed to have read it...,"This is bad writing. I knew I was taking a risk when I picked up the book for $1 at a local book sale, and I'll admit early that I usually read nonfiction. If this is a sample of what I've been missing, giving me a dictionary over books like this anyday.The author took a storyline, filled in a few holes with typical crime-writing, and expected accolades for his creativity. Instead, upon finishing the book (an easy hour and a half read) one is left feeling the story was incredulous, light, and offensive to the memories of two victims and their families.It is a shameless ploy to gleen money from this tragedy, and I am embarrassed and ashamed that I wasted my time with it.This might very well be the worst book I have ever read."
3,So-so - the book was ok but not as deep as I had hoped,"The situations in the book are very simplistic and the advice is very straight forward. I wish it had applied to much deeper situations, and more complex and real situations that we face today. Overall, a good read but not cover to cover, I preused through it as I had time. Giving it a 3 stars."
4,Works quite well,"I purchased this wrist stabilizer because of pain in my wrist and arm due to typing. Although it is not the most attractive garment, it works quite well and has greatly reduced the discomfort I feel. At first I wore it all day at work, plus at night. Now I just wear it whenever I am typing. I have very little discomfort, and none of the terrible burning sensation that had been running from my wrist to my elbow. The only thing I don't like is the fit of the piece of material running between the thumb and first finger -- after wearing it for a while it starts to chafe."
4,Work well but not durable.,I've been using the Futuro Deluxe Wrist Stabilizer (both left & right hands) for 9 months. They have helped reduce the strain in my wrists and hands which is due to typing all day. The problem I'm having with them is that the Velcro which is used on the three straps is nearly worn out. The straps no longer want to grip and they often pop loose during normal use. Very soon they will be completely unusable. This may be a normal problem with all Velcro based straps; I don't know. These are my first wrist braces which use Velcro.
2,Low quality,"I've had this brace for about four days and the cushioning for the thumb is already ripped. the part that stabilizes the wrist is still intact, so far. I'm not loving it."
3,Meh,"I have larger forearms and small wrists. This did not work for me at all. This is really more a problem with me than the brace, but I want to let people know who may be in the same boat. If your forearms are a little meaty look for something else. This was way too loose in the wrist to be useful for me and when I tightened it enough to stabilize my wrist it cut into my arm painfully."
1,Very low quality - There is no warranty to the product,"This product is of a low quality, the metal insert will pierce the fabric after a month of use.There is no warranty to the product."
2,Lacks quality,"This product, sadly like many, is no longer made in the USA. My old one I replaced had a wonderful Made in the USA tag on it, this new one I bought did not. I've noticed a few differences in materials as well, and not in a good way. I probably would not have bought it if I realized they lowered their material quality and moved assembly out of the USA."
5,Futuro Deluxe Wrist,"This brace is excellent! I just purchased a new one; my last one lasted 3 years!I have a herniated disc in my neck, and diagnosed with ""cubicle"" & carpel tunnel. I'm so lucky!I wear it 24/7, I took the metal piece out and have flexibility to do almost anything. B/c of my condition my handwriting is not the best; I've actually lost some ability to handwrite. The brace will limit the way you hold a pen/pencil, etc., you just need to get used to it. Nevertheless, that shouldn't stop you from purchasing it.Anyway, it's a great brace, and I highly recommend it, I've tried many others (ACE in particular and returned them right away)."
5,Wrist Guard,"I gave this item to a friend, who was looking for a new one.,..it was too tight for me. She says it's helping a lot and feels great."
5,Abbado's conducting is wonderful,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I thoroughly enjoyed this performance. Abbado was wonderful in his conducting. The cast was solid and the singing quite good, even Placido Domingo who is not one of my favoite tenors. Judging from the applause at this live performance, the audience loved what they saw. Given the reasonable price, I wouldn't hesitate to add this to an opera collection."
2,A Visual Disappointment,"Domingo is a fine Lohengrin and the rest of the cast sing beautifully. They are also well complemented by Abbado and and the Vienna Philharmonic.But an opera is more than its music: It is also a drama. Those of us who purchase a DVD also expect -- and deserve a convincing production. And, unfortunately, this Lohengrin is not worth seeing. The staging is stilted and confined. The camera work is boring. Even the poor king's costume lacks regality."
3,Domingo singing Wagner? Don't you have ears?,"What a shame to waste such a great cast and conductor and the venue with a 'ticket selling' ITALIAN opera star, Domingo. Does anyone cares what his German sounds like? Has the world gone mad? Wanting to do something is not enough - I would like to conduct the Ring cycle in Bayreuth, but they won't let me. Is it enough that a major ITALIAN opera star has a minority complex of singing all those um-pa-pa trivia and pop songs with Iglesias (yes, don't you remeber) and switch into Helden-tenors? Beautiful singing, lovely voice - yes, but is that Lohengrin as Wagner wanted to be?..."
3,Songs are overproduced,"I've been wild about Jacques Brell since the 1970s, when a friend gave me an LP recording of the New York production of ""Jacques Brell Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris."" A single piano supported the singers. Voices and emotion came straight through -- nothing ersatz added. This recording of Jacques Brell was a long way from that kind of immediacy. Brell seemed bored, and the orchestra behind him offered a blur of sound that had no intrinsic interest for me."
4,Actual Listing,"I am unsure what other people have heard, but these are the actual contents.1. The Night Watchman (Chuck's first cartoon!)2. Old Glory (Porky Pig)3. Sniffles Takes a Trip (Sniffles)4. The Dover Boys5. My Favorite Duck (Daffy Duck/Porky)6. The Aristo-Cat (Hubie/Bertie/Proto-Claude Cat)7. Inki at the Circus (Inki)"
5,"""My Favorite Lies"" Offers Only Truth","Ann Beattie, watch out: you've got some serious competition. With razor-sharp wit and not a word wasted, Ruth Hamel deftly captures the quirks of ordinary people and in so doing makes them extraordinary--and fascinating. The prose in ""My Favorite Lies"" is so deliciously, audaciously precise that it makes you want to shout, leap up, and find someone to read these stories to. A friend who admires Hamel's talent as much as I do said that after reading ""My Favorite Lies,"" he found himself viewing the world through her lens. Succeeding in getting us to see in a new and different way: isn't that the definition of art? I'm eagerly awaiting more from this seriously gifted writer, and am shocked that a major publishing house hasn't yet grabbed her. Maybe they have by now--I hope so."
5,Great view into one person's lonely world,"I really like this book because it is a daily journal, with some memories of the good times in the past. Because it is truly the feelings of the day, it is very raw and real; it isn't somebody trying to remember at the end what it was like. It is well-written and the style and language are a pleasure to read.I would especially recommend it for anyone who is beginning the process of caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's. You will learn a lot about what you should do by reading about her experiences - keep in touch with others, don't keep your emotions bottled up, make sure you have support, and get help when you need it. Don't feel like you need to carry this burden on your own."
3,"Ok, but...","I've been using this for a while. Though the material is right, letters are very small, so B, O, R & Q won't come out easily. Usually I take a pointed but not sharp instrument and try to push it away, but most times it will just ruin the whole thing. If you have access to a larger Fondant Alphabet, I would recomend you to buy that one."
3,"Good quality, regular performance",I bought a mini alphabet set from another brand that turned out to be larger than this one! The quality of the material is good but some of the letters are not straight and tend to break easily. It is a good tool for small letters in fondant or gum paste.
3,b= bad!,"These letters are a good size to write phrases etc on cakes; however, I find B to be useless. I tried everything imaginable. I rolled fondant thick, I rolled it thin, I greased the B cutter and still the center gets stuck. Of course, that is the letter most needed since the caked are typically BIRTHDAY cakes."
2,Not what I expected,"In trying to play the role of awesome husband, I bought these for my wife since her babyshower is coming up and she wants to have an alphabet theme. I thought alphabet cookie cutters would be perfect. Unfortunately, as you'll find with most reviews, these things are tiny. They're far to small to be of any use as a cookie cutter, and realistically can only be used with fondant (A word that I had no idea what it meant until I got these) to make letters for cakes. Calling them ""cookie cutters"" is misleading. They do feel like they're of decent quality, but just be aware of what you're getting. The letters are about the width of my thumb."
3,Smaller than expected,"Perhaps I wasn't paying enough attention when I ordered these but the cutters are way smaller than I expected. They are literally 3/4 of an inch high and generally slightly less than that wide.Unfortunately the small size means the cut out part are really thin in places. So much so that for some letters it's all but impossible to get the cut out shape out in one piece. For example on a P, the upper bar is so thin that every one tore.Wilson used to make some 2"" cutters which worked well, and they do make 3"" ones both in metal and plastic. Unless you are really looking for small detailed letters, I would have to recommend either of those over these tiny ones."
3,Its okay,"I bought this in store and its a good size but its not really made the best. The joints show up (some worse then others) and can be hard to get rid of on a few of them. Some of the centers dont line up either. Some of the letters look different (width of the letters e.g.: like ""O"" and ""M"") so when they sit next to each other they dont look like they match.Overall not bad but just know you will have to do some work with the fondant after you cut them in order for it to look good and match in some cases."
3,cookie cutters,"I'm sure the size of these cookie cutter was in the description, but they are very very tiny. I gave to my daughter as a gift and am not sure if the cookie puffs up when used. Pretty small."
2,Most letters cannot be removed well enough to look presentable.,"I only gave these 2 stars because they do cut other things well (like cheese). But for these to be ""fondant"" cutters, they do a pretty shabby job. Knowing what I know now, I wish I never bought them."
3,"VERY small, but works","Sometimes the fondant gets stuck in some of the grooves because these are very small-- like only 1 inch tall. They do work, with some patience and a harder fondant."
1,Not what I thought,The alphabet cutters were much smaller than I anticipated. They were EXTREMELY hard to get the fondant out when cutting letters. I tried corn starch and powdered sugar.
4,Great for any occasion,These letters are good for fondant. I just wish I had a tool small enough to get the fondant out of the cutter that isn't a toothpick.
1,not happy,the letters were to small. the fondant was sticking the the letters. I was very unhappy with this. I will not be buying any thing else.
1,I can't do anything with theses things,Not happy with these at all! Not sure what the point is in having such small cookie cutters! I can't do anything with them so super disappointed.
5,Love born free,"I absolutley love this bottle . I have had avent dr browns , gerber , adiri,and playtex and this one is the best . For us it works just like a dr browns my son is colic and dr browns works the best for that . But you do not have to clean that middle part that I hate cleaning . I love the wide neck bottles they are my favs .The price ia a little too high though"
4,Use with Gerber NUK nipples,"These bottles are great for being BPA free, but they cause alot of collic without a better nipple than comes with the bottle.I've found that the Gerber NUK nipples work best!(YES...they fit) They are more like the breast, which the baby loves, and they are much easier on baby (she doesn't have to suck as hard, and she gets less air, which reduces her collic by a major amount).I would recommend if you can't see your self using any other bottle, try a Gerber NUK nipple, especially if you have a collicy baby!"
3,Glass version is better,We bought these plastic bottles because I broke our glass version of the same bottle. Slightly disappointed with the plastic considering how much we loved the glass ones. The ounce marks on the side aren't as clear as the glass and these bottles take forever to warm up.
4,"Great bottle, expensive though","This bottle is really great, the best actually.I bought 1 of each bottle on the market to try on the baby...Avent, Dr. Browns, etc.The baby eats about 8x a day so we bought 32 bottles to have a 4 day supply before running the dishwasher, so even though we liked this one the best we went with the Dr. Browns just based on price because it was just about as good, only with a lot more parts. If you need less bottles than us or don't mind paying a little more, go with these!"
4,I buy these again.,"These are particularly good if you use formula. Also, all the plastic can survive being boiled. It's important to use the correct size nipple, which are readily available.My complaints are that I can't find replacement internal plastic parts if one is lost or destroyed (for example on the dishwasher burner). The other is that they are just plain expensive. The quality is good but it's expensive."
2,bad customer service,"I did not have any leaking problems with these bottles as long as I used the valves and nippleas they provide. The problems started when I wanted to replace valves and I can't buy them and I do not get any reply to the messages I send to their customer service. I started to use Avent nipples with the bottles and it is leaking while I shake the bottle to mix the formula. While the baby is feeding, there is very little leak.Born Free would have a great product if theie customers service would be more helpful and if they would use Avent type nipples. I don't understand why they won't sell parts."
2,Lots of annoyances,"I felt a little trapped into buying these since there are not that many BPA free options. I quickly figured out that they leak really badly unless you buy the inserts. Bottles that leak are miserable as the last thing you want to be doing- while exhausted at 3:00 am is dealing with leaky bottles. Gets all over the baby and then you have to change them, waking everyone up more.... miserable. They worked fine for me after I figured that out but that is not acceptable for such an expensive bottle. I also am annoyed to have to clean the extra parts for absolutely no extra benefit. Very dissappointed. I used Avent bottles for my first and if they had a BPA free option I would do that first. Maybe they will soon!"
1,Too many pieces,"I have several different bottles and sippy cups that are BPA free. I will not buy Born Free again. It works just fine but there are just too many piece to put together. My husband gave it to the baby wrong mulitiple times because he didn't realize that you needed the base, the nipple, plus 2 other pieces that go inside the bottle. I opt for Thinkbaby instead. It only has a bottle and nipple but it's still BPA free"
2,A parody of bad design,"Way too many parts to these bottles, and all need to be handwashed. Lots of bottles are BPA-free now and all the ones we tried were easier to use than these. We ended up using Medela bottles because it was easy to work with the breast pump parts."
1,Poorly constructed,bottle is too expensive. The venting system is also useless. The flow of the nipple is way too fast as my daughter has choked several times while feeding from this bottle.Dr.Brown's bottles are a much better product and are much less expensive than the Born Free.
2,Dr. Brown is way better,"I wish I had believed the negative review before I purchased these bottles. Their venting system is not good. I can see lots of bubbles come out when my baby takes his milk. The worst part is when I first screw the nipple on, and test the milk flow, the milk will actually gush straight out, which could potentially choke my baby. I have to unscrew them, and then tight the top part again. Do it at least three times. You can imagine there is no fun doing this with a hungry baby in your arms crying for food. In fact, my baby got mad so many times with these bottles that I have to stop using them. Dr. Brown is way way better, although it is not BPA free. I am not sure about BPA part, but I am sure my baby does not like these ""Born free"" bottles."
3,Unsanitary yet BPA free...,"I just bought one of these and threw out all of my Soothie's and Playtex bottles because of the whole BPA thing. My son is 13 months, I breastfed for 7 then started supplementing. Now we're here, budget wise I bought one.Here's the deal, the nipple is super soft, no it didn't cause problems with him getting the milk out, I even gave him pediasure and he drank all eight ounces from this bottle, however after he drank the strawberry pediasure I tried to wash it. I soaked it, boiled it, re-washed it and boiled it again, I could not get the strawberry smell out of it, so I don't know how sanitary that makes it. Obviously the glass bottle was fine, even the white piece, but the super soft nipple wreaks of strawberry after one sitting with pediasure. I am not so impressed, but I don't know what other options there really are, especially since it isn't the bottle itself, just the nipple that is the problem."
3,"Great at first, but...","I switched my son from Dr. Brown's bottles to these Born Free ones, after learning about the BPA in Dr. Brown's. At first, these bottles were great! My son made a very easy transition from the Dr. Brown's to these. After about 1 1/2 months of use, my daycare provider started having problems with the nipples collapsing. I have tried everything from making sure the collar isn't too tight, to looking closely at the slit in the venting system. I can't seem to figure out what is going wrong. It doesn't happen all the time...just periodically. I emailed Born Free over 3 weeks ago and I haven't heard back (not very good customer service if you ask me). Overall, I am glad I am feeding my son out of BPA free bottles, but I wish the nipples wouldn't collapse."
2,Safe Plastic??????,"They don't leach, but they could be melting into your baby's food.These bottles developed hot spot bubbles in the plastic that looked as if it had been set up against a hot pot and were worse inside. This was a result of just microwaving! I don't get it. I did switch to glass but an additional complaint is that when the nipples get warm (from the milk, not heated with bottle) they get so soft that the milk shoots like a fire hose. If I'm lucky enough to get it in her mouth before spraying her, she is nearly drowning. The sippy cup is the worse, she has an easier time drinking out of an adult cup."
2,higly overrated,"I've had these bottles for almost a year now and know everything about them.- They are solidly constructed of good materials and last- They are annoying clean because they have five parts and are difficult to disassemble.- They are annoying to assemble because they have five parts, and if you don't take care putting the bottle together just so...- They LEAK!If you don't get everything *just right* then the bottles LEAK. They leak upside down on the baby, right side up to leave rings on tables, and in general are just a total mess. Just think of how often you're going to be holding the baby in one hand and trying to assemble the bottle with the other hand, at 2am in the dark of night, with no sleep for the past week."
5,Great bottles!,"My six month old has been using these bottles since he was about 4 weeks old. We were using Avent and Dr. Brown bottles but heard about these that are BPA free. Yes they cost more but we would rather feel more secure in knowing that they won't leak anything harmful (possibly) into our baby's body. We have not had any problems with them and we have quite a few. We have both the 5oz and the 9oz as well as the glass ones (we got those accidentally but they are also good, just too heavy for now) and when we have had a leaking problem all you do is untwist them and twist them again and you are good. Excellent bottles. And our son does not have any more or less gas than he did with the Dr. Brown bottles. Avent was not a favorite although it does seem to be very popular. Of course if they were BPA free I might think they were ""okay"" but threw all of the ones we had away. Also we have the Avent bottle warmer and the Born Free bottles fit perfectly."
4,Nice Wide Nipple BPA Free!,"I really like this bottle...it has the two things I was looking for....it's BPA free and has a wide nipple. We actually started out using the Adiri bottle....my LO liked it for a while then suddenly started to refuse it. We then tried this one and I'm so pleased that he will take it without a problem! I like it even better than the Adiri because we can use it in the bottle warmer (the adiri bottle leaked). The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because there are SO many pieces. It's a little inconvenient, but totally worth it for a good BPA free plastic bottle."
4,safe baby bottles,I am very pleased w/the born free bottles & nipples. And very relieved to find a safe bottle for my baby. the bottles work fine & don't leak like the avent bottles.
5,Great bottles!,"We've used these bottles from the beginning. We bought them because they are BPA free, which is VERY important to us. Our baby is mostly breastfed, but we have used these before bed and when he goes to grandma's house. We've not had problems with the nipple collapsing and we like the little back flow mechanism, as he doesn't seem to get any more gas than he does when breast feeding. We've also tried the Evenflow glass bottles (he wouldn't take the nipple at all) and the Green to Grow Bottles (he also didn't like the nipple). My guess is that babies like whatever type of nipple that they've gotten used to having in their bottle. We've just had the problem with the nipples breaking down in a few bottles, but if you read the literature, it says the silicone nipples should be replaced every few months (this is true for nipples on bottles & pacifiers a like). At 5 months we should be using a faster flow nipple any way, so we are just going to buy the next level nipple."
4,"Great, but a pain to wash","I think these bottles are great. I just hate washing all the parts. I suppose it is no different than Dr. Brown's or similar bottles with parts, just not as easy as the Avent we came from. The safe plastic is worth the hassle to me. Also, the number 1 nipple is very slow which works great for a newborn."
3,"Safer plastic, but not any better overall","I really wanted to like these bottles and while I am glad the plastic is safer, I don't think the construction (i.e. revolutionary valve system) is any better than other bottles. In fact, there seem to be more air bubbles in this bottle than my other BreastFlow bottles. The nipple is soft which is a plus.I would say the only benefit is the lack of chemicals. Aside from that, there are no new advantages."
3,Why do these come up under glass bottles?,"I purchased these thinking they were the glass ones (they come up under ""glass baby bottle"" when searched) so without really reading I assumed they were glass since they came up under the search for glass baby bottles. So for those of you who did the same, these are not glass."
1,nipples do not have holes,"Have used Born Free bottles in the past and were always well pleased. These bottles purchased from Amazon are not of great quality, three of the six nipples that came with the bottles did not have holes in them. What a disappointment for Mom and baby."
2,WARNING!!! Leaks after one year!,"I have many Born-Free bottles and after one year, I've noticed that over half of them (about 7-8 bottles) have started leaking. When I took the bottle apart to find the cause, I noticed that the rubber part of the ventilation system was torn. I've always carefully washed the bottles with a bottle brush after soaking them. I knew that it wasn't from mishandling them. I called Born-Free and they told me that it's common for that to happen after a year and that they could send me a one-time replacement of two vents, but I would have to pay the shipping and handling. Really? For a $10 bottle? I told them that for $10 I would expect to be buying a quality bottle and that I'll be buying a 3 pack of Dr. Brown's BPA Free bottles for $10 instead of paying $6.99 for each 2 pack of replacement vents. At the time that I had my daughter, Born-Free was the only BPA free bottle with a ventilation system and I feel that they took advantage of that with concerned parents."
3,Bottles are a hassle.,"I got these bottles because my daughter wanted them for my grandson. They seem good, but all the pieces are a pain to assemble and clean. They are also quite expensive. Hope they help reduce gas."
5,Favorite Bottles,"I love these bottles. I started off using Born Free glass bottles and then bought a few plastic ones for traveling. I've noticed that my baby now 3-1/2 months, is starting to use his hands to either hold onto or try to move the bottle away. Therefore, I'm opting for plastic Born Bottles right now. The 9oz will last a long time. My baby is drinking about 4oz right now. As for hand washing all the parts, you'll get use to it as time goes by. It's part of my nightly routine now."
1,If the bottle is upside down or on its side baby is soaked,"Awful. The people that are saying these dont leak are talking about the bottle itself not leaking from the neck, us with older babies that hold their bottle and throw an shake and hold upside down--- these are the worst. Like a faucet dripping. Ill stick to my $5 nuby no drips"
2,baby bottles,Not to good for infants :(good for 6 months up :( to many pieces to wash and it leaks :(
2,Am I doing something wrong?,"Ok, I just brought the born free BPA-free plastic bottles and I made sure that the slit was open before feeding, that there was no space between the venting system, and that it was over tightening the nipple and I was very disappointed & irritated that the bottle did leak!! whats going on!!"
2,Leaky bottles and collapsing nipples,"I've been using born free bottles (glass and plastic) for 8 months now. When I first started, I noticed that the nipples would collapse at every feeding. I emailed the born free customer service and they told me that the silicone venting slit can stick together when sterilized. They recommended that I massage open the slit when putting the bottle together. This worked 50% of the time. When the bottle collapsed during feeding, I would have to unscrew the bottle and let air enter. After using them for some time, the nipples no longer collapsed but the bottles started leaking. It seems to me that the silicone venting system needs to be replaced every few months. I bought new silicone vents and they're not leaking now. I'm not going to buy another brand because I already invested so much money in these bottles. If I had to choose again, I would not buy born free again."
1,Nipple Collapse,"I am very disappointed in these bottles. After reading reviews, they seemed like the best option for BPA free bottles. At first they worked ok with my newborn, but after less than 2 weeks nearly every nipple collapses during feedings, and my baby keeps on sucking in more air - you can actually hear her sucking in air. She gets very gassy and uncomfortable after feedings and I blame it mainly on these bottles and nipples. I switched to the new Dr. Browns BPA free bottles and they seem so be working great so far -- AND they are not as expensive as the Born Free. Some people seem to love the Born Free bottles, just didn't work for us. Good luck!!"
2,Disappointing to say the least!,"I bought these Born Free bottles and nipples, switching away from Avent, mainly b/c of they are bpa-free. The Born Free bottles and nipples are so diappointing in every way. First of all, they are harder to clean (extra 2 piece valve). The bottles leak from the screw on neck. The nipples collapse consistently. Nothing could be more frustrating than dealing with these product issues when you have a hungry baby to feed. Finally, I switched back to the Avent nipples which work on these bottles. If you do buy this product, DON'T invest in the nipples- just use Avent nipples. I am sorry I invested so much $$ in this system..and would just like to warn others on the disappinting performance."
3,"BPA-free, but little else to recommend it","Yes, it is BPA free, one of only two plastic bottles on the market we've found as of today. [The other is ones made by Medela.] But that's about all these bottles have going for them.* The are expensive, as everyone else also noted.* They are a pain to clean. It comes apart into 5 parts that need to be cleaned.* I've heard they are not microwave safe (using the microwave sterilizer bags).* The ""anti-gas"" feature doesn't work as well as other brands'.* It stains easily, for example by iron supplements.* There is no bent version.Would I buy them again? Yes, as they are still the best BPA-free bottles available now. But I look forward to other companies coming out with better designs soon!"
3,Company doesn't back its product,"We bought 18 bottle sets for our newborn twins. We are down to 10 collars and we can't find replacement ones without spending a mint on replacing the entire set. They don't respond to e-mails. If we don't tighten the caps down, they leak. If we over tighten, they break. I would not recommend this product."
2,BPA Free but poor design. Better BPA-free options if you look,"My wife bought a bunch because they were (for a time) the only BPA-free bottles she found (frankly didn't look that hard)They are decent bottles yes, but there is this extra pair of pieces which you have to assemble. I don't see that they do anything for reducing swallowed air or anything else, but they're fidgety and just extra pieces to clean.It might not sound so bad but it more than doubles the amount of work to fill a bottle, and at 3 AM when you have a screaming baby, you don't want to be diddling around with the extra pieces.BE WARNED - Replacement nipples are $7.50 a pair and they last only a month or two before they need to be replaced (The holes enlarge and let too much flow out) There are MUCH CHEAPER and simpler / better designed bottles out there - you just have to look.The sippy cups are another story entirely. They are a disaster."
1,Leaks like crazy and has annoying extra parts,"These bottles, which are obviously selling well because of the Bisphenol-A issues, leak like crazy. All you have to do is tip the bottle sideways and the milk comes gushing out like crazy. Makes a huge and annoying sticky mess. My advice, if you must absolutely have these, is to use the Avent nipples on these bottles. They fit and they don't leak at all, even upside-down. The silicone nipple is not implicated in the Bisphenol problems. The Born Free bottles also have a silicone gasket and a plastic insert, making cleaning and filling the bottles very frustrating and unnecessarily complex. I am hoping someone else comes up with a better BSA-free bottle because these are just not working for me."
3,Bpa-free...yeah! Vent & nipples...boo!,"I bought these because they are bpa-free. The vent is just one more piece to wash and keep track of, so I removed it. The nipples collapsed for me also (because I'm not using the vent, I guess). I use the Avent nipples instead and the bottle works fine."
2,Not Impressed,"With my first child I used Avent bottles, but decided to go with Born Free for the second. I was holding a grudge against Avent as I purchased them in the past believing they were BPA free when they weren't. I wanted to support Born Free as Avent has been slow to jump on the BPA free bandwagon. Now that Avent does make a BPA free line I am letting the grudge go and switching back. My daughter has been using the Born Free bottles for the first three weeks of her life. She doesn't seem to be able to latch on to the nipple very well. She makes a loud smacking sound with every suck which leads me to think she is taking in a lot of air. Now it seems she may be having some nipple confusion as she is having a tough time latching on while breastfeeding and isn't creating a good seal. She was doing fine, but it seems that the more bottles she gets, the tougher it is becoming for her to latch on to the breast. Also, the Avent bottles are smaller and more comfortable to feed with."
1,Poor Customer Service,"I ordered these directly from the company and to their credit, they delivered them very quickly. However, my son would not change to the new nipple, so I followed their directions to return my order. I have emailed them twice and they are ignoring me. They have very poor customer service -- be aware!"
4,"Much safer, but not as easy to use","At the moment these appear to be the only bottles, other than glass, that don't also poison your children with the estrogen-like substances (bisphenol) found in Avent and other plastic bottles. But the design isn't as good as Avent, and they tend to leak unless kept completely upright. It's a fair price to pay, but it's a shame that they didn't deal with the leaking problem as well."
1,DO NOT DROP,My baby dropped 3 of these bottle on the floor and they cracked open. For what they cost you would think they would be a little stonger. I e-mailed the mfg twice and still have had no response.
2,Expensive and parts breaking,"We were very happy with our Dr. Brown's bottles. But we switched to Born Free after learning about the bisphenol-A scare. We used the BF bottles for 2 months with no problem but now the silicone vent is broken. The middle tip of the vent (the part that points downward) somehow has a slit in it. This makes the nipple collapse and frustrates the baby. So far, I cannot find replacement vents. We'll likely return to the Dr. Brown's bottles. These were too expensive to break after only 2 months. I would not recommend these until the replacement parts become available."
5,Born free,My dr suggested these bottles should be used when the baby is after 4month old due to the size and the air that baby is drawing from it.
4,Great Bottle,"My daughter had the 5 oz bottles, but now she's drinking more, so I had to order the bigger ones. The nipples work great for her because they aren't too big and we never have any leaking."
1,Guaranteed to leak after a while,"I was very happy to initially find these (despite $10 price tag per bottle -- outrageous!). We bought 2 plastic ones, two glass ones, and several trainer/sippy cups. After a while, all bottles were leaking! It does not leak all the time, but about 8 out of 10. We always bring the bottles with a paper towel wrapped around the neck, because it's almost certain it will leak. Hugely disappointing, and of course the customer service, as per other reviews, is terrible. They suggested we were overtightening the bottle, which we were not and continued to experiment with every combination of tightness, part combination, etc. It's very telling if ALL of their models leak, and alll 6 bottles -- obviously it's not a one off case.I hope they have improved their design in the meantime. Luckily other choices are available now, and I am sure to stay away from these!"
4,Not too bad!,"I traded in my Avent bottles for Born Free after the huge BPA news stories. I don't think I would have paid for them if I had to buy them all brand new at once, but since I was getting credit, I decided to try them.I don't think the one extra valve piece is really that big of a deal - they're still less complicated than Dr. Brown's! I haven't had any leaking problems or melting problems (even in the dishwasher). I did have one crack when my daughter dropped it on a tile floor. I was lucky enough to be able to exchange it, but I would like them to be a little more sturdy -- especially now that my daughter is old enough to throw things she doesn't want! :)Overall, I'm happy I made the decision to switch, and they've worked fine for our family. But $8-$10 a bottle? Seriously?"
3,Not Perfect,"I bought these bottles because they were BPA free. They leak and the nipple tends to collapse. The ""vent"" system means there are two additional pieces to the bottle. I have used the avent nipples with the bottles and with and without the vent system. They still sometimes leak."
4,Great Bottle,I bought these bottles because of the BPA issue. I was using Dr. Brown bottles which I thought were great. Some of the other reviews complained about missing their Dr. Brown Bottles but I think the Born Free are the same bottle in a different wrapper. I use the Dr. Brown inserts and nipples and they work perfect. The reason why I did not give this a 5 star is because just like Dr. Brown Bottles there are many parts to clean.
2,Disappointing,"After researching baby products, this came to the top of my list as it is BPA free. I also liked the concept of reduced pressure in the bottle from the venting system.Sadly, these bottles leak... a lot. They tell you not to tighten them too much or you lose the ""venting"" benefit. I'm a big guy and I really have to crank them down to prevent leakage. Then, I notice that my 2 month old son cannot seem to get milk out of them like he can from a standard no-frills Medela bottle. I tried them a month ago and thought to try them again. Leaking... reduced milk flow, all the same problems.This is a very disappointing product. I love the BPA free concept but if you can't use the bottle, what's the sense. It makes for a fancy storage container. The venting concept is also great... if it actually worked."
1,Didn't work out,"I liked these bottles initially because of the design and being bpa-free. However, my baby could not nurse with them because the nipples are so soft that they kept collapsing, which caused all kinds of problems and frustrations for our baby and us. I am upset I spent so much money and couldn't use them."
3,Nipple collapsing issue,"Like the bottle that it is bisphenol A free and it looks and feel like the Dr. Brown wide neck bottles we have been using. However, we had repeated issues with nipples collapsing, which frustrates both baby and mom. We contacted Born Free about the issue, and they were very responsive. We tried their suggestions to remedy the issue (made sure the vent system is assembled correctly), however, the nipple collapsing issue still occurs periodically. I think the vent system on some of our bottles are just defective. I gave up trying to make the Born Free vent work, and just replaced the Born Free vent with the Dr. Brown parts, and it has been working great after that."
2,I miss my Dr. Brown's bottles!,"We threw away all of our Dr. Brown bottles because of the BPA problem announced on the Baby Bargains website and swtiched to these at their suggestion.These bottles are a big step down from Dr. Browns in every way except for the BPA-free feature. There are more air bubbles, they are wider than the standard size Dr. Brown bottles which makes it difficult for my baby to hold them, they are harder to clean, and for us the biggest problem has been that the nipples collapse all the time. This is frustrating because nipple-collapse avoidance is mentioned in most of their on-line product descriptions!My son hates these bottles. He's developed a gas problem he never used to have and cries during feedings when the nipple collapses. I'm about to invest yet again in a new set of BPA-free bottles. Wish me luck."
5,Great product,"These bottles are great. I purchased them because they are BPA free. I have also used Medela, Advent, and Dr. Browns. The Born Free are by far the best. The wide neck makes adding formula easy. I haven't had any problems with leaking or a collapsed nipple as other posts mention. In fact, I am able to shake them to mix the formula w/o any spilling which I have found is impossible with the Dr. Brown bottles. My son seems to prefer the nipple shape of the Born free to the other brands as well and is less gassy than when we use the Medela or Advent. I am very satisfied. The only downside is currently the company is out of stock on their venting system so you only get one venting system per three pack of bottles and have to redeem a free coupon to get the other two vents. I had a bunch from the smaller 5 oz bottles I bought so I was able to use those with the new 9 oz bottles I purchased until I get the new ones. I highly recommend these bottles."
4,DON'T LEAK,"These bottles DON'T LEAK!! I love these bottles, we went through 4 different bottles before finding this one. everyone had a diffrent suggestion on what you need to use and why and it all doesn't matter it is going to be what works for your baby.The only thing i dont like about these bottles is the Price if u catch them on a sale there not bad, but i still think they are a little expensive."
5,Great product!,This is a great bottle! It's a slow flow nipple and our child is hardly spitting up at all. Very durable as well!
3,Still not sure,"At first these bottles seemed like a godsend. Our baby had struggled with Avent and Adiri brands. The soft nipple seemed like a really good design and feedings went really smoothly and quickly. She seems to be slowing down a bit now despite using the #2 nipple and we have yet to try the #3s (which I think would be too advanced for a 5 week old)so I guess the jury is sill out. They don't leak and are easy to clean. Overall though at this point I would say these are very good quality, well designed bottles."
4,"Good bottle, easy to clean",Bought it for two months. Good performance. Worked well for baby-feeding. Very easy to clean.The only shorts is the vending system. Sometines baby felt difficult to suck out milk.
1,The company lowered its standards,"I have been using these bottles for the past 18 months. We had 3 glass bottles, 2 of them cracked in the milk warmer machine, the third one is still good and not leaking.Then I bought 4 more plastic bottles, 2 from Target and 2 from the local grocery store. All these 4 bottles leak right now. The 2 from target started leaking after one month of usage, the other two right away. I feed the baby and then I stop half-way through and I put the bottle down on the coffee table/couch and the next time I pick it up there is milk everywhere around the bottle. I opened the cap and there is milk inside the cap, between the thread lines. These will be the last bottles I buy from this company."
3,bpa free but leaky somtimes,"I've used Avent for my first two kids (4 and 2.5, who still enjoy one bottle of milk per day) and with all the hype, I decided to try out Born Free for #3 due soon. Perhaps I just ended up with a faulty part (the plastic part that screws over the nipple), but it leaks every time (not the other one). I did use only Avent nipples because the Born Free were just too collapsible for my kids. With four plus years of bottle experience, I know how to remedy a leaky bottle, but this one just won't be championed.Since I can't return it for a refund, I'll keep the one ring for the two bottles.Due to that frustration, I researched other bottles and decided to go with Evenflo glass bottles. No worries about plastics leaching into the milk and storage in glass seems to last longer (I nurse and pump--I produce a lot of milk, so I need lots of storage, no formula for me)."
3,"quality bottle, but didn't work for our baby","Due to Bisphenol A we tried switching from normal (not wide-mouthed) Dr. Brown's bottles to these. They were solid, well-made (and expensive). Sadly, our son couldn't handle the wide-mouth nipple--he dribbled everywhere and eventually got frustrated. It was unclear from their website (where we ordered the bottles directly) that all of their products were wide-mouthed (amazon.com is much clearer about this). We ended up giving the bottles away to a neighbor. I wish they made standard glass bottles, as the venting system was very good on these--on par with Dr. Brown's."
4,Read the cleaning instructions,"I used these for a year with my son and was really happy. The only issue one might have is the number of parts to wash.I also failed to read directions properly and didn't realize the that one part was really two...having never separated this piece that goes in between the bottle and nipple, I didn't realize I was supposed to take it apart and wash it until I noticed mold in one!"
3,Very bad silicone nipples,The bottles and their system are good but the problem with this product is the silicone nipples! TOO long and it is difficult for the baby to eat.
2,It leaks and does not vent well. Wish Advent makes a BPA free bottle.,"The only reason we got this is for BPA free. It is complicated with many parts to clean. It does not vent when you screw the nipple on too tight. However if you let it loose, it leaks!!! We think we are pretty good at fixed things, but these are hard to use compare to Advant bottles.It will take Advent nipples, but it will leaks too. However Advent nipples vents much better. If only Avant makes BPA free bottle, we will swiych back in a second. It did not get one start becasue of the BPA:("
2,Nipple collapses all the time!,"I just got this bottle because they are BPA free, my son like his milk warm. The problem I have is that the nipples collapse all the time, I use th Y nipple. I love the Avent bottle ant now they have BPA free bottles that you can combine with your old nipples. BornFree nipples are very expensive. I have tried everything and I think Avent is just the best. Dr. Browns are difficult to clean and time consuming to assemble. Avent is simple , nipples never collapse, and those who say that they leak it's because they are not closing it properly. Mine have never leaked. I also was very disappointed because I bought a 9oz three pack and when I got them there was only one vent valve included for 3 bottles. I have a coupon to get the other 2 vent systems for ""free"". Why would they not include it in the package? I have been at the store to redeem the coupon and they are always out."
2,Just ok,"I bought these bottles to replace our Avent bottles, due to BPA concerns. These bottles are ok, but I like Dr. Brown's better. I use a Medela breast pump and the Born-Free bottles, like the Avent bottles, do not fit on the pump. The Dr. Brown's bottles do fit the Medela pump connectors. Like other reviewers have stated, the nipples on these bottles collapses and there are extra parts that seem useless, just more stuff to clean. It is easier for my son to hold the Dr. Brown's bottles also. I would not recommend these, there are far better bottles out there, we also use Momo glass bottles, and I am very pleased with them."
3,so complicated...,"I was hoping to replace my Avent bottles, and based on several reviews, I chose Born Free. First off, in case you're wondering, it is not compatible with Avent nipples, lids, sealing discs like several reviews said. That aside, what really got to me was the complicated pieces, each bottle has a ""valve"" piece that consists of two parts. That plus the nipple and ring and cap, it is a 6-part bottle!It is just way too much to take apart, clean by hand, and put back together. The valve doesn't seem to have any real impact, but my baby has never had ""colic"" problems with any bottle.I sent the bottles back and bought ThinkBaby. They are so much better, the plastic seems more durable, the look is nicer, and they are cheaper and of course no BPA, lead, etc. Try ThinkBaby... oh, but keep in mind the flow of the ""slow"" nipples are way fast before you go buy a fast-flow."
4,BPA free - That's why I bought them,"I bought these Bornfree glass bottles after being told by my cousin that Avent bottles are leaching BPA to the baby's milk when they are heated.My baby did not have any problem switching from Avent to these ones. After the first week, one of the bottle's neck broke. That disappointed me a bit cos they cost dearly. Cost me 15 euro for each bottle (cos I had to order them from the UK - the shipping charge is a bit robbing).The nipples do collapse when the venting system is not put correctly. My baby still has gas.One of the good thing about them is they don't have the afterwash smell of detergent that you use to wash them. Avents bottles smell of washing liquid even after I rinsed them very well.Overall I am happy with these bottles. I would recommend them to my friends"
3,Mediocre bottle,"Been comparing Avent, Nuby, Medela, Adiri, etc. for our little baby.Nothing wrong with this bottle, but nothing outstanding either.Likes:- Glass. Nice and easy to clean and worry free for me (vs. plastic, even BPA free plastic)Dislikes:- So many finicky pieces for no obvious reason. It has that silly slow flow valve, which is 2 piece, requires cleaning and doesn't seem to work any better than the other bottles- The flow rate is medium, even for the new born. It's not the fastest, but I would like slower, to mimic breast flow.- Glad to see the volume markings have changed. On the set I have, it is merely part of the glass, no print, and it is very difficult to read if milk has run up the side or if condensation occurs.Would get again if they could have a less complicated system. The Avent bottles work better and are simpler."
1,"Expensive, Expensive- not worth the money","I was using Avent for my daughter until the whole BPA issue came up.. bought a couple of born free bottles.. Its the most expensive and they come only with stage 1 nipples.. the extra nipples are $7 a pack.. so over all we need to spend about $14 per bottle. After all this, the nipples start collapsing just around the 8 week mark and so have to be replaced.. They must be kidding! I contacted their customer service and did not recieve a response.. well we finally ended up buying playtex nurser which is only 1/3 of the cost.. I switched and my daughter is doing fine..so, I would say think twice before investing in this bottle!"
5,Safest bottles,We love these bottles! They are bpa-free which makes us feel better about heating the milk in the bottle.
2,Durability a disappoitment,"We bought a bunch of bottles and sippy cups from this company due to our concerns about the potentially harmful chemicals found in ordinary bottles. After less than two months many of the bottles have broken or are useless due to ripped nipples. If a toddler drops a full or partially full bottle/sippy, particularly from the height of being held by a standing adult, you can count on the bottle/sippy cracking open. Not only do the bottles crack easily, but the bottle nipples rip easily too. This makes the rest of the unit useless until you spend more money and time replacing the nipple. These bottles are probably fine for infants, but they have not endured the test of toddlers in my house. They do not demonstrate the durability of the standard plastic."
4,great lyrics,Great CD to listen all the way from start to finish. Went to a Dave Matthews show and Ray opened up for them. They were great live and the CD is great too. I recommend it to people who like Dave.
3,Good History,If you need to know old places to metal detect this may be the book for you? I haven't gone yet though.
3,The Rewiew About The Fashion Angels Note Box,"This item is okay.Everything was smaller than I expected. The gel pens are regular,and they work great.A very good thing about this item is that there are pictures on the side.Also there is this sort of clear paper over the pictures on the side of the box so if something spilled on that part of the box you could just wipe it off.But one bad thing about the item is that when it first arrived in the mail I touched one of the things on the bottom and it fell off.I used craft glue to fix it,but it took twelve hours too dry."
4,"Lonely Planet ""After Yugoslavia","An interesting insight comparing the countries of former Yugoslavia in the late 90's with the authoor's experience 20 years previously. It is beneficial to read this book in association with a recent edition of Lonely Planet ""Western Balkans"". This gives an on-going view of developments in these countries, and provides maps and photos, which are sadly lacking from Zoe Bran's book."
5,A must see documentary,"It touched me. I could only think of all the young men and women who have died due to gang activity, all the lives lost and families hurt for no reason. This documentary really shows what others fail to elaborate on; you get to see the before and after to a series of tragedies and events taking place in South Los Angeles. Reminded me of all that still needs to be changed. I commend the film's creator for not just sitting back, observing and complaining about the situation of things in South Los Angeles (like so many others do), but instead taking the time to document and depict the story for the world to see."
5,Nice,Worked out well. Replaced the old one. Had the same one before. Gave use good service in the past. Would buy again
1,BE CAREFUL BUYING THIS ITEM (OUT OF DATE),I have purchased two of these lights and each time after about 2 years the lens separates from the aluminium housing and falls off and breaks. Cooper does not offer replacement lens and therefore you have to buy another whole fixture at full price. I would recommend that you not buy any Cooper products like this with the aluminium housing and plastic lens and they all are subject to this failure mode. NOT ANYMORE. COOPER IS MAKING THESE HOUSINGS AVAILABLE AT A VERY REASONABLE PRICE.... WOW! WHAT A GREAT COMPANY. THEY HEARD ME AND DID SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I AM IMPRESSED.
3,Made in China,What isn't made in China? No doubt I'll be replacing it with antoher Made In China version in a year or two.
2,Too big and clunky for me...,"I think Mobile Edge makes a nice product which is why I bought this case. But I was disappointed when I received it because it just looked and felt like it was too big and clunky for my new 15.6"" Dell. Even for its size, I was surprised that my basic laptop accessories didn't seem to easily fit in the available compartments. I decided to return the case and see if I could find something that fit what I was looking for more closely."
5,Wow - excellent bag!,"Expected less - got more! This is the perfect bag for the price, great quality and perfect compartments! It is easy to store all the right stuff and easy to stow under seat or overhead in the plane!"
5,Inspirational,I found To Be A Woman to be extremely well written and insightful. I was absolutely captivated by the author's fresh perspective on the feminine condition. I highly recommend thisbook to any woman seeking self-understanding.
5,What a package,"These speakers really have made me enjoy my music alot more. I used to have a 2.1 speaker system that had came with my computer, and the bass just wasn't what it should be. So i decided to go and buy these. The sound quality of the voices is so much clearer and crisper. Not to mention the subwoofer is the size of a 15 inch t.v it delivers amazing bass. i've even used these speakers to play on my xbox, since it comes with an adapter to use on tv's and such. There isn't many speakers out here that can cost this little and give such good quality. I highly recommend these speakers if you are going to use them for gaming on your computer. It gives you such a different effect, i even mounted the back two to my ceiling since they are able to rotate and have holes for you to mount them."
2,"good, but....the subwoofer doesn't work for me anymore","this worked perfect for 1 week, and i really mean perfect, after just 1 week of playing the subwoofer stopped working... and now i think i need to buy another one , maybe i was unlucky or somethin...but the subwoofer doesn't work for me anymore"
3,Speakers Go Out,I've had my Z-5300 for less than a year and I have had two speakers that have gone out on me and I never crank up the volume. My next computer speakers system will not be from Logitech.
1,Poor design,"I'm surpised by all the high reviews of this product. The speakers are pretty nice, but I think the design is horrible. The wired remote is poorly designed, ugly and well, wired.My center speaker arrived defective -- lots of static.My biggest gripe was with the subwoofer. There is simply no way to turn this thing down. The remote supposedly gives you a way to turn it down, but even at the lowest setting it is very loud -- too loud for me, or rather too loud for my neighbors.Long story, short: speakers - decent, wired remote - bad, quality - defective, subwoofer - uncontrollable.I would not recommend this product to anyone. If I had seen the remote in a store, I never would have bough the system."
4,All Good,"i like all of these - but i don't understand why only some of them are available? why just have some on dvd. There are a bunch of other titles - where are they? why would hallmark just release a few of them; it's been quite awhile since they showed them, so holding onto them so long just means more people who would buy them, will forget about them."
5,WOW!!,"Legendary quality, durability design and function, seemingly indestructable. A bit heavy but unparallelld in quality. This tool is truley unbelievable and probably overbuilt for its use - which is refreshing in a tool I bought to use."
3,Good tool if money is no object.,"The tool comes with three attachments, a triangular detail sander, a spatula like tool, which they say, is a scraper (limited usefulness) and a worthless saw blade. The saw blade is only meant to cut soft wood and is made of soft metal. If you need to cut hard wood of plastic, you will need to buy another blade, which costs $46.00, ouch! They offer a professional kit with three more limited use attachments for $60.00, ouch again. If you want to sand tight areas, you will need to buy the ""sanding finger"" which I have yet to find, since very few vendors sell Fein. Personally, I feel for the price of this tool they should have included more attachments, especially since they advertise this as a multi-function tool. Still if you are a tradesman that lays flooring under door molding for example, this tool will eventually pay for itself."
4,Make your own accessories,"I agree with the sentiments about the expense of Fein's acessories, but this is an amazingly versatile tool and a great sander. I've made my own grout removal blade using the blade from a cheap hand grout-removal tool, and my own ""finger"" sander using a short strip of hardwood wrapped with velcro. I also make my own triangular sanding sheets using scissors and larger velcro discs."
1,Disappointed,"I have owned the multimaster for a period just exceeding the warranty and was using it to undercut a door jamb to receive flooring. The tool blade pinched in the cut and broke the ""lever"" (part #410 in the head). I brought it to authorized repair center and was quoted $185.00 to repair it. The tool was in no way abused and used minimally for the time I owned it. The point I'm trying to make is that repair service for this product is not cheap and the tool should be considered disposable if something should happen to it out of warranty. It works great as a sander but is obviously under engineered for any serious consideration when applying it as a means to cut lumber. Buyer Beware!!!Disappointed, Chicago"
5,If you're desperate...,"This handy dandy tool doubles as a cast cutter... just in case your orthopedic surgeon goes golfing the day you're supposed to have your cast taken off. Reschedule in two weeks? I don't think so. Just attach a medical grade cast cutter blade and it'll be off in a matter of minutes! AND, because it oscillates instead of spinning, you wont't cut yourself (well, if you tried REALLY hard you probably could). Don't believe me? Test it on your arm and you'll see how safe it is. It tickles more than anything."
2,This is not the original Divine One On Roulette,"This advertisement should be taken off your listing. This is not the original Divine One on Roulette 1960. This is a composite CD put together with that particular title and much earlier than Sarah arrived at Roulette. ... The label Roulette IS NOT on the front or Back cover nor the CD itself. None of titles line up with the Roulette label either.Done by Sarah when she was a very young ameture.The advertising for this should changed and Roulette taken off of in entirely. The advertisement is deceptive & misleading.Have you ever seen Hellen Keller's house? WellI Wouldn't worry about it, Helen never did either & just the way I feel about this CD."
5,A great set of ideas for really good houses!,This is exactly the type of architecture that everyone should use in these days of 'excess'. Highly recommended as a source of ideas whether building or remodelling!
4,Full of inspiring ideas!,"I have been devouring the pages of ideas in this book. I think I have looked all through it a dozen times, because many of the concepts and ideas seem to improve and become more usable as I think them over. We live in a ca. 1970's ""split-ranch"" house and this book has me thinking creatively about using the space in our house in ways I haven't done before."
4,Show Me the Plan,"A Susan Susanka book is always a visual treat and a wealth of neat ideas, good details, and clever uses of space. As an architect, I would like to see floor plans of the houses to know how the spaces fit together and relate to each other. Individually, each space is a gem, but how do they tie into each other to create the greater whole?"
3,Taunton should hire better editors.,"This review is for the hardback edition. I have no problem with the content of this book; there are some excellent ideas, but I do have a problem with the editing. On page 120 the last sentence ends with "". . . every way (except in not having a floor), the window seat is treated as a"". There is no continuation of the sentence on pages 121-124; a new chapter begins on page 125. I hope I don't run into anymore editing errors. I expect better editing from The Taunton Press."
4,Less is most definitely more,"In this astonishing book, which is filled with wonderful ideas, as well as being a beautiful coffee table book, we are granted an inside look at a truly new concept in home design in our age of teardowns and mega-mansions, a concept that smaller can be more satisfying than larger, if properly done. Here we are presented with something seldom viewed these days, how to make a house a home. There is something for every taste herein, and it is even multi-cultural, with oriental viewpoints as well on both furniture and flow of the home. Spend some time with this excellent book to see how every size home can be made more personal and beautiful, no matter what the budget."
5,"Easy-to-follow instructions, tips, tricks and techniques for organizing space","Best-selling author of ""The Not So Big House"" Sarah Susanka teams up with architectural design writer Marc Vassallo to present Inside The Not So Big House, an interior decorating guide that explores both the tangible and intangible that add life, character, and aesthetic appeal to the inside of a home. From evoking the ""Classic Cottage Simplicity"" atmosphere to ""Texas Tuscan"", and more, chapters cover a wide assortment of moods as well as more general tips such as how to define space with light and how to evoke a serene atmosphere on a budget. Easy-to-follow instructions, tips, tricks and techniques for organizing space, and gorgeous full-color photographs on every page make this a vivid and expressive sourcebook of inexpensive ideas for both amateurs and professionals to make a home look great."
3,shut off,"I Owned the blue version of this CD player for about a year and loved it. I ended up giving it to a friend and it still works wonderfully. I bought this one as a replacement, it [is't good]. The original headphones hurt and the player was cheaply built. Mine is all scratched up on top and the lid is loose. That is of course expected eventually. The main problem I have with it is that it just randomly shuts off during playback. I tried to tape the open lid button because I thought that I was opening the lid in my pocket but that wasn't it. The lid does sometime open when you don't want it to. I still can&#65533;t figure out why it won't play but I am not happy with it. The skip protection doesn't work at all on mine either. The remote is pretty cool though. And the hold function is very nice when it&#65533;s in your pocket."
5,"This Album Kills, Gently","Not to get too personal or anything, but I recently gave this to my Mom for her birthday. We went out driving to go to a restaurant and by the end of the night we'd listened to the whole thing. We hadn't spoken to each other for over 5 years and now we talk a couple of times a week. I've been a fan since the mid-80's when Heyday came out, and sure enough my Mom's favorite song here is Tristesse, which is from that album. I think this record is phenomenal. If you are skeptical about them, get this one - they have absolutely nothing to hide behind here. It's all about the songs: the lyrics, spear-headed by Steve Kilbey, one of the most articulate and well-read songwriters of all time (go ahead, laugh at me - I don't care), and oh ya they also happen to be MONSTER guitarists, brought out all the more by their understated, gorgeous, shimmering acoustic work here."
4,brilliant rediscovery,"Astonishing. If like myself, you were a fan years ago, get this CD and catch up with what the Church have been up to! I knew they were good, but this good?? WOW! I suspect my taste in music has matured, and these musicians have clearly been evolving from an ""indie"" rock band into something far more creative, adventurous and unique.I won't give 5 stars because I want the next album(s) to be even better if that is at all possible!Definitely the finest ""Unplugged"" album I've ever heard, and an excellent example of how giving talented people unrestricted creative space can result in something really amazing.Now I've got 15 years and a dozen or so Church Albums to catch up with."
3,Please check the item carefully,"I just received the above unit from Etronics and the Audio player & SD card was not included, despite the fact that the Amazon page says that it's part of the sytem and the unit packaging said it was also.Etronics are claiming that on THEIR site it's not listed so I'm not entitled to one.This is very frustrating as I can't seem to find anybody to take responsibility.I will probably return the item, even though it seems like a very good unit as I simply cannot abide false advertising (regardless of whether Amazon or Etronics are at fault).Customer service at Amazon really sucks."
3,Good in a classroom setting,"This book would be great in a classroom setting but not so much for one on one at home. We had to skip or modify a few of the activities that required ""class room participation"" (such as counting the number of girls/boys in class) because I bought this book to practice with my son at home over the summer."
3,caveat emptor,"The editorial review included on this page is not for this album. Despite the same title, I don't think the personnel is the same and they are on different labels. The review is of the Blue Note release."
1,Watch Out,"Watch out...this software is only partially enabled. To get the full version you will have to spend [more money]. Further, the software is difficult to navigate. Don't be fooled by the cheap price...you get what you pay for.GB"
4,"Nice watch, feels and looks great on the wrist.","Feels nice on the wrist and looks great. Only thing that I didn't give it a 5 stars is that when I got it, it has been 3 seconds fast per day since I got it, but for an automatic watch that is not COSC certified, it is excellent! If only it is like +/- 1 second, then it would definitely be a 5 stars!"
1,"chef tim puts the ""rim"" in rim job cuisine","Seriously, this guys an idiot. Who are you trying to kid Chef Tim? You are a terrible chef. I would rather eat a steaming plate of Bulldog diarrhea. There's actually a drinking game that coincides perfectly with this video... Everytime he says oops or burps or vomits in his own mouth while he's burning porkchops- YOU TAKE A SHOT OF RUM, RUM, AND SOME MORE RUM!"
2,Not all are original recordings,"It's hard to complain because I bought this 3cd set for a penny, but even at that price I didn't get my money's worth. At least some of these are not the original hits. I played some of these back to back and it is very easy to tell the early recordings from these rehashes. Of the 4 I checked, only 1 was the original hit. CD comes in very cheap packaging with no insert. I wish I had my penny back."
5,Software Managers Should Get This,"Software managers should get this. You know, the people that have to put up with us weird software developers. I bought a copy, primarily to see what one of the better software authors/developers had to say. I was not disappointed. You may not agree with the end result, but it certainly is cheap -- good bang-for-the-buck considering this level of consultant charges ... per hour. Take a long and start out with an informed decision."
3,"stresses equivalence of the two languages, for most purposes","So-so. The treatment of the issue is fair and balanced, but one could really do without the author's comment and footnote that programmers who feel C-like syntax is ""morally superior"" to VB-like syntax are ""fools"" or ""full of c..."". This is really off-putting.Overall, useful and reasonably priced but no great revelations."
3,Limited Scope,"The book does a nice job of comparison of specific language features but does not deal with the issue of programmers from backgrounds other than C++, Java, or VB6. If you do not have people with those specific skills to consider in your selection, then the book has limited value."
5,Fabulous!!,"I discovered this lotion while visiting my mother and was so impressed with it that she let me take it home with me. I have a 3 year old and can never find enough ""alone time"" so get any lotion on me so being able to use this in the shower makes life so much easier! After 3 days of use my husband commented on how soft my skin was so it didn't take long to make a difference! Buy it as fast as you can!!"
3,"Excellent music, ok performance","This recording has some beautiful compositions by Vitezslav Novak, student of Antonin Dvorak. However, I'm afraid it is not great for the average listener. Bergische Symphoniker plays well together, but it lacks in dynamic contrast and I don't hear much of a spirited, ""Czech"" performance. A great recording of Serenade in F is the Ukranian Chamber Orchestra, which I believe is only available in mp3 at this time."
3,Not bad but ...,"Some plastic was already broken when I got it delivered. I'm pretty sure that it's not a delivery issue, but more likely a product issue."
2,Judge it on it's own merits,"And it still isn't as good as the MST3K version. Anyway, as someone else noted it's not the same cut that MST3K has. Abby isn't seen in flashback in the 2nd half, Buffalo Bill's song at the Pit Stop is cut out and there's a whole backstory to Sam's invisibility at the beginning. But there is more of ""the elusive Robert Denby"". My guess is MST3K was a cut for TV (where you have to clear time for commercials and clarify things quickly) and the commercial release may have been a cut for foreign markets to introduce the show or pass it off as an actual theatrical production."
1,Don't waste your money with this video,I saw this movie and it couldn't have been any worse. This movie is so bad that they showed it on MST3K
1,Do *not* buy this video,"I saw this movie on MST3K and laughed my ass off. It's composed of two lame plots held together by cheesy dialog and even worse costumes and sets. If you absolutely have to see this movie, then do yourself a favor and buy the MST3K version."
1,And Death doesn't pony up for gas money.,"I saw the MST3K version...which tells you the caliber of this ""movie."" This is actually two episodes of an unsuccessful '70s TV pilot--each one worse than the other--spliced together to look presentable ...it doesn't. The flashbacks, dubbing, voice overs, Jim Stafford's singing--not to mention the clothes and hairstyles--make you want to change channels. Hard to believe the lame plots--one for each episode of the pilot--were concocted with the help of Steven Bochco. This must have been aimed at NBC viewers when Fred Silverman was in charge. Maybe a little Tom Wopat driving by in the General Lee would have added some excitement--NOT. The only thing missing was a touch of Joe Don Baker for that authentic malaise flavor. Ride at your own risk."
1,Follow-up after repairs,"From my earlier review, you will recall that I had problems with the hook & loop sanding pad and the rotation mode of sanding. I received the unit back from the Columbus, Ohio regional service center (after more than twice the quoted repair time) and the rotation feature broke again within 30 seconds of my first use on some poplar trim. At this point I am quite dissatisfied with this product and Makita as well. This sander cost about twice what comparable products without the rotation plus random orbit mode cost, and it is essentially a very heavy, bulky and expensive 6"" random orbit sander. The regional service center promises to get it right this time, but to be truthful, it was defective from the start. I attempted to contact Makita (in California) but met with only automated phone systems and a long distance bill. It will be the last tool I ever purchase from Makita for my small cabinet shop."
1,Follow-up on repairs,"I have had this sander at Makita's regional service center (the second time) for over 4 weeks, and still no sander. They have told me that the parts needed to fix it are ""on national back order"" and were unable to provide any estimate of when I might have the sander back. I have already purchased a Porter Cable sander as its replacement. I have suggested to the Makita regional repair manager (in Chicago) that this kind of treatment was unacceptable, but with no results. I beleive that they should have replaced the sander with a new one after it failed the second time. It is unreasonable to expect me to pay for this sander, two trips to the service center, three long distance phone charges and a replacement sander so I can continue in business."
4,Great,"I bought this item about a month ago. I use it for steel studframing, lots of power, clutch settings are good. I have onecomplaint, when using a long magnetic extension the tip wobbles. But other than that it is a quality tool."
3,Dual Monitor Video Card,I wanted to experiment with dual monitor support under Windows XP. Matrox G450 was one of the cards that is compatible with XP. I could not get the second monitor to work as expected until I downloaded the latest XP drivers from Matrox website. It now works like it is supposed to.
3,A little dissapointed,"The imagery and precision of these speakers is amazing for nearfield listening. Unfortunately, the complete lack of bass seem to accentuate the highs and makes the overall experience harsh. I simply could not continue listening for more than 15 minutes. It is almost as if they are too accurate. It does seem that older, softer music sounds better than newer stuff on these. But sometimes you just want to crank ""Back in Black"". I am going to listen to some Mozart for a while to determine if I will keep these. IMO, the Bose Companion 5 are far superior at half the price or less. I just put those on my wife's computer when I got these. I want them back!"
5,Original manufacturer's battery worth the extra money,"When I bought my video camera over 5 years ago, I purchased one of the cheap replacement batteries as a back-up. It lasted less than 1 year. The one that came with the camera, on the other hand, lasted more than 5 years. Given this experience, in addition to the all the bad reviews I read about the off-brand batteries, I decided to put out the extra money and get something that will last. Only time will tell, as I have only used it a few times so far. But my initial experience has been promising - I used the camera for several hours straight and still had all of the bars on the battery meter."
4,Hmmm,"Bought this battery for my bro-in-law in Argentina. I assume it is doing fine. Interestingly, the Panasonic battery that came with my similar camcorder crapped out long ago, whereas the aftermarket spare battery I bought is still going strong...4 stars because it is probably a good battery, but not the best value (overpriced)."
1,Not Panasonic genuine product,"Battery that I receive not Panasonic genuine product, it's produce by 3rd party manufacturer.The battery look different from the picture showing on the item description page - there is no Panasonic logo on it's back. This battery work much worse than original one, it's just a low-quality fake..."
5,The Chalenge of Contact,Great story also easy to read!!! Philip H Kraph writes about his experience with such sincerity that I cannot see it as mere fiction.Lena
3,Not bad but not for me.,"This is basically a nice watch. It looks nice and keeps time well so why the 3 stars? The light is horrible! When you push the button to illuminate it you can barely tell it's lit and you definitely cannot see the time so what is the point. I did not want a watch without the light but ended up with it anyway. If you don't care about the light then this watch is fine. If you want the light, forget it."
1,Poor service sent wrong item unable to contact anyone bty e-mail or phone,Terrible Sent Wrong product. I tried numerous times to contact seller by phone and e-mail to get code to return with no sucess. Had to buy the product locally as I needed it for X-mas. Paid twice once for wrong item .
2,Uncomfortable cushion,"I just got this and yes it was really hard to follow the directions. Also, the cushion is so thin that the bar totally digs into your legs. The swing is too low to the ground and your feet drag. I don't like this swing but it was cheap!"
4,three seater swing,This swing is very nice. The only gripe I have is that the cushion is very thin. Other than that it is very sturdy.
3,not the great buy that I hoped for,The reviews mentioned that the directions to assemble were awful.They weren't exaggerating. These directions were a horror. After completely assembling this swing I was disappointed that the seat was shorter on the bottom then my old swing. It's cushion is also not a padded making it feel less comfortable. I'm settling.
1,Missing Screws!!!,"There were no screws with the swing to use to put it together. So at this time it is still sitting in the box out by the shed. It would be a great addition to our yard if we were able to actually use it. I am not sure if it was a packaging mistake or if the parts are just not included in the price, either way I will definetly being buying else where the next time I decide to buy a swing."
5,Everybody loves it,"I bought this because it was a bargain at the price, and was very pleasantly surprised by the how well it was made. A nice swing that can hold two to three people, easy to assemble (well mostly), and quite comfortable. We liked it so much that we bought two more."
2,Extremely Boring,"I really do not know what everyone is thinking. AMG loved it. The other people on here loved it. This is the most boring album I have ever heard. The first song is essentially someone holding down a key or two on the ""strings"" setting on a keyboard for 30 minutes with minimal change. The other tracks may add wind chimes or a dog being near a mic, but it is the same bunch of nothing as the first track. Call it subtle and brilliant all you want, but the only time I even bother to put this on is when I am going to sleep. I give it two stars because it is nice to fall asleep to, but really has no other applications. I honestly can't even listen to it."
4,I love these choc. candy,"I love sun drops but, a high price. They taste great! Love that they are all natural. I rated 4 stars of the price,"
3,All natural candy,"These are a good candy for children that need to be on all natural diets. If eaten plain, they are no match for M&Ms. They worked well in monster cookies, however. At least, I thought so. My husband and children did not agree with me, however. I think these are an excellent alternative if some of the artificial flavors and colors found in other candy do not agree with you (or you don't agree with them)."
5,Delish!,"I've eaten Asher's chocolates (sugar free variety) for years and this peanut butter truffle bar is delicious - tastes real and is very satisfying for a chocoholic like me. Great taste, great quality."
4,Classic Stuff!,"This is one which my dad had on LP, but which got lost in the shuffle, years after my dad passed on. I remembered it, and one day I decided to go looking... assuming I might find it on LP on Ebay. Instead, I found it in CD form, right here.The recording quality (considering the age, particularly) is wonderful, and the music which I've been remembering for years is now right here on my portable Archos media tablet, playing as I type this! Ahhh...."
4,Desmond,Overall a very satisfying set of pieces done in the fine Desmond manner. One or two pieces are done in a more upbeat style than Desmiond's usual style.
4,brilliant!,"This is as funny a CD as I've ever heard. Rusty Cundieff's songs are incredibly deft (not def, although they're that, too) in their mixing of parody, verbal dexterity and even some internal rhymes that put the average busta to shame. The movie, of course, is brilliant as well.A personal favorite, from ""Come Pet ..."": ""It's our job to educate, infiltrate or shred 'em/So c'mon, let's spread 'em ...""The only thing that keeps it from five stars is the idiotic ""White Cops On Dope,"" which isn't in the movie and shouldn't have been on the CD. And why isn't ""A Gangsta's Life Ain't Easy"" (the song that's playing while Ice Cold is maxin' and relaxin' in the hot tub wit' his ...) on here?"
5,Hilarious AND Brilliant,"What makes this CD so great is despite rap being one of my least favorite musical genres, these are really good tunes! They're lyrically hysterical AND they rock!It's a short list of films that can bear repetition. This one does. My copy has survived heavy usage for almost 10(!) years, but the soundtrack has the full versions of the songs.See it, buy it, love it!"
4,NWH Rocks The Soundtrack,"Unless you watched the extra featurs for the movie, you probably haven't hear the entire songs (and in some cases, NONE of the songs, as 'Ice Froggy Frog' and 'White Cops On Dope (parody of Body Count)' aren't even in the movie. I love listening to this cut as I am driving. Yeah, its kinda childish and stuff, but the songs they parody (My FAVORITE is the PM DAWN parody 'I'm Just A Human') are actually quite good. And, to be honest, the best song on the album, which is kindofa political statement about the Rodney King beating and race riots in LA, is 'Guerrillas In the Midst', and its not humorous at all, just really good and politically potent. If you like the movie, you will love the soundtrack."
5,GREATEST ALBUM EVER!,The soundtrack to the funniest movie lives up to its expectations. Avatar Records must reissue this masterpiece
2,Got a toe run in both feet first time,"I didnt get more than one, maybe 2 wears out of them. Felt nice just not reinforced well in the toes"
2,Specifically written for Catholics,"Ok book, but specifically written to Catholic students. While some principles could be applied broadly to Christianity, most are very specific to the Catholic faith."
4,Excellent publication for anyone first trying Azaleas,"If you have decided to try Azaleas in the garden, on the patio, or in the greenhouse, this book can show you how to start. If you live in a 'doubtful' area,such as Northern climes,it discusses where might be an appropriate place; it even discusses Azaleas in planters.so that you can move them when severe frost threatens. It is ecouraging to learn that many Azaleas can be transplanted easily - even when in full bloom!"
2,Huge Woofer,I bought this product after seeing a good review in Consumer Reports. I wanted small speakers and the advertised dimensions seemed to fit my needs. Unfortunately I did not check the size of the base woofer. It is the size of a small doghouse! I returned the speakers without ever listening to them.
2,Not what you'd expect from the publishers of fitness,"This book is an A to Z of fitness, in short form. It explains concepts and healthy living principles and is probably good for the uninitiated. It is NOT a program to follow or any sort of guidebook for healty living other than as a lookup reference. If you are looking for a program try SHAPE your life, from the editors of shape magazine."
5,A tremendously helpful book,"Can't say enough good things about this book. I am a fitness-book-junkie, so books that just cover the basics don't do too much for me. Although this book is written in language suitable for beginners, it covers some of the more advanced concepts dealing with strength and endurance training. I have put some of the principles I learned in this book into practice, and noticed a difference after just a few weeks.I think the people who will find this book most useful are those who regularly work out, but have never been able to afford a personal trainer. This book cost far less than one session with a trainer, and I learned plenty."
5,Great For the Beginner,"A 5 star book for someone new trying to stay/get in shape (not the bodybuilder) and maintain healthy outlook. Keep it out on the coffee table to keep youself on the ball, and don't give up."
3,Sketches the broad strokes but what about the fine print?,"This book is a well-rounded way to begin your quest for fitness. It represents the age-old methods of keeping your body fit while rightfully ignoring the fads. However, this book does not accurately represent the newest medical findings i.e. the last year and a half. I also found that some important ideas behind overall health were not addressed. As a side note, this book is also poorly organized and works better as a reference and not a cover-to-cover read.In general, this book is a good supplement to reading current information (such as Health Magazine) and other fitness books. In life you must always cross reference information and question its valididty."
5,Fitness Bible,"This book has EVERYTHING you need to know to be healthy, happy, and most importantly fit. It has great detail (which it not boring nor complicated) that is very thorough. This book is much better than the magazine. I workout off an on maybe 3 times a week and really need motivation to workout. After the first few pages of this book I wanted to work out everyday to my full potential. You don't need a personal trainer to look like a goddess. With the illustrations and chapters in this book. You will have all the tools and motivation to do it yourself. Whether in shape or someone just wanting to better their health it's a definite reference book you want to have in your home library."
5,Sturdy and very useful,"This storage rack is very useful and can hold lots of different stuff. I didn't realize how large these storage racks are and they are extraordinarily sturdy. I put a ladder, ironing board and step stool on them and there is still plenty of room for more stuff. One thing to keep in mind before purchasing this add on is they do hang pretty low so if you are installing the actual storage racks in a space that doesn't have too much room below it (i.e. above a garage door) then you might not be able to use this item. Would definitely recommend this item and clears a lot of space for the large bulky items."
5,Hyloft storage rack ladder hanger,Very easy to hang a ladder and my metal horses. Able to keep these items up off the floor. Very happy with the purchase.
2,Made in China,"Mine arrived scuffed, it did not seem like there was enough coating on them.These are marked as made in China. Now my proudly USA built HyLoft storage rack has these made in China hangers."
3,The Sundered Worlds sucks,"These stories aren't my favorites by Moorcock, and ""The Sundered Worlds"" and ""To Rescue Tanelorn"" are pretty mediocre. ""The Eternal Champion"" is okay if you give it a chance, and ""Phoenix In Obsidian"" is a good continuation of that story, my favorite in this volume.I know that ""The Sundered Worlds"" is a key work to understanding Moorcock's multiverse, but it reeks of 1950's Asimov(zzzzzzz). It was put between ""Champion"" and ""Obsidian"" in this volume for some reason, but I only saw it as an annoying distraction. The whole thing is worth reading if you're a big Moorcock fan, but it's not something I could ever re-read."
5,Good except for SUndered Worlds,"Eternal Champion is undoubtly, the most original fantasy series I have ever read next to LotR. Moorcock did a great job with the first-person perspective. I didn't like sundered worlds because I am not a sci-fi buff."
1,"Yes, it is really this bad","I am a great fan of Hungarian cinema but this is one of the worst movies I have watched in a long time. The characters gives ""speeches"" rather than converse with each other; one never feels sympathy for any of the characters; the plot twists and turns without ever seeming real or engaging;the props and settings are amateur. The script is awful and with such bad material it is little wonder none of the actors really shine. Károly Eperjes is a great actor and his work in live theater is light years away from this film, which I assume he undertook to pay the bills. István Szabó's ""Sunshine"", which this film echoes, is a much, much better watch than this."
3,Great artwork; thin and predictable story,"Another reviewer commented that this book was not reviewed by any of the major review journals, but it was -- School Library Journal reviewed it in 10/2000, and Publisher's Weekly and Booklist both reviewed it in 9/2000.The book itself is nice to look at. The illustrations are cute and have that ""warm fuzzy"" feeling that's appropriate for a Christmas story. The story, however, is pretty disappointing. It is predictable and pretty saccharine in its sentiment. The artwork really makes this book, but unfortunately it's not enough to make it a great book. Cute, but not a first purchase."
5,Freisans and Druids,"I have loved this movie for years and was happy to get a NEW copy since the one I had was a really old tape. Can't understand why this was so overlooked. Charleton does his usual hero stuff but the druid stuff is good too. And, of course, the war machinery was a good touch. Why don't we make more of this time in our history? BYW, Rutger Hauer has a similar one out called: Flesh and Blood, though a little more sexy."
5,"Hey, it's Charlton Heston","Usually old movies are really cheesy and fake, but not this one. Hey, it's Charlton Heston! Along with Excalibur (directed by John Boorman) this is one of my favorite ""Middle Ages"" movie. The War Lord has one of the best, if not the most realistic battle scenes ever filmed-- the castle scene, it's uttlery fantastic. I'll take the realistic and non-glorified battle scenes of this movie over those of the Gladiator anyday. Also, Heston's love interest in this movie has that classic hollywood look, I can't describe it, but it's there. This movie is kind of the opposite of Braveheart, they're both dealing with Lords stealing other men's women, but in this movie they actually end up falling in love. Not too shabby."
1,Gone But Not Forgotten,"I would love to give a review,but it is somewhat difficult since this DVD has still not arrived.According to an email I received it shipped from Brazil(no less) on January 15th.I have been watching the news to see if a ship sunk there recently or that maybe the Somali pirates had expanded their range of activities.The only other logical explation is that it was absorbed by a black hole."
2,The War Lord with Charleton Heston,I tried to view the DVD yesterday (12/12) and the movie would not play. I checked the DVD and it is cracked and has a large scratch and several others. This is the first time I have had a problem with the items I have ordered.
3,warlord,"Wasn't everything I remembered it to be, but nothing ever is. Some good action sequences but nothing spectacular."
5,Wonderful!,"Just back from a vacation in Eastern Europe and suffering from a lack of these lovely dishes in the USA, this book gives me a way to recreate some of those meals and more! I felt lucky to find this book."
5,The road to God directed by a Realised Master.,"This book changed the way I look at life, and my way of thinking. This book is a must for all people on the Spiritual path. Thank you for this book Yogananda!"
4,Good book for those looking for some direction,"This book is very strong in stressing the point that you can plan, think, talk all you want, but nothing happens until you take positive, consistent action! Becoming an Actionaire is a great concept - and the book really drives home that point. This is a great book for those who may feel that they are ""stuck"", and are looking for some direction. He does not pull any punches - and this is not a ""feel good about yourself"" book - this is a get of your butt and make something happen book."
4,Down to earth advice for writers,This short book (less than 100 pages) gives basic principles for those who would publish. But these principles pertain to other forms of communication as well. The author draws from her positive experience with writing groups.
3,Not bad at all,"This compilation of smooth, airy and light fusion-fare does work, and provides a listener with a nice world-music infused collection of mood music to lounge, dine or relax to. The Bedouin Cafe collection definitely falls somewhere between Budhha Bar, and Cafe Del Mar, but the Middle Eastern and North African flavor of this collection makes it a great addition to anyone's lounge music collection."
1,THE SAD TRUTH ABOUT THIS BOOK!,"In my opinion this book has very little to do with heavy metal guitar.The author places heavy emphasis on the blues,and blues influence in modern rock music.The fourth chapter titled""The influence of early rock and blues"" which is 33 pages long tells the reader all about people such as Robert Johnson,Otis Rush,Buddy Guy,B.B. King,and mike Bloomfield.The author goes on to tell the reader in chapter six entitled""Early heavy metal lead guitar"" about such people as Jimmy Page,Jimi hendrix,and Eric Clapton.There are some exercises and other lessons that are covered such as basic power chords,""whammy"" bar exercises,basic rock/blues scales,and some other stuff.There is NO mention of bands like Black Sabbath,Motorhead,Metallica,Slayer,or any of the other great metal bands that(for me) come to mind when I think of heavy metal guitar.This is a great book if you want to learn about how the blues influenced rock,and learn a little blues guitar while your at it."
1,Garbage,"This a poor attempt at writing. The history is accurate but the writing is under developed. Unexciting, uncreative, and unskilled. Two thumbs down Rinderle."
5,sanding made easy,"I have not owned it long, but it has saved me a lot of effort in the short amount of time I have owned it. It was easy to assemble and for narrow boards up to 18"" there was no problem with it. When I did a wider board 26"" in width, there was some wandering in the feedbelt, but it was easily corrected. The sanding drum was parallel with the input feed table when I received it so that needed no adjustment. By connecting my shopvac to the sander, there was virtually no dust floating in the room after using it for about an hour."
3,Useable but disappointing,"I bought this sander soon after it was released. There is a problem with the feed mechanism. It slips, so that the work piece gets a dip in it where the drum spins over the stalled piece. You can prevent the stall by pushing on the work piece on the infeed end and then pulling on it at the outfeed end. But this is really a drag (no pun intended), and then you need to make at least three very light last passes to make certain none of the slow downs (which occur even when pushing or pulling) have marred your surface. As an amateur woodworker, I can live with this. The machine has made it possible for me to get a very nice surface on some highly figured cherry panels in my kitchen cabinets. But at the same time, I had expected higher quality from Delta. And since buying this machine, I've noticed that the comparable Performax machine has come down to a competitive price. Check it out before buying this one."
4,Does as it says,"Works great, I just wish the cord was easier to wrangle about.Wish this unit came with some disposable pans."
4,Good buy,Does what it says and does it well. Don't touch the sides when you open it. I would recommend to a friend
5,so cool,so cool to to have a hot lunch no more sandwiches. I can have a hot breakfast done when i get to work
5,Best lunch leftovers,"My husband runs heavy equipment and hot lunches were non existent. Then a co-worker told him about the RoadPro. Cold sandwiches and greasy leftovers are now a thing of the past! He looks forward to lunchtime and eats better now that he gets hot food. Thirty to 45 minutes before lunchtime, he plugs it into the cigarette lighter in the dozer and voila`! it's hot and ready to eat. Recommend that you use the tin foil pans that fit inside to help keep it clean. =)"
4,RoadPro,Seems to be very good.- it would be nice if there was a thermostat to control the heat level
5,Very pleased,I have only used this portable stove on my road trip but it has exceeded my expectations. Well worth the money ! 5 stars !
5,Car Oven is Hot,"This is the closest thing to a microwave in my car. It is affordable and a good thing to have, especially if your meals are on the go but made from home. It works like a charm....Just use foil and you never have to clean it."
4,great product,"This portable stove does exactly what it says it does. I'm a long distance truck driver, and being able to prepare hot meals in the truck saves me a lot of money! This little stove does the job."
5,Big Hit,"Brought this on our ski/road trip from Tx to Co, and loaded it with homemade breakfast burritos on the 2 day drive up. It saved us ar least two stops and our grown kis thought it was a great idea. Don't use it often but will use it again for another road trip."
1,on the road,"We travel a lot in our car, and thought this would be a good thing to have since our time is limited at each stop. We have a Toyato Rav, and plugged it into an adapter that was plugged into our cigarette lighter. First time I used it I could feel it getting warm, then the adapter blew out. I looked at our owners manual, and it said that it is set up for 100 watts, and the roadpro is designed for 144 watts. So I can't use it."
1,Recieved 2 DOA,"I ordered 2 of these stoves. 1 did not work, Was sent a replacement. It didnt work either."
3,gets 2 hot,use no more than 20 min. cord & plug plus outlet get way 2 hot / good 4 warming stuff that's about it !
5,roadpro stove,"i am a lineman for a electric co. construction crew . we work out in all kinds of weather,so when it is cold out a hot lunch is great. i purchased this with a bit of caution thinking it would not be that great. boy was i wrong! this unit is well made and works far better than expected.it went over so well that other guys on the crew purchased one of there own (5total). the only complaint we have is it needs to be alittle larger and to have a thermostat. not really a complaint more of a suggestion .i highly recommend this to anyone."
5,"I loved it,",now I don't eat my food cold. the only thing is that it takes like 20 min tho heat up which I don't mind.Great value I have seen other similar items much more expensive!
3,Power of 144W exceeds vehicle capability of 125W,"I would have liked to see the actual power consumption listed. The statement ""Doesn't consume much power but will heat a good-sized portion in approx. one hour."" is not an accurate description of its power consumption. I know that appliances that generate heat require significant power, but I was hoping it would not exceed the 125W maximum rating for my car. The sticker on the bottom states 144W. I had to send it back. I am giving it a three stars because I don't know how it would have functioned if I could have tested it. The quality was good except the power cable is too thin for the power consumed. I have found that 12V heating appliance cords are too thin for the power required to generate the heat. Manufacturers should at least double the diameter of the wire used for these appliances. How much can that cost to improve quality and safety?"
5,awesome!!,hubby is a truck driver home daily and was sick of cold sandwhiches for lunch everyday...what a great way to eat homecooked meals!!! this thing gets HOT!! it is not a warmer it is an oven lol! I take the leftovers and wrap loosely in foil and hubby sets it is and says in about 15 minutes he has a delicious hot meal...welll worth the price!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Reel Problems,"I have two of these units the and the 3/8. The 3/8 works fine. This unit has given me problems from the start. The issue is that the hose has difficulty rolling back into the unit. The guide is no help. This is especially true when the unit is cool, but is an issue even when warm. The result is that it is very difficult to get the hose to roll completely into the reel. I expected more from a unit that cost this much."
1,BEWARE,"I bought this card and it was DOACompUSA store WILL NOT REPLACE IT. I have to pay shipping back and a refund minus the original shipping ""might"" be refunded!No more CompUSA for me"
1,Avoid this product like the plague!,"This product is defective. Yes, it is tempting to buy a cheaper product, because you think ""hey, 6 USB 2.0 ports for only $10. It's worth a shot!""It's not worth it. IT worked for me for a few months, and now is garbage, doesn't recognize USB 2.0 peripherals.Time to get a non ""value"" brand.-propynyl"
1,Horrible!!!,"Does not like USB 2.0 peripherals. Usually just does not even recognize that anything is plugged in. I've updated drivers, gotten a replacement directly from startech, and they even had me flash my BIOS! Nothing has worked. Time to turn this into a frisbee and buy a decent USB card. Oh well."
1,Garbage,Got one of these as a gift. Does not recognize USB2.0 devices. Do not... repeat... DO NOT buy one of these. I so wish I had read the reviews before I got one.
5,This book ROCKS !,"I am not normally a fan of Mystery novels, but met Lori at a book convention and decided to give the book a try. This book was AWESOME the heroine is a strong, tough and nutty chick. Just the way I like them. I could not put the book down and am glad I bought the next 3 books in this series."
5,Excellent start to a new series,"I didn't know what to expect when I picked up all three of Lori Armstrong's books in the Julie Collins series. I don't read a lot of mystery, and I now realize that I've been missing out. How can I not root for such a passionate, flawed heroine? Wonderful writing, excellent characterization and a rich plot make this series a keeper."
1,Ugh,"Despite what others have written, the heroine is utterly ""dislikable"" with horrid/questionable character traits...truly despicable, and not very bright to boot."
3,Blood Ties,"While I thought this was a fairly well written book with plenty of descriptors, when I thought of Julie, I thought of a giant cigarette. Smoking was such an addiction, and to me it colored some of her redeeming characteristics, making her seem weak that she couldn't/wouldn't arise above living in the much appalling nicotine world. She had no discretion about where and when to light up--just did it wherever, whenever her extreme addiction directed her. Her character was rude with regard to the incessant smoking; I do hope that, in future books, she at least makes the effort to quit; I will not read another of her books if I find more of the same. I can't take anymore smoke!Whimseyl"
4,"If you enjoy Handel, don't miss this great work.","Handel's Saul is one of his lesser known works, but certainly one of his best. Written in 1738, the story of Saul's descent into madness was preceeded by Handel's own health problems. Fortunately, Handel recovered and wrote one of his greatest oratorios.The voices and orchestra in this production are top notch. The heart rending pathos in the last act as David sings, ""O Jonathan! how nobly didst thou die"" will bring tears to your eyes."
2,Sillas Baxton,"ESTAS illas Las Compre sin parrafo traerlas mi pais Honduras, y CUANDO Las Fijas arme no me Salieron ajustables me parece Que Tienen Problema. Por Tanto seria bueno Que El Vendedor nos DE UNA Explicacion del PORQUE no Funciona la palanca de subir y bajar."
2,K Clamp Bessey vs Gross Stabil,"I own several K Clamps from Bessey and I am not very happy with it. The major thing is the plastic. In case the Clamps fall, it will break immediatly. I had this experience a few times. You can not even get any spare parts.The Gross Stabil Clamps which I own last longer and not one broke. But even if it would, you can buy the parts seperate.Everything else is fine with both Clamps. There is no difference in the daily use.The good thing on the Gross Clamps is that they are a few $ cheaper, but not huge amounts."
1,POOR FUNCTIONING,Too flimsy for serious wood working. Clamping jaw does not easily move along connecting shaft. Any glue on the connecting shaft/column stops the whole clamp from working. How can you use a clamp to glue wood together and not expect to get some glue on the clamp parts??? Spend the money for the better Bessey clamps. They never should have put this model on the market. It only makes the rest of their products look questionable. I gave four of these away.
3,"Bessey UK3.018 18"" Uniklamp","I won't know the full story until my Grandson-in-law opens the package on Christmas day, but my husband, who has worked with tools all his life, had a heck of a time figuring out how it was supposed to work. The terse explanation on your web page says what it is supposed to do, but a more thorough description is definitely in order!Thanks for getting it to me in a timely manner anyhow!"
4,Use it regularly,"I use this book quite regularly in my Emergency Medicine practice. I work in a small ER that often has no orthopedic coverage and do all my own reductions and splinting anyway. The book is concise, with good drawings/pictures. It definitely guides fracture management for those patients I am not 100% sure what to do."
4,A surprising good book,"Young Gervase Howard is a sheltered girl when she enters the Wingate household and meets Davis Wingate. After Davis marries the selfish Roberta, Gervase leaves the Wingate household and goes to work for Florence Nightingale and Gervase follows her to the Crimean where Gervase meets Davis again. But following an accident Gervase is once back to Wingate Hall to take care of Davis.I enjoyed this book, I really liked the parts about Florence Nightingale, This was really good book that should not be missed."
5,Captivating!,"My first Morris book and I am captivated by his style, and well developed characters. Everything was great, from plot to great dialogue. However, it would be nice, Mr Morris, since we waited so long for the happy ending, that there were a little more to it : ) Can't wait to read his other books!"
2,God's Handmaiden,"I got this book because some of the story centered on experiences with Florence Nightengale. Since I am a former nurse, I thought that would be interesting. The book is readable and has a fairly good story. But for me it was a bit sappy - reminded me of a Hallmark movie."
5,This book changed my life!!!,"At first glance I wasn't sure of what to expect from this book. I read it out of curiosity and once I started the book, I couldn't put it down! If you don't take the subject matter to seriously and just read the book for enjoyment, you will learn from the tips Lisa Johnson shares. She seems very knowledgeable in this subject matter and I am thankful that she took the time to pass these valuable tips along to the public. I have dated a few millionaires's myself and after reading this book, I was able to be myself and at the same time keep them interested. I keep a copy of the book with me at all times, as a reference. I feel that every woman should read this book and I hope the author will write more books revealing any other tips that she may have!"
5,"Helpful, well-written, and hysterically funny","I love this book! Without taking herself or the subject matter too seriously, Lisa Johnson gives extremely helpful tips not just for snaring rich guys, but for making yourself look and feel like a million as well. Regardless of whether or not I marry a millionaire, I'm a better person for having read the book. The guys I've asked about it say these ideas could work on anyone. What a find!"
3,"Nothing you didn't already know, I have better suggestions!!","You already know everything written in this book! It's ok, not totally horrible, and it's not boring, but you shouldn't waste your money on this!Girls, girls, if you're bombshell material buy""The Bombshell Manual of Style"" by Laren Stover, Ruben Toledo; if you're a good old fashioned girl with morals and standards, if you're married buy ""Fascinating Womanhood"" by Helen B. Andelin if you're single buy ""The Fascinating Girl"" by Helen Andelin it's absolutely beautiful!! Well just don't buy this, it's really not worth your money!"
2,A Few Questions for The Author,"The reviews say that Lisa A. Johnson's book offers good suggestions on how to be a good companion and not a gold digger: I am glad about it. Yet, she is advising on how to date not just anybody, but specifically THE RICH. Does she mean that the rest of us is not entitled to the same self-confidence and emotional support in a companion? Are we honest, sensitive, understanding, compassionate common men (teachers, small businness owners, musicians, employees, local journalists etc.) condemned to be our self-despising girfriends' cheapo-free therapists?"
5,EXCELLENT!!!,"This book has influenced me to soar to greater heights than I had ever imagined. I have become more aquainted with others and my life is more comfortable because of this book. It is not based merily on looks, but on personality, technique, and strategies. Thankyou Lisa Johnson!"
1,"If you are looking for the rich boy, this is not the place","When I bought the book, I thought it was a satire or parody (like ""The Code"" to ""The Rules"") and was expecting some good laugh. Boy was I wrong (about the content). Apparently the author is not being frivolous and the subject is taken quite seriously. Imagine, for only $5.99 you can learn to marry into the top 5%! Not only the whole idea that someone who is still single can write a book about ""snatching"" a millionaire is suspicious, but the enomorous amount of contradictions in the book embarrassed me, an avid reader, for reading such incoherent and inconsistent piece of writing.See for yourself if you are so inclined. Maybe you will pick up some good tips I intentionally overlooked. All the good advice only costs you 6 bucks and hurry up before other readers take up all the goods!"
1,Don't buy this book,"I have bought Ginie Polo Sayles books on how to marry the rich and they were ten times better than this one. This author gives advice like: don't wear pantyhose with tennis shoes, and proper table manners that everyone should automatically know."
5,Fein By Me!,"The Fein Turbo II (9-55-13) has received a heavy workout in my shop for years. It has handled all kinds of dust and debris, including sheetrock dust that chokes many other vacuums. The long hose provides great access and reduces the need to keep moving the vacuum. The power tool switch lets you hook the vacuum to a sander, router, or other dust-producing tool. Start the tool and it starts the vacuum.Another great feature is the low decibel rating. Many carpenters know that the shop vacuum is the noisiest tool in the shop. Fein protects your hearing and saves you money with its great durability. This tool is bulletproof!"
1,Avoid - faulty,"I cannot tell you the disappointment when we were half way through Jamaica Inn and the film suddenly skipped to the end. Useless. What do you do - buy another copy? This was only the second movie we watched in the collection. It quite puts you off even trying with the others. We got a refund, but what a waste of time. No need these days for faulty goods to be sold like this."
4,Mystery of Sector Five,We're grandparents who have come to look forward to seeing new episodes of this show. It's not mind numbing like some of the animated shows our grandkids watch. The plot is actually good and the music is too!
5,True HEPA filter,"This is a true HEPA replacement filter for your heat pump (about 99.7% elfficient). It removes a substantial amount of air borne particles and is great for allergy sufferers or just to cut down on household dust. I need to replace the filter every three months as the dust accumulation is significant and air flow would be reduced if left unchanged.I prefer this type of filtering system (mechanical) to electrostatic air cleaners that may be slightly more effecient (99.9%) but stop working altogether in about a year. At least that has been my experience with two different models, one of which was a Honeywell."
4,Easy to order,When you know exactly what you want it's easy to find it here. The shipping time was a little long but the process was easy.
4,Great Family Movies,"Though none of these movies would ever win an acadamy award for best picture (maybe that's a good thing-), each movie can be viewed and enjoyed by grownups and children. They are clean, sometimes hilarious (Littl-e Heroes), and always teach good morals. The bad guys lose and the good guys win. Simplistic? Maybe a bit, but yet they give you glimpses of how significant life can be without all our gadgets and busyness. And the movies value the lives of their characters so that you start believing that it is important to prefer others above yourself."
1,Amateurish writiing at its best.,"Case in point: (Pg. 236) ""'Good day to you', James said overly formally to the woman, and stopped her in her tracks, he thought. He walked purposefully from the room...."" Weak verb and adverb combinations (ie., ""said overly formally"" and ""walked purposefully"" ) dominate the author's writing style. Besides the horrible writing, the story is a real dud."
3,Stiff hose keeps this product from being great,"Buy this product for the reel, not the hose. The hose is so stiff that it is nearly impossible to use with air tools, and winding it up with the reel is an exhausting chore. I plan to buy some good reinforced rubber hose and splice it into the hose right after the bend restrictor. The reel itself is fairly sturdy, I wouldn't call it ""heavy duty"" though. Even with its drawbacks it is still a good value at $34.99."
1,anti-Semitic diatribe - good propaganda!,"As has lonnng been said, when Israel is held to standards that no other nation is - or that no reasoned comparisons are made with - then you are reading anti-semitic diatribe. As one reviewer correctly described this one specimen, ""sheds light on the inhumane practices of the Israeli army and government."" What about the PA's inhumanity?What about Arafat's first murder - that of the then highest ranking black US diplomat? A Belgian man was also torturously murdered by El Presidente at the same time. When Arafat was through, one could not tell which one was black and which one was not.Gotta love them ""Facts and Fables."" Arab fantasy ideology lives!"
3,Stel-la is stup-id.,"This is one of those books which are very visual, each scene sreaming ""I'd be a really good movie--just watch this one!!"" The thing is that the movie could be a visual stunner scenery-wise, but the one-dimension characters are yesterday's toast without the Marmite. Stel-la is stup-id, and Martin must be a very lonely little prince indeed to be charmed by her."
1,Rubbish,"Gosh I was disappointed by this book. The characters were two-dimensional and unconvincing, there was the suggestion of an interesting subplot involving disgruntled locals with a grudge, of which we heard nothing more, ditto the hinted at marital infidelities and the background to Stella's flit from london to the countryside. The first-person narration was plodding and dull - Stella's observations were pedestrian and her problems (sunburn, hunger, an insalubrious suitor) uninteresting. I've seen lots of glowing reviews of this book on amazon and honestly can't see why. Avoid at all costs, life is too short for dross like this"
4,Not an easy read . . . but worth the effort,"A difficult style of prose that only an English major could appreciate and love, ""A Country Life"" is still enjoyable, hysterical and insightful in a neurotic sort of way. This is not a quick read, but laboring over the text makes the reader appreciate Cusk's style, or, conversely, frustrated to no end. If you love writing that truly showcases the English language in all its finery, then you will enjoy this book."
4,"Smart, surprisingly funny","I bought this book in an airport because stories of small town or country life are one of my guilty pleasures. It didn't fit the bill at all. Instead, it was a remarkably clever and often hilarious read. Yes, Cusk's style takes getting used to. (It also reminded me of the very peculiar Novel on Yellow Paper.) And I'll admit to having doubts for the first 100 pages. But the payoff is tremendous and left me laughing out loud on the plane. An unusual, engaging read."
2,"Prozac, anyone?","Stella is a thoroughly dull and neurotic woman. The other characters are equally bizarre and unappealing. There is no discernable plot. There are a few well written passages, some funny, but not enough to warrant slogging through this dreary tome!"
2,"Pretentious, over-written style ruins it","Clearly this is a matter of taste, but I find Ms Cusk's prose almost unreadable. She seems to think that using an endless catalog of long words and exploring every nuance of the action (relevant or not) is what makes LITERATURE. She never stops trying to show off, like a third rate academic on an ego trip. This, for me anyway, is not what good novels are about. They're about being evocative, vivid, visceral maybe. Ms Cusk wouldn't know viscera if she found it on her doorstep. I can't comment on the plot, if such there be, because after 100 pages of this I was almost climbing the walls. (I'm giving a second star for punctuation!)"
4,Not light and breezy,"This novel is wicked, funny and profound. At times, it is almost boring--in the way a hot summer day is boring; in the way anxiety can create boredom--in other words, the boredom the reader feels is a metonym of what the protagonist experiences. The narrator's voice is deceptively ""English"" and uptight, in the manner of John Dowell, narrator of Ford Maddox Ford's _The Good Soldier_; but Stella deceives herself, not in thinking herself more perceptive and moral than she actually is, but in her self-belittlement--behind the self-deprecation we can see a wonderful person, a funny companion, a desirable friend. The final page delivers a surprise that had me thinking for days and days. A book to relish."
3,"funny, yes, but short story gone long","Yes, I did actually throw the book across the room in riotous laughter at what is perhaps the funniest line of dialogue I've read in years. But then I was left with the rest of the book. And there just didn't seem enough plot to hang the thing together. So what that Stella is this and Stella is that? By the time the revelations happened, I didn't care about them. In fact, by the time they happened, I wished they hadn't, thinking it would have been much more delightful had she been a nobody doing nothing, instead of a somebody doing nothing. The last few pages were simply a drift into morals and wrappings and endings--all of which didn't fit the murky waters of the book. In the end, I wanted more quirky weirdness like the grotesque in the post office--and less clear understanding about ""who Stella really is."""
2,This is an imitation of Stella Gibbons's Cold Comfort Farm,"If you like reading books about city types who go to the country, a much better, funnier book is Stella Gibbons's Cold Comfort Farm. Ms. Cusk must have been thinking of writing a 90's Cold Comfort Farm. Even her heroine's name is Stella.While reading The Country Life I kept remembering the dialogue of Cold Comfort Farm, and I certainly missed it in this poor imitation."
4,I miss Stella already,"This is a wonderful luxury of a book. Rachel Cusk is a rare talent. I liked ""Saving Agnes"" enough to read ""The Temporary"" the following year, and this second book was worth all the praise her first one got. ""The Temporary"" is a masterpiece! But where ""The Country Life"" is a comic masterpiece, ""The Temporary"" is dark, so be warned. It seems to me after reading both a drama and a comedy by this author that there is nothing she can't do. I have even read her non-fiction book on dealing with a pregnancy and a newborn. Now that is reader loyalty!! She is worth it."
5,Truly Gifted Writer,"I adored this novel. It wasn't just the likeable character of Stella or the complex Martin, it was the whole package: the prose, the humor, the plot, and I could go on. This is a novel in which there is unbelieveable love and gratitude, and I found it almost the perfect book. The only way it could have been better if I'd read it while on vacation. It is definitely and escapist novel!"
3,The Enigma of a Country Life,"The Country Life, by Rachel Cusk, is an enigma. After reading the book and discussing it with friends in my book club, I still am left with the question -- What was the point? Generally when I read a novel I am led to identify some theme or philosophy, to find the author's message. In this one, I kept asking, ""Who the heck are these people?"" If Stella left her life in London because she felt it was too ""certain"" in pursuit of a life filled with uncertainty, then she was successful. Was the author telling her readers that life is full of questions and uncertainties? She left this reader in a quandary."
1,"Wierd, wierd, wierd","...Did I miss something in the novel? I am not an English major, but certainly not uneducated either, and found The Country Life a most difficult and disturbing read. This is English humor? Gees...I used to love Benny Hill, but this book didn't have me even cracking a smile. Just as Stella seems to have difficulty separating fantasy and reality, I kept asking myself if I was really reading a novel this bad, or was just imagining that I was.Maybe I'm just not sophisticated enough to appreciate truly great fiction. Naw, I believe I can recognize good writing when I see it, and this wasn't it."
2,Less than Impressed,"I received my ""Limited Edition"" sanding center which includes a long extension shaft, 4"" pneumatic drum. I hope this is truly a ""limited edition"". It was delivered undamaged, but the problem is, the 12"" disk is so warped that the machine cannot make a single revolution. Wouldn't budge. You would think...call me crazy; that a slight amount of quality control would notice this before leaving the factory. A call to the closest service center, about 20 miles, said they could take care of it. All I have to do is bring it to them. Now I have to hump over 200 lbs of iron back up the cellar stairs, load it into the truck, deliver it to them for a few days and viola' a machine that I can use. At this point I'm left wondering if the included ""long extension shaft"" has a dual purpose. I gave it two stars because it looks impressive."
5,Absolutely Brilliant!,"This guy is a GOD to say the least! I first found some of Hook's music on Kazaa and bought the CD, let me tell you there isn't a song that I don't like! I'd suggest this to anyone who's anyone."
2,The Hose is too stiff,The vinyl hose becomes unmanageable in cooler weather. I am in Austin Texas which doesn't get that cold. At temps below about 50 I cannot even get the hose to retract because it doesn't want to bend. At cooler temps the hose develops a lot of memory to where it is difficult to use. I have about given up on using it until April or so.
1,Waste of money,"This product is a WASTE of your money. why you may ask? I propose you this. Before you purchase this product try this. All you need is an old bowl, and a can of beer. fill the bowl half way up with beer, and set it in your yard. leave it out overnight. Just try it. Its how i catch my slugs for when i go fishing. The little buggers are alchies i promise."
1,Try another toaster,"I bought the 4 slice version of this toaster, and quickly discovered it to be a waste of money. Not because it broke or anything of that nature. It sucks because of the details, and when you decide to spend this much on a toaster, it seems to reason, you're interested in the details.I have two primary issues with this machine:1) Its not possible to turn off just one side. I generally prefer not to toast both sides of a sliced bagel or English muffin.2) The 1"" slots. This might initially seem like a good idea; it is one of the features that initially drew me in. But a crucial flaw lies with the implementation of these wide slots. There is not a self-adjusting, centering carrier for the bread; not a carrier of any kind. It's just a big void. So if you insert a normal slice of bread it has to lean to one side or the other resulting in, of course, uneven toasting; absolutely unforgiveable in a toaster of this expense."
1,Underwhelmed,"I found that this toaster got rave reviews by different sources (cooking.com, etc) but I must admit that it is not much better than the $30 toaster that I purchased 15 years ago. On the highest setting, the bread is very lightly toasted. The warming tray seems to work adequately, but I would never spend this much money on a toaster again."
1,Terrible product,"Toast was uneven, controls poorly designed, and the unit broke in the first week. KitchenAid returned our money. We bought the Breville toaster. Wonderful product. Second disappointment with a KitchenAid product. Will look for Breville products first from now on."
5,Confused with the pricing of this product,"I would really like to purchase this toaster for my son's wedding because I purchased one last year and I love it. Why did I pay $48.40 and this exact same one (because I have the paper work from mine) is $149.95? That's totally robbing someone!!!! I would like someone to respond on this, please."
5,Angel Messages,"Perfect! Absolutely perfect! The book and cards fit very well into my own healing work. Comfortable, low key, simple, with messages from the Masters. Anyone, regardless of personal belief system will benefit from these thought-provoking words of hope, comfort and joy. Well written and easy to work with."
4,not the same old drivel,"The first reformation battled over the doctrine of justification (by faith). If there is to be a second reformation, it will probably be over the issue Edwards deals with in this book...sanctification. Now that I am a Christian, how do I go about my life? We tend to fall into the same old patterns of striving to ""keep doing our list"" as he points out, instead of living the same way we began in Christ, by grace through faith (See Galatians 3, and Eph. 2:8-10). Book is practical and helpful...refreshing."
4,"Life changing, excellent analogies, highly recommended.","This is a life changing book. The critical difference for Christians is in how we perceive God. Is He our co-pilot, or is He THE pilot? The book clearly states Mr. Edwards correct position - correct theologically and exigetically! However, I do have one complaint - thereby giving this book a rating of 4. On page 184 he says, ""This love communicates loudly and clearly, 'You do not have to change in order to maintain my love for you.'"" This statement is fundamentally true. We are commanded to love our neighbor as ourself. However, our prayer and desire is that each person we know DOES change into the new creation God wills them to, through the cleansing blood of Jesus Christ! And not just a basic, one time change. But - as Mr. Edwards has so vividly portrayed in this book - become a person who ""disappears"" into humility and meekness, as our Lord Jesus demonstrated in His life on earth."
2,A Calvinist w/some stimulating thoughts,"The author appears to be yet another who teaches Calvinism (aka ""false doctrine""), although he does stimulate thought. However, I am finding the book has so many seemingly internal condradictions that it is difficult to read. Many of his thoughts are biblical. Many are not biblical. I do plan to finish it.Reader beward..."
2,beer brewers--don't bother,"Very short beer section, not worth it.Author copied old world recipes from other books and tossed in very few comments.More translation of ancient measurements would have helped."
4,Not smooth,"Don't get me wrong - i use these clamps a lot. If I could do it over again I would get the K body or the Jet 12"" clamps instead. All of the UniKlamps I own don't slide along the bar well need one hand to push on the locking mechanism to get them to move. I love the weight but I often find myself reaching for the Kbody 24"" when these would do."
4,Environmentalism through story,"In this book Barry Lopez uses a novel approach to many of his stories: the short story written in the form if nature essays. Other nature writers--Edward Abbey, for example--have been known to take liberties with the exact details of the stories they tell, but Lopez actually creates new worlds in this collection of short fiction pieces. At his best, in stories such as ""Teal Creek"" and ""Sonora,"" Lopez lets the story itself convey whatever larger purposes he might have. In his less successful pieces (""Conversation""), he beats the reader over the head with political psychobabble, almost to the point of sounding like propaganda. However, his ability to tell a story is undeniable, and it would be hard to argue with his place-based approach to environmentalism. And Lopez himself would be the first to say that it is the story itself, and not the moral of the story, that mattters."
2,About like Truman's others so far,"The dialogue in this book was somewhat better than that in Murder in the Supreme Court, but the characters were flat, the exposition was blaring, and the collusion required for the plot to work was pretty unbelievable, even for fiction."
2,DISAPPOINTED!,"This is the first book I have read by Truman and guess it will be my last. I was very disappointed in it. I had heard such rave reviews. The book was very confusing to me. To many people involved and to much detail about places, to many murders and all by same people, in to many countries. I stayed lost a big part of the time. That may be due to my lack of smarts, but I was still lost. Sorry. Mrs. Truman."
3,So bad it's good?,"I really enjoy B movies. My friends and I have a whole series of absolutely awful movies that are so bad they wrap right around to being brilliant. Murder in the Smithsonian falls into this category.Having spent a few years in the D.C. area, I greatly enjoyed reading about spots I had seen and visited, and enjoyed the quaint dialog and characters. But some of the concepts and scenes are so downright terrible that I applaud the author. My favorite example, from the Detective Captain Hanrehan enticing the damsel in distress to have dinner at his house:""In all modesty, Miss McBean, there isn't a better cook in Washington than yours truly, and when the going gets tough, as it is now, I cook. I guess it relaxes me, makes me think I'm something I'm not and puts decent food in my cop's delicate stomach. Look, I'm not some lecherous old guy chasing pretty Scottish lassies. I'm a cop who likes to cook. What do you say?""Who wouldn't agree to that? Or to this book? Absolutely hilarious!"
4,Well written but some parts unrealistic,"I loved the parts describing California life, but the parts about the club becoming so famous seemed unrealistic. Kristy was a baby about being jealous of them. Also how can Dawn book her own flight back to Connecticut? That was totally irresponsible. I liked Dawn a lot better in the earlier BSC books. Later on she goes from friendly and kind to snotty. She was a coward to try to run away from her problems."
2,SOOO Unrealistic,Oh please how can some one just sneak away and fly home like that? You can't just go on the plane like that!
2,"KPCN, not WPCN","The television station that reported on Dawn's club would have call letters starting with K, not W, because all radio and television stations west of the Mississippi do. Also, one thing that always kind of annoyed me about this series is that the younger girls were NEVER allowed to turn twelve (many sixth graders do) and the older girls were never allowed to turn fourteen! (ditto on eighth graders)"
5,A great book with some unusual systems,"This is more of a scientific book than most craps books and delves into three systems rather heavily - The Flagship, The Advanced Flagship and the Point and Figure System. He talks about other stuff too, like deviation from equipartition, the zero bet, and his unique money management system. He also goes into how to lower the table bet limit, how to select your bet, how to track your play and a lot more. The write up said this originally sold for $99 so its certainly worth whatever you can get it for here - you'll learn a lot of little known methods and systems!"
1,Utter Rubbish!,"Firsty, the slim booklet is very poorly published. It looks like an amateur/self-published effort. Several pages became detached while I was reading it normally, thus preventing me returning it to Amazon.There are several mathematical and arithmetic errors, and the writer is very poor at this craft. He constantly refers to himself as ""the author"". ""The author did this; the author did that"" presumably not knowing the word ""I"".None of the above would matter in the slightest if the contents had any value. 'The author' spends the entire book trying to predict the unpredictable. The word ""Random"" means ""unpredictable."" Therefore to attempt to predict random events is absurd.There is one real nugget of wisdom in the book. This appears on the very first page, and says:- ""Using systems in this book...in the long run....for casino games, will errode your bankroll. Do not gamble with money you cannot afford to lose.""For this quite true piece of advice I award the booklet 1 star."
3,Warning for perfectionists,"I have an eating disorder, and I love to read about those who have recovered. Unfortunately, as a perfectionist, this book was very hard to read. There were a LOT of homophone mistakes (vial for vile, waste for waist) which really detracted from the meaning. There were also terrible apostrophe issues (son's for sons, etc.). Maybe this won't bother everyone, but I really wondered if this book was edited with spell check instead of an editor.As to content, the book was okay. I didn't find it particularly compelling, but it was not a bad story. It was nice to read that this woman is on her way to recovery. However, it felt like the author might have been a bit premature. I would like to know how she moved on after her stay in treatment.I threw the book down in disgust with the editing errors a few times, but I still finished it."
1,EXTREMELY dusty brake pads,"Though advertised as low dust pads, these Hawk pads are anything but. I've been driving for 35 years and these are by far the dustiest brake pads I've ever experienced.Current car is a 2005 Hyundai Santa Fe with 123,000 miles. My front wheels are a mess and have to be washed constantly to keep them clean. More than 90% of my driving miles are on highways, dust should be low. But dust is so bad, I'm taking pads off after less than 10,000 miles and replacing them.Performance is good but not worth the excessive dust on the wheels."
2,Barely coconut flavored,"I really wish that the ingredients had been posted. Here they are for the rest of you: Water, Organic Alcohol, Organic Agave Syrup, Organic Coconut Milk. This very, very faintly smells of coconut, and kind of, almost, tastes like it. Not sure why an extract, particularly one as sweet as coconut, needs a sugar in it? As heat typically decreases the intensity of flavor(s), I can't imagine this ""Extract"" imparting much coconut flavor into baked goods. I will try it in ice cream and frosting and update this review at that time. I am thinking that, in order to get a super-duper coconutty flavor, I am going to have to just take the time and reduce some pure coconut milk. Or, maybe I'll try juicing a fresh coconut. Has anyone else tried this before? Results? I am open to suggestions."
1,A Complete Boondoggle,"I am preparing a list of scholarships for non-traditional students and bought this book to help in my research. I am very disappointed in it thus far. Most of the links to websites that I've tried do not work, many the descriptions of scholarships leave out essential information, and several phone numbers are out of service. A very poor job indeed."
1,sales promo,If I remember correctly it was just a sales promo to get you to buy other stuff. It was of NO value to me. I promptly returned the product.
3,"A good workbook, but a little too condensed","Okay, there are some nice bios and pictures of the featured keyboardists, with their personal tips quoted in the side bars. But that is fan magazine stuff. The guts of the book are the seventy or so transcribed and recorded licks. Unfortunately there is no information as to the song source. I could recognize some by ear, but the licks are presented in the ""style"" of the artist, so there is no guarantee of accuracy. Also the licks are generally four bars long and played only once on the CD. On the plus side each lick is referenced to a page in the book via an introductory voice over. I think the best use for this book is ear training: Hear the lick, play the lick, write down the notes and then check your results against the book transcription."
3,Curly Joe TV clips,"This DVD is simply a compilation of Stooges' live tv clips from various guest appearances of a variety of late night shows. There were multiple Stooges appearances on the Steve Allen Show and others similar in format.Although there were some clips of maybe one or two film shorts of the original 3 Stooges, most of the DVD highlighted the final three, Curly Joe, Larry, and Moe. Most of these were recreations of some of their past skits.I bought this DVD because I enjoy the Three Stooges and because it was at a very good price.If you like the Stooges, then I say buy the DVD, but just don't expect too many laughs or new skit bits. If you are just a curious Stooger, then perhaps pass on this DVD. Either way it's bargin entertainment and beats the garbage programming offerred on today's networks.You can purchase this dvd on Amazon at a steal of a price."
1,Junk Production,"Minus 5 stars. Want to watch a bunch of un-restored clips which are then hacked, ruined, and stomped on by a bunch of production stooges with crappy graphics and cheap video effects? Then this is for you."
4,LOST COMEDY TREASURES,"For any stooge fans this DVD is a must. A wonderful and delightcollections of the stooges, off and on screen."
2,Freud Router Fence: Beautiful Construction/Difficult to Use,"I bought the fence to install on the extension table to my table saw, so had no pre-drilled mounting holes. The entire device is beautifully made, with a focus on precision of settings. However, there were NO installation instructions or telephone numbers for support. As I worked through, it became obvious my router plate was too big to accomodate the fence. For the cost of the plate and the fence, I can buy an entire new router table, fence and accessories! Regretably, I finally packed it up and returned it to Amazon."
4,Professional tool at incredible value,Fact is I paid this same price at a show! I recieved my fence a week later via mail and without instructions. I bought the both sets of adapters available and just installed a set of Incra T-tracks instead of the inserts it came with. I'd rather have the track for sliding and for additional clamp/featherboard options. The installation was simple and self-explanitory. You can't beat the value of this fence at Amazon's price! I paid shipping darnit!
2,One major problem....,"This fence is built like a tank. So why the 2 stars? The fence I received would not sit flat on the table. It was about 0.016"" high on one side. The aluminum fence face supports were properly ground perpendicular to the high side of the casting. It was thus unusable as delivered since variations in tightening down the casting onto the router table would cause variations in the alignment of the fence faces to the table. Because the casting is made of aluminum, the screws stripped out when I tried to shim it. So it went back. Maybe I just got a bad one. But the bottom of the fence should have been ground flat as well. That would have eliminated the possibility of the problem."
1,Great idea poorly executed,"Bought the SH-5 to outfit my newly made custom router table. Within minutes of opening the box I knew I made a mistake. The fence itself is a well designed and crafted product, however, this doesn't do much good if it can't be installed. There were no installation instructions, nor contact information for customer service. Then, after working with the unit for awhile, it became evident that I needed the ALEPSH-5 extension plate to make it work with my insert. Good luck finding one. I was unable to find any information on Freud's website, and when I called them, they directed me to a dealer in Florida. They didn't have one, didn't know when they could get one. I gave up and am in the process of returning the unit to Amazon."
4,Good not great,"This is a good fence that provides a lot of very fine adjust ability Fairly easy to install, easy to adjust. Had to shim one side to keep fence flat. Was a little disappointed in the mdf/melamine sides. Replaced them with oak and it works great. The big advantage of this fence is the very fine adjustments that can be made."
5,Very Nice Router table Fence,This fence is as good or better than any others I have seen. The dust collection port works well and the fence is easy to calibrate.
1,junk,what good is a fence if you can not mount a hold down or featherboard to it ? dont think your gonna make cabinet doors on this thing unless you are gonna hold the wood down by hand fences without a track or ability to mount a featherboard are worthless find something else or shall i call you stubby
4,Nice piece of equipment,"This fence seems to be a very good value. Upon receipt, I began installation and soon discovered that I needed the optional extension base plate. I contacted the folks at Freud and they were very helpful and said that the Tool Crib folks could special order it for me. I then contacted Tool Crib and they, astonishingly, refused to special order it for me. So, they had essentially sold me a product that I couldn't use. I then contacted a local tool supplier, who was a Freud ""dealer"" and he obtained the part for me with no problem. The bottom line is that I would recommend the product, but my advice is that you do not buy it from Tool Crib, since they will not do what is necessary to help you get it into service. Instead, go to a local supplier of Freud equipment and get the product along with the support you may need."
3,"Great fence system, but not 5 star...","I purchased this fence about 6 months ago and mounted it on a home made router table. It has worked like a champ, but with all things good you can find some things not so good.Good: Solid construction, easily to adjust for exact cuts, dust collections works great with Shop Vac, delivers quality cuts.Not so good: The fence is not level with the bottom of the base. I had to put a piece of 1/4"" MDF under each of the mounting screws so the fence bottom sits flush on my table top. Worse, the fence cannot be closed completely (both sides touching in middle behind the bit) which makes making fine cuts difficult since the wood loses contact with the fence.Overall: Great fence system with an ok fence. Without question I would buy again. Easy to use and very, very well made."
5,Freud SH-5 Professional Micro-Adjustable Router Table Fence,"I received my Freud router fence this week and installed it on my router table.(old cast iron table saw top, that I had milled out to accept the rosseau router insert) I had to use the included extensions to fasten the fence to the cast iron top.It was a simple matter to drill and tap 2 holes in the top, and presto the fence bolted right on. The only thing left to do is buy an adapter 2 1/2"" to 4"" for my dust collector. I tried the fence out and it works great and was very easy to assemble. Everything seems to be quality workmanship and materials. I will probably buy a couple more of these for my other router tables."
4,good quality for the price,Bought this router fence table to go with my custom built router table. It is sturdy and well built. Have used it only a few times so far but proves to be a good investment.
2,Only good for a couple camp trips,"I bought 4 of these and they worked great the first couple times around. I had to throw away 3 of them as they leaked propane even with the canister on tight and valve off. They wouldn't ignite after a while, and just kept on leaking. It is a fire hazard to keep them around. I am going to be writing to Coleman to let them know of the problems as this can cause some serious injury. I don't know if the valve inside goes bad or what, but they sure didn't last long. Glad I only paid $15 dollars each for them. Good luck to fellow users and watch out for those leaky valves!"
4,larger is better,"Wanted a quality, dependable retractable garden hose reel with the maximum hose diameter available. The Legacy hose reel has filled the bill. The biggest drawback is the hose length is limited to 50 ft. Checked Legacy's customer service department, which is excellent, and they provided honest answers to my inquiries about this hose reel. Legacy does not recommend replacing the garden hose with anything but their OEM garden hose of same length and diameter since the system (hose and hose reel) was designed to work together. Purchased two more garden hose reels for the rest of my house hose bibbs. Read and follow the instruction manual provided with the product and the product will perform as expected/designed."
3,Legacy garden hose reel,"The first one I received was broken inside and wouldn't latch. The replacement reel was not aligned correctly with the level wind, causing the hose to criss cross and get hung up inside the reel and not able ot rewind all the way because of the overlapping. I disassembled the reel and aligned it properly and it works OK now. The level wind and the ratchet assembly seen kind of fragile. Time will tell."
3,Mixed Emotions,"I have the same reel for an airhose that works great. I dont know if its the bigger line or what, but it doesn't reel in evenly and gets jammed towards the end. Also the hose end leaked right out of the box."
5,Fantastic product whose maker has real customer service,"I searched extensively, tried out several products, and chose this as the best of all. It works beautifully and looks great mounted on your home. It is built to last adn well worth the price."
2,Not so Good.,"I've owned this product for over a year and it has failed 3 times. The first was an internal leak that occured immediately after hooking it up. This could only be fixed by the Legacy sending me a new one. The second time, the hose burst in the center. They sent a replacement hose. The third time, the hose burst again. I have never had any other hose burst in my house, so I don't think its my water pressure. I will say that the customer service is very good and they have sent out replacement parts. On top of the problems, the mechanism just doesn't work very good. I've had to adjust the tension so it won't rewind leaving about 5-10 ft left with no where for it to go. Even after adjust it, it works better if you leave the hose end open so the water is not in the hose. Of course this then leaves water everywhere as it wind up. I sometime thing it would be easier just wraping a hose around a hanger and be done with it."
2,"If You Have a Good Program, You Don't Need This","It's a nice book, but if you have a good Word Study program you don't need it. I especially wouldn't recommend it if you are using Words Their Way. I bought this book thinking it would be a handy thing to have the students make their own letter books. The cover designs of each mini book is nice I suppose, but I wouldn't recommend buying this book if you are already using Words Their Way or another good phonics program. You'll find it's a nice book but ultimately just a waste of money that can go towards something else."
5,The True Story of Marvel,"Stan Lee is one of the best-known names in comic books. He's credited with creating some of the most beloved superheroes of our time including The Hulk, The Fantastic Four and Spider-man. What most people don't really know is the real story behind the creation of these characters. Anyone who's read Michael Chabon's The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay will notice a great deal of similarities between Stan Lee's origins, which the authors meticulously recreate, and the fictionalized settings Chabon created for his book. Raphael and Spurgeon have written a fair and honest tribute to the work of Lee and in doing so, tell the story of the comics medium as a whole. Stan Lee: The Rise and Fall of the American Comic is about as smart and entertaining as biographies come."
5,"balanced, fair, and entertaining to boot","This fast-paced, engaging look at an intriguing man is well worth reading. The authors obviously did their research and interviewed lots of Stan's associates and coworkers (the bibliography is quite extensive), resulting in a thorough examination of his career and personality. This is by no means a ""slam""; in fact, there is a great deal of praise and respect shown for Stan's achievements, balanced with intelligent, well-founded criticism for his shortcomings.Anyone who's curious about the man vs. the myth will enjoy this thoughtful, engaging exploration."
4,Great overview of Lee and Marvel,"This book gives an excellent overview of Stan Lee and his contribution to Marvel and the history of comics. It came across as a balanced view, praising Lee's strengths as well as showing his weaknesses (and we all have them.)As I read, though, I wanted more detailed information on the 1960s glory years of Marvel; instead, this decade had the same amount of information as the rest and sometimes not as specific. I would've liked some interviews with others as to what they thought of Lee's working relationship with Kirby and Ditko, for example. Overall, though, highly recommended!"
2,Boorish,"I suppose there are 2 ways to write a biography... You can focus on a person's good points while acknowledging their shortcomings (which we all have), or you can do the exact opposite and concentrate on the subject's fault's while only giving a casual nod to their contributions.This book is an example of the later. The authors latch on to a set of peeves they have with Stan Lee, and never let go. Anything positive they have to say about the man is quickly qualified with reminders of previous criticisms.There is no question that Stan Lee made many important contributions to the comic book industry. He deserves a better biography than this.If you read biographies for their inspirational value, skip this one."
4,Fish seem to love it.,"I have native fish in my aquarium, and I like a cheap product. The fish seem to like this so as long as they are happy, so am I."
2,"Wrox (your f***ed if your) Beginning PHP5, Apache, and MySql Web Development (with this book)","This book right from the very beginning contradticts itself, it is full of different code for different things and typos.I created several pages just as they said in the book and all worked, but had nasty looking error codes all over them.If you are a beginner, which with a title like this books i presume so, don't even think about getting this. Its difficult to follow at the best of times.However all the code does work, just not well."
2,A good book for windows users,"I bought this book a couple of days ago after reading the cover (Bad Jon, never judge a book by its cover) and learning that it teaches you in both Windows and Linux. This is not the case. I am still in chapter one trying to configure Mysql under Linux. There is very basic linux setup configuration and then the book just assumes Windows is what you will use. I am retiring this book and picking up another."
3,"Accurate and easy to understand, but ineffective","I almost gave it two stars, but that wouldn't quite be fair. The book is written in a comfortable, informal tone and is easy to understand. It is well edited. The trouble is that it, like many programming books, doesn't TEACH YOU THE LANGUAGE. To use metaphor, it teaches you how to say, ""Where's the bathroom"" in PHP, but not what ""Where's,"" ""the"" and ""bathroom"" mean and how to use them in other sentences. It uses the tools of PHP to make a jig for you to perform one very specific task, but it doesn't give you the tools.Put directly, this book gives you complete code for a specific task and then loosely explains what the code does IN THAT CONTEXT. I want a book that teaches me the specifics of the function and syntax of various commands, allows me to use them to solve problems on my own, and THEN talks about broader programming techniques."
5,Excellent Book,"In the first few pages of this book, the new user of PHP, Apache, MySQL for web development gets a fast track into getting a server up and running fast, took me about 30 minutes. The remainder of the book is an excellent reference, with step by step howtos. This book brings the difficulty of getting a webserver running down to a level that brings success."
2,Not exactly what I was looking for,"I liked the premise so much that I ignored the warnings of others harmed before me.Yes this is yet another left-hemisphere didactic that simply does not work in a learning paradigm.Combine the dreary approach with with the more- than- plentiful coding errors, several per page, and you have it! The reason I took the time here, which I otherwise would not have considered.Six chapters and out, capitalism lives, at the cost of three days of my life."
2,Incorrect code and bad programming,"I'm not very happy with this book. The code examples contain errors - even the latest versions of the some of the pages that you can download from their website won't run because of things like missing curly braces or similar type-o's. I would understand a couple of errors here or there, but surely they could make sure that the code they put in the book and online actually runs?Also, the programming advice and style they give isn't very good, and occasionally contradicts each other from one chapter to another. I have experience with other programming languages, so I know that some of the ways that they recommend you do things are both more complicated and less efficient than other ways.All that said, I am learning what I wanted to learn - I just think there must be better books than this out there!"
4,Very out-of-date now,"This is a decent book, but the MySQL syntax is very out-of-date. If you're working with a current version of MySQL, this isn't going to do you any favors. Until they see fit to update this volume, I recommend buying something else.I've had great luck with ""PHP, MySQL and Apache"" by Julie C. Meloni (Sams Teach Yourself) third edition (2007). Its example projects are different and not quite as applicable to what I'm needing to do, but who knows - they may be just what you need. The biggest benefit is that it uses the mysqli commands that PHP 5.xx demands."
4,Pirate Cards,These cards are great and great fun. Nothing like cards that actualy look as tho you are on a ship with pirates!
2,Not so impressed,"I knew this item was not shipping from eBay, but the shipping charges were not disclosed on the initial order form. Note that the $7.79 shipping and handling fee will nearly double the price of this item whether you have enough to qualify for free super saver shipping from Amazon or not. Also, the carrying bag is too small to get the top closed with the cards in it. I would say that is rather poor planning. :(Those two points aside, they are attractively printed cards that come in a heavy cardboard box with hinged lid that can be used as a nifty storage box (a ""chest"", if you will)."
1,Smoke and mirrors,"I ordered this video as well asThe Complete Earl Scruggs StoryI didnt know it was legal to simply redesign the cover,Rename it, but keep 100% of the same content and call it a newProduct!!!! What a disappointment!!It's vaguely interesting to watch Earl Scruggs roam the country playing withOther music stars of the day, but not to buy two of them with different packaging!!!"
3,Sucrose Overdose,"Zelinsky gives this classic tale an incredibly romantic treatment, which will make you wonder if he forgot his target audience. Understandably, we adults love it, which is why it won the Caldecott and why you'll buy it. Still, its engine is an age-inappropriate message that romantic love conquers all."
3,Rapunzel (Picture Puffin Books),The illustrations are gorgeous but the story is too violent and mean spirited for young children.
1,Not the Rapunzel You Remember,"My children and I just turned off Scholastic's video retelling of this book by Paul Zelinsky. (beware of spoilers ahead) Rapunzel was always a simple story to me. After watching the video, I looked up the tale of Rapunzel and discovered that this retelling by Zelinsky aligns with the story the Grimms told. If your child loved Tangled, I wouldn't read them this story--particularly if they are very young. In this retelling, the prince finds Rapunzel in a tower. One day when the witch comes to see her, she asks her loosen her dress because it was too tight. The witch responds that she's a wicked girl and casts her out into the wilderness--where she gives birth to twins! This retelling was not at all what I expected and wouldn't recommend. I love fairy tales, but we're going to pass on this one."
2,Kind of boring...,I found this book to be rather dry and dull. The illustrations felt stilted and forced and the language used was slow and stately. I am not adverse to utilizing the original Grimm story but this book is rather like having a tooth pulled. You just wonder when it's going to end. The Grimm Brothers can be cheeky and garish in their story-telling but not in this re-telling and the pictures just blend into the background. Please don't subject your child to this story when there are so many fine old tales from which to choose!
3,Age-inappropriate text with beautiful illustrations,"A beautifully illustrated book with unfortunately a very inappropriate interpretation of a fabulous fairy tale. Rapunzel becomes impregnated by her prince while she is still imprisoned in her tower. The witch recognizes this because her clothes become to tight and Rapunzel is cast out. She gives birth and raises the twins by herself until her prince finds her. It seems so unnecessary for this sweet love story to be about sex. This book is recommended for young children. A fairy tale does not need to be about sex, teen pregnancy and children. I am sorry I purchased this book for my four year old, she loves the book (most likely the illustrations) but I am afraid of all the curious questions I am sure to receive."
3,purchase?,"The pictures are beautiful. I love the story. There is a pregnancy told in the story. The way it is written it does leave a lot between the lines (could invite a lot of questions for young child). I checked it out of the library because it is a caldecott medal winner, but I can not decide if I should purchase the book."
2,Repunzel book order,"I ordered a used Repunzel childrens book at a really good priceof less than a dollar, but was VERY disappointed that it was a library book. Don't know if it was a book thrown out of the library, butnow kind of left with the guilt...so if anything ask if the propertyis not a stolen item."
4,Repunzel,I love the book Repunzel by Paul Zelinsky. It is classic story that's been told time after time. The pictures in the book are so beautifully done that its worth just looking at for the art work in the pictures.I would recommend this book to everyone.
3,For the 5 Year old,My husband and I bought this for his baby sister (age 5) because she was enchanted with the movie Rapunzel. We bought her Twisted and decided that she also needed to read the book.
4,Modern Day Twist,"Zelinsky retelling of Rapunzel was different but still held on to being enchanting. The oil painting art work in this book is exquisite. This version of Rapunzel has an older read feel to it. I think the more classical versions would be for the very young children, yet instill a happily ever after read."
5,I Love this book!,"Buy this book! I love this book. The illustrations are great, probably my favorite Zelinsky illustrations. Particularly the picture of Rapunzel as a young girl and the one where the witch is taking her away. Beautiful. My daughter also loves this book, and we both read it together enthusiastically. I think it is good that kids know that these stories, such as Rapunzel are part of a tradition and subject to many revisions and reinterpretations. This book with it's classic illustrations accomplish this end nicely- and it is fun!"
3,Be ready to explain the birds and bees!,"This book is beautifully illustrated and well written, but the text may be too mature for many young children. I bought this for my four-year-old daughter. Reading it to her the first time, I was left a bit bemused when, on one page, Rapunzel is visited in the tower at night by the prince and then, on the next page, she's pregnant:""'Rapunzel said, ""If you please, Stepmother, help me with my dress, it doesn't want to fit me anymore.'Instantly the sorceress understood what Rapunzel did not. 'Oh, you wicked child!' she shrieked. I thought I had kept you safe, away from the whole world...'""I thought other parents might appreciate the warning, since you can't preview all the pages when buying a book online."
5,A superbly detailed version of a traditional tale.,"An excellent choice for many ages. This book is a beautiful and rich rendition of a traditional tale. Zelinsky has filled the pages with orderly, exquisitie details that are reminescent of Renaissance paintinings. The illustrations merit review closely and the reader will find new wonders each time they visit the work. Children of all ages will find enjoyment in these pages. Readers may particularly enjoy the intricate tower Rapunzel is locked in. The text has just enough suspense and evil and good strike a comfortable balance for chlidren."
4,"Good telling, nice illustrations","The illustrations in this really are very very lovely, but am I the only one that notices that Rapunzel never looks quite like the same person from page to page? I found that slightly off putting, but maybe I'm nitpicking. Despite this, the illustrations really are quite life-like and captivating. I found the drawings of the sorceress and the backgrounds to be particularly compelling.I think the telling of the story is very nice and while the story does deal with some adult issues (implied sex, pregnancy, violence, etc.) I think it's fine to read to young ones. I say better to expose them to these sorts of things in a controlled environment where you can discuss them together."
5,Wonderful Old Movies,"I have two copies of this book, one by the TV and one by my bedside. This is a great reference book for old movies, with wonderful, insightful reviews. It is also a great book to just read and enjoy. Ghani's love of movies is palpable, and it's contagious. I also like the feel of the book itself, very European. Highly recommend for anyone who loves movies."
3,helpful,"Would have picked 2.5 stars if available. Skeeter population seems to have been impacted (as evidenced by dead guys in trap). Overall, disappointed after 1 month.I'm starting to review other products to use in addition as the problem may require a multi-level approach.Flowtron BK-80D 80-Watt Electronic Insect Killer, 1-1/2-Acre Coverage"
5,lucero is the 2nd best band in the USA,"Ben has an amazing talent for lyrical explination.. These guys are creating new sound while managing to hold onto their roots in the SOUTH....Just behind Old 97s, Lucero is bound for glory!"
5,Best Band that is still togeter,"This band rules............Awesome, but they never come to South Carolina........but still think they are hands down the best band (that is still going at it strong) alive!!!!"
1,Big Mistake,"I'll describe for you the story.....I was walking into this best buy the other day and I heard this song ""sixteen"". It wasn't bad. Hell it was the best song I'd ever heard playing in a best buy. Bought the CD on a whim. Over time, they say most artists pro-gress. In this case, unfortunately, it means their albums start sucking.Except for the one song, every other one is disjointed and accompanied by the worst eddie vedder interpretation I have ever heard in my life. I don't know what these guys are pursuing with this country-alt stuff. But change direction. They sound like they could have a lot of potential, just dump the lead singer and get someone with an actual voice. This guy sounds like he poured hot lead on his vocal chords before recording."
5,Honest Advice for Any Buyer,Anyone thinking of buying a house should read this book. It is thousands of dollars worth of advice from an experienced broker for only $13! Randy Johnson gives you all the essential tools and knowledge to make an educated decision about your home and your investment. I'm an MBA grad and a finance professional and found this book offered much info that I had never learned about. Invaluable for anyone - finance professionals or otherwise.
2,not very useful,"Very disappointing. Contrary to the title, I did not find any useful information on how to save money on a mortgage. The author spends very little time on junk fees which can add hundreds or even thousands of $$$ in unnecessary fees to unwary buyers.The book also makes little use of the internet resources that are now available to compare rates.I would also expect a general opinion as to certain large lenders.There is little useful information here. Save your money and buy a copy of your credit report instead."
3,Dog Died Before I Could Use It,"I gave this three stars because it says, ""It's OK"" for the three star rating. I cannot give it a fair review because my dog died before I had a chance to use it. I purchased it because it came highly recommended for dogs with the exact problem mine had. Unfortunately, my dog died from Anaplasmosis, a tick borne disease, before I could give him this product."
4,Great review book for anyone.,"A great review book for anyone who will be taking the New York State Regents in Chemistry. This book has tons of review questions from the regents with explanations and answers. It might not be as detailed as a big fat text book, but overall, a great tool for quick reviews."
5,one of the top books recommended by teachers,i think that is a very informative book and it's useful both at home and in school. It also does a wonderful job in preparing you for the New York State Regents. Clear explanations and questions. A wonderful study guide and practice. I highly recommend it.
4,Well constructed,Well constructed and easy to install. The articulating arms work smothly and hold the TV at the set position. Capable of adapting to many makes of TV's.
4,sturdy,Purchased this to mount a 13 in. flat screen tv in a class c motorhome. I was concerned with mounts i had seen at different big box stores being flimsy for the application i was going to use it for. The tv gets bounced around a bit in the motorhome and i needed to be able to turn the tv in multiple directions for viewing. Purchased it and am VERY PLEASED with the sturdy construction as well as the many directions you can view the tv. It is sharp looking and will fit almost any tv.
5,Great for the price,This mount was very easy to install and does just what I expected. Can't beat the price and fast delivery.
5,"Solid, serious tool!",This oscillating saw is built with the highest quality materials to provide a dependable tool that should last a very long time. It is indespensible for making flush cuts and doing cutouts in wood and other workable materials. The big problem is the blades that are quite costly (about $20. each- from the manufacturer) are not of the same quality materials and dull quite quickly even just working in materials such as pine or plywood. Hopefully at some point in the near future other tool makers will be granted the rights to produce the blades which will not only bring down the price but should improve the quality and maybe some new blade designs.
4,"Works well, but...","This blade is very useful, but be mindful of uses. This is not for aggressive rough in work, the blade will not hold up. Awesome for finish trim work and the like (watch out for nails). It is expensive, but has saved me 10x its cost in time and trouble just be careful, don't let the laborer's touch it. Plus it gives a very clean result. When you need to flush cut casing moldings for lami flooring saves hours."
3,"1 3/8"" Precision E Cut Blade",Nice blade for precision work. A bit pricey. Does not last too long in general or rough work.
3,great blades,I like the blades but not the price. I do not understand why these little pieces of metal can cost so much? I really think twice before I use them.
4,Fein Blades,"Very expensive, but they do a fantastic job. I'd be lost without this tool and its attachments, now that I have come to rely on it so much.jackew"
5,"contractor, naples fl",this is probably the most useful hand power tool in the universe.but i must agree with those who say the replacement blades are ridiculously high in price. but it is still one of the got to have tools. GOT TO HAVE IT!!!
5,Fien saw blades for wood,These blades are great even cheaper than on ebay . You have to buy a three pack but well worth it.
4,Fein Precision Blades Good but Costly,"These Fein tool blades Cut very precisely for the uses for which they were intended. When cutting into wood near a wall or in tight spaces, it fits but those spaces usually may have nails or other obstructions which will tear up the blades quickly. There are no sawall type bimetal blades for cutting nail embedded wood yet. Can make the job expensive. Taking out an antique wideboard heartwood floor which I needed to put back in the same place, cost me over $600 in blades. Worked great but expensive.These Fein blades are still under patent but will be coming off in about a year. Then other can creat better blade products at a much more competitive price."
2,precision cut blade,get more life ... when the teeth break off use your dremel tool with a cut-off blade and cut new teeth in the steel and stop spending the big bucks for new blades. I do not often share this information....
2,"Good tool, poor blades","The Fein multimaster is a great tool for specialty cutting jobs, provided only cutting soft materials and limited use. I have had the same experience as other users. The tool operates much like (and could be substituted for) a Stryker surgical cast saw. However, the steel blades are expensive for their limited life. The carbide and diamond blades are better.This Fein tool has enabled a few jobs not possible with other tools, or saved considerable labor for some jobs (as opposed to the usual methods).But don't expect it to be a workhorse because of the limited life and special cut design of the steel blades. I have done limited blade sharpening touch-up using brasselerusa.com serrated diamond saw blades, but this is specialized/expensive equipment most tool users don't have. Sharpening would require very specialized sharpening equipment which apparently only Fein has at their factory. It is so sad that they do not offer blades make from more durable materials."
3,Over Priced,"While the Precision E Cut Blade cuts quite well, it is made out of high speed steel and not carbide tipped. For the price paid, you would think that this blade would last longer. Maybe there is another company out there that makes a blade for this tool at a cheaper price, but I have not found them yet. I like the idea from another user that uses his dremel tool with the cutoff wheel to re-grind new teeth into the worn out blade. While it is not as good as the original blade, it does seem to work marginally well."
4,A very Fein product!,This item comes in handy where others can't. My only wish is that it could be resharpened for the rather expensive cost.
1,"Fein = Awesome, Amazon = FAIL","I use Fein tools all the time - they are awesome at what they do, the problem is that Amazon are hopeless.They will ship your product using an untraceable ""Glabal Mail"" system, then LIE TO THIER CUSTOMERS when questioned about why their order has not arrived. Their staff use form letters that they fail to complete correctly, making it obvious that either the staff or Amazon (probably both) simply do not care about their customers that are international - any old nonsense will do.Fein - 5 stars, fabulous product, cannot rave highly enough about it.Amazon - FAIL totally in customer care, customer service, and plain old bad attitude."
4,You can't beat a fein product,You can't beat a fein product . . . I had had the multi-tool for over 20 years . . . it is as tough as nails. It does things that other tools only dream about and blades like this make it possible.
2,Useful; but way over priced and they dull really fast.,"As with all the ""multi Master"" blades this one is too expensive and dulls too fast. With all the ""knock offs"" out there I'm hopping that someone will soon make a cheaper group of blades that fit and are fairly priced."
1,Unimpressive,"I picked up this book thinking it would be a great read. Boy, was I disappointed. The characters are underdeveloped, and the book is trying too hard. The overuse of Brit language and the demoralization of Americans is overdone. Pick this book up if you need a doorstopper."
1,Poor,"Disappointing after Naylor's first novel. The characters in ""Catching Alice"" are unconvincing and two dimensional, the context poorly described, and the redemption theme hackneyed. I would have liked to get to know Alice better, she seems interesting, but was not given enough genuine development. I'm sure Naylor can do better."
3,alice's world is less than wonderland,"clare naylor has cheeky, very british sense of humour and so do all of her characters, even the americans. naylor appears to have some difficulty allowing the los angelenos to sound like los angelenos, rather than using british slang and terminology that they probably never heard before much less uttered. naylor also makes liberal use of foreshadowing, which isn't always bad, but is often confusing. the book itself was a quick, fun read, the kind of book that if you think about it too long afterward, you'll only be disappointed."
3,Reading with Tequila,"Catching Alice was a light and fluffy story of a British woman who heads for LA when she loses her house, man and job. The romance story line was kind of predictable. The job story line, focusing on public relations was really entertaining. I didn't like how unrealistically Alice came by the job though. Forty thousand dollar a year jobs in PR aren't often give to people with no experience or education simply because their not that powerful friend makes a call. It all seemed way too convenient. I was completely unaware, even after reading the book, that Catching Alice was supposed to be a re-invention of Alice Wonderland. I didn't see much comparison. Ultimately, Catching Alive was a breezy, although probably quite forgettable, chick lit novel."
2,Boring,I started this book after reading another Naylor's book. Dog Handling is much more better than this one. I even could not finish this book.
2,Pale imitation of Bridget Jones,"I'm not sure if this was published after the Bridget Jones phenomenon - but the author is trying to create the same kind of slightly klutzy, clueless, food-obsessed character. However, Alice is not nearly so endearing - it's hard to see why anyone would cross the pub to meet this poorly drawn character, let alone cross the Atlantic ocean and another continent - as her Irish suitor does. Too many silly implausibilities in the plot."
2,Alice is of little consequence,"If you want light fluff of underdeveloped, uninteresting characters (perhaps uninteresting BECAUSE they're underdeveloped) that doesn't ring true where Los Angeles or is concerned...read this. There are too many characters of little consequence, even the main character Alice is of little consequence. There is no character to identify with - even though I should easily have identified with Alice who has experienced a succession of events I have. I get no sense of who Alice is, let alone the world she occupies - even though I lived in L.A. for six years. Something tells me the author has never been to L.A."
4,"Sweet, Charming and Endearing","Clare Naylor has a way with really charming books. I was a huge fan of her first book ""Love: A User's Guide"" and greatly anticipated her newest work, ""Catching Alice"". I found it very easy to get into, and well worth my time. I read it in a few lunch hours and was greedy to finish up this little gem.Her carefree style is refreshing and very charming. I love this modern romance with twists and turns. I loved the characters and found it really easy on the romantic heart. I think you'll love it, if you're just out for a fun and harmless time."
4,Quirky story of London girl in L.A.,"I wanted it to be better, but finally settled for the humor and quirky story that it is. What you get is a pretty ordinary London girl escaping to L.A. with her old school chum running interference for her. As Alice blunders through Hollywood seeking solace after a lost boyfriend, she encounters and comments on California oddities from the British viewpoint.Her misunderstandings of the west coast way of life is entertaining. At times, the British slang descriptions or ways of thinking that the average American doesn't recognize hampers the story.Somewhat funny, somewhat romantic, not very realistic, but generally fun to read for chick lit fans. I'll try more Naylor books, but eagerly await more Kinsella's which I prefer."
1,Pheromone by Marilyn Miglin,"Well, I tried a sample of this a few years ago, and it was reasonable then. My husband said he liked the scent on me. So, I went ahead and ordered it here without trying another sample first. Apparently my body chemistry has changed, because it now smells like a first aid kit on me. It has a very medicinal smell with no redeeming qualities whatsoever."
1,"If you like the smell of your grandma, then this is for you","This is the most disgusting smell. I was shocked it smelled so vile with all the reviews. I normally like light, airy scents like from Bath and Body Works, Victoria's Secret, etc. This was reminescent of what old women used to wear from Estee Lauder when I was a kid. I had to throw it out because it was so disgusting. I couldn't even use it as an air freshener because it was so nasty. If you like old smells, then get it. Otherwise, the pheremone thing is a lie. You can pee on yourself and have 'pheremones' if that's what you want. Nasty."
1,Perfumne Never Arrived,I am very displeased that my perfume was never delivered but they took the money out of my account. I will dispute the charge with my bank.
5,Fragrance of Love,"When I wear this perfume, my husband follows me around the house. Are you a single lady who wants to get married? Wear this fragrance! A little bit goes a long way. It is lovely, floral and elegant. This is not for someone who wants to smell like a baby or a little girl. This is sexy."
1,DID NOT GET ORDER,"STATES I RECEIVED PRODUCT BUT I DID NOT!! RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT, BUT THEY WERE VERY GOOD TO TAKE MONEY OUT OF MY ACCOUNT! VERY UPSET . HOW CAN I FIX THIS CAN ANYONE HELP ME!!!"
1,PU,Not at all what I remembered and since I threw out the packaging I'm stuck. It is very strong and more than that the scent has a heavy scent that is more masculine to me.
1,Old-Lady Smell,"I bought some samples of this based on the name thinking it would be attractive to men. I tried it the day before a date with a guy who I really wanted to impress. I'm sooooo glad I tried it before the date and not the day of the date. The smell of it is so overpowering that it hurts my throat. There's no way that I would ever wear this anywhere. My samples went in the trash. I'm not a young woman but I'm not a grandmother, either. Always try colonge before you buy it. And don't wear it the first time someplace important."
2,Pherome by Marilyn Miglin,The scent was not what I expected and rather musky. Lesson Learned: Next time I will try to find the perfume in a store and test it before I buy it online.
1,STINKS ALMOST AS BAD AS WHITE DIAMONDS!!!,"After reading reviews on this product, I ordered a small sample first for about $3.00...boy am I glad I did!!! This is some serious grandma smelling stuff! I'm only 25 and boy did it immediately age me! White Diamond perfume is a 10 on the stink-o-meter and this stuff comes in at about an 8. Its a heavy scent so def all you need is a little but it just smells to old for me. YUCK! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
1,inacurate 45 angle cuts,"This saw cannot be adjusted to cut accurate 45 degree angle cuts.When its on at 90 degrees and then shifted to the 45 degree slot , it will be cutting a 44 or 43.5 degree cuts.I could not get it to cut accurately.It was necessary to make many cuts to get an acceptable joint.Would not recommend this saw to to anyone.I went through the adjustment procedure two times to make sure I wasn,t making any mistakes."
5,School will never be the same with Cam around...,"You have to love Cam Jansen. When you're a kid, you read all of these stories about magic powers, mystery, and adventure. But everyone tells you magic can't exist. Cam Jansen manages to solve every case without the use of magic... she's a real girl. That's what makes her special and what makes you want to red more and more. Cam Jansen is a real kid superhero, and the thought that a person like her could actually exist... makes her the best kid detective ever! Our family loves Cam Jansen!"

4,In Tasmania,This book is primarily historically oriented on the development of Tasmania. It does provide valuable insight on many different aspects of the land.
1,"Questionable Entertainment, Very Little Education","Typical of the stuff that passes for education these days.The old Electric Company was priceless, this stuff is clueless."
4,fannie annie,i have seen this movie and i am looking for any other movies starring (the big woman)FANNIE ANNIE. CAN ANYONE HELP ME?
4,Jay Summer is a god trapped in a man's body,"The film debut of Jay Summer can best be described as nothing short of brilliant and stunning. When the would-be actor first was cast as the titilating ""Jason"" in Summer Job, the rest of the movie's crew was agast as this was the firsr real acting job for the Hollywood fledgling. But as the plot thickened, it was obvious that the young Summer was a perfect fit for the young Cowboy in love. His career has blossemed since and has only aged like fine wine. Other cast members will agree, the movie will long live in Teen ""coming of age"" movie history as a statement for that tender young age when we all fine our first job, first love and all during our first REAL Summer."
1,Waste of paper and ink,"An abject waste of paper and ink - much less the time and energy of those involved in its creation. A patched together storyline that's patched together very badly, to the extent that the art is not enough to save it. A product not worthy of the collective talent of those involved in its creation and production. Certainly does not live up to the standards of the franchise that spawned the character."
1,Be careful,"In a recent workshop, the author was quoted in saying the the students who are reluctant or shy to participate in his activities are, ""Punks and Knuckleheads,"" and that he believes that we should, ""Blow their (the children's) minds,"" with these activities, especially the activities involving touch. He expressed a gross insensitivity to abused children and who are introverted or come from quiet, reserved families. The author may know group facilitation and dynamics but lacks the sensitivity to apply his work in a school setting. The author also displayed minimal knowledge of the psychology and biology of learning and and how they are founded his his activities."
3,Herbal Tea,I'm not quite sure what to write about this product. It's suppose to do some healthy stuff for you. I'm not there yet.
5,excellent,"GREAT FLAVOR!Steep with green tea to make iced tea. Not bitter. Great way to drink the healthy, detoxifying benefits of parsley."
4,Pleasant taste! Healthy tea!,"I purchased this tea after reading about its healthy properties in a magazine. I love the taste of this tea! I have not yet seen any health benefits, but I do know being an herbal tea that it is probably good for you! Very reasonable price, too! If you are looking to add variety to your teas, I would definitely give this one a try!"
5,Finding an old friend.,"I was given a copy of this book over 30 years ago. In the process of several moves, it disappeared. I'm glad to have it back again."
4,Need to use more,I've not used this much yet and this is the first retractable reel I have ever owned. It works pretty well except at times there is a certain point in the retracting process that it is slow in reeling the hose up. It just may need for the spring tension to be adjusted. I'll revisit this review after I do that.I've used this now for 3+ months and I really like it. The only negative I've found is on cold days (Below 40) it is slow rolling the hose back in which I contribute to the hose being too stiff. A more supple hose would make this much better!
2,What was I thinking??,"... I was expecting something MUCH higher in quality. I open the thing up and there is no tension whatsoever, with line just flowing out when I pull. Turns out the side tensioning plate was supposed to have two screws holding it in. So I shake the box and two dinky screws bounce around. I had to use two of my own, larger, screws to hold the plate as the holes for the original screws were stripped. Then, they give you a 'whopping' 3 or so feet of hose to attach to your compressor, like that's EVER going to be enough. So, every single person that buys this has to go out and buy another stretch of hose, with all the right fittings, to attach their compressor to this reel. If I had bought it locally, I'd just return it and get my money back. Folks, my recommendation is that you just buy a 50' or 75' hose and deal with the hassle."
4,Works Great,"Works great. It does run small. I have a 36 inch waist and had to get a large. The medium would not ""meet""."
1,Binder,This item did not work at all for me. It started to roll immediately after putting it on. Not wide enough if you have a long torso.
1,PRODUCT PROVIDES NO GUIDANCE FOR ORDERING PROPER SIZE,"FUTURO HAS THIS PRODUCT BACK IN THE SAME PRISTINE CONDITION THAT I RECEIVED IT ALONG WITH MY MONEY THAT WAS USED TO PURCHASE IT. THEY PROVIDED NO INSTRUCTION FOR ON LINE USERS ABOUT MASURING AND HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO MY EXPLANATION FOR WHAT HAPPENED AND HAVE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO CONTACT ME. I WOULD LIKE THIS PRODUCET IN A SIZE THAT WOULD WORK FOR ME OR MY MONEY BACK. I CERTAINLY DON'T FEEL COMPANY THIS SIZE NEEDS TO EARN THEIR MONEY BY CHEATING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY.TtHIS PRODUCT WAS MAILED BACK TO THEIR WAREHOUSE WITH A LETTER DATED ONE DAY AFTER I RECEIVED IT. (JANUARY 29, 2013)"
3,These binders run a bit small,I ordered a medium which according to the product description is a 32 to 42 inch binder. It does not fit that range. If you are close to the upper end of that range go a size bigger. They are also a fairly narrow binder. They measure about 7 3/4 inches wide. This binder may be the right thing for some users but did not work out well for me.
4,"Surgical Binder & Abdominal Support, Large (40 to 46-Inch)","If you have a waist close to 46in. this is the binder you want to get, it holds you in very good, so healing can take place. If your waist is closer to the 48-50in. range get the next one up in size other wise it has a tendency to roll and is hard to keep straight. I made the mistake and got one of each size and should have gotten two 40-46in. size. It doesn't roll so much, and just remember to take it off and wash it at least every other day because it looses it's shape. Let it dry flat not in a dryer. so it keeps its shape to hold you in."
1,not as advertised,"The product was supposedly designed to fit an abdomen size of 42-52 inches. My size is 44, (yeah, I don't want to hear about it, thank you)! and I could hardly stretch the support enough to get it around me! Much too tight when I did! Not at all satisfactory. I didn't try to return it since I had used it, much as an undergarment is not returnable, although the support never touched my skin. I guess I will have to buy a corset of some sort designed for males ( I hope)!"
5,Highly recommend this binder!,"I absolutely love this abdominal binder. I have purchased other brands in the past, only to have them fold over, ride up, and not do what they were intended to. This one stays put and provides a much more consistent support. I highly recommend this one. In fact, I will be ordering my second one shortly!"
3,Too focused on plants instead of troughs,"I was disappointed in this book for many reasons. I was looking for a resource on how to create different shapes, depths and sizes of hypertufa troughs. This book focused on fairly shallow, square troughs. Because most of the trough photographs were in black and white, it was difficult for a beginner to visualize how a finished product should look. Too much of the book was focused on the type of plants you can grow in troughs. I feel a trough is just a container with unique characteristics and was hoping for information on the kinds of problems trough gardners face and how to deal with those problems. I gave the book a 3 rating because chapter 2 - 'Constructing A Hypertufa Trough' was well done. Even with the lack of color photographs in this chapter, you will know how to create a small, square trough. If you are looking for creative trough ideas this is not the book."
3,Not really that strong of an Electric Impact,"I had been using a 1/2 drive electric impact that I purchased from Harbor Freight. I figured I would buy this Dewalt 3/4 impact to remove the stubborn stuff, that the other one would not handle. But this is not really any better than the one I was using before. I guess when you need to remove the really tough stuff, you have to go with the air impacts, or spend the big bucks and buy the really expensive electric impacts."
4,Very good clock radio at an excellent price,"This clock radio has lived up to the other reviews written about it. I ordered it because of the reviews. I would like to add that the numbers are large enough that even though I am very near sighted without my glasses I can squint a little and still read the time in the middle of the night without having to put on my glasses. The only slightly negative feature for me is the inability to dim the display. All in all, I would purchase again."
5,"Great clock radio, no fuss, perfect","This is a great clock radio. The numbers are easy to read, even from the other side of the bed without glasses. The buttons are easy to use, and having a daylight saving time switch means you just flip a switch twice a year for DST. Dual alarm settings are convenient if you have to switch from an early shift to a late shift and back. The only bummer is that the analog radio reception isn't great on weak stations, but it does the job."
2,Great Clock Radio - While it Lasts,"Like so many of the reviews I read before I bought this clock radio, I was very impressed with the features of this product. Just the fact that it knows the time as soon as you plug it in is pretty impressive. The weekend off function was also a feature that really was nice. However....I got this clock radio a day or two before New Years and it worked fine until the first week of February. Suddenly, almost none of the features work. The alarm no longer functions in either the radio or alarm mode, the radio no longer works and neither the sleep nor nap functions work. Since the alarm does not work, I don't know whether the weekend mode is functional or not. It does still keep excellent time, and still looks pretty good on my night stand.Did I just get a dud or is this a common problem? I wish I had that answer."
5,Excellent Choice,"Purchased this alarm clock a while back, I am very impressed with the features of this alarm clock. This clock does it all. Even if you want to take a nap, it will be sure you don't over sleep with it's own nap button. It takes some getting use to setting it, and it takes a while getting use to what is what with the buttons too. (Keep the instructions near by you will need them) But it's feature rich. The ONLY thing I was disapointed in was the speakers, but because I didn't buy it for a good radio to listen too , I gave it five stars anyway for the alarm features, because that is why I bought it in the first place."
1,Nice design but got a lemon,"After reading customer reviews of this product I decided to order it. It was fine for a couple weeks , but then I began to hear soft intermintent crackeling static (the radio is not on) sound around the same time each day at the time when I'm going to sleep. This is unaceptable for a brand new product. The last clock radio (Panasonic) I had lasted more than 30 years before it began to malfunction. I must say I was disapointed and have since returned it for a refund."
3,"A workable clock, but not what I expected","The key reason I bought this clock was for the 'Auto Time Set' feature. This clock does NOT have auto time set. Not really. For auto time set, I expected it to listen to the atomic clock transmitted from Boulder, CO. I have other clocks that does this, and I don't find it unreasonable to have a clock radio that would accomplish this.This clock just had its time set at the factory, and some batteries installed so it doesn't lose the time. If you set the clock to the wrong time, it will not auto-correct. If you lose power and do not have the batteries installed, it will flash 12:00, just like every other standard clock-radio.This product is nothing special, and I regret this decision, expecting to have a clock that was smarter than its competition."

5,Exactly what I wanted,"This is the most convenient alarm clock radio I've found, with the most appropriate set of features. For our family, this has become a truly ""set it and forget it"" device. I've always been a check, double-check, and triple-check the alarm kind of person, I no longer do that. I'll occasionally just take a look at the comforting display lights.We used to use a Sony Dreamcube with a single alarm (and dim display) - I had to set every night after resetting in the morning for my wife (who gets up an hour after me). This exercise is no longer required. I also don't have to worry each night whether or not I set for AM or PM (I mad that mistake more than once on the Sony).So far it's been 6 months of trouble-free operation. We liked the gradual awake so much I bought the single alarm version for my pre-teen daughter."
4,interesting round alarm clock.,This is one good looking alarm clock. I like the unique roundness with lots of buttons to press. GE makes cool stuff.
1,The WORST user experience ever,"This is the single hardest to use appliance I have ever purchased. The controls and alarm set are cryptic at best. You'd think since I have a Master's in Human Factors I could figure this thing out, but it's just terrible. I plan on smashing it as soon as I buy a new one.In additon, the display is so bright you have to turn the clock away to sleep.Look elsewere folk, because this think is bad."
5,Love it,Extremely user friendly and doesn't tug out hair as some of these brushes do. The metal base heats to a good temperature and is really effective without damaging hair.
5,A perfect yoga book!,"I've wanted to have this book since I saw it in Amazon.com. Then when I went to a bookstore in Sydney, I saw it, open it, and fell in love with it. Then I bought it, and in the middle of winter night read and practiced some of the movements. I felt this familiar tranquility and stillness and I realised... I've found my book of yoga...So important this book for me that I decided to order one for my friends in my ashram in Indonesia. So that many more women will be blessed knowing their own bodies and minds, and eventually overcome them to be with the Oneness."
5,Yoga for Women by Shakta Kaur Khalsa,"This book is like having a wise friend and yoga teacher nearby at all times. There are yoga sets to complement all phases of a woman's life and to nurture her along the way. A great feature of the book is that there are options within the sets, so no matter what my available time frame is, I always find a nourishing practice. To optimize the benefits, I highly recommend accompanying the text with the CD, ""Women's Yoga Music,"" compiled by Shakta Kaur Khalsa. Shakta references this companion CD in many of the beautiful meditations and practices in the book. I find this brings such depth to the ""at home"" yoga experience. From the bottom of my heart, I recommend this book to all women!"
5,A Solid Resource for Introduction Into British Militaria,"I have literally memorized this book as I have poured over the pictures contained within attempting to gain a grasp of what items were used doing the period. The extent of detail in the pictures is astounding. My only negative critiques are that some rare items are only given a single photo (officer's valise and wire cutters/web pouch) and that the captions do not go into enough detail and background of many items. (I.E., the officer's valise, info on binoculars, and different manufacturers of clothing and web gear.) While I will DEFINATELY purchase their future volume on North Africa and SE Asia, I hope they go into more detail of non-uniform items. This book is a great gift idea and should be on the shelf of any WWII British militaria collector/historian's library."
4,Very good if unadventurous,"This is my first viewing of a film by Mikio Naruse and I was very favorably impressed. He is/was extremely economical in his approach to film making and this is both a strength and perhaps also something of a weakness. Additionally, I hope all his films are not as humorless as this one is.As I watched this filmed I was reminded of Fellini's classic, Nights of Cabiria. Keiko and Cabiria are very similarly circumstanced, as another reviewer has noted. The scene about two-thirds of the way through the film when Keiko is pictured briefly standing before a bar named Cabiria in Tokyo's Ginza district appears to be Naruse's way of paying homage to Fellini. But this film and Nights of Cabiria are not in the same league. Where Fellini was more willing (and able) to show rather than tell, Naruse's treatment of this material, spare though it is, is also almost wholly lacking in nuance."
3,a nice film,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.""When a Woman Ascends the Stairs"" released originally as ""Onna ga kaidan wo agaru toki"" is about a bar hostess who entertains white collar workers in the evenings.The film was not widely released in the US originally but remains a popular Japanese release.The DVD contains an interview with Tatsuya Nakadai, a theatrical trailer and an interview with Japanese film scholar Donald Richie."
5,courage,"An underrated film. A gentle story of an ageing Japanese woman who must come to terms about her state in life, getting old, little financial security, a family that makes demands on her.The principal comes to terms with all these with grace and fortitude. It is not just of a Japanese woman, but all women who must be dependent on a world which requires, skills, youth or fortune, but she carries it off with such charming fortitude that at the end, you end up with deep admiration for her."
4,An Unjustly Neglected Master,"When a Woman Ascends the Stairs is not one of Mikio Naruse's best films, but it is quite good enough to show anyone unfamiliar with his work what a sensitive and uncompromising filmmaker he is. Just as Ozu devoted most of his work to the disintegration of the Japanese family, Naruse concentrated almost invariably on the lives of women in Japanese society. His films are often sad and his 'endings' are somewhat less than uplifting, but when you watch, in When a Woman Ascends the Stairs, his heroine (played beautifully by Hideko Takamine) betrayed by the men she turns to for help and/or salvation, it becomes clear that Naruse was a great director - not as versatile as Mizoguchi, but unjustly neglected."
5,After a year of use ...,"OK, I admit that I am a sucker for the Leica name, but hey, it has meant quality and incredible optics for a very long time, so I had little difficulty choosing this camera last year when I decided to finally go digital. After one year of use, I have nothing but praise for this camera. Although I pine a bit for the Digilux 2, I am not ready to trade my Digilux 1 in and pay the premium. As a digital rangefinder, with excellent automatic and manual aspects, I have been able to satisfy both sides of my hobby: the snapshot photographer and the advanced hobbiest artist. The pictures I produce using this camera are stunning; the colors dense and true, and their ability to be manipulated in Photoshop a breeze. I highly recommend this camera to anyone considering it ... at this price, you're getting a bargain!"
5,The beauty of rural,"I grew up in a big city. Now study in a small college town for my Ph.D. degree. If I had never lived in the rural area, I would never understand the wild beauty that rest within. Gregory Spaid's captured the essence of the rural beauty: It's wildness, tranquility as well as livelihood."
1,head rest,"poor. why? HARD! i had my head on it for a very short time. maybe it took about 15 seconds for my cheek flesh to feel pain as the weight of my head pressed my cheeks against the hard ungiving edge. also it is PlAsTiC and there is no ""breathing"" maybe this is good for an athelet who is under 25 and is fit and is on the table for a brief time to get maintenance or tweeking and off he goes. he is already sweating and jaked up on endomorphines from exercise or sport. he could take a punch in the face and shake it off. but if you need a PT treatment that requires somone to put pressure on your back and that puts prssure on the back bone and the neck bone and then the face goes down some more into the ""pillow"" then it is uncomfortable to the point of pain. it is $85 down the toilet. like to return it if it is possible."
5,Good Book overall,Really nice book. Used it for my art and film class in college.Many useful information regarding the art of the film indastry. Thank you
1,"Horrible, horrible","This is perhaps THE WORST TEXTBOOK I have EVER had to use. If you eliminate Bordwell and Thompson's constant derivations discussing the most tedious unrelated, obscure film references; then there would be about FIVE pages of text. In those five pages, you would see several paragraphs of horribly akward phrasing and lack of definitions for their 'coined terms.' Do youself a favour and petition your Film Department to get a text that is actually readable and not this horrible."
3,Great food but makes your water turbid,"I bought this food for my mollies since they need a vegetable diet and they love it. They are healthy and having tons of babies. The downside is that it will make your water turbid. When I feed them with regular Tetra Min the water is very clear, but every time we feed them the Veggie Flakes the water turns turbid for a few hours. This doesn't seem to affect the fish and if you have a good filtration system it goes away."
4,Great 80's rockabilly along the same lines as the Stray Cats,"This is some 1st class 80's rockabilly, mixed with a little touch of western swing. Similar in many ways to The Stray Cats, but Polecats do have thier own sound. The 1st 12 or so songs are great and sound very 1950's, but the bonus tracks, from track 14 to 19, are mostly throwaways, and are just 80's pop. The original is made up from the 1st 13 or so tracks and that is all tha treally needed to be put onto cd, hpwever diehard fans might enjoy the extra tracks, I just program my cd player not to play them. The highlight of this cd is a cover of Les Paul & Mary Ford's huge 50's hit ""How High The Moon"", which was a hit for Ella Fitzgerald even before Paul & Ford, made it a hillbilly bop classic. This cd should be considered essential for those who like 80's rockabilly along the lines of The Stray Cats and Robert Gordon. Very fun lighthearted music."
4,vac 9036000 craftsman filter,"the filter only fits tightly over sealing service. does not use support rod and nut. looked specs and it says it fits my model, so i tried it and liked it. you can get a better price from Cleanstream direct, apporixamatly $20 cheaper. this is surprising sense amazon is usaly the cheapest."
1,"Mislabeled, misleading, wrong photo.","I saw a CleanStream filter like the one pictured on this listing in a store. Using Amazon's bar code scanner on my phone I scanned it and this listing came up. It was significantly cheaper including shipping so I ordered one. They sent me a regular bottom-of-the-line Craftsman brand filter in a Craftsman box. NOT HEPA. NOT CleanStream. Not by GORE as listed. It fit my vacuum, but was not what I was expecting. The seller blamed Amazon for the error. They did refund the purchase price. They reportedly do not carry the CleanStream filters."
1,Great if it would have fit my Sears vacuum...,"I bought a Sears vacuum (this year, I hope it's a current model) and this filter did not fit. It should list the models it actually fits."
1,Really?,"This writing is so typical of fiction I can not believe the author was a journalist. I was expecting something more convincing, like a factual account not a novel,"
2,Weakest of the trilogy...,"The whole trilogy is just ok. Only read this trilogy if you cannot for some reason find buy or borrow any of Mercedes Lackey's Valdimar / Last Herald Mage series.Magic's Pawn (The Last Herald-Mage Series, Book 1)"
2,An essay on tolerance camoglaged as fantasy story,"I found the first book in this series entertaining, not great or original, but a decent story to pass the time. As a result, I held no great expectations for this story, however, I was still dissapointed. I have never read a book with an established protagonist and storyline that devoted so much page space to the development of the relationship of sidecharacter and the progression of a marginal subplot. If the author wishes to espouse tolerance of alternative lifestyles, there are other more appropriate pulpits from which to preach. While the overall story still manages to be coherant, it lacks focus and impact."
3,little slow,"A good story, but at a slow pace. I'm sure I'll read the next book just to finish the series."
3,Pretty Good,"This is a pretty good sequel.Sonea is a little bit of a wimp and I am hoping the third book allows her to grow out of that. Overall this is a decent fantasy novel, but I would reccomend reading the first book before tackling this one."
2,Disappointing sequel,"I enjoyed the first book. I wouldn't call it great literature, but it was mostly a fun, light read. The second book, however, was dull. The lengthy and repetitive moralizing about gay rights seemed out of place in this book, and the subplot about Dannyl discovering his true feelings for his handsome assistant took far too much time. But, sadly enough, when the plot switched back to Sonea, the novel did not improve. Her continued hiding from the rest of the students, led by the school bully, coupled with her fear to fight back and unwillingness to call the Administrator or other friendly adults for help during the many vicious attacks, made her character far less appealing than in book one.I picked up the first two books half price at a local bookstore that was closing. I doubt I'll buy the third, though I might borrow it from the library if possible just to see how the tale ends."
3,This book was a little slow,"I like the premise of the series, but the author spends too much time moralizing on social issues."
5,Wondefrul read,This book was just as hard to put down as the 1st one. I am a little sad that I have to wait for book three.
4,A little better.....,"This book was a little better than the first. However, I did not care much for Lord Dannyl's journey which included him discovering his same sex attaction. Overall, I did not see what his character brought to the story. Aside from that I like much of what was written."
5,really good read,the Black Magician Trilogythese 3 books were the best fantasy novels I have read for a long time.The characters are believable and likeable and I felt almost like this was fact not fiction haha!
2,Noisless but not Troublefree,I like the fact that it's truly silent which is why I ordered it. But It kept shutting my system down abruptly intermittently. Before installing this Power supply I had my system running on a 350 Watt noisy power supply without problems so I have to attribute the shutdown problem to Zalmans power supply.
2,peice of junk,"i dont understand how a company like toshiba can put out a crappy product like this FAKE DTV not HDTV i read a few of the reveiws before i baugth the tv ""bite my tounge"" i come home and i get the same issues slanted to the left a bit the hd content is so poor i can only have my cable box set to 480p for it to work properly 1080I gives me a white line across the top and a blurred image i think i might return this to sears and get a samsung lcd. if u just want the tv for the size and not the qaulity go right ahead"
1,a cultic favorite ... I hope not,"What this book needs most is a continuity editor to keep the physical descriptions compatible. It would help if the characters had plausible motivations for their actions. It would help if the basics of every day life - the manditory duties of the priest, the caring for the sheep - were in the general vicinity of accurate. It would help if the book had a cohesive view of the magic, ritual, hallucinagenic substances, reincarnation etc. that make up the core of the plot.It should be obvious that I don't care for this coming-of-age, gay masochist novel. What makes it most frustrating is that here and there one reads flashes of excellent writing - enough so that this book may have an historical place in gay erotica. But for general reading, save your ""to read stack"" for better materials."
4,Mantis Richard La Plante,"Well written and arresting but I would not recommend this book for emotionally well balanced people. It makes Silence of the Lambs look like a fairy tale.Reminds me of Von Lustbader's earlier works. Graphic violence, raw sex,serial killer all adds up to a read which keeps you to the end in order to find out what happens to the sicko protaganist."
5,"Mantis (Purchased on October 3, 2012) by Richard La Plante",Hannibal meets the world of Martial Arts. Very good book. well thought out and very well researched. Potrays more of the old school martial arts mentality from the 70s and 80s.
4,Good Read,"An exciting action adventure. A very good read. I thought the first Tanaka/Fogerty book was better, but it had more one on one action. This one was also very good as it explained so much of the culture and heritage of the Japanese martial arts.Time well spent reading it."
1,WHAT?!,"I own the Multimaster, great tool well built. But...This and every other accessory are overpriced to the point of obscenity. $160 for a case is ridiculous."
4,Solid Exterior! Soft Interior,"Amazon sent a case that didn't have the accessories that was listed in the product description, However they did give me a 50% refund!The exterior of the case is solid,the interior is sort of cheap plastic, however it fit my multimaster & accessories perfect!"
1,ITEM NOT AS DESCRIBED,"Item received did not contain the accessories as described. Not sure if the description is wrong, or the seller sent something else. I was not happy with the lesser accessories. Item described would have been worth the money, but item received was a rip-off."
5,Easy to read... hard to put down. Worth reading twice!,"Great book for all touched by adoption. Robert Andersen's book is compelling, thought provocative, and worth reading twice. Helpful not only to adoptees, but also for prospective adoptive parents seeking to understand the impact of adoption on their children. I found it an extremely insightful story. Easy to read... hard to put down. Excellent!"
5,Uller Uorising,This is my second copy of this book as I have worn out the first copy from rereading so many times. It is classic SF but it holds up very well in todays world.
4,Not quite Spilling Open...,"Didn't you hate it when you turned in an essay for class that you knew was better than all of the other kids', but your teacher still gave you a ""B"" because you didn't quite live up to *your potential*? Enter Brave on the Rocks. It's a great book-- fun and quirky-- but it's not quite Spilling Open (SWH's first book). I love Sabrina's style and crazy wit, but Brave on the Rocks lacks the soul and intimacy of her earlier work. I'm hesitant to say anything critical of Sabrina's work because I admire her in so many ways, but I think both the art and the writing in Brave on the Rocks fall short of the author's potential-- as we saw in the AMAZING Spilling Open. Nevertheless-- Brave on the Rocks is still a daring work with few books that can even compare. Please support this wonderful, adventurous artist! Buy this book-- and her first one too!"
4,Self-discovery is the most important thing,"Maybe the people who were bashing this book are the kind of people who don't care about self-discovery or self-realization. I don't think her intent was to save the world with ""Brave on the Rocks"" and it's a mistake that her books are sometimes in the self-help section at the bookstore-- I consider her books to be INSPIRATION and ART! These books are journals, people, and what else do you write about in your journal but yourself? There's so much beauty in her words and art, she makes you feel like getting out the old paintbrushes and writing your thoughts. That to me is a beautiful thing. The only criticism I have about this book is that she seemed to hold back her feelings a lot more, she didn't ""Spill Open"" as vulnerably as she did in her first book. But that is her perogative. Basically, like Sabrina said, we need more ORDINARY people writing books-- by being ourselves, we find out that we are all uniquely EXTRAORDINARY!"
2,shameless self-promotion & egocentrism,"art is good. good art is great. Commercially focused, self-conscious analysis is at best analogized as photocopy of of a photograph of Warhol's Campbell's soup can--sold by a non-english-speaking street vendor in Cambodia. My point? This is a mockery of a sham of a travesty of a hoax of a fraud of a sham. Please people, her books serve as giant advert-tainments that drive sales of her slapdash stichings from her website. This is like a straight girls Morrisey for clothing/painting/scribbling. A virtuoso of her own neuroses. She plays that one note beautifully. Now, let's get on about the business of enlightenment, shall we?"
1,So bad Amazon reminded me that I bought it,I had this book for a Human Resources/Organizational Behavior class and it was so bad i didn't even remember that i had bought it. I remember the two other texts that i used for that class so this one was the downer.
4,Good day pack,"Overall this is a good day pack. Bladder holds plenty of water to last all day. Pack has plenty of room to hold everything you need for a day hike. Lunch, jacket, accessories, etc. I marked it down from 5 stars for two minor complaints. The shoulder straps don't attach directly to the pack, so there's a slight lump where they sit under the D ring, so they can get slightly uncomfortable with a heavy load and a full day's use. Also the waist strap is too narrow with not enough padding where it sits on your hips. These two things are not overly uncomfortable, but they are noticeable after a long day."
4,Good look into Al Qaeda,"This book gives a very deep picture of Al Qaeda and its cells around the world. It goes into detail about the organization and leadership of the group, and also gives some background on the ideology. Rated 4 because it is constantly jumping around chronologically, making the history difficult to understand at times."
3,Informative with one major omission..,"Where's KSM?The book overlooks Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the uncle of Ramzi Yousef, leader in the 1993 WTC bombing. There's no mention of his emergence into global terrorism, his efforts with Yousef in the Philippines (Project Bojinka, 1995) and his masterminding of the 9/11 attacks.Perhaps the revised version includes him?"
3,an OK read M.A,"Inside Al Qaeda was one of the best books about Al Qaeda and the new threat of terrorism that I have ever read. Seeing, as it is the only book on Al Qaeda I have ever read. Gunaratna's writing showed me the vastness of terrorism, how it has reached others throughout the world, how I never knew about this kind of terrorism earlier in my life. The book is very detailed in facts and the chapters are quite complex like, but still understandable in some ways. I would recommend reading this book to learn about this new threat of terrorism and or if you want to learn more about Al Qaeda."
1,publicity stunt,"This book is very disappointing, as is most of Gunaratna's work on islamist terrorism. It's the sort of stuff governments and many of the public want to hear, ie. bin Laden and AQ are everywhere, responsible for every terrorism attack and all regional terorist groups (such as JI) are AQ franchises - total bollocks. The book lacks solid and verifiable reserach and is written by a ""scholar"" who spends most of his time doing alarmist media commentary."
3,Good Overview,"Rohan Gunaratna scrutinizes this worldwide terrorist organization and its theater of operations country by country. He examines Al Qaeda's reach, strategic and tactical threat, mind-set, and messianic culture. There are some suggestions of ways given on ways that the international community could counter this movement. The book is written based on five years or interviews, research, and travel."
3,A basic description of current events,"I read this book in the summer of 2003. At the time it was probably the first book I read on the Al Qaeda and violent Islamic fundamentalism. I was initially impressed with the references, even though they interrupted the flow of the book and made it read more like a textbook. Since then every other book on the Al Qaeda and/or violent modern day jihadists has been more informative, both in the areas of description and in thought provoking conjecture and predictions."
1,Infinitely Pathetic Book,"It's ok if you are ignorant. And it's ok if you write a book. It's just not ok if you are an ignorant and write a book at the same time. As the previous reviewer mentioned, the author confuses many concepts not to mention straight linguistic symantics in Arabic like the ""ulama"" and ""umma"" words. This author knows nothing about the subject he is addressing. He cooks up stories out of nowhere and presents them as facts. The very few correct information pieces is stuff we already know from the media. If there were less than one star, this book deserves it. I returned my book as well.Dont buy this ""book""!"
5,Not just interesting ... Amazing,To me this one belongs to the hall of fame of Rock Albums for these songs :04. Search07. Those Around You09. Brown.
1,Don't Waste Your Money On These Dinosaurs,These guys are over the Hill! They're trying to be young and hip.Justin Wright is 35! That's ancient! Give us a break and leavethe recording of rock to the young. Thank You.
1,Less filling ...,"Sorry Grizzly, this is simply not a good effort on your part! The metal walls are incredibly thin for something supposed to be heavy duty. I expected at least 1/4"" but instead it is less than 1/8"" thick. The welds are okay but the overall design leaves much to be desired. The casters are sure to be troublesome as they do not have ball-bearings in the wheel hubs but bushings instead - that will make moving anything heavy a greater chore. The extension tubes do not mate with the corner brackets very snuggly and have lots of slop in them. And the real kicker - if this is the model that is capable of carrying 1200# then what the heck is the G7314 made out of? I think the Delta Universal Mobile Base has fittings every bit as strong as what is included here and maybe even more so. And Delta rates this base at only 300# capacity! Very disappointed and highly recommend you think twice before making a purchase."
1,Junk,I bought 6 of these for the tools in my shop 6 monthe ago. Casters are bad. I have had 2 wheels crumble. Metal bodies are cheap....STAY AWAY
1,Really Marginal for any Serious Use,"I only wish I had read the previous reviews before I bought this base. Grizzly should drop the ""Super"" and ""Heavy"" from the title. I have a low-end Delta table saw on mine (less than 200 pounds) and the cheap plastic caster wheels disintegrated after just a few months use. Also, as mentioned the metal is thin and poorly fitted and the bolts are cheap pot metal and strip easily.This base is not suitable for any application I can envision."
2,Wheels are not heavy enough,This item is rated to over 1300 lbs. With a 650 lb. machine on it the wheels will barely turn on a concrete surface.Steve
4,Nice funiture for the price.,"I have bought mostly Sauder furniture. I believe the quality of this furniture to be better. My husband usually puts together the furniture (desks, loftbeds, cabinents, etc.) I have occasionally taken on easier items, like this bookshelf. The furniture color itself was very nice. There was a couple of little nicks but nothing really noticible once it was put together. It was so easy to put together by myself. When I was attaching the second long side I used a box and a pillow to prop it up until I was able to secure it in the proper place. All I needed was a Phillips screwdriver for the main pieces and a hammer for the back piece. Instructions are easy to follow and the assembly is not complicated at all. The thing I liked most was how thick the shelves are. Very sturdy and since the bookshelf itself is narrow, you can easily put thicker books on the shelf. I wish I needed another one because it looks that good and is very functional."
4,A Wonderful Text,"I used this book as a student in my 10th grade chemistry course, and I enjoyed it immensely. This book develops concepts in a manner that makes them easy to understand and the chapter progression builds well on pervious lessons. The example problems provide clear and thorough steps to follow. My only complaint is that the homework questions sometimes have very little to do with the actual chapter, sometimes being about things that are not covered anywhere in the book. I highly recommend that you also purchase the student study guide, which gives many invaluable practice problems. It saved my life on many tests! All in all, this is one of the best science texts I have used."
2,Buy gloves instead,"I was using these to carry 8' x 4' drywall. It ended up being more trouble than it was worth. Maybe they would be more useful for different size sheets or other flat materials but both my neighbor and I agree, just get a pair a gloves and skip this product for drywall."
4,Excellent thought piece,"This book presents some basic thoughts at the beginning discussing the advantages and disadvantages of small layouts, then offers several layouts which vary from simple ""L""'s to whole bedroom layouts. The focus is primarily on shelf and waterwing layouts. The plans are well thought out, and the author does a nice job of drawing out his vision of how the structures should be sited, how to treat the backdrop for different scenes, etc. The only thing about this book that bothers me is that on at least two layouts, the binding of the book blocks part of the track plan - a definite negative if you should decide to build one of these plans."
3,Deceptive Title,"Nice track plans and concepts, but there only a couple of SMALL track plans in this book. If you really want SMALL track plans, check out the other track plan books such as the Atlas #6 and #7 books if you want N scale or the HO versions. Much less expensive and small, although nowhere near the nice concepts in this book.101 Track Plans is also good."
5,Iain Rice is a Master Layout Designer,"Please examine Mr. Rice's Layout designs, as EVERY Detail is fully thought out as depicted in his renderings. Magical!"
4,Lo Chiamavano King (His Name was King) Soundtrack Review,"This is the soundtrack to Lo Chiamavano King aka ""His Name was King"". (1971 Spaghetti western). The film features Klaus Kinski (Nosferatu) in a supporting role.This album, released in limited quantities, is likely to appeal to fans of Luis Bacalov, the composer, but also to fans of italian film music.Though widely touted as not being too memorable, the music also features in the opening movie of the Rockstar PS2 game, Red Dead Revolver, and is featured again in the ""Annie's Ranch"" level.As a result of its re-use, it has a degree of new-found popularity.Aside from the excellent Main Theme, which is presented a number of times, both as instrumental and vocal versions, the other themes may be of less interest to the casual listener.This CD also features music from two other Bacalov-scored films, which widely contrast with the pulsing theme from ""Lo Chiamavano King"".A non-widely available gem."
4,"Good scenarios, but would have liked more new unit types.","Purchasing this used was well worth the money. Some of the scenarios are way too easy, while some of them are really hard. Once in a while the game will glitch but it usually only happens rarely and can be fixed by re-starting the scenario. I have enjoyed playing this."
3,Battle Tactics,"Well, everyone says it's a useless expansion. If that's true, than this is the best useless expansion I've had. This adds 4 mission sets for ARM and Core, so 8 in all, and there are at least 15 missions in each. If you like campaign, then this for you. If not, then, well, you need it to play online, so it's better to have it anyways. It's not even that expensive. It's typically about 4 or 5 dollars plus shipping. Mine was a penny. Literally. I paid 399 times more for the shipping then the product. $4 in all. Need anymore information, go to TAUniverse. They'll tell you anything else you need to know..."
4,"Fine Recording, But Get The Beaux Arts","The five volumes (thus far) of Haydn's Complete Piano Trios by Trio 1790 are perfectly fine recordings of these great works. However, for less than the combined price of these five volumes, you can purchase the Beaux Arts Trio's 9-CD set of these works in a lovely, space saving, slim paper box. Those performances have been without peer since their initial release in the 1970s. CPO usually concentrates its efforts on issuing digital recordings of lesser-known works outside of the standard repertoire, and they do a commendable job of it. In many cases, this provides CPO with a unique product and something that's an easy sale -- which is clearly not the case here."
2,"Works with 64-bit Vista, but is exceptionally slow for USB 2.0","I'm a computer veteran of 29 years. This card works well with both my 32-bit Windows XP and 64-bit Windows OS. It uses the standard Windows drivers. However, I was seeing slow transfers, so I tested my drives using HD Tune 2.55 (free download - amazing utility!). Unfortunately, this is the slowest USB 2.0 interface I've ever used. My fastest USB Flash drives (the 8GB Kingston HyperX and 64GB Patriot Magnum), which normally give read speeds of around 33mbps, test out at 8mbps tops with this card. This is just barely out of USB 1.0 territory, and no where near the speed of any of the other interfaces I've used. You get what you pay for here I'm afraid!"
1,What can you expect for $15,"Installed this in a Dell Vostro, Core2 Duo 2.3ghz, 3gb RAM, Windows XP Home.The card was recognized with no problems but it works inconsistently.My iPhone and my iPod drop connection frequently.Neither my external Seagate 500gb drive nor my Sandisk card reader connects at USB 2.0 speed.A microsoft optical mouse will not work at all.The keyboard is fine, along with a cheap USB 802.11g adapter and a Canon MP470 printer.Overall, I have enough items that work and don't require 2.0 speed so I am ok, but I wouldn't purchase this item again."
1,6 of 6 cards had only 1 good port,"I purchased 6 of these in 2007; all were ~DOA.All ports recognized USB devices, but each card had exactly one port that would read an entire thumb drive without it disappearing. I tried several brands of flash drives; none would work on other ports for long."
4,Easy to install and works well in Vista,I installed this card and it was recognized immediately. It works well. My only comment is that it would be more practical if the ports were set vertically instead so as to fit one or two more USB ports.The CD that came with it is not needed in Vista and probably in XP either.Good product for the price and it arrived on time.
1,No sizing included in description - would've considered buying otherwise,"My mom loved the product description, but when we went to buy it -- no information was posted on the length of the product. It's unclear whether this is good for medium or large sized dogs. No details....no purchase."
1,Sorry no go,"It glows but not bright enough to be seen at night. To bad, it's a great idea if it was brighter. I just don't want my elderly parents to trip over their black dog."
5,"From Pong to CyberBurn, this is a must for the X-Gen Geek","Well, this book was like looking into a partial mirror of some of my friends lives, including mine. Growing up part computer geek - Timex Sinclair 1000 and C-64 were the basics - in a community of yuppie families with similar situations to Bennehum's put this book within a close striking distance to autobiographical for most of my adolescent friends and the entire genre of people that find themselves labelled Gen-Xers for that matter. Computers were a part of all of our lives from early on and Bennehum does a good job of using the digital metaphors to relay his societal message.If you grew up with an Atari 2600, Intellivision, whatever, and find yourself now working with computers on a daily basis, then you should read this book. God forbid you did all that and now find yourself immersed in cyberspace as a profession...but if you did this will read like an autobyteography."
2,"Interesting, but empty","It's an easy read, but I mostly found it interesting because there were many similarities to my own youth and computer education. The problem with this book is that there really isn't a message or a point. It's entertaining as narrative, but it's all empty calories."
4,Tennessee Titans Vince Young Jersey,The jersey was exactly as shown on Amazon.com. I bought it for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it!
4,Better Options Exist ...,"I just wanted to make the point that for $300-$350 you can get the SC-HT820/HT830/HT833 system, which despite the lower number is arguably better. The 820/830 system has AM/FM, fully controlled from the remote, 5-disc changer, and a mid-high end VCR with high-speed transport, and very good speakers and sound (does just great in our 15x30 living room.) This model sacrifices AM/FM/VCR for a little more stylishness, but imho its not a better system."
1,wrong photo,"the picture displayed in the product is not what comes in the box.photo shows the parts used on the rear wheels of the vehicle, but the next is for use in the front suspension.when photo fix, I can give the 5 stars it deserves the product."
1,Piece of Junk,"Total piece of junk. Do not buy this crappy base. Had problems with about every part. Some of the bolts do not fit standard wrenches. The iron already has rust spots, causing the paint to flake off. Casters do not turn easily.Do not buy."
1,Shop Fox Junk,The casters on this base are cheap junk. I have four of these bases under various Grizzly shop tools. The caster wheels failed after very little use. The outer layer of rubber peeled off the casters causing them to slide. DON'T BUY!!! THESE ARE JUNK! I have several Grizzly shop tools and they are good equipment but not the Shop Fox mobile bases!
1,Worthless,"The casters have been gritty since day one. Best of all, some genius designed the caster brackets too short, so that when the wheel swivels towards the frame, it binds, meaning the stand only works in one direction. Pay the extra $20 for the HTC."
2,Need a rough terrain version,"I think the biggest deviation in your floor you can tolerate with this is 3/8"" in 4 feet. Maybe 1/2"". It's a low rider to be sure.So if you've got a clean out sticking up some or a crack that rising on one side, or just plain lumpy, bumpy concrete, this one is probably a no go for you. I would advise you check your floors. You might be surprised how uneven that ""flat"" concrete in the garage really is.The feet, by the way, are pretty ingenious. Otherwise, it's strong, assembled easily, and is probably great if your floor is really flat.They get two stars as I think this is a really common problem that they can fix. Yo, Grizzly, fix it! Please. :-) Seriously, make a rough floor version. If my floor was flat, I'd want this one, low is good. But a whole lot -o- floors are not that flat."
2,Not well designed,"The side bars are about 3/16"" smaller than the corner pieces that they fit into so ALL the stress is bourn by the two bolts that hold the sides and corners together. The bolts are just held by threaded holes in the 3/32"" thick side bars so they strip out easily. At the full 29.5"" extension, the side bars are only held by two bolts, 3/4"" of an inch apart, screwed into a thin soft metal. The engineering term for this is ""scary"". The unit would be much better if the side bars fit tightly in the corner pieces and the bolts just served to keep the bars from sliding in and out. This base should only be used is situations where a sudden short drop of the load won't injure the user or cause the load to tip over. The base holds the load about 1 inch over the floor."
1,Waste of Money -- Buy Something Else or Make Your Own,"Junk for sale here. Bolts and screws were neither English nor Metric. Many bolts stripped in crudely machined threads, and I had to order replacements from Grizzly (which were different again in size from those received with the order). Parts fit poorly and are very poorly machined. Soft metal in threaded ""inserts"" (which support all the weight, and which are merely threaded holes through steel stock -- not inserts). This base is advertised to hold up to 1,200 lbs. My jointer/planer weighs 700 lbs and within moments after placing it on the base one of the mobile base wheels literally disintegrated under the weight of the planer -- it looks like they took small diameter wheels and encased them with a ring of a rubber-like compound. Avoid this poorly manufactured product."
1,Poor quality all around,"Unfortunately I spent an hour assebmling before realizing how poor quality it was. The caster mounts are all bent to different angles so it wobbles a good 1/2"" or more. I'm afraid to bend it as that will weaken it. The bolts are such poor quality the heads are not standard sizes and you have to go at it with several wrenches because you don't know what will work for each bolt. There was a good bit of rust on mine out of the box. ALso, one of the rotating casters hits a bolt so it will not turn all the way around. I'm trying to get this returned as fast as possible and will most likely make my own base. Sigh..."
5,strong and solid,It works great. Its so easy to move my table saw around. I found nothing wrong with this item.
1,Recapped casters,"I have owned this product for a while, but decided to weigh in on the quality. Perhaps this will keep someone from making the same mistake. The rubber rim on 3 out of the 4 casters broke off. That resulted in a wheel height insufficient to raise the legs off the floor. I corrected the problem by replacing all casters. Assembly was difficult as the mating holes were poorly aligned. The outrigger caster plates have sharp corners which can do a job on an ankle. Somewhat dangerous. A possible candidate for recall by our overly protective new consumer protection government. Just look for a better product and save your money on this one."
3,"OK base, wouldn't use for table saw","I am using this base for my DeWalt 18-900L drill press. I used two pieces of 3/4"" plywood to mount the drill press within the base. Initially I was very impressed with this mobile base. However, after I assembled the drill press to the base I discovered the flaw. Screwing the stationary feet down to take the weight off the front wheels, I found that the shaft of the standoff is too small within the barrel of the standoff chamber. This results in a slight rocking of the machine. This is not a big deal when it comes to a drill press, but I would not use this base for a table saw as it allows too much movement of the machine. With a drill press, most movement is downward pressure, unlike a table saw where pushing a piece of wood through the machine would cause the machine to move.OK for drill press. Look elsewhere for a table saw base."
1,Needs better casters,"This base sits under my 12-14"" Delta Tilting Arbor Table Saw, which weighs less than 500 pounds. It is a real chore to move the saw around my shop. I probably will buy better casters for it at some point. I wish I had returned it, but like the G7315 I bought and was unhappy with (see review), the base was assembled and the machine was already on the base. I'd already lost a few hours and was not thrilled with the thought of spending more time on it. I figured that I'd get used to it or improve it later. Buy an HTC or have a local welding shop make a base for you.These casters are the same as the ones they put on all of their bases. The metal is thin and the hardware is metric. The last time I checked, I still live in America. You need to have two wrenches or a wrench and a socket the correct size in order to install the casters. Adjustable wrenches won't work."
4,Best so far...,"I had put just standard wheels on my table saw but it wobbled. I saw this, bought it and my table saw is stable again. I highly recommend this for any woodworking enthusiast."
2,Disappointed with shipping and quality,"First, the shipping: UPS left a clearly damaged box on my doorstep. If I had been home, I would probably have refused it. Opened the box and found one corner bracket bent (I was able to straighten in a vise) and didn't find all of the nuts, bolts and washers as the bag had broken and scattered them.Second, the base: Although it flexes some, the rails and brackets seem to be ok. The casters are junk. They bind every time I move the jointer I put on the base. They will need to be replaced with quality casters or I will need to quit trying to move the jointer."
2,"Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy","The good: the saw goes 'round and 'round like any other saw. The Makita blade they send along cuts very smoothly.The bad: once you drop this delicate piece of 'construction' equipment you might as well cut the cord, remove the blade and give it to your 6yo for a play toy. The base bends--making it impossible to make a square cut or use the rip guide. The track guides one uses to set the depth bends & twists and makes raising/lowering the blade depth nearly impossible; the bevel angle gets knocked out of plumb (this is from a 30"" drop onto soft grass!)Let's face it, people drop saws! And one minor drop shouldn't render this saw useless (for all practical purposes); but it does...Also, it's not balanced very well and the mitre settings are difficult to read.Next time? I'm buying the (much cheaper but more 'manly') Hitachi. (forget Dewalt; they're crap, too)"
3,shakers,They are nice but if you need to refill them. The top is hard to get off. Not for people with authuritis.
2,Okay,It is not that interesting. I am surprised the reviews are as high as they are. I kept waiting for a good ending and only kinda came.
3,Slow but good,"This has some very good messages and lessons we all need to remember -- respecting others, not judging just on what we see, all people struggle and need care. I doubt this will be on my ""watch again"" list, but it is nice."
4,Pleasantly surprised,I was surprised to find this on Amazon Prime Instant Viewing. Was really a good little movie with great performances and interesting life stories. Worth a view.
4,Sentimental and Well-Seasoned,"""How About You"" is a small movie with a big heart. As it ought to be, considering it is about some struggling, out-of-the-way home peopled by some lost souls...and one additional lost soul that drops into their midst. Sometimes a better life can evolve if you get the chemistry right. It happened with this great cast, anyway. Their unpleasant characters slowly peeled away to reveal their understandable, if not likable, cores.Unfortunately, chemistry also supplied the movie's biggest flaw: an odd fondness for working the herb in too often and too flippantly.Even so, it is an excellent movie."
2,"Nice story, but too much profanity","Would have been a much better Christmas tale for me with out all the profanity. It took away from the wonderful message of love, unity and acceptance within ""How About You"". Would not recommend it to others."
2,Story doesn't live up to the stellar cast,"Great cast, but a rather tedious story. I wish I hadn't bothered renting it. An excellent cast can only do so much with a poorly-written script."
4,Great Feel Good Holiday Movie,"This isn't a fast paced film ... but it's not a snoozer either. It's a really nice, feel good movie for the over 40 crowd. Serious without being morose. Lighthearted and warm without being saccharine. I didn't want it to end. If you liked Marigold Hotel this is one you will probably enjoy. A charmer."
5,"Mercy, we need more",One cannot escape the brilliant beauty of Kathleen Peirce's poetry; not that any would ever wish to.
5,cry baby,this movie was one of the best films i have seen in a while with jhonny depp in.also he looks so hot in this movie compared to the oyher films.i could watch it 1000 times and never get sick of it.
2,SILLY,"I don't care what were the director's intentions. The result was a silly, poor film, that fortunately didn't harm Depp's career."
2,Lamest of them all,"Im a huge fan of John Waters, but I found this to be pretty lame stuff. This is the only John Waters movie I have only seen once....once was enough. It's not the WORST movie ever, as some reviewers in here have stated (c'mon, just about anything Madonna touches is worse than this)...the musical numbers are fun, but I'd rather watch Serial Mom or Polyester than Cry-Baby."
1,Really bad,"This movie was SO AWFUL. What a waste of money. I love Johnny Depp... but this is SOOO bad. It is overplayed, to the point where it's just dumb. It was really boring as well, with no plot. Really REALLY bad acting, and overplayed."
1,Absolutely terrible! The worst movie I ever have ever seen!,Anybody who likes his movie pollution junk ought to have their head examined. It's too campy to even be enjoyable. This is my worst hated movie that I ever have seen!
1,Cry-baby,"This is the worst movie ever produced. This movie is a waste of time to make. Johnny Depp is a fair actor and this is not one of his best. The rest of the cast is a bunch of low rate actors and shouldn't be allowed to be on the small screen, let alone the big screen. I wouldn't waste my money to buy this movie to burn it."
5,great!,This movie is great. Johny deepe <i hope i spelled his name right> is one of the best actors sround. This move is a mix between dirty dancing and grease!!
5,"Finally, Cry Baby on DVD!","I love this movie so much and I own it on VHS. CB is a real funny movie, it has good actors in it, and the music is great, too!Finally the studios opened their eyes and realized that the public wants CRY BABY ON DVD! Now, not only there's going to be a DVD of CB, but it will also be the Director's Cut with 7 minutes extra, and I'm sure they won't be boring. The movie will be shown in 1.85:1 WIDESCREEN, which is awesome and we can now enjoy better this great film!"
5,John Waters rocks my socks!,"Crybaby is an essential John Waters film. It's a musical set in the fifties with Johnny Depp and Ricki Lake. It's by John Waters, so you know it's going to be funny. And it is. It's the height of camp and fun and just wonderful!Buy it!"
3,"Really bad movie, but my daughter loves it for some reason.","This is a really bad movie, but my daughter loves it for some reason.Johnny Depp is OK in the movie, I guess."
5,<3,I just adore johnny depp. BUY THIS MOVIE. It looked brand spankin new when coming into the mail. I was very satisfied.
4,What a find!,This is one of John Waters' early movies and what a gem it is! Look at the cast list creating some truly unforgettable characters. I've enjoyed sharing this movie with friends...you will too.
4,"Grease with ""Attitude""","As much fun now as it was the first time I saw it.The music is great, the kids are cool.How can you not love this movie."
4,Cry-Baby,"This movie is set in 1954. It is incredibly cheesy and lame. However, i loved it anyway. It is a great movie for any big Johnny Depp fans. he looks very hot! but when doesnt he? the acting isnt the best, but it's funny. over all it's great!"
5,Best Movie ever,This is the best movie that I have ever seen! I know the words to the whole movie. Johnny is the best in this movie. If you haven't seen it you need to watch it. I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do.
4,Johnny Depp!,I loved this movie for it oddity and horrible acting. The premise of the movie was a bad boy (Johnny Depp) who falls in love with uptown good girl. Of course the usual happens at the end but its the voyage that I find entertaining and enjoyable. I would recommend this for someone who likes those old late 80's and 90's movies that scream off beat cult classic entertainment!
4,A guilty pleasure,"With the help of John Waters---the King of Camp'---Johnny Depp put a nail in the coffin of his Teen-Beat days and delivered a heaping spoonful of Delinquent-HillBilly-Delight in this outrageously bad 50's style musical spoof/comedy.If you're the shameless sort who's not afraid of lowering your standards for an hour and change then, ""You got it *******...you got it RAW!""----J.Depp"
3,My wife's favorite movie,"Rented for my wife on our date night. This is one of her favorite movies and I would recommend anyone wanting to see Johnny Depp, watch this movie. This movie shows everyone how talented of an actor Johnny Depp is and even at a young age."
5,What a great movie!,"My boyfriend and I just finished watching this movie, and it's still as good as the first time I saw it. And as for Mr. ""I Don't Do Chick Flicks""? Well, he enjoyed it too. The final verdict? Two thumbs up. The music is well placed, and doesn't turn this film into a cheesy sing along. Very funny, and a good movie for all!"
3,It's no wonder why Rikki Lake got into talk shows.!,"Johnny Depp has played in better roles than that at which he played in ""Cry-Baby"".The whole plot was rather strange, but everything had a funny twist to it. To sum it up although I didn't care for the movie ""Cry-Baby"", I love some of the other movies that Johnny Depp plays in. For example; ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Whats eating Gilbert Grape"", as well as many others. Keep them coming out Johnny!"
1,BOMB!,This is an awful movie! Even Johnny Depp (and I'm a huge fan) could not save it. Depps' role is as bad as the picture and Traci Lords is wasted also. This is a must NOT see. The director has to be a total buffoon.
1,Cry Baby........,"I wouldn't recommend this film. I think I got bored. It was so long ago, but I believe I was bored."
1,Horrible,This movie is in my top 5 of worst movies ever. The words boring and dumb cannot even combine to describe how bad it is.
5,Classic Comedy,"This movie is one of the funniest and wittiest movies I have seen. Yes it is silly, maybe dumb in some parts, but every once in awhile you need a movie like this to remind us not to take life so seriously! Johnny Depp is beautiful and fabulous in this movie as well as the rest of the cast, including the gorgeous and talented Amy Locane. Its one of those movies you can watch again and again, learn the words and sing along!So if you haven't seen it yet, expect the unexpected like you would from any John Waters movie, but also be prepared to laugh and feel for the characters!"
5,Great movie!!!,"Anyone who doesn't like ""Cry Baby"" needs to learn to appreciate John Water's great comedy. The actors are fantastic, the music great. Every girl will want to be Allison, every guy Cry Baby. If you don't appreciate the good humored fun poked at 1950's American society, you'll never get this movie. One of my top 5..."
3,The French Kissing Movie,"I really liked this movie when I first watched it. I guess it's because that's when I started learning abut ""French Kissing"". Now that I have my own children, I'm monitoring what they're watching and this is not one of my favorite movies to watch.I still love Johnny Depp and wished I was Amy Locane. But, that's just me being a fan. I hope you like this one, but don't let the children watch it."
2,too long to ship,"The product was good, it was wrapped and new as promised, but it took a very long time for the person to ship this product."
5,"The Movie ""Cry baby"" on DVD","This was a hard product to find when I first started searching, but Amazon had it! My daughter wanted this movie (DVD)really bad so I had to get it for her. The movie arrived promptly. It was of excellent quality (and great price). My daughter and I enjoyed the movie very much! How can you go wrong with Johnny Depp? I was very impressed for this was my first purchase from Amazon.com. I won't hesitate to order from Amazon again."
1,Cry Baby (Director's Cut),This version was terrible. The whole scene where they have the sing off is cut out. When Cry Baby gets out of jail it goes straight to the chicken race instead of the sing off. I loved the original one but I HATE THIS ONE!!! They cut out a main scene. The whole point of the movie is the sing off and they cut it out!! I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED!!!
1,Beautiful but NOT THE DIRECTOR'S CUT!,"The Director's cut, which is on the DVD, is NOT INCLUDED ON THIS BEAUTIFULLY REMASTERED BLU RAY! Even the John Waters commentary is edited where he would normally say ""This is a scene we put back"" etc. Shame shame"
4,"If you have a desire for camp, this is the movie for you!","This movie is hilarious! As long as you watch it with the realization it is not a serious film, you will enjoy the viewing. Half the fun is picking out the actors in the over-the-top characters. This is a typical John Waters movie, if that tells you anything. Big spoof of the 50's and the movies that harken back to that era.Plot: A square of a girl falls for the leader of the drapes. Hijinks ensue and eventually girl gets guy and becomes a ""scrape.""Definitely get the DVD version because the equivalent of the VHS can be caught on late-night tv and offers no special features."
5,true southern grit of american women,"IT JUST DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS, NOT ONLY THEIR SONGS BUT THEIR WONDERFUL MUSIC. I'M SIXTY YEARS OLD AND THEIR SONGS JUST SET MY SOUL AFIRE. I SALUTE YOU, DIXIE CHICKS, G.M. SUMNER"
1,WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!,This bogus item contains only TWO SONGS!!!! I tried to contact Amazon to return it and never heard back. What a rip off. Shame on AMAZON and shame on this rip off provider.
1,Unhappy With Purchase,I will never order on Amazon again. I received a pirated CD with only 2 songs on it and a copy of the front cover of the CD and not the original packaging.
1,not ready to make nice,i didnt like this cd. it only had two songs on it.i feel i got taken for the price i had to pay.
1,Not ready to make nice with you either!,Great! Now we have country music lite with a bitter aftertaste. This is NOT a good song. It isn't even poignant (look it up DC fans) or clever. It is just angry. There are just so many better country music artists out there.
3,decent read but nothing special,"Will Eisner shares a handful of his observations and experiences during the Vietnam Conflict in this 80 page, graphic novella, ""Last Day in Vietnam.""While the stories all contain a poignant moment or two (mostly along the variety of 'war is hell') the narrative is somewhat constrained by Eisner's signature artistic style - a euphoric, cartoony aesthetic - that seems somewhat out of place in constrast to the bleak message of the stories. That being said, fans of Eisner's work along with those who appreciate War comics will find some enjoyment from this title."
3,doesn't fit hole,I like it but the screw/bolt whatever was too small for the hole in my mailbox to attach it so I had to modify it. The part that it sits on is oddly shaped so it does not fit it well either. I used double sided tape and it fits fine now.
3,Quezon review,"Bought this book on the strenght of the author, having been the 1st president of the Philippine Commonwealth. Expected a lot of details as to private thoughts and honest opinions. However, the book felt like the author was window dressing it and writing for posterity (don't they all?). Although it doesn't take away any of his greatness as a statesman and a Filipino leader."
1,A disapointment,I was surprised to hear such high reviews for this book. I expected an easier to follow book with a better ending-you are left guessing about how the mail characters end up. It took about 150 pages to really pick up and make sense. At least it is an easy reader- big lettering and small pages-
4,An exciting story based on the real events!,"I read this book to my 7 year-old who is hooked on anything to do with Titanic! I thought it would be over his head, but he loved it! He couldn't wait each night to find out what was going to happen to Barry. He got totally caught up in the story and really enjoyed-so did I! A great story!!"
5,Great Book!!,"I loved this book because it talked about people's lives on the Titanic. As the book gets going, it gets better. From the first page to the last is pure exciment."
5,A Thriller That Makes Learing Fun.,"I thought this book was a wonderful fantasy of two young lovers. I would recomend this book to anyone, especailly if they like romance. I read it before the movie, and I think that a lot of the things in the book were real because they showed up in the movie too. Like when the band was still sinking when the ship sank, and the current that went down with the ship. This book really interested me in the Titanic, and I wanted to learn more about it."
3,"Not enough on sinking, but good story","Although it was a good book, I was kind of disappointed at the fact it hardly said anything about the sinking. Almost every character except Captain Smith and a few others with brief cameos were made up, including the main charcter. I enjoyed ""Back to the Titanic!"" more than this since it at LEAST focused almost completely on the sinking and not on one character (it also had REAL Titanic passengers included) If you enjoy fiction stories, fine, but to me, this book was a huge disappointment"
1,I didn't like it.,"I don't recommend this book to anyone, because it is boring and has too many side distractions. We don't need to know about a room stewards life. ""It's a caul. I was born in it. A child born in a caul will have the gift and the curse of seeing what you cannot.""Also, the ship will finally sink half way trough the book. ""My gosh! Look at the iceberg... way behind us. Hurry ! Quick, it's drifting away."" This book is way too long."
3,sos titanic,"I think this book to be somewhat old-hat, but it did have some surprising high points in it.The story is about a homesick 15 year old boy leaving his home in Ireland to go and live with famly in Boston. As you probably know the boat has a little trouble."
4,Interesting book of the week,The book SOS titanic was mostly about the pasengers. Some of the people on the ship did not about what was going on around them. Before they hit the ice burg the lady thinks it looked prety. As soon as they hit the ice burg and new they were sinking. They all began to scatter all ofer the top deck. I liked this book because the author really explans what people are doing. Like when he hits the ice burg the captainis reallyworied about the passengersand what happens to them to them. also they are in a big hurry to get the life boats. they alsoanounced that ladys and children first. Another thing I like is there are different carricters than in the movie . So Icouldent have watched the movie.
5,It was sooooooo exciting!,"Eve Bunting did such a great job on the book! I've read lots of Titanic books and this one was one of the best.While you're reading, you feel like you're with Barry and Pegeen and it's like they're your best friends. The book kept me on the edge of my seat. It was sooooooo exciting! I'm writing a Titanic book with my best friend and I hope it turns out as well as S.O.S. Titanic! Now all I need is the sequal!"
4,A boy experiances the sinking of the Titanic,"This book is pretty good, it's not the best but it's not that bad. If your interested in history this is a good book for you."
2,"Oh, well...a valiant effort...","Unfortunately, this valiant effort is Wayyyy over-shadowed by the TITANIC hype thrust upon popular culture by James Cameron's film. This is a sweet and well told story from a young person's POV, with real-life characters and events blended with fiction. However, after all the info on the subject with which we've been inundated, this little book ends up seeming trivial at best. The author makes, ironically, the same mistake as Cameron...the best TITANIC stories are the ones who focus on the REAL LIFE characters and not their made-up counterparts."
1,A PLASTIC FLOWER IN A REAL FLOWER GARDEN,"Writing a fiction story about the Titanic is trivial.This is just a simple little story that tries to capitalize on one of the greatest events of the 20th.century.While an historical novel can create an image of what took place in the past,such is the case in ""Gone With The Wind"" portraying life during the Civil War.This novel does no such thing for the simple reason there is no reason for it.It is like someone making a plastic flower and placing it in a real garden;it's just not needed and becomes a triviality."
5,"Tears, laughs, and more!, in one great book.","This book was wonderful story aboyt the R.M.S. Titanic. I have probably read every book about the TITANIC, and this is the best one so far!"
5,Couldn't put it down!!!!,"This is one of the most amazing stories about Titanic that I have read. After seeing the movie I wanted to hear another like it. Now granted I don't think any story about Titanic could be as good as Cameron's version, but it is still awsome! It's fiction mixed with fact. When I was finished I just sat there and had to take it all in. I would recomend this book to any one who enjoys or even doesn't enjoy Titanic."
3,A Time Piece,"Frankly, this is a time piece. A lean whodunit in a hospital during WW II with a simple guess who(?). All serious and stiff going until the arrival of the jaunty inspector played by Alastair Sim, a welcoming sight to uplift the film. Only for the nostalgics but flawless black and white upgrade by Critirion with a great cover artwork."
3,Classic whodunnit with WWII backdrop,"I only have a very brief review for this one, as most of the details are in the mystery and the plot and most of those details are spoilers. This is a rich and whimsical British mystery, the type popular with fans of Agatha Christie, for instance. It's set during the German blitz of Great Britain during World War II, and Gilliat backdrops the rather personal mystery held within an insular community with the Pavlovian terror of the bombings and the issue of world affairs in the heart of many a character's motivations. Otherwise, the motive behind the movie is kind of a let down, but don't let that stop you from enjoying the fun behind ""whodunnit"". The movie really gets started when Alastair Sim arrives as the quirky, wry investigator. He's a scene-stealer in every way, surrounded as he his by the usual in characters with strong personalities too involved in their own ways to be more than just a little truthful.--PolarisDiB"
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A quintessentially British murder mystery, Green for Danger doesn't bring anything new to the table but it's a well made whodunnit for those who like their murders mysterious."
3,"Fine, but no classic","Despite the critics, this is a very ordinary, grade B mystery. The acting is mediocre, the plot is preposterous, and the budget was low. It's probably Alastaire Sim who has prompted many viewers to rate this film highly. He truly was a presence on the screen. But he's much more persuasive in Scrooge and his several comedies, especially The Green Man. An Inspector Calls is another Sim B mystery. Neither is worth your time and money. Better to buy Charlie Chan; at least those films contain some comedy."
4,The Best Book About FDR's Declining Health,This is the most reputable book about FDR's declining health in his third term and his health in general. The best FDR biographies also cover this issue well.Also readFDR's Splendid Deception: The Moving Story of Roosevelt's Massive Disability-And the Intense Efforts to Conceal It from the Public.
2,Needs improvement,"This product has worked quite well for me, but a key feature broke, making is almost obsolete. I had to staple hail screen (hardware cloth) to a wooden frame. This required placing the safety mechanism (at the tip) on the screen and firing a staple. When the tip was wide it was not difficult. However, the tip is PLASTIC and it wore through after about 20 hours of work. The metal is very narrow, and was difficult to place on the screen to fire a staple. Consider selecting a stapler that has an all metal safety tip. This part is available from the Stanley/Bostitch website for $0.15, but shipping is $7.00!!!"
5,The best narrow crown stapler I have ever bought,"I bought this stapler to install crown moulding at my home. It uses 1.5 inch long staple and it went way through both the moulding and the dry wall into the wood. It is accuate, and the precise position allows error finish. I also used it to nail small pieces of dry wall to the wood to repair hole on the ceiling which I made for recess light installation. I got the job done quick ,and it turned out to be a lot more useful than I thought. It's surprising how often you have to nail some thin material and need something that won't just go through the piece as a brad nail often does. This is a quality product and it is very handy. It is a winner you should not miss."
3,"Nice stapler, No longer USA made","Bought the newer version of this stapler, model # SX1838K, after reading the reviews on the SX150K. Still a good stapler, but like the reviewer who preferred USA made tools, so do I. Is now made in China. It's a shame these big companies do not care what the customers want. It was my fault for not checking where new model was made. I returned it. I only keep USA made tools."
2,"Not that great, Ridgid is superior!","I had this Bostitch SX150K stapler for a little over 2 months. I was not impressed with it at ALL! It jammed often, didn't countersink, felt ""sloppy"", and lacked power to set 1-1/2"" staples in hardwood. I ended up selling it on eBay and buying a Ridgid stapler instead. My impression of the Ridgid stapler are, it is superior! Every detail seems to have been carefully thought out with it, fit/finish is superb, no jambs (yet!), tons of power, just as light as the Bostich, and it has a lifetime parts/service warranty! I suggest you steer clear of the Bostitch SX150K, and look at the Ridgid instead. (Check on eBay, I got my for $59.99 + $9.99 S/H!)"
2,I bought a hatichie winthin two months of owning this Bostitch,"I bought this stapler to replace an old Atro stapler and was very disappointed with it. While it is better than my old stapler in some respects, the bostitch line has not kept up with the competition. First problem with it was the fact that even on it deepest setting it would only drive a staple about 1/32 below the wood and often only flush, I had to use a nail set to sink to thing. You also have no idea how many staples are left or what size they are. A better window would help and is easy to do. Plus a lot of miss fires happen. This tool caused a lot of blemishes on my work and had to be shelved, and used only for background work. I bought the Hitachi stapler, and it's a world of differences. Very smooth operation, good depth of drive, and a nice window to see the remaining staples. And that's using the Boxes of Bostitch staples I had bought for the Bostitch gun."
5,very satisfied,"I've purchased tis item last year and it works great, even with a small compressor. It'll sink the staples & you can adjust the depth. Also the staples are galvanized so you can use it outside. Frank Nielsen"
1,No stars for the Bostitch SX 150 K,"I bought the bostitch SX150-K [which is Bostich's replacement for the S32] about a month ago from Home Depot. Biggest piece of junk I ever owned.""Staple, mis-staple, and jam."" Is what Bostich should have named the 150-K and that was the 2nd of 2 I bought that day. The first would not even pull the plunger back after pulling the trigger.2 trips to Home depot 120 miles in a 1 ton Ford Van W/V10 17.00All day wasted because ""New is not nessilary beter"" 300.00Finding a good deal on Ebay. ""Priceless""I bought a used S32 on ebayfor 61.00 and I used it today It worked flawlessly. Oh yea I used the same box of bostitch 1"" staples in both guns + the S32Hope I can find the reciept.I absolutely can not recomend this line of stapler Magnesum"
4,Great value and functional but i have one issue with the product,This is a great deal on the product but the only thing is that the wireless microphone is not very good and is vulnerable to interference even when 5 feet away. If you use a wired microphone then its a great product with alot of power for a rechargeable battery which uses a standard PC power cord and makes perfect sense. No proprietary cords! All in all other stores sell cheaper and inferior products that have 20 percent of the power that this has at the same price.
2,Easy to setup - hard to use,"The product sets up very easily and is operational in no time. Challenge is the mic sensitivity. You have to speak directly into the mic no, practically touching the mic for it to pick up the sound."
3,Pyle PA system,"The unit works well when you can get the microphone to stay on - unfortunately the switch in the mic is very cheap and requires constant fiddling with - the sound and volume are excellent - I just wish they chose a better component for the mic - this is typical of ""made in china"""
4,PA system,"Is just what I needed, came on time, used it at my block party and wasn't disappointed at all."
2,Disappointed!,"I needed this for a family reunion to be heard over a gathering of 80+ people. In a nutshell:What I loved about it:The priceThe sizeThe portabilityHow it worked when testing it at homeBut, I quickly fell OUT of love because:When it was time to go LIVE and use it at the reunion, did not work at allI had even purchased the upgraded microphone - neither the mic that came with it or the upgrade workedMorale of the story - it would have been better to invest the additional dollars to get quality. I should have read the reviews on this more closely. Oh well.... it now serves as a conversation piece, as I now use it as a table for me to place my drinks in the rec room. Lesson learned!!!"
3,Great Potential,"OK...it may be that I did not get a good unit. This has great potential and does provide nice amplification---however, the wireless mic leaves a lot to be desired as you have to get just in the right position for it to work well. Additionally, the range is not nearly what was expected. With a wired mic things work much better."
5,"This is awesome!! We took it camping, love that it charges and has a great sound.","Could not be happier, well the battery could last longer but we were playing it loud most of the day."
1,Horrible Company Service,"Microphone worked only once so I sent it back to Pyle's service center. After several weeks, I called them back (good luck getting through)and they said it was repaired and had been shipped back to me. After a week, I didn't receive the mic so I called them again and they said they made a mistake but it was now on its way back. I received the mic in a few days but it had the exact same problem! After numerous attempted phone calls I asked to speak to the service manager. I was transferred to a recording asking me to leave a message, so I requested a return call. Nothing. In about a week, I emailed customer support, explained my problem and requested either a new mic or my money back on the purchase. Nothing. I'm in the process of disputing the purchase with my credit card company.Horrible Service! Too bad I can't give it zero stars."
2,Don't break your mic,"This system works just okay. Try to turn it up and you get bad feedback.My microphone stopped working shortly after I purchased this item. I contacted Pyle to see about a replacement and got nothing but runaround from them.They couldn't give me a price for repair or to purchase a new one, or where I could even buy a replacement.Very frustrating!"
1,Wireless microphone failed when it mattered.,"I'm sorry to say that this unit failed miserably at an outdoor wedding - the sole reason for the purchase. Granted, it's a very inexpensive unit but I had to at least share my experience for others thinking of purchasing this for an important event. Luckily I was able to improvise and used a wired microphone and the unit worked fine for that.The wireless mic worked fantastic when testing indoors prior to the event. At the event, the mic wouldn't even work if I was right next to the PA... it would cut out and mostly not work at all.As a portable PA unit with wired microphone/instruments, it does OK. But there's a reason quality wireless mic systems cost hundreds of dollars on their own and this deal was a little too good to be true. Perhaps it might work well in more contained indoor settings but no luck for me."
2,Poor Amplification,I was disappointed with the PA amplifier. The wireless mike amplification was poor. A plugin mike that I tried had poor amplification. The guitar amp plugin did not have enough volume for my electric guitar. I had to go through another 35 watt preamp/mixer to get enough amplification for the PYLE PWMA-230 amp.
3,"Broke immediately, and Pyle won't return phone calls","This worked well the first time or two, but then the on/off switch on the microphone stopped working. You had to hold the switch in place to make it work. The manufacturer said I should return the microphone for repair and I'd have it back in a week. It's now well over a month and the manufacturer won't return my phone calls. All I get is v-mail, leave message, get ignored. Except for the one time I was in the customer support queue for 30 minutes and gave up.And you have to be really close to the microphone (like 1/2 inch from your mouth) for the microphone to work. On the plus side, you can walk in front of the speaker and you don't get any feedback.I'm really hoping the manufacturer is watching the reviews on Amazon - please help me get a working microphone back!"
2,PYLE-PRO PWMA230-200W VHF WIRELSS BATTERY POWERED PA SYSTEM,"PYLE-PRO PWMA230 - 200W VHF Wireless Battery Powered PA SystemI would never buy wireless equipment on line again. The mic never works properly even with the most expensive batteries and the unit being fully recharged. Since the 30 day return policy is up, I have to invest in purchasing another system"
4,nice forhe price,"I bought this PA for an outdoor beach wedding, and I think it is going to work out well. It is plenty loud. The only thing that concerns me is that the 100-foot range of the included microphone is pretty strict (might have even been less). I am not going to take the chance with it. Instead, I bought a wireless receiver that came with a standard and a lapel mic and a much greater range (150 feet at least). Overall I am happy with this PA. It is well worth the thrifty price."
4,Pyle 230 200W Wireless PA System,"This unit is exactly what we needed in our private Community center for us Seniors. Easy to move around, good quality audio, and good range with the wireless microphone.Everyone loves it and the price is right."
3,A little disappointed,"I had bought one of these before and really liked it. Like other reviewers experienced on another site, the mic on this particular unit that I bought did not work well. I think there may have been a short. We used this with a big crowd of kids at a camp. The wheeling personal speaker/PA was a hit and provided for some comedic moments. Outdoors we found that the amplification was only audible in front of the speaker. Good enough sound quality."
2,Didn't Work For Me,"Like a few of the other reviews, this unit didn't work for my use. As soon as I turned it on, there was a constant hum through the speaker. Not real loud, but very audible. The range was about 30 feet and as soon as I was out of line-of-sight, it quit working. I also had to hold the mic about 1 inch away to get a decent sound. I ended up renting a professional system and the performance was like night and day."
2,Defective microphone,"I bought the Pyle Pro PWMA 230 in Sept. of 2011 to use for large group meetings. The quality of sound from this system is excellent, but it comes with a lousy mic. The mic has a bad switch. The 3rd time I tried to use it, the switch was stuck in the off position. No one could seem to move it. I tried to contact Pyle Pro to find out if there is a replacement mic for it, but to no avail. It seems that it's made by a company called Sound Around. I emailed them and received a phone # and the name of the person in the part dept. When I called the number, no one answered. I've left message after message to call me back and no one ever has. I'd be very leery of ever buying another product from Pyle Pro because of poor customer service and a defective mic. I don't want to have to buy another unit just to get a mic that works.elliek23@comcast.netPYLE-PRO PWMA230 - 200W VHF Wireless Battery Powered PA System"
1,Not quite the original.....,"As I teach fairy tales to middle school students, I thought this version of the Little Match Girl would be useful for the classroom. It is a far cry from the original story. This version has an animal sidekick, talking and dancing trees, and she comes back to life at the end. Then there are the New Jersey accents. My class really and truly thought it was terrible. The music is straight from Charlie Brown's Christmas, the match girl looks like Madeleine, the sidekick dog looks like Arthur the Aardvark. The message about helping the homeless was well taken, but a new story might have worked better than to butcher a classic."
1,What the heck?,"Whoever wrote that script must have been watching cartoons at the time. It had to have ripped off ten or more different TV shows and music from them. They danced like in Charlie Brown, three spirits visited like in A Christmas Carol, she is dressed like Little Red Riding Hood, and I don't think I need to go any further. It stinks, and that's the end of it. Total waste to time and money!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,I thought I was out there alone!,"Having been a medical social worker for the past 22 years, I have always been aware of how important it is to touch another human being, especially those who are frail in mind and spirit. I have often been discouraged by the seemingly lack of compassion by far too many caregivers. I have discovered, after many years, that it is not because they don't care; it's rather an issue of time and self-preservation. True as this may be, it does little to warm the sole of those in need. Linda Nappier's ""Tender Medicine"" has brought it all to the surface through her personal and professional reflections. She did it with enormous insight, compassion and humor. Reading her book overwhelmed my heart, brought a tears to my eyes and added a definate smile to my lips. Thank you Linda!"
2,disappointing reinforcement of the status quo,"This book starts out fairly strong. I had a lot of hope for it. Eventually all of the potential dribbles away as it falls prey to homophobia. The author reveals that his key point of focus is withholding ejaculation, and somehow attempts to justify this while also adhering to the beliefs of Wilhelm Reich. I don't buy it.This gets two stars because it did have some food for thought (mainly toward the beginning). But basically the author reveals that he thinks an imbalance of nature is what is causing men to be effeminate and / or gay. If I wanted that kind of lecture, I'd turn on Fox News."
4,"It's a page-turner, but...","Though this story was interesting and kept me turning pages, I found Bob, the protagonist, difficult to sympathize with. He deeply loves his wife, yet he gives no good reason for having been unfaithful to her. Segal seems to want the reader to believe that Bob is a good man who has only been unfaithful this one time (an interlude that lasted for a few days rather than a more excusable single crazy incident), but how is the reader supposed to reconcile his supposedly honest nature and passionate love for his wife with his actions? Perhaps this novel is supposed to draw sympathy and understanding for human weakness, but what it actually ends up doing is chipping away at the reader's faith in true love by saying that even the most in-love of couples would cheat if it were unlikely they would ever be caught."
4,I thought it was a very good read.,It was a very easy book to slip into and feel immediately empathetic with all of the characters involved. I read it in one sitting during a sleepless night and really enjoyed it.
1,The Worst Novel I Have Ever Read,"This is, without a doubt, the worst commercially published novel I have ever read. The characters are wooden, the writing is stilted. The action flails around, going nowhere for long stretches. Example of the bad writing: The narrator's voice in the novel (third person omniscient) tells us about one of the characters, that she was ""fourteen, going on twenty."" Now mind you, I don't mean that a character said that in dialogue. The NARRATION said that. Using hackneyed cliche's like that is what I call bad writing. I can't believe that this book is still in print and was actually made into a movie! Spare yourself!"
3,"Audio version, though dated, still useful","The audio version of this book is fairly easy to take. The two tapes (each with two sides) can comfortably be covered in a few drives back and forth to work. While I must admit that I was disappointed when, early in the first side, the speaker announced that the most recent update to the book was in the early seventies. So their references to an expensive Dow of 800 or so is almost amusing today. I found, however, that the material was quite useful sometimes because of that perspective. We are all too often reading someone's writing today about how smart they were yesterday. It is interesting sometimes to listen to what someone thought was smart yesterday and determine if that wisdom would have held up to the present day.Tom Kelly"
2,Stay away from the abridged book on tape -- it's badly dated,"The abridged book on tape version (ISBN 0-694-51801-8) mostly covers market conditions in the early 1970s. (It's apparently an abridgement done in 1986 of a book Graham wrote in the early 1970s before his death in 1976). Yes, there is some historic interest here, but not enough of Benjamin Graham's timeless advice on investing. I recommend finding another version of Graham's work, unless you're an economic historian researching the early 1970s.By the way, Graham's comments on the tape totally failed to foresee the big energy crisis and runaway inflation of the mid 1970s (as did 90%+ of investors then, including most other experts)."
3,JZfrom Detroit,"While Graham's text is obviously one of the most important guidebooks for investors written in this century, I have to agree with the reader from L.A. and say that it is quite a difficult read. Perhaps this is why so few people out of the masses have made a fortune in stocks. If we could all understand it, we'd all be rich."
1,No real value here,"I got this book because of a Lou Rukeyser panelist who recommended it for understanding the latest milieu in the stock market. I found this book densely written, boring and of no practical value. A one year subscription to Money magazine would be better spent if you are truly a novice and are interested in portfolio analysis.Graham gives little insight to the market, focusing on how building your portfolio with bonds and stocks for long-term (ie. buy and hold) growth. Does anyone still believe that garbage? If they do have they held thru last debacle in the market and made money?Perhaps Graham has great things to say, but alas, not here."
5,Great tutorial on a great technology,"This is a great tutorial on WebClasses, and sadly one of the few books to do the technology justice. WebClasses are the Visual Basic 6.0 way to code web pages, and they rule for debugging and general maintainability. Read this book and learn why you should toss Active Server Pages in the trash (can you tell I hate ASP?). The writing is very straightforward and appropriate for someone with very little web development experience (i.e. truly ""from Scratch). I lead a team of developers migrating a code base from ASP to VB 6.0 and Web Classes, and this book was very helpful for those with little web development (or even VB) experience. It briefly discusses scalability issues, but if you're looking to put up a high traffic site with the Microsoft toolset, you might be better off with Homer and Sussman's ""MTS/MSMQ with VB/ASP"" by Wrox."
3,Check it out,"This seems to me to be a great book, however I heed a warning to anyone thinking about buying this book: Make sure you have everything that this book requires (i.e. VB6, PWS or IIS, >1 gig disk space, SQL Server, and knowledge of HTML.) I had some of these but could not complete the project because I did not have all of them."
1,For Absolute Beginners Only...,"Don't be fooled by the catchy title. If you're doing any kind of enterprise level development, this book would certainly be a big waste of time. To be fair with the author, even he admits that you should be looking elsewhere for enterprise level material. This books goes in painful details like explaining what ADO is and how to setup debugging in VB etc. MTS gets one paragraph in the entire book. Session variables abound. IMHO, the Wrox Book, Professional VB6 Web Programming is far far superior. I am getting my money back on this one. Stay away."
3,Webclasses from Scratch- proceed with caution,"This book will get you up and running - that's for sure. It does get hard to follow after chp6, expecially for the novice. It's worth the money if you need to know Webclasses. Liberty does a good job of helping you with bugs on his website. However, if you are new to VB , PLEASE look elsewhere for info on database connectivity such as Distributed Apps for VB6 (Microsoft Press). The EmployeeNet is a great example application, but the using ADO to go through an ODBC DSN is hardly cutting edge...."
4,New upgrade,"I recently purchased this saw and am totally satisfied. ...This saw has PLENTY of power, a very accurate fence, and the table top is nice and flat. Some time and adjustments are required to get this tool set up perfectly, but once it is set up, it is set!The blade was not set at 90 degrees to the table out of the box, but 5 minutes is all it takes to adjust this. The extension wings have room to adjust them so they can be flat with the rest of the table-take your time. Everything is adjustable on this tablesaw, so take your time, make your measurements, and adjust it accordingly.The only thing keeping this from getting 5 stars is the miter gauge. It is kind of cheap to put [an inexpensive]gauge in with a saw of this caliber. I will soon be upgrading this, but this is the ONLY fault that I have found with the saw."
2,slightly weak compared to their other works,"For a band that wants to be Front 242, they do a pretty damn good job of it. Their first CD, ""No Help!"" was classic 80's 242 along the lines of ""No Comment"" or ""Official Version"". With this EP however, the songs are much more tame, as are some of those 242-esque keyboard sounds that made them sound so cool. This is still worth picking up for any fan of the original EBM pioneers. Be sure to rip the hidden track and reverse it for an unexpectedly cool acapella version of ""When the Sky is Under Your Feet""."
1,Deservers negative stars,"Too bad I can't give it negative stars. What a piece of junk! The designer of this unit should not have a job in electronics, or any job that takes brains. Go clerk at 7/11 please!It is so bad, not just in how lousy it works, but in it's design from the get-go. I will never buy any product from a company that designed this thing.Prying the levers that you need to in order to connect the speaker wires is nearly impossible - you could break your fingers doing it and if you use pliers, which you will have to, the unit breaks.I just replaced mine with a unit (Sima) that works far better, is far easier to set up, and costs 1/3 the price. I threw my SpeakCraft in the trash.Good ridance!"

4,Dishes don't fit dishwasher,"The dishes are beautiful, but I cannot fit the dinner plates in my dishwasher unless I lean them to one side. I manage to put them in my dishwasher, but it is somewhat inconvenient and I must be very careful. I would have chosen a different pattern had I realized that I would have this problem."
1,Sizes larger than advertised,"I wanted this set because the plates are advertised as a reasonable 10 inch size, but upon receiving them they are actually a much larger and unwieldy 11 inches. It's hard to give yourself healthy-sized portions of food when using such a large plate.The ""cereal bowls"" are advertised as 6"", but they are 7"". They look more like serving bowls to me - they must hold at least a quart. Almost big enough to feed a Newfoundland his breakfast in. If you look at any box of cereal a serving size is about 1 cup. This amount looks pitiful in such a large bowl. A study featured in the September 2007 issue of American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that when nutrition experts were given large bowls, they ate 31 percent more food without even being aware of it.I was looking specifically for smaller-sized dinnerware. I am very disappointed that the actual sizes are not accurately listed on Amazon's website."
1,Chips easily-no support from Mikasa!,"I bought 16 place settings of this pattern to replace a Noritake set that I had for 15 years. The pattern is beautiful but within weeks many of my plates (dinner and salad) and bowls chipped (in 15 years only 1 Noritake plate and bowl chipped). I called Mikasa directly and they refused to do anything. They said there is no warranty for this pattern. Needless to say, I will never purchase anything Mikasa again."
3,"Nice dishes, but broken","I received my dishes earlier than expected. I excitedly opened the box to find 5 of the dishes were completey smashed. I see by other reviews that this has happened before. Although Customer Service was very polite and I will be sent a replacement, it was very inconvenient and now will take longer to get them. I do plan on adding to this set, but will think twice about ordering it from here. Amazon, you might want to rethink your packaging. Just a suggestion."
5,Excellence in item quality and customer care.,For everyday dishes - top quality! For customer service from Amazon on two broken dishes - TOP Quality. Way to go Amazon. I know now why I do more than a little business with you guys & gals. Thanks again.
4,Lovely,"Almost perfect set... just a few pieces had very minor flaws, that could only be seen when light hit it just so. if you don't make a serious inspection of each piece, they all look perfect! Great price, timely delivery, would definitely recommend!"
2,"I love the pattern, but they didn't last as long as I wanted","I've been married for almost 13 years, and this is our second set of casual dinnerware. We have had these dishes for probably 7 or 8 years. I replaced them because the Crate and Barrel earthenware dishes that I had started getting these gray lines on the plates. Well, now these dishes are beginning to get the gray lines. The lines look like cracks. I know that some people are happy to see their dishes going south so they can get new ones, but I just want them to last, esp. a classic pattern like this. I'm not buying earthenware (the softest) or stoneware (second softest) anymore. If you want these dishes to last a few years, go for it. But if you are looking for casual dinnerware to last 20 years, find something else.I do love the pattern - white but with some detail. The dishes look delicate and elegant, which I love. These can go casual or dressy, and there are plenty of pieces to go with your place setting."
5,L. S. Johnson,"I really love my new china...and was amazed at how quickly I received my shipment..they were packed very well and though the outside cartons appeared to have been roughly handled..the china was so well padded that there was no damage at all... I have ordered many things from Amazon and I am extremely happy with their promptness.Sincerely, L.S.Johnson"
5,This Call For Repentance and Reformation Is Right On!,"This is all-star lineup of conservative Christians of differing confessions, but united in call to the church of today to repent of its adultery with our heathen culture, and to return to God's Word, to have our consciences tied to the Scriptures as Luther stood and would not recant, move or be moved.Series of essays delivered at conference, with a common theme: let God's Word change the culture rather than the culture changing the world.Horton, Veith and Wells are always thought=provoking writers, and their contributions here are a continuance of that."
1,Darkside review of Shagged me,"I rented this only to see Misty Mundae run around and get naked and do cute Misty Mundae things. I got a boring viciously awful, miserable acting. And cut up watered down sex scenes, (though I think I saw the R version, check the running time for the unrated if it shows more lesbo nipple sucking). WARNING NO NAKED MISTY HERE! Look elsewhere."
3,not bad,"needless to say the acting sux, but the story isnt that bad(its tolerable). but then again thats not why your interested, is it? misty only has 2 short scenes. the first one dosent have enough of her but its stil pretty hot. the second scene...it could have been worse. just more faux lesbian. overall if youre interested in misty i guess you could make a worse choice. i give it a 3.5 for not enough misty even though shes on the cover."
2,where's the movie?,"I was eager to experience the Misty Mundae cinema, but was shocked when this movie that barely made sense just ended. There was a promise of Part 2, but there wasn't enough running time to make this a whole film. And there just wasn't enough of Misty in the film. This is not a good place to start if you want to expore Misty's talent."
1,Just Plain Terrible,A waste of time and money. Couldn't wait for it to be over. Don't expectanything exciting to happen because it does not.
1,Very dissapointed,"I bought this book because I was interested in Pique Assiette and the only other review said it was very good. Now after buying it I see that every single project has exactly the same instructions! Basically you are reading the same text over and over again and all thats changing is the photos. Take my word, save your money and buy something else."
1,For the beginning crafter,The book covers the very basics. The projects are targeted to the weekend crafter versus the artist. Most of the pieces are quite chunky and have little quality technique with lots of grout holding the pieces together. Could be good for young people's first projects -- definitely not recommended for serious projects.
1,Poor Quality gauges,lots of problems with these gauges from leaking to shorting out the temp probe. buy better gauges stay away from these
4,"lynn has done a wonderfull job,information is power.","I have read lynns book thru many times,and have been able to use it to free not only myselve,but also many friends and patriots. hard hitting and to the point,with freedom forms and expose on I R S. A must read for anyone who wants to educate theirselve`s ."
1,Meredith Convicted,"Just a word to the wise. Lynne Meredith was convicted of Failure to file income taxes, and other charges in Federal District Court in Los Angeles in May 2004.This book was part of the trial evidence that convicted her."
1,I know someone that went to jail for 2 years....,My friend's father read this book and got it into his head he didnt have to pay income taxes. He is currently in jail for 2 years. Caveat emptor.
2,"Valiant cause, but lacking solid ground to stand on.","Though Lynne Meredith means well, and is correct that there is no law forcing you to pay taxes, she suggests using many faulty arguments that can lead you to prison. It is important that you read the much more reasearched, professional and cautious book by Otto Skinner before you take any action with just Lynne's book alone."
2,"Valiant cause, but lacking solid ground to stand on.","Though Lynne Meredith means well, and is correct that there is no law forcing you to pay taxes, she suggests using many faulty arguments that can lead you to prison. It is important that you research her arguments carefully before taking any actions. The truth to tax freedom is much simpler than her book makes it sound."
1,Time to bring out the tragedy mask,"Curly Howard on the cover...I've just told you the funniest moment of this DVD. These are the color shorts that most Stooge fans wish would just go away. They are not funny, but rather sad. Kinda like Willie Mays playing the outfield in skates in 1973."
5,response to the previous person review ?,"In response to what Chloe had said. I am not T. Heitzman the author, but his father Tom Heitzman. I support my child and believe in what he's doing and thought it quite ignorant of you to put down someones work unless you yourself have read it. Not only ignorant in the sense of rude, etc. . . but ignorant which is used and defined as lacking knowledge of a subject matter."
1,Wow.,"Hahahaha! ""T. Heitzman""? You toolbag! You can't review your own work. If you're reviewing your own book are you really being that sincere? Is sincerity really an art form? Come on now, Buddy..."
1,they have a degree for this nonsense???,"I needed a class for the summer, I'm an engineer. This has got to be the dumbest course of study ever. Dont get a degree in this nonsense for pete's sake, you're wasting your parents money!"
2,Very broad coverage if IS/IT,"I found this book covering a very broad range of topics in IS and IT subjects. A good book for a beginer (suggestion: rename to ""IS Management For Dummies""). A terrible book for experienced users searching for specifics. I found the discussion of IS management practices painfully boring and over simplified with too many definitions. It needs to cut to the chase. There are far better selections in this price range."
2,Reviewer,"We used this book for an MBA course meant to help the average manager make IT decisions. Although parts of the book were interesting, the professor and nearly all of the students in the class did not like the book. Several chapters can be eliminated without missing anything. Organization is poor. Information is redundant. Perhaps if this were an online text it would allow for more real time updating of content to make it more interesting. No color images are used but yet it is still very expensive. Figures are not interesting. This text could be improved for use in an MBA introductory course by cutting out 25-50% of the material and making it much more readable to the non IT expert."
3,College book,"I had to buy the book for one of my class (information resource management) but as an MIS major I though we would get a little more into the 'management' part, and I was disappointed with the book as it doesn't go much indepth of the matter.It's a good theory book, let's say!!"
2,"dense, hard to read",This text seems to ramble without ever providing much in the way of concrete information. It is dense and wordy and makes it difficult to get the point of what you're reading.
1,Poor,"This book is poorly written. I am sure the writers did their best to write this; however, it is a bunch of information thrown together unorganized. The graphs didn't make sense sometimes. There were definitions towards the end of chapters that should have been in the very beginning to help read the rest of the chapter.I was skeptical about the negative reviews, but they are right. I can't believe this book is as much as it is. The book is also old (2009). Although a lot of business concepts stay the same, technology changes quick.I don't know how any instructor can use this book in a PhD or a Bachelors setting.Don't buy, (or read), unless you have to."
2,Incredibly boring,"Although it has some good points, overall it is lacking structure and a theme for every chapter."
4,Review by Grad Student,This was my textbook for a graduate class in Information Systems and I enjoyed the book very much. The first chapter is a great introduction to show where the world of IT is and how we got there. Also the case studies are worth the price alone since they take real world corporations and offer insight into the improvements/mistakes they have made. Up to date also b/c it covers modern topics such as SOA and ESB.
1,Poor text,"The content of the book can be interesting, but only if you can get past the many, many errors throughout this book. Here's a sample sentence, and there's more where this came from: ""In simple terms, efficiency refers to ""doing the thing right"" (for example, minimizing the operations costs buy using low-performance processors), and effectiveness to ""doing the thing right"" (for example, setting an application system to support the mission of the organization). Indeed, being efficient does not necessarily lead to being effective.""Interpretation? That's a direct quote ..."
2,Not very helpful...,This text is too broad and not very helpful. The author's writing style resembles a college level paper on this subject. Too many definitions and not enough explaining.
1,A SIMPLE TREATMENT OF A COMPLEX SUBJECT,"This text is little more than definitions, dated interviews with IS/IT execs and simple guidelines. If looking for relevant IT/IS information - pass!"
1,This book is way over-priced,Very general information for the hefty price. Reading a few inexpensive computer magazines on this topic would be more helpful than this expensive book.
4,"a great book, but way over-priced","I used this book for a graduate course during the summer semester. Overall, I enjoyed the broad-based approach adopted by the authors. The numerous case studies were extremely useful also, as they adequately illustrated what the authors were trying to say.My only beef with the book is its price. I don't think it's fair to charge so much for the book. But for the cut-throat price, this book deserves five stars."
3,I expected more...,"I expected a bit more out of this book than I got out of it. It seems to touch on a little bit of each aspect of using concrete for floors, walls, countertops, etc. But really doesn't go into too much depth, which leaves it up to the reader to do lots of their own experimenting. I would like to have seen the book about twice as thick, with a section more devoted to all the different colour variations and textures that the author has come up with.People tend to buy books like these so they don't have to spend a bunch of money on trial and error testing. And I think this book could have been a whole lot better in that department.There is some really nice concrete work in this book that will get the imagination fired up. And there is also some pretty corny concrete work, that may turn some people off. Lots of photo's of some of the kitchens the author has done. Not exactly Johnny Grey work, but quite nice.Even though I only gave it 3 stars, I would still recommend it."
3,good pictures but short on how-to,The pictures were great and the book needs more of them. The technical side of how to create the looks needs much more material and better presented.
4,Concrete at Home book,"We used this book along with Cheng's other book and DVD when making our own concrete countertops. It was very helpful to us because we did a ""pour in place"" countertop where you build the molds right on your existing cabinets and pour the wet concrete in the molds for a seamless finish. Cheng's method for countertops focuses mainly on building molds in your backyard or garage, pouring the concrete, and then flipping the finished pieces over so you start with a smooth finish. This book has a lot of good examples of poured in place projects, so it was helpful to use this in conjunction with Cheng's countertop book."
5,It's a pity....,"That people expect to have the years of knowledge and experience Mr Cheng possesses handed to them on a platter in this book. Any true craftsman wouldn't ask for that, and any novice shouldn't expect it (and particularly not for $22!). This book is a wonderful overview of the amazing qualities and possible applications of concrete. It's designed to get your mind working, and the creative juices flowing. Not as a ""Concrete for Dummies"" (and how flattering are those books to the average intelligence anyway?). Buy this book for inspiration, for some tips and tricks, and prepare yourself to be amazed. If you want further insight into the methodology, buy the first book as well. And despite another reviewers claims, most of Cheng's work is NOT poured on site, but in the shop, and the pictures on the website are gorgeous! Professional jealousy perhaps, but even as 'just' a coffee table piece, this book is really beautiful."
2,Concrete at Home: Innovavtive Forms and Finishes...,"Fu-Tung Cheng's latest book is no more than a glorified coffee table book, seeking to either inaccurately convince buyers that it is a 'how to' guide, or to establish a racket on the sale of concrete related products and courses. For those who have read his first book, perhaps a little trial and error will allow you to apply the proper technique and acheive the desired results. If you haven't applied the techniques from his original title and you don't want coffee table decor, avoid this one. If you have applied the techniques from that title, you might be better served my thumbing through the latest book at a local bookstore. Shame on you Fu-Tung Cheng."
4,GAVE ME IDEAS,This book has given me an insight into what is available out there in the concrete world. Good book for the beginner trying to make concrete into an art piece.
2,Assembly Problems,"My sander arrived on time with all the parts a specified.My problem came when I tried to assemble the unit as per instruction book. The lock nut was so tight on the spindle it was impossible to remove without destroying the rather flimsy tools provided for the is purpose.I am not a weak person and slightly bent the spindle wrench when trying to release the lock nut.The lock nut was finally released by anchoring the lock nut with 12 inch channel locks and beating with a hammer on a stout wrench around the spindle.Apart from this, the tool works as advertised, but if I had persisted as per the instruction book the tool would be idle awaiting replacement wrenches which would probably have met with the same fate as the first set.Norm PowellLas Cruces, NM."
2,More of the same old suburban angst,"I've read this book several times before: Unhappy suburban wives act out their angst. That the wives themselves are caricatures in their pursuit of personal perfection isn't new territory, either.What surprised and disappointed me the most was that it seems as if Strohmeyer, whose earlier books made me laugh out loud as the unique aspiring journalist Bubbles solves crime after crime, has had the humor drained from her voice. Nor is she the keen observer of others' foibles we have come to expect and enjoy.There is sarcasm and some wit, but precious little of the good-natured, aint-life-a-laugh spirit of the Bubbles series. Get this at the library if you must, but save your money for more Bubbles."
3,a wee bit too much RACISM,"i enjoyed your Fourtunate Wives book, but i really found all the rasist remarks very offensive. Why does she feel the need to portray Black people as if they are the scum of society?"
5,Outstanding Read,"Those ""rich"" Hunting Hills housewives keep busy keeping those youthful looks high spending lifestyles.There are 10 Rules to live by in Hunting Hills and every one is devised by the rich wives to keep their rich husbands and the more money they spend,is the more it expected of them by their successful husbands.It is known and expected to rendevous with each others men as long as it is kept within the confines of Hunting Hills.Marti Denton decided too late to put her efforts into the most eligible, most handsome bachelor of Hunting Hills(John Harding) as he went outside Hunting Hills and to Prague of all places to marry (Claire Stark) someone who does not look or fit in with what is acceptable in Hunting Hills but who in the end is their best ally and friend.A good book that you don't want to put down until you find out what is going to happen next."
3,A Guilty Pleasure!,"I picked up this title because I was looking for something light and fun to read, this certainly met all of my expectations and then some! As the book started out, I was worried as to whether there would be any substance, the characters were seemingly flat and shallow, but I suppose that is appropriate given the nature of the book. I would liken this book to watching any episode of ""Real Housewives"" on TV. It was enjoyable, even it at times I found some of it to lack credibility. I think if there had been fewer characters, Strohmeyer could have gotten a better handle on them and created more depth and realism. The end buttoned up way to cleanly to actually be believable, but that is part of the entertainment value. Overall, not bad, quite entertaining and a recommended beach read. I am looking forward to reading other titles by this author."
2,Thoroughly Unimpressed...,"This book was so disappointing after the other two books I have read by Strohmeyer. I have her newest book, but after this disaster, I am reluctant to pick it up. The characters were not developed and so shallow. Even Claire, the main character, was poorly drawn. I felt no connection to her, and her situation was not compelling. Her husband was just as shallow, and the other characters were downright ludicrous. I understand the basic premise, but with such stereotypical characters, I was not into the book. Plus, the writing style was really obnoxious. This was a disappointing departure from The Cinderella Pact and The Sleeping Beauty Proposal. When I do get around to reading Sweet Love, I hope it is better than this..."
4,Enjoyable read,"These wives are not just your run of the mill, brainless, trophy wives. They see their position and lives realistically - that they can be replaced at any time and that husbands will probably cheat because they are successful enough to get away with it. I liked this book because even though the characters were shallow, materialistic and just downright conniving, they were also survivors and smart and most of all, realistic.It is silly during some parts but all in all, pretty enjoyable befored bed read."
4,BOX set,Though the dvd boxes are not the same as the rest of the moie boxes it is the same ol DragonballZ that we love. A great set that saves you money with al lthe same enjoyment packed in.
2,Poor Quality and Terrible Service,"My complaint is not just about the chairs quality, is also about the Vendor, I bought 2 chairs and one of them arrived with many damages, discolored, chromed frame is cracked and chromed cover is falling apart all over my house, is terrible. The quality of the chairs is poor and it seems the product has not been stored correctly to keep away from damages."
3,good video...,wasn't what I had expected but gotta love life.... and louise hay always makes my day.. good cd just the same...
2,Beware type of walker you have,"This DOES NOT fit all type walker. Apparently, it fits only standard walkers which the description did not make clear. My mother has a walker with a fold down seat, but the clasp that grasp the walker frame are position so that the upper clasp is where the walker frame curves to the top which prevents the clasp from properly attaching.Additionally, it takes some coordinated effort to fold up or down the tray which th elderly may have trouble with."
4,A walker this tray will fit is:,"Duro-Med 2-Button Adjustable Aluminum Folding Walker with 5 Inch WheelsI'm posting pics of the tray installed.One thing to note: some of those clamps are stiff, and require some muscle to press into place. Could be a problem for some seniors with weak hand strength."
1,did not fit,When we recieved the tray the clamps where to small to fit on to the walker. The clamps where plastic and you where afraid that if you forced them they would break... Manufacturer needs to look at the design....
3,Duro-Med Walker Tray,"Duro-Med Walker Tray. This tray made the walker clumsy and heavier to use. It is, however well made. and should last."
1,Poor design,"The unit itself arrived fine. The design is the problem. The tray pitches downward and feels very weak. i would not trust this for more than a can of soda. This thin gauge plastic will start to have stress fractures with little weight over a period of time. The ""locking"" design is a poor jam fit and not any form of lock or even a deep grove. The grips that clip to the walker were the only part that was desiged correctely."
1,Doesn't work,"I purchased two of these trays for my two (home and car) walkers. They wouldn't stay attached to either walker and while trying to use them I had numerous spills. And forget being able to fold a walker with the tray attached. Doesn't work, the tray comes loose immediately and has to be re-positioned. Not easy for my arthritic hands."
2,walker tray,The tray is sturdy but lacks ease of use. The locking hinges are difficult for older people to use. They don't know if it's locked properly.
4,A fine unit that isn't quite what it's advertised to be,"See my later review, Amazon replaced the original unit as it was defective."
5,Fein Turbo III for CNC Vacuum Hold Down,"Read a lot about these vacuums being used as vacuum hold down on CNC routers, and it exceeded my expectations. Very powerful vacuum & quiet!! Works great as a shop vacuum and dust collector as well."
1,Flawed design breaks bag holder.,"I ordered two of them (in sequence), and returned both. Both were broken in exactly the same place (The bag holder has a flange that hooks over the orange part of the vac. The black motor housing clamps down on this flange with a couple of latches. The flange was broken under the latches, which is clearly clamping too hard.) It's unfortunate that the unit has this obvious design flaw, but I'll buy a vac with less plastic."
4,excellent vacuum,"I bought the fein vacuum for dust collection for my 744Dewalt tablesaw, makita chopsaw and my Dewalt 12 1/2 planer. It does exactly what I need it to and more, It's very quite compared to my ridgid vacuum and powerful, works wonderfully. No complaints so far...Recommend highly."
3,Plenty of suction but missing features,"I was surprised to read the complaints by others of inadequate suction, as that's the area where this thing really shines for me. That and the amazingly quiet operation. While standing on a ladder drilling holes in a concrete ceiling I discovered that I could place the hose against the ceiling and the suction was strong enough to hold the hose in place for several seconds. The ceiling was 11ft 6"" high, so it was holding quite a bit of hose weight.With the paper dust bag in place it's quite a clean operator.It does have some failings:The automatic on feature has never worked on the unit I bought. I found the hose does not fit directly on the exhaust port of a Makita battery operated compound miter saw (I use duct tape to hold it on). It lacks an onboard tool holder - hard to excuse at this price."
3,"Good, but could be lots better","Quiet machine w/ good suction. For the price, should have been furnished w/ basic tools and a place to store them. Instructions are non-existant. There is a hose bracket that I cannot figure out how to use and a rubber wedge(?) furnished which is a mystery to me. The vac has a ""hook"" on the top, which would seem to have some use -- don't know what! This is supposed to be a high-end machine, but the instructions are typical of low-end Chinese tools. The hose is very stiff and in close quarters can be annoying. Where is that great German design talent?"
5,Entertaining and Gentle,"This has been a good purchase for our family. The teacher is very engaging with the students and tries to be slightly humorous. Each lesson has 3 parts -- grammar, sentences, reading -- and the dvd has stop spots to do the worksheets in these breaks. The worksheets are downloadable pdfs from the official website for the dvd. I am not sure that this would be a good choice if you do not plan to download the worksheets as there does not appear to be enough repetition to grasp the concepts without the pdf work. We were put off by the Prima and Latina dvds but these are really well done. Also, I would preview the dvds if you are looking for a secular curriculum - these might not work for your family."
2,"Decent functionality, Durability is pathetic","The features on this gun are good: it's light, has good power, and an easy depth adjustment. It has no bump fire mode, but thats not a big problem for a brad nailer. But this gun has a very major flaw for anyone that uses it a lot: the driver rod is very low quality, so after a little while the tip of the driver will get ground off or bent or chipped or something. This in turn leads to ever increasing jamming, because the driver isn't hitting the brad exactly square. Unjamming this gun is a major pain, you have to get a 3mm allen wrench and take the whole front apart. And then, sooner or later, the driver will just snap. you can replace it, but its not really worth it, becasue you will end up with the same series of promblems. the Hitachi brad nailer has more features and better reliability, and senco is senco, it will last forever and a day. Buy those instead."
2,On my second and no better....,"Compared to other Bostich nailers this one is terrible. I'm on my second nailer in a couple years. The first one worked very well but developed air leak somewhere around the trigger. I didn't have the time to mail it to Bostich to fix so I bought a second one.The second nailer is terrible. It jams and won't fire their own (Stanley) 1 5/8"" nails - there are grooves in the magazine where the heads of the brads sit and there is no groove in the nailer I have for those brads. A minor issue but that's what I had on hand for brads.I don't recommend this tool."
5,pneumatic brad nailer,It was much cheaper on Amazon. It works very well and has performed what I have used it for. I have used it for building projects andthe ability to use 1 and 2 inchnalis is superior. I have used Bostitch products in the past and this one has continued to keep my faith in that company's products. Excellent value for the price
2,Inconsistent results. Not as good as PC BN200A,"I tried the Porter Cable BN200A and the Bostitch BT200K. The PC worked flawlessly, felt more solid, and just generally outperformed the Bostitch. This surprised me since I own other Bostitch nailers and am quite satisfied with them. The Bostitch would not throw the nails consistently slowing down my work flow considerably. Additionally the PC seems to be able to tolerate different types of nails more easily. All in all the PC is just simply better. Spend slightly more and save yourself time and trouble => Buy the Porter Cable."
2,Not pleased,"I recently bought the bt-200 expecting great results. I had seen a lot of publicity in trade magazines and was excited to see how well the gun worked. The first problem I ran into was trying to load 1 9/16"" 18 ga. porter cable brads. The clip jambed and wouldn't close. So the gun doesn't accept any brad up to 2"". Then I loaded the 2"" brads that came with the gun. Once I hooked up the air, I noticed that the trigger leaked air. Then I began fireing the gun at different air preasures within its working range. I had a miss fire of one out of every five shots. I bought the gun with a litte scepticism because I had problems simular to these with bostich staplers. I returned the gun and got the porter cable. No problems."
2,SB-1850BN vs BT200K,"I borrowed a SB-1850BN (shoots same size brads but must be oiled) from a friend and was pleased. I decided to purchase a brad nailer. I saw the BT200K ... it did not need oiling, and proclaimed to be maintenance free ... great. I fired maybe 40 one inch brads at 80 psi. The depth would not remain fixed, I had two misfires and I was having two hit marks left on the wood. I took it back ... the store tested it ... no double hit marks ... but it did misfire and the depth would not remain fixed ... I received a refund. Yes ... I now own a SB-1850BN ... I don't mind having to add a drop of oil."
2,dissapointed,I wish I didn't have so many misfires because I like the gun. I took it in to a certified warranty place to get it repaired and it still misfired after that so I went to the top! Bostitch (Canada) and sent it there to be repaired (still under warranty). In the meantime I bought a Ridgid oilless brad nailer - NICE GUN!!! The Bostitch guy replaced the whole body on my gun and then my first day using it I broke the narrow orange cast part at the rear of the gun. They were nice enough to send me a new body for free but I'll be doing the repair myself and selling the gun cheap when I've repaired it because I love my Ridgid gun and I'm tired of the Bostitch downtime and shooting so many holes in my work. I also don't beleive in having to use Bostitch nails only in a Bostitch gun. Ridgid didn't specify any nail because they don't make them.
2,"Not that great, Ridgid is superior!","I had this Bostitch BT200K Brad nailer for a little over 2 months. I was not impressed with it at ALL! It jammed often, didn't countersink, felt ""sloppy"", and lacked power to set 2"" brads in hardwood. I ended up selling it on eBay and buying a Ridgid brad nailer instead. My impression of the Ridgid nailer are, it is superior! Every detail seems to have been carefully thought out with it, fit/finish is superb, no jambs (yet!), tons of power, just as light as the Bostich, and it has a lifetime parts/service warranty! I suggest you steer clear of the Bostitch BT200K, and look at the Ridgid instead. (Check on eBay, I got my for $49.99 + $9.99 S/H!)"
1,"Misfires, double/triple nails: what a disappointment!","Bought this gun specifically to shoot 2"" nails on a wainscote project. What a mistake! I tried using some 2"" nails I found at the local Harbor Freight, and when I saw the terrible results I ordered some 2"" Bostitch nails from Amazon. Paid extra to have them ""life-flighted"" in the next day. Even when using the 2"" Bostitch nails, I get double and triple nails, sometimes standing 3/8"" - 1"" proud of the work. What a mess I had trying to patch and fill all these holes for painting. I started using nail guns because of my repetitive injuries to my wrists: pulling all these nails has seriously aggravated my tendons, not to mention my blood pressure.Bostitch, you just lost a customer with this junky product!"
2,piston made of plastic,The piston of this nailer is made of very low-grade plastic and does not allow the hammer to draw back easily. Nailing with this tool was a problem from day one.
1,poor quality control - buy a Senco,"I purchased this tool based on rave reviews that I'd seen. I immediately had problems driving 5/8"" brad - about 50% would misfire. I shot a couple of hundred into fir just to see if I could find out a workable technique. No luck.I returned the tool and got another which had even worse problems - the trigger leaked air and the drive plunger wouldn't retract. It would drive 5/8"" brads OK but anything longer than 1"" wouldn't go because the plunger wouldn't retract.I finally gave up and purchased a Senco FP25XP for a lot more money cause I didn't want to chance buying another dud from Bostitch. They need to fix their quality control problem."
5,Strong Product,"I recently purchased a BT200K and have been very pleased. the oil-less feature is nice....just go to work. No problem with jams thus far, but I use only top-quality brand name brads (not necessarily Bostich). Drives brads clean and fast, countersinks nicely with adjustable depth of drive. Nice plastic carry case and a 1000 pack of 2"" brads included. I've been happy with mine....."
1,You would think a brand new tool would at least work once.,"I bought this nailer even after reading the negative reviews. I was arrogant enough to think ""ah these people don't know what they are doing"" Well I apologize for my arrogance. I got the gun home, actually read the instructions ""Yes I am a striaght male"" then set my compressor, loaded the gun with the brads that came with the gun. I shot one into my base board. Then pulled the trigger again. The gun shot but the nail didn't come out. I reloaded the gun, same thing happened. I read the troubleshooting guide, and after taking the gun apart, adjusting about 14 things, and reoiling it I could shoot about 5 nails before this happened. As you read this it is sitting back on a Lowe's shelf waiting for some other sucker to by it. I bought the Paslode for the same price. Great gun. No problems."
4,A fine brad nailer,"I borrowed my friend's brand-new BT200 to do some trim work in a room addition and have had absolutely no problems with it while driving 2"" brads.Now I'm in the middle of a huge project building shelving for our home-based business and have driven just over 3000 1"" brads without a single jam or misfeed. I do find that Porter-Cable brand brads seem to be a little harder and drive better than Bostitch brand - I'm nailing into some hardboard which is really a challenge for weak nails.Overall, I haven't had any problems with this brad nailer and am considering buying one for myself."
1,Unacceptable Performance,"I'm am on my second one in less than a month, both have had the same problems, driver hangs up, and the gun fires but does not shoot nails consistantly. I had the first one sent to a service center, before returning it, which fixed the driver problem but not the rest of it. Would not recommend. This gun is a far cry from the quality that I have found in the past with other Bostitch Nailers."
3,"It's not at all bad, but there are better choices out there.","I like the Takacs Quartet a lot in the middle quartets, but they are just too heavy and slow-footed in Op. 18 for my taste. Certainly this is the case compared to the wonderful set by the Quatour Turner, which may be the best ever in this music. But I also prefer older sets by the Budapest and Vegh quartets too. Listen to them back to back, and appreciate the difference."
2,Great cheap table,"Flimsy but attractive; what I needed for my small outside area. $119 is too much though, $75 would be right. Two and a half stars."
4,intriguing psychological drama,This is a great story told in a series of flashbacks. A fantastic foreign film where we meet many intriguing characters who would make Kramer from Seinfeld look tame.
4,Supercool Lounge,"A very smooth confection, beginning with Les Crane's kitsch yet cool monologue ""Nature (Wilderness)"" and getting progressively deeper and chilled, climaxing with Herbie Mann's sumptuous 10-minute version of ""Come Together"". One of the best 60s/70s 'easy' compilations I've heard, with just the right sprinkling of soul to prevent it becoming monotonous. Recommended."
4,"CHEAP, EASY, AFFORDABLE","When I bought this surround sound systemn for my computer it was my first. I spent a long time searching and these speakers read better than any other in this price range. I went for it, and I made the right choice. All the cables are extremly long so you don't have to worry about the speakers reaching. I have trouble with my center and rear speakers at first, but I quickly worked out these minor flaws. Now i love these speaker. The subwoofer will rock your world. It shakes, it rubles, and boy can you make it LOUD!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,How do I adjust the HEADPHONE VOLUME???,"I have had these speakers for months. I use the headphone jack alot. It is very conveniently placed, but the level is very very low and I have NO IDEA how to adjust it. I am very sad and would love to find out that I am overlooking something simple. If you know, please e-mail me with the adjustment."
2,Boring,"We didn't enjoy Two eggs, Please. It was a little slow and not enough of a story to interest my 4 year old. Obviously needs a younger audience."
5,Why did I wait so long?,"I have been woodworking since I bought my Powermatic Artisan 63A table saw in 1988. I have always wanted a Unisaw but just couldn't justify the price since making sawdust was just a hobby. I decided to bite the bullet and ordered the left-tilt Unisaw with the 50"" Biesemeyer fence. My hobby just took a quantum leap forward! ...I had it in my driveway in 4 days. It (and all the other boxes) arrived in perfect condition and went together exactly as the manual described. The rails for the Biesemeyer aligned perfectly with the saw cabinet. I put on a Forrest WWII blade and began my first project, a desk for my granddaughter. It's too bad there are only 5 stars because I would certainly rate it higher! I am totally satisfied with the saw, shipping, shipper, etc. Everyone and everything totally met all my expectations! Now, there isn't a tree in Utah that is safe!"
3,Ever get the feeling. . .,". . . that the producers of a given series just ran out of episodes? That's the impression I get here. Like the writers woke up one morning and realized ""Oh no, I only have one episode left! And I still have X, Y and Z plot threads to tie up!"". So, they mushed everything they had left into a single blow-out episode. The dramatic potential of the revelations is muted, and at least one of them didn't even make sense. Here's hoping Tenchi Muyo GXP fills in some of the gaps.As for the extras material, the live-action special is informative, but those women are annoying! If you don't enjoy 40 minutes of people pretending they don't have brains or vocal ranges, I recommend frequent use of the mute button. The radio skits are fun, though; I could have happily sat through more of them."
3,They're ok.,"These aren't any thicker than cardstock. The designs are kind of corny too, but I guess you get what you pay for. For an adult the bookmarks would work ok if you're careful. I would not buy for a child of any age."
5,Super cute and kitschy wizard and dragon bookmarks,"Like most of the reviewers, I bought these bookmarks to qualify for free shipping. For $1.50 I got 12 super kitschy bookmarks. 12! That's a pretty sweet deal if you ask me. Sure, they are perforated but a paper cutter or a ruler and scissors will fix that issue pretty quick.The bookmarks are printed on card stock and will hold up better than the usual receipt or sticky note that I typically use. I plan to purchase more for stocking gifts."
1,Bookmarks ;|,They are bookmarks ;) I needed something to make it to the $25.00 SuperSavers Shipping Limit. They are nicely printed on card stock but nothing special but if you are at the $24.95 point and don't want to pay for shipping they are great.
3,"Nice, but could be better","My main complaint is that the cards come in little booklets and you need to tear them out. They use perforation to do this. The product would be better if the cards were laser cut so they would separate easier and provide a clean, smooth edge."
5,Bookmarks,These are packaged as a small book where you unperforate the bookmarks. They are actually quite pretty with interesting pictures.
1,History in Full,"A single correction in response to the representation of the book on this site: the excerpt from page 56 alludes to the absence of German and Italian internment camps during WW II. This is the enduring public impression, but not actual fact. People of European origin were interned. See, for example the historic record of Crystal City, Texas for a better understanding of that time period.Note: my response is to the excerpt, and not to the rest of the book, which I have not read, thus the above 1 star rating is posted only so I can gain release from this Review section..."
1,Lynne Meredith was convicted,"Bonita Lynne Meredith, a/k/a Lynne Meredith, Lynne Meridith, Lynn Meridith and Lynn Meredith, was sentenced in June 2005 to ten years and one month in prison for conspiracy, four counts of mail fraud, two counts of using a false social security number, making a false statement in a passport application, and five counts of failing to file a tax return. She wrote two books, ""How to Cook a Vulture"" and ""Vultures in Eagle's Clothing"". On June 26, 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed her conviction in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.Meredith is imprisoned at the Victorville Federal Correctional Center (Victorville Medium II) near Adelanto, California, and is scheduled for release in February of the year 2013."
4,Excellent introductory text on Proteins,"This is a great introductory text on protein science. It starts off with the basic chemistry of amino acids and polypeptides and goes from there into higher order structural organization of many proteins of many families. Reading this book allows one to think about protein function being a direct result of what the structure imposes. Although this is not a protein chemistry book, it's a great place to start appreciating how proteins do what they do following some elegant design principles.The book gives interesting structural examples on how transcription factors use their DNA binding sites to recognize specific genomic sequences. Also, the story of how the voltage gated potassium channel can be orders of magnitude more selective for potassium over sodium is presented clearly. Overall, this book is necessary for any biologist doing protein related work, or anyone who wishes to gain more insight into how these tiny ""machines of life"" operate."
4,A Good Introduction to Protein Structure,"This is a good protein structure book with a lot of intuitive cartoons on that. The major deficiency of the book is that it is slightly outdated because structural biology continuous making progress in recent years. There are very little in depth analysis based on the physical chemistry of protein, so it doesn't provide more insight into how protein functions. I give it 4 star because the pictures are really gorgerous."
3,Japanese animation mystery TV series,"The ""Case Closed"" ( one truth prevails) TV series is better than some of the American TV series in terms of the plots.The mysteries are well figured out.The older detective constantly hitting the kidis just not what Americans think is very good?This punishment theme shows a Japanese kind of outlook on children."
3,Mystery anime,"When Shinichi Kudo, high school super-sleuth, is given a potion that changes him into a six-year-old, he takes the name Conan Edogawa and goes to live with his former girlfriend and her detective father, who are both unaware of his true identity. With Conan at his side to steer him in the right direction, the detective becomes famous across the country for being able to solve difficult cases. These short episodes are sometimes clever, but the murder schemes are often as ridiculous as the premise of the series."
3,UNIQUE BUT VAGUE ENDING.,"Overall I enjoyed this book, but the ending is where I had problems, very vague and it just fizzled out. Maybe I just didn't get what the author was trying to say, and I could see two possible ways the story could end. Not distinct enough. I did like Sean MacDonald and Pamela and I could feel their pain and frustration over the ghost. Donald Beman has a strong writing style and I would definitely read more of his books. Not a perfect book, but still enjoyable."
1,Not even good for fire wood,"I find myself reading this book and wondering how old the toldler who wrote it was. The book seems like the author was full of himself and very uneducated. The book drags along one uninteresting page at a time from front to back. I do have to say though, the book does end with a bang, that being the sound your brain makes as it stuggles to figure out the horriblely written ending to this un-masterfull piece. As the title states, I tried to burn the book in my fire place and the book seemed to last hours in its firey death. Even trying to get rid of the book was boring. Worst book ever as comic book guy from the simpsons would say. One star is not a low enough of a rating for this work of trash....."
1,Didn't like,"I am a fan of horror, suspense, but this book just didn't do anything for me. It was poorly written, very hard to follow. The concept was interesting, but this novel goes no where."
5,Loved it and I'm a massage therapist,I loved this book. I'm a massage therapist and I read this while in my third trimester. I started massaging my baby the day he was born while in the hospital. The techniques and information are easy to learn and my baby loves his massages. I definately recommend this.
3,Why buy a book? A video is so much nicer.,"I'm turned off by these dummies books. Is there ANYthing they don't have a book on. ANd I'm not a dummy. It's so much nicer to look at a DVD, especially when there's not only baby massage info, but information from a QUALIFIED therapist on baby development and natural exercises and interaction to do with your baby to make sure he is developing well. I recommend Aimee Ketchum's DVD (very inexpensive for the top quality and plethora of information in it) and WEE Exercises (also very well done)."
1,Not suitable for woodturners,"I bought this grinder to use to sharpen my woodturning tools. The left-hand platform that comes with the grinder has a slanted v-groove in it which gets in the way of balancing a tool against the wheel in any other position. It is not interchangeable with the flat, right-handed platform. Also, the base of the grinder, unlike other grinder designs, sticks out under the wheels. This makes it incompatable with grinding jigs. I want to use a jig, and I now have to buy another grinder. I do not recommend this grinder for woodturners."
5,Author! Author!,"Historical fiction at its best...Winegardner's ability to deliver historical fact in the context of a compelling love story, while at the same time exploring the midwest attitudes about race, gender, social class, family, politics and sport in the middle of the last century, seems impossible. But he does so with grace, wit, charm, and amazing depth. Winegardner's tip-of-the-hat to such giants as DiLillo are classy and smart. There's something in this book for everyone."
3,a decent read,"This book by Mark Winegardner told me more about Cleveland than I knew, and more than I really was interested in knowing. He weas able to develop a few interesting characters and go with them over time. I did learn some interesting things about Cleveland, but it was a little difficult read for me. Some others I am sure will find a lot of good reading in this book because there is a lot of information packed in the story.J. Robert Ewbank, author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,Terrific Read,"This is a love story written about a city. Cleveland has been much maligned for many years, but Mark Winegardner has written a story to make Clevelanders proud. For those readers with no interest in the city or its history, this is a rollicking good story full of larger than life characters inter-twined with historical figures. Mark Winegardner's writing style pulls you in and the story is so compelling that I didn't want it to end."
3,Ouch!!,"As mentioned before, the author tries a little too hard to be brilliant, cutting-edge, trendy, a ""risk taker,"" etc., by using footnotes, parentheses,etc. No one wants to read footnotes in a novel, especially when some of them take up almost half of the page of already fine print text. Half of this novel could be cut out. So much of it was dull filler! What was the point of that chapter on Dorothy Fuldheim? That was brutal. Could have been better. What a great title though!"
2,Not Good,"I trudged through this book while asking myself why I was reading it. It is fragmented with branches that seem to be taking you somewhere but don't. I finished it and regretted the effort. Not a good read. Not worthwhile. It is like a compilation of cotton-candy stories that each read well, but leave you wanting something mentally nutritional by the time you get to the next chapter. And honestly, I don't care about Cleveland!"
3,I Wanted to Love This Book,"Having read all of Jack Driscoll's books, I bought this one hoping to completely immerse myself in the work of a favored author who hadn't published in awhile. After the first fifty pages, it was hard to keep going. Luckily, the poet in Mr. Driscoll breaks through often, so there are stretches of beautiful prose which could almost stand alone as poetry. In between, though, are the drawn out ruminations of a protagonist who was hard to get into and stick with. While son Rodney is boyishly lovable and zany girlfriend Rhea intriguing, Archie Angel is almost emotionless--at least in the parts of the story where it counts most. Instead, Driscoll uses symbols from nature (such as a dying swan) to ""speak"" for the main character."
4,Only one problem,"The only problem I've found with this stroller (we've had it 2 years now) is that the buckle that goes across the chest is too high and not adjustable in the right direction. The strap goes right underneath my daughter's neck (she's 2 and not small), not over the chest. Other than that, the stroller holds up really well and is very easy to control. If it had a swivelling front wheel, it would be nice... but for this price, it's great!"
4,Sibelius distilled,"These remarkable and lovely symphonies do not follow the conventional development one might find in Nielsen or Sibelius, Dvorak or Brahms. They are more a stream of consiouness that evolves and flows, more subtle, less obviously dramatic, less colorfully orchestrated particularly less use of the woodwinds, a more subdued use of brass, more a feeling of being propelled forward toward an inevitable conclusion. More like Bruckner in tone but without Bruckner's somewhat contrived effort to make an epic statement while maintaining it's own seriousness and gravity. These works are like musical essays. Very attractive and appealing."
2,No Music,"If you can't read music (i.e. the bars, lines, and notes just get in your way), this is the book for you. There is no written music, no time to set the tempo, nothing. Just words with the chords written above. If you don't know the song, there is not a melody line to learn it. As long as you are familiar with the song, you can wing it and get by."
4,Grrrreat!,I got a chance to listen to this album and i must say I was shocked to hear this little pleasant suprise.I did'nt hear it all but I was immidiately reminded of a great little Greek band called Samael.It sounds alot more like their older stuff-hope that helps.Keyboard reigns here(over some medium paced distorted guitar)with some evil ass black metal style vokills.
2,My fish do not like the change,I have purchsed these sticks in the past but Tetra changed the formula and now my Cichlids will not eat them.Old formula were colored thes are all brown. I wish I would have known before and could have saved my money
5,Took the dread out,I'd always wanted to write my family's history but couldn't get started....didn't know how. This took me step-by-step and showed me how to make it interesting. A terrific guide.
1,VERY Small Chair,I ordered this chair for my just turned two-year-old grandson. My daughter returned it because the chair is way too small for a child that age.
1,defective TV from Targer,The TV was advertised as new. An obviously used TV with a defective screen arrive. After a lot of hassle I was finally given a return address label. But the refund still hasn't arrived after nearly a month. The problem is mostly Target. Do not buy from Target via Amazon.
2,how can u compare this measly thing to everquest,"no way in the league of everquest.lords is most of the time rpg,and here it fails.the graphics and video were just not upto the mark and the storyline is very haphazard.ditched it one day."
1,Buy Warcraft 3 instead folks,"Lords of Everquest is obviously an attempt for Sony to get revenge on Blizzard since Blizzard is taking their Warcraft world into the Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game Genre(a genre that Everquest put on the map). Only problem is...Blizzard knows how to translate Warcraft(Real Time Strategy Game)into an MMORPG...unlike Sony who obviously does NOT know how to translate Everquest into an RTS game.I laughed at my friend when he showed me he bought this game for his PC. He was like ""Shut up, how was I supposed to know this game was garbage!!"" LOL! Funny stuff.I suggest you only buy this game if you can get it for under 20 dollars otherwise invest your money into WarCraft."
1,This game is horrible,"i cant believe i wasted 30 dollars on this trash. i thought this would be better than warcraft3. WRONG!if you want a good RTS game get Warcraft3 and/or Warcraft3 Frozen Throne. Just dont pick up this trash because if you do, you will be sadly disappointed that you lost 30 bucks."
5,Learning about Sex Series,"This is a great Christian based (Bible based) way to discuss sex and everything that precludes it with your children. It coaches you through everything from the time they are little and even gives you sample conversations. That part is great for any tongue tied parent nervous about these types of conversations. But, once you start the ball rolling with the book, it encourages your children to come to you with their questions instead of their peers. This book set is great!! Especially with the parent guide."
2,Better than the stork story???,I was very disappointed by this book. I gave it two stars because it has cute pictures. But when the word God shows up at least twice on each page I have a problem. Am I supposed to feel good that I don't need to explain anymore since God did everything? I am not against religion but I am also an educated person and I believe that telling my kid that he was created by God is just as far from the truth as telling him he was brought by the stork!!!!!
3,Pollini not at his best,"I am a great fan of Pollini's work. Many have found him too cold and rigid, but I've always loved the glittering clarity and elegance and concentration of his performances (and, yes, often their warmth and beauty of tone!)However, this latest recording is not one of his strongest. Technically, it's superb, of course, but there's a grimness and occasional harshness to the performances which are disappointing. There are, as usual, flashes of brilliant and exciting playing and well-judged tempi and phrasing, but the whole recital just has a gray, unpleasant quality to it.Pollini's early recordings for DG were almost uniformly wonderful. These days it's more hit and miss. Some recent things have been terrific (some of the Debussy and Schumann, for example), but this CD is not one of them."
2,"It blows, but not enough.","I own this 92MM fan. While it is inaudible, and it has reduced the temperature inside my computer case about 5 degrees Celsius vs. no fan at all, it doesn't have enough power to do an adequate job. Had I been smarter, I would have never have purchased it, because there was no specification listed about air movement. At the store where I purchased it, there were plenty of 80MM and 120MM models, but there were only three different 92mm fans, and this was the best of the three. I have since ordered a ThermalTake 92MM fan from Amazon to replace this one. It is much more powerful, but it is audible. That's a compromise I am willing to make, since my computer's environment is not as cool as it should be, especially during the summer."
2,"Reasonably good text, very poor student/instructor guides.","The text itself is brief, but still a good overview of discrete mathematics. The main problem is the student and instructor guides. The answers frequently have errors and problems are not reiterated in the text, so a student or a grader has to flip back and forth between at least two books to make sense of the solutions. Even more frustrating for students is the fact that some problems do not have good answers: the author admits that he cannot solve the problem and refers to answers from other problems instead. This is simply not fair to students who may be struggling with the material.As a teaching assistant, it is not up to me to select the text books. If it were, I would look for a replacement."
1,No beauty here,"On the surface this seems like a great book - all of the topics in a Discrete Mathematics course are covered, the information is cleanly laid out, and the quality of the binding is excellent. At closer observation, though, this book has some serious flaws that should keep it from being considered from any universitie's curriculum.Discrete math should be the class that introduces students to the beauty that can be found in math through proofs. Proofs are the foundation of mathematics and - especailly in an introductory text - should be comprehensive. This book leaves out important steps in a good deal of the proofs, making the proofs themselves hard to read. This should be an easy, clear class for anyone intrested in math. If you are struggling, you owe it to yourself to find a real text on proofs to see what mathematical beauty really is.My advise is - if you have to use this text - buy a good book on proofs and another good book on number theory. There are plenty on Amazon."
2,Definitely not a good textbook,"Attention, students! Don't be fooled by those words like ""best book in the field"", ""unrivaled content.""This book contains lots of examples but NONE of them is interesting. Really. The explanations are too vague. Mr Rosen must be thinking that an ""obvious"" example needs no further explanation.I've read a few math books and found a lot of fascinating applications but the applications in this book are just too theoretical rather than practical.The stuff about Logic (the very beginning section) is more confusing than really useful, especially the section about how to translate between English sentences and mathematical statements.I believe there are much better books out there. Before you buy this book, think carefully."
1,Hard to understand,"I had to use this book as a student for my discrete mathematics course. I hated it. I found this book hard to understand and follow. The ideas weren't clearly explained. There were lots of problems at the end of the section that were barely or not at all explained in the chapter. There were only a limited number of examples in each chapter, and most of the examples finished with ""the proof to this is left as an exercise to the reader."" If this is a book designed to teach discrete mathematics, I would assume the reader wants something that wouldn't leave every example as an ""exercise"" to the reader. I want a book that gives examples, lots of them, and finishes each one. This book could use a lot more of that."
1,book is good enough for me to fail my class,"<pre>if you know your instructor is going to use this book in his course, stay away from this class. If you are really good at math, and had some programming experiences before, go ahead buy this text and spend mega hours in your life. If you really have to buy the text, try to bug your instructor and TA all the time to ensure a passing grade. My instructor actually declared that he won't teach again with this text."
1,Worst Math book I have ever read....,"So far I have taken Calc 1,2,3; Linear Algebra and Statistics and this book is by far is the worst textbook that I have ever read in mathematics. My professor has a separate packet that she uses in conjunction with this textbook. Her packet is way more useful that this piece of ****. I like math and I like computer science but this book cant get the job done at explaining anything. I strongly urge you to look somewhere else regardless of what math level you are at."
2,Not the best I have seen,"This book is not the best. It's hard to follow, the proofs are especially confusing and long. I would not recomend using it."
5,Great,I like using the activities in this book for a homework twist. It's not just your usual worksheet.
4,Good intro to shoji,"I've read the book 3 times already, and refer back to it frequently. It gives a good introduction to shoji, but I find that it is meant to be a refresher for an actual class. Some sections are vague, such as calculating board feet, so I had to go to woodworking websites for that exact procedure.The book was good enough to make me acquire two Japanese pull saws and a marking guage. I'm in the process of getting a finishing plane, so maybe I will then see how I do on actually constructing a shoji screen using the book's tips! Tool vendors seem to know the author, so he does know his stuff."
3,For students of traditional Japanese craftsmanship,"The book was purchased to buiild shoji screen in a more modern american shop. i wnted details on the joinery, sliders and paper. It is more of an overview of construction highlighting the traditional methods of screen construction and variations. Sharpening tools was interesting but I think I would use a power planer instead of a hand plane. It was a Japanese version of the ""Woodwrights Shop"". Certainly not for beginners"
3,Buyer be warned.,"Awesome in theory. Be prepared because you won't own any of the tools to get the job done. But... if you want to live like Mr. Miagi and try it out, I guess its a good book."
1,Not the original publication of this work by Kirkland,The original work was published in 1985 by the author and Nancie Austin (illustrator). Kirkland passed away in 1992 and this edition was NOT authorized by Kirkland as it was published after her death.In my opinion Elithe H. Kirkland would NOT have approved of this edition. The first edition is now a collectors item and very limited in number.
5,Really great product.,"Like the other reviewer I have been amazed at what this device will do. It has a camera (that is only weak link), plays mp3, and records like a tiny vcr. You can have a couple hours of your favorite shows on this at any time. It shows me how a really great device might not become popular as you rarely see this advertised or run into anyone who has one. It is not a cheaply made device and I have been using for years."
5,Ironing Music across the Coral Sea,"I was ironing while peering out my window across the Coral Sea, thinking about the intervening years between 1989 and 2009. How much is a long time? How many radio evangelists does it take to change a light bulb? Does this iron need more water? And I was suitably transported by the timelessness of this music, how it is as relevant as it ever was and then I made a sandwich."
2,Whatever,Took a risk buying this in CD format. I like David Byrne. He's very creative. I have always doubted my Eno threshold though. If you like his thing then you'll love this work but for me he's stuck somewhere back in the new wave sound of the eighties and can't shake it off. Sorry Brian.Take a gander through the mp3 samples herein to decide - I should have.
4,A Ground Breaker From Adventurous Artists,"Brian Eno and David Byrne are two of the most adventurous musicians out there. Off the heels of the masterful ""Remain In Light"", the Talking Heads biggest names came up with an album that would blaze trails for generations. Released in 1981, the tracks have an amazing sound to them. This was an era where the artists didn't have access to high-tech digital equipment (tape loops sound much funkier anyways) forcing Eno and Byrne into unexplored territory. Although the voices on tracks (which contains a fair share of religious vocals) may have overstayed there welcome to some listeners, the rhythms still kicks some serious butt. The reissue still doesn't include ""Quran"", due to pressure from some religious backers who weren't delighted to find out that worships were being utilized on grooves. Therefore, the reissue isn't a necessity if you already have a copy."
5,"""Do you hear voices?""","Brian Eno + David Byrne / My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts(18 audio tracks + a video on a single CD):Odd music and strange voicesVideos added to audio CDs have always been a pain, don't buy this for the videoI really like this crazy album, I've had the original for over 30 years now. You may love it. You may hate it. I wouldn't argue with you either way. Definitely a matter of taste.Five Stars"
4,"...from ArtsyFartsy News, January2009","This month's artist is Brian Eno. His work and music is everywhere. From film and television scores, quiet spa background music or just plain, good, wacky stuff, his collaboration with Talking Heads' David Bryne, Brian Eno's playful music is in my studio this month.Fair warning - all of Eno's work is not for the faint of heart. It is however, an audible adventure: Early recordings of religious tent revivals, remixed over new world music is a hoot. It grew on me the more I played it. I even practice my drumming to this CD! If it's a Brian Eno CD, you get your money's worth."
4,Wonderful Case,"Takes good care of the phone & it's accessories. The ability to change clips is a very nice feature as well. I bought 2, as the i730 over-size battery stretches the leather out to the point where it's not quite tight on the phone anymore. So, 1 for the large battery, 1 for the small battery."
3,"well made, good fit, BUT..................","This is a very well made case for the i730 by Samsung, it's unfortunate however, that it will not accomodate the larger, thicker battery pack. (which I think is the battery used most for this phone due to its powerful PDA and screen features). In fact, at the time of purchase, I don't think any other company was making a custom case for this unit. So once the regular sized battery pack dies, and you install the larger, while the other re-charges, the i730 must be left naked, unprotected. The Only alternative would be to buy a generic case that merely carries the unit. And the unit must be taken out of the case to use each time. I'm surprised that Krusell didn't take this larger battery pack into consideration in its design process."
3,Worked well while it lasted...,"We bought this camera (actually the European version C-40 Zoom) after doing lots of research, and loved it. It was easy to use, had awesome picture quality, and even made short mpeg movies. However, when it was about 10 months old, we had a problem where it wiped one of our smartmedia cards, so we lost a few photos. We sent it away for checking, as it was still under warranty, but they found nothing wrong, and we didn't have the problem again.However, when the camera was 15 months old, it failed completely. It was no longer covered by warranty. We spent a LOT of money on this camera, believing you get what you pay for (and I guess it was great while it worked), and were very unhappy that this occurred. At the time of writing this review, we have yet to send it away to see how much repair would cost, but have been told by Olympus that we'd probably be better off buying a new camera. If that's the case, it won't be an Olympus!"
4,A Very Good Camera,"I've had my Olympus Camedia D-40 for almost a year and I'm very happy with it. I bought it for the combination of small size, sharp lens, and plenty of manual controls. It's also an advantage that the camera uses only two AA batteries. I have four NiMH rechargeable batteries so I always have a spare set. The battery life is good if you don't use the LCD screen all the time. I use the optical viewfinder for most shots, except when I need more precise framing for close-ups. I have a 128 MB memory card, but 64 MB would be sufficient for most people. If you find one of these cameras on the used market, I suggest that you buy it."
4,"Small, but some draw-backs","I have owned about 4 digital cameras so far, and this one is the smallest by far. While I like it's size, there are a couple of things I do not like about this camera:1: I do not care for the smart media format. Not enough memory.2: The zoom is not big enough3: The colors are a little reddish4: The LCD screen is too small, making it hard to judge if you made a good picture worth saving or notEventhough it has these drawbacks, it is still a nice camera that will get used a lot because of it's size. The noise reduction feature works well, which is a definate plus if you plan to make a lot of pictures at night."
5,GREAT DIGITAL CAMERA!,WHAT CAN I SAY!!!!! IT'S A GREAT LITTLE CAMERA. THAT FITS ON YOUR PALM... HIGHLY RECOMMEND...
5,Beautiful little camera,"Thinking to get Canon S40 but ended up with D40 due to many good reviews of this camera.I like the panorama mode that is built in this little camera. Software is top notch, you can print different pictures on a photo paper instead of printing one at a time. I had this camera for 2 weeks now, still using the battery that comes with it."
3,"great quality photos, poor battery management","The quality of the photos that we've taken with this camera have exceeded our expectations, but it has two problems. The response time is slow and the battery management has been poor. On a number of occations, the camera has indicated a low-battery condition and refused to take a photo even with newly charged batteries. We close the camera, open it, and then it shows a fully charged battery - but we have missed the photo op."
1,Too big to swallow !,The product description is deceptive. No where on the description does it states that the serving size is 4 humungous tablets. This is probably one of the most expensive calcium/magnesium supplement on amazon.
4,Delta 36-431,"Everything is great except for the extenstion table. The laminated table surface is not even close to flat and the dimensions in the assembly manual for the legs are incorrect. Aside from these gripes the saw is well made. All parts were included in the shipping boxes, the cast iron tops are flat as can be, and the assembly was very smooth. The splitter guard is a pain. Align the motor well before attaching it!"
5,Midsomer Murders: Village Case Files,"Love this series, love this set -- I have the other 2 larger sets and feel the same about them. I also love the compactness of the packaging for all the discs. The only thing I don't like is how difficult the discs are to get out. The center rings just don't want to let go of the disc. BUT that would certainly not stop me from owning these 3 sets or buying another one if they make one."
5,Murder madness is magnificent,"While I am soo glad I don't LIVE in Midsomer (I mean, with all these murders I might be next), this series is soo much fun, I have ordered my third and final collection: The Early Cases. (OK, so I went a bit out of order). Although John Nettles as DCI Barnaby can be a maddeningly inconsiderate and thoughtless husband, he is SPOT ON when it comes to solving murders. These stories give Agatha Christie a true run for her money, and she is my MOST FAVORITE mystery novelist. If you've never seen the show, like I hadn't, get the first series, well, first. After that I went on a shopping spree and now have Barnaby's Casebook, Village Case Files and soon to come, the Early Cases. Can't wait. Do yourself, and your brain, a favor. Get as many of these on dvd as you can."
5,Love this series,I love this series. I'm hooked John Nettles is great. I love the scenery & the story lines are great. The stories have murder but it is done in such a tasteful way. No one else could play Barnaby like Nettles. I will continue to buy this series. I have all three of the box sets & can't wait for the next-if it takes too long I will just buy them separately. I like all of the actors that have played his partners-they each bring their own spice to the show. I am a fan for life.
3,"Nothing new to see here, folks.","While I thought this was fairly well written as magick books go, Ostara did not inspire me. Granted, the history of this sabbat may hard topic to write about. What I really found lacking was the ritual / spell aspects. It was just a rehashing of correspondence tables that we have seen many times before. McCoy does not give us a real, solid ritual to work off of. I read through the book once and went through it about half a dozen times looking for something to inspire me but came up short. It is not awful, just not that great."
5,Great for all levels!,"Edain McCoy is one of the best authors on the team of Llewellyns staff of Witchery. This is one of her best books as well. The spring equinox is one of my favorite times of the year. One cannot go wrong when the yearning for youth is inherent in all of us.This book provides the reader with all the lore and legend of this splendid time of the year. From spring flower magic to some great recipies that I have tried and wonderful lore of fairies! One simply cannot go wrong. Ms McCoy has much experience under her belt. I remember her earlier work in the 1980s!True, to the purist out there there are many flaws. My comment on this is ""let us see you do a better job"". Enjoy it for what it is: a book about a magical heart!"
5,Awesome,I loved this CD...I have Taylor's Under the Radar which I love too. It has been so long since the show ended that I didn't think his album was ever going to come out. Totally worth the wait. Can't wait to see what he does with his sophmore album. Go Taylor!
3,"Good, not great","I liked this album but didn't love it. I really enjoyed watching Taylor Hicks on American Idol, and I think I might enjoy watching him live than listening to a recording. Something is missing from this studio recording, the soulful voice and aura that I know Taylor Hicks has does not shine through on this recording.Taylor is, however, one of my favorite idols, but I don't think that this album does him justice. There are a few good parts, but for the most part, it sounds rather karaoke-ish and there are many parts that just make me want to skip to the next track."
4,Good sound. No a lot like Idol.,"Yea, I like about every song on here and I'm really more a fan of harder rock. A couple songs are very flashy just like I remember from the tv show but believe it or not, I like the slower, more soulful sounds that Taylor brought in this CD even more. It's not much like idol because they aren't familiar songs and because he sings them his way instead of like the original artists. Overall, Taylor made a nice collection with a little variety and a lot of good sounds."
3,Somewhat disappointed...huge expectations,"Taylor is a fantastic talent but will soon learn that it is not just a song and a talent but a very good producer who makes a great album. The song ""runaround"" was fabulous but the rest of them sound like Taylor was just going through the motions. I know he has spent some time here in Nashville, but he needs to come back and write some great songs with some fabulous writers.I also wonder if he is just an entertainer? He is so electrifying as a performer, I just wonder if hearing him only is a letdown. I really thought the rest of the album was pretty ordinary and I know he is better than that.Taylor Hicks has the potential to be the artist of the decade but this kind of material will make you forget him pretty quickly. I thought my three stars was generous...."
2,disappointing,I was very disappointed by this album. I felt the songs were very pedestrian and that Taylor's singing was sometimes weak. On the first track it sounded almost like he was being drowned out by the band. I got no sense of any of the excitement that Hicks generated on his Idol appearances. He's a decent singer but I feel that the songs on this album weren't good enough.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this CD because I fell in love with Taylor Hick's soulful voice. I was disappointed with the song choices and predictable arrangements. I hope Taylor had no say in the selections because that would lead me to believe that perhaps his next CD would be better. I'm not sure if Taylor's personal song genre is soul or R&B but that's what I fell in love with on American Idol and his CD prior to A.I. Listening to him do anything but, I guess I'd have to get used to."
3,"Good, but not outstanding","I am a fan from the show and was really looking forward to his release. There are some songs that are great, but some fall flat."
3,Disappointed,"While I loved Taylor on Idol and thought he should win over McPhee, I was disappointed in this CD. I thought it would be more of his bluesy songs but found more of a pop 80's sound. Still love his voice and think he's very talented, but was hoping for something more his ""style"". And where was the harmonica???"
5,Taylor is HOT!,"Taylor's new CD is awesome. I don't have very many CDs where I like every song, but this is one of them. My favorites are Runaround, Heaven Knows, Gonna Move, The Maze, and Just To Feel That Way. Of course I love Soul Thing and The Deal because Taylor himself wrote these. And The Right Place is wonderful too. Taylor is going far with this one, he is so awesome."
2,The Soul Patrol Didn't Show Up,"I was so looking forward to Taylor's first CD - from his first audition on American Idol, I became a fan for his individualistic style and the fact that he nails it on my favorite genre of music - The Blues. I am disappointed with his CD because it does not have the edge or the hard-driving rock/blues that I was hoping for. I enjoyed the taping at [...] more than the CD."
3,A little disappointed,I loved Taylor on IDOL and voted for him many times but I just didn't feel his personality came through on his first CD. I was a little disappointed in this one.
3,Not the best,some of the songs were really enjoyable but not enough for me to reccomend this CD. Sorry Taylor!
5,Taylor Hicks self-titled CD,"I have enjoyed this CD for several months and never tire of listening to it. I think you will find picking a favorite song from it will be difficult, because everytime you listen your favorite will change. I highly recommend owning this terrific CD."
5,SUPER CD,This cd has the distinction of being one of the few in many years that I have liked all the songs on. This is very rare for me. Every song brings something good to the table. This cd has something for everyone. Very enjoyable.
5,It blew me away!,"Taylor's first album was really worth the wait, it really shows why he was crowned this year's American Idol - he takes a song and infuses it with his great voice and heartfelt soul. There's lots of great songs on this album that will make you dance (""The Runaround""), groove (""Heaven Knows"", ""Gonna Move"") and smile (""Dream Myself Awake"", ""The Right Place""), plus the re-arrangements on his originals ""Soul Thing"" and ""The Deal"" are terrific. It's an excellent mix of many different genres that will cater to a lot of different musical tastes.Taylor's bringing life back into mainstream music, his style is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise bland world of pop divas and overprocessed rap and hip-hop. He has the potential to take the world by storm. Way to go, Taylor!"
4,Taylor Hicks,"Taylor Hicks' self-titled CD shows off his vocal talents very well. It contains some very upbeat songs that will make you feel like dancing, such as ""Heaven Knows"" and ""Give Me Tonight."" There are two songs that Taylor Hicks wrote himself: ""Soul Thing"" and ""The Deal,"" both of which are high quality. The CD closes with the soulful, ""The Right Place.""Taylor Hicks and Carrie Underwood certainly have left some big shoes for the next American Idol to fill!"
4,Taylor Hicks has a winning debut !,"This silver haired Southern comfort, all of 30 yrs. old, has a timeless vocal style, which most of America was lucky to hear on American Idol last season. While maybe not the top choice of young teens, Hicks is definitely a tonic for we who are adults. This CD did not disappoint, in fact it is quite good. The Runaround has hit written all through its dynamic arrangement and Hicks delivery. The great music doesn;t stop there though. The vast number of selections on this CD are great listening, singing, and even dancing songs. This debut CD comes on the heels of Do I Make You Proud, an endearing single which I recently heard dedicated by a women at a local Washington, DC club to our brave men and women in the military. Once Mr. Hicks starts gyrating to these songs during his tour, we'll see even more value from this CD. Hicks is a double delight- he sings beautifully, AND he dances quite naturally well. Well done, and well worth the wait."
4,Taylor Hicks CD,I like Taylor's singing. The CD showed off histalent. I miss his dancing though.I would purchase a DVD of him singingand dancing.
5,I love Taylor Hicks,"He's not just for old people, he has the best voice and personality and he deserved to win. His cd is a great Christmas present. Thank you Taylor. Iam glad your doing the Orange Bowl. I hope you sing more than 2 songs. I like Runaround, but also all the others!"
5,great music! Why isn't it being played on the radio?,"This is a great CD. Every song is worth listening to. To be honest, the worst song is the first one on the album which is his first release. I'm not sure why they picked that one. There are so many others that are so much better. Anyway, I highly recommend the CD. I wish they would play the music on the radio."
5,Taylor hit a homerun with this album!,"Although this album hasn't had the support of American Idol or radio stations, it's far and away better than rumor says it is. Those who say Taylor's album is nowhere in sales should give it a listen. I love, love, love it. It's upbeat and makes it hard to keep your feet still. There is a little bit of everything, the band is outstanding and Taylor's harp really rocks. He's touring it right now and will be for a long, long time to sold-out venues."
3,Love Taylor- disappointed in the music,"I was a Taylor fan from the moment he sang for the judges and they sent him on to Hollywood. I watched week after week and even bought his first cd before Idol. I waited eagerly for this cd to come out and then...I was so disappointed. He has a great voice but this cd is missing what I loved about Taylor the most- his heart and soul. It is too pop I guess- just not enough of the stuff that made us fall in love with him in the first place. But I am a true Taylor fan and I hope his next cd will be more of that ""old"" Taylor rather than the pop version."
2,Hicks,I thought all the songs sounded a like. I really liked him on Idol and wish he would have shook it up some.
2,Was hoping for a litle more.....,"This CD is not what I expected from Taylor, someone whom I enjoyed on American Idol. While he was very enjoyable to WATCH on American Idol, his voice is nothing special to LISTEN to. I'd hoped for a little more originality and stronger vocals, but this CD was a bit of a disappointment for me. Taylor is a performer NOT a singer. I'm sure he is fun to see in concert, but I won't buy another CD because his voice just doesn't grab me or hold my interest. There were a lot better singers on American Idol this year, which is usually know for producing great singers. Taylor doesn't measure up to his predecessors vocally."
2,Bland music,I thought the cd was terrible. The music was bland. His vocals were good but the song choice was bad. I found the music to be very boring. On the positive side I did like his songs better than the covers. It is just not my style of music.
2,Disappointed...but....,i wasnt thrilled with this cd...im the type of person that needs to be hooked the 1st time i listen to a cd otherwise its going to gather dust....im guessing its not my type of music and i only like Taylor's Covers....or im just a biased Idols fan and really wanted Elliot or Chris to win...so im not sure....the quality is good...just maybe it was a good idea to move this through the family and onto my dad..sorry taylor
2,no visual,"In listening to this disc, about half dozen times. I realized one thing. TH's Stage antics, definitely made him win AI. This CD is okay, almost sounding a bit karaoke at times. First Single Runaround was not the correct choice, imho. I really wa slooking forward to this cd (as well as Daughtry's). I keep listening, hoping to like it more, but honestly, I can't see myself picking this cd out of my collection in a few months, and saying ""oh I haven't heard that in a while."" He should have looked at someone like MArc Broussard for inspiration. His voice is suited for cajun style blues pop.Good luck next time TH, you deserve better than this cd."
1,Can't sing,"Like I've said before, the dude can't sing. His a very entertaining entertainer when he's on stage, but when he's not on stage putting on a show, he just can't sing."
4,we all LOVE Taylor...right?,"He's the kind of unpretentious guy we all would enjoy hanging with. His parents indeed ""must be proud"". At the risk of getting absolutely slammed by his admirers who frequent this site I must say that I fear he is not going to have real staying power strictly as a vocalist. He is a talent to be sure: a refreshing vocalist with a stage presence that wins. But I'm not sure he is going to be able to make it as a recording artist. His agent needs to somehow exploit that incredible winning personality. A talk show host? Perhaps, besides if Rachel Ray can do it, Taylor certainly could. I hope we see a lot more of Taylor Hicks."
3,Cheap production for what should be a grand slam artist,"Well, here's the deal. We all know Taylor Hicks is the latest phenom in soul and blues rock, but the production team on this CD was in too much of a hurry to care. It got produced. Shoddily. It got sold. Quickly. And it flamed out. Early. We all know a well produced album when we hear one, and Taylor deserves quite a few of them in the future. I'm looking forward to them. Two stars for the CD, plus a bonus star in honor of our American Idol winner makes it barely a 3 star in my book. Wait for a Taylor Hicks written (his originals are really good songs) and professionaly well produced effort to come out before putting your money down."
3,Someone threw water on the fire!,"I had such hope for Taylor. I'm not sure who is most responsible for this disappointing album, but it just does not do justice to the fire and love of music that Taylor demonstrated on his AI days. Someone needs to add some gas to that fire, before Taylor goes the way of Clay Aiken. Where is the spark that kindled the blaze?"
2,Not what I expected!,"I was very disappointed with this CD! Taylor Hicks does not sound at all like he did on American Idol! The song choices do not reflect his soulful ""Joe Cocker"" sound! Wish I would have waited to see a review like this before deciding to buy!"
5,YAY!,"Finally, for the first time in years, an album that I can sing and dance to and actually know all the words to the songs. I loved Taylor on American Idol and I'm glad that he has this opportunity to share his talent with everyone. My favorite song is Heaven Knows, which reminds me of something Elvis would do and I also adore Gonna Move. There isn't a song on this album that doesn't capture my attention. Great job and I'm looking forward to many more albums in the years to come."
5,HELL OF A CD!,THIS CD WAS WORTH THE WAIT. THERE IS SOMETHING ON IT FOR EVERYONE TO ENJOY I AM REALLY ENJOYING IT
5,Enjoy his voice!,"The d is ok. I gave him 5 stars because he's talented. His next cd will be better.This one is a Clive Davis quickie, typical American Idol first cd. Taylor will eventually use a different label."
5,Terrific!,"Do I love every track on this CD? No. But I enjoy a vast majority, and therefore, feel it is well worth the investment! Runaround is simplistic in its lyrics, but I find that I cannot listen to it without singing along and tapping my toes. The Taylor I love is missing in Dream Myself Awake, but luckily resurfaces in the fantastic Heaven Knows, which is really where the album starts for me. Stellar covers of Gonna Move and Wherever I Lay My Hat follow. For me, the album is worth the price for these three songs alone. Taylor takes a wrong turn (IMO) on Give Me Tonight. Just to Feel That Way is a decent, totally listenable power ballad. The Maze and Places I Have Been are unoffensive filler. Then Taylor finishes in true Taylor style with his two original tunes, Soul Thing and The Deal, and the remarkable The Right Place. Why 5 stars? Because I can't remember the last time I purchased a CD that I enjoyed so much. A great freshman release!!"
5,Taylor Hicks CD,"Taylor Hicks did not dissappoint with this CD.It's fresh, soulful and just makes you want to move to it's beat. The songs are new and different deserving of Taylor's ""Modern Womp"" description. Taylor's compassion for what he does so well is felt throughout this CD that the music seems to move right from his soul into yours as you listen. Highly recommended, especially if you're ready to experience something that offers a refreshing change from today's usual pop music sound."
5,Taylor Hicks,Taylors CD is great. I liked him from the first time I heard him on Idol.There isn't a lot of music for us older folks these days and Taylor keeps everyone happy!
4,Taylor works it.,"Given the material here and the short amount of time Taylor had to produce an album, I think he did a good job. He has a voice that is sure to stick around. He's a very talented artist and I think this CD reflects that. I've noticed it's slightly toned down on here as compared to his live performances, but it's still worth a listen. Notable tracks to me are The Maze and Give Me Tonight (I'm surprised that most don't like this one) Overall, very good debut and Taylor didn't disappoint. Nice work, Taylor. :) On a side note, I'm glad they didn't put Do I Make You Proud on here because the more new tracks, the better. ;)"
3,I love Taylor BUT I am DISAPPOINTED,"I LOVE TAYLOR HICKS. The songs are GREAT, I AT FIRST didn't like some of them, but they grew on me as I listened, and now I love them. I went to see him LIVE in CONCERT in Big Flats, NY and he was AWESOME! He performed them. He took these songs and made them sooooo COOL! He really rocked them! He took them, ad libbed them and went to TOWN!!!!!!!!!!! OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I WANT A COPY OF THAT CONCERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHOA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THATS THE TAYLOR HICKS I LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not worth the money,"Maybe seeing Taylor in a live performance would be worth it, but the CD is ho-hum."
3,Likable man...forgettable music,"I think Taylor Hicks is probably very good to great at what he has been doing for the last 10 years or so. Keeping great soul music alive in clubs despite the current trends that have all but ruined the R&B genre recently. I think as a club singer, I would never be disappointed in paying to see him. However, does that mean he is meant to make studio albums? I would say that my impression after my wife got this CD, has got to be no. Maybe in the future, he will surprise me, but this CD, exactly like Bo Bice, before him, it seems to me that they are both very good Karaoke (or cover band) singers given the original song was done with a voice that is similar to theirs, other than that... Well, seeing (or hearing) is believing and as for now I'm not convinced."
3,Not as good as I was hoping for...,"I was really looking forward to Taylor's debut album... I really loved his first ""single"", Do I Make You Proud. And that song wasn't even on his new CD??? On my first listen, I honestly thought I was going to throw the CD away because it was sooooo NOT what I was hoping for.However, to be honest, I've given it a couple of listens, and there are at least 4 songs that are really growing on me:1. Dream Myself Awake2. Just to Feel That Way3. Places I've Been4. Wherever I Lay My HatSo I'm not quite as dissapointed as I was originally. I still think ""Do I Make You Proud"" is his best song though..."
3,Taylor sold his Soul,"There are about three songs on this CD that I play. The rest could be anyone singing. When I checked, it appears the songs I like are the songs he had a hand in writing. He knows his style, what showcases his voice. I kept waiting for that voice, that individual style to be displayed in each of his songs. Why does it seem that the non winners do better? Are ""winners"" limited to specific song writers? Taylor, I am not giving up on you. You have what it takes, don't let them take it away. Review the Idol tapes and see what made the audience go crazy. Get back to that."
2,Taylor Hicks,Disappointing. Didn't like the song selection. Too much productin and not enough grit and soul. I'll wait for the next release and hope for better.
3,A Good Effort but Not The Best,"First of all, let me say that I was really looking forward to this album. Taylor was a breath of fresh air on the show - his talent, voice, stage presence and personality. However, not all of it comes thru on this, his first ""after Idol"" album.The album doesn't do the best job of showcasing his talent. The songs he wrote are the best (especially near the end of the album), but my issue with this album is that the songs all sound the same. I was listening to it a second time, and I hadn't realized that 3 songs had gone by! I thought it was the same song! The songs mentioned by the first reviewer on this page are the best, but I hope that his next album will be better produced. I hope that they let him have more of his own written songs on the album, and that they mix up the songs, i.e. have more variety on the album. I look forward to his next album to really show us what he can do. Because I really like him and think he's really talented."
