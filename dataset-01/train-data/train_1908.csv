3,Studying,"Its a good read, but possibly a bit lacking if you want it to be used for studying purposes."
5,LOVE IT!!,"I have to say that I started off watching this show on cable on demand and thinking ""what that heck does the L stand for?"" one I saw a few scenes I said oooohhhh. I have been hooked since my first ooohhh. Every episode of every season gets better and better, and I often find myself wondering how they can top one season after the other but they do it. If you want to catch up or just see what all the fuss is about but might not want to get the dvd I suggest the unboxed downloads. Same great quality and still able to view any time. Enjoy!"
5,A powerful score in the best submarine tradition,"Klaus Doldinger's score to Das Boot has the same intensity and power that make Zimmer's Crimson Tide and Poledouris' Hunt for Red October such great music. Has a good mix of techno-like rhythms and lonely accoustic music.The CD has some non-source music from the film (Muss I Denn, Mon Gars), and a few of the tracks are repeated with the character's German dialogue.I actually bought my copy in Austria, but the new Director's Cut version has the same material."
4,Decent Pizza Cutter,"I received one of these as a birthday gift about two years ago, and the little thing is still going strong. The vocal unit is still loud (enough) and clear. It's the same as when it was new. The cutting blade is a little dull, but still slices through the pizza I get without a problem. I'm not sure how sharp ""real"" pizza cutters are supposed to be, but this works pretty decently. I'd get another one if I needed to."
4,Richard a sheetmetal journeymen from Michigan,"I've had this drill for over 2 yrs and just love it. I've tried the millwaukee and dewalt, give me the PC everytime."
2,Not How It Was,"Well, this book isn't really the way it happened. Some of you may recall that I was initially recruited to UNC starting with Coach Guthridge, and then followed up with Coach Doherty. I had some concerns about Matt and his lack of experience, but I thought I'd try to stick it out.That was a horrible mistake. Coach Doherty was all sweetness when talking in front of my parents, but in practice his mouth was fouler than a longshoreman. Life in Chapel Hill was a living hell for me and my teammates. Since it was clear I was in Doh's doghouse from day one, I decided to transfer. Lo and behold, they changed coaches at UCLA, too."
5,"Fun, thrills, laughs","What a treat, what a refreshing read. None of that cant and self-righteousness you find in so many outdoor-related books nowadays. This book is pure fun and adventure from start to finish. And sadly, that finish came too soon for me. I read it in two nights."
3,What about the danger?,"The author mention that there were 3 deaths in 1999. My friend happened to be one of those statistics. He was also a member of one of the groups you mentioned, The Sea Tigers.I think this is an exciting sport. However going below the depth of 200ft is crazy. Divers please strickly enforce the ""depth rule""."
2,In defense of oil rig diving,"I also have done a lot of diving and spearfishing under oil rigs albeit off the Texas Coast, not Louisiana. But a triggerfish is a triggerfish and what is written in this book about them is pure fiction. I'm not saying you'll never be nipped by a trigger fish though they're more likely to tug at your hair than bite you. You're certainly not going to climb out of the boat with one hanging on to you. There is great diving around the oil rigs and I would not want anyone to be spooked away from doing so thinking they will be devoured by trigger fish. There's a lot of fiction in this book. It's entertaining and Mr. Fontova's political views are pretty much in line with mine but it does not portray a realistic view of diving and spearfishing around the oil rigs."
5,Great entertainment,"I bought this book last night. Needless to say I was late to work today from reading all night. I shoot alot of fish in the Fla Gulf, but nothing compares to the environment these guys are hunting in. As a spearfisherman I can imagine what these guys are diving in and some of the stories sent shivers up by spine. What makes the book so amazing is that Fontova is still alive and able to write this book. What a bunch of stupid, idiotic bunch of rednecks. Sounds like my group of friends. A must read for any true sportsman, who puts competition above most everything else."
4,Quality item,"I bought this for my Granddaughter for Christmas because she loves Curious George. With shipping charges, this item came to nearly $8. I can't beleive I spent that much for a toothbrush, but I'll do just about anything for my grandkids."
3,"I can't believe I was soooo ""heavy"".","Listening to Vanilla Fudge after so many years/decades made me realize how ""heavy"" I was and how much fun I had. Brings back some fun memories."
5,The best of 60's music,"This project reminds me that great music came out of the 60's, not just ""groovy"" schtick. Vanilla Fudge worked music much like clay, not just 4:4 beat, Great dynamics..going soft, then booming volume. If ever you can see Ed Sullivans old show with Vanilla Fudge like I did last week on cable, it was a treat worth trying to locate."
5,"One of the greatest debuts in history, and one of my favorite albums...","This is a superb album. Whoever would have thought that an album of all covers would be so successful, artistically and financially? Vanilla Fudge's biggest hit, You Keep Me Hangin' On, is far superior to the original version. It's an epic cover, running 7 1/2 minutes. Elenaor Rigby and Ticket to Ride are fantastic too. These songs are not straight forward covers. The Fudge took them and changed them drastically, but in an original and dramatic way, which is why they work so well. Their playing is incredibly intense as well. I always thought Vanilla Fudge could have been an American Pink Floyd, with their spooky, epic sound, but after this album, they put out a horrible ""experimental"" album called The Beat Goes On. They did release 3 more albums (which were excellent), but the ""beat"" album really screwed up their career. This is their best one. Play it loud and often..."
4,What's with the Track Order?,"I remember the first time I heard this album, and it's psychedelic covers are still some of my favorite music. My only negative comment on this album is regarding the track order. I know this is not the original order as it went:Illusions of My Childhood pt. 1Keep Me Hanging OnIllusions of My Childhood pt. 2Take Me For A Little WhileIllusions of My Childhood pt. 3She's Not ThereBang Bang""The following is a serious of high frequency tones...""-End of Side A-""This record was recorded using..."" (or some such)Ticket to RidePeople Get ReadyEleanor Rigby / Strawberry Fields excerptI just don't understand why tracks are rearranged when some great albums are translated onto a CD. At least they didn't add any of those God-awful bonus tracks (i.e. all of the bonus tracks ever made) that they so enjoy ruining my most remastered CDs with."
4,NOT BAD!!!,"kind of a classic album after all these years...after arriving in mail, i enjoyed the first listen (again) very much...had LP years and years ago, sounds as good today as it did then...you won't be disappointed."
4,Incredible realism,"Upside- One of the best action games around that will glue your behind to the chair until you kill off all the terorists!Downside- THIS IS NOT FOR KIDS 16 AND UNDER! EXTREMELY VIOLENT. In addition, the game will suck up a ton of RAM and may not operate well on slow low RAM computers. Nevertheless, even with the hassles, a fantastic game to play!!"
1,Horrible,"This game was so horrible it kept freezing up over and over. I think it was a big sham and whoever made this, I have no idea how it ever made it on a disc. I later checked it out online. Everything I found out about this game was how pathetic it was! The only good thing about it was it that it was shipped fast. That was good, the game was horrible, I threw it in the dumpster!"
1,Amazon.com needs a zero rating just for NWO,"Avoid this game at all costs. The framerate drops into single digits during gameplay, which means it's choppy almost all the time. Once you get into a firefight, it gets so bad, it's almost unplayable.Voice acting is a joke, it sounds like it was recorded on a home PC on the cheapest mic you could find. Graphics are dated about 1994, slightly better than Wofenstein 3D, slightly worse than Quake I.The missions are generic, and the only real difficulty to this game is surviving the rounds because of all the chop caused by the slow framerate. This game is bound for the discount bin, and even then, I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Great,"OK, unless you have a good computer you cant really get the best out of this game, like the guy who has written the other review. I happen to have a TOP spec computer in the form of an Alienware Aurora DDR (3.0Ghz 800mhz FSB, 1gig Corsair XMS RAM, Audigy plat. 2 EX soundcard), the sound is brilliant with a good speaker setup(6.1 Megaworx 600watt) and a brilliant graph card (Geforce FX 5800 Ultra), so if you have all that then go for it, the game rocks, esp. in multiplayer mode. You can get by with a P4 2.4GHZ too, and a Ti4600, 512Mb RAM, 300 watt speakers(5.1), with that spec. it will run smooth enough for you to have minimal problems."
4,my 5 yrs old son loves it!!,my 5yrs old son loves it. great toys. but small should be a little bigger.
1,[not a good deal],"""Reconditioned."" I don't think so. Both batteries were shot and the saw blade had been damaged. After I replaced the blade and the batteries I would have been much better off buying a new outfit."
1,Disappointment,"I bought this item thinking it would last me a while because I would be using it as a home owner and not a contractor, I was wrong. I was happpy with the performance until high gear went out on the drill. This occured after the factory warrantee was up which left me a powerful slow drill with no other features. I will never buy a reconditioned tool again. I should also state that I do have other porter cable products that am very happy with."
1,Don't waste your money...,I bought the driver and saw kit and the hammer drill kit...new. In the first year I replaced the drill/drivers three times...while under warranty. The saw worked well and the flashlight was the best part of this kit. Now it is a couple years old and the batteries are dead and at $90 each I am not replacing them. I bought Hitachi this time with a five year warranty. I wasted $600 on the Porter Cable junk.
1,doomed to failure,The thing about the Clash was that they had such strong personalities that their songs transcended the notes on the page. A faithful rendering musically would lack that wonderful charisma that made them the greatest band in the world for the first 5 years of their career. (The last 2 years are best forgotten...) Almost none of these bands have got the charisma to pull off Clash songs. They wind up turning them into dull little jingles that sound as average as any of the slop most of these bands put out themselves. Just do yourself a favor and buy the genuine article. It doesn't get any better in rock than London Calling.
1,This CD makes me CRINGE,"This was absolute torture for me, being the huge Clash fan that I am. With each new song I actually cringed. I was so disgusted with this album. ""Should I Stay or Should I Go?"" was completely butchered by Ice Cube and that other dude. What were these people thinking when they actually thought this album was good enough to release? It doesn't sound like a tribute album... it sounds like people trying to destroy the Clash !"
1,Not For Clash Fans,"I wish I would of read these reviews before I wasted my money on this CD. Someone may enjoy this, but it won't be a true Clash fan. Please, do yourself a favor, and pass this one by."
1,"Inhumanity, in the form of a CD!","Please, don't buy this cd. It will make you regret the day you were born. When I first this compact disc, it made me want to cut my wrists. Fortunatly for me, I was in a music store, so I could go to the REAL clash section, get their first cd, and listen to it. It saved my life. As far as this cd goes...if the clash were jesus, then this is satan/aka mephistapheles, or maybe the anti christ. This is kryptonite to superman, it is a shower to a gutter punk. This cd should be banned, so it doesn't hurt anyone else. It really makes me wish that the united states didn't have freedom of speech, so it could be legally taken from the market by the government, and kept from polluting the minds of the children of america."
1,"I hate to say ""Me too"", but...","THIS ALBUM IS HORRID. There are a few redeeming moments, such as The Urge's faithful cover of ""Radio Clash"" and the Indigo Girls acoustic punk ""Clampdown"", but Moby and Mack 10 are so bloody awful that I'm afraid to put this disc near my stereo. I still like the Bosstones after listening to this, but it made me hate the Afghan Whigs. Silverchair? Don't get me started...."
1,blah,"ok first off, joe strummer rip. i'm a big clash fan, second generation to be exact... me mum was a punk rocker. ok i thought this cd would be cool, a tribute by mainstream artists, i have to admit at one point during my adolescence i listened to some of these bands... so ithought hey maybe this will be decent. not in the least, if ya like the clash go buy a clash record or cd. if you wanna try a tribute try city rockers, that was good. i didnt know whether to laugh or to cry when i heard should i stay or should i go by ice cube. nothing against rap it just was an abomination. but you might like that sorta thing. and moby?!? no thank you. at least they have enough respect for the clash to do a tribute, but thats as optimistic as i can be, and even thats a bit much for a ""punk rocker"""
2,This CD sucks except for a couple bright spots,"Most of the artists on this album are weak pathetic fools who lack the talent to cover the Clash. the only true exception to this is 311's version of White man in Hammersmith Palais which I think is really good, because 311 is also such an awesome band. But pretty much everyone else on here is crappy. Especially Ice Cube and mack 10, those guys are complete idiots."
1,The Clash the only band that matters,This album is OK if one or more of the bands on it are personal favourites but as an album I found it almost unlistenable. No one really adds anything special or new to the songs and the Clash just did it a 1000 times better the first time round! Stick to the originals it safer and much better value for money.
1,This album ddoesn't deserve one star,"this whole album from beginning to end is not even worth being printed! If somone offers to give this cd to you don't take it, it isn't even worth the space it would take up. This is definately the worst tribute I have ever heard!"
4,For those who couldn't understand the words before.,"I always anticipate these 'Tribute' albums with a mixture of hope and dread. This one is a pleasant suprise. As usual, the best tracks are the ones where the artist is not attempting to simply reproduce the original. I couldn't disagree with Steven Stolder more, I thought the Indigo Girls version of 'Clampdown' proved just what great lyricists the Clash were. The Clash were never so easy to categorise politically, those fortunate enough to see the film 'Rude Boy' (possibly never seen in the US?)would appreciate what I mean. My favourite is 'Clash City Rockers' (only on the import version?), which for me evokes the real spirit of the Clash I remember live in Sydney just after London Calling was released. Essential for any Clash fan."
1,Who's Responsible ForThis,"I can't believe my ears!!! Could this be a joke, a publicity stunt, or Joe Strummers attempt to swindle the public. I would respect the third option the most. I beg of anyone that reads this not to waste your time or money. If you want to pay tribute to the Clash, go buy one of their albums.....Any of them would be far greater than this fiasco. To the bands who participated, it's not your fault, I would never pass up the chance to cover one of the greatest bands of all time. To the traitor who decided on the bands, think of the great punk bands who were actually influenced by your music, and how much they would have enjoyed covering the greats. I can only hope the members of the Clash had little to do(if anything at all) with this nonsense. As much as I hate to bash anything that involves the Clash, this is a pathetic attempt of a tribute album!!!!"
1,Culture CLASH,"What can you say about this thing? It doesn't even sound like a good idea. And it wasn't. I'm not a purist. I love covers. I seek out rare B-sides and Bootlegs just to hear bands doing somebody elses songs...but there is a limit. No Doubt? Indigo Girls? Dwight Yoakam showed more passion when he covered Train in Vain honky-Tonk style. Besides, Garbage already 'covered' the song with Stupid Girl.I love to see the Clash reach a new audience. I think it's great that Ice Cube came on board. The cause is more than worthy so I hope it raises tons of money for the Children's Hospital, but as far as tribute albums go...this is more a tribute to 90's one hit wonders than the Clash.But I will say this...(and I'm not a big fan, but...) Thank God for the Afgham Whigs."
3,"interesting, but not especially great","Most of the tracks on this album are okay--nothing special, but by no means awful. The standouts are Heather Nova and Moby on ""Straight to Hell"", Cracker doing ""White Riot"", the Indigo Girls covering ""Clampdown"", and 311's version of ""White Man in Hammersmith Palais"". The other tracks are all decent, but noticeably weaker than the Clash originals. Silverchair and Ice Cube with Mack 10 were stronger than I expected, but this album is really best for people who love the Clash's songs but think someone else should have been performing them. If you're a die-hard fan of any of the bands (except the Clash) involved in this album (especially Heather Nova or the Indigo Girls), you may be interested in this album, but otherwise, it's not worth your money."
1,Deserves a lower score than one star,what the hell is this? this has got to be one of the worst cd's ive heard in a while. Its a joke to hear the clash's great songs butchered by the likes of ice cube and silverchair. This album is not so much a tribute as it is a smack in the face. DO NOT BUY THIS!
1,Why can't I give this compilation ZERO stars?,"Dreadful. This horrible ""tribute"" only serves to prove that today's hip-hop and alt-rock performers have style, but no substance - and no real understanding of incendiary rock (it's more than fashion, yo). Ice Cube and Mack 10 doing a rap version of ""Should I Stay or Should I Go""? Just go, guys, just go."
1,don't waste your money,I didn't know it was possible but most of these bands perticularly Korn have managed to remove every last bit of emotion from these songs. It honostly makes me sad to here some of my favorite songs played like this
4,Get a Grip,"Although I am also fan of Clash, I got so used to all of their songs that sadly enough, I don't listen to Clash anymore. By pure accident I found that CD on a shelf at my local HMV store and bought it. And I have to admit that it's not that bad. Actually I like it quite a lot and "" Should I Stay or Should I Go"" is probably my favourite track after ""Straight to Hell"". It is different than Clash, but it gives the old songs new dimention. Definitely recommended."
1,Go Straight to Hell Boys...,"Sorry, it's not something personal against the band whose appear on this tribute but...I can't believe they had the courage to do this!, the styles are too much differents, the only reason that this cd has 1 star is because Rancid plays one, they play the only one good song...all other bands should play something into their styles, I'm sure they could make a real good job with other kind of music, but....let the punk rock to the punk rockers.or do you imagine to Sex Pistols on a Back Streets Boys tribute?"
2,Strummer Deserves Better,"Its a shame, most of these songs are just an attempt to exploit Clash and Joe Strummer fans. The only track that had ANY value was the cover of ""Rudie Cant Fail"" by the Mighty Mighty Bosstones."
1,What a Waste,"I had hopes for this, but was severely let down. It is really a diservice to the Clash and a pitiful album. It was all I could do to hold down the contents of my stomach while listening to Ice Cube/Mack 10/Korn perform. That has to be by far the worst track on the whole cd and the main reason not to by it."
2,Not that good,"The intention was good, but the execution leaves something to be desired. And I like a lot of these bands, too. If you want to hear some really cool punk bands do the Clash, check out Backlash: Tribute To The Clash. It's much better than this lame attempt."
1,Whaaaat?!,"While I don't doubt that the Clash has had musical influences on just about any musician in the 80's and 90's, I find it hard to believe that these made-for-alt-pop-commercial pabulum spewers were the best they could find to acknowledge this (exceptions to the Bosstones and Cube). This compilation just goes to prove that corporate music has reinserted its head up its arse - one of the very things the Clash railed against in the late 70's. I mean c'mon - 311...Third Eye Blind! Give the chance to cover our heros to those who follow in their footsteps and force change in a stagnant music industry - no matter what musical genre. I've heard Jr. Brown covers the Clash - there's a novel idea. Please, if you want to pay tribute to these legends, find another way. Do not buy this album."
5,this video will make you wonder whether Elvis is alive,"This video was very interesting. Although, I have always laughed when people said Elvis Presley is still alive, this video left me wondering whether it could be possible!"
2,Non-reference Downfall,"Know your goals. If you expect to have mastered XHTML after this book, look elsewhere. As said by another reviewer all the details are not covered and one is referred to other sources, but it is a good place for beginners to start. You will have to visit online tutorials to complete this book and you'll still need to purchase a XHTML book that can be used as a reference.The author's expertise provides one with an excellent historical section, but I personally found it to be more on the side of information overload.XML related subjects are mentioned, but only seasoned HTML'ers will be able to comprehend the explanations, which I found too brief to really be enriching.For those with some HTML experience there are better books out there and one should continue their search for another XHTML book. Beginners will be will served with this book."
3,Could have been better,This book explains XHTML and how to convert from HTML very good but it just does not stack up as a reference. Since most people who buy books about web development and design need to use books as reference I would probably not suggest it. If you have a good understanding of HTML and you would like to learn XHTML and it's differences then I would definitely recommend this book. It also has a few chapters on xml and xsl.
2,Ultimate Human Body Software,I purchased this software for my daughter. This software is a bit outdated and has compatability issues with Windows XP. It works but not without some tweaking. I've seen better software produced a few years prior to when this product was released. It does offer some learning for children but very minimal. For how much potential it has it delivers very little.
3,UV bulb burned out after a week of use.,"Like another reviewer here said, you can't find replacement UV Bulbs for this model. It's a great Air Purifier otherwise. Works wonders in my bedroom. Keep the air nice and clean. My only regret with this model is the aforementioned UV bulb. With no way to get a replacement and countless google searches turning up nothing, I'm left with two choices:1. Return the unit to manufacturer and get an entirely new unit.2. Call Germ Guardian and see if I can't finagle a replacement bulb out of them.I've only had this product for a week and the UV bulb burned out. If it wasn't for that I'd have given this air purifier 5 stars."
3,No UV replacement bulb for the AC4000,There does not appear to be any UV ionizer replacement bulb for the AC4000 model. Only the filter is listed as a replacement part in the small brochure which came with the unit. Furthermore there is no listed model number of a UV replacement bulb which one might buy separately. Eventually the UV bulbs wear out and have to be replaced.
1,"Not very good, Don""t recommend","I bought 2 of these a few months ago from another site. The concept sounds ideal but, 1. They make noise that sounds like bad fan bearings or something is not right. 2. Running 24/7 there is no difference in air quality. 3. They do trap a little dust. 4. They circulate a very small amount of air, not use full in a room 10x10 it seems. 5. They have had no effect on allergies at all. And no reduction in dust on surfaces.I have had holmes and honeywell in the past and even a very old norelco. They were all quieter, circulated more air, made a noticeable fresher smell, and reduced dust particles on dresser, computer, tv etc. And helped with allergies. None of these qualities have been found with the germ guardian."
2,Unpleasant noise,"I purchased this a target and returned it. It has an unpleasant high pitched sound to it. I had purchased it for my daughters room, but she did not like the light emitted from it either. It is a nice small size."
2,too noisy,"bought while on stay-cation in a stinky condo. it did not work, and was WAY to noisy for the bedroom. or any room. if it had worked, we would have kept it for son's room. we returned it."
1,Germ Guardian tabletop air purifier,"Germ Guardian Tabletop Air PurifierI purchased this unit through Amazon from [...]. If you're looking for even a decent air purifier, PLEASE look elsewhere. Seriously, this product would be exceptional for a 2x2 closet! I got what I paid for ... a true disappointment and waste of money."
5,Some great guitar rock n' roll,"Have been wanting to buy this for sometime now.My question is, with new ""complete concert"" series.Will this ever be expanded to the complete show? Or is this the complete show?"
5,Delaney & Bonnie & Friends on Tour with Eric Clapton (Live),"Good Lord--this is the closest thing to spontaneous human combustion that may ever be captured on disc! Delaney's high-wire vocal acrobatics and hell-for-leather ""follow me!"" charges are absolutely inspiring, and Bonnie sings with enough vitality to rip down a brick wall with her bare hands. This also includes the raging fires that Eric tosses out, as well as the tornado whirlwinds fueled by Jim Gordon and Jim Keltner on drums, Carl Radle on bass, and Bobby Whitlock's keyboards. The horn section could blast down the walls of Jericho. This is an absolute must-have: throw away the vitamins and get this if you need an energy rush!!"
5,A Watershed album of the 60's and early 70's,"I had not spent much time following Eric Clapton until this album. Over the years it has remained in my top five list of rock and blues albums. I have had three copies of the record and all have been stolen. This album is great going down the road listening music. Southern Rock and Eric Clapton and great songs, a truly sleeper album."
3,"Great music, so so recording quality.","I'm always been a fan of Delaney & Bonnie. I must be to love them like I do without ever having any of their music that was recorded really well. I generally prefer studio recordings because the energy & spontaneity possible from live recordings usually (to me)just comes across as the band just jamming as fast and loud as they can which is a hoot if you're there, but is rarely captured in a recording.Truly gifted muscicans (such as E. Clapton & Bonnie B.) and vocalists (such as D. Bramlett)can really get it across more effectively when they can take their time to fully develop every note, tone & chord. These are capable of much more than I hear on this cd.That being said, if I lost my copy, I'd get another."
4,A good practical book,"I found this book to be very exciting. I have takenseveral calc courses. And after graduating I still did notunderstand how calculus fits in real life. This booksfocuses on just that. When ever I find time, Ieagerly read this book.. This book shows that mathsis not just number/formulae crunching but has more deepermeaning. Do not throw this book. You will discover its valueif you re-read.I read a couple of reviews noting that this is not a good book.Most of those bad reviews are from students who are currentlyusing this book as a school text book. I know it is frustratingif your goal is to get to the right answer in the shortestpossible time. This book makes you think, think-a-lot. Clearlycontrary to the expectations."
4,Fresh approach to a dry subject,"A calculus book that actually helps you *understand* the concepts; it isn't just endless repetition of alien instructions - although that does exist too, after all it is a mathbook. Would have given it a higher rating but, again, it is a mathbook."
1,Calc 1 with Houghes-Hallett,This is the poorest calculus book I have ever had to work with. It gives poor explanations of the subject matter and the examples it offers provide no insight into how to use the thereoms of the section. The question are often esoteric and confusing. I feel that I have become stupider for having used this textbook.
1,Horrid!!,"The book is a disaster. I had to suffer with it for 2 semesters. None of the other students in my Calc I and Calc II courses got anything from it either, as far as I can tell. I had to scramble and seek information from other calc books in order to understand what differentiation and integration was all about. The text in no way prepares one for the exercises. There's no connection between the text and the exercises. In the exercises there appear some inane, open-ended questions that seem to be trying to make some unfathomable point. This is not a book anyone can learn from. I would strongly advise any student who must use this book as their course textbook to CHANGE COLLEGES. There are many great calculus books out there, on all levels. For those who prefer a 'calculus reform' approach, I would recommend Calculus Lite, by Frank Morgan. For the more traditional approach, I got a lot out of Anton's classic."
1,This book is a stinker!,"Had to suffer through this book for undergraduate science background requirement. Also used the multivariable book by same authors for Calc2 requirement. Full of extremely poor explanations, expects you to jump from simple examples to complex problems. This would be fine if I was a Harvard math wiz like Deborah Hughes-Hallett. However, few of us are, so how about some better examples and explanations that a normal human being can follow. Also, try examples without skipping so many steps."
2,Absolutely irritating,"My College Calculus professor uses this book as a suppliment to provide examples for the class use. Everyone hates the problems as they are vague and lack any explanation on how to solve the problem or even where to begin. It appears to me that someone wrote a book simply to create problems that cannot be solved by the book's explanations. Calculus requires a working understanding of the ideas and concepts of the base math before an sort of obscure application should be used. I would not recommend this book to anyone, unless they already have a good understanding of calculus and wish to delve further into the application of the math to the real world. In that case, buy the book. For the other 95% that are just wanting to learn calculus; go buy a different book that teaches you something first."
1,What a terrible book,This book is horrible. The examples don't guide you for all of the problems and the explanations aren't very good either. The Student Solutions Manual doesn't have every odd answer.. and coincidentally the ones missing are the ones you can't understand!! Definitely don't recommend it.
1,Not a very good text.,"I used this book for a one-semester course and I did not gain a very good learning experience from it. The exercises did not coordinate with the examples and concepts that were presented. I had to use Anton's book to supplement this book. I feel that if I did not go to a different text I would not have gotten above a B in the course. I recommend buying Anton's 5th edition (it is out of print, but available from Amazon) or Stewart's text. Judging from how the book dealt with the material from Calc I, I can only assume that the rest of the material is as bad."
2,"A FEW strengths, but mostly weak coverage of the subject.","You know, I think the Calculus Reformers mean well, but they seem to be lost in mathematics dreamland, where everyone has time to read and absorb uninteresting abstractions.To be fair,the authors have good explainations on certain things, like bounds and continuity, unfortunately that was in the appendix, where they had the good sense for once to be brief! No, buy yourself a real calculus textbook, like the one by George F. Simmons, who will teach you what is really going on, providing examples and problems that are designed to teach, without being abominably boring like this book."
2,Poor textbook,"I strongly do not recommend this textbook. The book is difficult to follow because of the poor examples. In addition, a lot of the solutions to the odd numbered problems are not in the back of the book."
1,A waste of paper,"I used this text for Calc I & II college level courses and I was completely disappointed. The examples are very obscure and the approach is far too technical for first timers and experts alike. The solutions to the examples are very hard to trace. I.e. they jump from one part of the equation/problem to another and don't tell you how they got ther, which leaves you feeling uneasy. I think even Isaac Newton would have a hard time with this text. If you can, avoid taking a class that uses this book at all costs, and if you can't, make sure you have an excellent instructor."
2,It is difficult to follow,"The book very good problems to work on throughout the book. But, big but it has very poor explaination that asuume that you do have some previous knowledge of the subject. The examples they do in the book are often hard to follow because many steps are skipped in the solving equations"
1,Terrible,"This is an absolutely terrible textbook. Hardly any explanations in any of the sections for problem solving. And the homework problems rarely relate directly to the material in the preceding section. The student solutions manual has only every fifth problem and, not unexpected from the attitude of the authors, none of the difficult homework problems are among those that are solved anywhere."
1,This book sucks,"I had taken Calc I with this book, and now I am in Calc II and we are using this book. I was sitting here trying to read through the sections assigned and getting very agitated with the vagueness of this book. Since day one, I have hated this book. Instead of teaching you theories, concepts, and how to use the applications, recognize different patterns, their idea of teaching you is by giving a few examples for each section. The problem is that they skip 3 or 4 steps, and you have no idea how they arrived at a particular answer. Then, when you get to the homework problems, it is hard to do many of them because the examples are ... and do not relate often to the homework problems. Do not buy this book if you don't have to."
1,"Oftem confusing, strange irritating format","I am using this book for a calc II college course, after taking AP Calculus in high school. The book in high school was great, unfortunately this one is horrid. The examples are confusing, and the problems very vauge. I am going to get another book to get through this course, as this one is terrible."
1,awful awful awful,this textbook is very vague and not clear on the explanation of concepts. The preface says that the authors wished to create a book where students could not derive the answers to exercises from looking at worked out examples. Well golly how convenient. It seems to me it's just another lame brained excuse to hand out a worthless book. My advice don't waste your money purchasing this book. Instead go to a used bookstore and buy another calculus book.
1,"hoyabird, I agree. Harvard calculus ...","...P>I don't have a Ph.D. from Harvard either, but I should be getting one next year.I have had to teach an introductory calculus course at Harvard that follows the ""Harvard Calculus"" treatment that originated with this book (though the course did not use this book). It was awful. It is no easier to teach this course than it is to learn from it. Students need to learn calculus first *before* applying it to the various fields they will study."
5,A dissapointment,I expected more from this recording. Both singers are wonderful and sound great in other recordings. I think the quality of this recording is poor.
5,"The best ""Puppy"" book ever!","As pet shop owners, we are always asked our opinions about the various dog breeds we sell in our store. ""What will the puppy look like as it matures?"" ""Are there variations of the breed?"" ""How will this puppy interact with my other pets?"" ""I have heard of this breed, can you show me pictures of it (if we don't have that breed of puppy in our store)."" We use this book as a reference book for our customers and we also sell copies of it in our store. You will love the photographs and can use them as a representation of the particular breed when contemplating the purchase of a puppy from a breeder or a pet shop. Never, ever buy a puppy from a Seller over the Internet. You must see the puppy, hold it and play with it before finalizing your purchase. This book provides much of the information you will need in making this life affecting decision."
4,Simple & Sweet,"This book is wonderful for those who are into puppies in general. This is a great learning guide for children, or people of any age that can appreciate the playful innocence of young pups. This book as an informative reference falls somewhat short, but gives a decent overview of each breed. Each page has a generous amount of pictures of a specific breed of puppy, then a picture of the corresponding breed as an adult, which is nice. The photographs are well taken and the silly poses the puppies fall into will definitly draw a smile or laugh from any reader. It's undeniably adorable and a fun book to have on the shelf. Caution: this book will create an overwhelming desire to buy a dog! ;)"
4,Cute watch,....but the battery was dead when it arrived. Would have been nice if there was some quality-control to check for things like that before shipping.
2,Disappointing set,"I love the Dr Mabuse films from the 1960's and was thrilled when I saw that this was being released, at least until I opened the set and popped the disc in my player. The movies are all full-frame English dubbed TV prints and the quality is about what you would expect from cheapie Alpha Video releases of public domain movies. I can't believe Image would release such an inferior set and I will be very, very careful in the future and check reviews before ordering anything else that they release."
4,Pretty good disk after all,"What's not to like about The Dr. Mabuse Collection? The movies are fun, the transfers are decent, and the price is right. This is likely the best Region 1 DVD of these films we'll see for awhile, so better get it while you can!"
3,Fun Euro mysteries,This series is based on the films featuring the Crime genius Dr.Mabuse. The films appear edited but do deliver the flavor of 60s Euromovies. The actors are all well represented in these films.I got this set at a very low price and picked it up because I wanted to see the ones with Lex Barker. I saw all of them and enjoyed them all enough to be looking at the others and learning more about Mabuse.
4,Wow! A Pleasant Surprise,"Despite the contradictions of some of the songs with others on the CD, Ms. Mitchell has a pleasant voice and the tunes are generally well-produced and catchy.She's no Shania Twain, Faith Hill, or Martina McBride, but surely there's room in Nashville for more contributions from Ms. Mitchell. I look forward to hearing from her (and buying her next offering) in the not-to-distant future."
4,Catchy country music,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of music and Beverly Mitchell's singing talent! I took a chance, based on several reviews citing her ""warm tone"" and ""catchy music"", and now I am glad I did. Most of the 14 tracks are upbeat and on those, several are especially good. I find myself humming a few of the songs around the house now. The slow melodies aren't as fun to listen to because there is a nasal ""whine"" that is noticeable on a few of them. But there are only a few slow songs, so it's still worth it.If you need a comparison, I'd consider her singing similar to LeeAnn Womack on the more upbeat tracks. :-)"
4,Impressive first start,"Having watched Beverley Mitchell in 7th Heaven I admit she was not my most favorite character. I saw her sing first on a more recent episode of 7th Heaven when she sung to her baby. I was somewhat annoyed by the sound then I heard ""Heaven on Earth Down Here"" and I fell in love with the song. The rest of the CD is quite good and I think this is an impressive first run. I look forward to watching her grow as a Country artist."
4,great gift choice,"Great buy for the woman who has almost everything. great deal on a hard to find item, gee it's soo cooooool."
5,Does It So Well,"If anyone wondered if TV's ""7th Heaven"" star Beverley Mitchell can sing, she leaves no doubts with her first CD. With excellent vocals, good song choices, and an ability to go easily from a ballad to rockin', Beverley Mitchell can definitely sing country. From the inspiring ""Dream Like We're Gonna Live Forever"" to the kickin' ""Good Girls"", Mitchell shows her talent on 14 tracks and leaves the listener wanting more. An original talent doing original songs doing a very good performance."
3,Canned music.,"I love this girl and ehat she stands for. However this is California Country music, and i am so-so about it."
3,Easy Set Up; Looks Good; Needs to be Reset From Time to Time,The airport base station looks cool and was very easy to set up. It sends out a strong signal. The only downside is that from time to time it stops working and I need to unplug it and plug it back in again and then all is well. I have to do this once a week or once every two weeks. This is a weakness but I am still glad I have it.
4,Good Value but One Feature Missing,I purchased this older style Airport to use with our Wireless DSL Modem Router to make us independent of our service provider should we ever decide to change. It was fairly easy to set up but lacks one feature that I would like to have. That is to be able to attach a back-up drive to it (It can connect to a printer however). This was my fault due to not doing the research to make sure that the USB connection would support a hard drive. In any case the unit works fine and has a strong signal throughout the house.
2,Collectors item,"The product is still reliable and functional. Just understand that it is an edition of the Airport Extreme that was replaced by the newer white boxy looking 802.11N gigabit access point more than two years ago. I'm of the opinion that some of this old Apple stuff will has enduring value in it's very design. It's a router disguised as a Hershey Kiss!! Way cool, but way slow too. I've never even heard of two of it's standards, anyone know what WAP-EN or Fast-EN is? Hey, its probably fine for E-mail, and it is way cool! I'll give it another star. Now if they just made one in a funky seafoam color!"
3,Another good apple product... but still...,"This is a good product supporting the 802.11g standard (if patched supports the final spec) allows 54mbps at what I have found to be about 55 feet but is completely backwards compatible.PROS) 802.11g (NATIVE)) Native 802.11b support (part of the 802.11g spec)) A throughput of 54mbps at most. This is about one half of standard Ethernet. And approx 5x faster than standard 802.11b) My 802.11b computers seem slightly faster than before, but not a substantial amountCONS) 99% of PC users have a passionate hatred for Mac/Apple Products.) Only 1 LAN and 1 WAN (a.k.a. Uplink i.e.: to DSL/CABLE) ether net ports.) Requires a Mac for setup.It is more appropriate to mark this as 3.5 stars but you cant. Don't get me wrong it's a good product but not enough Ethernet support."
2,it's not only the good that die young,"My stock Toshiba battery lasted nearly 34 months. This ""new"" one lasted about 19 before I started experiencing unprompted shut-downs. I even treated the ""new"" one better, by letting it fully drain and charge. Nineteen months is still good, I guess, but it's a bit sad that it's got barely over half the life of the stock battery.Love the Toshiba Satellite laptop, though-- coming up on 5 good years with it."
4,Toshiba Battery,battery was not a Toshiba but fit and has worked well for the first three weeks. This was a good product for the money.
2,Disappointed.,"This battery sure charges quickly, but it also drains quickly. I have a Toshiba Satellite and it has lasted approximately 1.5 hours the most. My opinion? For the price I paid for, it's totally not worth it. You're probably better off trying a different or generic brand for half the price. Very disappointed with this Toshiba battery."
1,Battery did not charge,Battery was able to turn the computer on but it did not charge. I have been dealing with INKTONERSTORE for over a month...After the first two weeks I gave up and sent the battery back to TOSHIBA...The item was delivered at Toshiba 2 weeks ago and I still have no resolution...I am very disappointed and I hope that Amazon will help me out to get this resolve ASAP...Still waiting for a battery since DEC 1st.
1,not happy,"I'm sure it is not ""the norm"" but this battery is NOT working...it won't charge at all and I am going to call tomorrow to return it."
2,"Everything was working perfect, but after 3 days of using the battery, started to run out of energy after few minutes of use","Everything was working perfect, but after 3 days of using the battery, started to run out of energy after few minutes of use, I followed the instructions, I am very dissapointing"
4,Installed and working,This toshiba battery is installed and working as spected but only the time will say if its a good product.
3,A battery that does what it's suppose do.,"Perhaps it better to do a review after a few months or even a year or two after I have been using this battery for a more accurate review.I don't think it's quite fair to review it only weeks after, however, based on the performance of the battery thus far I would say it's doing it's job.I will [hopefully] try to do a follow up in due time. Nonetheless, the only slight draw-back at this time is $75 odd price, otherwise, it's a decent battery."
2,didn't work well,"battery life is very short!they said they would send me a replacement, but I never received it!"
1,Not the right battery despite its description,I purchased this battery after triple checking that it was for my computer model. It wasn't and I was stuck with paying to have it replaced. It is better to eat the higher price and go through the vendor (Toshiba's) website. It will save you money and aggravation in the end.
1,Battery quality,"The battery would never take a proper charge for a new battery. Full charge would take over 20+ hours. I even properly charged and discharged the battery three times as recommended. After a visit for technical service on the issue, the tech (at a private repair service) said, ""... your problem is the replacement battery... get a battery directly from the laptop manufacturer..."". I did so and it performed a 100% to my satisfaction. The defective vendor made a return of the battery for credit to my credit card, but that still cost me time out of service, technician expense and lost shipping charges both ways. My suggestion on laptop batteries is... get them directly from the manufacture."
3,ok I guess,"OK, but it only lasted 2 1/2 hrs before needing charged. The original Toshiba battery lasted up to 8 hrs."
5,42nd Street-Australian style,I have all the 42ND STREET FOREVER series of DVDs. I go ape over trailer DVDs & documentaries of low budget films. This DVD fils the bill perfectly.
1,Don't even think about it!,What were they thinking? Don't you even think about it! Unquestionable the worst documentary I have ever seen!
1,Can't believe I paid for this.,"My mother always taught me if you can't say something nice don't say anything at all, and that is what I'm going to do with this steaming pile of garbage."
1,Terrible quality and filmmaking...,"My gosh. This has to be one of the worst films I've seen from a technical quality aspect. From start to finish the camera is totally out of focus...and so are the so-called actors/actresses. There is nothing worth watching here. It is so-o-o-o bad. The dead and mutilated bodies are real people. Know why? You can see them breathing after they've been brutally murdered. The script could have been written by a hip-hop loser. Every other word out of EVERY actor-actress is fu...! Closely followed by sh...! The box claims that this film was the winner of the 2008 Fright Night Film Festival. If this was the winner, I'd hate to see the losers. Don't waste your time... the only ""fright"" in this film is that there are stupid people like me that actually spent money on this...$1.99 to be exact...and that, too, was a complete rip-off."
1,More like a Piece Of Crap,"All the elements of a crappy movie are here (and there are far too many of them these days in this genre) - crappy story, crappy acting, crappy production, i.e. sound, lighting. Bogus ""winner"" of some (most likely) made up ""film festival"" Not scary. Not titillating. Not interesting. Not worth your time."
3,An Inspiration To Draw and Inspire,"I was inspired to draw by this book. I saw in it three generations of portraits, many truthful youthful moments. One of the subjects, a child, says: ""I wish I could draw like you when I am older"". His comment and respect for Jean Reasoner is so true, and so honest, that is the very essence that is inspiring me to draw, even though I am now 40. I started two years back when I finished my first drawing for a girl I loved, who happened to just get married eight years earlier than I have the ability to put down my feelings for her on pencil and paper. I can do beautiful eyes, I don't know perspectives, but I believe I can draw as good as what I have seen in Jean's book.Stephen Cheng Hong Kong"
3,Not Recommended,"Despite the promising title,Crosby tends to propose dismantling Religious Life, where it becomes anything and everything, which would, of course, make it anything but prophetic."
2,Patchy but mostly second-rate Sparks effort,"Perhaps it's a generational thing, but to me Angst in My Pants doesn't have quite the immediacy of the 1970s Sparks classics. There are certainly some listenable tracks: Moustache is a fun, real-Sparks song with a degree of gusto. Sextown USA has some of Sparks classic manic musical doodles. And I Predict has a certain power. But Instant Weightloss and Tarzan & Jane seem pretty feeble, albeit (as other reviewers have pointed out) very much in the 1980s mould. If that's your thing you might like the whole album.Overall a second rank Sparks album albeit not a total flop."
1,A review that cost $5.95,"This digital download is merely a REVIEW of Pamela L. Poulin's translation of J.S. Bach's book on Precepts and Principles for Playing the Thoroughbass. We feel ripped off by having paid $5.95 for a short book review. Buyer, be forewarned."
5,Do yourself a favor and buy this book!,"After reading some of Emmett's articles in Windows NT Systems magazine, I decided to buy this book. I'm glad I did. Emmett's style lends itself to easy reading and fast learning and review for the exam. Don't waste your money on an expensive ""novel"". If you know a little bit about TCP/IP and want a supplement to cover the areas you need to know for the exam, then buy this book and get the TCP/IP exam behind you!!!"
5,Its the Best Grill for the money!,"The Weber was top rated by a consumer testing firm and they are right.It cooks great, has lots of power and can also cook at low temps.I owned my last Weber for over 15 years and love this new one.You can spend less and get lower quality and more for a bigger grill; but this grill looks great, cooks great and is big enough for most peoples needs.We have had this grill for over three years and still like it."
3,fatal flaw,"I have always been a Weber grill fan whether it be propane or charcoal. Had to replace my previous one after about 15 years of great service and bought a Genesis. No issues with the way it cooks = however, an extremely annoying problem emerged after it was exposed to rain a few times - water somehow drains into the drip pan which eventually overflows inside the cabinet and ultimately onto the patio carrying all the grease with it. Would not buy another because of this problem. Also, the igniter is pretty flimsy, wore out very quickly and had to be replaced within 6 months."
3,Shipping damage,"Great grill, cooks well, however...1)Box arrived with exterior damage. The grill has a gash in the stainless steel lid. Now every time I cook I get to contemplate what CEVA trucking could have stabbed through the box. Weber could also do a better job of packaging so that the most visible part of the grill is not the front bumper for this type of abuse. If the package arrives in damaged condition don't accept it.2) Weber decided to put the in the clevis pins holding the lid to the oven with out the securing clips. The result is disastrous. One pin fell out during shipping. When the lid is opened it twists side ways and drops over the back, bending the sole pin 90 degrees. If this had broken the pot metal hinge on the oven it would be the end of the line for Weber S-3203) Don't undertake assembly unless you get a true sense of accomplishment from that sort of ordeal. Took about four hours. Get and electric screwdriver and a socket wrench.Good Luck!"
5,THE BEST DRILL EVER MADE!,"I bought this drill for my husband and it is great. He has worn out every other drill that he has used such as snap on, 12v porter cable, and several other drills but this one stands up to the test. I am hoping this will be the last one i will ever buy and so far i have nothing but praise for it. The batteries last forever and its great that it comes with two so there is no waiting. This drill is also a great price. I shopped around and this is by far the best deal. I just cant say enough about this drill. I hope this was helpful in making your purchase."
5,IT WORKS!,Our office has used this same scanner for at least 8 years. I was happy to find an identical scanner that we already had. We can not afford to update workstations so the Windows XP software was happy to have the replacement as well. Hopefully we'll recover in this sagging economy and eventually update everything!
1,Do not waste your money.,I am already on my second Visoneer scanner in one month. The customer service and tech support are terrible.
2,Make Sure Laserfcihe is included,I undertstand that this is a fine scanner if you can get the right software. What I found is that this version from Amazon does not include the Lasefiche software. I sent the first one back and received a second one - still without the Laserfiche software. Amazon needs to change this ad to reflect that they do not send Laserfiche software with the scanner.
1,Missing software,"Amazon should hold its vendors to a higher standard. This product was sold explicitly including specific software, the vendor refused to ship the agreed upon product and was difficult in providing the product.I would not purchase from Amazon again due to their lack of support."
2,Good when it works,"I've owned two predecessors to this scanner - but they are about the same. The ADF on the first gave up during the warranty period and Visioneer replaced it. The second one (the whole scaner)gave up about a year outside the warranty period, so it's a goner. It's a fairly servicable scanner for the price (when it works), although it really only allows you to feed about 5 to 7 documents at a time. I like the Paperport software. Although there is better OCR software available, the Paperport is versatile, easy to use, and generally gets the job done."
1,don't buy this if you have window 7. OK for window XP,"If you have window 7, this scanner doesn't work. I worked for a university and I have a very experienced IT technican to install this for me, and still have problem getting it to work. My IT tech called the visioneer technician many times; went through a whole 3 weeks of trying different corrections like download a file to try to make it work; pay $10 for a disk for window 7; 1st CD was a lemon; received the 2nd CD and installed it and still didn't work. Finally we gave up and hooked it up to a computer with window XP, then it has no problem. Bottom line is they shouldn't advertise that it will work with window 7 when it wasn't made for that."
3,Good for small guns,"This gun bag is alright, but i wouldnt recommend this if u have a big gun like a m4 or ak unless u plan to take it apart and then put it together again . This bag barely fits my p90 so overall unless u got a pretty small AEG or just want to use it to store pistols then this is the right product for u."
4,Sweet Soul,"Donny Hathaway is best known to most for his duets with Roberta Flack. Those songs are great, but Mr. Hathaway has released some great soul music on his own. Everything Is Everything is an album about love and positivity, but also cautiousness and struggle. Love songs include the sweet ""Je Vous Aime"" & ""Misty"" while ""To Young, Gifted & Black"" & ""Thank You Master (For My Soul)"" are teeming with pride. He tempers the positivity with cautionary tales such as ""Tryin' Times"", ""Voices Inside (Everything Is Everything)"" and the classic ""The Ghetto"". Mr. Hathaway left us at too young of an age, but he lives on forever in his sweet soul music."
5,I Hear Voices......,"Anything by the late Donny Hathaway is highly reccomended, and this 1970 LP is among his best. The title track is a timeless, funky tune and starts things off in fine fashion. ""Thank You Master (For My Soul)"" is straight gospel but without the annoying histrionics that mar most spiritual-tinged music. This album is a fine example of Hathaway's restless, eclectic spirit as no 2 songs sound the same, but they all cohere into a very strong and moving whole. A Brilliant LP, by a brilliant and sorely missed musical genius."
5,Incredible!,"Donny Hathaway was an amazing talent. This is my favorite album by him, and I own and love all of his albums. Absolute brilliance from a musical genius. If you love soulful music, you should not be caught without this recording in your collection. Calling this album a ""masterpiece"" would not suffice to summarize its greatness!"
4,He Put Everything into his work,Donny Hathaway was a Musical Genius and true SoulMan.The Power of His voice&Music made you take Notice.this disc is Good&Solid.The Ghetto is timeless.You Here the truth in his voice.this is what Soul Music used to Be.
2,"Seemingly good price, but...","Seemingly good price, but so badly warped that it wouldn't fit in the slot under the countertop."
3,Solid book with interesting delivery,"I enjoyed the way Brand Gap was written. It is a quick read with some insightful information. Two week after finishing it I'm not left with any earth shattering revelations about marketing, but it did make me think about things a little differently. A solid bathroom read. Good format for it."
3,Intro to Branding 101 - Basic but boring,"A quick, high level and easy-to-read intro to branding. This book seems targeted to people who are interested in a high-level, general view of brand theory and brand strategy. It gives a few main ideas on the meaning of a brand, different ways to manage a brand and how to maintain your brand. It makes a few big points but doesn't provide any sort of justification or research into why you should believe their view of branding. Many pages have less than 10 words, but make a bold and simple point. However, the book fails to live up to its name of ""The Brand Gap"" and doesn't give any suggestions on how to bridge itRecommendation: Borrow from your library or download the free PDF presentation, which covers 90% of the content of the book at [...]"
2,Mixed...,"This book feels a wee bit dated (it's been a couple of years since I've read the phrase ""World Wide Web). It seems to dance all over the place, and did not offer any particularly unique ideas. Feels like it's cheating a bit with the big text.It might be of interest to individuals who want a good overview of branding. May be too simplistic for individuals in the marketing, advertising, or design."
5,Why does it matter?,"`That's the question that both haunts me and excites me.I saw this book while presenting at a publisher's conference and was intrigued. I perused it and was hooked. I bought it and was convicted and entertained.Marty Neumeier has provided a concise and amazingly simple analysis of the how and the why of branding. He explains how a company can both clarify their message and create a unified brand from both business model and strategy through design.I spent the other day on a plane underlying key sections and then getting copies for my advisory board. Now we start to answer the key questions he poses.1) Who are we?2) What do we do?3) Why does it matter?I'm simple and impatient. The Brand Gap is straight-forward yet profound, brief yet thorough; right up my alley. Get it, you'll be glad you did."
2,For begginers,"A good book if you are beggining in Marketing, but nothing new for experienced marketeers. Is easy to read, with the same old broadly used to explain almost everything examples (IPOD and others)."
3,This book has some gaps,"The book is really a skim on branding... brightly colored it is.. a what's missing in branding, it isn't"
1,The Brand Gap,"For anyone in the business of branding, marketing or advertising, don't waste your money on this one. The book is nothing more than fluff, with no substance or insight. A definite zero."
3,Not what I expected,Brand Gap is a great overview book of Branding but misses the mark in regards to having real implement now application. If this had been the first book I read about Branding then it would have been perfect but after reading other more specific books It was a let down.The positive of the book was that it really drove home that Branding is not what we say about who we are but what others say about us.
5,Brand Gap - A most readable short course,"I am completely enamoured with the style and content of Neumeier's new book and am recommending it to all of my clients! Having worked in the flavor and fragrance industry for my entire career I find this to be the perfect vehicle to explain one of the most powerful aspects of flavor and fragrance application in consumer products, packaging, and advertising - multi-dimensional and multi-sensory brand building! Neumeier's treatise is just too short not be read and enjoyed and applied to modern consumer product development and management! Trout and Ries; and now Neumeier to add meaning to it all! YEE haw!"
4,"Very good, easy to read guide",Very interesting book that goes straight to the point. It gives you easy steps to follow and has a very good summary and glossary of brand terms.
4,Beyond Trout and Ries,"The Brand Gap picks up where Trout and Ries leave off. It gets into areas that traditional marketing and positioning books fear to tread, namely the role of aesthetics in building brands. As a 30-year veteran of Madison Avenue, I've learned the hard way that it doesn't matter how great your strategy is---it's execution PLUS strategy that moves products. Neumeier is one of the first to recognize this simple but elusive truth. It's enough to give one hope for the future of the marketing business. For that matter, for the future of business. Period."
3,It's sharp!,"A great little saw. Have used it a lot and find it is keeping it's edge well, even though I've been cutting oak, ply, glue, etc., etc.My big problem with it (and the only reason it doesn't get five stars from me) is that the handle does tend to pull off - which is a serious issue on a back saw like this. I've no doubt I'll figure out some way of preventing this (maybe fine sandpaper on lower part of the blade? maybe make another handle?), but the handle design itself should be better.Still, its a good, sharp blade and I think worth the $$$."
1,AWFUL.,"No matter how little force you use, the blade keeps sliding off. It is a flawed design--the blade does not hook around anything in the handle."
5,Great saw and good value,"I've used this saw to flush cut dowel rods after making furniture repairs. It's excellent for that task. The blade is made of good Japanese steel and it is sharp. It's nice, too, that the blade is replaceable. All in all, this is a good tool and a good value."
1,Bootleg!,"Buyer beware! This album is a bootleg. The BBC portion was recorded by holding a mic up to the radio, and the taper shut the recorder off between songs. Awful sound (and I collect bootlegs, so if I say it's bad, believe me)."
5,Airport Extreme Card,The card works better than expected. It was easy to install when you read the instructions and tips available on-line. The through-put was the same as directly connected to the router via CAT-5.
5,flying high,since i urchased this card it made my life easier. This cards picks up all hotspots no matter where i go. My Apple ibook G4 now runs better. and does not hold back any signal losses
5,Awesome!,I bought this more than 2 years ago and installed it in my eMac and it still works just great. I was so happy when I found this because I looked everywhere and no Apple store sells this anymore and if they did it would cost at least $100
4,good,product works fine. no problems. very satisified no problems to report. loaded quickly. will purchase from this vendor again. thanks
1,Extreme Card,I bought an Extreme Card for my G4 from ameris and it was faultydidn't load and wouldn't let the computer come on. Sent a note on the feedback and didn't get any response. Looks like I will have to eat the card and the cost. Not very happy with the vendor that amazon let sell the product on their site.
1,Do not work with non-Apple access points!,"Does not work with non-Apple base stations! I had a PowerMac G5. I was told by Apple retail store clerks it will work any wireless G access points. But No! At my house my PC can see no less than 6 wireless AP's (some from neighbors, one mine). But this Airport card can only see one (which is an Apple Airport Station)! Tried everything ( Googled, set encryption modes, slow downed my LinkSys WAP tranfering bitrate to 2Mbps etc...) and no luck. Returning it tomorrow."
4,Thank you for the great service,Thanks to J&R Music and Computer for good response and followup on a rush order. I would shop here again and plan to soon. This is an unsolicited review.TjM
5,AirPort (G series adapter) or PowerPC's and laptoms,Wonderful AirPort adapter if it works with your particular machine for G series WiFi systems
5,Great wireless technology!,"This was very easily installed into my imac computer, adding wireless internet capability making my life easier. Apple makes the best products and is far ahead of the competition, in my experience. I still own earlier Apple computers and they've worked consistently better than any made by other companies - remaining very functional and are worth upgrading. It may be an ""older"" Apple Airport Extreme Card, but the quality and functionality are cutting edge to this day. Worth every penny spent."
3,Apple M8881LL/A AirPort Extreme Card,The Airport Extreme Card was fine. Not sure why it didn't work a good distance from the Network module. Other computers do work from that distance but we just moved our Macintosh G5 closer and the problem was solved. Great that we could get online that way.
5,Apple is Simply Better!,"The whole Apple Sytem is so easy to use, the Extreme Airport card is so Easy to install and there is No headache like I used to have with my PC's (I switched 3 years ago). Very hard to crash an Apple system. Apple was first with the Airport system. No need for the big ""C"" wireless.Works perfect in ""hot spot"" areas! Can't ask for a better system. Give Apple a try and you will see what I mean."
1,Incompatiblr,Incompatible with my iBook; Apple has such a phobia against providing 'System Requiremts' for their accessories; finally found the list on a vendors website. Amazon did not have this list. One has to do major resarch to find the info Apple won't provide ! !
5,Awesome!,"Apple Extreme card makes our iMac connect to our wireless home network seamlessly. In fact, the iMac connects to the other 2 Windows-based PC's better than they connect to each other. Way to go, Apple!"
4,beginners guide to Ninpo,"I read the book. It was not what I thought it would be. I read many books on the art before written by Stephen K. Hayes as well as Hatsumi Masaki. They were all about the technique, the physical side. I really was looking for a book that taught me more of that.After reading this books I realized that the author wrote this for the student that is already in a school. It was geared toward someone who was interested in all the things mentally and spiritually that goes along with the art. Although it has a great interview with Grandmaster Shoto Tanemura and has different chapters on the history and protocol. I was delighted to find things on goal setting, dealing with injuries as well as coping with burnout. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be motivated. Most of all I recommend it to the serious Ninpo enthusiast and beginner alike.Thanks.W. Remington"
2,"Interesting, but what are you looking for?","Well, I bought this book looking for research on whether I wanted to learn Ninpo or not, but the book is mostly motivation. Don't get me wrong--the book is enjoyable, but it lacks in Ninpo content. I WARN YOU: If you cannot stand typos, do not get this book. It has typos left and right, just like my review.) ;)"
5,A Must Have For Any Serious Martial Artist,"This is a great book for all martial artists, not just Ninpo practitioners. Renshi Alberigo talks about Martial Arts traditions, proper protocall, how to avoid burn out, and the warrior attitude. There are many valuable lessons in this book. Whatever style of Martial Arts you practice you can use the concepts and philosophies in this book to enhance your training and become the best Martial Artist you can be!"
2,Be careful,"I recently received the 7pc King Size Rose Finish Jacquard Comforter Bed in a Bag Set. Everything looked very nice and all 7 pieces were there.However, don't dry the pillows. I followed the directions on the tag of each item on how to properly wash and dry them. When I took the pillows out of my dryer they looked as if they had been ripped open on one side of each pillow. Stuffing was coming out everywhere. I have no idea how I'm going to sew them back together or if it's even possible. Once again let me stress how important it is not to dry the pillows. The instructions will tell you it is okay but it isn't."
2,mediocre oldies with a couple of exceptions,I bought this only for 'Spooky' by Classics IV which is a great song. The only other song I like on this double cd is 'Bus Stop' by The Hollies.
4,First Alert Carbon Monoxide,I hope to never put it to the real test but the tester button is very loud. It seems to do the job fine.
4,I am resigned to mandatory planned obsolescence.,I guess all CO alarms are programmed expire after 7 years. First Alert is a bit more up front about it than the competition. I wish we could just replace part of these units rather than the whole thing.
5,necessary purchase,Own one myself and decided to buy one for each of my children's homes as it is now a Calif. law.
5,Consumer Reports Recommended,Great price and highly recommened by Consumer Reports. Easier to find on line and have it mailed home instead of running around to different stores looking for it and a good price.
4,Perfect,My Refi company required this and I selected the brand and model after consulting several consumer advice sites. They were right. It seems to be well built and meets all of my expectations and requirements. I'd definitely by this again if I were to need it.
1,Pathetic,"Item arrived in very unfriendly packaging, and failed to function. (Invoking the TEST function yielded no audible sound. What a useful alarm!)"
1,No way to tell if it's really working,This product is kind of a waste. You have no way to tell if it's actually working. There is a button on it to see the last reading or highest reading but it always says 0 for me. I have limited faith in whether this is actually working.. I would Not recommend.
1,Dean,Tested it by putting behind my vehicle's muffler while my car was running. Tested all 4 I bought and only 1 of the 4 I bought went off. I tried test it a second time a few hours later and 2nd time none of them went off with no reading. I returned it to Amazon and bought the Kidde KN-COPP-B-LS 900-0230 tested the 3 I bought with same method and all past with flying colors.
3,Russell Starner,After the purchase I didn't realize that the best place for the unit in up high. Unfortuately where I live now won't allow many things to be hanging on the walls. The biggest drawback to the unit is the cord that is used to plug the unit into the wall. I do like the battery backup feature. I got the unit for safty purposes. I had no reason to test the unit yet. I hope that I didn't waste money by buying the unit.
1,Poor product,"After inserting the batteries, the battery door would not close. It will be difficult to trust this product to save your life. Based on another reviews, this company should be ashamed of itself."
1,End of the line,"My last purchase at amazon.com. I bought two alarms. One worked, one did not. Alarm horn did not sound. Had a previous problem buying a blood pressure machine, grotesquely misdescribed on the website. I have heard that Amazon has a no-return policy. Really does not matter. My time is too valuable to pack, address and go to the post office. Bye Amazon. Bye First Alert."
5,CO detector,Item arrive in a timely manner. tested with test button to see if alarm works-it did. If the product does not work in detecting CO after this installation I will not be able to write a review that it did not work. Just a bit of humor by a former chemist.
2,my batteries boiled over 5 minutes after I 1st plugged it in,Hopefully mine was a rare lemon but the batteries boiled over right after I plugged it in. I double checked to make sure that they were installed properly so that was not the problem. Amazon took back the unit and refunded my money but I did not buy a replacement. Most of the reviews seem positive so I hope this was a rare occurrence but I'm not taking the chance again. I'll go with a different unit.
4,Time Will Tell if a Good Value,"Purchased three (3) of the First Alert CO615 Carbon Monoxide units. Units were packaged well and were delivered promptly.All units were delivered with all items described, including the batteries.Assembly and installation was straightforward, per the instructions.While the ""test"" button does permit one to determine if the alarm sounds, it does not ""test"" if the unit is capable of correctly detecting carbon monoxide. Also, there is no apparent method to calibrate the unit."
4,First Alert Carbon Monoxide sensor #00615,"Item was just as described. Easy to set up, test button worked, sensor is not bad looking. Can't test reliabilty of its detection sensitivity, so this is always a question. First Alert has a good reputation so I have to rely on that, and hope that a problem never arises.I would buy again and would recommend it to others."
1,First Alert CO alarm NO / Kidde CO alarm YES,"This FIRST ALERT CO alarm (and presumably others by the same maker)DOES NOT register readings under 30ppm, in terms of the digital highest readings shown.It simply ignores them ....even though that might have shown a potential CO problem brewing.And you don't discover this point until you read the instructions.HOWEVER- the KIDDE CO Alarms DO measure peak readings below 30ppm...which is why I consider Kidde CO alarms to be a much better buy.I have both...and I am sorry that I purchased the First Alert CO alarm."
1,Alarm didn't work,"I had to return this product because the alarm didn't work. I held down the test/silence button, but no sound was made."
3,Shipped with 2 AA batteries rather a 9V battery as said in the technical specification,"Its been only 3 days since I have started using this product. So, I do not intend to review the product at this time. However, the product was shipped with 2 AA batteries rather a 9V battery as noted in the technical details section."
3,monoxcide detector,"Easy to use, however, instructions not clear as to insertion of back up battery, and I had to make a phone call to get the answer. But the cost is excellent."
1,What The Gas Co. said....,"I bought this plug in first alert cm detector. The Gas Co rep told me that it only detects at 70ppm, which means I'd likely already have headaches and be vomiting. He recommended I throw it out and buy a cm detector that detects at 400ppm. Also, he said socket plug ins are not effective as most sockets are low on the wall. The best kind is a battery operated detector (400ppm) that is placed within 2 ft of the ceiling. The idea is to be notified before you/family gets headaches and start vomiting."
3,It's okay,I guess it will work. The test beep sure is loud. I wonder if the product will work if there is a gas leak.
3,CO alarm,"Hope it's working.Plugged it in and forgot it. Meets Ohio new construction building code for hardwired specification.We had a recent MURDER via CO poisoning. See Dateline ""Wangler"".Be safe!"
3,Cheap battery compartment,"Bought this unit for the upstairs figuring the LCD display would act as a night light. It doesn't stay lit unless it senses CO or you press the display button. The battery compartment door is very cheaply made and you have to be careful that you don't break it when installing the battery. Unless you think you need the display, you would be better off purchasing the next version down from this one since the LCD screen is the only difference. Since they all are suppose to do the same thing I wouldn't buy the other brands that are more expensive, since they all seem to be made pretty cheap."
3,"Does the job, I think","It is hard to get ecited about a CO detector, but ust owning them helps me sleep well at night."
5,Easy setup (and great gift!),"Easy setup -- don't have to drill any holes in the wall or get up on a ladder to install it. This makes it a great gift for the grandparents or anyone older, especially if they live in a state (like CA) that requires CO detectors. All they have to do is plug it in and put in on a shelf.Cannot vouch for its ability to detect CO, other than it doesn't give false positives (don't use fireplace or gas appliances, have detached garage)."
4,Amazon was great to work with,This was well-rated by a consumers oraganization and we got them for our home. One was defective and Amazon quickly replaced it. They sent me a new one faster than I could mail the defective one back to them (no cost to me). Thanks Amazon. You deserve 5 stars.
5,Options in placement,"I was pleased to discover that the box can be instantly mounted by simply plugging it into an electric outlet, or the electric cord held inside the box can be unwound and the alarm mounted away from an electric outlet. The alarm seems sufficiently loud to wake just about anyone (except my teenage sons who could sleep through an atomic blast)."
4,Good Product,"Bought this to replace a Nighthawk CO2 Detector. First Alert has a good reputation, it uses AA batteries unlike the 9 volt in our previous model, ( batteries included with this purchase, which I liked) and it is not as big and bulky as our previous Detector. Soft Green light illuminates it. VERY easy to set up/install. I would certainly recommend."
4,Carbon Monoxide detector,"I really can't comment on this product because I don't know enough about these detectors to give an accurate review. Plus, I have nothing to compare it to. This is a first for me, and hopefully it works as stated in the literature. So I give it a 4 since I love that it plugs into the wall."
4,It Does The Job,"It's been in operation for several months without a glitch; I assume that it's working and as such, it does the job."
3,Randomly displays 92-122 PPM but alarm doesn't sound.,CO should be displayed without needing to press a button. We found after a week of use that this would display 92-122PPM with no alarm. The next day might display 0. Pushing the test button gets the alarm firing. If the unit is not defective we believe it has something to do with an attached garage. This thing is plugged in about 6 feet away from the garage entry door. Its possible that after the car is started and we get done closing all the doors that some drifts in and the alarm sounds for awhile. We might not be home to hear it. That is my only thought on the topic.
3,So so.,"Purchased this as a replacement carbon monoxide monitor. It is ""Made in China"". Biggest flaw I have noticed thus far is that the back up battery compartment door has a very flimsy, cheap plastic latch to it, which I am quite sure willbreak. However when it does break, I am sure a piece of Scothc tape will keep the dorr closed. I have had a different model in the past, and prefer the other model over this one. This is the one I prefer and would recommend: Kidde KN-COPP-3 Nighthawk Plug-In Carbon Monoxide Alarm with Battery Backup and Digital Display"
2,"Does Not Show Current CO Levels, Only Peak CO on Request","This product was not what I expected. There is a digital display on the unit, but the display is always off. The right hand button is to display ""Peak Level"" not current level of CO. The CO Memory automatically resets itself back to zero every 24 hours. I wanted to get a unit to monitor current CO levels in the room, a number displayed constantly and hands free.Very tempted to send this back. While it probably works well, it is not what I expected.On the plus side the unit plugs into a wall socket or the power adapter comes free from the unit and allows a remote installation.And like other reviewers have noted the owners manual is a joke."
4,Great service,We are very happy with the product so far and we saved a considerable amout going through Amazon. Delivery time was great. Delivered as promised and possibly sooner. Would recommend to any one.
4,Prompt Service and Good Product,"This is a carbon monoxide detector with a battery back-up and a digital read. A friend of mine had a carbon monoxide alarm go off and the response team told her to get a new one that would be better and this one has the features that they recommended. So, I feel safer with this even though we have a new furnace."
2,Junky,"Poorly constructed. The test and last high reading buttons hardly ever work. I had 2 Kidde Nighthawks that detected a bad oven with a reading of 14ppm. One in the kitchen and one in the basement, Yet the First Alert read 000. Kidde has excellent warranty service and outstanding customer service."
4,First Alert CO615 Carbon Monoxide Plug-In Alarm with Battery Backup,"I had to read the instructions to find out that you can't just press the TEST/SILENCE or CO READING button, you had to press and HOLD the button to receive the desired action. Once I learned this simple trick the device works very well. I've only had it installed for about a week but so far I'm happy.You have to just trust that the standard CO/SMOKE detector installed in your home is working correctly. You can never truly determine whether an alarm is ""real"" or a ""faulty"" detector. I had a faulty detector in the basement furnace room and it took two days to prove that the alarm I occasionally received was a false alarm. In the mean time the wife and dogs were running around ""wild eyed"" at intermittent times. I have since replaced the faulty detector and all is quiet and calm again.I recommend this detector to anyone in need of an alarm or just testing their existing alarms."
5,Can this be your life saver?,"This is my second purchase of this product, the first having reached the end of it's lifespan. But before that happened, the first one woke us up in the middle of the night when the furnace exhaust pipe unexpectedly collapsed, and undoubtedly saved our lives. Just follow the simple in-package installation directions, and let this little wonder be your guardian angel. We sleep better knowing it is on the job."
5,like it,"It is hard to know whether it is working perfectly. However, I have plugged in the wall I see a green light ON."
3,Looks like it is working,I wont know for sure if it works unless we have issues so I have to assume it is working. it looks like it works.
3,Works but I think I got a repackaged one,"I just plugged it in and it works. However, I am disappointed in the fact that the item had visual scuff marks and a letter or 2 had been rubbed off on the verbiage on the unit. Makes be believe that this unit is NOT new but I purchased as new."
4,Good product,"Works good so far, has a screen that shows the levels if any are present...You just plug it in to an outlet near a bedroom so you can hear it in case it goes off. Has battery back-up in case of power failure..Everyone should have a co detector in their home..."
5,Easy to install and good value,"Took only a minute to install and tests perfectly, without a hitch. I bought 6 of these, for my house and rental properties I own. This is superior to combined smoke/carbon monoxide detectors since carbon monoxide comes from the floor of the room, not the top."
4,Good so far,Very fast shipping and easy to set up. My only complaint is there should be a chart to tell you what levels are high and lo and level should constantly display
5,Your Life is Worth it,We have a hard wired Carbon Monoxide unit connected with our security system. Our electrician sujested we should also get this unit for infront of each bedroom. We had him wire in an outlets and we feel much better. It does not take long time for carbon monoxide fumes to effect your thinking. Small price for a childs life or even your own.
4,Works well so far....,I have had this item for about one month. I decided on this model due to reviews and consumer reports. The device is easy to use and test . I like the digital reading.
4,I am pleased with this unit!,"I like this product because: a). It is attractive and compact. b). It is available for use as a plug-in to any wall socket and/or has an available wall socket (extension) cord should the user care to install it in another location. c). It has a loud identifying alarm sound if and when needed. d). This product has been use in my home for the past 60 days, been operating perfectly with no apparent probelms. e). I have installed two of these alarms; one in my homes main floor bedroom and one in my basement family room that I am perfectly satisfied with."
2,I'm not even sure it's workng,"It does NOT constantly display the CO level in the room as the article states. The only thing that makes me think it's even working is the power light, which is not very bright. I gave this a rating of 2 stars because the main reason I bought this model was because the article says that it displays the CO level all of the time. It doesn't so what use is it? Will it work in an emergency? I don't really know."
4,Just what I wanted,Working great so far. Replaced a Kidde alarm because it was acting up. I like the plug rotation feature in the back which enable you to plug it into a horizontal or vertical outlet.
4,very easy to setup. great value.,very easy to install. i like the battery backup feature. the rotating feature seems like it would be useful too.
4,Carbon monoxide review.,"I feel much safer with a couple of these in the house, along with several smoke alarms.I think it is a good value."
2,poor construction,"The battery compartment opens from the front, which is convenient, but the lid did not close properly. Also the batteries had to be positioned just right to work, and it took a good several minutes of fiddling to get them adjusted. The battery backup is required; without the batteries, the unit chirps. (I returned the product and bought a different brand.)"
4,Good product...,"Have just recently replaced our old CO detectors with three of these First Alert CO615. I must admit, didn't realize they had to be replaced every 5/7 yrs. Our old ones must have been at least 10 yrs. I love the LCD screens on these new ones. The old ones didn't have LCD screens. The features I like on these: 1) Battery backup, doesn't come into affect until there's a power outage, and the battery usage indicator on the LCD. 2) The memory recall of CO levels within the last 24 hrs. Installation was easy, and the initial test was simple. The price on Amazon was much better then what I could find in retail stores. All-in-all a great buy..."
1,Battery door won't stay closed,"I bought two of these earlier this year. Luckily, we have not had an occasion for the alarms to sound. However, on one of the units, the battery door doesn't close properly, and there is not a way to repair it. It stays open slightly most of the time, and occasionally falls open completely. It has been this way since I received it. However, it was not apparent until I opened the product packaging and opened the battery door to insert the batteries. Due to the packaging of this product in hard plastic that had to be completely destroyed to get it out, it wasn't possible to return it once opened."
2,Does it work?,"Despite the other reviews describing situations where this detector might have even been life-saving, I am not convinced that the detector I received actually worked. I never saw my detector register anything other than zero, even during an incident in which we lit a wood fire in an indoor fireplace and forgot to open the flue. The apartment quickly filled with smoke, and doubtlessly abundant carbon monoxide from the smoldering wood, and yet the detector steadfastly registered 0 and didn't make a peep."
3,A important gift,I purchased this Carbon monoxide alarm for my elderly parents to use in their home. They have informed me that it was easy to setup and that it was working just fine.
3,Could be better,"I have two suggestions for improvement. First, the digital readout should be larger so it can be read from further away, but I could have guessed this from the package picture. second, the employment location requirements , which are probably not unique for detector products are difficult to achieve sometimes. Trying minimize the distance from the CO source, proximity to air currents, AC location, and audibility is a confusing puzzle at best. I think that I would have been better off with a battery-operated unit. Or just ignore the requirements as a C,Y,A. legal ease. The description suggested this was an excellent choice for a CO detector and when I bought it, I was somewhat disappointed. It runs on AC power with battery backup, and has the digital readout. It can be mounted directly in an outlet, or the plug can be detached so the now-corded unit can be mounted away from the outlet so that part is very helpful."
1,Broken low battery indicator; batteries very hard to remove,"The detector arrived with a broken low battery detector. Both the batteries it shipped with and a pair of brand new batteries (fresh from the package with an expiration date of 2022) caused the low battery detector chime to sound. Also, the batteries are *very* hard to replace--you have to press very, very hard at just the right angle for them to pop out of the housing. Very frustrating and disappointing for what I hoped would be an easy to use product."
4,Bad neighbors make a good read,"While looking into land fraud for the Domesday Book, our heroes, A Norman Knight and a Saxon Clerk, find murder and kidnapping with a Range War in the 12th century. And a murder to solve. The plot twists and turns carrying you along through a complex landscape of deceit, treachery, love and hate. But it is fascinating and Marstons' writing is marvelous. His historical research shows."
4,great book,This book was a reading assignment for my 7 year old son for school and he really enjoys reading the Magic School Bus series.
5,magic school bus,My grand children love every one of the magic school bus stories and watch and read them over and over again
3,The Magic School Bus,This book is about a class who goes to the musuem but it is closed. So they see it up close. Janet was bragging about everything. After the trip they had learned a lotI think the book is about being nice. The book is about learning new things. Learning new things is part of life. The book is saying to learn. The book is telling us to try new things.I think the book is nice. The book has a series. It teaches you stuff. It also is funny. It's my favorite. It's fun to read.
5,"Okay, but wrong ""If My People...""","If you're looking for the recording of the song which is taken from Second Chronicles 7:14 (""If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray...""), this ISN't the one!'Thought I'd put in this ""heads-up"" for others who may be mistaken, too."
4,Good for a school project,"Honestly, I didn't read the whole thing b/c my professor said it was just a ""guide"" for us to make our imaginary business plan. The steps were helpful."
2,Good start to the book but fizzles out quickly.,"I'm always excited to read different stories about families you don't normally hear much about. There are a myriad of books about Gotti and Capone but this book gave an inside look into the Colombo family from a FRIEND, not a made guy. So the first few chapters are interesting, providing anecdotal info. on Colombo, Gallo, etc., then this ""insider"" turns stoolie because of his gambling debts. The majority of the book then describes him trying to rat out his friends. The reader is hard-pressed to feel sympathy for this self-serving individual. This book never delivers that ""inside"" edge because Cantalupo was never involved in anything more important than numbers running. Don't waste your time, especially if you have to search for the book."
5,"A great band, most underrated!!! Great rock album!","I learned about Kix from my friend who I spent the summer with in Chincoteague, VA, and Kix pretty much was the soundtrack up there in VA; local boys from Maryland who tore it up. I have lots of fond memories from back then, and this album brings them all back! I got to see them in 89 in New York at the Ritz, and they are twice as good live as on their albums. A shame they're not around still (as far as I know...)"
5,Still fun!,"I first bought this album (as an album) in 1981 and it has always been one of my favorites. Like the band, I am from Hagerstown, MD and they received plenty of airplay on the radio.Today I listen to this ""album"" on my iPod, but if you want a great street rock band from the early 80's...you will love the first (and I think the best) KIX album!"
4,Great!!!!!!!!!,"""Kix"" is great. These boys know how to rock!!! Even though they supposedly only had one #1 hit , they still score high in my book!!! Oh, by the way,to the reviewer before me, KIX is from BALTIMORE, not HARRISBURG!!!!!!"
5,kix replacement cd's,"had all the Kix cassettes, but all were stolen, replacing all of them , one by one, seen kix once, great show,"
5,Kix,This is the best that Kix put out. A must for anybody who calls themselves a Kix fan. Cd arrived in great shape at the time it was suppose to arrive.
2,Terribly shallow,"Afro Celt Sound system the number 1 ""world music"" release? King Sunny Ade's ""Ju-Ju"" music barely makes the list. Oriental music is completely neglected along with the Scandinavian roots movement. Franco and O.K. Jazz didn't make it? This guide is a joke."
2,Has problems with wireless keyboards...,"This product has undocumented problems with Microsoft and Logitech WireLess MultiMedia keyboards (most likely all wireless keyboards), namely the port switching doesn't work (rending it useless).Shame on Belkin for not reporting this, and shame on them for not providing support for highend keyboards and mice."
2,Lowered Expectations,"First it seemed to work fine, and I have been using it professionally with two Compaq systems (win2k3 and winxp pro). Then occasionally after a month of usage, I was not able to get control, forcing me to unplug the KVM, and plug in the keyboard/mouse to gain control of the computer. I tried it with an older Dell box (Pentium III era, and I couldn't get it to function at all.Now, this loss of functionality seems to be the norm. I tried using this on two shuttles (winxp 64-bit ed. and win2k3) at home, and I cannot wake up the computers after they go into sleep mode. I tried the IO Gear KVM solution, and I do not have the same problem.Essentially, I left with not only an ugly looking two-port KVM, but a dysfunctional KVM. Given this and other horror stories with other KVMs, I am really disappointed with Belkin, a company that I thought made quality products. I guess this is no longer the case..."
1,Very Annoying,"The Belkin KVM switcher is probably the most annoying piece of electronics I've ever used in my life. Belkin didn't see fit to make a simple switch to toggle between computers. Instead, they made a device that ""thinks."" You press the switch button and sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. Many times, I have to hold the switch down for several seconds, then it will switch, but switch back after a few seconds. There have even been times where I had to disconnect the switcher all together, just to get to the other computer, so I could shut it down, rehook up the KVM switch, and restart, so that the KVM switch would recongnize the fact that there is another computer hooked up to it.This product is worthless to me. I'll be sure to never by another Belkin product again."
1,Works intermittently; seriously flawed design,"The switch will work rather flawlessly for a week then fail miserably. The hot switch refuses to work for no reason. Since the switch does not have a power switch or reset button (significant design flaws) you have to crawl behind your PCs and disconnect all of the plugs. Sometimes I've had to power off a PC without a proper shutdown in order for the switch to recover. Given the hot switches inability to work, Belkin should have at least put a manual switch on the box."
1,Useless junk,"It doesn't reliably switch between computers. I use a Dell & a Compaq. This thing decides to stay at the Compaq and will not let me switch back to the Dell until I unplug cables on the Compaq. Add to that, there are times that I am at the Compaq and my keyboard no longer works, even when I unplug/plug in the KVM. I have to cycle the PC!"
2,Belkin 2-PORT KVM Switch With Cables Keyboard/ Video/ MOUSEPS/2,This is junk. Even for the price. Stopped working after less than 2 months. Spend the money and get a better one.
1,Simply garbage,"This KVM switch will switch to my 2nd computer ok, but it will not recognize the mouse at all on the 2nd computer, which is funny because the mouse in question came with the 2nd computer originally. This product is a waste of money. Period."
2,Doesn't really work,"I can switch from one computer to the other, but I can't switch back. Manual for troubleshooting - doesn't help. Called tech support - also NO help. Back to the drawing board."
1,Not enough power.,"I hooked this switch up to a 17"" LCD monitor, a Dell desktop and an IBM Thinkpad. All worked well, except for monitor flicker when using the Thinkpad that made the switch unusable. I called Belkin support and they told me that this was due to lack of power, even though the switch was pulling from PS/2 ports on both computers. The support person recommended that I purchase Belkin model number F1DB102P, which can take input from an external power supply.I wish I'd known this before I bought it!"
1,A Shameful Disgrace,"This product is Garbage. Belkin ought to be ashamed. I will never buy another Belkin product as long as I live. It worked fine for a while, as other reviewers pointed out, but whatever you do - don't change anything after you get it working. We made the mistake of moving our computer desk to the other side of the room. Unplugged all our equipment, moved it, plugged it back in again. It only sees one of our two computers. No matter what we do, we can't get it to work again. What a waste of life."
1,Enough of the Black Legend,"Greed and cruelty? This is the way a reviewer summs up the Spanish Empire in the Americas? Well, think twice, the Spaniards created the first universities where Indians could study, the first laws to protect the Indians, and an impressive mixed civilization compared with the racism and extermination visited upon the North American Indians, the maoris or the Australian aborigenes by their English masters. It is enough of the Black Legend. The real exponents of cruelty and greediness were the English and the Dutch."
3,Didn't last long with everyday use,"Looked and felt good new. Pilled after a few washes, grew too thin and ripped. Didn't last long with everyday use."
3,Stains don't come out,"These sheets are pretty and generous in size. I have a stain on one pillow case that absolutely will not come out. I am very good at stain removal, and this is just a small stain, but it will not move. They also come out of the dryer very wrinkled. I would not recommend this purchase."
4,Great sheets for a little while...,"Pros: These sheet were absolutely fabulous when I first received them. The stripes, the material, the softness of them gave them a high end look. They were terrific during the summertime as they kept a nice cool feel to them (similar to when you slide into a freshly made bed for the first time) The sheet were wonderful however, they are impossible to find now through Amazon.Cons: I have had the sheets now for at least two years. They did not hold up well through the multiple washes. The sheets separated along the seam of the stripes and I had to throw them away. Now I must confess I did not look at the washing instructions on the tag which may had prolonged thier life. But I actually loved the sheets enough to return to Amazon to look for more to purchase. I was prepared to buy several sets which would decrease the amount of washing. Hopefully they will bring them back at a great price."
5,Excellent,"The shipping was very fast. The packaging was good. I have 2 twin beds, so I ordered the king size. It fits the 2 twin beds perfectly. The skirt looks like ordinary (thin) material but neverthless beautiful.Every one who saw this loved it ... Don't forget that its heavy and keeps you very warm. So we turn on the fan even during winter ..."
2,not comfortable,"I have purchased this set based on the other reviews but i didnt like the product since it was not comfortable,very heavy too."
4,Good Buy,This comforter set is very expensive looking and made of excellent qauality materials. For the price this is a steal. Highly reccomend
4,Comforter set delightful,"I really love this comforter set. It is thick, plush and beautiful. And I got it at such a great bargain price. Amazing! The only reason I didn't rate it 5* was that I have one of the newer mattresses and the comforter would probably fit better on a mattress not so high. But it is still great and I am very happy with it and would highly recommend it."
2,Cute but not worth it.,"These shoes matched my dress perfectly - down to the crystal broach. They were a little higher than I like, but they seemed okay at home - I even walked around in them a little a couple of times to wear them in. They are very cute, but... I took them on a cruise for formal night, and didn't like them at all. The straps kept falling off my heal and they were not comfortable even having not worn them very long that night. I think I ended up leaving them on the ship. No reason to bring them home, I wouldn't have worn them again anyway."
5,Back saver,"I now move the big pieces of firewood easier because I lift and pull at the same time, less back strain and longer reach. Good materials and well constructed. I did reshape the point a little, tapering the point smaller but still give 5 stars because I commonly custom fit tools to my specific needs."
5,So much better than the duo Mehldau disc,"This really sounds more like a Pat Metheny album than the companion disc he did with Brad Mehldau. That one was too busy, and lacked real tunes. This one, with quartet, is melancholy at times, then upbeat. The music really sings in the way that only Pat Metheny can make it. I highly recommend this one."
3,Nice. Pleasant. Disappointed.,"Let me be clear: I am a BIG Metheny and Mehldau fan. Big. Bought this CD (MMQ) without thinking once.Right by the CD player now-- Metheny: PAT METHENY GROUP (from 1978, and I still have the cassette I bought almost 30 years ago!), IMAGINARY DAY, NEW CHAUTAUGUA; Mehldau: DAY IS DONE, HOUSE ON HILL, PLACES; Metheny & Mehldau: Michael Brecker's PILGRIMAGE.And this CD... it's nice... it's pleasant... it's not new age, not elevator music, not smooth jazz... my English friends would say it's lovely... but...But it's hard to listen to. I've tried. Again and again I find my mind wandering. There's so little to grab the attention, and so the mind goes inward. Great background music for a party. I could work to it all day long.And I'm disappointed because I thought Metheny's playing on PILGRIMAGE was just wonderful. Mehldau can thrill even in a trio. Yet MMQ? Nice...Kirtland Peterson"
3,The chemistry is not quite there,"Let me first note that Metheny and Mehldau are two of my favorite musicians. I don't, however, find their collaboration compelling (though I do think it is perfectly pleasant). While the liner notes in the first album suggest that neither artist had to sacrifice their personal style to accomodate the other, I find that, particularly in the quartet context, too much of Mehldau's exploratory and contemplative approach is relinquished so that the trio can serve as a backdrop to Metheny's very fine but predictable structures and phrasings. This was even more evident in the recent live performance I attended. I'm glad they made these recordings. But I hope the collaboration is short-lived, as each of these artists is more in their element in other contexts."
4,Depends on what you expect...3 1/2 stars,"I read several stunning reviews, before this cd even hit the stores where I live. Having been a long time avid fan of Pat Metheny and the Brad Mehldau Trio, I must admit I was a little disappointed after listening to the cd. Obviously, since these are the guys playing, it is good! However, it being a Quartet edition, I had expected something a little more ""explosive"" than the last release. I had expected something more in the line of the tune ""Ring of Life"" from their last album (which is a great tune, also featuring the Quartet).This one is very mellow, I find, but ofcourse their playing is really good."
2,Mehldau is no Mays,"I have been a huge Metheny fan since the Offramp tour. But I find this CD almost unlistenable. All of the Mehldau/Metheny music sounds like ""Pat Light""--you know, ""Weather Channel music."" I absolutely do not hear what so many others apparently hear in Mehldau's playing. More Lyle!More Lyle all the time!"
3,Horrible display,"The radio works as expected for a pioneer product, which is pretty good. No complaints about performance, it does what if should. However, the display is horrible during the day, fine at night. There is so much glare on the display. I guess because it bows outward and reflects a lot of light. If not for the display I would highly recommend this product."
3,"good radio, horrible display",i know the display is not the most important part of a radio but this is bad. at night it's fine but during the day you can't see anything and trying to figure out a track number is hard as well.. it's hidden all the way on the right side and very small. i love the radio but i wish i would of shopped around more
5,Greg Taylor's Da Vinci in America,"There is a lot of information to be found in this book of 178 pages.The first thing I am going to do now I have read it is to re-read Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons to look for all the interesting little things that this author pointed out in this book.The chapter The Masonic Foundation of America is fascinating and readers will be surprised to learn that the Founding Fathers had Masonic involvement, and thus built the city of Washington on it's principles.The book contains conspiracies, and cryptograms and how to decode them, the Ku Klux Klan and Rosicrucians and the not so tenuous link between the Templars and Freemasonry.The book does not need any attachment to Dan Brown's The Solomon Key , but will stand alone as a handy item of reference for many years to come.B.PattisonAustralia"
5,Impeccably researched and deciphered,"A literary landmark of scholarly excavation into mysteries behind our cultural conditions and the formative causations of our world's relationships. Even if you are not fascinated by Dan Brown's subject matter, this book is very well worth reading."
5,You Have TO BY THIS BOOK. Kathy Elliott,"IHATE HISTORY BUT THIS WAS GREAT| I just order Ban Brown/s New Book On Kindle so I thought I would Get this book So I""ed brush up on some history and it Was A Very EasyRead Love It."
3,unexpected,"The book is ok, it has a lot of information. But I can not wait for the actual book to come out."
1,Pointless bandwagon-jumping,"What's Dan Brown's next book going to be about? He's already said: Freemasonry, and it's set in America. So Greg Taylor hauls together a bunch of readily available material about the masonic influence of the founding fathers of the USA. His potted history of Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry is reasonably good. But his discussion of the esoteric layout of Washington DC is borrowed wholesale from The Secret Architecture of Our Nation's Capital (previously published as The Secret Zodiacs of Washington DC) by David Ovason.And someone should tell Taylor that simony is nothing to do with magick!All a bit silly, really. Why not wait till Brown's next waste-of-a-good tree comes out?"
1,making money out of someone else's efforts,"Grab a very successful write/book, make a tricky book about it and people will automatically buy it. It's a pity people actually support these kind of rip offs. If you're a real fan of Dan's, just wait for HIS book and leave the wanna-bes on the side."
2,would be an OK book if not for errors,"I was reading this book to get familiar with some of DBA work in Oracle and found that it had lots of errors and typos in the areas that I know as well as obvious mistakes in examples. If I see that it's wrong about things I know - how can I trust it about the things I don't know? Read with caution, don't be surprized when examples don't work."
2,Oracle A Beginner's Guide,"This book suffers from a lack of consistant tone and flow. The chapter on PL/SQL is bad. The examples are incomplete and poorly explained. The SQL and DBA chapters are decent. This book doesn't appear to be a labor of love. The updates for Oracle 8 and 8i add a couple of chapters, but the failings of the earlier editions remain."
1,too bad neither card nor software work,"specs were great, so I decided to give at a try despite the warnings from others. Now I'm returning it back. First, WinDVR won't install on my XP Pro system. In the very beginning of the installation it gives ""remote procedure call failed"" and aborts. MSI web site has the same faulty version. Intervideo doesn't want to deal with this issue, ""If you need OEM (bundled) support for an Intervideo product, please contact the OEM for that information because we do not provide exhuastive support for OEM versions of the program"" Ok, downloaded the latest version of WinDVR 3.0. This one installs and seems to work. And what do I get from the MSI card? - Just a beautiful blue screen on all channels."
5,It works as advertised,"After the first failed try, I scored six squirrels in a row. The last animal must have been a bit larger, as he left with the trap. It pays to stake it down with the chain. My advice in setting it: Paste some sunflower seeds to a small piece of paper, and paste the paper to the bait plate. Set the trap carefully and place the trap with the back against a wall."
1,Appalling,"Save your money: Pandemic promises much and delivers little. Predictable plot, stereotyped characters, and so much encyclopediac virology you'll gag. (You would have much more fun reading Internet web sites related to epidemiology.)"
3,So So,Not quite what I was expecting. Certainly not one of my better choices for a book to read. Didn't keep my interest.
3,"A solid three stars. No more, no less.","I love both medical thrillers and apocalyptic novels, so this was right up my alley. It satisfied those tastes, but meh, that was it. The ""bad guys"" weren't very convincing. There were too many easily mixed up characters -- not distinct enough for me to remember exactly who was who. A solid three stars. No more, no less."
4,Good Reading,Read it in 2 days. Realistic Muslim terrorist bio threat with a slight love twist added in. The book was very a simplistic no brainer. I enjoyed it.
5,What if terrorists gave martyrs a killer flu?,"It started as the flu..... What if terrorists ""weaponized"" a killer flu and sent martyrs out to infect the rest of the world? Kalla is a Vancouver doctor, who write this after the SARs scare. Move over Robin Cook here is another author who can scare you while you are sitting on your sofa. Good pace, and better character development than most ""popular"" writers bother with these days. (This review is for all my friends who wanted me to also list my ""fiction"" reads. If I don't watch much TV - I get more reading in)"
4,"A Timely, Well-Written Novel","I picked this book up off of the shelf at my local library, as I thought that it looked interesting enough and I hadn't read a book in quite a while. As it turned out, this was an excellent read.Even though the author is a first time novelist (and this can be seen in a number of places), he captures the reader's attention very well. There is a lot of medical / viral terminology, but I did not find that I got lost or confused. The novel starts out a bit slow, but definitely picks up as it goes along. The situations leading up to the climax are quite realistic and very possible in today's world.Overall, an interesting novel and a great effort for a first time novelist who happens to be an ER doctor from Canada."
3,It could have been a lot better.,"I think this could have been a LOT better if I didn't feel like I was reading the novelization of a bad TV movie. All the characters were nothing more than stereotypes, and after a while it just got annoying. The storyline was interesting, but the typical Middle East gets revenge storyline is old and weak. And the dialogue was horribly written and there were numerous grammatical errors.All in all, it could have been better if a lot of things had been changed."
4,a must for any college basketball fan,"An exremely entertaining book which takes you on a trip across the United States to examine the great venues and stories of college basketball. From the awesome early-season tournaments in Hawaii to the meccas of college basketball like the Palestra and Madison Square Garden to March Madness, from the Lute Olsen-Steve Kerr Arizona Wildcats to the Admiral to Danny Manning, Feinstein's book is a must for any fan of college basketball."
4,Close to Greatness,"Some of the greatest pop songs of all time are included on this compilation. Bobby Darin was a major contemporary music icon in his day. His career is amply represented here, starting with the early pop lightheartedness of ""Splish Splash"". You can hear Darin's maturity as a singer through to the non-stop swing of ""Mack the Knife"", a masterpiece of swing/pop interpretation. The inflections and fills that Darin adds make it an enduring classic. The real gem is the unbeatable ""Beyond the Sea"". For an idea of just how perfect a pop song and its arrangement can be, listen this cut a few times. The rest of the songs are not as well known, but are highly listenable and masterfully arranged. For an example of how talented this performer was, check out ""Clementine"", a fairly maudlin folk song, here turned into a rollicking masterpiece.The sound quality is vintage '50s, so don't expect perfection. But this doesn't get in the way of an excellent compilation."
5,"A brief, but very adequate sampler of Bobby's best work","The Bobby Darin Story contains 12 of Bobby's biggest hits with his personal background and stories behind the songs in between the music. This is the collection one should start their collection with. The personal background and stories behind the songs add a lot to the disc. It does leave off a few great hits, but you can't go wrong buying this collection. This is the disc to get ""Splish Splash,""""Mack The Knife,"",""Beyond The Sea"" plus more on one very inexpensive CD. The collection sounds fabulous."
4,Turned the lights out in the store,"I titled that because I had been in the store over an hour hour and was just about to give in looking for something that would lift my spirit and this tape caught my eye. I didn't realize that ""Order My Steps"" was on it till my got home and had a chance to read the tape. I just wish I could get it on CD to add to my collection. Truly a heart warming and lifting experience listening to this tape, My favorites are ""Make Your Heart My Home"" and ""Down In My Soul"". Definitely not dispointed by this tape. If you haven't been to church after listening to this you will truly feel as though you were, and if u don't attend u will want to go."
1,not a valid representation of Gurdjieff....,"The only value of this book is that it might lead the unknowing reader to explore Gurdjieff and his teaching as presented truthfully by many, many other writers who worked directly with him--as did some of Perry's sources who were misrepresented to say the least. Go further if you wish to know Gurdjieff....one star for mentioning the name Gurdjieff in his title......"
3,if only he could write,"Guenon's ideas, leaving aside his relentless negativity, provide plenty of food for thought -- that is, if you can somehow extract them from his tortured prose, which is full of page-length sentences, convoluted logic, meaningless parenthetical asides, dependent clauses, and so on. Exactly the sort of bad, no, terrible writing we have come to expect from the intellectual class. I recommend that you read Julius Evola instead. It's the same thing only better stated. Much better stated."
1,Do not buy this book!,"Because it is the most incomprehensible book I have ever tried to read.I was originally triggered by the title, hoping this book would offer me insights from French philosophy relevant to Weberian issues around rationalization etc. It may be the case that someone in human history is able to establish whether this is the case or not.For me this book has proven to be completely inaccessible twice now. It contains essays of app. 5 pages each, that usually are unclear, contain irrelevant and distracting references to unrelated issues (e.g. Indian mythology) and proceeds with pointless texts. A complete waste of time and money!"
3,256MB ??,"I sent in a request for Amazon to de/re list this product, saw saveral reviews that Tiger Direct shipped 128mb card even though description says 256mb. After I recieved an acknowledgement back from Amazon, it appears this item has been relisted, and all the reviews are gone, but it is still listed at 256mb.I'd contact Tiger Direct about this listing to ensure that Amazon has corrected the problem.BTW - Get a 5900 or higher if you want any real performance."
4,great for price!,"not a bad product, installation was weird until i just twisted it like normal and it fastened perfectly. the bottom piece did not screw on good and at times falls but i just tighten it again. It doesn't bother me much b/c it looks great. But it does feel a little weird after i took my original handle off, but nothing that cannot be accustomed to. not bad im not mad with my purchase. 4 stars b/c it is cheap but the look and feel hides the cheapness and price is nice"
2,not fit for 350z,"I bught the item for nissan 350Z MT.but this item not fit to Z-car due to construction method, shift length & DIA. notice: check the your Shift Knob DIA.tight 3-HEX bolt is too heavy lock shift knobwhen tight up screw-cap made by ABS,made clearance for shft-cover."
5,Wonderful Christmas Music - filtering all over my home.,This is my favorite Christmas music. Somehow I misplaced my album of many years. I was grateful to find another copy at Amazon!
1,Waste of time!,"This book was so poorly written and edited (was it edited?) that I can't believe it made it to publication. The only reason I kept reading, but not to completion, was to find the next absurdity, incongruity, word misuse, misspelling or word repetition that should have been edited. Please, please don't let a movie be made from this book."
1,poor excuse of a novel,"This is possibly one of the worst novels ever written. My guess is that it was accidentally published, when it was supposed to be tossed into the nearest shredder. This book deserves to be tossed into a tank of novel hungry piranhas. I would suggest throwing it into the ocean, but I wouldn't want to contaminate our seas anymore than they already are."
1,Don't waste your time!,"This book was truly one of the worst I have ever read - or shall I say tried to read because after fifty pages of useless alliteration, complex verbiage, and unsympathetic characters, I decided it was not worth grappling with and put it down.The fact that all the main characters have names beginning with B, makes the book extremely complicated and difficult to follow. How a piece of writing this horrible was ever published is a mystery to me. And this author went to Harvard!?!"
1,Worst book I've ever read,"I wanted to like this book. The premise was so interesting, even more so when I learned that the very unlikely family was similar to the author's. I wonder why the editor didn't catch the mixed metaphors, boring repetitions, and misused words on almost every page. I think we were meant to like this family, but were shown very little to like. The word sneered appeared over and over and sums up the way these very unpleasant people spoke to each other.I was fairly intrigued with the story but I gave up about 3/4 of the way through. It was simply unreadable."
1,1 star is almost too many...,"I've given up after about 100 pages. The only reason I made it that far was it was the only book I took with me on a weekend trip! I had nothing else to do on the plane and kept picking it up, reading another few pages until I couldn't stand it anymore, putting it down to stare at the seat in front of me, and then repeating the process out of boredom. I agree with other reviewers that it has a lot in common with Royal Tenenbaums, which is a movie that I love. Reading about insanely quirky, rich, self-absorbed characters just isn't as amusing. The writing was mostly bad, the little literary references and tricks were too obvious, the characters were unlikeable, and it all seemed very self-indulgent."
4,Fascinating Book,"Those of us stuck in the U.S. with little contact with any other culture than our own will be fascinated by this book. Marilyn Stewart's observations about the differences between the aboriginal way of thinking and the western world's are a goldmine, and because this is her story, you feel as though you know these people and the way they think. I truly felt I had walked a mile in her shoes. While her unconventional style of writing may make the reading a little more difficult than the average fluff, it is well worth the effort. Don't miss this book!"
2,airport card,The range is extremely limited. My other airport cards work anywhere in the house. this one must be in the next room from the base or close or it loses the signal.
5,Super Fast and Super Easy To Install,"This Airport card was easy to install, just pop up the keyboard push it in then you power up the computer. And it is surprisingly fast. i use it for Google every day and it is a pleasure to use."
5,"Bought a brand new one, works right out of the box!","I was fixing and upgrading a friend's eMac made from 2003. The eMac never came with an AirPort card, so I had to order one for it. I first ordered a used one from OWC, but turns out the card was already degraded -- The card could never connect to WiFi. So I searched online for a while to find another one, this time I found one from Amazon, a seller that sells new AirPort cards that still sealed in the original retail boxes. This time the card worked right out of the box. My friend was really excited to see his outdated eMac could finally go wireless and much faster with Tiger OS X 10.4 (the last Mac Operating System his eMac model could handle) than the original Jaguar OS X 10.2 system."
1,Be Very Careful Who You do Business With!,"I bought an air card fro this seller, and it was broken. I wasn't able to use it, and the person who sold it to me never responded. Very pissed I was. With electronics, you have better chances spending a little more at FRY's electonics or the like, than on Amazon. Too much hassel that what it's worth."
1,bummer,was not what we expected but hey... we expect too much. Would I recommend it to anyone? That would be a hard question to answer. If the person was knowledgeable... probably not.
1,terrible router and terrible firmware,"I bought this router to use with my AT&T; DSL line.I have had Cayman and 2Wire routers for years with no troubleThis router gives me constant greif...Particularly the DHCP Server.The DHCP server dishes out IPs (lease period 3 min).and leaves the IPs hung and unusable when the user logs out of windows.Better yet, there is nothing in the firmware to reclaim a hung IP !I am constantly having to tinker with this router to keep it workingDo yourself a BIG favor and buy a linksys or 2wire router!"
4,Use an Adapter--Eats Batteries,"This product works great. It's easy to connect, and easy to use. The volume control is a big help when a caller is faint. You can also adjust the outgoing volume easily.It has one significant flaw--it goes through batteries so quickly that it's not worth using this device unless you use a power adapter with it, which I now do."
4,M22 Amplifier,The amplifier and its linking binural headphones provide a loud clear sound that allow me to type telephone interviews as I conduct them. It is something I've been looking for for a couple years.My only problem has been contacting the company for the optional plug-in cord so that I don't have to use batteries all the time.S
3,Good product if I didn't work in such a noisy place,I work in a machine shop so I have a lot of background noise. I ordered this in hopes I could hear better with my headset however it seemed to be quiter than the original M12 amplifier I already had. I returned this item. I am sure if you work in a quite enviroment it would work great.
2,I should have sent it back,I had to get a new land phone to get it to work better.I get a humming noise if I turn the incoming volume up.The company said that I should return it and get another unit.I just tolerate the background noise.
2,"Too much white noise, and callers said I sounded ""far away""","This just didn't sound clear, and I didn't sound clear to the person on the other end. I packed it up and sent it back the day I got it."
1,Junk,I purchased this for my call room. It did not work. We spent an hour on the phone with Plantronics and they were unable to get it working.
2,Battery wasting noisy piece of garbage,"We use these where I work, and while they work fine for listening/speaking, they are poorly designed.They are ALWAYS ON, your phone can be hung up, but if you put the headset on, you can hear the speaker is 'on' with some background noise. It is running off of the batteries 24/7. The best solution is to remove the battery door and leave that off until you want to use it. This is a hassle, since the battery door is quite stiff/hard to get on/off when new.Also, there are a few dials and switches on it, which you have to use a silly little tool (included on the back) with it to 'adjust' the headset to your phone system. I'm sure there's a technical reason for 'adjusting' the system, but I've never had to adjust any phone/handset/headset before.Also, I had one, and dropped it 2 feet, and it cut out and won't work anymore. I realize it was my fault for dropping it, but I would have expected a little bit sturdier build."
1,Poor quality amplifier for Plantronics Avaya headset,"I was very disappointed in the product. It did not work with the Plantronics Avaya headset (Plantronics H171 Avaya) I ordered that was recommended for the amplifier. When I plugged the headset into the amplifier, both of my cats went tearing out of the room, as a very loud high-pitched tone came from the amplifier. I tried switching the amplifier to every setting, and 3 of the settings had the same loud tone. I could not hear a thing from the headset, regardless of which setting I chose on the amplifier. I did some research online, and used the recommended settings but nothing worked. I believe this product was defective or just very poor quality right out of the box. Very disappointed in the quality and performance."
4,"Great info, bad pictures","This book seems to be really informative so far. We're in the midst of designing a 700 square foot data center and there are a lot of great tips and tricks we never would have thought of in there.My only complaint so far is the quality of the pictures. They're all black and white, which is fine, but they look like they've been photocopied about 20 times before they made it to the book. Very poor quality there for the price."
2,Not enough bang for your buck,"I thought this book was way overpriced for what I received. It looks like someone made it by themselves on a Xerox machine, certainly not worth the $60+ dollars I paid for it. The pictures actually look like photo copies.You should be aware that this book is written for someone who is going to build out a data center facility from the ground up. I didn't think it was intended for the average data center person who rents floor space from a collocation provider and doesn't have a lot of control over the actual facilites themselves.Not very many companies in this business can afford to build their own data centers and most, even the big companies, still rent space from a provider. Just keep that in mind when considering this book.There is some good information in this book but in my opinion it isn't worth the money it cost to purchase it. Purchse at your own risk."
5,An Important New Star In The Firmament,"At a time when everybody wants (or wants to be) a great new singer-songwriter that can speak to the sophisticated but starving pop audience in 2000, Mary Lee's Corvette has the field virtually to themselves. ""Need For Religion"" alone should be honored at Grammy time in 2000."
2,Awkward,"This book is rather muddled. In an attempt to explicate the workings of the cryptic clue, the author has invented a bewildering variety of terms (e.g. olapsek, parabrebit) that makes the text more confusing than the clues themselves. Poor organization and type design exacerbate the problem.It does list quite a few of the standard equivalencies found in (British) puzzles, and is somewhat useful in that regard, but beginners will find the Random House guide to be much more helpful."
3,Nice sized,"I expected it to be thicker and warmer, but the print on it is very cute. And for it being a fleece blanket it was huge! So no complaints here. :)"
3,Great blanket,This blanket is beautifully designed but felt a little cheap and wasn't really that soft. I expected it to be bigger also but that's not really anyone's fault but my own.
5,"A simply Fabulous ""friend"" for my Westie!","I have ordered three thus far, and my Lord Quincy is a bit older now, and likes to strut around the house with one in his mouth. Although this is mostly due to his puppy-little brother, who likes to kiss him a BIT too much, lol. But it's a big part of his life now, and I pray Harley-Davidson never goes out of business!Altogether a well-made toy that I would recommend to anyone who has a dog with strong enough teeth to carry it around.WoofWoof!DonnaBahamaLord QuincyFriar Tucker."
3,Dog not a fan of the Rubber Boot,Thought our dog would love this. Not so. I don't know if it is the texture or the air that comes from the squeaker.
5,THIS MUSIC STIRS THE SOUL,"I first heard North Sea Gas while I was on a business trip to Edinburgh in 1991 at the Caledonian Hotel. I have been a fan ever since. Their music is very uplifting and exciting. The songs are toe taping and moving. ""Flower of Scotland"" I think captures the soul of the Scottish people. The song about the Alamo would stir any American. I had a great time that night when I first saw them and definately you wont be dissapointed if you purchase this CD. If this is your first NSG CD, It wont be your last. A new CD Dark Island is available and I just purchased it."
4,"Good, really good.","Yeah, just get it.These guys are good, really good. They and this CD are the essence of what Surf Instrumentals are about. I would rate the individual tracks on this CD from about 3 1/2 stars to 5 stars. The addition of the sax is great--okay, maybe not an essential in the genre but I like it and it works. The quality of the playing is very good to excellent. Quality of the recording is excellent throughout. Originality may be the only weak point but there's enough interesting stuff here that you won't be bored I'd bet.Bottom line: If you surf/surf revival then this one is a must have. Same thing even if you just like instrumental guitars."
4,From Beginner To Low Handicapper,"Although this book is for golfers at all levels, it is probably best for those who have some knowledge of the game. This is one that will be read over and over again. I have been through it twice and am now on the third reading, bookmarking those sections that, for me, are the most importand. The drawings will be a little difficult for the novice but if looked at with a golf club in hand, they will make sense. I have been (tried to be a golfer) for more than 40 years and have read most of the books on the market and this book by Jim Mclean is by far the best."
1,Golf School:,"BAD! Wow; this man gets plenty of press and great reviews, but I cannot see why! The book is written at a grade eight reading level, and it does not state anything new. In fact, this author understates everything. Books and videos by Dede Owens, Sam Snead, and Jack Nicklaus will give you more and cost less."
1,Failed Attempt at a Good Idea,"This book has one redeeming quality: the volume contains many unusual and telling 'pieces' descriptive of American history.However,the volume is flawed in two fatal and fundamental ways. 1) There is no bibliography, thus the reader has no way to determine where the editors located their material. For example, the first piece in the volume (""How the World was Made"") is simply attributed to 'The Cherokee Nation'. 2) The editing of the material is suspect at best. The Rev. Dr. King's ""Letter from Birmingham Jail"" has been redacted from its original fifty pargraphs to a mere 18 without wxplanation. Don't buy this book."
2,this gun(obviously!),i ordered this gun about 2 weeks ago and it still hasnt come the shipping wether regular or expited(whatever that means) takes too freakin long when i get the gun and test it out ill post another review but i you look at this gun to buy it look around for different ones because the shipping sucks. the longer you wait the longer you cant be out shooting your friends .....remember that...
3,Ok,Unfortunately when I bought this it was not PCI express. I thought itdidn't matter. I learned that before it wrecked my computer though so that's good. So before you buy this make sure you have the right system requirnments.
5,"FoxTrot strips from December 29, 1997 to October 8, 1998","Roger tries to get Jason away from the Jupiter 64 so he can watch football. Andy goes ""Titanic""-crazy.

4,A great album,"I first got a record player a few months ago, for my thirteenth birthday. In A Gadda Da Vida was my first record, and still one of my favorites. This version is even better, with both a live and single version of the title track. It's great to listen to it in a cd player, because you can always tell how much time is left!You know, everyone always says how they hated the first five tracks on the album, but they are not really that bad. They aren't exactly #1 material, but they are a heck of a lot better than a lot of today's stuff, Linkin Park, etc. I would indeed recommend it to anyone who likes classic rock, punk rock, and all of the rest of that stuff. Peace out."
1,Awful Sound Quality,"This review is for the ATCO CD. I was amazed at how bad the sound was. The sound stage was totally flat and everything sounded tinny. There was a strange ""pumping"" to the vocals on in-a-gadda-vida where the volume pulsed louder and then softer, while in the background there was this muffled thumping. This has to be the worst sound quality I have every heard from a compact disc. Unfortunately I no longer have my original LP to compare it to, but I suspect most of the blame is due to the poor digital remastering. Even the hiss is quite apparent. I am sure they could have done a better job removing that. While I enjoyed the reminiscing quality of listening to the title track, the sound quality made it a painful experience."
5,"Works great, but what a pain to replace!","Installed this two weeks ago and it works fine. But beware -- if you have a Ford Focus Zetec 2.0 it is really tough to get the old alternator out and the new one in (negative clearances all around). I had to disconnect everything around it, and still bent a couple prongs to get the !$%#& thing out. Have fun!"
2,Can abs be not so boring?,"The workout is very easy and... boring! I'ts divided in 2 section, the first one for abs, the second one for legs and buns. The exercises are not various and very specifical: crunches for your stomach, squat for your legs. You just have to repeat two/three exercises fos some minutes. When I bought it, I tought to find in this dvd a fun combination, or different exercises i didn't know. Nothing like that. It's certainly useful for a total beginner, but not for a person who was looking for a complete and various workout for abs and buns. It's quite... ""old""!There is no possibility to chose different levels and workouts, and you have to combine this dvd to another workout to have some results..."
3,Scotland Forever,"I was pleased with Tommy Scott's talent and choice of songs. The scenery was beautiful. We have been to Scotland and I was very interested in the scenery and wanted to share it with others. I was disappointed that I could not play this DVD in our DVD player to show on the television screen. However, I was able to play it on my computer. There are some sun glares on some of the scenes which were distracting. But all things considered this is an enjoyable DVD."
4,Great CD,"I was looking for a CD to help me create a back drop of music for a Black History Celebration I was organizing for my church. I wanted to capture the natural sound of music accompanied by singers, that was strong enough to envoke feelings of both hope and triumph under pressure. This CD was a great help.It is smooth and silky,but still tough and full of feelings.I would definately suggest this CD for your listening needs."
4,Just in time,"Fits great has cool designs, so my son did not mind wearing it all the time in the sun during our vacation. Lost one star for making me worry if it would arrive to late, it arrived the day before we left. Average size 13 year old kid, mens large fit perfect should last a few years."
3,Snug is an understatement,"This is my fourth rash guard shirt and easily the tightest. I am 6'3"" and 180 lbs so I ordered the large as I had with the others and it was nowhere close to the right size. This is the snuggest fit of any I have owned. Nothing wrong with that just good to know. I would easily go with an XL but am opting for a different model that is more tshirt like in fit rather than Spidey Suit. Really cool looking if you fit in it right though."
1,Body Glove mens shirts,Be aware that even an XL size is more or less comparable to a medium in a T-shirt size. I had to return it.
5,Great swim shirt...,I purchased this shirt to help protect me while snorkeling during a Western Caribbean cruise.It worked. Although one caution: make sure you put sunblock on your upper arms or lower back where the sleeves or the shirt might ride up while swimming.Strongly agree with the recommendations to purchase one size larger than your normal shirt size. XL fit just right (I normally where Large).
1,Runs two sizes too small,My husband normally wears a medium or large form fitting T-shirt. He tried the XL in this rash guard and could barely try it on....I'm not sure a XXL would even fit. Terrible sizing. Not buying clothes from amazon again - much easier to return to Zappos.
4,The future really is now,"((FREQUENCIES)) is vivid, fast-paced ride into the Seattle of 2051. Ortega's ideas reverberate from today's world into a vision of the future that is scary, wonderful, and hopeful all at the same time. In the aftermath of the WTO and Seattle's response to the millennium, the political domination of the Frequencies world is omniously real. Things that were once fantastically impossible- cloning, nanotechnology, transhumanism- come to life as we can imagine them doing only in the opening days of the twenty-first century. And things we already know- remote thought monitoring, love and adventure- are revealed in all their multiply-faceted glory. Needless to say, once you start to explore this story, it won't stop with book. The only question I have is, when does the sequel come out?"
2,I don't think so,"I've read better dystopic views of the future. This view of the future is just not that plausible - except for the idea that virtually unlimited money can buy unlimited power and influence. ""Ordosoft"" is a thinly veiled and somewhat contrived evolution of Microsoft. In addition, the bad grammar (not in dialog, but in the narration) is jarring and not excusable. I'd take a pass on this one - or borrow it from the library if you must read it."
1,terrible - rotten - stinky,"I thought this book was quite a bad read because when the ideas weren't cliche they were dumb and the characters were poorly developed and unbelievable... and most of all because the author cannot write his way out of a paper bag. If you want an ""unknown"" pulpy cyberpunk book that actually is a good read try Jennifer Government or the When Gravity Fails series instead..."
5,Awesome reading!,"If you're interested in Warhammer 40,000 and the Black Library, the Soul Drinker series is definitely the one you must read! William King is great and Dan Abnett is also incredible, but Ben Counter rocks. I've read the complete Soul Drinker series (Three books so far)and his Grey Knights novel, which is also state of the art. The storyline of the Soul Drinkers is something completely new in the Warhammer 40k world. In the other series you learn about the adventures of superhuman Space Marines warriors, totally committed to the Human Empire and the Golden Throne.The Soul Drinkers are different, as they, after being betrayed by those they once served and protected, search for a better way to serve their Emperor, without obeying to a Human Empire which is completely corrupted in their minds. Not to tell too much, get the first book and drown in this marvellous story of Space Marines Chapter which is declared heretic by the Empire and hunted down all over the galaxy."
5,The best of the warhammer 40K genre - but there is a catch,"The is pretty much amongst the best of the ""Warhammer 40K"": escapist military SF genre.But.The next book or two in the series do pretty well, but Ben Counter is unable to maintain this level. If you like the warhammer 40K universe, or guilty-pleasure escapist military SF in general, read this book, but be warned, as the series progresses the quality goes down."
5,"Excellent book, great entry for the Black Library","I love how the book goes, while the ending is interesting it was not how i hoped originally, but now i want to read the other books to find out exactly what happens. Pretty Shocking i thought, what they went through in detail. One not to be missed."
3,Comedy..If you can Find It,"This is Carlin before he became complicated. This is just his goofy material. Stuff about stuff, rice krispies, and having a nice day make me teary-eyed with laughter. Great comedy!If you can find it. This album consists mostly of so-so studio material. the Game show bit is probably his worst, along with Fourth Announcements (Fog Retrival League?). However, The book club and the 1st through 4th announce ments are very funny! G\reat comedy.. If you can find it!"
4,Excellent middle period Carlin,"This was the first Carlin album I heard (I knew of him from TV appearences like the Baseball vs. Football routine). At the time, I was bowled over. I was glad I still liked it now. This album could have used less commercial parodies and more stand up but overall a great listen. The title track is a classic, also love fussy eater and have a nice day. He's gone beyond the hippie persona of the 70s but hasn't become the curmudgeon of his last few years."
3,Carlin in the early years,"I am a big Carlin Fan, BUT Starting from the 90s on. The early years are not so my favourite thing."
1,Worst Carlin CD Ever,"this is by far the worst carlin cd ever. he foregoes his observational humor which is the funniest around, and attempts to do skit humor. i for one, hate skit humor and was upset almost to the point of being mad that i baught the cd. this is definately the worst carlin out on the market. avoid this one. i would give it a rating of '0' if i could."
1,very expensive to operate,"This unit is so expensive to operate and sent our electric bills through the roof!! We hardly ever turn it on now, because we can't afford it and wish that we had never bought it."
4,A good album,"I've never heard of Lene Marlin before. I came across a record shop and found this CD and thought it look interesting enough for me to buy it, and so I did. After I have listened to it, I'm glad that it's worth my money. All the songs are good and I love her voice. However, you might find the fact that all the tracks sound quite similar to one another. My favourite songs from this album are 'Sorry' and 'You Weren't There'. The lyrics were nicely written as well. Really, it's worth buying."
3,Definitely NOT an asian Boyz N the Hood,"This movie, although at times interesting, can be contrived and predictable. The dialogue was at times horrible. More of a rental movie...watch it, and forget about it...there are better asian gangster movies out there."
2,Panels,The panels arrived in a timely manner and seemed ok until I looked closer at them. There were small (1-3 inche) faint ink marks in random areas on each one. It looked like a line from an ink pen. I liked the color and was able to use them anyway.
2,"Elegance Voile 216"" Beige Scarf COLOR",LIKE THE PRODUCT IT'S SELF- SATISIFIED W/QUICK DELIVERY HOWEVER THE COLOR HAS MORE YELLOW IN IT THAN IT LOOKS ON THE PICTURE HERE. THAT IS ALL. SO I JUST FOUND ANOTHER SPOT TO PUT IT TO USE
2,gold scarf,I was looking for something that was a true gold and this is was more yellow than gold but it works.
1,Voile Bisque Sheer Scarf,the product felt cheap and appeared to be cheaply made. Bunching along the seams are unsightly and the actual seam appears tacky and flimsy.
1,never arrived,"I waited...and waited.... and waited but my curtains never arrived, When looking at the tracking info I foune that even though I was charged for them and the company said they were sent, they have never been picked up by ups. Seems as if this company needs a better handle on its orders."
5,A great resource!,"I reach for this cookbook again and again when I want to make a phyllo item. There are basic recipes for Greek classics like Spanokopita, Kreatopetes, Sambusik, and Baklava plus innovative reworkings from other cuisines, such as a great Shrimp Toast and a Chinese Fire Cracker dessert as well as Southwestern/TexMex style (try the phyllo quesadillas or chimichangas), phyllo calzones, savory and sweet strudels, etc. This book has loads of folding suggestions, going well beyond the typical triangles and rolls to include crinkle cups and several different tart shells, as well as instructions for using phyllo to encase and bake entree portions of chicken or fish or how to wrap and bake brie in phyllo. A great ressource!"
4,Great all around CD,"I only knew two Jason Aldean songs when I bought this CD, but I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised. I really like it. I feel like my taste is varied, I like country, pop, some rap, and alternative stuff. I like how he is ""blue collar"". Plus he has a really sexy voice. :) I love the song ""asphalt cowboy."" He is the working mans/womans singer."
5,"Saw him live, just picked up the CD","I saw Jason live at a Texas Rangers game back in June. I was impressed and thought I'd buy the CD upon its release. I even strated a fan page for Jason. I just finally got around the getting the CD and enjoy it more than even my high hopes expected. I can't get ""Amarillo Sky"" out of my head and that's not a bad thing. My 2 year old son and I dance around the house the the Hicktown track. It rocks. The rest of the album isn't quite as ""fun"" as Hicktown, but it's darn good."
3,Not his Best - repetitive melodies,"Good album, but falls short of both Relentless and Wide Open. Several songs with similar melodies makes this album's songs very repetitive."
3,very short workout,"It is a short (~15 minutes) workout, although effective. I am not sure I would buy it again though."
4,daughters bike,Santa brought this to my daughter last year. She loved it!!! She loved the color and rides it often. I only gave it a four star b/c of the difficulty I had assembling it. I am usually very good with that sort of thing but the steering mechanism was not easy to assemble.
3,Nice bike!,"Seems like a nice, sturdy bike. It's currently still too big for my daughter. But, once she grows into it - I'm sure it'll be great."
2,weird,"This CD will NOT play on my Windows Vista computer, It will not import to iTunes or Windows Media Player. I've ordered a US version to hear the songs, you may want to think about that before you buy."
2,U.S. Army Survival Handbook,"A very accurate book. It covers a lot of information, and is therefore not very precise, but it teaches you the basics of what you need to know, and I recommend it to anyone interested in survival techniques."
4,"Good info, a reference not a novel","This is a great quick reference or something to help you learn if you are with someone with a little experience. Being in the Army I found it very easy to follow and as a quick reference. But, a buddy of mine picked up one to learn some camping/hiking skills and found it hard to follow. There is a bit of lingo used and a lot of what is explained is done so in a quick to the point way. The diagrams can be a bit vague as well. This is not a ""camping for dummies"" sort of book. It is obvious that it was made for the Army, people with a background in the outdoors already. Anyone can learn something and if you are with someone who can explain some of the complexities you will get a lot out of the book."
5,US army survival handbook,"excellent info ,very informative giving actual directions and pictures of survival techniques. Clear explicit writing understandig to a non civil service person."
4,More Quizzes for Great Children's Books,"More Quizzes...is an excellent teacher resource. The book provides quizzes for beginning readers to higher level books. With More Quizzes, I am able to quickly test the student's reading comprehension. Additionally, the teacher's manual section of the book provides helpful organizational and documentation tools."
5,"La Leggenda di Al, Jack e John","Absolutely funny movie that keeps you guessing where its going. The different Sketches, with common one liners throughout. Entertaining and will continue to watch it over and over again."
4,Pretty good,"I have dyed my hair with manic panic dye many times. Usually it turns out alot brighter when I first dye it. This was decently bright in the front, but I felt it could have been more teal and less green. Also, it lasts a long time and can give you an interesting result with fading, but it wont be as intense as Hot Hot Pink, for example."
3,a disappointment,"This product didn't last any longer than the regular Manic Panic. I have since then switched to a different brand of color which has given me better results. It's a great product if you want temporary color, and I mean 'temporary' in lasting a week or less before it washes out. It's better than Splat in that it's easier to apply and leaves my hair in better condition and smells nice, but that's about all the good I can say about it."
3,"If you want RED hair, buy the Ultra Violet.","I've used both Infra-Red and Vampire Red and they've always faded to orange on me within a few days, even after using the bleach kit.The way I've gotten my hair to stay bright red is to use a purple variant. I think the blue in it cancels out whatever makes it turn orange (granted I've got blonde hair, so it's prone to brassiness anyway).Infra Red looks GREAT for the first few days, especially if you've used the bleach kit right before. After about 3 days (if you wash your hair every day) it starts to look very faded and uncared for."
2,Non-amplified version a joke?,"Well, I've used the blue manic panic(amplified) before, it turned my hair blue for months.This time though, I bleached and dyed my hair with this non amplified pillar-box red and it faded within a week. I don't know if its this (NON-AMPLIFIED) version of the dye or if it was just really old and had been sitting on the shelf for too long. Whatever it was, My hair was pretty much orange in 2 weeks.If you're going to dye your hair red I would recommend the amplified version of this dye.I've had great results from it."
3,color,Like the manic panic line but got the amplified formula and my hair turned out neon pink. Gonna have to find something else cause I can't work with pink hair.
2,No no no,"I used to use manic panic quite often, and now I remember why I stopped. This product did nothing for my hair. I've used almost every color of manic panic, they fade very quickly.Your hair looks very bright and nice at first, but it fades quickly."
1,Barely There Color,"This color would not show up brightly on bleached hair. Even after two applications. Just turned it a strawberry blonde. If you really want a strong pink, go with a more fuchsia color."
2,Disappointed,"I bought the amplified Wildfire hair dye hoping that it would last longer than the classic wildfire. I didn't notice ANY difference at all. It faded to orange in less than two weeks (washing every other day, in cold water, with sulfate free shampoo.)On the plus side, Manic Panic is easy to apply, washes off skin easily, and usually even washes out of clothing.I was really hoping that it would last longer, because I love the just-dyed wildfire color. No such luck. I've sinced switched from using Manic Panic to using Special Effects. The difference is astounding, my special effects-dyed red hair has lasted, without noticable fading, for three weeks and counting now. It does stain skin, but I'm willing to deal with that since it means I don't have to redye my hair every two weeks!"
1,IT'S PINK!,i've been using Manic Panic for 5+years.i loved the original version of vampire red very much it faded to a beautiful orange then to ginger and back to blonde.well when i bought this hoping for a longer lasting color.i left the color in for about 3 hours.i would've left it in longer but i did not have the time.the color was beautiful at first.exactly what i wanted but after a few washes i realized instead of the orange to ginger shade the original formula gave me it was leaving me with a rose color that is now fading to a pastel pink.although the color is vibrant and pretty even with it fading to pink i'm very disappointed that i'm now going to stuck with pink ends for the remainder of my pregnancy since i can not bleach out the pink.THIS DYE IS PINK BASED! IT WILL WASH OUT PINK! UNLESS YOU'RE PREPARED FOR THE WORK AND MONEY IT WILL COST TO REMOVE THE PINK DON'T BUY! GO FOR THE ORIGINAL FORMULA.IT'S CHEAPER AND IT'S A BETTER COLOR
2,Perfect color but barely lasted 2 weeks.,"I'm a natural Brunette. I bleached my hair a month earlier so that i could go purple. I picked Purple Haze because it was the perfect color purple that i wanted. I got the amplified, which is supposed to make it last longer and what-not. I left the product in my hair for over 6 hours and it came out perfect the first time around. There wasn't enough product for all of my thick hair so i only did the under layer. During the first rinse i rinsed until the water was clear but every shower i took after that for the week after i could just see more and more purple come out. By the end of the week it had already started to fade to a pale purple. Half a week after that it looked more of a dirty purplish blonde that wasn't appealing.I loved the color, and i know that's it's only temporary. But i wish that i hadn't wasted the time, honestly. Or the money. Especially since it only really lasted a couple of days."
2,Almost gone after one wash.,"The dye itself is very nice; it goes on neatly, it doesn't itch, it doesn't smell bad and it made my hair feel great. However, none of that matters when it doesn't yield results. I only used one of the little tubs, so maybe I would have had better luck using more dye. I left it in for about three hours total and my hair turned out a nice light pink. Because I didn't have enough dye, there was still quite a bit of blonde visible but it looked fine. Unfortunately, the first time I washed it, almost all of the pink came out. The top of my hair by the roots and my bangs stayed a very light pink and the rest was a vaguely pink tinted blonde. While it was still a fun look, it wasn't what I was intending or what the product was supposed to do; it's marketed as a dye, not a tint. I'm definitely using a different brand next time."
2,It was... Meh.,I got it a couple weeks ago and left it in my roots for an hour. I swear it was half washed out after the first wash 2 days later. A week after and my roots were nothing more than tinted pink. Highly disappointed. I think I'll stick with N'Rage :/
3,"beautiful color, but doesnt last.","The good thing about this product is that the color is a very pretty bright light turquoise blue. It goes really good in-between layers of black and green. (This is what I used it for, it looked very nice!)Now there are a few bad things about this product also. The color only lasted me maybe 3-5 washes and I had the color cream stay on my hair for an extra 10-20 minutes (as my hair takes forever to take color.) And I even added a low heat!It really is a beautiful color, just doesn't stay in long enough for a busy teen."
5,You want white? This is white.,"One thing you should NOT do is use the Manic Panic lifter. I did that, and the color was perfect, but my hair broke off that very day. This stuff, however, with Clairol Born Blond Maxi, is great! It's a perfect toner, you can use it to lengthen the life of your OTC dye job. I put it on wet hair, then blow dry it and then rinse it out. It's a good week of blindingly white, then you can refresh, or just go till you next dye (less ""virgin snow"" and more ""old snow bank"". It doesn't damage hair that I can tell, and I've gone through two or three jars of it in the last year. I have short, fine hair and I get about 4-5 applications from a jar."
1,Did not get *Amplified* Longer Lasting version from E Shop LLC (fulfilled by Amazon),"I recently ordered & received the Ultra Violet Manic Panic hair color cream and aside from the shipping label - it says 'Amplified' no where on the jar. If you have researched this product via ManicPanic.com, as I did - you can see many product packaging shots that show a difference between the standard color and the 'Amplified' version.In the photo for this product, even though the ""Amplified"" isn't on the main label - there is a giant sticker on the lid that says 'Amplified' - My jar did NOT have this either.This was purchased specifically because I wanted their longer lasting formula.I am not sure if I simply received the wrong item or if this is product misrepresentation.I have contacted E Shop LLC and am awaiting response. Will update if/when they contact me - but if you need for a specific event or need it quickly, be wary!"
4,THIS IS NOT A DYE PPL ITS A TONER LEARN TO READ,it pulls the orange pigment out of your hair into a lovely light color xDmy hair was a wheat color now its silverish will buy again
5,Electric Lizard!,"I had my dark brown hair lightened (highlights, not whole head) professionally and re-did the green myself with Manic Panic Amplified Electric Lizard. I love it!Check out Manic Panic's web site for some really good tips.You MUST have pre-lightened hair to get the color in the jar. My hair was lightened down to nearly white before I did this.I used foil to separate out the hair and a tint brush to apply - I also strongly advise using gloves. Soft Scrub removed from the sink any drips of green.Also, be sure to protect your hairline / ears with petroleum jelly or your skin will stain.I let the dye set for 2 hours, and the color is lasting great."
2,Looked awesome but gone after 3 weeks,"I used the flash lightning bleach kit (which worked great) and then the purple haze hair color. I left it in for an hour. I washed it out and it looked bright and fabulous! Shocking color, exactly what I wanted. But I was so bummed that it faded noticeably each shampoo afterward. And the first week it was rubbing off on my shirt collars and my pillow case (but that came out easily enough in the laundry). Three weeks later, nothing but blonde. I still have half a bottle but I don't think I'll use it, for the mess it makes on my clothes and sheets, and the effort of dying it again. A friend of mine had some pink streaks (on blonde hair) that lasted MONTHS. Apparently pink has smaller particles that latch onto the hair a little better. I'll try that next time."
3,Get's EVERYWHERE.,"I love the color that it gave me, it's gorgeous!! BUT It get's all over your skin, which I have yet to get it all off, gets all over your shower everytime you wash your hair it looks like somebody has just sprayed blood all over your shower and it's just awful. I really don't like that part."
2,Pillar Box Red is the worst red I've used,"I've had bright red hair off and on for almost 7 years now, so I've used just about every brand I could find trying to find the best one. Manic Panic is not it.My hair was platinum blonde, perfect for any color, after leaving this color on for several hours (since it's not like box dyes it's safe to do that, and you'll get better results) the color was dull and dingy, I can't put my finger on it but it was not RED. It was rusty and peach-ish and only lasted one wash before it faded to a disgusting burnt peach color. I believe I applied this 5 different times over the period of 2 months and got the same result every time, gross dull color that washed out after a week.A few people told me my hair was too processed to hold color, which I was ready to accept - but I just triedCreative Image Adore Crimson 68and BAM! My hair is CRAZY bright red, soft, and shiny! So there's definitely better options out there.I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
3,It washes off :/,I followed the instructions and the dye washed off too quickly :( One or two washes and that was it. I moved to another brand
2,NOT PERMANENT,"I have light brown hair and bleached one streak of it with the intention of using Manic Panic's Amplified Infra Red dye. Such a chore, the color fades within a week leaving me with an orange streak. The bold red lasts for 2-4 days and then quickly fizzles.Tried using it on clean hair, dirty hair, and varied amounts of time. Leaving it in for an hour instead of the recommended 15-30 minutes helped it last closer to 4 days.I didn't use a ""dye-neutral"" shampoo/conditioner, just stuck with my old ones, which could be a contributing factor. Still, ""2 months"" vs one week is ridiculous."
1,Ultra Violet.,"My hair was a light auburn colour, all this dye did was turn it dark brown.. I at least expected it to show a little cause my hair was pretty light. Nothing! Two hours I left it in. I might make one more attempt."
1,NOT RED. PINK,"i bleached my hair from dark brown. it came out really orange, but i thought whatever im just dying dark red over it. but when i used this product, ""manic panic amplified vampire red"" it came out pink. like magenta pink! its not at all what i wanted for my hair. now i have to go to the store and get something better. i am really dissapointed. i would not recommend this product if you want red hair."
4,Nice product texture,"But even on my bleached highlights, this color did not take too well. I think it would only work if you have really white bleached out hair. I dont want to go that far, as I have dark hair. But the thick gel is easy to use, and Manic Panic is , to me, the best as far as crazy colors go.If you have very light/blond/white hair, this will be great for you to add streaks or a whole head of great pink hair!"
4,manic panic beware,"i bought manic panic for the first time recently. i have been using permanent haircolor for 15 years and my hairdresser recommended using semi permanent color to avoid hair damage.i applied it according to instructions but left it on for two hours instead of the 15-30 minute suggestion. the color is bold, i love it - just what i wanted. here's the bummers: it is the messiest stuff i have ever used! i used vasoline on my hairline and ears and it still dyed them. my shower curtain liner is now the color of the dye just from rinsing. i had to quickly scrub the calking and grout with bleach as the dye stuck to that too. my hands are dyed from the rinsing stage, so is my neck. i'm sure it will fade soon though.my advice is to do the whole process in a backyard and rinse with a gardenhose...or rent a hotel room and let housekeeping deal with it.hope this is useful to somebody"
2,Bad Hair Dye,"Bad. I have dark brown hair and it said if I didn't bleach my hair it would at least give a highlighted look. NOTHING showed up. I dyed the same bit like THREE times and nothing showed up. I finally decided to bleach parts of my hair and the color showed up, but I had to do it multiple times just to get it to have an even color. The dye itself is way too watery so it's hard to apply and make stay. It fades very quickly and is just not worth it. I was not happy with the results..."
3,Just OK,"I am a long time user of Manic Panic, have had Purple Haze hair for years. When I wanted a change, I thought I'd give Vampire Red a try. I was rather disappointed in it. The color is not nearly as vibrant as most of the Manic Panic shades, it's more of a bloody red/brown color (hence the name, I suppose) and as it fades, it fades to a really unpleasant rusty iron looking color. It faded much quicker than other amplified shades I have used over the years.As a Dye Hard, I would not recommend this shade, and certainly not to someone wanting to experience Manic Panic for the first time."
1,Doesn't work,"I've been dying my hair for about 15 years, this isn't my first alternative color either. Absolutely nothing happened. No joke. It said let sit for 30 min, I let it sit for near 2 hours. Total bulls***"
3,Shocking Blue turned pink,"I have dyed my hair a couple of times, but this was my first time using a ""crazy"" color. First off, I bleached my dyed red hair, to a yelllowy blond. Then came time to apply the dye... I evenly applied the Shocking Blue dye to my longish thick hair and used 1 1/2 jars. I covered it with a plastic bag, applied heat, and waited about an hour. I washed the dye out and dried my hair. My hair was a purple/dark blue color. Sort of a royal blue. I expected the purple tones to wash out within a couple of washes, except the exact opposite happened. All of the blue washed out and I was left with an Atomic Violet color. Fast forward about 3 washes later and my hair had turned a lovely magenta color! I gave 3 stars because I didn't get the blue I wanted, but I do have a beautiful purple-pink color that is still going strong after about a month."
5,Daughter loves it!,"Although this is semi-permanent, it lasted a long time. Also, it goes a long way. Love the bright color, not over the top."
5,Strong stuff!,"Definitely brighter and longer-lasting than the original Manic Panic line, but just as easy to use. Nice stuff, worth the additional money if you're planning to have your color in for a while."
5,Great fun with colors!,"Manic Panic is the only non-permanent dye I am using now, after trying a few. It's vibrant, strong and lasts for quite a while. You need to be very careful, though, while you are applying it - it's very easy to stain bathroom surfaces (or clothes).I don't bleach my hair prior to dying, as I want just strong highlights. I leave it on over the night, under plastic wrap and a warm hat. I love the dark purple shade! In the sun it looks fiery :)"
3,Hair Color,It didn't last very long but we are going to try again to see if we can get better results.
2,Disappointed,"I am extremely disappointed with this product. The color was not bright green it was like dark puke green. I cant blame this entirely on the color though, I did not bleach my hair because it was light brown/blond. Also the bottle looks huge in the picture, in reality the bottle is like as tall as my pinky. Overall I was not pleased, I will retry it tomorrow."
1,INCONSISTENT PRODUCT,"This product left some of my hair an awful brassy blonde, transformed some of it into the beautiful white that you seek, and then was kind enough to put large lavender patches in my hair. I wouldn't recommend it at all. It was so mismatched that I had no choice but to ditch my blonde hair, which is now incredibly hard to dye over because of said awful product."
1,WORST HAIR DYE EVER!!!,"This hair dye is just awful! Don't even think to use it.I have a lot of experience dying my hair in crazy bright colors, with all kind of stuffs and different techniques, and this one is the worst ever.After I bleached my hair and did everything it said in th instructions,my hair wasn't even close to the color it was supposedly to be.I tried several times, with pink, turquoise, blue and purple and the only one that worked a little bit was the purple but everything washed off at the next day when I washed my hair; and I got a totally awful blond from the previous bleached.If you want to dye your hair, use JEROME RUSSEL PUNKY COLOR because after trying a lot of other products this one is the only one that worked with a great color, for a month without any fading and making my hair nice and soft."
5,Great Color,"The color of this was great. Even on my non-bleached hair.Just a few things to consider...It doesn't damage your hair, so you can leave it on forever. At least six hours, but many people sleep in it. My hair was only half red though, but my hair wasn't bleached so it didn't surprise me. It was just a simple way to see if I wanted to permanently dye my hair. Which I do! after this great color."
4,Not quite what i remember...,"I had used Manic Panic hair dye back in middle school (Hot Hot Pink) and since i hadn't lightened my natural brown hair, it turned a really nice shade of burgundy. I sort of expected a similar result with Midnight Blue, but my hair wasn't exactly ""virgin."" I had tried blue dye of another brand, with disastrous results, and put this colour on top. It came out a dark blue-green, which was a little disappointing but still pretty. I like it enough to do it again. It would probably show up more like the first time I'd ever used it if i drained all the dye out."
3,Fair bike for the money,Some of the bike parts are cheap but what do you want in a bike less than $200.00. My only complaint is that the shifter is to hard or stiff to shift gears. My twin girls (I bought two of these bikes) cannot change gears from high gears to low. I have to do it for them. Pacific needs better shifters. What good are gears if you can't use them? The bike seat also needs to be upgraded to a better unit.
3,It works,"I ordered this bike for my 8 yr. old daughter. She likes the colors. Unfortunately, it arrived without a bike seat. We had to order another bike just to get the seat. Fortunately, Amazon paid for the return shipping. It seems a bit heavy for a small childs bike. The gears are hard to turn for my daughter. However, she loves riding her new bike."
5,bike,"This is really a beautiful bike. Only problem is the packaging. The front wheel is placed at the side of the frame, zip tied in place where the axle RUBS the frame BADLY. Amazon replaced it at no charge, and the replacement had the EXACT same problem. Now i must give it as a gift with no time left to get another."
4,Nice looking bike,Bought this for my 8 year old daughter. It's a little big for her but she handles it well. The handle grip shifting is a bit hard for her to manage so she uses it as a single speed for now. Bike was easy to assemble and looks very nice.
3,You get what you pay for,"This is a disposable bike. You can't knock the price, but don't expect a whole lot of bang for your buck.In its favor, it comes almost completely assembled, so it only took 5-10 minutes to finish setting it up. Well...not exactly, read on.The brakes needed lots of adjustment, both front and back. That's expected, I guess. But the levers are fairly hard to pull. Again, we're talking about a pretty cheap bike here. The shifter, though, is really bad. Out of the box, it wouldn't shift into the highest two gears. After some adjustments I got it working OK, but my daughter doesn't even have the arm strength to change gears yet.Lastly, this bike is heavy. I'm sure this bike is perfect for some -- if I were a kid with no bike at all, I'd take this in a second. If you've got a tiny bit more money to spend, you'll have fewer headaches and a much happier kid in the end. Do yourself a favor and go to a bike shop."
3,good company/mediocre product,"when it works, its great, but the battery cap fits loosely, so you have to work it around to get contact, like a really old flashlight. the company was quick and it arrived in short time. amazon should indicate country of manifacture for better buying decision"
5,Just right,"I was pleased with this purchase. The spoons are not as lightweight and cheap as their price might imply, and they are the perfect size to work with a soft-boiled egg. Made the whole experience much more pleasant."
4,Just right,"These spoons are just the right size for eggs, even my husband is happy with them. If you enjoy soft boiled eggs, these spoons are a must."
3,"Good product, but...","The spoons are nice, but could be a little heavier. They're Stainless Steel, but not that great a quality. I'm pleased, but not ecstatic."
2,Cheap looking,"I bought these egg spoons for an upcoming holiday breakfast at our house. But these spoons do not look great. Right out of the package every handle had a discoloration problem and/or slight scuff marks. The design itself could be pretty with the brushed look, but in reality not so much. I am not sure whether this is due to quality control or simply because the material is only 18/8 stainless steel vs. better quality 18/10 or 18/12. The handle edges are also not nice and rounded but rather unpleasantly hard and sharp to the touch.I will keep them simply because I need them in a few short days and have no time to reorder something nicer. But if anyone is considering these, look elsewhere. Even at the cheap price they are not worth it."
3,OK egg spoons,"They are fine for what they are. I would hate to put them out for company b/c they are just not a quality product. Do we use them at home, yes... but just for us.They do the job for which they were intended."
3,could be better,I find the spoons too shallow to do a good job. They could also use a little bit longer handle. It does the job but it could be better. One is always looking for price versus performance and perhaps I should have paid a little more and gotten something better.
2,Much thinner stainless steel than expected,"I think the photo's are a little misleading as by the appearence I was expecting at least a medium weight stainless steel, while it is actually thin, making it less comfortable to handle and less comfortable in the mouth."
4,No problem in eating eggs with these spoons,My opinion for the previous critical reviews:1. The shape of the spoons is not awkward.2. The stainless steel is not too thin.
5,Could have been just the Shootist for me.,"In the Shootist, John Wayne is really believable as the worn out cowboy. I think Lauren Bacall is beautiful. The scenes seem to flow with the good acting.I fell asleep for the other two movies. I'd seen part of Liberty Valance before but did not like the confusing structure of it. The premise I read of Katie Elder sounded interesting."
1,I hate John wayne,"I hate John Wayne and only ordered this because my wife wanted to see it. It came quickly and in excellent condition. Wayne named names during the Hollywood witch hunts. A poor thing for a supposed artist to do. I can only guess the FBI had something on him that threatened his career, maybe his real life didn't match his macho movie image. He couldn't act, anyway, and only got his Oscar out of pity. So, that's why I hate John Wayne."
2,It didn't work!,"I had a very hight hope for this product before I bought it, it ended up very disappointed. I had to use the hack saw to cut the nipple in half to get it out and it only took less than 15 min. I gave it 2 stars because of the fast shipping."
4,Not exactly....,"As much as I love all these artists but this recording is overblown and not idiomatic at all. I love Nilsson as Turandot, Isolde, Brünnhilde and in several Strauss-operas but I don't like her Tosca which is not idiomatic, too loud and too Brünnhilde-like. It's not bad, mind you, but it's far from ideal. Listen to the prayer where gentleness is demanded... There she sounds like Isolde too... And Fischer Dieskau is completely miscast as Scarpia. Wrong sound, wrong style and bad Italian... Go for his Lieder-Recordings to see why he was great. Corelli is on fire as Cavaradossi but I prefer to hear him with Tebaldi and Callas. (Both live from the Met) So, not a bad recording, but not essential. Go for the de Sabata recording with Callas or de Karajan recording with Price instead."
3,Tosca - Passionate Opera That's Just So-So,"Blah. That's about all I can say. I love La Birgit, and Fischer-Diskau has a lovely voice, but neither of them are cut-out for Italian opera, as is evident in this recording.Yes, the voices are fine, the production admirable, but the sound is just lacking. If you're looking to buy this just as a fan of the this particular cast, it's a fine addition to your collection. If you're looking for a real, lush, evocative Tosca, try the Caballe/Carerras/Ramey cast."
4,Loved it,"I read this after already reading ""When She is Bad"" which is my absolute favorite book and this one just as great. I love how love and happily ever after is just out of reach until the very end. Also, love how much detail Leanne puts into her writing!"
3,readable but not a favorite,This was one book i was able to put down. The story line did not appeal to me. Katie needs to find a man for her boss's daughter only the daughter runs off to Texas. And that's about all that happens. It was readable but not a favorite.
5,Dragon NS V8,"We have a family member with an autism spectrum disorder and dysgraphia (a learning disability.) We tried earlier versions, and they were awful. We probably wouldn't have considered buying Dragon NS again until we had a session with the OT staff at UIHC's Center for Disabilities. We tried V8 during the visit, and there's no comparison. It's just that much better. I would agree that the headset isn't as good (as the one we had from the earlier version,) but that's really an insignificant detail. Buy this because you need the software. Hardware issues can be easily resolved."
5,Speech Rec that WORKS!!,"Ok, I've used Dragon since v5 - this one FINALLY works as advertised. I trained it for 4 minutes and it is amazing. You need to check on the NY Times review - stellar. The video demo by the NY Times shows you now have to TRY to get the thing to make a mistake. If you have a doctor, lawyer or writer in the family, this will make a great holiday gift!"
1,Beware Customer Service,"They refused to enable the software to my disabled mother. I was told to fax the UPC code from the bottom of the box in order to get the software operational on my disabled mother's new computer. Although I successfully faxed the information to them according to the transmission report on the fax machine, they told me they never received it. Phone calls to them resulted in no action. Now my quadripalegic mother cannot access anything on her computer. Beware poor customer service!"
1,Not for e-mailing or Internet,"Beware of the word ""Most"". It is advertised as working with most Windows programs. But it will not type text into Internet Explorer or Outlook Express! Two of the most widely used Windows programs. As a quadriplegic, I have been using almost all versions of Dragon NaturallySpeaking and they have worked fine. When I finally was able to contact technical department, I was told that there was no workaround or fix for this bug. The only thing that you can do is use cut and paste, as I am doing here."
1,Worst possible software.,"What makes it so bad? It takes a bunch of your time before you realize its a ""no go."" So you are out much more than the original cost....I try Dragon every few years to see if it is finally living up to its promise. In the past, I have just been disappointed with its accuracy. This time, it installed and seemed to work for a few weeks before telling me it had become ""corrupted"" and would not reinstall. So I have wasted all the time I have spent ""training"" the program. Tech support was its usual additional waste of time, and a long distance phone call. Order this only if you consider your time of little value..."
3,Cheap Headset,"This could have been a very useful product. I had about 1.5 hours in reading for voice accuracy. I needed to spend more time reading but I did not get the chance. THE HEADSET BROKE. This is not a comfortable headset. It is very tight and bulky. I am not a big person and found it uncomfortable. I have sent back for a refund. When they get a lighter weight headset I will probably buy the more inexpensive version of Dragon Speaks. When using it in Excel it was faster to click in the cells with my mouse vs. saying ""Tab""."
1,awful,"I read all the reviews that say it was great. I had no problem loading the product. I went through the training.Do not be fooled this product does not work.Maybe you have to talk for a 100+ hours I don't know, but if you think in a couple of hours this will work, think again.I don't know where everyone else lives that bought this product and said it worked, they cannot be from Massachusetts.I could not get this product to even type Hi, it would type i.It could not get the simple words, forget about the tough or long words. I have been through Toastmasters and speech classes so I have learned how to pronounce my ""R""'s and speak so I can be understood."
1,"Too many problems, very weak support","As of today (12/14/2004) DNS 8 is NOT ready for distribution. There are simply too many problems. It may install for you and it may not install. If it does install, great--rumor has that it works well. If it does not install . . . well, you're on your own. There isn't any real support, and the product has not been out long enough to get a lot of assistance from the online community.Some day it might be a ""must have,"" but today I'd have to rate it a ""don't bother."""
2,it needs work,"it works most of the time. but it did not work good enough for the money. I payed for the program it needs some more work, but I think in the future. They'll fix the problem but until then, all work with it. but I got no hard feelings I'll try again to buy new one in about a year or two it may work better"
2,Falls short of promise--again,"DNS has always been promising and always falls short of its promise in practice. I have a powerful machine, lots of memory, and it still freezes up on me. It often fails to recognize commands in MS Word 2003, although it does better in its own Dragon Pad; it looks like it wasn't really adapted to Word 2003. Tech support is terrible. DNS 8 is supposed to be much more accurate than 7, but I haven't found it so. Save your money."
4,Me and Charlie M.,"Thank you for sending me my new friend -- Charlie M. Remember that famous dummy, Charlie McCarthy? That's how MY Charlie got his name. He is writing this message for me right now.He's also helping me to write a book, and making that task so much easier -- and way more fun!The only reason Charlie did not get a five-star rating from me, is that he still aggravates me sometimes, when he won't obey commands or understand my garbled speaking. But I love him anyway, and we're becoming dear friends.In fact, my husband is so intrigued by this new relationship, that I've decided to buy him his very own Charlie, for his birthday coming up soon. That way, we can both engage our own Charlies at the same time!Well, Charlie and I are off to write the next chapter in The Book. Thanks again, whoever invented him.Eve"
5,Returning Customer,"I've use voice recognition software for the last five years or so, with the first 3 to 3 1/2 years using Dragon and the last year and a half or so using Microsoft Office's bundled software. This version has brought me back into the Dragon fold. The accuracy is simply amazing, and it really is near perfect. Definitely worth the investment."
4,Walking Miracle,"I like the Dragon Naturally Speeking 8.0. Moving up from 5.0 is quite an improvment.Much more accurate though it is still learning my voice patterns,Consise speeking is a must, But a GOD send when you are in need of a left elbow replacement.Just remember to put the mic to sleep before you sneeze or you will give the software a real migraine"
1,Dim Echo,"The movie, Echo Lake, sounded intriguing to me as I had spent several summers as a child at a place called Echo Lake, California. I envisioned a foreboding lake with bodies going over the side of boats and thunder cracking across a white-capped, sinister mass of water. I frankly didn't stay awake long enough to be able to say what the plot of this movie is about. The beginning dialog was unintelligible and the characters were ""deadly"" all right, as in deadly dull. The action seemed to center on men getting in and out of cars - but I could be wrong. I'm hoping someone else likes the title of this movie as much as I did and buys the DVD at my next garage sale."
3,what I wrote when it came out..,"The leftwinger in Unnatural Selection is Rosa Luxembourg, a cockroach named after the subject of a book she ate through in her larval stage. In this Kafkaesque farce, Numbers, the narrator, and his friends are all cockroaches. Numbers read The Iliad as an infant. Others weren't so lucky: 'We held an annual commemoration for the many lost in Gravity's Rainbow and Finnegans Wake.' These well-educated insects negotiate a host of dangers as they anxiously observe the humans that also inhabit their New York apartment. The chapter entitled The Assassination of Rosa Luxembourg chronicles the swallowing of Rosa by Ira, the human owner of the apartment. The story of how the community scotch Ira's romance with a fastidious woman is daring, readable and funny. The dustjacket states that the book was considered too controversial to publish in the US."
4,An excellent intro to the game of chess,"Chess in a Nutshell is a concise and readable introduction to chess. It deals with the very basics before giving the reader a taste of some of the most common opening moves and basic strategies. Chess is by no means a game that one can learn overnight, and one should not expect to become a Bobby Fischer after reading Chess in a Nutshell, but it is no doubt one of the best books out there for the beginner."
2,Couldn't Crack It,"I pseudo like the book, Chess in a Nutshell, although I'm still a little confused about which way the donkey moves. Whenever I play with someone, I always keep my book close by. I sleep with it under my pillow. I like the instructions and diagram on page 53. However, I think that I rated it a two stars because that is the number of times I won after playing all of the people in my family tree."
5,Erudite and entertaining,"Feminists should be grateful. If the neo-conservative MCP backlash lot had found this material they would have taken a hatchet to it. Eller does a gentle demolition job. She has a rapier-like wit. Her most effective weapon is the quotation, which she often uses to deadly and hilarious effect. Prehistory will never be the same."
3,Chauvinism is Chauvinism no matter what gender you are!,"Busting a feminist myth of a blissful utopian time when women where once free and life was a ""golden age"" is a good thing! I am sure the Matriarchal had its share of problems. But reducing all evidence of a Matriarchal Prehistory to myth is chauvinism no matter what gender you are!Although she does jump from subject to subject, Eller is clever in her weaving and deconstruction of a Matriarchal Prehistory she should be, she's an established scholar but insulting our intelligence with oversimplication doesn't serve her analysis well. Deconstructing an extreme (a Matriarchal utopia, ""golden age"") by going to the other extreme is the same side of the coin.Shame on you!"
5,Woolly headed no more!,"Eller's few detractors have missed the point. This book will clear up any lingering desires you may have for the bogus, gift-shop ""spirituality"" that keeps women trapped into idealized femininity, when what they really want and deserve is knowledge and insight into their own condition. I applaud Eller's dry-eyed analysis (and it is frequently hilarious, too)."
1,Pitifully Ignorant,This book is pitifully ignorant of human history not to mention spirituality. See the work of Marija Gimbutas and Heide Goettner-Abendroth for further explanation.
1,Rubbish!,"I was very dissappointed in ""scholarly"" work and also in the very evidently biased, cynical tone of her writing. Not every woman who believes a matriarchal society is a feminist . Some of us are just well educated Anthropologists/Historians who know she isn't worth whatever money she scrapes up from the misogynistic phallus worshipping patriarchal society she has obviously came to know and love. ""Glaring ignorance"" should be listed on her credentials."
1,Very Sad....,"Well quite honestly I think that this book is "" bad "". There has been much evidence from researchers to support the truth of Matriartical cultures. However I guess since a male dominated Patriartical society has done a good job at distorting and destroying ancient Goddess evidence people have a hard time believing what is clearly in front of their eyes. The sadder part is that it is written by a woman, but I guess that when you are afraid of your own herstory and women's empowerment it is easy to support writtings that add to one's egotistical and false assumptions. All I can say is that if you are a TRUE Goddess woman you would be better to spend your time reading books like The Great Cosmic Mother which speaks of women's cultures and destruction by Patriarchy. The only real illusion here is the false notion that Patriarchy has always ruled. How very sad for everyone."
3,its ok,"it is a beautiful watch, but it is HUGE. i bought it for my husband as a wedding present since he loves skeleton watches, but it is so large that he only wore it for a week and i don't blame him. they should have a picture so a person can understand just how huge the watch face is. im very disappointed in the size, yet it is a beautiful watch. i admire it on our dresser everyday."
5,Wonderful series!,"Julie Garwood has always been a favorite author of mine. I read this series years ago and wanted to read it again, I enjoyed it ust as much the second time!"
3,"One pink, one white, and one red rose!","I thoroughly enjoyed For The Roses- and went straight to the library to find these three smaller books. Their length did not bother me. But they seemed a little shallow. I did enjoy the story for One White Rose. It's the best to me. The others seemed silly and unrealistic, especially One Red Rose. I am glad I read them because I would always have been curious about them. I do wish they have mentioned more of Mary Rose and Harrison."
2,Not at all what I expected.,"Normally I do not read historical romance, but after ""For The Roses"", I was almost frantic to get my hands on this book. Not only did I find Julie Garwoods ""One Pink Rose"" a disappointment, I felt the same way about ""One Red Rose"" and ""One White Rose"". After the time and attention she paid to all of her characters and their relationships in ""For The Roses"", the other books were quick/rushed. I was also upset by the fact that Momma Rose had little or no part in the lives of her children once she was able to be with them. The characters acted as if she never arrived and they were still corresponding via mail."
1,Julie dropped the ball on this series,"First I want to say I usually love Julie Garwood books, but this entire series was the worse books I have ever read. It seems like she wrote them when she was in fifth grade. Story line, manner of writing and relations ships, were all just thrown together to get some books in the stores. A total waste of time unless you are 9 years old and reading your first romance."
4,Rockin,"Excellant sophmore effort by this band of funk and soul masters from Long Island. The song writing is better than ever, and the band is tight. My favorite song is the title track, Silver Flower. I have seen this band a bunch a times, and it is always a great show. Circus Mind rocks."
5,Peg Perego Aria OH,"I love this stroller ( it is my second one)!!! Light weight, easy to push, love the new cup holder, my son loves the freedom harness. The harness is not meant to attach to the back of the seat, so your child can see out better and move more. No problem turning the wheels. I could see you having problems if you were in rocks or off road, but the stroller is not for that use. I would recommend it and have to 2 of my friends."
1,poor design for the brand big name,"Pegperego, I was so trill when I bought this stroller . it's very light, has nice design and color choices. But then my excitement only last for a month, after several usage, the front wheel is so hard to controlled, it goes not according to which direction we want but wherever it likes. I used to be able to control the stroller with one hand, but now, I need to lift the from part up just to get the stroller going to the direction I want . Poor design for $200 bug and pegperego big name... The should take this stroller out of the market. I better used my big secure Graco product...."
2,"Was OK for 6 months, then gave it away","I was so excited to get this stroller for my 18 month old. I'd been using a Graco that was just too big once I didn't need the carseat-to-stroller feature anymore. This stroller was great for a few weeks, then started to feel like it was going to fall apart... Two weeks ago, on my daughter's 2nd birthday, I gave it away and am back shopping the market for a stroller. Bummer."
5,Worth three times the price!,"I did not buy this book to pass the Microsoft exam - I just needed something to explain to me why Windows NT Workstation was doing some of the things on my system that it was. A friend of mine who was studying for the exam suggested I get this book, and I did.Not only do I understand NT a whole lot better than I did after reading other books, but I understand more of how NT interacts with everything else - particularly NetWare servers and Dial-up networking.I would buy this book again in a heartbeat, and plan on buying others in the series."
5,"200 Proof, Pure Grain NT Workstation","If you've ever seen a large sponge that someone has sucked all the water from and seen how small it can get and still be a sponge, then you understand the premise of what is here. All the other NT Workstation books have had the fluff sucked from them to make this book - what is left has no wasted space/thoughts/text."
2,the same book by another name,"Beware. This is the same book as Thames and Hudson's ""Return to Chauvet Cave: Excavating the Birthplace of Art--The First Full Report,"" published in London. The British version seems to be available quite a bit cheaper, perhaps because the Thames and Hudson editions of book like this tend to get remaindered and are easier to find in used-book stores. So on price grounds I can't really recommend the US edition."
4,Beautiful,I haven't read much yet. I've been too busy browsing through the pictures. Beautifully detailed. Amazing how this art was created by people that we think of as primitive. There has always been a need of humans to express themselves through art.
3,Unwired,"Not a bad product, but the technical data claims this item has 38 sub codes, which it seems to not have. Kind of misleading on the technical description."
2,"Yes, NO privacy codes!",They just copied description of 8082 which has privacy codes. I just returned the radios after finding they have no privacy codes. There is much difference between with or without privacy codes.
3,kind of good,"the push to talk button doesn't work well on this unit, causes transmitter to break in and out."
3,Whats my name?,"Overall, I like this product. I have tried it both inside and outside of the house and on the road. I guess I was hoping for a little more range out of it. They are pretty lightweight and the looks arn't bad. I couldn't quite get the 2 miles range that it says it has. But hey for this price you can't beat em'. They are simple and easy to use, a good buy. It was coolBig Truck"
2,Read the reveiws before you buy,"I didn't read the review until after I bought one. They don't have the privacy channels, channel scan or VOX that the screen originally said. Also the ""up to 2 miles"" range has a useful range of closer to 1/2 mile with fresh batteries. It is OK for around the house and maybe the mall but don't expect too much at the amusement park. Without the extra privacy channels you will get many people on the 14 channels.Once again, Read the reviews before you buy."
5,Cutting Edge Treatment of Religion and Social Science,"Sociologists have been waiting a long timefor something like this. Though the sociologyof religion has come a long way, works thatunpack the religious and philosophicalassumptions of sociology have been fewand far between. Besides Peter Berger's Rumorof Angels and Robert Bellah's Beyond Belief,I'm not sure that anything comes as close asMoral, Believing Animals in laying the groundworkfor a dialogue between religion and social science."
4,Recommended for toning,"This is a great DVD for toning! You can tailor your workout to what areas of your body you want to focus on. There's 5 different 10 minute segments to choose from. I always finish with Sleek and Stretch which feels great. I really feel it after and feel much better instantly! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the Total Body Blast segment involves some moves and transitions that take some time to get into and the transition is a little quick for me to keep up with. Great, quick work out!"
5,Quick results,Great for people who don't have an extra hour in the morning to exercise. I saw results in a little over a week!
3,Prefer other 10 min pilates same instructor,"I am probably an intermediate level of fitness. Not a bad workout, but liked the moves on the other 10 minute solution Pilates DVD by the same instructor better."
4,"Some easy, some hard","I like this video because it can be challenging yet some are pretty easy. I like that you can do a short workout or a long one. It's very easy to follow also. Don't overdo it the first few times, you'll hurt!"
4,Serious Pilates,"Like most people, I have the best intentions to start and continue an exercise program. I have to admit that I've only tried the dvd once. I attempted to do the 10 min ab portion. It is much more difficult than I imagined. I only did about 2 mins of it and my muscles actually hurt for two days after. It is something you need to bulid up to but I am sure it'll deliver the results it promises."
5,Own it. Love it!,I've used this multiple times and each time I get sore muscles the next day. It's a great challenge for people of all fitness levels.
2,Disappointed,"I am a Pilates beginner (although am in decent shape from swimming, biking, running) and I first want to say that after two weeks of attempting to do the poses on this DVD I do feel a difference in my abs. But that's really it... Overall, I think I feel worse. My back hurts from some of the poses and my knees actually hurt too from some of the leg exercises. The instructer moves WAY too fast and doesn't really instruct how to do the poses properly. I think the stretching segment is the worst because it's way too fast. You end up rushing through and I feel like I'm pulling my muscles and not stretching them. I always thought that stretching should be a slower process... After about 8 times through the stretching segment, I still haven't felt ""stretched"" - just more in pain."
4,challenging,"A great workout but challenging for the common mom.Great instructor, who moves through the exercises smoothly. I still have to work on the exercises just to get them right as I'm no more the most flexible and fit person. But for athletes and people who do pilates this work-out should not be a problem.I love challenges and hope that soon I can master it.The 10 minute sequences are great, you start out just wanting to do one and then it is so much fun, that you end up doing all. But if you have to stop, it is no problem."
4,always time to work out,I can always find 10 minutes to work out once a day. Great pilates and workout video. I like how I can choose which 10minute segments I want to do with my blue ray player and it automatically plays only those segments. Been working out for years and this is a great quick addition to my workout library
4,Good experience,"Overall, this was a good purchase experience. I like the DVD, it's hard, but for all the right reasons. Highly recommend Lara's DVD's."
4,Great solution!,"I am really happy with this DVD....i can feel the results the next day for the most part. The only exercises I am not completely sold on are the leg ones...but those are my problem areas and I have always done squats and lunges in the past. Otherwise, i love this DVD...if I'm being a bum I always just tell myself...just do a 10 minute segment...and next thing you know you're doing another!! so i end up getting more workout time in. I only wish i could figure out a better way to see what she is doing so i don't have to strain my neck or keep pausing. Otherwise, i am very happy with this as an introduction to pilates!"
4,Effective!,"I've never ever done pilates, so I have to say that this was a bumpy start. She goes a little fast, so I recommend that the viewer watch the segment first and then do it. But this being nitpicky. I love the 10 minute solution series because it allows me to customize my workout and I can try new things in small amounts. The instructor is great, and the workouts themselves are productive without being painfully strenuous. The best part is that I can feel the results and I'm not bored!"
5,I Own far too many workout videos,"I have tried all the usual p90x, Sean T, 10 min trainer, turbo fire etc... I really really liked this one. Its not too advanced but still as challenging as you make it. Like all workouts, you get out what you put in. If you keep your form, and use the resistance, it will work, you will feel the burn. I would say this for a short quick boost is perfect. If you want nasty butt kicking I would go with Turbo fire. I use this at work on my down time, and I love it. I like all the 10 min solutions that I have tried thus far and this one does not let ya down."
4,10 Minute Solutions Rapid Results Pilates with Laura Hudson,"I love this DVD. I started with Marie Windsor's pilates and got good results. But, I wanted a workout that was faster paced and paid attention to my arms. I got all of this and more with Laura Hudson's Rapid Results. The workout is not overwhelming to those just starting Pilates. Even though I've been doing Pilates for several years, I still like this workout. As I become more flexible, I can perform the moves better and more effectively."
4,great for tight schedules,I am both a full time student and work full time so this workout has been great for my tight schedule. Though I was a newcomer to pilates the segments were easy to follow and I was able to catch on quickly. I had sore muscles where I didn't know I had muscles! This is great and I am already seeing benefits. Not to mention I can pick out and tailor my workout to my schedule. Buy this product!
2,Not for Beginners,"I have been working out for over 12 years and can usually follow a workout video, however I could not even follow this video for 5 minutes. I understand that Pilates involves different moves, etc... but from the other reviews on here I thought it would be fairly easy to pick up. I don't recommend this to anyone who is not already very familiar with Pilates."
2,Too complex,"I have to agree with some other reviewers that a number of moves on this DVD are unnecessarily complex. I recommend 10 Minute Solution: Pilates because you will feel the same burn with less maneuvering. There is not really a difference in the challenge level between the two DVDs. Regarding the workout on this DVD, there are new moves I haven't tried before, but I had no difficulty doing them. Like the 10 Minute Solution: Pilates DVD, I did not really feel challenged and only felt a burn during the ab workout. I've tried three different 10 Minute Solution DVDs, but I guess 10 minutes just isn't enough for me. If you are trying to lose weight, try 30-Day Shred. If you just want to maintain your shape and you are tight on time, this might be okay for you. I would not recommend this if you want to tone up your legs."
5,Love Love LOVE this DVD!!,"Working out is usually torture for me, but I actually wake up in the morning and look forward to doing these workouts. It's fun and the results are FAST! People have actually asked me how I'm in the shape I'm in!What I love most about this DVD is that the five segments are designed for a specific area or for a certain need (abs, arms, buns/thighs, cardio, and stretching) and you can mix and match, or do all five. I usually do the abs and buns/thighs segments, and end with the stretching, which is very relaxing and great way to end a workout.The instructor is great, she gives great breathing cues and makes the exercises easy to follow, even for a beginner. The workouts are fun, easy to stick to, and believe me, you'll get the results you want!"
3,OK for intermediate/advanced users,"I've worked out with Windsor pilates in the past and expected this to be at least similar. It is not at all like the Windsor pilates. This has many moves that seem to be more yoga inspired than pilates. The movements are done more quickly and not as controlled as I would like. I had not done any conditioning in several months and many of the movements I could not do at all. The instructor also does not give advise for modifications.That said, I do like the idea of choosing between several 10 minute workouts. Also, even though I did my own modifications of several movements, I still felt like I got a good workout.Overall, a good conditioning DVD if you don't have a lot of time and are already in fairly good shape already. I would not recommend it for beginners or anyone looking for a strictly Pilates workout."
4,Good for intermediate levels.,"I like this DVD alot. She has some great moves. I don't really care for the 10 minute intervals, I would prefer to stay doing pilates the entire time but for those who only have 10 minutes than I can see them liking this. The only thing she is missing is some sort of warm up. I usually walk for 30 minutes first than go directly to this DVD, works well for stretching after doing cardio."
3,Better for Begginners,I think this would be great for those who are just starting out in Pilates and who are just pressed for time because it really didn't do much for me. I like the idea of 10 min workout but I don't think it could work in real life because how could you see any change. I would recommend that you should use the whole tape just to see some change....because focusing on one part of the body is not much of a workout.Her explanations are great and her timing is great.
4,Great for beginners!,This easy workout is not only short and programmable but the movements are great for Pilates beginners. I also like how Lara Hudson doesn't drag on the movements with too many reps- instead the movements are concentrated so sets of 3 or 4 is as high as she usually goes - it's great!
4,Good work outs,This seems like it will be good once I can master all the moves. Some of it I can follow and do and some of it is challenging. I will probably keep at it. I especially like the fact the you can choose the work outs one at a time.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A fun story involving a private investigator at a magic convention trying to track someone done. Where there is a gumshoe, there is often a girl, and that is the case here.Throw in some mathematics as rules for the magic, and you have a fun book."
1,If I could go lower than 1 star I would....,"Who ever wrote this book should turn on the Discovery Channel and watch a documentary about Force Recon, his book was so horrible that it is the only book I ever burned."
5,"beautiful, good protection","This is an excellent, beautiful case. It comes with a clear backing that you gently pop the iPod into (there are seperate backings for the 30 and 80 gig iPods to ensure a perfect fit) and the face snaps on and is suspended slightly above the iPod so as to not damage the front. There are holes for the dock connector, hold switch, and headphone port that are all easily accessible. Although its not clear in the picture, the screen is covered with hard plastic and the wheel is covered by a thin plastic film which is essentially invisible. The case has a good feel to it and adds just enough bulk to the iPod so that it feels protected, but not smothered in a bulky case. The color of the brushed metal is stunning, and earned many ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" from the friends I showed it to. I've had several iPod cases in the past ranging from leather ones to rubber ""skins"" to hard plastic, and this is by far the best of any. A good buy!"
4,Pink is always in!,I've gotten lots of compliments on this case. It has a snug fit for my iPod 5G 80gb. The acrylic backing is quite thick but it still docks into the base that came with my HTiB by Panasonic. I can still use my Monster iCarPlay Wireless FM Transmitter although the plug cannot fully insert due to the thickness of the acrylic casing & snug opening. Easy to access the Hold switch & earphone jack. Love the fact that I didn't have to fuss with a squeegee screen protector or a bunch of stickers to protect the click wheel.
5,Just like a new Ipod!,"I was wondering about this case, I bought it because of all the great reviews on it. Well, I am not at all disappointed! The case fits so snugly that there is no way the scratch prone Ipod can move around at all. That is the key to protecting your investment.I love the fact that even the clickwheel is covered. I was worried it may be too thick to work properly, but I actually think it works better than without it on.My one concern is if the clear plastic on the screen will be scratchproof. I think I already managed to get a slight scratch on it. You can't see it when the ipod is on, but for someone who likes to keep things looking like new I won't be throwing this case in the bottom of my purse with my keys anytime soon.Also, the best part is that I am still able to fit the ipod in the Belkin case into my iarmbands workout case. Certainly a huge plus!"
4,Fantastic case!,"After trying several different cases, including armband cases, easel cases, etc., and subsequently leaving scratches on the back of my iPod, I was pleasantly surprised by this one.My new 80GB black iPod fits perfectly in the case, and the black looks great with the brushed pink metal. I love the plastic cover over the click wheel; the easel case I had left one long scratch when I tried to remove it once, and it's nice to have the wheel actually covered.The only downfall is that I can't seem to get my iTrip to work with the case on. I've found this with all of my cases, so I'm not too surprised. The fit just isn't snug enough to get a good connection.Other than that, however, I highly recommend this case. It's fantastic! :)"
5,"very stable, snug fit","very good fit, very good protection, price a bit high, but ok given the quality of the product"
4,Cute!,"This case covers the click wheel in clear plastic, which seems to make it a little harder to use. I found the click wheel to be awkward to start with, so this wasn't a major drawback. I have not had a problem with using headphones with it, but some devices (like the iHome and various car plug-ins) have had occasional problems staying plugged in because the case is so thick. However, the case is easy to take on and off (even with long nails!) so this has not posed a major problem. It's done a great job, my two year old ipod looks like it's brand new. It's also a gorgeous bold color of pink, which fits well with the current fashion trends!"
5,Amazing!,"This case is perfect!! I use to own a silicon case and it didn't give my ipod much protection and seemed to actually collect little fuzzies and dust. Not this ipod case! it has a perfect fit and the look and color are amazing. Its like you have the great style and color of a ipod nano with the power and luxury of a 30,60 or 80 GB ipod. I would recommend this case to anyone who is looking for a hot and fun way to protect their ipod. This has to be the best case I ever seen. Thanks Belkin!"
1,Bongo Drums,Received product and it was missing the bottoms and the wood was cracked; I am very Dissatisfied; but it would cost too much to send back. I don't recommend to all my family and friends not to do business with this company. And After several attempts to the vendor and not receiving any response back; I canceled the order and re-ordered from another vendor; upon doing this; this vendor shipped out damaged product to me and of coarse I can not return it due to it would cost more for me then to donate it.
1,dead in 2 yrs,"I bought the LT-37x688 a little over 2 years ago and the picture started having problems with darkness and ghost pixels. I just received word from an authorized repair shop that it needs a new front panel which runs $1500. The TV was $900 new. Needless to say, I'm extremely displeased and will never buy a JVC product again, and would advise any potential buyers here to look to another brand."
2,A Dry Work Under the Guise of a Novel,"This was a book that I had to read for a sociology class on Central Asia. Out professor said that we were reading it as a break from our technical reading and that it would be enjoable as it was supposedly a good novel.When I started reading this thing I found that it was nothing like a decent novel. It is simply a narrative of a handful (around 5 if I remember) character's lives and all the people they meet, things they do, etc. during a pretty interesting period of history. While the history is interesting and you can learn a lot from this book, I warn you that it is a very dry read, filled with names, dates, places, etc.Don't get this if you want an engrossing, entertaining read. That's it."
4,Great replacement grips.,"I ordered these as a gift for someone. But I have a set of these on my own pistol and they're fantastic. Replaces the factory plastic grips of the 92fs without adding any bulk or weight, but gives a much more comfortable grip. I would recommend these to anyone that owns a Beretta 92fs and wants to upgrade the standard grips to add more comfort."
1,Bad customer service,"I received the Baby Bjorn as a shower gift, we had registered for it. When our son was big enough to ride in it, I tried to put it on but the back strap had two left buckles instead of a left and a right. No problem, I thought, I'll call the customer service number on the box and they'll send me a new strap. When I called I spoke with a very rude and disinterested person who told me that I had to ship the thing back to them, pay for the shipping myself, and that it would take ""a long time"" to get the replacement. I asked him, ""So, you sell a defective product and then the customer has to pay to ship it back to you for a replacement?"" He told me that yes, that is Baby Bjorn's policy. By the way, we have a Snugli carrier that we borrowed from my sister-in-law, which we love, and it retails for about $50 less. We returned the Baby Bjorn and bought a Snugli with $$ left over."
4,Great if you have help...,"Me and my son really like the baby bjorn once we get situated in it! I am 5'7"" and I have trouble getting into it without help. Once we buckle, snap and tighten the straps, the baby falls asleep and I can do other things hands free, but its the initial getting situated that is the bothersome bit. I also dislike that I have to remove him and to nurse him which is also a pain, cause then I need someone to help me get him situated again...I will still use the carrier occasionally but I am off to try the Premaxx Adventure Sling..."
2,my aching back!,"I love the concept but the design is not great for your baby as he or she gets heavier. My daughter is now 15 lbs. and after 10 minutes walking with her in the Bjorn, my shoulders and back really hurt. Not recommended."
2,Hurts Back,I've tried this carrier and it really gave me a bachache after wearing it for a short time. Also the baby grows out of it very quickly. I love the ergo baby carrier (highest rated by users as testified on the baby bargins website) and am still using it with my 14 month old son. It can be used as both a front and back carrier and has a hip belt which is key! ergobabycarrier.com-Pam
4,Nice little unit,"We've had it for about 1/2 year now. It works as well as advertised. Considering how expensive these things used to be, this is a steal. Sure, it doesn't have riveting stereo-quality sound, but does sound ok and what do you expect for an inexpensive compact boombox? My daughter loves it, listning to it pretty much every morning while getting ready for school and every evening while getting ready for bed.Only downside is the same problem with most digital radios/stereos nowadays. You can't easily tune into your favorite station like your car radio-instead you have to sequence through all the stations you've programmmed into the unit."
1,Overpriced on Amazon,"I have just purchased this item and it does seem perfectly adequate for a secondary system (bought it to use on our enclosed patio.) I did not, however, purchase it through Amazon and my comment relates to why. Amazon lists the price at $199; however you can purchase this directly from the Sony website for $80 and I found mine at my local Sears for $79.95 (and saved on the shipping.) I have purchased many products from Amazon, over the years, and their prices have been consistently good, but from now on I will not assume that Amazon necessarly has the best prices. For Amazon (though in this case, this item is linked to an outside vendor) to sell stuff that is more than twice the price as available elsewhere, is very annoying. For $80, I love this boombox; for $199 I might not love it so much! I am extremely disappointed with my most recent (non-purchase) Amazon experience. Amazon - what gives???"
4,a nice buy,"It is an excellent buy.I have not tried any other boomboxes which were costing cheap.I just went for this, as this had am/fm/mp3 cd, and line in capability. Setting up is so easy and the remote functions are so cool exceeding my expectations. I never used its Atrac3 cd stuff, but the boombox is good at all it says to do.There is no doubt this is a good product, but I advise you to checkout the reviews of other products as well as they are relatively cheaper with almost the same features which we mostly use. However,if u want to go for a no risk deal, go for this."
1,Never worked,"This ""boombox"" never worked right out of the box. The cd player was unable to read any type of cd. I tried two brand new cds right out of their packaging. After contacting Sony they requested I ship the unit to Texas (they begrudgingly provided shipping costs) and offered me a refurbished unit to replace my brand new one. I rejected this ""generous offer"" and requested a new replacement unit. As it turns out this unit is no longer in stock so Sony offered me a refund minus my shipping and handling costs and sales tax paid. I would not reccomend this unit."
3,"Good sound, poor durability.","This boombox worked great for about 1.5 years. Great sound. I'd use it for a few hours twice a week at work. The CD drive mechanism died at that point, conveniently after the manufacturer's warranty. Sony quality has gone down over the years. I've got another Sony CD alarm clock that also has circuitry problems. My track forward button makes it stop. If you want to pay $77 for a year and a half worth of great sound, that's fine, but I'm not sure its worth it. Still searching..."
1,Warranty is a joke,I used it for about three months and it shows No Disc error message. Talking to their support and they want $29 for an exchange of a refurbished unit.
2,Disappointed,"The original I ordered arrived defective and I had to return it to Sony. However, I am not factoring this in my review since just about anything produced on an assembly line will have lemons. Sony replaced it but I am very disappointed in the sound quality. I generally expect Sony to be a cut above the rest and this one is two cuts below the rest. Digital recordings should sound sharp and crisp and on this loser they sound FLAT."
5,Sony Quality,"as with most Sony products, good quality unit with great sound I see why this product gets its good rating."
5,Great water bottle.,Good quality water bottle that allows me to carry enough water for the entire work day. I like the larger size that it is.
5,Awesome bottle!,"This is the second time buying this item. I would highly suggest it. Very durable, and very big! I am buying for my brother because he loves mine! Will buy again!"
5,love it,I bought this mostly to help keep track of how much water I drink daily. No more getting up and down to refill the small bottles many times during the day. Its great to have for my workouts. Usually drink the full bottle during a workout.
2,Useful... But disappointing,"Although the Silo is extremely practical for reducing trips to the local watering hole, it shattered on me resulting from a two foot drop onto concrete while it was full. Pretty disappointed with the craftsmanship, but I suspect it has something to do the being BPA free... Unless another monster low profile bottle is available I'll probably still buy again being more careful next time"
5,Great size!,This bottle is absolutely great! I was searching for a big enough bottle that holds 64 oz but this is great. I am able to finish the 48 oz in a matter of hours and usually refill again.
2,horrible,"It broke within 4 hours of having it...I was so mad that I did not want to send it back for a new one. There is no point of getting one from here. I was walking with the bottle and it dropped out of my hand, 3 feet down to the CARPET floor. The bottom exploded and shattered. I thought these bottles were supposed to last long...this has been the 2nd bottle I have had that has broken because of falling to the ground."
4,Just What I Expected,"I ordered this bottle after figuring out how many ounces of water I should be drinking per day (your weight x 0.32). It's the perfect size, made in the US, and very durable. The only thing I wish it had was the ""groove drink cap design: Flip & Sip,"" instead of the screw-off top with the wide mouth. Oh well... it's not any sort of an unbearable inconvenience =)"
2,doesn't cover the whole issue,"Booth makes a good case for infant baptism vis a vis dispensationalism, but infant baptism does not necessarily turn on this issue, as Paul Jewett demonstrates in Infant Baptism and the Covenant of Grace. I would recommend that Jewett's book be read along with this one to get a better sense of all the issues involved."
5,One of the Best Books on Infant Baptism,"I'm now reading/enjoying this book for the 3rd time. The first time around persuaded me of the biblical evidence for infant baptism. The second reading was with a close friend of mine (Baptist) and was helpful in persuading them towards infant baptism, although, rightly so, their greatest conviction was brought about by reading the bible. My third reading is with my roommate. They have grown up in the reformed faith, but, like many believers in infant baptism, they never heard or never were taught the bible based reasons for believing. Its amazing to me how much I continue to pick up on and learn form this book and the bible. I would recommend it to any wanting to be convinced of the subject.Additionally, this book also serves as a good introduction to covenant theology vs dispensationalism. The book argues that, only from a covenany view can you come to an agreement and find unity throughout the Old and New Testaments."
2,Misrepresentation of ........,"I am sad to say that I was not pleased with this book because of the authors misrepresentation of Dispensationalism. The author seems to be a speculator and is really trying to read things into the Bible to fit his view. I don't have a problem with Covenant of Grace, but by reading this book has really grounded me in the views of the dispensationalist. I do commend him on his effort and love for God and the family though so that I will give him the two stars for!!"
1,This is an OLD system - get the NEW one instead,"I actually bought a couple of these SILVER units and the reviews previously posted are right on. BUT Angeltrax came out with a newer model in BLACK (completely new design and remote), and it works great. My old model was swapped out because my previous transmitter couldn't even do what it was supposed to. Customer service DID help me through it and finally figured out that it was the hardware itself. So I didn't just get voice mail. Anyway, the new system allowed me to hook up an infared putput from the transmitter to the front of the cable box so now I can actually use the Cable remote in the other room, point it at the receiver and the channel will change the main cable box... so I can watch any channel I want (since the TV has to be on channel 3 to work with the COAX setting). The new one works great, but I agree - stay away from the Silver Model here. You will be sorely disappointed."
1,"This device does NOT work, at all!!","This device does not work as advertised, actually entirely. The first reviewer was correct -- it only has AV cables. Major problem -- so much interference -- very poor quality video and especially audio. When TV is connected to a normal cable, it works great, when to this device, it produces loud ""ssshhhh"" with horrid picture and sound.Don't buy it!It also says you can connect a USB cable to a computer -- that's an outright lie -- there is no USB outlet or cable. Oh, and by the way, it does not come with enough cables, so, if you buy it, you will also have to get a TV cable.The 1-800-673-1788 number that they give to call ""live technical support"" to help with interference simply goes to a voice mail box... there is NO technical support. Avoid this company and its products; I know I will!"
4,Anthology by Randy Van Warmer,"This album which has now been made into a CD is a master peice work of feelings by Randy Van Warmer. The letters on the first song, ""Just when I needed you most"" can be beyond the comparison to songs like ""I'm leaving on a jet plane"" or ""By the time I get to Phoenix"". It is one CD that you want in your collection."
4,"Hopeful, Beautiful Stories!","I found this compilation of stories of mothers connecting with their daughters very touching. After I lost my mother, I wanted to read hopeful stories of life after death, and the unbreakable bond between a mother and her child. Each story was unique as the woman who wrote it, and it gave me a peaceful feeling to know I was not alone in my longing to know that my mother is still with me."
4,Comforting Stories,"I received this book as a gift from my best friend right after my mother died. She passed six weeks after my father and it was totally unexpected. It was very healing to read the stories of those women who lost their mothers and recieved signs from them. I asked for, and also received, signs from both of my parents that were so unique and unlike any that I have ever read about, and only my parents would lknow what those signs meant to me & my family. This book is a good start in the healing process for anyone that is grieving the loss of a parent. Thank you Sinclair Browning, I can't wait to read the next Feather book."
4,Pleasant Book,"This is a very pleasant book to read especially when your Mother is dying. I will pass it along to any friends I have who may be going through what I am going through. It tries to reassure us that there is an afterlife and that people can communicate back to us from there. If I find out after I die that it can be done, I'll come back and write a better review! The most interesting part to me was reading how the author happened to put this book together."
4,A book to read if you are close to Mom.,"I am very close to my mother and as years pass I fear the inevitable. I think I purchased this book to convince myself that when my mom passes, she will not be far from me.This is a collaboration of short stories written by many different woman who have had many different realtionships with their mothers. Some of the stories seemed far fetched to me, or I had questions of ""what would give you even the slightest idea that that particular thing or occurance could have been a sign from your mother???"" but more often or not, it was touching to know these woman, what ever they may have expierenced, gave them comfort that their moms were letting them know they were still loved and not forgotten. And then they were some stories that sent me reeling with tears and chills up my spine. Either way, it is a good read."
4,Great Book,This book covers everything from meals to dessert. Low CARB solution meals without compromising the delicious taste.
3,Usability,"I just purchased the Atkins' New Diet Cookbook and have perused it briefly. However,without having started using the recipes, I have some suggestions to the author as to how to improve the usability.1. All recipes should be for the same number of servings. It is easy to double or triple for more servings.2. The page number should be included (rather than an asterisk indicating that the recipe is in the back of the book). I spent several hours locating the recipe and writing the page number by the meal plan. This before I even started considering cooking!3. Little effort was made to make the recipes cost effective. By that I mean, in the first two weeks, many ingredients are perishable but used only one time and small amounts required--such as 4 strawberries!5. Too much effort to make recipes exotic when more normal and available (also less expensive)ingredients would make the diet easier to manage and still maintain the low carbs."
1,Another Cheesy Photoshop Book,"This book contains little new knowledge or info on photoshop. Some of the techniques might give the reader a useful idea however the execution in general is more like the authors trying to show off instead of teach. After reading through the book there weren't many of lessons that I cared to duplicate or experiment with and certainly none that led to any advancement of my profession.I don't mean to be overly critical, but with so many PS books out there I am tired of mediocrity. There are other books available with much better and informative content."
3,Overdone,I teach both a begining and advanced Photoshop class for an Apple Specialist. I try to provide a book to go with the two day advanced class. Finding a book that is right for this class has always been a challange. I was sent this book to review and I have to say I was disappointed. It seems like they are wanting to impress and not use the route with the fewest steps. There are easier ways of doing most of these exercises. The effects themselves were also a little strange. The liquify filter is the old Kai's Power Goo and doesn't need a whole chapter on caricatures. I will say that there were a few (two) of the examples I was able to use in class.
4,A great intro to the power of Photoshop 6,"PhotoShop 6 Effects Magic is full of step by step walkthroughs on how to harness the new features in PhotoShop 6 to make graphic work easier and more effective. PhotoShop 6 has loads of new features and this book does a great job applying them to common PhotoShop tasks. From creative ways to create various traditional effects to getting the most out of the latest tools and features, this book chops the power of PhotoShop 6 into easily digestible bites. I highly recommend it."
3,product review,"The title of this CD is misleading this is not the original version of George Mccrae, ""Rock Your Baby"" this is either a re-recording or a new stereo sound CD. It only has 3 songs on it and all of them are ""Rock Your Baby"". One is accapella,the other is the song, and the other is an instramental."
4,Fantabulous,Great CD...only for lovers of classic Disco....Amazon got this CD for me...I had an LP...but that does not work anymore...But then this CD is a boon....They don't make artists like george MCCrae any more...only regret is that there are no lyrics on the sleeve of this CD...but a massive treat all the way...Enjoyyyyy!!!!
5,Girlfriend loves it!,I got this pendant for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it. It's the perfect size and it looks great. The chain is a box link and its really pretty. I'll definitely buy more jewelry from Sabrina Silver.
1,gotta have it,"personaly , i will buy this exspansion to get the ""AA"" abilitys,Yes i belong to an elete guild, yes there all over lvl 70 and over 800""aa's"",And i have absolutly no intrest in playing with newbies.and playing as a npc dosnt interest me, but,,,if your a low lvl. player , and you want to play with an experianced person , this will allow you too.So i guess you can say there is something for everybody in this exspansion.Best of luck to you ,,Babash of T-Marr"
5,Steam,"Steam! This beethoven 9th is steamy. Solti conducts with power and panache. I think the Soprano (Janowitz) is better in Karajan's 9th but the male soloists are better in Solti's. Talvela and Burrows will pin you back in your seat with their searing and intense voice. Also, Karajan's finale lacks power and exuberance - it is too controlled. Solti's on the other hand rings out with jubilation. Make no mistake. I think Karajan's 9th is outstanding - deserving a 5 star. But Solti's is more exciting and has more passion in it. Karajan is too controlled in his 1963 9th symphony.Steam! Steam! You must get this Solti."
4,good for tile,this works well when you have tile and tile borders instead of wood. I use double sided tape on latch and it works great. the plastic cap doesn't last and i have to replace every 2 years.
3,Not adjustable,"1) no choice of finish2) cheap looking brass coating, over metal3) bumper cap falls off easily4) doorstop holder is not made correctly... its not adjustable. If you try to adjust it, it will BREAK IN HALF!!Since you cant adjust it... you cant use this on doors that open at a perfect 90deg to the wall. The door would need to open a few extra degrees, so it can hit the holder at an angle. If your door can open more than 90deg, this is a good product. If not, keep looking. Just broke 5 of them trying to make it work on one of my doors!!"
2,Just average,"I bought this crust, along with the Sourdough flavor, and I was pretty disappointed with this one. The flavor was strange, and the smell was terrible. The sourdough was much better. Definitely will not order this product again."
3,Simple,"The French do have a knack for being able to make movies around seemingly trivial and day-to-day topics. This movie's storyline spins around a daughter (Sylvie Testud) and her mother's constant movement from one house to another. They are in a constant and unending cycle of selling their house & entertaining potential buyers. Their interaction with potential buyers is interesting (though not the highlight of the movie). The movie chugs along at its own pace letting the viewer soak in the slow story.At times, the movie gets boring and at other times it induces creative thoughts and at times reflection. I wonder how this movie might feel on a big screen. In my opinion, this movie is made for small screen viewing (lazy Saturday afternoon fare). You can excuse yourself numerous times for tea, coffee or beer and still catch the storyline as if it were a slowly moving train."
1,CAUTION: Mine Exploded,"I was recently using this product at a party. It exploded, emitting an 8 foot flame that burned for over 3 minutes. Two of us were pretty extensively burned and my counter was damaged. We were pretty lucky, not to imply that this should have happened.We were using it exactly according to directions. This product is an ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN."
2,Very Light Duty! For occsional use only,Very light duty unit with a flimsy case. 3 out of the 5 units that I ordered came with loose screws that impacted their performance. Great Price...Guess you still only get what you paid for. Spend a few more dollars and get a better stove
3,Bet your boots on Shinola!,"I hesitantly bought this because of the one track in the Acura commercial, but I have been playing it a lot lately (along with everyone else). Bossa Per Due is still the best song on the CD, but the remaining tracks are kitschy and fun and make you want to pull on your white boots and dance."
4,pour me another,"In the 90s, what was old was new again, and there was a big revival in cocktail/lounge music. Some of this was great--Stereolab mixed it with art rock and synthasized their work into all kinds of interesting directions. Some was not so good--a bunch of electronic stylings with no subtance whatsoever.Nocola Conte does not fall into either of these camps. His music does not really create new, but he sure is able to capture the essence of this 1960s, jazz lounge style. His music is not just an IDEA of what this music sounds like, washed out by a bunch of modern beats and eletronics. Arrangements here have real chord structures, interesting polyrythms, and even dissonences that remind me of Eric Dolphy's Out To Lunch.At times the modern production can be too light and airy, but others, the music is truely exciting."
1,Not a Nicola Conte recording,"I enjoy the work of Nicola Conte very much, and purchased this CD because Amazon listed it as being by Nicola Conte. However after listening to the disk, it does not sound like any of the other Nicola Conte recordings that I own, such as Jet Sounds, Bossa Per Due, or Other Directions. In fact Nicola Conte's name does not appear in the list of musicians, the composer, arranger, producer, or anywhere in the credits. So unless the name Marc Beacco is an alias for Nicola Conte, then it would seem to me that this is not a Nicola Conte recording, and that the listing in Amazon is incorrect. There is nothing on this recording that is in the cool, jazzy, lounge, bossa nova style that I associate with Nicola Conte. In summary, I am very disappointed with this purchase."
1,Poor Quality Material,I have used numerous slip on steering covers in the past. This was really one of the worst. The material was very poor and did not stretch very easily. Made slipping on a real challenge. A few weeks after I installed it the seems began to fray and I ended up throwing it out after a month of use.Save your money
3,expensive for what it has to offer,"This is an ok book but not one that I'd rush out to buy. My clients are more in the Government than in private sector and the info in here talks more to private sector issues but communicatoion is communication and I was hoping there would be new ideas/techniques, maybe some stattistics/research on how people best reveive/convey information. I didn't really get that from this book. There are better ones out there that are less expensive (check out Communicating Change)"
3,Average military murder mystery,"This is a fair story about a series of murders at a US army base. As in ""Courage Under Fire"", the main character is a female who is trying to deal with personal issues while trying to do her job. It is a fair, quick read but the plot is thin and the characters are not well developed. Wait for the movie."
4,A Feast for the Eyes,"Focusing on the art, music and architecture of Russia, this is a beautifully photographed documentary. Although Dr. Billington's commentary is eminently forgettable, that of the various Russians he interviews is excellent.With St. Petersburg being spruced up in anticipation of its 300th anniversary, this series is worth viewing prior to visiting the city."
4,Details not available elsewhere - see the heart of Russia.,This series of video tapes opens a window onto Russia not available from other sources. With the continued decline of the state of Russia as a country this series may be a passing glimpse of an empire about to disappear.
5,Great Resource,"I love the anthology structure of this work. A ton of solid arguments and golden short and well developed ""articles"" that hit different aspects of professional learning communities. As a principal I used many of the chapters with teachers because they are accessible and short."
1,Comatose,"Pete, Pete, Pete;I've been a fan of you an the guys for 32 years, an all I can say is WAKE UP!You were not only asleep when you wrote and recorded this mess, but you were comatose!I'm glad you got all these glowing reviews, it must help the ego, my only hope is that, on your next album you show that you have some life left in you...listening to this cd, actually made me depressed...not a good feeling.Anyway, for this fan of yours, this cd and your last one were REAL downers!Here's hope for the future that you get out of this deep blue-funk you've been in for the last decade...here's hoping buddy that you can turn it around and capture some of the old spark and excitement that made us ole Geils fans feel completely alive when we saw you in concert!"
4,A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,"Peter Wolf certainly isn't what one would think he is. His new CD ""Sleepless"" demonstrates that he has evolved from the one-time frontman for the J.Geils Band to be a musical chameleon. ""Sleepless"" is a genre-jumping album, familiar yet new at the same time. Wolf masters all the genres within, from Americana to Honkytonk to Blues to R&B (complete with a horn section) to classic 70s-type rock. Comparisons are everywhere on this album, which is perhaps why it is so pleasurable to hear. Mick and Keith guest, and so provide a Stones-y feel to some material, and one can hear some Van Morrison too. This CD is pure comfort food, not too challenging, but bliss-inducing. Buy it!"
5,brings you to your feet!,This album is like one long talented Jam session. tons of talent involved in this album. Jagger sounds great while keith really rocks. wish I could get a tape of them making this album! this is REAL music.
3,One song to tear your heart out...,"I bought this CD on the basis of hearing ""Nothing But The Wheel"" on the radio (yay, KPIG!) and expected, like a lot of music by artists I'm not very familiar with, to grow and love the rest of the songs.I was wrong. I've tried, but something about this CD doesn't do it. ""Nothing But The Wheel"" is a classic, but after the first run through, the rest of it irritates me to the point of having to put on something else. I'm still glad I bought it, but I can't recommend it if you want that one CD for your car, or are stuck on a desert island with limited choices."
2,Buy This ONLY for Mick & Keith,The only good songs on this are the ones with Mick (Nothing But the Wheel) and Keith (Too Close Together). The others contain 3rd grade rhymes and boring instrumentation.
5,7 Mondy Mantras for a Richer Life: How to Live Well with the Money You Have,"This book is what I wish I had read when I was in my 20's starting out in my career. It should be required reading for college freshmen who are being bombarded with credit card offers. I'm now 51, and as I read the book, I could hear all the things my parents tried to impress upon me when I was younger. Did I listen? Not enough. Would I have listened had I read this book? Maybe so, but I could kick myself for not listening back 30 years ago."
4,"Simple Advice, But A Good Place to Start.","This book is NOT a complicated or sophisticated guide to finance.I agree with some other reviews here that Singletary's advice is somewhat simplistic. Still, in my opinion, her easy, conversational writing style is what ""saves"" this book.Though the 7 Money Mantras are really nothing more than common sense, how many of us can say we actully use good common sense when dealing with our money? (Especially our use of credit.)It doesn't hurt to be reminded, every once in awhile, of plain and simple ways to save money, limit credit use, save for the future, and so on.The author gives us those reminders and the book is a good place to START learning about handling your personal finances.Reviewer: Linda Painchaud"
5,Financial Advice For The Masses,"Unlike the two listed reviews I feel this book is wonderful and has a unique voice. It's a fun read. It's funny. It's a book anybody can read. IT'S NOT AN INVESTMENT BOOK! So, if you're looking for a book on how to buy stocks or mutual funds or bonds with some stupid formula or system then you should look elsewhere. But if you're in debt, if can't manage to save any money, if you're wondering how to talk to your children about money then this is the book for you! Ms. Singletary continues in this book the great common sense advice she passes along in her syndicated column. In fact, Better Investing magazine gave it a great review in it's Jan. issue. The writer said this book was just what the everyday person could use right now!"
2,"Interesting...,but Naive","I expect better from a highly educated journalist or ""so-called journalist"" such as Michelle. She writes this book from a naive perspective.For example, her mantra regarding credit where she says that people should use cash to buy everything and not use credit. Many people are not in situations where they can pay cash for everything and I don't believe for one second that she has NEVER used credit.What about the family who works to support their family but does not have they available CASH to buy a computer for her children. Should she deny them the opportunity to improve and grow by not using credit? I think not. But Michelle does. And this type of immature thinking is seen throughout her entire book. As a 13 year veteran of the financial services industry, I would expect more from Michelle...such as reality."
1,Nothing But Media Hype,"There are many investment books out there that tell people how to invest, but this is not one of them. The entire time I was reading this book I was asking myself: Where's the Beef? Poorly done and poorly written!"
5,An excellent look at the world,"If you want to know what's really going on, then you have to pick up this book. While presented as cartoons, the underlying truths are insightful and compelling."
1,Mind Blowing,"Stephanie McMillan's ""Minimum Security"" online comic strip has finally been compiled into a book. Why, I don't know. Although the story lines are a little... insane, the artwork more tha... oh wait, the art looks worse than a kindergarten art class studying Pollock and the composition makes it almost unreadable. The ""socio-political commentary"" that so many readers ""enjoy"" is more of a commentary on the writers sanity and need for some serious treatment for paranoia. For the love of God stay away from this book."
4,Mythology Forr All,"Realizing I needed more information on mythology and after doing a thorough search on the subject,I found Bulfinch's Greek & Roman Mythology book just what I needed. I have found it to be very informative but not overwhelming on each subject. A wonderful addition to anyone's library."
1,Making Myths Tedious,"I bought this book based on the other reviews and its low price tag, but was very disappointed. Unless you are very into poetry, I do not believe you will enjoy this book. Somehow, it manages to make exciting myths boring. I would go with Hamilton's mythology book."
4,Still excellent,"This book provides a succinct introduction to many of the stories that underlie Western culture. The main part of the book presents a digest of Greek myths, arranged in a loosely along the ""genealogy"" of the Greek Pantheon. Included are brief synopses of the Odyssey, the Iliad, and the Aneid. These stories are no longer universally known as they were such a short time ago, and this book provides an easy introduction to them. At the end of the volume are included some stories of the Hindu and Nordic gods, but these, especially the Hindu stories, are not as satisfying as the Greek stories. [...] this book is a great buy!"
5,My son loves it!,"Bought this for my 12 yr old son, and he's so enthralled in it that he won't put it down. Great read!"
5,Dog hasn't destroyed it yet!,"We have a 100 lb German Shepherd who's mission is to destroy toys - and in the four days since she got it for Christmas, she has YET to destroy this one. That's a winner in our book!"
3,Compares withthose more expenisve Vitamims,Nature Made Essential Man Multivitamins compare with those expensive ones from Vitamins stores.Lower cost and wonderful wellness rewards from website.
2,Black History from Civil War through Today,This video series has a wealth of information. However the presentation of that information makes the videos not engaging.
1,Wrong Item Sent,"I ordered this phone case for someone in the office because it looked like a nice, black case. Protective, but with the swivel clip that was very convenient.What I received was a camoflaged print, fitted phone case for the Motorola V30.Not what I ordered at ALL. Doesn't even LOOK like the picture."
4,Well done Ms. Berry...,"You never know what to expect from writer Bertice Berry. Jim and Louella's Homeade Heart-Fix Remedy is evidence that Ms. Berry is not a ""cookie-cutter"" writer.This is a special book in which the characters come to life in their love and life situations. I enjoyed the connection between Louella and the spirit of her mother, aunt and grandmother! There is definitely a lesson in ""hearing"" the wisdom words of those before us. I would recommend this title to not only those readers over 50, but those under 50 as well. Jim and Louella know what to do and how to do what is needed! Well done, Ms. Berry! -LC"
3,Liked but not loved...,"Okay, the book starts off hilarious and an incredible page-turner. Then it gets a little slow and boring. Then it peps up again, but starts sounding like a lecturing grandmother. Then it dies towards the end because it just sounds like all-out nagging. It would definitely be the perfect book for someone with low self-esteem or someone who really needed to hear ""I love you""...but for me, it just went in one ear and out the other. But I still liked ""Haunting of Hip Hop"" and I loved the beginning of this book, so I know she's an amazing writer, just a little too teachy for my taste."
2,Fun read,"I don't normally read erotica, but this was the December 2010 book selection for the book club I'm in. This book was a little too graphic and the main characters were a little unbelievable. It lacked substance but it was overall an intriguing and humorous read, and I actually enjoyed the fantasy elements, since I normally only read scifi/fantasy.I joined a book club to broaden my horizons, and it has definitely done that. I am overall glad I took the time to read this book, despite it being erotica. I think the author attempted to do it tastefully, but it could've been toned down more, which would've made for a much better read."
4,The real brand is three 555 from Japan,"The real brand is three 555 from Japan, and I think is good, fix ok."
5,A lot of good and new material,Hearing of this new Horst book I wondered how much new material there could be above and beyond his previous books? The answer is: a lot! This big new volume has ten chapters of new or refined information that in many cases presented ideas I had not even thought of before with regards to climbing performance> One slight con to the book is the at times technical nature but overall the book is loaded with practical ideas I can begin using this winter to improve my training> There are also countless mental training< nutrition and recovery tips I look forward to trying out on the rocks In the end its a wonderful book that I could not put down!
2,pretty much the same dribble,"i've bought every book that this author wrote and it seems he just rehashes the same stuff he wrote from his previous books. there's nothing that's really new, except more up-to-date pics. not impressed at all."
2,Unnatural balance.,The uke sounds fine but the background instrumental is so overly bass exagerated that there is too much distortion...and I've got an audiophile set up. Completely unnatural.
3,Nice,"A nice novel with lost of historical information. Though, I have been to delhi quite a few times, never did I know the history and its existence about Delhi. Kushwant singh is know for spice & humour in his novels. This novel is no different. The novel starts with a good note, though in the middle, it becomes a bit monotonus. All in all, it is a good read.I recommend it!"
3,Easy-to-understand and informative,"I picked this one up on the strength of the previous ""Friendly Guide"" (The Friendly Guide to Shakespeare), and was not disappointed. While Hathaway's book is ostensibly about the universe, and does contain quite a bit of information about the subject, a better description might be ""Lives of the Astronomers."" From Copernicus to Hawking, Hathaway tours the universe by taking a time trip through the many advances of astronomy. Like the guide to Shakespeare, the chapters are short, and sidebars abound. I spent about three months working my way through the book, reading a section or two a night. While it isn't a substitute for Astronomy 301 (the math quotient was thankfully low), this is a nice book for those of us who like to know a little about a lot."
3,Good mix of traditional and more modern tunes,"Good mix of traditional and more modern music. I would have liked to hear more than the single instrumental tune. The boys have good voices and sound somewhat like the old Kingston Trio with Scotish accents. Biggest fault is a total lack of jacket notes. The lyrics to the songs would have been very helpful, especially the first 3 or 4 which are in heavy brogue."
3,.,"The Hafler Trio are just enigmatically pseudo-scientific enough, and aesthetically concise, to make even a release like Seven Hours Sleep somehow worthwhile. But it is not some of the more interesting work the group has released. The endless and unbroken sea of lo-fi samples and tinny effects gets downright dreary after a little while, and it's just a bit too random feeling. Not terribly engaging. There's a part of me that still likes it anyhow, though I'm not sure I could explain why -- but unless you are a H30 fan already and need this as a part of your collection, I'd advise you to check out some other H30 releases first."
5,Another key piece of 80s experimental music,"Allegedly based on dream research, this is non-academic electroacoustic/musique concrete at it's finest. If you enjoyed the ""orphee"" period collaborations between Pierre's Henry and Schaeffer you will love this, it's really that good. And for the rest of you who have no idea what I am talking about, get out and discover experimental music already! There is this vast wealth of music beyond Radiohead, Sigur Ros and whatever other pop bands try to pass themselves off as avant garde. Seriously, it's time to challenge your mind and let your sense of hearing grow beyond ""DO RE ME"". And this is a great place to start."
1,The worst disc I own,I was foolish enough to buy this after reading some interesting sounding reviews of it but was deeply disapointed.This is poor in conception and in delivery. If I could I would give it no stars.BLAH!!!
3,The Way You Moves,"This books you can buy it if you don't know how to make up maybe its for the first time you playing with the color of make up. Maybe this book is to amature for someone know how using make up and what kind of color match the situation and basic color of their faces. Although, this books good for easy learning how to make a moves and feel confidence."
4,Interesting Simple Intro,"As a beginner, the book presents Foucault as a documenter - discussing and disecting the history of power and professional relations. He covers knowledge and power, sexuality, prisons, mental health.... The span is enormous, highlighting Foucault's multidisciplinary reputation.The downside of the book (indeed a limit of the Manga-like series) is it spends too much time on Foucault's role as as a chronicler of data, and leaves the reader on their own for much of his conclusions. An example: the book talks of Foucault's description of the medical clinic and doctor's ""Gaze"" but the book doesn't share if Foucault thought this was good or bad. Given Foucault's well deserved reputation as a complicated writer, this beginner could use the help."
4,A Nice Introduction to the History of Power,"Beginners books sets out to simplify Foucaults work and essentially does so. Sometimes almost too simple. I enjoyed the material, as I had no clue what Foucault was about previous to reading, however, I also felt the writing was a little too sparse. The pictures are nice, which makes this series attractive, yet, they filled the page often with splash words and large fonts which sometimes seemed unnecessary or only to fill a page. Regardless, the text is good and informative and reccomended for anyone who is interested in reading Foucault for the first time but does not know where to begin."
3,Hard to follow,"Bought this book a few weeks back and i must say it seems very informative of the Hebrew customs of western Africa..Ive only read 2 chapters so far.. Book gives a very interesting look into the ways of the Ashanti of western Africa and their ways in Jamaica during slavery and afterward.. Only problem Im having is that the book is a little hard to read.. Not hard meaning that it uses difficult words; but hard meaning, hard to follow.. Perhaps there could have been a better, or more reader friendly way to inform... I have other books to read that deal closely with the subject of the Hebrews.. I plan on sitting this book down and coming back to it later.."
2,Mostly fluff,"I've been reading a lot of business books to get information on how to grow my business. Of all those books, this one is mostly fluff. Many of the statements are vague and ambigious. There isn't much for solid advice. Buzzwords are used everywhere (Do you want a ""value-added investor"" funding your business?) Numbers and statistics are nonexistant other than a few graphs that look like they were sketched by hand. The author tends to throw lots of questions at you to think about, but doesn't give any advice on the topics.There were a few bits of useful information on how other people will look at your business and value it, but it's not worth reading through the whole book for them.

3,like the camo,"the towel size was ok, & the camo print is nice.The towel is very thin. I am disappointed in the quality"
2,Let it die.,"This is not a good Beach Boys album. Most of the songs here sound like poor copies of songs they did before. They even tried to duplicate their success with ""Rock and Roll Music"" by recording another Chuck Berry song, but ""School Day"" doesn't work well for them at all. The other songs are all ""originals"", but they sound pretty derivative of previous Beach Boys songs. The best song here is probably ""Goin' On"", and even that one isn't all that great. It's really a shame how far the Beach Boys had fallen by this point. Don't get this CD."
4,"High quality finish, Easy installation and Solid Feel","As usual with Amazon, the product showed up very quickly. Installation took all of 10 minutes and was simple and straightforward. The faucet is made of heavy brass and has a rich chrome finish that matches my Hansgrohe shower trim perfectly. The included hardware and fittings are high quality and the valve levers are smooth and very solid feeling... no play in the handles like you get with lower quality faucets. Very happy with the purchase."
2,Not in New Condition as Advertised,"Amazon lists this faucet as ""new"". When I received the faucet I noticed that the Kohler quality seal was broken on the box. Obviously, someone had previously opened the box. When I opened the box, each handle and the faucet were nicely wrapped in cushioned, protective bags but all three pieces had significant nicks on them down to bare metal. Since they were in these protective bags, I was sure that it was not damaged in shipment. This particular faucet that Amazon shipped me was either used or a factory reject. Either way Amazon should not be advertising them as new. I did not have any problems with returning it to Amazon for a full refund."
1,Kohler K-394-4-CP Devonshire Widespread Lavatory Faucet,"I ordered 3 sets of this faucet. All delivered in one package on time.Upon delivery, the conditions of all boxes were in good shape indicating that there has been no damages during the transportation. The seals on the Kohler boxes were all broken although the boxes looked new.BUT, 2 out of the 3 sets (supposedly sold as new items by Amazon) have minor but noticeable scratches, and the 3rd set has a hair-line crack on the main body of the faucet, which resulted in water gushing out from the side of the faucet right after installation.End result: paid the plumber for installation but the faucet had to be uninstalled immediatelty after because of the defect.Someone, Amazon and/or Kohler needs to get their act together since this is not just happening to my order, other reviewers had reported the similar problem."
5,"Great, high quality faucet","We recently remodeled our master bathroom and have been extremely pleased with the look of the Kohler Devonshire line. The faucets are very high quality and are a good height so you don't have to bend over very far when doing things like brushing your teeth, etc. The drain is a little loud but besides that the water flow is great and the handles make it easy to control the water temperature. Couldn't be happier!"
2,ANOTHER RECIPIENT OF DAMAGED FAUCETS,"We ordered FIVE brushed nickel Kohler faucets (K3944BN) from Amazon. They were packaged well, and (importantly, for the bathroom refurbishing job we were doing) they arrived THREE DAYS BEFORE THE EARLIEST ARRIVAL DATE predicted by Amazon...... Unfortunately, FORTY PERCENT (2/5) of the order suffered from damage -- either stains of the visible brushed nickel parts, or tool marks on one of the faucet handles, or both. This experience mirrors that of many other customers who have reported here...... Amazon is doing its best to recover, however. They are going to ship out the necessary two replacements, which they predict will arrive WITHIN THE ORIGINAL DELIVERY WINDOW. If the new items arrive in good condition on time, we'll let you viewers know !"
3,Unmatching faucets,"I placed an order for two Kohler faucets for my master bath. They arrived on the same date, in two different sized, and different looking boxes. My plumber connected them while I was out, and when I returned, he had completed his work and was about to leave. He showed me that one faucet set was light and the other was dark. One had a high shine, while the other had a dull finish. The faucet sets share the same double sink, and frankly, the difference in them causes them to look cheap. They were quite expensive and it's a terrible shame that this happened. I am quite disappointed."
1,Made in China!,To think this old Wisconsin company imports their faucets from China. Shame. Apparently Kohler can't stay in business if they make their faucets domestically. Also note that the Devonshire accessories are made in Taiwan.
1,Not a favorite,"This product did not get approval by anyone in my family...celiac or not. Although easy to prepare, we strongly disliked the chocolate flavor. We have tried a lot of great gluten free products, but this one I don't recommend."
5,the one to start with Screamin' Jay Hawkins,"First of all, I would like to notice that it's the reissue of his first album ""at home with S.J.H."" (originally issued on Epic in 1958) with a different order in the titles and a different cover. Secondly, I think it's the album of reference of his long and heratic carreer. Personally, I was so blowed when I first heard his powerful voice able to sing blues, easy listening or rock. A true artist of music hall in a sense that he is a true character."
2,Mostly rubbish,I bought this because I heard the title track on radio and was astounded by it. I still am. I love it. The rest of the album is hideous. but I got what I bought it for. No complaints
3,Wasn't sold on this one.,"Tony Hoagland, Donkey Gospel (Graywolf, 1998)While I was reading Donkey Gospel, I was never quite sure whether I liked it or not. One minute I'd find myself enchanted by the homey quality of poem A, the next minute the ham-handedness of poem B would put me off. It took me about three-quarters of the book to realize that these qualities were one and the same. This, of course, confused me even more, to the point where I'm simply giving it the gentleman's C and saying ""hey, reader, you decide on this one."" Which, yes, does imply I think you should pick it up and give it a shot. After all, the ""homey"" side may be right. I've got myself so confused at this point I don't know.""Daydreaming comes easy to the ill:slowed down to the speed of waiting rooms,you learn to hang suspended in the wallpaper,to drift among the magazines and plants,feeling a strange lovefor the time that might be killing you.""(""Medicine"")You be the judge. **"
4,Fast Ship,"needed the book for a pop culture class, didn't want to pay full price, found it on amazon and had it within 2 days of ordering."
1,ugh,"The banality, tunelessness, and all-around god-awfulness of Tony Hoagland's poetry is almost heart-breaking, but the high self-regard with which they are written relieves the reader of any compassion for the writer. I heard him read in Pittsburgh, and he was little more than a bundle of affectations. The poems themselves are merely strings of quips and pedestrian observations and sophomoric editorializings. He has no eye and no ear. Any discerning reader will feel cheapened after spending time with these poems."
3,Nothing terribly skin deep bout this memoir,"My reaction to this book is rather mixed.I adore the temptations, especially David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks. Now, I do appreciate a good groupie memoir, so it met my satisfaction in that area, but on the standpoint of taste and quality, I was very disappointed. I am rather bothered that Ms. Sapia insinuates that this book, in some shape, form, or faishion, was supposed to paint Ruffin in a more positive light, in contrast to the Otis Williams memoir. It most certainly did not!...If this book was written with the defining purpose of exploiting her relationship with the great, late Temp, I would have given it five stars, but as there is a deal of deception to the reading public, It only merits three from me. However, it is an interesting read."
3,a fool in love with a fool,"Some portions of this book were somewhat interesting; however there were too many ""grapevine"" stories, particulary the ones about Tammi Terrell. Geena shouldn't have printed such lies. She resented Tammi because David left her while purposely pregnant. Geena was also in denial about his marriage to Sandra. I believed she lied about David only being with Tammi for money - as if she was the love of his life. It is obvious she resented just about everyone at Motown. Geena wants the world to think she was the love of his life - especially after the book and movie by Otis Williams. The sole purpose of the book is to exploit her relationship with David. Even though it gave more insight to David Ruffin fans, she could have kept this memoir to herself. She is still unknown to many and aways will be. Why is your last name Ruffin? Why are you planning an AfterLife with him. I hope she is still in therapy."
1,"Terrible content, terrible writing","The book title was so misleading. This woman (bless her heart) really believes that she was David Ruffin's common law wife when indeed she wasn't. From what she wrote, she was the woman that he ""kept on the side"" as he remained married and dated other women. The author wanted the reader to feel sorry for her because he continued to cheat on her although he was NEVER truly committed to her by my definition. She also talked about how he beat her over and over again, yet she continued to let him crawl back into her bed. She even changed her last name to Ruffin after his death. The book was loaded with grammatical errors and it appeared that it had not been edited because like a high schooler, she underlined words for emphasis (which was very distracting)."
3,service good... book not so good,"see its like this... i COULDVE wrote this book... it was all over the place, plus it costs way too much for it to be written as it was. as for the delivery, condition, and service that was GREAT! im just mad at myself for paying almost $30 for this book"
5,A Memoir: David Ruff - My Temptation,"Since I am a big fan of The Temptations and especially David Ruffin....I was anxious to read the story of a woman who spent her life loving him.As I read the book, I came to know David and felt the pain and love Genna shared with him. For anyone who has loved and lost....this is a wonderful book. I truly enjoyed it."
2,A Memoir: David Ruffin-My Temptation,"David Ruffin arguably one of the greatest R & B singers who ever held a microphone. Naturally talented, a showman unfortunately extremely flawed and self destructive. The book was poorly written as least the copy I ordered. However, it did provide one side of the story which is just that, one side of the story."
2,Don't Be Tempted,"The idea of this book being a love story is interesting, you want to read about David Ruffin outside the spotlight from the mother of his son. However, the entire book was like the writer sat down and started typing, turned in the book and it went to print. Events flash back and forth, words are underlined, and one never quite understands what about the relationship that made her put up with abuse and other women. Supposedly, the lies began from day one so what was the glue again? I love Motown and the idea of reading about the real deal of any of the many stars is appealing, but I found no real deal here. Also, to the author, with regards to the ""letter to Otis,"" where exactly would you have fit in the movie about the Temptations?"
5,Amazing,"I LOVE this book! It was amazing I love the Temptations & David Ruffin was my FAVORITE I love his voice. Anyway I must say that I wasn't really shocked with his behavior towards Genna or any of others he abused. The part that shocked me was that in the book Genna mentions he beat her with closed fists. I can't imagine how horrifed she must have been. You can't do anything but admire her & her courage to come out & tell the truth about their relationship. Anyway, reading this book was a great experiance for me I didn't get bored once."
5,Enigma Variations: A Must Have for Your Library,"Elgar's Enigma Variations is a classic, especially the 9th variation, the ""Nimrod (Adagio)."" Performed by the Philharmonia Orchestra, they bring a warm and passionate sound to this fantastic piece of musical literature."
4,The Magician's Nephew,It was a very groovy book. I recommend it to anyone who likes to read books about magic.
3,A good introduction for Narnia,"Well, it is a good start for Narnia but the story is a bit too boring. The improvement can be made by: 1.) More interesting story 2.) More details 3.) More adventures"
3,An Awesome Review by an Awesome Person!!!!!!!!!!,"I really didnt enjoy this book that much. Sometimes I had to force myself to read it, just so i could get my book report done.Now if you were younger than me i'm sure you would like this book. I thought it was boring but it has great description in it and had a creative plot. The book's climax wasn't very exciting to me. I beleive that this book is meant for people that like magical and action type books. I guess thats not me. Its more of those kind of books that has made up creatures and animals that talk in them. Personally I think that can be stupid at some points in time. The author C.S. Lewis did a very good job on coming up with his characters names and personalities. Go him (or her) yaaa! Finally I would like to say that this book is ok but not one of my fav books! (no effince to the author)''An Awesome person ''"
5,Lovely! Wonderful! Superb!,"C. S. Lewis' books about Narnia are some of the best books ever written!""The Magician's Nephew"" tells about the creation of Narnia, so I recommend that you start from here and read all of the books in the series. You won't regret it!"
3,Ring the bell and set the witch free,"This book seems to have been written to give the classic "" The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" from the '40's a history, but later? C.S. Lewis continued to write about this alternate fantasy reality with the Christian overtones for seven books. I don't rate this as one of the better ones,but they are all interesting mixes of magic, alternate worlds andChristian divine right of kings mythology. We have ordinary boys and girls on their summer/ vacation ""adventures"" become princesand princesses in Narnia where the horse and other animals talk.This story starts the sequence as the boy and the Lion Aslan create a new young world where Narnia is a kingdom. Time and space and laws on nature are different in these parallel worlds: Charn from where the witch comes is very old, Earth is between in age and Narnia's world is new.I have to say that even the worst of these books is very well written and thought out by a master story teller."
4,The Magician's Nephew,"The Magician's NephewDigory and Polly, with the ""help"" of Digory's uncle, get themselves into... well, into another world. Who knows if they'll ever get home!"
4,Good read,This was a good book. I liked getting lost in the magic. I will read the other books in the series.
5,Fantastic,"Wow, what a great book. I WOULD RECOMEND IT TO ANYONE. It was a fantastic plot setter, and made the whole series make way more sense"
4,The Magician's Nephew,"""Don't I just wish I was taller, I'd punch you in the head!'Two friends, Polly and Digory, that just met are off on a mission to get rid of and evil magical queen from a different world, find a magic apple for a talking lion. They had to do all this, just with a few rings, and a fling horse named Strawberry. He is tempted to keep the apple and give it to his dieing mother. But in the end, he gives the lion the apple, and if you want to find out what happens to his mom!This is the best book of the series, and most likely my favorite book. I would rate it a 9 out of 10, and highly recommend it to all readers, seven and older"
5,Read this book!,"The book ""The Magician's Nephew"" is a fantastic book. Digory and Polly go through the different worlds and wake up the Witch accidently. And Narnia starts all because of the lion, Aslan. But disasters are coming to them. Read this book and the series to find out what happens. If you want a book full of adventure and fantasy this book (and series) is great to read! Hope you enjoy."
4,As I remembered it,"The story is just as I remembered it from childhood. The fantastic pre-curser to the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. It rightfully is not as famous as the second book, but in terms of the kindle edition, great maps and illustrations included. Loses nothing from the original."
5,Hard To Put Down!,"This is truly a magical, and wonderful book! I have seen the movies, but decided to read them in the order where this is the first book, it is an amazing one too. It answers the questions you might ask, it tells you how Narnia came to be. I would recommend this to all ages, it's a very great story, I couldn't stop reading! I just love this! And I hope everyone else will too!(:"
3,The Magian Nephew,"The book I read was the first book in the Chronicles of Narnia series The Magicaian's Nephew. The Magician's Nephew was written by C.S. Lewis.The type of book this is is a fantasy. That means it didn't really happen.This boook is about two kids named Digory and Polly. THe way they meet is they both go and spend the summer in London. Digory's uncle is a magician, and he uses them them in a trick and sends them flying into a magical adventure.My impression of The Magician's Nephew was a good book but I think it would be good for 7th graders"
4,"Fast & quick read, GREAT story so far!","I bought this series in anticipation of the movie coming out in December. As a child, I remember reading the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe but none of the others. I just started and finished the first in the series, The Magician's Nephew and was sucked in at the very beginning and I'm excited to get on with the next books but I have a feeling the series is going to want me to wish the story never ended.This book, about magical rings transporting people to other worlds, is a fast and easy read but I highly recommend it for ALL ages. And if you've read it when you were younger, I suggest reading it again. I fell asleep last night thinking of the far away place that these children went to. Not many books are able to do that!!"
4,"Good book, too short","I wanted to read this book in preperation for the movie coming out this December and for school. It was very good, but i must warn those who aren't big fantasy lovers. This book is 110% fantasy, some ""cutesey"" fantasy. Over all though its very good, it kept my interest, although compared t be just finished Eragon, it seemed rather short. Good for a quick reading book, and if you love fantasy, or just want to read the books before seeing the movie"
2,THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW REVIEW,"I liked C.S. Lewis's The Magician's Nephew because of how he explained the characters and made the places they go to come alive. The way C.S. Lewis used magic in this book was amazing. I enjoyed how he made the animals magically talk in the story. I think what they had to say was interesting. The two main characters, Digory and his neighbor Polly, go on an amazing adventure from Earth to Charn to Narnia and back to Earth again. Charn is a sick and dying world. Narnia is a beautiful grassy country. Digory's Uncle Andrew is a crazy old guy who `thinks' he is a magician and sends Polly vanishing into to a different world. Then Digory, fuming with anger, goes after her and this is where the adventure begins. I would recommend this book to my mom because it's a great adventure book and I think she would enjoy it."
5,Narnia is Great,"I read this when I was about 7. It was excellent. Now I plan to read book two sometime this year. Though, I don't rememeber much of this book. I tried finishing book two but I couldn't and now I will to finish reading Narnia. This book was excellent."
4,A Great Book!!,"I really liked this book, but it a lot of confusing words which made me rate it 4 stars,but I would read it anyway! Pauline Baynes did an exquisite job on the illistrations, but if they were in color they would be prettier. Go to your local bookstore and pick this book up!Enjoy!"
5,Deep and delightful. But not difficult.,"It may have been CS Lewis who said that if you can't explain a concept to your grandma, you haven't mastered it yet. In this book, CS Lewis masterfully expresses his vision of our origins and the happy Creator. This book pulls you into that happiness. :-) Yet it isn't a naive fairy tale, lingering about is a familiar, relatable evil. An excellent beginning to the Chronicles of Narnia. I suggest starting here, then working your way chronologically through the books."
4,The Magican's Nephew,"Hey, did you see the Narnia movie ? I bet you will be intrested in this book. This book is about a boy and a girl go into this mystical land . I'm not telling you how they got in, But I'll tell you this . This is on my to 5 list of favorite books because the author gives you so much detail . So if you like the Fantasy genre or the Lord of the Rings then you have to pick this book up!"
5,The Magicians Nephew by: C.S. Lewis,"The Magicians Nephew was an amazing book and tons on adventure and after seeing the movie The Lion, The Witch, And the Wardrobe is answered a lot of questions i had. I definitly recomend this book for anyone. HAVE A GREAT TIME READINGThis rewiew was written by: Kris JainP.S. If you read the whole book you will want to read the others so buy them all!"
4,A Wonderful Story for Children and Adults,"C.S. Lewis's ""The Magician's Nephew"" is the first in a exciting and original series that can be enjoyed by children and adults. The story involves a boy and a girl, Digory and Polly, whose Uncle dabbles in magic. When he offers them rings, both Digory and Polly find these rings have greater powers than even their Uncle expected.Lewis was a devoted Christian who wrote the series to reflect his religious beliefs. My only complaint is that at times, Lewis makes little effort to hide the fact that certain elements from ""The Magician's Nephew"" are directly from the Book of Genesis. Despite this ""flaw,"" this is a wonderfully imagined book and very original. Recommended."
5,The Beginning of it All!,"This is one of the most absorbing and beautiful book I have ever read in my entire life. C.S. Lewis is an amazing children's book writer. I wish he had written many more books, but I love them all. This particular book is the beginning of the comings and goings between Narnia. During a yucky and cold summer, two children named Digory and Polly become good friends. They are exploring a secret passage when Digory's mad uncle gives them a horrible yet amazing gift. They are crystaline rings which will transport you into a different world. They go on many incredible adventures and return to London with a horrible queen. In attemps to make her leave, they take her to a new land being born where they meet all kinds of extraordinary creatures."
4,Wonderful!!,"I wanted to read this series, and it was recommended to me to read this one first, even though it's the sixth book in the series. What a wonderful book and now that I am on the actual first one, it's making so much sense. I love this story and C.S. Lewis has a beautiful way of telling the story and painting the scene!! Wonderful!"
4,Well done story,"It was fun to read, was entertaining, captivated my attention so that I nearly read it at one sitting, so I will probably continue with the series."
5,Simple but Good,"I've been wanting to read C.S. Lewis' series for a while now and I'm happy I've started. I had herd from a lot of people that it is a great series, I have to agree with them. I didn't so much expect it to be on a 3rd grader reading level, so it's not so mentally demanding and I got frustrated every now and again because my recent reading has had much more detail and character development. But I can't be upset at the book because I wasn't its intended audience.There is - however - one MAJOR flaw with this series. You can buy them all compiled into one big book, but you can't buy them in one big heap on a kindle!!! I finished this book in less than a day, and if they all came in one big collection, I could have just kept reading into the next book."
3,Please do not read this book first in the series,"Will someone please print the books in their original, correct order? I loved this book when I first read it, but only because of the ones that came before it. (I was seven at the time.) When I gave this to my niece, she almost didn't read the rest of the series. (I re-ordered her set, and she enjoyed it much more). C.S. Lewis created a beautiful, magical world--why do publishers feel they need to ""correct"" his work?"
5,5 star book! by 11 year old mohmad sabha.,The magician's nephew is a creative yet odd book. Im am not limited to the creativity and the wonders of immagintion. Suprisingly it is fulfilingMe even though i have never liked narnia fantasy pish posh but it is way more than that it is a adventure in your own world as if you are the charecters. So let me tell you about what i have read from this book. It is about a boy named digory and a girl named Polly. They had just met each other while walking around and agreed to explore a abonded house. Hoping to find something they run it digorys uncle who tranfers them to a diffrent world where there adventures begin like a evil queen and witchesAnd i wont ruin the story any more i hope you enjoyed it by!
5,Amazing!,I have not read these books in many years. It is great to read something from my days in grade school!
4,the beginning,narnia has always been one of my favorite series and this book lived up to my expectations. i'll admit this wasn't the best book of the series but it wasn't worst either. overall it was a great story. it has all all the things that make narnia one of the best series of all time.
2,Not one of C.S. Lewis's Best Works,"Even though C.S. Lewis has written numerous fantastic novels for all ages, the one titled ""The Magicians Nephew"" was not his best. He included great description, which helped the reader to create a clear, detailed picture of the scene that was trying to be described. However, C.S. Lewis made the story drag on and on so that it seemed to take forever to get a picture full of description of what he was trying to say. I also do not think that this book had the best plot. I would recommend ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,"" C.S. Lewis's most famous and best (in my opinion) books written, for children, teenagers, and adults to read. This is because it is not only a Newberry Award winning book, but includes phenominal descriptive phrases and easy vocabulary for people of all ages to understand. He also makes this book seem like you are one of the characters actually in the land of Narnia, interacting with all of the other characters."
2,"liked the movie better,","i love the Narnia movies!!! but the books are so much worse. they r way more stupid, boring, and confusing, i would recommend the movies but not the books."
2,Boring!,"I read the Mgicians Nephew for a school report. I love the chronicles of narnia books however, i was deeply appauled by the lack of excitment of this book. It was boring and there was onyl one good part. I did enjoy how it connected to the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe however. I guess i shouldn't have expected much form the first book that began it all though. But i would highly advise you to not read this book but instead just read a summary because its not worth your time."
2,Natalia,"Honestly this is not a book that I would recomend to anybody beyond the age of 11.This book was too fake.A girl named Polly who met a boy named Digory became friends.One day Digory's uncle who thinks he is a magician gave Polly and Digory a green ring.They magicly go into a ""new world"".They meet new people and animals!I guess if you want to figure out what the rest of the book is about you should read it.Like I said I wouldnt recomend it,but it WAS intresting."
2,O.k at times but goes noware,This book goes noware but down.The begging is good and then in the middle goes down ward.It's o.k. at times but fore die hard fantasy fans like Harry Potter stay away.
2,Natalia,This is not a book that I would recomend for anybody.This book was too fake.A girl named Polly who met a boy named Digory.One day Digory's uncle thinks he is a magician so one day Digory's uncle gave Polly and Digory a green ring.they magicly go into a new world.They meet new people and animals!I guess if you want to figure out what the rest of the book is about you should read it.Like I said I wouldnt recomend it.
5,A beautiful allegory about creation,This is one of the books that I read to my first grade class every year. The symbolism is amazing and the word pictures are unique to the mind of C.S. Lewis. Please don't deprive yourself of this unforgettable experience. Read this book
5,The Magician's Nephew Answered My Questions,"C.S. Lewis, in my opinion, is an excellent story writer. This story is wonderfully written and full of captivating ideas. I liked the fact that the story takes its time, taking perfect moments to explain the characters and events.Some of the things I was glad to find out is where the Wardrobe came from, where the Queen came from. I even laughed at the Queen during some of her charades and understood immediately who she was. I was also glad to find out who the Professor was in the house of the 2nd book. Even the lamp post was explained.Even though, this book is geared towards young readers, I believe adults will find enjoyment in it, as well. It is a great book.Thanks."
5,Amazing!,I just loved this book so much. It describes how everything had happened.Trust me you'll like this tale.
5,My favorite Narnia Book,"This is my favorite book in the Narnia series. As a child, I was delighted that this book gave the origins of the wardrobe and the lamp-post that were so important in ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe."" I love the character of Uncle Andrew, and the scene when he refuses to believe in the magic of Narnia is absolutely hilarious. This marvelous episode also features one of my all-time favorite quotes from literature: ""The trouble about trying to make yourself stupider than you really are is that you very often succeed."""
4,Pretty good.,Pretty good book. I enjoyed it very much.. It talks about the forming of a place called Narnia (The Land of Youth) and how it formed.. I especially loved the charecter of Aslan and the understanding he had and his personality. I REALLY disliked Jade.. The EVIL Queen. She really kind of ticked me off by her evil and her cruelness.
2,"Not bad, but not great either","While some of the information is unique to this book (like the part about ferret sounds and body language) there are some alarming errors (a ferret should NEVER be housed in an aquarium!). Use it as an additional reference, but not your primary one. You should have several different sources to refer to anyway."
1,10 Years Hardly Made Any Difference,There are many more up-to-date reference books on the Domestic Pet Ferret. It's an add to my Ferret book collection only. I recommend researching all books available before deciding to be owned by Ferrets.
4,Really good watch!,"Keeps perfect time. Only problem I have is putting it on, extension sometimes pinches arm a little bit. But an extension watch dies this. Wish I'd bought a clasp watch by Timex."
4,eebridgett,"Very nice, just have to get used to stretch band again, little snug until I wear it a little longer. Have only had it a week."
5,DVD: Special Planes: Tools and Techniques from a Master Woodworker,"Excellent DVD, I highly recommend it is very didactic, not only for beginners but for professionalsI really like it, Thank you very much"
1,This is not an exercise workout.....,"As stated already the amount of dialog ""inofmercial"" vs. actual workout leaves much to be desired. Now let's talk about the workout - the routine is cheap and hard to follow. Don't get confused it's not a hard workout - just choreographed very badly. The instructor is a novice to put it mildly. Save your money on this one."
4,Bad Taste Is In?,"The Killer Barbies 2 IN 1 is a set of CDs I picked up after hearing Have Some Fun on a PS2 game. Normal for me - I sometimes hear a song from a TV show or an anime and I go hunt for the band. I have to say I was happy with the end result - most of the music was good, the songs were funny, and the band has energy."
4,General Sequel,"For the most part, this game is DCHeroes. In some cases the game is a word for word copy of the 3rd edition softcover from Mayfair. That said, the additions to powers and skills are mostly valuable to game play. Some specifics are actually fleshed out a bit more and the examples are -very- useful in explaining power details.The BoH universe detail are less than spectacular. Many pregen NPCs are odd, bizzare, or downright goofy. Since I never planned on using their universe, I find this a minor issue.The main problem I have is the artwork. A great deal of artwork seems as though it was drawn by a three year old, or worse.Again, since this doesn't impact the game play, it's not a horrible problem. It's just annoying to look at while searching for a rule."
4,Trapping Coons,"This book is a great read. It is made for new trappers and helps them learn what they need to do to trap coons. Raccoons are one of the easiest to trap and so this book is not intended for experienced trappers. However even experienced trappers will enjoy reading this book, they just might not learn anything new. Buy this book, read it, write down notes and then sell it or give it to a young trapper apprentice."
4,fancy,"It's a fancy mask and I like it. The only thing is those feathers next to mouth will always cause problem when I tried to eat with the mask on. anyway, I still like it."
4,Mardi Gras Feather Couples Mask,We purchased this mask for a masquerade party last summer. It arrived very fast and in good shape. My girlfriend said it was comfortable and she was able to see clearly with no blind spots. It looked great on her and we won first prize!
5,Mask of Beauty,"I loved the mask when I saw it. I received it on time. It is as beautiful as it was online. My daughter then bought another one from the same company just as beautiful. I am very happy with what I bought, would and have bought from them again."
5,Mask,"This was for my Christmas Themed Party. I really like the mask, good quality and will be able to use it for other occasions as well."
1,im not sure if mine is a mini or not since it was a gift,"my izone camera isnt what i thought it would be, the pictures just havent come out good at all. the slightest move will ruin the picture. its ok for kids to play with but for a 20 year olds point of veiw they stink."
1,U GET WHAT U PAY FOR,CHEAPLY MADE. PICTURES WERE HORRIBLE..BARELY VISIBLE ONCE DEVELOPED. FILM IS A STICKY MESS TO DEAL WITH..& TO TOP IT ALL OFF ...DIFFICULT INSTRUCTIONS.! DO URSELF A FAVOR & DO NOT WASTE UR MONEY ON THIS . SORRY POLAROID FOLKS... THIS IS THE ONLY PRODUCT I THINK Polaroid SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF.
4,Semi permanent fun,"The photos from this camera are tiny but legible. Not for albums (unless your album is 2"" X 1"") but perfect for gatherings with friends & family. When I have a dinner party I take a photo of each person as they come in and use it as a placecard or name tag. Since the camera itself is inexpensive I don't mind if even the little kids want to play around with it and I let them take their own pictures. Watching the film develop is part of the fun."
2,Packaging,"I am extremely disappointed with the packaging. I ordered 5 NEW for Christmas presents and when I received them, they looked as though they were used. The package had been opened and re-taped, it was dirty and I am embarrassed to give them as gifts. I haven't used them yet because I thought that they would come with at least a trial film to get started, but the film is not included. I am praying that they work better than they look."
3,"Not quite successful, but Crumb keeps it interesting","R. CRUMB'S KAFKA is an odd mixture of biography and analysis illustrated in a variety of ways by the artist Robert Crumb. Not quite a satisfying read, with a few too many psychological evaluations by the author; the book does shine when Crumb illustrates his abridged versions of Kafka's work. The emotional detail of the drawings, where Crumb can focus on anger, lust, or terror, are excellent and are a fitting compliment to Kafka's tales of alienation. The text often just gets in the way becoming a distraction; Crumb's work is often fettered by trying to serve the text. A better book would have been a full blown adaptation of Kafka by Crumb without the forced psychological insights that would be a better fit for some master's thesis."
4,Kafka,"Kafka's life in itself is a very interesting tale, and I would recommend any book concerning the actual events of his life and the strange things that went through his mind. There are so many to choose from. From the multitude of books written about Kafka, R. Crumb's is actually a good addition. It provides something new to the world of Kafka, just as Maus provides something new to the WWII genre. It is sophisticated, intriguing, and downright creepy: definitely a great addition to your library."
1,Pure emotionalism,"This book is pure emotionalism in discussing race relations, particularly interracial relationships from Colonial times to the millennium. Ms. Stewart is engaging in pure emotion when it comes to this particular subject. This book is a divisive, not unifying at all. I recommend Randall Kennedy's Interracial Intimacies instead."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this item the other day and had hoped that it would do all that it claimed it would. The first night I used it, I had the tingling sensation that it stated I might experience. It lasted almost 20 minutes. Second night, I waited a bit longer after washing my face before putting it on, and still had some tingling, but not as long. I was noticing that my face was feeling extremely dry during this time. The next day I noticed my face was flaking all over and had an almost leathery feel to it... needless to say, I stopped using this product. My skin tends to be very sensitive to certain products, so perhaps this was just one of them... so if you are the same way, I would be very cautious about using this product on your skin. It's been several days since I discontinued it and I am still dealing with the very dry, flaky skin."
5,My girlfriend loves it.,"As the title says, my girlfriend loves it. She says she gets compliments from everybody when she wears it. Can't ask for any better than that."
4,PEACE IN CHINESE,"Very nice, good quality and looked just like the picture. The chain was too short for my grandson and small for a pendant this size. He didn't love it as much as I thought he would."
2,Quality not that great..........,I ordered from them and received the items pretty quickly. One of the bracelets I ordered was so tiny---for someone with a size 6 wrist and the beads were put on sloppily. I emailed them about it and they have not gotten back to me. I will not order from them again. Prices are great but quality is not.
2,To See the Background Scenes,"Of our special interest was ""Little Laura and Big John"" which was loosely based on the famous 'Ashley Gang' of eastern Florida from about 1912 to 1924. The filming for the movie was in Stuart, FL, our hometown. We were watching for the background scenes / locations and also for any local extras we knew.Having done a great deal of historical research on the Ashley Gang and especially when they died on Nov. 1, 1924 at the Sebastian Bridge by the 7-man Sheriff' posse ... there was a great deal of 'liberty' taken by the screen writer and director int he story they told. So, don't believe everything you see about the Ashley Gang and especially about Laura Upthegrove and John Ashley (as children). Too bad the writer didn't stick with the actual facts -- those were so much more interesting than their 'story line'.The other problem we had was the editing of the film ... it just didn't flow well."
5,Fab for the Beginning Actor or Professional without an Agent,"A MUST READ for any actor pursuing a career in New York. In particular, specific advice on how to get Soap Opera work and how to get an agent."
3,"Helpful, yet a bit typical","Brian O'Neil has put together a helpful guide for the beginner. Not much new here. For a more behind the scenes look, I'd suggest the far better ""New York Agent Book"" by K Callan. That book seems to have information that's new and straight from the ""horse's mouth"", so to speak. Still, this book may help one muster up enthusiasm to do yet another mailing...And will tell you how to do one properly, if you don't already know. It's also good if you aspire to work on soaps in any capacity (extra, under 5), and will tell you how to target the casting directors with-yep, you guessed it-mailings. A good guide for the beginner moving to New York."
3,DJ Green Lantern - Alive On Arrival Mixtape,"Not the best compilation of material from DJ Green Lantern that is available out there. The disc definitely includes a few bangers such as ""Got Me On My Shit"" by Jay-Z. Lantern thinks out of the box by taking lyrics from one of Jigga's old Blueprint Albums and lacing them with a beat from Wu-Tang Clan member The Genius/GZA's ""Shadowboxing"" beat, but he seems lazy in this effort as he fails to be as creative throughout the rest of the album. Other notable tracks to lend an ear to include up and coming artist Papoose with Mobb Deep, Busta Rhymes, and Juelz Santana of Dipset fame."
1,poor performance,This trimmer had very little power. I was not able to give my dog a haircut.I wouldn't recomment this product.
2,Cheers to the editor,"5:52 minutes into the video A1 for geni@l, the camera zooms in on a shot of a skeletal hand with its middle digit upraised. charming."
5,"J.S. BACH is the best;, for a contemprary genius, see GENIE","Despite the somewhat cheesy title, this is an amazing album.I put it right up there with my favorite relaxing muisc of all, the GENIE 4 CD set.Genie is, I believe, an AMISH artist who in my mind is the finest writer of this century."
4,Very soothing.,"Apart from the vocals, the rest of the music is so very pleasing to the ear. I loved it!"
5,Good for relaxing pregnant women,"I stumbled onto this album whilst searching bit torrent websites for classical music. I don't normally listen to classical music but thought it might be relaxing for my pregnant wife. After hearing the quality of the performances, the arrangement, and the recording I decided to buy the album from amazon. All the songs you would expect from a ""best album in the world"" are there and they are not boring to listen to like a lot of other classical albums. I now play this album in the car constantly and the wife requested it be played at the hospital during the birth."
2,"Similar to ""most Relaxing Piano anywhere""",I would like to delete about half of the truly unfamiliar tracks and possibly add a couple of better known more familiar works.
4,"Light a candle, grab a book, and play this CD","I love this CD. For the astute listener and keen critic of classical music, listening to excerpts from some of the world's greatest masterpieces may seem trite. However, if you're new to the art of classical music, this CD is for you! It provides a wonderful introduction to the ""classics"" and I think anyone who has never experienced a certain genre of music will greatly benefit from a ""greatest hits"" CD. The music is relaxing, the performances are adequate and I feel this CD was a worthy investment."
5,Just Glorious!,Very beautiful music! I have learned that you do not have to know the language to appreciate good music. Music is it's own international language!
1,Awful,"I hate any ""Classical"" CD that takes little snippits of this, and snippits of that, and puts them together so that they are relaxing. Here is an Example of what would happen if you did that to an english sentence, taking out parts of it here and there. ...Example of what... you did... to... an english sentence... parts of it here and there. It may not be the best example, but it gets the point across. It totally changed the meaning of the sentence. The same thing happens with music."
1,Awful...I regret wasting twenty bucks for this junk.,"I hate this, or should I say these 2 CDs. The songs are AWFUL, I regret wasting my money on it. Trust me, you're better off buying just plain Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Beethoveen, Bach, Pachelbel, etc. stuff. DO NOT buy this album, if you don't want to regret it. There are hardly any good songs here, except for a notable one here and there. But trust me, not worth a penny of your money."
1,Most Relaxing Classical Album deafeningly bad,The Most Relaxing Classical Album in the World has nerve frying soft music offset by disturbing operatic voices that sound like a saw on steel.I do not like this CD.
2,The Most Relaxing Classical Album in the World... ever!,"The album is okay, but I hardly feel it lives up to it's title."
5,GIVE THIS A LISTEN!,"This is a really nice collection of ""quiet"" classical music. Okay, purists...it's excerpts and we all know how you feel about that. Give it a rest, snobs! I bought the special with both volumes and both are incredible. There are different styles of music throughout (orchestral, piano, choral) but there is one central theme - every piece is beautiful. Sound quality is excellent and the editing was well done...the main themes of the pieces are intact. You'll find very familiar classical melodies throughout the collection. I was skeptical but delighted! Yes. I'm a former musician, have an elaborate sound system and an extensive collection of all types of music from Puccini to Pink Floyd."
4,Solid buy,"""Music, when soft voices die,Vibrates in the memory-""Percy Bysshe ShelleyMusic has a great power, and classical has to be the minds elixir. I've never met a classical album I didn't like, but this is one I would suggest to anyone. The variety and selection make it stand out among others like it. In the end, there is something left to be desired, but ...'C'est la vie'."
2,Selection: questionable - Recording: just OK - Performance: Average,"Of course taste is a very personal thing. But for me, these CDs don't really represent a good selection of classical music, the recording is just OK (not very high dynamics) and the performances are just average. Can't really recommend."
3,Everybody settle down.,"Crikey, people, let's all draw a deep breath and re-focus.Needless to say that there are vacuous yuppies out there wanting to impress their dinner party guests with this CD.But there are others, such as myself, who are thinking of purchasing this CD just to hear pleasant songs/melodies either attentively or *gasp* as background fare. And what's wrong with that? I know what I'm getting into. This is a ""greatest hits"" of languid classical music. I DON'T WANT to hear the whole symphony; if I wanted to do that I would buy the full version.Most folks wouldn't have a problem buying, say, Pink Floyd's greatest hits, yet there will always be someone with righteous indignation over taking ""Us and Them"" out of the context of The Dark Side of the Moon. It's a great song either way; enjoy it as you please.My advice to you all: Relax."
4,This Set is a Great Addition to a Classical Music Collection,"I was very pleased with the quality and variety of the works included with this two CD set. It includes many of the famous works by the best composers of the time period. The only thing I did not expect was to have some of the songs with choir-style singing. The majority of the music is just instrumental. I have several other classical CDs and two other compilation sets. This set is definitely one of my favorites. The price is also reasonable. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys relaxing, classical music."
3,Nice book but not complete,"This is the only affordable book on the DB7 that I could find. Although it gives the reader a nice history of Aston Martin and how the DB7 was created it still left me wanting more. He calims there were over 7000 DB7's built between 1994 and 2004. He doesn't give a year by year production figure. Nor do we know how many were sold in GB, how many were sold in North America and Europe. The author claims there were 20 standard colors available to pick from but never shows or lists the colors. Yes, I am aware for an extra cost you could order a DB7 in any color you want. There was no mention of the options available and how many were ordered. I understand he had access to the AML factory files and can't understand why accurate sales figures were not included. Also why did he cover the DB9? It just confused the issue and should have been left for another book."
5,Seeing Paris While Walking,"I prefer guidebooks that aren't just mammoth listings of everything (hotels, restaurants, sights). This compact book hits the target with its highlights and its walking tours.You get directions, maps and commentary. Boxed notes give relevance to much that you would unknowingly pass by. Boxed in sage green are SHOPPING TIPS and ENTERTAINMENT TIPS while RESTAURANT TIPS are boxed in dark green. This covers the sights on the Island and the 20 Arrondissements plus some further afield (Versailles, Disneyland Paris, etc.).The second part of the book details walks to take. Try the Islands walk, the Left Bank walk, the Marais walk, the major sights walk, the Montmartre walk, or some culinary walks. Sage green boxes highlight DETOURS to catch a special sight.I wish I'd had this on my first visit to Paris which I found quite expensive and a little overwhelming."
4,great book for introducing late children - pre teens into the past,"Ive read & own all the books from the Illustrated series from Hermes House. This book is sort of split into two parts, there are activities for childern (which was no interest to me) on the bottom of most pages, where they have projects to make and do, then the information part covering 70% of the page. I wasnt going to buy the book because of the activities, yet after reading a section at a bookstore, i noticed that there was alot of information that would interest a person of my age (25). While not heavy on detail, it does list all main points and facts, complete with picutres etc and covers a wide range of topics. Im very happy with it."
4,Lives up to reputation,"Well this knife is definatley sharp. I was able to dice an onion before the tears started. I have heard a lot about these knives and because of the price was very reluctant. However I paid double this price with alot of price comparing. I have sliced, diced and chopped everything I could think of with this knife, from chicken to zuccinni. It cuts everything with ease. You dont have to apply much pressure and the cuts were uniform and totally thru the food on the first pass. I sliced mushrooms and they didnt stick to the knife.( I was told that the little indentations keep food from doing this.) I would definatley recommend this knife. This price in my research is unbeatable. This knife is easly more than twice the $39.99 advertised here."
3,Works well but doubt the authenticity of it.,"The knife works well and I like it a lot. However, I have other Wusthof knives and they all have the ""X 50 Cr Mo 15"" stamped on the blade but this knife doesn't. I haven't taken it to an authorized dealer to verify the authenticity and I probably won't. You will get what you pay for. It's by no means a great deal where you're saving $40 or $50 compared to retail, but you will enjoy the knife."
5,Don't drop your keys,"Given the price I paid, this hat is surprisingly sturdy and well made. The grassy brim holds it shape well and is made out of sparkly green felt (like you might expect to find on a Elton John's pool table). Unfortunately, the soccer ball isn't quite spherical - it gets a bit deflated in transit and won't quite pop back to ball shape, but it's close enough.This hat makes a great accessory for a Halloween soccer field costume - green turtle neck and green sweats with a white half line, half-line circle and goal boxes painted on. Be warned, however; when you bend over to pick something up, kids will aggressively try to kick you in the head. So keep a tight grip on your keys.One size definitely fits all. The adjustable and stretchy head opening fit both my seven-year-old and my cartoonishly-massive melon."
3,Useful reference on euthanasia,One story outlines how the nurse allowed a cancer patient to die before alerting the Code Blue team to attempt resussitation.
3,Enjoy the Ride - Sugarland,"I loved their first CD! This one didn't quite live up to the first one, however. The lead singer's voice is still delightful and the CD is pleasant to listen to, but there is nothing outstanding about it. Maybe it will grow on me."
1,Disappointed in way item arrived!,"Case was cracked and the item was not new, as stated. Would not use company again! CD was in good shape but it was false advertising!"
5,Truly enjoyable ride!,"This album won't go down the history books as a classic...it probably won't even be nominated for album of the year...and it doesn't really threaten the first Sugarland release (that one was simply amazing!)...but this one takes you on a fun ride!Jennifer's voice is stronger; it is put on spotlight more than it was on the first and you hear her rise to the occasion, especially on the semi-acoustic track STAY. I love every song on the album (salute to Settlin' and Everyday America) except for Mean Girls - I find this one annoying, heck I even skip it.But a 5-star is a 5-star and I think this album deserves it!"
1,Ugh,"If not for Bon Jovi, this woman would not be famous.Can she try any harder to sound southern? She is SO fake. I feel an uncontrollable urge to change the station. A few of the songs they have are well written, and its too bad you have to tolerate her voice to hear them."
2,More pseudo-country garbage for the masses,"Here we go again... right along with acts like Keith Urban, Sugarland continues the trend of convincing the hit buying public into thinking they are listening to country music when they are really listening to glorified generic pop songs with hokey country twang. And speaking of twang, while Jennifer Nettles certainly has a capable voice (for pop music that is) the obviously forced drawl in her voice just makes it come off as corny. While Sugarland might do it for many music fans, they certainly don't do it for this one."
5,I love this voice!,"I am crazy about Jennifer Nettles! I love her energy,accent, and strong voice. Most of these songs showcase her talents very well."
5,enjoyable,"i am impressed with jennifer nettles by herself - she has one of those really unique voices, she can belt out the songs and portray the song she is singing. i believe she is putting heart and soul into her dream. i like the way the songs tell a story - like country music used to be. it is good clean music. not a disappointment!"
3,I enjoyed the last part of the ride,"The first part of the CD was so disappointing I almost didn't finish listing to it. From track 8 its really good. There are four really good songs on this cd that I listen to over and over, but I agree with another review, I miss the third band member. Their fist album was rockin and nearly got me a speeding ticket and had so much depth in the sound. Don't get me wrong, Jennifer has an amazing voice but its more solid sounding with the background vocals on the first album. The songs I like are April Showers, Sugarland, Stay, and Mean girls. Means girls cracked me up it was really funny, but not funny enough to carry the whole album. If your not asleep by track 8 you will enjoy the second part of the album."
4,sugarland enjoy the ride,the music was just what i was looking for the sound was excellent and i love it
4,How Can You Not LOVE Jennifer Nettles?,"While I thought Sugarland's debut was average; I really loved Enjoy the Ride! Between Jennifer's distinctive voice, the album's great lyrics, and a ""feel good"" vibe which is often missing in ""folk-country"" music - this cd was a welcome suprise. I really enjoy Sugarland when they are performing; they always seem to be having fun and really enjoy the songs they sing. I love it!"
3,Enjoy the Ride,This cd has a few great songs but they seem to blend together by the end of the cd! Not as exciting as I thought...
4,Sugarland,Good combination duet. I don't know much about them but I enjoy their music. Look forward to hearing more in the future.
5,Sugarland Rocks,I have just fallen in love with this cd! From the upbeat rockin songs to the slower paced heart-wrenchers this cd has a little bit of something for everyone. Jennifer Nettles has one of the most from the heart voices ever. When you get this cd remember this ain't ya mama's country music!! Hang on and enjoy the ride. It's well worth it.
4,Great range of their talents,This is a very representative compilation of the talents offered by this group. Spans from country to pop with distinct vocals and rythms.
5,Love this CD!,"Really great CD. All songs are wonderful. I only recently started listening to Sugarland. The first CD I bought was Love on the inside. I liked that so much, I got a couple of more Sugarland CD's and I was not disappointed! Truly great country songs."
5,perfect for a San Antonio / Austin swing,"Short and Sweet, I 'enjoyed the ride' several times over... I received the CD just before a one-week December stay in Austin and San Antonio. Packed this with some all-time favorite disks to listen to in our rental car, but these Sugarland songs got the most play by far of all the music I carried along. Perfect upbeat tunes for a great time spent in two Texas towns full of life! The stories on this Sugarland disk were almost like a soundtrack for a short trip spent growing friendships past previous boundaries. Buy it, and wear it out!!"
5,I Did Enjoy The Ride!,"The First time I heard ""Baby Girl"" I couldn't wait to hear it again, and that was how I felt when the first single ""Want to"" dropped from this new cd. However, there was plenty more of great songs where that came from and it's not always easy to Love songs on first listen but like ""baby girl"" this cd had plenty of them. ""Settlin"" and ""Happy Endings"" are two standouts as well. A wonderful 2nd ride with sugarland."
4,terrific CD,"I bought the CD for one song only that I had seen performed on an awards show but the whole CD is great. I personally cannot stand country music, but this reminds me a little of Melissa Etheridge."
4,Sugerland,I like the CD. It hasn't grown on me like the first CD yet but I am hopeful that it will! The music and lyrics are great. Nobody else like them!
5,Lovin' Sugarland,"This is a fantastic follow-up to ""Twice the Speed of Life."" I truly loved it. I definitely recommend it!"
4,Sugarland really rocks!,"I love this duo! It is great music, especially if you are a country music fan. Jennifer Nettles has a great voice. I love all the tracks except ""Mean Girls""."
5,Awesome. =),"I love this cd. It's got amazing songs and Jenifer's voice is just amazing. I love every song except for Mean Girls, her shouting is just kind of...strange, but other then that I love this cd. My favorite song would be One Blue Sky and Sugarland. The rest of the songs, Stay, Everyday America, These Are The Days, April Showers, County Line, Settlin' and Want To Are all amazing and I love them all.Go buy it!"
2,Not the same people,Apparently the lead singer was changed between a newer CD that I have and this one.That made a definite difference to me. My fault thought I should have researched it more!
2,Baby Girl is gone,"Bring back the true genius behind Sugarland's debut - Kirsten Hall. Without her unique songwriting skills and backing vocals the band moves into the Kiddie Rides arena. Coupled with this mainstream producer, we have just another Trisha Yearwood or Faith Evens and the rest of the crooners taking up space in the ""New Country"" panopoly."
5,Another Horner classic,"Another James Horner classic. The soundtrack is very lighthearted (especially the cafe scene). Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be on sale anywhere anymore. What a shame.Here are the tracks:Main TitleNight VisitorsHamburger RhumbaNew BabiesCafe SwingTime Square And FarewellArsonA New FamilyEnd Credits"
4,Good work but...,"Well. after hearing Guilty demo, I was expecting an amazing first album.. Actually WinterEnclosure is a good work but I expected something more... It has excellent tracks like the known one 'Lifelines in depht', that's an incredible song and there're another excellent songs too.. but there're another ones which are even similar (just in part) to Evanescense. That disappointed me a bit...Anyway it's better than many albums with that style and it reminds me The Gathering, during awesome Mandylion times.In spite of some details I recommend this album"
2,Disappointed,I am disappointed with the false advertising for this product. The site says buy one get one free and the free one would be automatically included. That is not the case. I only received one blanket. I expected more from Amazon and pb travel. I am hoping they resolve the issue. I was hoping to give these as gifts. I would have rated this product significantly higher if I received the product as promised.
5,Leon Redbone's Branch to Branch rocks!,"""Seduced"" is by far my favorite of Leon's tunes. I lost the CD when my house was pillaged by pirates (moving out indoor yard sale). I thought I had a digital copy, but I didn't Oh, well, I do now.Leon Jehosaphat Redbone was born October 29th, 1929 in New York City. On the way to the hospital, the car was struck on Wall Street by an unidentified object falling from a high ledge of the New York Stock Exchange. The cleanest of his father's utterances on that occasion was chosen as Leon's middle name. Luckily, his father had withdrawn the family's life savings the day before, in anticipation of a move after Leon's birth. Leon grew up with an eclectic mix of musical choices, which may explain why he is so hard to find in the music stores. The clerks give up on where to file him. Folk? Blues? (my choice) Why in hell he's in the ""Pop/Rock"" area, I'll never know..."
5,I Kinda Like It,"Every time I review a Leon Redbone I end up with the same idea... Magnificent! Which it ever is and always will be, thank you very much Leon. Can this boy sing? Holy moly, I'm a Rock'n Blues guitar and you name it banjo picker from Hell but I'd trade that all in a second for a voice like Leon Redbone. It doesn't ring, it doesn't shimmer, it just grabs ahold of yer soul and gives it an injection of 'this is the real thing' that you'll not soon forget. He doesn't ""rock"" in the traditional sense, but he damn sure rolls!"
5,Saved me a bundle,"This product saved me a bundle of cash and time. I had a troublesome coaxial cable problem that was intermittent in a section of 400 feet of buried cable. The Fluke TS-90 helped me to localize the problem to within 10 feet, the readings fluctuated probably because of the varying moisture conditions in the cable. I purchaed a Fluke Pro3000 Toner and Probe to get a more accurate fix of the problem, but that was no help. Using the TS-90 initial location indications I went to the nearest old cable splice; I respliced and sealed the cable junction and the problem totally disappeared. I am very happy with the TS-90 because I was able to locate the cable problem without several cable excavations or splicing operations."
5,Shaham's Performance Is Exquisitely Rhapsodic,"This fine CD is my introduction to Gil Shaham's excellent violin playing. I'm stunned by the beautiful, warm tone he produces from his violin. Surely these are among the finest performances I have heard of Bartok's works for the violin and orchestra. Boulez leads a clinical, yet lyrical, performance of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra that is full rate, yet not quite as compelling as those I've heard with Boulez conducting the Cleveland and London Symphony orchestras in his Deutsche Grammophon recording of the Ravel Piano Concertos. Still, this is a minor criticism of what is otherwise a superb CD. Of course, the sound quality is absolutely impeccable, thanks to Deutsche Grammophon's state-of-the-art digital recording."
3,Dull performance of a great concerto,"Boulez has conducted some very fine performances of Bartok's music, but this recording of the 1938 violin concerto is not one of them. With the exception of the last movement, which has some animation, this is a dissection. Solti's performance with Chung is a much better bet."
3,So far so good,"I have not had the quality issues that some of the reviewers have experienced. I have had it installed and working for about a week. So far, so good. One, complaint, the installation instructions are junk. Poorly written and hard to follow. The instructions are in two parts, one for regular windows and one for casement windows. So, they both cover many of the same things. However, the instructions differ in area's that have nothing to do with window type. Also, some of the instructions are just wrong. For example, there is a plastic sheet that must be cut if your window height is too tall. The instructions tell you to cut along the wrong side of the rectangular sheet. Big mistake.I would have expected much better from Frigidaire."
2,Needs better engineering.,Unit had poor instaltion instruction. Also unit is too noisy for sleeping even on low fan. Compresser makes loud bang when it stops.
3,Frididaire Air Condiitoner,"The product is fine, but the delivery was terrible. The unit was beat to hell with dings and huge dents all over. We have to pop out the dents in order to install it.I would have returned it, but it was so hot and the unit was needed immediately."
3,Packaging not suitable for shipment,"Per other reviews, packaging for this unit is not suitable for shipment, mine arrived with a broken face place, and bent mounting components. Little surprise given the box is not suitable for UPS style shipping, very little protection for the unit. Unit itself is suitable for our needs, with no too much noise."
1,Failure after two repairs.,"We had a compressor failure after the first mild NW winter here in Portland Oregon. I just turned it on again today and we have another failure in the compressor bearings. It's unfixable, unless you want to replae the compressor again, and now out of warranty. I would not reccomend this air conditiner to anyone.There is a quality problem."
5,frigidair,"Arrived in 3 days, since I needed it ASAP and Amazon said it would take two weeks but redeemair said they would send it asap to arrive in 3 days which it did. Works great and came exactly on time."
4,Frigidaire casement AC unit,"The service was great, but this item is a little to heavy to ship easily."
5,Beautiful bracelet,The pink ribbon bracelet was purchased as a gift for a breast cancer awareness event. The bracelet was very nice and very appreciated by the one who won the bracelet. Thanks!
3,nice 'cheap' bracelet,"I purchased the bracelet as a secret santa gift. It is a really nice bracelet for the price. But within 5 minutes a stone fell out on the rhinestone ribbon on the heart charm. I looked at Michaels for a replacement stone but they had nothing. How aggrivating.Buy cautiously--if the stones don't fall out you will be really happy with the product! :) It really is a cute bracelet for the price.*Also, it took a little while, but the seller does make you happy and will reship a new bracelet out if there is an issue."
3,Very pretty but cheap.,This looks very nice but is made cheap. The fake stones in the ribbon popped out and it has fallen off my wrist twice and luckily people have found it for me each time.
3,breast cancer awerness bracelet,"i got this bracelet for my sister fighting breast cancer, she loved it and everyone else too but i was not. it's very beautiful but when i held it it felt so fake and cheap, wish i would of know :/"
5,breast cancer bracelet,This bracelet is great to give to someone who has had cancer. Good quaility for the price. Love all items made by this company.
3,Doesn't work as well as expected.,The product but doesn't work as well as expected. Recommended use for an extra large load is 14 oz. It leaves a lot of residue on the respirator lenses. I am now using 6 oz. per load...still some residue but better than with the larger amount of soap.
4,A good foundational book on research papers,"This is a good book for obtaining a basis understanding of research papers. It starts with the basis concepts of a research article. What is research, what is the question, who answered the question, etc. Then proceeds into the core of introduction, method, results and discussion."
3,"Interesting, simplified","This is not a bad book for research theory, not one of the best, nor one of the worst. It is relatively simple and easy to read."
5,Very good chart,Useful chart of the central chesapeake. Its as current as can be expected and is waterproof and a handy size to have on the boat. Shows useful bottom features including many of the well known wrecks.
3,meh,"This is a solid, well-made foam backrest and the indent for the body is a nice touch, except that then it prevents a real upright position with lower-back support. Also, the cover that came with it is really thin/cheap."
2,"No ""comfort""","This ""comfort"" wedge is not comfortable at all. It is too hard; it provides no support for the lower back (lumbar); it provides no support for the neck (cervical). Returning it."
4,Great pillow. I use it every night!,I love it and am very glad I bought it. The only down side is that the upright position is too upright with me and uncomfortable. I do use the lower position to read all the time and love it. The curled sides is great and feels very snug. The texture/bumpiness is great!
3,"Pillow's OK, But the Cover is Not","The wedge pillow is ok--just ok, but the poly/cotton cover is very thin and I doubt it will take even one washing. I certainly would not want to put my head on it. This wedge is best suited for helping to sit in an upright position, but I'd look elsewhere if you plan on using it to elevate your head while sleeping"
3,Good idea but not pulled off 100%,"I felt that this product was a bit overpriced and that there were some flaws in its construction. For some reason, it always ""scruntches"" up on the bed, as it is simply a lightweight piece of foam, not a dense enough foam to have the heft to stay in one place. It is also very narrow. The angle it rises, however, is sufficient for the acid-reflux problems to go away. Therefore, it does the job intended MOST of the time, but not all of the time because sometimes it gets pushed out of the way at night because it is so lightweight. The narrow nature of the pillow means that it is not as comfortable as it could be."
2,not well designed,"I don't know why the sides are curved. It makes it tight and hard to read in bed, It's very hard as well. I'm sorry I purchased it. will try to find a box to ship it back."
2,Too narrow to be comfortable,"This pillow is good quality, and it is soft enough to be comfortable. The problem with the pillow is that it is narrow. I bought this for my fiance who suffers from congestive heart failure and has trouble breathing at night. He is not a large man, but he cannot fit comfortably on this pillow. Either his arms dangle down off the sides of the pillow (which is uncomfortable) or he has to cross them over his chest like a vampire in a coffin. I have the same problem on the pillow, and I am only 5' 6"" and weigh 120 lbs. Ultimately it would cost me too much to ship it back for it to be worth getting a refund, but it is useless to us. If you are very narrow shouldered, or if you are buying this for a child or adolescent it would likely be perfect, but it just isn't practical for a normal-sized adult."
2,Comfort Wedge,"Foam parts started to come apart at glue sites after a week of use. Other than the construction, a great idea. Would NOT buy again from this manufacturer."
2,Curve much too drastic,I purchased this pillow to use while pregnant and struggling with issues of heartburn and general discomfort while sitting/lying in bed. I found this wedge to be comfortable only if I put another bed pillow on top of it. The curve shape was much more pronounced than I had hoped and I found the slope of it to be too low to provide the adequate support and elevation I was hoping for. It did have a nice balance of firmness/soft but I really did not like the indented shape and felt like I was trapped in a ditch! I'm returning it for the similiar wedge shown on Amazon.com that does not have the indentation.
3,Pregnancy,I bought this for use during pregnancy and mild sleep apnea. Very good for pregnancy but not so ell with the apnea.
3,"LCD monitors must be at native resolution to be not ""fuzzy""","Reading the above review, I wonder if the reviewer has her resolution set to 1280x1024. That's the native resolution of the LCD, and if it is set to something else, like 1024x768, it will look fuzzy. All LCD monitors do."
1,"Poor quality, dead pixels","Very poor quality. Text is often fuzzy and I get a headache from using it. It has lots of dead pixels, too. This monitor sucks. I should have gone for a Viewsonic for lower price. Don't buy this or you'll be wasting your money and doing harm to your eyes."
1,A very boring book written poorly,Save your money on this one. I read it in less than a hour and found it contains about as much details as this situation as nothing.Itlacked details of the important American occurance and really I feel a trash can is where it belongs.
4,Very moving...,"I enjoyed this book .I liked the down to Earth writing style in which she related her story.I am always interested in hearing about peoples experiences at Columbine.To me the best part of the book was when Marjorie related personally seeing Dylan Klebold being picked on and harassed in the Halls at Columbine.That first person account was very detailed, and touching and means so much to me.I also commend her for acknowledging the pain of E and D's families and expressing sympathy towards them.I wish Marjorie a lot of luck and success in the future and I thank her and her Mother for sharing her story."
3,One Girl's Experiences,"Marjorie Lindholm describes her experiences before, during and after the Columbine shooting. The book reads like a conversation. I admire Marjorie for her determination. I appreciate that this is a book she felt she had to write, and I think it will be interesting to lots of people. I just want to warn everyone that if you're trying to satisfy your morbid curiousity, look elsewhere. This book does have a chapter or two that takes place during the shooting, but mostly it's about Marjorie's life after the tragedy and how it was different. The story isn't told in scenes. It's told in summary. But I found myself really relating to Marjorie so I could understand why she wrote this. It's mostly meant for those who want to know more about the real life ripple effects of this horrible crime."
4,Good book,"Marjorie lets the reader see inside a very personal story, her life and past, and a first hand account of what really happened at Columbine. It was very moving to get a little view of what took place that day. It was an easy read, but very conversational language."
2,nothing new,I give this two stars because there is nothing new here but that doesn't mean that what's on this CD is not good. Everything Basia performs is GREAT and she is a five-star artist. I own all of her CDs including the ones with Matt Bianco so it's time for something else new and wonderful!
5,Basia is the BEST!,"I love Basia's music. It inspires me ,it calms me,it makes me happy. We'e seen her in concert twice. What a voice!"
2,dissapoint,i am very dissapoint of this cd. the music and versions are boiring and without imagination. dont buy this cd
3,Intriguing concept and at times entertaining gay fantasy,"The premise of being able to metamorphose into another body/amimal reminded me of the sixties TV series ""Bewitched"". Set in San Diego, Russ has this ability and uses it to cruise a varierty of good looking men. A little like Hanif Kureishi's The Body, an entertaining concept does start to get repetitive. Elf Child does entertain at times but the stereotypical gay cruising situations were annoyingly predictable. This is a light read but there was an underlying theme that people who are different are often persecuted and so have to hide their true selves. A very often used theme but this was an interesting new slant."
4,a very good read !,russ a changling falls for eric and discovers love while lizzy his over a hundered year old mother worries what might happen if there secret gets out the story travels over lizzys (russes mother) fear of discovery and why to russes discovery of love and honesty to a gay bashing and some incredible detective work bye erics mom as she trys to discover her sons lovers secret its very touching and telling story with just the right amount of fantasy of a an elf child who loves a mortal man i liked this book enough to write a review the first ive ever writen and i have bought many books on amazon if you like romance and fantasy this a book for you i recomend it highly
5,"""I miss you"" .....","I went to school with Lloyd Turner and Kelvin Bradshaw and watching them in our high band was a treat in itself. When their album dropped back in the day I was proud to say ""I know those guys"".""Special kind of fool"" is still my jam 'til this day and I have been searching high and low for a copy of this CD.""Skip"" & Kev, man I miss ya'll and with the talent you guys had I feel the world should still be hearing you, it was pure, clean and just fun. I miss you.Bridget JCHS Class of '86"
4,Special Kind of Fool...,"...is a rarity that classic R & B radio fails to play. I love it a lot. Additionally I'll Do Whatever You Want should have been a hit, but who knows what happens from the studio to the radio playlists? Now, can everyone finally tell the difference between Gene Griffin's New Jack 90's style and Teddy Riley's style? This will help you discern them."
5,A love story in words,I am ole skool but when i heard this song I lost it!! I said d...yum what a great tribute to a woman from a man who is basically saying str8t up!! I am a fool for you..I love you. I pray that the artist is still in love with her..and that he is not a fool.. good job there is nothing like telling it like it is
4,WHATEVER IT TAKES,"THE GOOD OLE NEW JACK SWING DAYS.I WAS STILL ON ACTIVE DUTY IN NORFOLK,PARTYING CONSTANTLY,AND THIS WAS ONE OF MY PARTY STARTERS.SHE'S MINE WAS ALWAYS GUARUNTEED TO GET ME ON THE DANCE FLOOR.SHE'S MINE,ALONG WITH NOTHING BUT A PARTY WERE PARTY STARTERS.WHEN IT WAS TIME TO GET CLOSE THEN THERE WERE NOW OR NEVER,BABY CAN WE TALK,AND ONE OF THE BEST SLOW JAMS EVER MADE SPECIAL KIND OF FOOL.PERSONALLY MY FAVORITE UPBEAT SONG IS ONE OF THE MOST SLEPT ON SONGS EVER,WHATEVER IT TAKES.I NEVER CONSIDERED BASIC BLACK A GUY CLONE,AND I FEEL IT WAS A SHAME THAT THEY BOWED TO THAT PRESSURE INSTEAD OF CONTINUING TO MAKE GOOD MUSIC,BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY MEMORABLE ALBUM TO ME."
5,Bob's Opinion,"The product arrived in a very timely maner. I have had it for a while now and used it often. The last time I tried to use it about a week ago, it stopped working. I think it is the cord. It does not sync any more. There is power to the PDA, but the button doesn't sync it. That disappoints me, but I have had it for about a year, so I really can't complain. I would really like to order another one, but just haven't taken time. I would certainly recommend this product and the supplier to any of my friends. Thank you. BOB'S OPINION"
3,Story Good Book bad.,"My daughter ordered this book for the story, which she says is awesome. However, upon opening the book the glue on the binding fell apart and the pages seperated from the spine and cover. So, if you order this book, be prepared to need a binder to put the pages into as they fall out."
1,Doesn't fit,"I have a Trek Navigator, a hybrid bike. The rack simply didn't fit. My bike has the pre-threaded holes, but the rack frame was too narrow for my bike frame. I ended up having to modify the installation by cutting and drilling the bracket pieces. But once I got it installed, it works great. If I had not had the tools and an engineering background, I could not have installed this rack."
3,Instructions SUCK! May need more parts. Quality piece,"Like many have stated, the instructions suck. However, it is a very nice piece once it's installed. Be sure to check and see if you have the installation holes below your seatpost, as you may need a seat post part to install the arms up top.Once installed, it is a really nice piece. Very light, rugged, and looks nice."
3,Its Ok. But expected more,"The spring is not that tight. When I keep my bag at the back it always tends to slide to the side.Rest is pretty good. It is very sturdy, easy to fix"
4,May not be compatible with hybrids,"I bought this for my Fuji Crosstown 2.0 hybrid to commute to school.The seat stay brackets (arms that attach to the bike near the seat)are too short which causes the rack to tilt forward on my bike. Unless you have the resources to fabricate your own brackets I recommend looking elsewhere if you want this rack for a hybrid bike. Overall, the rack is very nice and installing it is very doable if you just fiddle around with it a bit."
4,"Cannondale riders, beware","Two complaints about what is generally a very good product: 1) I have the same complaints everyone else has about the instructions--they're just about worthless; and 2) I have a Cannondale Adventure 3 and found that the bottom pieces of the rack (the part that adjusts based on the bike's size) are too fat to make it possible to screw them into the frame of the bike. I had to use thin wire, similar to what you'd use to hang pictures, to tie the rack to the bike via the holes in the frame."
1,Doesn't Fit Trek 7.2 FX,"This rack won't fit on my Trek 7.2 FX. The little arms on the front are too close together to fit on the bike. I managed (with serious force) to contort them on, but one of the bolts fell off after about a month. I'd recommend getting a decent rack from a real company that's able to put actual instructions with their product."
2,Check For Compatibility with other Bike Accessories,"This rack has a nice powder black finish and feels really sturdy. It also seems to be greatly adjustable to fit whatever bike frame you might have. However, for a novice bicyclist, the instructions were way too brief and I could not figure out how in the world to get it on my bike. It ends up I had to return the rack anyway, though, because it was not compatible with the rear bike basket I bought in the same order - the basket is a Top Peak rear basket with a nice clip in feature, but you need to have their special back rack for it to clip into. It would have been nice if Amazon had information about required pieces and compatibility."
4,Sunlite Bicycle Rear Rack,"I am happy with the Sunlite Bicycle rear rack. The only reason I did not rate it 5 stars is because the instructions for installation were not helpful at all. After reading other reviews, I just looked at the pictures on-line and figured it out from there. It is very solid; I think it's going to work out great."
4,Light weight,"It is light, durable and easy to install (sort of) if you know how to do it. Instruction is useless as many reviewers said. One thing I wish to be included is mudstopper in the kit. Since we are going to add a rear rack, it would make sense to have mudstopper installed as well."
4,Very Good Rack,"I installed this rack on a Specialized Cross Trail. The bike is a 700c and the frame is wide enough for disc brakes. (My particular bike doesn't have disc brakes.) I had to spread the uprights open a little to fit the width.The rack is solid and doesn't rattle. I use it to carry a set of panniers with another bag bungeed to the top. The sides make for very useful attachment points and keep the panniers from hitting the wheel.It ships with enough hardware of varied sizes to fit many bikes. The height adjustment for the uprights fits bikes from 26-29"" and locks securely."
2,eh...,"So... everything seemed to be in order. I got the product relatively quickly, and it looks quite nice. I mounted the little arms on the bike and then went to mount the rack on the bolt holes near the rear axle... and the bolts didn't fit. the holes on the bike are too big for the bolts that came with the rack. So... attempt one at mounting the rack: unsuccessful. I'll go buy additional hardware (bolts) tomorrow (losing points sunlite...) and see if I can mount that bad boy. It was a big dissapointment. And the instructions are quite a joke. Mine came with one picture and vague, relatively worthless instructions. I think that trying to figure them out would take more time than just putting the rack on without them.I'll update the post based on what happens with the new bolts."
1,Give me a break,What??? No instructions on how to hook up the bottom part of the rack!!!! what if my bike does not have the mounting screws factory installed??? This is definitely a mistake for me to buy this garbage!!! It is not universal at all..Dumb crap!!!!
1,Avoid,This purchase is my first disappointment dealing with an Amazon vendor. Do not waste your money on this item. Why? Because:a. This item has small pieces that are easy to loseb. Assembly requiredc. Assembly instructions are sparse and written by someone for whom English is a third languageItems which require assembly really should have instructions written by someone who understands English if sold in an English-speaking country.
5,Good Bike Rack,"I recently purchased the Sunlite bike rack, and have been pleased. I replaced my old rack with it and have been very satisfied. The spring loaded clamp is useful as are the numerous ways you can bungie various things to be carried."
2,Had some issues with this.,"This is a nice rack with a sleek look to it and the bag I bought to go with it fits nicely.That being said, the rack was not all that easy to install. The hardware did not include brackets in the chance that your bike doesn't already have pre-drilled holes for the support arms, I had to go to a bike shop to get these. The brackets that you tighten to adjust the height of the frame, what they call ""spring retention systems"", easily stripped thus the frame would not stay in place. I ended up, after dealing with it for hours, going to a bike shop and having them drill permanent holes into the bottom brackets so that it would stay in place.After all the headache that this rack brought me over the past couple of days, I am glad that I had the guys at the bike shop drill the holes and secure the frame for the extra $20. It would of cost more to send it back and wait for another one to come in. Choose your rack wisely and maybe have it professional installed."
2,bad approach,"Creating a ""science-faction"" novel is the worst thing that can happen to an allegedly true information. It makes me think twice before I buy anything from Brad Steiger again."
3,A little bit too shallow,"The story is more suited for a movie. That would be cool. The concepts are great but the story line is weak. There was one good chapter: Offensive Security. That's the way the entire book should have been written. The items of interest went by too fast and too simplistically.After reading some of the in-depth free stuff on the net, this book was a let down. But since it is one of the ""biggies"", I reccommend that you buy it too and make up your own mind about the book (not the ideas behind the book)."
5,I read this outstanding novel and bought 3 more for friends.,"This is the most exciting book I've read in years. I stumbled across Alien Rapture-The Chosen, while looking for books on aliens on the Amazon web site. I bought it because I had read two other books by Brad Steiger, and I liked them both. What a story! I read the book in two sittings, staying up almost night to finish it. I think Edgar Fouche' knows exactly what he is talking about, even though I realize that parts of the book--the end for example--are fiction. However, I think it could possibly happen just like the author said it did. I have wondered about the alien involvement on our earth for a long time, and I think everyone should read this book. Something is going on, it seems as if the government is trying to hide it, and I think the people have a right to know. Thanks to Edgar Fouche' and Brad Steiger for writing Alien Rapture. I highly recommend it."
5,A Page Turner Filled With Real Secrets!,"""A while back I heard Mike Murphy on KCMO tell his guest Brad Steiger that ALIEN RAPTURE was absolutely the best book that he had ever read on UFOs. I finally got around to reading the book, and I agree with Murphy. This remarkable work will shock you and open your eyes to the real story behind the UFO mystery.The real story of Fouche, the Top Secrets he reveals, and the novel have been featured on 'The Learning Channel,' Discovery,' and hundreds of radio programs that I know of.His co-author Brad Steiger is famous for his research on UFOs and the paranormal. His Project Blue Book was a best seller. Steiger is a genius and he's published more than 150 books, both fiction and nonfiction. So, ignore the lame reviews. My friends all loved this book."
2,NOTHING NEW HERE,"When the real evidence finally comes out, if it ever does, I suspect it will not be in the form of witness testimony. The public needs physical evidence, which this book provides none. In addition, the story barely kept me interested in turning to the next page. Sorry, didn't like it."
1,Usual stuff,"I was expecting a good science fiction book (look at the price)...to read through the weekend, however, it was like reading a very cheap and fast written novel. Usual conspiracy stuff."
4,The Art of the Possible,"All of these 13 pieces are short solos designed to draw out the best in the player and to explore all of the sounds each instrument is capable of creating. They are profoundly difficult to play (especially the sequenza for flute)and may be equally difficult for some listeners to enjoy. (My advice is to try repeated listenings until the impact of each piece can be understood.) What Berio has shown us are the possibilities of each instrument which in turn will inspire composers of the next century to compose music that challenges the ensemble to push their instruments beyond the norm. Truly, this 40 year project could potentially have as much of an impact on future composers as the 2nd Viennese School did earlier this century."
5,A different perspective,"I 'm a city girl and though I was raised in Kansas, I know little about the argricultural market. This book was an eye opener. The author's premise is sound and believe me, it took a lot of convincing on his part to bring me to this point.Let's stop feeding the poorer nations with our ""surpluses."""
1,Just another romance author now BUT with no desire to write,"I am/was a Susan Johnson fan but the last 4 or 5 books are clueless (I'm sorry Susan). I loved my education I used to get when reading your material but now it's just so so. I gave it a ONE STAR for Susan Johnson but maybe I would have given it a 4 STAR if I didn't know how well she can write. I don't think she wants to write anymore & just satisfies her contract with a book company. I collect her books, have many originals, but I don't know how long I will continue to do so. I agree with another reviewer....go back to your roots."
5,its pretty cool,"This toy is actually pretty cool, if you luanch your fly wheel to far away from the ramp its not going to jump that high.But if you luanch it close enough its really cool."
4,Fun for the kids,"My son plays with monster trucks all the time and he loves the ramp. We had another one, but it broke when he stood on it so I am not sure how durable they are but they are still fun either way."
3,!?!?!?!?!?!?,i dont get it i dont have a ramp yet cause i jus got the wheel but am i retarded and cant launch the wheel or do all the wheels practically spin off to the right cause if i do get the ramp ill never hit it and if i do itll go flying off my driveway into a forest and theres a waste of $5 but i dunno it mite work if you have an entire parking lot
1,THIS BOOK LACKS MAGIC,I cannot understand how this book is a national bestseller. I thought the book was boring. It is extremely detailed especially when it comes to the dream sequences in the book. This book could have been condensed 100 pages to get to the main highlights. The ending fell short and did not bring any kind of closure to the characters in the book.
3,The Magician's Assistant,"I was completely enthralled by Ann Patchett's State of Wonder and by her Bel Canto, but when I read The Magician's Assistant I was appalled by the number of misspelled words and typos in the text. Who edited this book? The errors were a real distraction to me, example: feces instead of faces. The story line of the book is quite good, but the ending is very abrupt. I gave it 3 stars."
2,Kind of a drag,"I love Patchett's writing style. Unfortunately, it carried me through this story that otherwise I would have long abandoned. The L.A. characters - Sabine and Parsifal and Phan - were all relentlessly perfect. The plot was dull. The ending was absurd. The Nebraska characters were a little more interesting, but with no plot for context, that didn't help much."
1,Shamefully bad editing - riddled with typos,"I don't know if the print version is similarly flawed but the kindle version of this book is so full of typos that I believe I deserve a refund. My favorite typo thus far: ""the twenty two feces of famous people staring vacantly in her direction""The problem is pervasive enough to interfere with the meaning of the text. This is a decent and interesting book (though not Patchett's best) but the kindle version is substandard and should be pulled and corrected. It's just ridiculous."
3,Great book but Kindle edition loaded with typos,"I have come to accept typos in free or $.99 Kindle publications, but when I pay $9.66, I expect the proof reading to have been done by a human, not a computer checker. There are way too many typos, some impossible to decipher, and I agree with another reviewer that we should be offered a refund or a print version in exchange."
2,wonderful book hindered by tons of misspellings and copywriting errors,"This is a very good book. However, I really can't recommend the Kindle version as it is absolutely chockful of copyediting and spelling errors. As an example, early in the print book Sabina drives past 20-foot-tall faces on billboards; in the Kindle edition, it's ""20-foot-tall feces."" Do yourself a favor and buy the print version. These errors are very annoying and distracting after a while, and given that the Kindle edition isn't exactly cheap, I believe they're unacceptable."
4,quite magical,"I didn't think I was going to enjoy this book -- but in the end it definitely grew on me and ultimately touched me.It's definitely written in a muted tone. The protagonist, the assistant of the title, is sunk in depression after the death of her two gay friends, one of whom was her husband. She sleeps a lot -- but she has sleepwalked through most of her life, settling for the illusion of love instead of the real thing. Her role as the assistant has been to stand there and smile sweetly while he does all the real living and loving.Surprisingly, only when she travels to snow-bound Nebraska to bond with her dead husband's famly does the book come truly to life. It becomes clear this is a book about family and about the possibility of love -- the love that holds families together and the love that binds two people together, true love, the real thing, not the illusion.Worth persisting with."
2,Underwhelming,"I was a big fan of Patchett's beautiful, understated Bel Canto. This book had an intriguing setup: a woman is married to a magician who loves her but is gay. After he passes away, she learns that the family he claimed was dead is actually still alive.Unfortunately, once that mystery is resolved, which doesn't take long, Patchett seems to run out of interesting ideas. To be fair, her characters are likable, plausible people, and she has a talent for lovely, understated scenes. But, the story loses much of its tension as soon as the closet runs out skeletons, and turns a little too sentimental. Patchett even goes as far as to include the stilted device of the dead magician giving advice to the protagonist in dreams. This one fell well short of Bel Canto for me -- I do recommend that book if you haven't read it yet."
2,Ending leaves a lot to be desired,"It took awhile for me to get through this book. The writing was okay, but it was not one of those ""I can't put this book down"" type. I hated the ending. It left me empty. I expected a lot more. What happened with the plot? I felt like the storyline was all over the place and not centered. It just seemed to jump all over the place. It's like trying to put a puzzle together and you find that you have lost one or two pieces of it to make it complete. Very disappointing indeed."
3,I can't believe it turned out this way!,"I loved this book up until the last 50 pages. I thought the characters and relationships were beautiful. But, I was shocked by the end of the story. The characters that had been so exceptionally described throughout the book fell apart for me at the end. The book I could not put down, I would not recommend to anyone. Very disappointing!"
1,Wishful thinking and regional bias!,"Let me get this straight: life after death is beautiful and the dead can visit their loved ones (not to mention foreign countries) in dreams; the Midwest is the only place with child/spousal abuse; Los Angeles is a paradise and THE hope for suffering people (sunshine, ocean, tolerance, and fresh limes? Hmm, I always think smog, crime, and earthquakes.) I would not recommend this to anyone living outside of LA."
2,Dragged on and on.....,I did not care about these characters at all. I did not feel any sympathy for the woman who was in love with a man who could not love her back in a passionate and romantic way. It seemed so strange to me that a woman could be so obsessed with a man that she would actually marry him and live with him and his lover for years. The story jumped all over the place between dreams and reality.No one should be ashamed of theiri sexuality and hide it. I got the impression that was what the characters in this book did.I can understand maybe not being truthful to society but if you are not true to yourself what kind of satisfaction can you get from your life? I think it would be naive to think anyone could and this book proves it. If this is someone's idea of reality they have wasted their life.
2,A disappointment compared to Bel Canto,"I loved, loved Bel Canto and so was expecting great things from Ann's prior book. However, I was disappointed. The plot was a little too contrived and unbelieveable, and I didn't find it inspirational at all, like Bel Canto could be. Just depressing."
3,a novel without plot,"This book contains lovely prose which does little to save it from the lack of plot. The magic is ludricrous and does not progress the story. There are no characterisations and thus the characters are one dimensional. I held no sympathy for any of them and found it all so laconic that I waded through it just seeking a pulse that eluded me. So if no characters, no structure, no plot, little dialogue and over 300 pages of depression interest you then its a fine read screaming for an editor."
3,a nice story,The Magician's Assistant kept my interest and was a nice story. Only thing that had me confused was the relationship near the end between Kitty and Sabine.
2,Disappointment In the Reading,"After the reviews I had read for this book, I expected suspense and mystery; a real page turner. I found instead a thoughtfully crafted journey of discovery for a woman who had comitted herself to a homosexual man and his lover. Ms. Patchett paints detailed pictures of Sabine's quest, but the process of her explorations is less an Agatha Christie than a feature on ""The View"". Plus, if you don't like LA you'll find its loving descriptions thereof to be tedious."
1,Ann Patchett Lacks Magic,"I wanted to like this novel, but I just couldn't. Like all of Patchett's other works, this one is boring and hard to read. After I bought the book and read it, I felt like I had been tricked by an evil magician. I felt like an unwilling participant at a magic show--the lady who gets sawed in half. The plot is jerky and lackluster; it's predictable and rather dull. The characters are slippery and distant. There is no energy, no rabbit out of the hat. It's a one woman show where the magic is missing. It deserves a zero but the marks don't go quite that low."
4,"If you like Anne Tyler, check this out","After getting over my initial bewilderment of a straight woman character knowingly marrying a gay man and obsessing over him long after his death, it all was made plausible as Patchett weaved this reader into another well told story. Filled with a colorful cast of characters based in L.A. and Alliance, Nebraska. I have become more and more a fan of Ann Patchett's work. Her stories are nicely diverse and spread out all across the human spectrum.Her extended dream sequences don't make a lot of sense to me, and I thought bogged down the pace on this one, still I enjoyed the book as a whole. I like the subject a lot, ""families with major issues"". Reminded me of Anne Tyler (high praise), and just as good."
2,I Kept Hoping It Would Get Good,"Alas, it did not. I really wanted to like this book. I like Bel Canto with exception for the absurd (in my opinion) ending. Maybe I just did not understand the main character at all. While I understand her motivations to learn about her husband's family I never made the leap to an understanding of her decisions prior to the start of this book. It seemed like such a strange and sad illusory way to live. And I truly felt sorry for the fact that she was so in love with this man that could not possibly love her in the same way. I also predicted the way this one ended about half way through the book...so sorry no good plot twists and turns along the way. This was easy and not really that interestin."
5,LOVED this book!,"Quite frankly, I bought this book because it had a rabbit on the front, and I'm an avid rabbit lover. But I ended up loving this book, mainly because I could relate to her grief (I'm a widow, too). And the quirky ending, that makes you wonder, did she and Kitty ever really get together..., was great. I thought all the characters were very human and likable, and you felt compassion for the position that all of them found themselves in, due to what happened so many years ago. Not to mention, as a rabbit lover, the random notations about the rabbit were charming, i.e., on Page 182, when Sabine calls home to her dad in LA, and he says, ""Guess who's sitting here in my lap, helping me read the newspaper?"" And Sabine says, ""You'll spoil him."" And her dad's response is, ""No such thing as a spoiled bunny. This is an animal who possesses an infinite capacity for affection."" Loved it!"
4,More than you bargained for...,"After knowing her husband over 20 years, Sabine finds herself alone. ""Parsifal is dead. That is the end of the story."" Yet it is only the beginning of Sabine's poignant journey to find who her husband truly was and what she needs to become in order to go on without him. This story isn't just about a magician's assistant, but the everyday magic that people work on each other to improve their outlook on life. The magic of everyday miracles that people become so accostumed to that they overlook--the magic of friendship and family."
4,"A book of unusual, complex characters.","Sabine's husband, Parsifal the Magician, suddenly dies unexpectedly. After 20 years in a most unusual union, Sabine thinks she knows all there is to know about her former mate. However, she soon finds out that smoke and mirrors were Parsifal's stock-in-trade on many fronts. As she comes into contact with the family her husband strove so hard to conceal, she finds others trying to sort out a different sort of grief Parsifal left behind in Nebraska. As Sabine and Parsifal's family try to understand the dynamics of Parsifal's lives with the other party, one can almost see the way to healing and redemption for at least some of those involved.A book of unusual, complex characters in non conventional settings, the strength of this book is how it demonstrates that, no matter how different and non-conformist we may be on the surface, we are nevertheless very remarkably the same in what we want and what we fear.A lovely and oddly inspiring story."
3,strange ending,The Magician's Assitant chronicled the life of a grieving widow. The book is full of twists and turns and surprises. I was ready for another chapter when the book ended.
2,Too Many Typos = Where's the editor?,"I bought this on my Kindle App for Ipad, every page had a typo!! It had a stupid ending too. The book did not leave me wanting more - it left me saying ""goodness, that was a total waste of my time."""
3,"beautifully written, ultimately boring","i enjoyed this novel for about 2/3 of it length. the writing was wonderful and, unlike some reviewers, i could accept the living arrangement.what finally forced me to put down the book, after skipping over most of the last third to discover, yes, i had indeed predicted the outcome, was the emotional limits, superficiality and immaturity of the concept. perhaps if i had been fifteen, or even ten, years younger when reading this i would have been more impressed. i didn't expect shakespeare, but, for deeper understanding of people i can name at least three writers primarily known for their mysteries.the prose is wonderful. the plotting is good. the novel is worth at least a try."
2,Literary Magic,"The only magic wrought by Ann Patchett was the legerdemain that she used on her readers. As Sabine told her nephews, the trick is in the verbal patter and movement that keeps the audience's attention away from what is really going on in front of them, leading them to believe that something out of the ordinary is happening. This was a disappointingly undeveloped book with just enough promise to fool the reader into thinking it held greater meaning that it did. Considering all the truly good books one could spend time with, this is at best, an unsatisfying diversion."
2,Not very engaging,Total waste of timeHard to connect with charactersSkinny plotAnti climaticUnrealisticBoringLack of engagement with reader
1,The Worst Book I Read in '98,Talk about overrated novels. I bought this book in good faith after reading the rave reviews. I can't believe anyone could enjoy this novel. It is extremely boring and meanders all over the place. Someone compared this book to the works of Anne Tyler ... you'd better go back and reread Tyler! There's no comparison.
2,Read something else,This is another one of those books where everything and everyone is either black or white. LA and the three main characters are all flawless. Nebraska is a wasteland populated by ignorant brutes.Come on Ann give us a little credit. Life isn't like that.
3,a bit strange,"I have enjoyed previous Ann Patchett work but found this one just a bit too strange, in many respects. It is well written, however, and one might enjoy the unique twists found within it."
3,Had promise but didn't measure up in the end,"I was drawn in by the characters and their relationships. I think the author told the story well, but then the plot took a couple strange turns, and not necessarily what I think were for the best. The ending was abrupt and a letdown. Did the author have a deadline to meet and rushed the ending? That's what it seems like."
3,It could have been great...,"Although the basic premise of this book is a bit hard to swallow, it does capture the reader with beautiful prose. It delivers great sensitivity on several levels. The dream sequences are notable. Unfortunately, the ending is beyond disappointing. It is as if the author stopped in mid sentence. There could be two very plausible endings to this book, and the author employed neither. It's not one of those endings that really makes the reader think, it is just incomplete. What could have been a great book seemed purposely derailed at the end with what appears to be the author's running out of gas."
3,Not her best......,"I am in a Ann Patchett mode, but I am finding this book tedious... no comparison to Patron Saint of Liars or Bel Canto. Frankly, I have 25 pages to go and it's a struggle. I'm tired of cold Nebraska and Kitty, especially ... all topics have been beaten to death!"
1,Very poor finish....,I was very disappointed at this product. The finish was very poor and on top of that several pieces came chipped. Probably packing or transportation. I returned it and hoping to get my refund from the seller. :(
3,Same experience,I bought these to replace my front turn signals expecting them to be a bright white. These bulbs did shine white but a dull white at best. The stock bulbs were far superior. Keep shopping..
3,"Xtreme White, no so Bright","I purchased these hoping to get a brighter light in my tail lights, I compared them side by side and they weren't even as bright as my stock bulbs. Was a waiste of money for me"
5,"Great bulb, Could be a little whiter","On my 2001 Grand Prix GT i wanted a white bulb so i searched and found this bulb. Took me no more than 5 minutes to put in and put the light back on. Bulb worked great was really bright and it look sleek. Only thing was it was more of a blue-ish tint and could of been a little whiter, but other than that great bulb."
3,"Works well, not permanent","The product works well, I just didn't understand that its a temporary fix. The product netralizes the unwanted scent for 24 hours."
4,A little disappointed,"Overall, I love this product (tap a drop) but you may be disappointed if you order the different scents now available - They all smell the same - like the original. The only one that has a little bit of a different scent is the citrus - the others smell like the original - I haven't tried the baby powder scent, but did try the others. As to effectiveness - I would recommend it. It does a good job in eliminating odors - you may have to use more than just a drop, but it works."
2,This stuff stinks,"I bought this in hopes of removing an awful odor of vomit that was on a piece of luggage I bought recently. The plastic smell was awful to my sensative sense of smell.I tried all the other ""fixes"" and at last resort bought this. This has such a highly medicinal smell that it was almost as bad as the other smell I was trying to remove.This product is NOT good for those with very sensitive noses to smells. It does NOT neutralize the smell as it seems some reviews state. It just covers them up with another. It did not remove the smell of the luggage and I had to return the luggage."
5,"Women rock in the Papal ""No""","If you've ever wondered why women are undervalued in the Roman Catholic Church, read Deborah Halter's The Papal ""No"": A Comprehensive Guide to the Vatican's Rejection of Women's Ordination. One can only hope that this is the beginning of the end of the Roman Catholic patriarchy. What a shot in the arm of the church that would be!!! If you are a Catholic woman, don't be afraid to read the truth. It could even make you a better Catholic."
4,"good quick read, great for pre-teens","This book is out of print, but I found a copy at a local bookstore for a light read and was surprised. It reminds me of Nancy Drew mysteries. I think would be great for pre-teen readers, and it's not too dated."
2,boring,"This book was very boring and a waste of time in a methods class. It was too long, and very verbose, despite the fact that the information contained therein can be found in a lot of other places. Overall, it is an easy read but very boring."
3,You'd better be in the field...,"On plus side, I learned a lot from reading this book. At times, it's extremely interesting and delightful to read. At times it grinds like a college text book. If you don't have a great background on the subject matter---paleontology---you're going to have a struggle with terms and names. I called it ""that damn book"" because I wanted to finish it, which I did, but I can't say it was fun. It deserves 3 or better stars because it's well-researched and written---just too technical for the layperson and not that enjoyable to slog through. In other words, when called to dinner, you'll be able to put it down but you won't want to give up entirely.Chris"
2,"Tastes ok - but congeals quickly, and full of partially hydrogenated oil","This cocoa tastes ok as it is a nice blend of chocolate and coffee flavors. However, it congeals quickly (these clumps of stuff rise to the top while the cocoa cools - within 5-10 minutes). Additionally, on reading the ingredients list, one discovers that this cocoa has quite a bit of trans fat (partially hydrogenated soybean oil is the 5th ingredient). So, although I am a hot chocolate lover, and often add coffee to my hot cocoa, I would not buy this product again."
2,"Short on plot, long on lecture","Normally I love Rita Mae Brown's stories. I can't wait for them to come out! But this one I found to be disappointing. It had virtually no plot and little interesting interactions with the animals but what felt like an inordinate amount of ""lecturing"" about various and sundry things. Frankly, it was dull which is something I never thought I would say about one of Ms. Brown's books."
2,Too Many Characters!,"This novel seemed like a rush job. The characters are so prolific that you barely get to know who's who - is it human, animal or hunting history being shared. Too much to sort out and too little meat to make it worth it."
3,Slow Going,"THE HUNT BALL by Rita Mae Brown is slow going after the previous three in the series. This one has more information about the sport of fox hunting and the differences between English and American editions of the sport.A murder that is shocking when a Halloween effigy turns out to be the body of the chief fund raiser for an exclusive girls school.""Sister"" Jane Arnold, master of the Jefferson Hunt has the help of the animals that surround her, but things are fuddled by humans who have lost their understanding. A fun read, which has the deepest insights into human behavior expressed by the foxes.Nash Black, SINS OF THE FATHERS."
3,not as good,"The Hunt Ball isn't as good a read as the other three books in this series. It seems as if Ms. Brown was distracted - the book doesn't hang together and the plot isn't very believable. The writing seems shallow and superficial.A lot of the best thoughts and dialogue belong to the animals, especially the foxes.Even if this book isn't the equal of other works by the author, it wasn't a bad read, and I finished it in one day."
3,Audio edition disappointing,"Rita Mae Brown reads her own work in the audio version of this book, not a good decision. Sometimes (like with Barbara Kinsolver), the author's reading enhances a book. Unfortunately, Ms. Brown's inept reading was distracting. I think, overall, I liked the book, as I've liked all her previous works. But with her very odd pacing (she sometimes ran names together, so for the first several chapters I thought there were nuns in the book - Sister Charlotte, for example) and her inability to ""voice"" the characters differently, I kept getting lost. Several times I had no clue whether the speaker was animal or human. I'd not read any of the Hunt Club books before; maybe it would have helped if I had already known all the characters."
1,"Buy From Genbukan, Don't Get Robbed Here","These books are available from the Genbukan website for around $40. Resellers are clearly trying to exploit people that just don't know any better.This book is easily worth the $40 price tag, and contains a wealth of knowledge, but every martial arts style has secret oral teachings that can only be acquired by studying the art in an actual school."
3,A Genbukan Hanbook,"Though this review will be read long after the events that have incited me to write it, at present (the time of my writing) there is only copy of this book being offered. The seller is ""rare_esoteric_books"" and their offering Ninpo Bugei Vol. 1 for $350. I sure if the true modern Iga shinobi warrior feels the ""calling"" from ancient ancestors, s/he will find a way to fit this bill. On the other hand, for someone like me, with a grip on reality and limited funds, this is mildly outrageous.[...]"
3,Funny and Entertaining,"Call me corny, but I liked this one. Typical of SB's male characters, the lead male is very sure of himself, strong, forward, and rather aggressive. Qualities I happen to like in a man, but see very little of in real life. The plot is rather simple, but enjoyable none the less. I wouldn't skip this one. I thought is was funny and entertaining (as I said in the title). I say read it."
2,CERTAINLY NOT HER BEST....,"OK, MAYBE JUST READING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN LISTENING TO IT ON TAPE. THE READER WAS SIMPLY AWFUL. SANDRA BROWNS BOOKS ARE BETTER THAN THIS AUDIO VERSION. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON IT!"
3,"Typical, but fun","I think there's yet to be a Sandra Brown book I haven't liked. Her non-suspense romances even manage to be complex and sexy without being sickly sweet or cliché. Sunny may have over-reacted a bit to her wedding that didn't happen, but I understand small towns and how news, accurate or not, travels fast. Ty was straight-forward and pushy, but seemed to know exactly what she needed, right from the start. Brown is one of the best at creating sexual tension, and that's what really sells a romance for me."
3,Smooth operator,"Sandra Brown's latest reissue from her Loveswept Romance Sunny Chandler is clearly outdated in its theme. The haughty alpha male and town sheriff of Latham Green Ty Beaumont finds himself intrigued by the return of scandalized Sunny Chandler. The scorching beauty is rumoured to have jumped out of a marriage. As the story unfolds, the flawed characters are spurned by love - and are drawn towards each other. Feminists may sneer at Ty's manhandling but maestro Sandra Brown peppers the unbelieveable tale with heated dialogues and fast wits. It is clearly not Ms. Brown's best but as usual she is a smooth operator at testing the limits of credibility."
1,PUKE!!!,"This book was ridiculous! How are we to believe this woman is the strong herione when she is as wishy-washy as a limp rag!! She fell in love with the biggest chauvinist in town and in less than a week and hated him the whole time. However, I can see why she hated him, he exibited no likable traits. I would NEVER recommend this book--except on a dare."
1,This is romance?,"Sonny and Ty meet at a wedding where he makes a bet with a friend that he can have sex with her. Then he obnoxiously pursues her with completely inappropriate sexual innuendo -- peppered with more explicit sexual repartee.Was there really a time that a man's unwanted crude, intrusive and chauvinistic comments were considered sexually alluring? A different author would have taken this plot beginning and turned it into a stalker novel rather than a romance.And the supposedly strong and independent heroine keeps allowing the hero/stalker to persist in his way-too-personal-over-the-line-into-creepy innuendos. Is she really unable to shut him down and send him away? This is a book that promotes ""Her lips said no but her eyes said YES!"" Don't let your daughters read this one -- or your sons.I didn't finish it. I assume that they wind up together and blissfully happy. In the real world, his behavior would portend an abusive relationship, at best."
4,I want to know more about character's future together !,I enjoyed the story line and as usual Sandra brought it home !!! Her female characters are strong and sassy!
4,I LOVE THIS GUY!,"Hot pursuit by the sheriff who won't give up, keeps the lady on her toes. I love this book! A romance from several years ago, this is a fun read that you can't put down. Sandra Brown knows how to write a romance!"
3,Sunny Chandlers Return,"I read this I don't how many years ago. Is by Sandra Brown and after reading White Hot by her I kept going the library and reading everything she wrote and then published. I even read a couple her books under the name JD Rob I think. I'm gonna read this again and get back you on this one. I pretty much recommend anything this woman writes. She is phenomenal in my book/ha,ha. She really lets you get a feel for the who the people are like nobody else can. And always keeps you guessing and sucks you right into her books. That said, she developed that talent over time. Vicky Garfield/Ft.Lauderdale,FL"
2,Sunny Chandler's Return,"I expected more of a mistery story. I found I was forcing myself to get through the book.Frankly, I got a bit bored. Itwasn't what I expect from a Sandra Brown book."
1,What a Huge Disappointment!,"I have been reading Sandra Brown for years. Her books usually have intrigue and a plot. This book had neither. If I wanted to read a victorian romance novel with a transparent plot, I sure wouldn't have paid this much for it. I would have have purchased a cheap romance novel which is all this really was. It's a shame when a good author starts trading on her name and publishing slop like this. At this point I am reluctant to purchase any more of her books."
2,'Hero' was cheesy and totally not sexy,"I honestly don't know a single woman that would have found his obnoxious and grossly inappropriate behavior sexy. He was a sheriff and should have known better, frankly he gave me the willies. The heroine was not realistic, no woman I know would have reacted to those situations the way she did. She should have threatened to press charges on the stalking hero. Also I found very little humor in this book. Not funny, not interesting and not realistic. I like my males Alpha but not machismo. Not to mention that making bets like he did is immature and frankly insulting."
1,Not a book for modern women!!,"I was very disappointed with this book.... it should have been set in the 1800's, with a wimpering maiden. I could barely force myself through it. Just because a man looks good does not mean a succesful woman will just faint at his touch."
2,Boring and Predictable,"I have read many of Sandra Brown's novels, and recently read SUNNY CHANDLER'S RETURN's reissue when it came to my library. I have to say that I was really disappointed by this book. There was no real plot, no memorable characters, or even good dialogue. This is by far Sandra Brown's worst book.*** If you have at least an ounce of feminism in your bones, DO NOT read this book."
4,Sunny Chandler Returns!!!,"I enjoyed this book. It was full of surprises, and unlikeany romances I've read before.Sunny returns to town after a three year absence. She had left town because of some terrible rumors. When she returnspeople still have bad thoughts of her, and one man goes so far as to make a bet concerning her. The question is where will thatbet lead to.As I said, I enjoyed this book, and would recommend itto not only every Sandra Brown fan, but to every fan of romance:)"
3,A One-Nighter...,"Several have done a nice job of summarizing the plot of this book, so I'll skip that task and just say that I found this book to be a quick, nice read. It's a typical Sandra Brown with romance and a few twists to keep you guessing about what happened in the past to the main characters, Sunny and Ty, to bring them to where they are today. I found it to be one of Brown's better works that I've read lately. There was some humor tossed in the mix...a fun, unexpected treat!I do recommend that you read this book if you're a fan of Sandra Brown or simply romances that involve a bit of a cat-and-mouse adventure and mystery on the way to a romantic ending. I recommend that you borrow this one from a library or friend or purchase it used. I liked it, but I can't say it's worth paying full price for."
4,"Very Enjoyable, for what it was........","I read this book in one day which is why I enjoyed it. It was a quick read with a simple plot and a gripping-enough love story.I was glad Brown didn't make us wait until the end of the novel to find out what Sunny's secret was (Brown has a habit of doing that). This book had enough momentum to keep me turning pages, and both characters were very likeable. They meshed well.I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a quick romance novel on the beach, on vacation, or before you go to bed."
3,Vintage Sandra Brown,"A good story considering when it was written -- what mid-80s? I can't imagine that Sandra Brown would write it this way now, nearly 20 years later, but it's a good story. It doesn't seem particularly real, but it is typical Sandra Brown: well written, interesting, and worth your time if you aren't going to get all bent out of shape because it doesn't come across as current. Well, I guess there could be someone out there who would bet he could get the girl in bed within so many days, but I can't imagine someone leaving home and refusing to come back for 3 years for such a flimsy reason as we have here. Read the story with a grain of salt and enjoy it."
5,Sunny Chandler's Return,"My favorite feel good romance escape book. Maturity, self esteem, and determination. Ty Beaumont breaks down Sunny's independent wall and now she doesn't have to live strong and lonely anymore. With Ty she is strong and finally in love."
3,pleasant,"I am not a romance reader. I have read a few and they all follow the same formula. I picked this up because I was bored on a trip. I listened to an unabridged version read by Beth MacDonald who was very good.This story is not bad. Spurned bride flees town to return 3 years later and meets the town sheriff Ty Beaumont - a hunky, allbeit male chauvanistic type male. I like him! (oh no!)Anyway ... I could have done without the constant touch here , grab there and have more sizzling interative chemistry (which takes skill to write and create!) but all in all I actually enjoyed this book. I would even read another by Sandra Brown sometime.... maybe."
3,Guanaja before Mitch.,"I purchased this book because I travel often to the island of Guanaja. I don't know if it would be interesting to me otherwise. Remembering Guanaja before the effects of Hurricane Mitch and the rebuilding and addition of some technology that came afterward is sweet. Although each chapter has some interesting points, it was frustrating that Ms. Collins felt she must mask the names of actual places on the island, i.e. the ""beach resort"" and ""retreat resort"".She has a perspective on the dynamics of the islanders and the towns they live in that only someone who actually lived there could have. I would have liked to know more about how she came to marry an islander. It's interesting that she aparently has not returned."
1,don't buy this,I bought this attempting to find a tool to zip my dresses (from the back). The hook is too large for zippers used today and most of them do not have the hole for the hook anyway. Do not know if it's good for handicapped consumers though.
4,OMG!!,"OMG!! This is the most beautiful trumpet i've ever seen, and I've seen the trumpets. Have not played it yet; obvious as i haven't ordered one. Looks to play good; reviewed by me and other players on Lauren site. Rock on, all trumpeters."
3,Denim throw pillow,"It's a nice little throw pillow that matched the shams and comforter that I bought, but it isn't really filled to capacity. It's a ""lightly"" filled pillow, but looks fine on a bed."
3,Not up to past Putnam efforts,"This is one of the later Putnam efforts in the larger format.Whether its because of the different format, a reduction in 3-view drawings, or simply the writing, I didn't like this book as much as the 20+ other Putnam aviation books in my library. It lacks the detail and (dare I say) ""charm"" of the early books written by true marque experts, who could make the history of esoteric UK firms (a specialty of the early Putnam books) interesting.That's not to say the book has no value, it presents the basic facts of all the various production models but without any background or context. It comes across more like one of the souless ""aviation encylopedias"" filled with lots of numbers, than a well-researched history of a noteworthy firm.Let's hope they return to the old format."
3,Love Uncertainty,There are very few things in life which are not touched by a precise understand of science. Yet there is chaos and uncertainty that goes along with the world's great engineering feats and or understand the mechanics of how the world works. This book puts it all into the proper perspective. Read it and you'll understand how to attain mastery over nature and our resources while at the same time allowing for the wiggle room that uncertain variables produce.
2,Earnest and worthy,"While no doubt earnest and worthy, the book is so dull that the reader even looks forward to the author riding his hobby horse of global warming. There, at least, the author demonstrates some passion such as calling anyone who disagrees with him a lackey of the oil companies."
1,Not good movie,"I like the First movie, Shootfighters better than Second movie. It is not really interesting."
2,"Nice Story, but not well written and kind of a let down","I bought this book to gain some anecdotal insights into Katrina for a presentation I had to give. Needless to say it was nearly worthless for that purpose. If you are interested in a book with great anecdotal stories and full of historical facts, go with ""The Great Deluge"" by historian Douglas Brinkley.To be fair, the storyline was pleasant. However, it was shallow and poorly written. A very easy read but also boring."
1,A Book for Potential Teachers Should Not Be Error-Filled,"Pending my decision to change careers from the law to teaching in NY State, I purchased both this book, and it's competitor book from Barron's. I found this volume HORRIBLE, in that it is filled with INCORRECT ANSWERS, TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS, and looks like a hasty compendium by a husband-and-wife team to put together a review book for Teacher Certification Candidates rapidly. Very disappointing, and AWFUL for those with less experience at spotting these discrepancies. USE THE BARRON'S ONLY!!![B.A., J.D. and Ph.D.]"
3,I read it and it's for real...,"This book is a little ""dry"" at first, quoting a lot of facts and figures. which the novice may find intimidating. However, if you look closely, you can find the real reasons that an entire industry is in a ""race to the bottom of the economic scale"". Mr. Belzer points out quite accurately how a formerly middle class occupation has been destroyed. He also makes the point that de-regulation may not be the ""cure-all"" that everyone envisions. Is a few cents off that box of ""Wheaties"" worth destroying hundreds of thousands of formerly good paying jobs ? As a long time driver I found the book to be truthful and accurate."
3,old movies,"Interesting to see moves from the late 50's and early 60's; however, only one of the movies in this package was worth watching."
1,Cheap Copy,You're better off paying more for good individual dvds. Them! wouldn't play at all. Them and Beast were the reasons for my purchase. They are great classic 50's sci-fi. I would have been better off paying a little more to buy those 2 dvds than getting this cheap package. Beware.
1,Simple Yarn,All Four Pictures are simple yarn. They can be seen inTCM or other cable network. Maybe the best picture isTHEM. Otherwise the rest are not so impressive.
2,TCM Greatest Classsic SCI-Fi Films Collection,"DVD was missing Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. That movie was missing from the DVD, the other three movies worked fine."
3,Matt Dillon in a sci/fi movie?,Actually James Arness & his brother Peter Graves (mission impossible)did make sci/fi movies. Arness and James Whitmore makes Them really worth watching. The other 3 movies judge for yourself. I would say 2and 1/2 stars.
4,Old Classics,Arrived on time and all four DVD's played well. I enjoyed watching all of them as I haven't seen them in a long time.
4,TCM Greatest Classic Films Collection: Sci-Fi,"These are re-done and better than the released single DVD's. ""World Without End"" is the widescreen version. If you are a 50's Sci-Fi fan this is worthy of adding to your collection."
5,Three out of four favorite sci-fi movies!,"I already have a copy of THEM but, I have been trying to find WORLD WITHOUT END and THE BEAST FROM 20,000 Fathoms for a long time. The picture is extremely good for a DVD. Who knows how much better 'they' will IF 'they' come out on Blu-Ray Discs? Pure enjoyment and terror! A must have for classic well acted entertainment..."
4,Sci- Fi oldies,"Will always remember the sound's of Them. Still love this old movie. No blood, gore, or foul language like todays Sci-Fi flicks. Great if you like the old ones."
3,Mixed bag,"""Them"" is a classic. Very well done and great special effects and top-notch cast. ""Beast..."" is good on the special effects but really didn't follow the Bradbury story which was quite good. Best thing about it was the Extras which included an interview with those two old pros Bradbury and Harryhousen. The other two films were only fair.--DJS"
3,"Pasmore's Perspective, not his art.","Interesting for its insight into Pasmore's attitudes towards art, this book contains only one piece by Pasmore, so skip it if you are interested in a catalog of his works."
2,Good Concept - Bad code,"I just brought this book, thinking I can use it to help me get back up to speed in the time allocted - NOT! I have been spending more time trying to get the code examples to work. An example is the simple word processor in the opening chapters. I carefully followed his code (with different object names from one chapter to the next) and the example never properly updated the textbox properties. An updated list of corrected code and text errors should be posted by hungry minds - wiley immediately. Great learning concept with very bad or nonexistant editing. This was written with the beta version and I am using the retail release (this DOES make a differance)."
2,Can't decide who his reader is,"My gripe with the book is he can't decide who his reader is. Quite a bit of the time he is writing to the VB programmer moving up to VB.Net. Other times he is writing to the very beginner, going over very basic programming concepts anyone who has done any programming would know (what is a variable?). And at other times, he assumes you know concepts of VB, that the programmer who has never used VB is not familiar with. And he doesn't get into object oriented programming concepts until the last Chapter, and not much then."
1,Example code does not work,"Many examples do not run propertly. Most will compile, but have runtime errors that prevent the program from working. Really if you are going to learn to code, you need code that works.Look elsewhere for a beginners course."
1,Egregious Errors,"I agree with the earlier reviewer that having a stepped course is a good way into a programming language but the egregious coding errors in the examples were bad. I went through this with my son who is a learner, and he found it difficult to believe that the coding errors were not his.The text parts of the book were also sprinkled with inconsistencies and bizarre jumps. A lot of the commentary is pretentious and patronizing. It would appear that the book did not have an editor at all."
2,Skips around too much,"While the book is at a level I can understand, the author spends too much time saying ""Click on this, but we won't cover it in depth until Chapter XX"". It's very confusing skipping around like this and in some cases he says try some code in one chapter that will still be in your project later on when he asks you to try something else, but doesn't mention how to deal with the code you tried 3 chapters ago...Delete it or add on..if add on how do you do it?I'm only in Session 4 but getting ready to give up and try another book."
1,Sample code doesn't work,"Claims to teach you VB.NET in just 15 hours. In session 6 of 30, the book give you sample code that doesn't work. I spent hours reviewing for _my_ mistake and hours more reviewing web sites and newsgroups. Found the example given simply will not work, and if it did would be very poor programming practice.Also, in order to compress all of VB concepts into a small time, the book intersperses topics into completely unrelated sections. It made reviewing and debugging very dificult. After session 6 exasperations, I bought a new book."
3,Not a high quality product,The bottom of the actual table surface is covered with one piece of paper that easily peels off at the corners of the table. I expected more from a quality lab table. This item is overpriced.
1,Misleading packaging -- a big bait and switch,"Don't buy or rent this video with the expectation that you will learn anything about the music and life of one of the greatest 19th century composers. Instead, this program offers an interpretive dance routine set to Chopin's music and George Sands' writings. A complete snoozefest."
2,"Informative, BUT",This book has very detailed information on ALL sorts of parasites. It really made me aware of how many are around and IN me!BUT it really leaves no remedy to rid yourself of these nasty things except to buy the line of supplements sold by the author's company. And they are expensive!I was dissapointed that there were no other supplement reccomendations.It left me hanging.
5,Books,One of the more interesting books I have read regarding internal parasites. Makes you stop and think. I think everyone should read this in grammar school and then again later in life.
3,book about parasites,Haven't read book yet. I'm sure it's informative. Was delivered in good condition and promptly.
5,My lost book restored!,"I was given a hard blund copy of this book when I was 24, 60 years ago, and treasued it. I was devastated when it was lost in the last move. This soft bound copy is a great replacement."
2,What Seemed to be Impossible... Was!,"Billington's unrivaled scholarship in the field of Russian history cannot redeem the overwhelming failures of this video documentary project. The Face of Russia attempts to present a survey of Russian culture - including painting; literature (fiction and poetry); film; music; architecture (both traditional styles as well as those imported from abroad); a little dance and theatre as well -- in three hours. Within 15 minutes, it becomes obvious that Billington must have resigned himself to narrating what amounts to a highly personal, somewhat idiosyncratic retrospective of those works of Russian culture that have stood out to him as particularly significant. There's not time to explain why, though. It comes across as subjective, formless, and vaguely irresponsible. Go to Russia for real, or read some of Billington's excellent books on the topic. Skip these videos."
1,steven seagal with a mexican accent,the title... that's as far as I went before I turned it off after the first 5 minutes. Seagal jumping into the scene with a broken mexican accent and I yelled CUT! movie night selection fail.. moved onto the next.
5,"My daughter wants ""Taxi"" every time we get in the car!","""Taxi"" is great. The songs are so much fun and easy for my 2 year old to sing along with. Plus, it's bearable for mom and dad... OK, we're singing too!"
5,Dir en Grey is awesome!,"This single is probably a good starter for people who like heavier music, which Dir en Grey has. If not listen to a softer single, like Ain't Afraid to Die, which Dir en Grey also mastered. Dir en Grey has music that everyone will like. They do every gengre of rock and are able to think outside the box. People who think that only certain songs of their are good are sadly mistaken. Sometimes the songs sound a little strange, but if you think about what they're saying and how they're protraying their message then you will truly realize that Dir en Grey is a great band and all of their songs are masterpieces, just as this one is. (and for those who don't know, this song is in English... THE ENTIRE SONG IS)"
3,School Bongos,"Just opened the box and I am just hoping that these are durable. The head of them seem to be made of some sort of paper. They are a Christmas present for my son so if they tear, I will have to return them and that does not make me happy. Hoping they work out and are stronger than they appear. Crossing my fingers!Merry Christmas!"
2,Needs some work,"Using this manual, I have r&r'd clutch, axles, timing chain, valvetrain, door hinges, oil pan gasket, chain tensioner, oil sending unit, water pump and many other maintenance repairs. Although the manual was useful, it was very clumsy to get around. You cannot reference a single repair without skipping around to 3 or more different chapters. Necessary details were often omitted, and special tools which are required to do the job are not listed. All though the manual was of assistance, I much preferred the Nissan Mfg. service manual."
4,Silverstone 80 mm Case Fan FN81 (Black),"Silverstone makes some long lasting fans and,most of the time Amazon has the best prices on them.This one wasn't quite powerful enough for my intake but great as an exhaust.Very quiet."
3,Loud at stock voltage,I was forced to use 80mm case fans in my HTPC case. I ordered a total of 2. They were very loud for HTPC standards. Got a zalman fan mate 2 to control the voltage. They are quiet at 1/2 the voltage.I would suggest someone look for PWM case fans for 80mm size. They are loud at stock voltage.
1,A Heads UP,I just thought I would alert people that the fleur de lis is upside down! I bet it is hard to sell that way. I am not buying and I have always wanted a necklace or earrings with my University's symbol. I bought earrings.
4,Good,"I recieved my CD yesterday, I had never heard anything by the artist before and I bought it off a whim. It is an amusing listen, Laurell has a pretty voice and the songs sound like they come from the early 90's pop/rock with a soft floaty tone. <<looking>> It was copyrighted in '86, which I usually wouldn't think about as a way to judge new age artist... but this just really fits the genre in a not to serious way. The songs are cute, floaty, and easy to listen to, even at times to really smile on the inside. There was some really deep catchyness with a few of the songs. Where I felt the album was limited was that of the six tracs (so the album is short as they are regular sized songs)(one is hidden and I haven't been able to listen to it on my walkman) two of them weren't remarkable for me, though the other three were very enjoyable. I don't think that this cd will be among the ones that will get much use in my collection, even though I would probably share one or two songs with others."
5,Precious Gem In The Tabernacle,"What an incredible Truth displayed and revealed for modern man to understand how necessary it is to study the Old Testament Tabernacle that is so clearly brought out in this book,revealing the Stature of Jesus Christ. Every small detail having a spiritual definition and how it relates to mankind in their journey in the growing process, of growing unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ. This book is exciting! What a tremendous privilege to own this book. It is not a curl up on the end of the sofa read, it inspires you to get your Bible, notepad, pencil and start your journey of learning! It is an amazing revelation of the Stature of Christ. I highly recommend this book."
5,Mosaic Tabernacle Explained,"In the past I would skip reading many of the chapters of Exodus because I was unable to comprehend their purpose of being included in the Bible. After reading this book, I now have a clearer understanding of why God instructed Moses to build the Tabernacle in the Wilderness. The author, with her extensive knowledge of Rabbinical Hebrew, expertly explains how the Book of Exodus relates to the New Testament and to our Saviour, Jesus Christ."
5,Good match,I have a 1989 Oldsmobile Alero and the Ford green touchup paint is a close match ......good enough for rock chips.
5,this is great book to own!,"This is a great book to own.It covers everyhting you had questions about from health,food,vitamins."
4,Jolly good book!,"Extremely informative and attractively laid out. Excellent for those who don't have the slightest clue how to put together a healthy diet (like me, once upon a time). Lots of interesting recipes as well. The only drawback is that the author is British and originally aimed this book at the UK market, so you'd better brush up on your metric skills for the recipes! Also, I've never understood the English love for beans on toast, although I've tried it and it's not half bad. If you're just starting to read about nutrition, this book is an excellent place to start."
5,Best Wedding Album... A satisfied coustmer,after hearing Daughter of Mine by John McDermott on a local raido station I knew that was the song I wanted to dance with my father. I search all over the internet to find that song and came across this album... I took a chance in purchasing it and I love it. It has every type of wedding ballads and all different song types/styles. Infact a song I never heard of was on this album and I selected it to dance with my beloved and our first dance song. Buy this album.... you wont regret it.
2,90% obvious to a half-decent programmer,"While I liked Volume 1 of this series, this book is just not worth the money. Most of its ""patterns"" are obvious strategies which anyone who has taken more than a couple CS classes will know already. For example, there are about ten ""User Interface"" patterns. These consist of things like ""If the user needs to enter many pieces of discrete information, use the Form pattern."" Many of the other patterns are similarly obvious.However, there were a few ideas about efficiency and testing which I found useful, so the book is not a total loss. I'd suggest flipping through it at a local bookstore, but that's it."
1,A book of extraordinarily low value,"Around three years ago, I joked with a collegue of mine that a sure way to make a fortune would be to write a book which included the words ""Java"" and ""Patterns"" in the title. It would matter little, I argued, what the book contained. Just the title and a half-decent graphic on the front page would suffice.It seems to me that both Mr Grand and his publishers Wiley are attempting to cash in on this very idea. The problem is that the joke was a bad one in the first place, and that it is now being made far too late in the day.I hope that the software development community is sufficiently aware that it won't be taken in by this outrage."
1,Trash,"This book epitomises so much of what is wrong in the software industry that I wonder if, in a sick kind of ironic way, that this is its only value?It cashes in on buzzwords in the title but is full of errors and demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the material by the author.There is nothing to redeem this book. It is an embarassment."
2,"Fluff, Fluff, Fluff....","In my opinion, code examples are just as important as the text that explains it. Unfortunately, the author didn't think so. Going through the book and visiting the companion website to get the source code to run was a waste of time.For the most part, the code didn't work at all! It didn't matter what compiler version you make use of; I used 4 different versions of the JDK. A book is supposed to save you time when you are trying to learn. This book doesn't fit the bill. I still had to go to the web in order to get working examples of the patterns mentioned in the book.I'm sure the author know's what he talking about. I just think that he should prove it by writing programs that are tested and that compile before shipping it off in a book."
1,Not Recommended - Summary of Elementary Programming Concepts,"I will be returning this book tomorrow. If I compare my expectations (ie. a ""design patterns"" book) with what the book contains, it is one of the worst books I've ever seen. Things like ""grey out not available menu items"" and ""use switch statements instead of nested if/elseif"" are simply good programming techniques that we all learn; they are not what we come to know as ""patterns"". It isn't so bad to have a book like this, but it should not be called a patterns book, because this is highly misleading. One who buys a patterns book isn't expecting this kind of elementary information. To be fair to the author, it is the type of material that makes it not acceptable, not how it is written. It presents good programming standards and guidelines, but a 20 page book could accomplish that with simple examples, without repetitive and unnecessary information. If you want a patterns book, don't even consider this."
2,Design pattern II,"Just like movies. The first book was a hit but the sequel was dissapointing. I would prefer wait for one more year and get something worthy buying. Very dissapointed. I was expecting either more patterns, more application using pattern on first book, or just digging deeper into patterns previously discussed. Too bad. I will not be waiting for volume III."
1,Maybe an OK book for VERY beginners to programming in Java,"Despite volume One's syntactical and logical errors as pointed out by some of the reviewers, I actually liked volume 1. This sequel was so disappointing to me that I returned it as soon as I could.If you're looking for more *design* patterns, then this is NOT the book for you. If you feel that a ""Dialog"" is a pattern (that's right, any plain-old dialog) or if you've never used a Java interface as a holder for constants, then give this book a try; otherwise don't bother.I actually didn't find a single pattern that was interesting to me. It was either stating the obvious or completely useless. There was a whole section of ""Testing"" patterns at the end of the book which I didn't even bother to look at.I really don't understand the author. Did he run out of *useful* patterns to document.The only folks that might benefit from this book are extreme beginners to Java and programming in general. For the rest of us, there are other patterns books."
3,Not the updated version,Was disappointed and had to give it away to a friend. Was expecting the latest version which I saw a copy from the library. Had to buy the latest version from a nearby Joann Fabrics store.
5,Outstanding,"Very clear, beautiful photos make every step easy to understand. Instructions are complete and every step is illustrated. This is a great reference book for the basics and beyond.I pull this book out and use it instead of pattern instructions for setting in sleeves, creating buttonholes, and making waistbands.There's a nice section at the back for home dec projects, though the focus for most of the book is on clothing. A great buy."
3,just okay,"my husband gave me this book for my birthday since i started sewing as a hobby. at first, i thought this book was great - lots of pictures of sewing techniques, and it even outlines how to sew other accessories like drapes and pillows. but as i started sewing just a bit more, i realized how lacking this book is in the details that make the results look professional, not homemade. this book completely skips bound buttonholes, and only refers to machine made buttonholes - which i already knew about from the sewing machine manual. the book talks about fusible interfacing, but doesn't explain that moving the iron when apply interfacing results in bubbles in the finished garment. these are all details that i found out from the reader's digest complete guide to sewing (1997 or earlier edition), which is my go-to reference when i have a sewing question. on the plus side, this book does have a lot of pictures."
4,Glad to Add it to My Library,"I'm a self-taught/mom-taught sewist. The problem is that what I learned from Mom (no offense Mom) was one-off information about what I was sewing at the time.Thanks to the Internet you can find all this information online but often only when you already know what you are looking for. This is what I'd expect to be required reading for a sewing class where you read the basics then do it in class on a project designed to accommodate the techniques you've learned.The first night I got it and flipped through to find lots of new information I didn't know, some things I knew already and a handful of stuff I'll probably never need. I'm still quite glad to have this to reference when trying to wing a project an needing some technical advice! The photos feel very dated but the techniques have stood the test of time so there's no real complaining to do there!Note: The book does not lay flat easily. Wish it did."
4,Nice book for beginners,This is a nice book for beginners definitely. I am a book fiend and I also craft and I like to have good reference books handy. This isn't really any better than the Readers Digest Sewing book from the 70's. It's got nice color pictures but isn't THAT informative. It's just a nice book to have around for reference.
5,well pleased,"Great condition (like new), fast delivery, overall was well pleased and would do business again."
5,Great visual reference,I have a lot of sewing books but I got this as a visual reference for times when I don't want to read. I am a visual person and it's a lot faster for me to skim through the pictures than to read the instructions.
3,"Worth owning, but could be better.","I'm a beginning sewer (*very* beginning) and I purchased this book to help me with all the things patterns don't explain. Some sections have been extremely helpful (zippers, hems) and some are disappointing (sleeves, collars.) In general, the big problem is that a technique that needs 5-10 pictures (including the finished product!) has only 2-3 photos of critical steps. Those are useful, but I often find myself struggling to imagine what they're trying to accomplish. I'm not aware of a better illustrated guide, so I'm still glad I purchased this book. As far as I can tell sewing is a lot like writing code -- you just have to screw it up by yourself in order to learn much. Maybe if I ever master one of the trickier things in the book, I'll videotape it and put the video on the web. ;-)"
3,Not for Beginners,"I bought this book with the idea that I could actually learn to sew by reading it. Not so. The book is a fine reference book with great pictures, but it is not for those of us whose greatest sewing accomplishments to date is figuring out how to turn the sewing machine on."
3,Not appropriate for beginners...,"I've played around with sewing projects in the past but never been taught proper sewing techniques. I know how to use a machine and I know how to sew a straight line, but not how to do a pleat or dart. I was hoping to find a book which would provide instructions on the basics of sewing as well as more intermediate techniques. This seemed to focus more on the intermediate.The instructions seemed to be missing detail to me. For instance, one how-to instructs you to perform a staystitch, but I don't know what that is and it isn't covered in the book. The book does have a handy section on stitches, but it's for a serger machine. There were certainly some good hints in the book (and hopefully I'll be better equipped to use it one day), but if you are a beginner, I wouldn't recommend this book."
3,"A good, light read with few surprises","""A Question of Consent"" is a good book. I read it in one day because it was able to hold my attention. The plot is a good one, but the ending is obvious by the first third of the book. It's worth the money, and I will be looking for other books by this author, but don't expect John Grisham."
4,There's only one master,"I had the great privilege of seeing Maynard Ferguson perform live in Kingsport, Tennessee. He is just as amazing as before, even though he was clearly suffering from some sort of chronic disease (either emphysema or CHF).What irony. Climbing five steps to the stage clearly winded him; he was puffing like an old locomotive. But, once onstage and after catching his breath, he was as good as ever - maybe better.High-register trumpet playing may not be as often-heard as before, but it's an art that will not be lost. Enjoy!"
1,WARNING - item pictured is NOT what you will get!,"If you are wanting to order Permatex 25224 as is pictured, you will be sorely disappointed when it arrives. What will arrive is indeed what is listed in the title, Permatex 29208, which, if one goes to the Permatex website to cross-check stock data, is for a short caulking gun tube. But it's not the customer's fault that amazon.com failed to illustrate the correct item; very few people other than parts professionals go by stock numbers. So be warned. Permatex 25224 is also available on amazon.com; search for it, and confirm both the photo AND stock number."
5,Breakthrough for Vegans,"When this book first appeared over ten years ago, it was easily the best vegan cookbook available, and it still stands as one of the greatest vegan cookbooks around. Since it is now indisputable that animal products create high blood pressure and heart disease, this book offers a path off animals that still provides iron chef quality menu options. Most people with high blood pressure and related health issues, can completely heal themselves in two or three months of vegan eating."
4,Emphasis on oil,"A hundred different painters explain how they tackled in their paintings one of the most difficult, elusive and rewarding subjects: people. Each painting gets a page long explanation, focused in one of the techniques employed or in some creativity issue relevant to the subject matter. The fact that most artists list the colors they used is definitely a plus. My only qualm with this book are that, being watercolor my medium of choice, I found this books places a lot of attention in oil (and if you're a pastelist or use some other technique, you're in an even worse position). Another minor flaw is the fact that the beautiful picture on the cover is not of those analyzed inside. However, I am being nitpicky, as this book is beatiful and inspiring, and will help anyone seeking to expand his or her creative horizons-"
5,Terrific Books,The selection of artists in this book is excellent. I am actually one of the artists featured in their other book: How did you paint that? 100 ways to paint your favorite subjects.My specialty is clown and circus subject matter. Please view my work at my site: www.clownartist.com.
3,-Six Ugly-,"Not a bad album. But, it's definitley not up to par. It seems that Deg went for a different approach here (as they always like to do). The first four tracks are pretty strong, but 'Children' and 'byo [] shin' aren't very appealing.I'd suggest checking out other Dir en grey albums before listening to this."
4,Hunger review,"I was really happy with my purchase. It was affordable, in good condition and brought to me in a timely manner."
3,A good start,"There is no doubt that Chang is a much better writer than Amy Tan in terms of language and plot. I think the title novella is wonderfully crafted, and full of fresh images and surprises. However, the other stories reduce the book's overall power by recycling the same themes (like Amy Tan's books subsequent to JLC) of Hunger. If only Chang could have the inventiveness of Ha Jin, she would be a major talent."
4,Hungered for More,"Chang's writing is comfortable and easy, like sitting down with a relative for a long chat. In this case, a long chat about what it was like to grow up in New York as an immigrant--the unsuccessful struggle of Min's husband Tian to fight against unspoken racism to become more than a waiter, the struggle for Min to want her daughters to succeed in this English-speaking world without losing her own ability to understand them, the struggle of finding a way to call anyplace ""home."" I savored every page....until I got to the last third of the book. It took me several chapters to realize that the novella had already ended and I was now in the head of a different immigrant (five short stories are tacked onto the end of the novella.) A bit disconcerting, especially as I hated to leave Min's story behind."
1,NOT A CHARGER,"This item DOES NOT charge your camera. It does provide power to your camera WHILE PLUGGED IN, but it does not recharge your camera's battery."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,This does not charge the battery at all. The camera won't even come on when not hooked up to this adapter. It will work while plugged in but who wants to stand at the outlet to take pictures???
1,"Low Quality, Unstable","This product is made from cheap material. It's very unstable, you can NOT hang anything on it or it'll lean forward. I'll return it."
3,Relaxing. Working slowly,"Per my BF, who I bought it for. Says it relaxes him. He listens to it everytime he wants to have a smoke. Normally smokes whole pack per day. The day he listenend to this, he only had 3 the whole day. It works when you listen to it, but slowly and he has to keep listening to it. But finds it very relaxing and he finds it good for anxiety"
2,Book is off by a bit.,"This book is strictly for the most avid baseball fan. It highlights the careers of all-star caliber players that just missed the MLB Hall of Fame by introducing their stats and some good anecdotes. Not enough photos especially for the old-time players that someone from this generation would need to have in order to connect with. Some of those interviewed are repeated for multiple players thereby diluting the strength of the accolades they attribute to those 'Out by a Step.' It feels like the Shalins had a fun time writing this book, but that enthusiasm doesn't translate nearly enough for many of the unfamiliar players."
4,A charming love story,"I had a hard time getting into Garwood's first novella of the Clayborne Brides, and actually didn't read it until after devouring this and the third novella. This was a great story - one that could have been turned into a full-length novel. It's a great diversion for a short plane ride or bus trip. Of course, it's not as fulfilling as her full-length novels, but what do you expect? It's short. Pick this one up - I'd say it was the best of the three novellas."
2,TOO SHORT!,THE BOOK IS TOO SHORT TO GET INTO A STORY. NOT ENOUGH TIME FOR ROMANCE. MS. GARWOOD IS MY FAVORITE ROMANCE AUTHOR BUT THIS BOOK JUST FALLS SHORT!
2,Okay not the best,"I have always been a big fan with Julie Garwoods book, but I was disapointed with this one.This was an okay book, did like the way Douglas respected Isabeal, he cared for her and treated the baby like it was his own and that was good. But at the end it was bad because the man is suppose to go after the girl."
3,"One White, one pink and one red rose!","I thoroughly enjoyed For The Roses- and went straight to the library to find these 3 smaller books. Their length did not bother me. But they did seem a little shallow. Out of the 3, One White Rose is the best to me. I did enjoy the story and would recommend others read it. The other 2 were silly and too unrealistic to me (especially One Red Rose)."
3,well..not as good as the others,"well,it's ok..but not as i expected it could be.. it's quite unexpected..the stories are not like the other books Julie Garwood use to write.."
4,Where's Cole???,"This book is good but I want to see Cole married off to someone....after that wicked girl Elenore in For the Roses, i wouuld like to see him lose his heart to someone...less fussy. :)"
4,"Onyx, a classic...",I have always liked Onyx and when I opened up the package for this ring I was amazed at how well it was made. The stone is large but quite nice. It lends itself well with so many outfits and other jewelery. I wear this ring at least once a week and have gotten a lot of compliments on it. It's also well made. You don't always need bling. Onyx is a classic.
1,Terrible Quality,"After looking at this ring online, this seemed to be a decent quality piece for a good price. In this case you get what you pay for, upon receipt I was very disappointed to find that the silver was miscolored and spotted. I attempted to use a polishing cloth, but this was of no help.I would warn anyone that you get what you pay for with this ring, very cheap feeling and looking. You would be better off getting a ring out of a gumball machine. Luckily Amazon has a good return policy for these things."
5,Excellent router bits,I did research and these bit leave edges that only need a light sanding. They are well worth the investment.
5,Awesome diaper cover!,"This is one of the softest diaper covers I have come across. Fantastic quailty, soft on babies legs, protects from leaks. Great great diaper cover!Thank you for a fantastic product."
2,a mild intro to the uilleann bagpipes of ireland,"this is an okay cd for those who want to listen to the uilleann pipes and are not familar with the insturment.there are familar irish tunes the listener will reconize(wild colonial boy,danny boy)there is an interesting rendition of amazing grace which is often heard on highland pipes.but there are much better cds ,such as ""the gift"" by the jerry o'sullivan or anything by seamus ennis."
3,Excellent if you don't already have his other books,"I own a few other Davis Publications by Ken Vieth, (Engaging the Adolescent Mind: Through Visual Problem Solving and The Visual Experience) so this book was a waste of money for me as all the best projects are repeated in this book as well. Excellent resource otherwise."
3,not for MS,the book looks like it has some great ideas. Does not appear to be for middleschoolers though
5,From a pentecostal,"As a Pentecostal Pastor I have great appreciation for this work by a Reformed minister. Too often ministers in my circles either downplay the OT or they make it man centered instead of christ centered. The book strictly demands that all scripture be interpreted by the hermenutic of the gospel message, something I strongly agree with.In the first half he develops his arguements. In the second he shows how this can be practically applied to different genres of Biblical writting."
5,Great Resource,A great book by a great scholar. This was required reading for my Homiletics class and also useful for my Biblical Theology class.Pro Tip: Goldsworthy is Australian. Read it to yourself in an Australian accent and you comprehend it way more!
4,How to preach Christianly on the Old Testament.,"Graeme's book offers a hands-on approach to presenting God's word to God's people, with a distinctively Christian flavour. How are Christians to think about Nehemiah, or Esther? How can a Christian sermon on the Old Testament be distinctively Christian? Graeme takes us through the whole Bible, with special emphasis on the Old Testament, and gives us practicle tips on understanding the Law, History, and Prophets. He also then gives us help on proclaiming that message."
3,Insight,"My motivation for reading this book was to gain insight into the astounding acting talent and integrity of one of Jennifer Lash's sons, Joseph Fiennes.She was the formative influence in his life and I was curious as to what is was about her that could produce such results.She took her pilgrimage as a result of having survived cancer and now questioned some of the beliefs on which she had heretofore based her life, namely her Catholic faith. Non catholics may have a difficult time understanding the significance of the holy sites that she visits on her pilgrimage. However, this is not a syrupy, God is Love kind of tome. She does not necessarily believe in God and is objective about the arcane practises that have grown up around these ""holy"" places. Women, particularly, will identify with her need to go off on a solo journey at midlife. They also will understand that as she attempts to find answers she only comes up with more questions."
2,I didn't finish the book,"It was too wordy and because I don't know much about the Catholic Saints it was very confusing. This was not fun or enjoyable to read. It was more like an assignment than for pleasure, which is why I didn't bother finishing it. There are too many other good books out there to read than to waste my time finishing this one. My book club read this and all of us found it very blah. If you do decide to read it I hope you find it as interesting as the other reviewers did -- but notice that they even found a lot of problems with the prose and editing."
1,DVD could not be played - did not work,DVD could not be played - was not usable unfortunately. Do not recommend this one as I was not able to view it. The DVD I received appeared to be defective.
4,Entertaining,"An entertaining, even relaxed and conversational, read. It recovers some the intellectual history of archaeological theory, albeit not in the most unbiased manner. The most attractive quality of the book remains its ease of reading, it reads just like a fascinating lecture, which, in fact, it was. The book can easily be read over the course of a weekend, or an especially long plane ride.What one will get from the volume depends greatly on what one brings to the volume. The best portion stands as the superlative and unsurpassed ethnoarchaeological work in Northern Alaska, the worst as a very weak discussion of sociocultural evolution.Still, warts and all, it's a valuable read to anyone vaguely interested in archaeology or in the evolutionary development of human culture, which may or may not be an adaptive system relative to its environment."
5,Good Book! Cheap Shipping,This book was cheap and came quickly. It was much cheaper than traveling for it. This book is a basic staple for my library
3,The B-side is better than the A-side,"The only reason I'm giving this single 3 stars is because of the B-side ""Baby It's Yours."" The song is one of the best songs on her album. But don't misinterpret what I'm saying, Mya's album is trash, only a few songs on it are good. So if you want to purchase Mya's album then all I have to say is this, Buyer Beware."
3,SONGS NICE BUT THE VOICE HAS TO GO,"I THOUGHT THE SONG WAS BEAUTIFUL BUT MORE IF IT WAS SONGED BY MONICA OR SOMETHING. BUT I NOTICED SHE SOUNDS JUST LIKE BRITNEY SPEARS, THAT ANNOYING NASAL SOUND."
2,Pointless Nostalgic,Bland. The music does not grab your attention. I have his later cd's and it's obvious he had grown as a musician from this point.Seller was excellent. Will buy from again.
2,He's come a long way baby.....,"Listening to this early Cullum recording gives you a timeline for the expression of his talents. You can discern his emerging style in several of the songs, but his youth and inexperience are glaring. The promise of more to come is certainly there, and there is no doubt that you are listening to an exceptional person. When you follow with Catching Tales, it is astounding to witness the explosion that has occurred in the intervening 4 years. I don't know where he will go from here, but this recording gives the listener an historical perspective on where Cullum has come from."
2,OK for a first CD,"I purchased Twentysomething first. It was great, very original and creative. When I purchased Pointless Nostalgic, I was very disappointed. It was not as good as Twentysomething. I did not see or feel the true Jamie Cullum, however, for a first CD it's not too bad. The only thing I could say is thank god I bought Twentysomething first (It was worth it!)."
4,Youthful Exuberance,"I actually heard Jamie in person this past summer at the Montreal International Jazz Festival. Until then I must confess I was unfamiliar with his work. Jamie is a real talent, polished performer, with incredible energy and pianistic fluidity. This CD is an excellent entree to his style"
2,ghee,"I ordered this. This still has some moisture left . I am from India and I know Ghee. this should be more granular in consistency not like a paste. Good Indian products are either sold in India or England, not in USA. Urmil"
