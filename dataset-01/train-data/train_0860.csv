3,Lost in time,"The problem with game reviews for sports is that they are supplanted by the latest season's games. Kids who are really into them, with knowledge of the players, perhaps having virtual leagues of their own, the so-called ""fantasy leagues"", need and insist upon the most up to date player info, etc. They do not mind setting up the games for accuracy purposes.I on the other hand am older; I can remember the 1960 Pirates lineup, but not the wide receivers of the Dolphins last year. So, for me, I want a game that is simple and sets itself up. This game is not like that, as it assumes you are an enthusiast and will want to set up your teams in detail. As such, I did not have the patience to peruse the game for long and must give it a medium review."
3,"Good, but not great","As usual, Amazon was amazing with their service and e-mail updates. The game, however, is just an xbox port. And for some reason, the developers actually took features out of this version versus the original xbox release.It's fun, but it'd be better to get a console version. If you don't have the money for a console, this version will due."
4,"Pretty good, but not perfect","Good, but not great graphics, I hate when players run then fall on their own (I don't know if this is my controller doing this). Lots of cool features, all time teams, create a team etc. Pretty good, intuitive playability, but not great. Four or 4.25 stars I would say. Overall, I'm pleased and would recommend."
2,NOT LIKE PICTURE,"I ORDERED THE FIRST ONE AND THE STONE WAS UGLY; IT HAD NO RAINBOW. IT WAS ALL MILKY OPAGUE. SO I THOUGHT I JUST GOT A BAD ONE AND I ORDERED ANOTHER ONE, AND WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS JUST AS BAD AS THE FIRST, SO I SENT THEM BOTH BACK. NOT WORTH THE MONEY. MAYBE THEY CAN'T GET A DECENT STONE IN THAT SIZE."
1,Does not work!,"I have not bought a computer product as bad as this one since the early days of computing. After installation of the Nero software, my computer crashed, totally and completely. It took 3 hours of restoring files and deleting the offending files to enable Windows to boot up. We then installed the basic program only-none of the extras-and it seemed to work. It burned one CD and since then crashes repeatedly.Avoid this product-for your own good."
1,Breaks down over brief time,"I received one at christmas time and it broke. Luckily, the store warranty is extended over the holidays and I was able to get it replaced. After a few weeks, the new one broke down in the same way! And too late for the store warranty, and the company doesn't give any kind of warranty. I would NEVER buy this product or ANY product from buslink again."
1,Dies faster than a Star Trek red shirt.,"Okay, read these reviews, because they tell the story.This drive feels cheap, as if it's not solidly built. It worked great for me for about a month(!), then it was coaster after coaster. There are a lot of mediocre disc writers out there and they're all better than this one."
1,Died within five months - SAVE YOUR MONEY,"After only five months, it just up and quit one day. The disk indicator light that flashes when my system is powered up does nothing now and the tray no longer opens (but the power light is on). It has not moved from the location it was originally placed, so I've no clue what the cause of death is. I now question the quality of BUSlink products and will not consider them again when purchasing in the future."
2,Tell me why...,"Hello, I don't think this is a review so much as me venting, so consider yourselves warned. I read the first half of the book in a single sitting, saying, ah, a good book, at last... attractive plot, charming characters, wit, passages that make you go, now why didn't I think of that before?... Then I hit the four-way love scene and waded through it for a while. No, it really doesn't have all that much to do with the story line. And it's boring. And it's long. Maybe later it will turn out to be terribly relevant, but I haven't got the patience tonight. Maybe I'll come back to it when I'm in the mood for erotica. Maybe the actual book will pull me back later and I'll skip forward and read on. With thousands of books to choose from, right here in this room, maybe not. This is the first book of its quality that I've stopped reading in the middle, and it's such a shame. Live long and prosper."
1,Don't spend your money!,"I was so excited to find a 5x lighted magnification mirror. I have other Conair products and thought this would be the same quality. Boy, was I wrong! This light is very dim so if you need the light plus the magnification, please don't spend your money."
2,Conair Makeup Mirror,The mirror is small in size and uses two double AA batteries. I was very disappointed in the amount of light that it puts out. I would not buy again.
3,A wee too small,"For the price, I think they should make the mirror a bit larger.If you are serious about using this everyday, pay a little extra and get the larger sized version.It is great however, its too small, and I have to keep moving side to side to get the mirror to focus where I want it to.But its a great idea to have magnification, and the light!I am planning to buy another one, but the larger one this time."
2,I have to be honest here...,"Unfortunately, I agree with most on this mirror. It's too small and the light is weak. The 'battery power' is bad and the optics suck. That's all folks..."
1,Below Average,"I'd like this Mirror much better, if I could find the replacement lamps for it. Can you help me with this problem?Thank you,Joyce"
1,Way Too Dim,I was never able to use this mirror successfully due to its low light source. Agree with other users--this mirror was no better than an unlighted one.
5,I have had this for 5 years!,"I have had this product for 5 years and the light just went out. Only because of a power surge. I called Conair and ordered replacements for $1.50 each (it requires 2)It should be here in 4-5 business days, no shipping. I take this light when I travel even when we go camping it will run off batteries."
5,TABLE MIRROR WITH MAGNIFICATION,Received product in perfect condition and timely. Use it every day.Second one I have owned as I find the older you get the more you need magnification. I broke my other one and plan on being more careful with this one. Would order from company again.
2,Ditto the short bulb life.,"The mirror is $25 at Target. For that, the bulb should last much longer. It should be easily replaceable too."
2,Not worth It,"The batteries do not last very long. Mirror is very small, not well made and broke very easy. I have had to purchase another mirror to replace it because the mirror broke while trying to adj the mirror position. I was not touching the mirror I was touching the frame and the mirror cracked. The light is not very bright even when the batteries are fresh. The batteries last about 1 hour of on time."
2,Maybe too much magnification,Not too happy with the reflected image. Have to be just the right angle and distance from the mirror to see and then only a small area is clear. Tried with and without my glasses. Maybe too much magnification.
2,Dim light,"The price was right; the product seemed simple and hard to screw up. But ........ the light does no good. It's dim, wimpy. If you want a lighted mirror, vs just a mirror, don't buy this. Investigate a corded, plug-in."
2,Not enough light....,"The zoom function and flippable mirror are convenient, but I got this specifically to be a ""lighted"" mirror. The light is almost worthless. I get better illumination from my overhead 60W soft-white. If it's a lighted mirror you're looking for, might want to keep searching."
3,Light is too dim,"I needed to scale down my old corded lighted makeup mirror and this mirror was the perfect size for me. It takes up minimal space on my desk which is where I always get ready. However, the light is very dim. I can't say I was surprised about that though since it runs on 3 AA batteries instead of electricity. It's an okay product but I wouldn't buy this particular lighted mirror unless you have a lot of natural light already or a good overhead light, or unless you just don't need much light to put on makeup."
2,Light is very dim,I bought this at walmart. The light is useless. It is very dim. I like the size of the mirror thought. It's not too small or too big. Fits perfectly on my vanity table.
2,Light is weak,"This mirror is fine as a double sided mirror, but the light, when run with battery is weak. The battery option is why I purchased this model. It does not provide enough illumination by itself to be that useful."
3,Lighted Magnifying Mirror needs a brighter light,Mirror has good magnification. The light is insufficient. Battery-power makes it portable and doesn't limit where you can you it.
1,BAD LIGHT,"Bought for Fiance as a christmas present, light went out before new years with 20 mins of use per day."
1,Poorly designed,"I agree with a previous reviewer. This mirror could just as well be an ""unlighted mirror"" for the amount of light it gives off. I returned it after one use."
1,Light bulb burns out quickly,"I purchased this because it was so cute, and had the Conair name. Within 6 weeks, the bulb blew out, and I started looking for a replacement. Ive been to all the local places, and everyplace I could find online. In an obscure place I found the bulb with the right voltage but not the right wattage. The only place I could get the correct bulb was on the conair website -- but they make you buy 10 bulbs, then charge $9.00 for handling. The cost is more than just buying a new mirror! a rip off!"
1,Ineffective Magnification,The mirror's light is quite dim and the magnification (5x)is inadequate for most purposes.
2,What do you expect for $20,"I am now going through what everyone else is talking about.Finding replacement bulbs. For $20 this is unfortunatelyfor some a ""throw away"" mirror. At least ours lasted morethan 4 weeks."
1,"Help, I can't see!","I don't know why they bothered putting a ""light"". You can't even begin to see good enough to put on make up or anything. I bought this mirror and ended up returning it. I would recommend they make the light a LOT brighter."
1,Don't buy!,"The on /off switch didn't work after the first couple of times I used it. I don't have the time to return it, so had to junk it. Poor quality product."
3,Granddaughter's Makeup Mirror,"Thought the mirror was bigger, didn't pay attention to dimensions in description...love the idea of battery operated, can be moved/used anywhere"
2,Poor quality,The lighting is inadequate. The battery compartment is poorly constructed so that the batteries have to be shimmed to work. Not worth the money.
2,Keys popping off,"Maybe I just got a lemon, or maybe I've used it beyond its allotted lifespan (about four months!!??), but several of the keys keep popping off. I've tried everything to get them to stick back on, and sometimes I think I've succeeded. But a few strokes later, off they come again. Really, really annoying. Nevertheless, I'm ordering another of these miserable things: The design is good, I's used to it, and maybe next time around I'll get lucky."
2,Keyboard is too Cramped,"I didn't realize that the keys would be so compact like a laptop. Since I hate typing on a laptop, I couldn't get used to this keyboard and returned it.I did like how little space it took on the desk though, but I feel typing longterm on this keyboard will bring back my wrist pain again. So back to the $20 Microsoft ergonomic keyboard I go!"
5,She loved it,"My wife loved this item. No, it does not replace a true hot-tub. Would you really expect that for 50 bucks? But she really did like it. She said when she closed her eyes she felt as though she was in a whirlpool. The kids, however, do think it turns the tub into a hot-tub. It is quiet, and rather powerful and overall worth it. I was impressed at the power of the jets and the motor is low noise. When I walked into the bathroom it sounded like a bubbly hot-tub. I would recommend it."
3,It is OK,"I purchased this product after the dog chewed through the cord of my last one. (different brand, cheaper). So when I decided to replace it, I wanted to ""move up"". I am a bit disappointed with it. It is not any better, in my opinion, than my previous one that approximately $20 cheaper."
3,Not Bad,"I went into a thift store two months ago with a friend not knowing what to expect . My friend kept pitching that it being the first saturday of the month everything would be half price. I picked this exact model up marked $2.99 and thought it must be a model from 100 years ago and not work. Not finding anything else interesting to buy I did purchase this for the $1.49 sale price and I must say it's very nice for a portable type spa. It blows out a strong current, it has the emergency shut off plug , and last but not least it has filters that keep it from getting clogged . It does not heat the water nor does it keep your water warm. I use it on my back for my fibromyalgia and it does a good job on a small area of your body once you get it adjusted. This product has not scratched or marked my tub in any way."
3,conair deluxe hydro bath spa,I like it and would recommend this product. I only wish it had more power
1,POS,"This spa was the first and only Amazon purchase i ever returned.I was really psyched to have ordered it as my original conair spa bts1d had gone kaput after 3 years(i loved it).I figured the bts2 would be a coupla steps up,WRONG WRONG WRONG and WRONG was i.This thing is huge and bulky,it takes up 3x more room than the bts1d did,has one fourth the power,and was a huge disapointment for me.It has a so called mood light,BFD.Save your money,time,and anxiety by NOT purchasing this thing.You'll be glad you didn't.I found my original model thru one of Amazon's pvt dealers and i had a good experience w/ this gentleman,PLUS i've got me a brand new Bts1d spa,and it just rocks my world baby!"
5,Buble Bath Choice,I bought this for my 7 yr. old son who love to take buble bath this Bath Spa did this job well.
1,Los Angeles - Quintessential,"This is by far and away the worst DVD I have ever seen. Cluncking mikes, wobbly pictures. No redeeming features."
1,A Guy and His Camcorder,"This video should be called ""A Guy and His Camcorder."" It's shakey footage that plays like somebody's boring home movies set to a tranquilizing music track with no narrative."
4,Just What I Was Looking For...,"I decided to purchase these straps for our toyhauler RV awning right after we saw a trailer in front of loose its awning on the freeway! It was like watching it in slow motion.... My only complaint is they are a tad pricey, but not compared to the cost of replacing an awning. I guess I could have MacGyvere'd something out of velcro from craft store for cheaper but I have 2 little ones at home...I'll order from amazon long before I drag 2 kids anywhere, especially when I'm not really sure what I'm looking for!"
2,uncomfortable,"it's a bit crinkly and doesn't really absorb anything, it's just like wearing an extra shirt but less comfortable. Also, the price doesn't match the quality. The size is pretty big, which might be good for some people, but it's not great at locking in moisture or anything of the sort. It's made from cheap cotton and isn't stretchy at all... so... I didn't care for it."
2,Judge a book by its cover,An ugly book with an ugle title. I should have trusted my instinct. This book is disappointing. Don't believe in the good reviews posted here. Many of them seem to be written by the same person.All of the contents in the book can be found on the web and you don't have to pay nothing.
2,Spend Your Money Elsewhere,"Nowadays, Search Engine utilization should be only a part of your overall marketing. Anyone who still believes that you can get to the top of a search engine is in a for a bad surprise. Is there any reason why the major portals are spending their marketing money elsewhere? Think again, think SMART!"
1,This book is way to outdated to be of any help!,"This book is copyrighted in 2000. In five years the internet has changed so much that this book is of little use. Many of the URLs listed in the book are outdated (the sites are no longer there!). Google is now the number one search engine, and what little information the book has on it is outdated. For example, keywords and titles have NO effect on your Google rating. This book should either be updated or discontinued so that buyers don't waste their money!"
4,Use as Training Manual,"While any book on the search engines is basically out-of-date by the time it is published, there is basic information which needs to be understood in order to build a solid foundation in this business. Planet Ocean and the SearchEngineForums.com are great on-line resources for the latest information - but you do need a good solid understanding to grasp the issues. This book helps the newbie get up to speed quickly. We give the book to our new employees and they can get a solid grasp of this business in two days and ready for our extensive advanced training on search engine positioning."
1,Too Basic!!,"... this book is too basic. You can prepare good Web pages but getting to the top of search results requires much more efforts. Unfortunately, this book does not teach you how to do it. Don't let it fool you."
2,What can I say,"Yes, it's a good source but it is also missing a great deal of the greatest and latest. Just do a search on the Web and you will see that this book is obsolete.SEO without Google is OES as in ObSoletE."
4,Search Engine Optimazation 101,"-I purchased this book when it was first published. Back then I would have given it 5 stars. Although some of the resources & techniques are no longer being used, this is an excellent book for anyone who wants to get a good understanding about how search engines work and how to optimize their web pages. I still refer to it to remind myself of some the techniques I can use.The pro of owning this book is you can read it offline and all of the info is in one place unlike having to visit multiple websites & reading from the screen.The con is some of the info is dated.There is still enough good info in this book to make it worth getting.However, if you wnt to get listed high in the search engines ""quickly"" you'll need the help of advance software like AddWeb Pro to automate most of the work you'll need to do."
3,The Weakest of the Series,"Of the 6 seasons, this one has to be the weakest. After the amazing fourth season, this one seemed to be treading water. That's not to say it didn't have it's moments. Charlotte's storyline regarding the Jewish attorney was hilarious. Miranda's motherhood was explored realistically. However, Carrie and Samantha stories seemed to be repetitive.I did like Carrie having to do a book signing with that ""alien"" dog a highlight. I wished there was more of Amy Sedaris. She should have been a bigger character. Maybe if the season had been longer there would have been more time to flesh out the stories. Understandably, Sarah Jessica Parker's pregnancy had something to do with it. Overall, I enjoy this show over most on regular television. However,this DVD should not cost as much as it does for only 2 discs and 8 episodes.I don't believe the quality alone justifies the price."
3,Agree with everyone else...HBO ripped us off!,"I also thought that there was some mistake when I saw that there were only two discs, both which I had already rented. I figured that I was missing the other two and was actually prepared to return it to the store! What the hell is up with the price HBO?? Since I don't have HBO at home, I'm going to have to wait until the series is completely over to know what happened during the real second-half of Season 5.I love Sex and the City. I don't want it to end. But come on..the price on this season should have been reduced."
3,Less bang for my buck,"I did enjoy this season, as I do with every season of Sex and the City. I don't think season 5 was a throw-away season. Although I do hesitate to spend this much on only 8 episodes. Granted - they are a great 8 episodes. But so are the other episodes where I get 18ish episodes for the same price.I think I'll wait for season 6 to come out and see if this price goes down. I'm just not willing to spend that much money on such little product."
1,Not me,I love the series but I will do without these 8 episodes. I refuse to pay the same amount for 8 episodes that I pay for a full season. NO WAY!
1,RIPPED OFF!!!!!,"I FEEL COMPLETELY RIPPED OFF!!!!Only eight episodes for the price of a full season, What a bargain.If you buy this season beware your only getting eight episodes. I only whish I had known before I spent my hard earned money."
1,Lower the price,"I love the show but the price is too high for this quarter of a season! Talk about taking advantage of the fans! The season is ok, not the greatest. Carrie hooks up with Big again (yawn) and Charlotte meets & romances her divorce lawyer is the funniest character to come along in ages. Miranda adjusts to being a new mom and Samantha is still reeling from her break-up with Richard. The season ends on a high note with Samantha single again, Charlotte in love, Miranda coping & Carrie finding a prospective new love."
1,Jipped in the City,I have to agree with most of the reviews. I have seasons 1-4. The 5th season is only 8 sub-par episodes. You know they could have done better ... the sixth season is awesome. I love these girls ... but I have to agree ... the price is too high for what you get. I will probably skip it and wait for the final season to come out and buy it. Maybe season 5 will come down and I'll add it to my collection later.
2,Here here,"I have this season on VHS, taped off HBO when it aired. That may very well be where it will stay unless I find this cheaper. This season had some good moments such as, the trip to CA and the meeting with Big, the conversion to Judaism, and the baby, but the price is outrageous compared to what you're getting in the other seasons. Yes, price is also what we are reviewing. Not just content. Maybe if they had added some 'behind the scenes' or outtakes or something like that, maybe it would be more enticing, but there doesn't seem to be any such thing on this DVD.If this show doesn't end the way everyone is hoping and expecting, season 6 may also be a dud."
2,Worse Season Ever...Here's Why...,"Yes, this is the worse of the seasons on DVD so far -- primarily due to the lack of good writing, attempted (but failed) character growth, and the deeply curtailed number of episodes (count them, eight). Now I LOVE Samantha's character's quick-witted sayings: ""Vagina weights?"" Sam: ""Honey, my vagina waits for no man."" It's obvious that Season 5 really strives to be funny, but falls short; jocular arguments with Charlotte over the ""f"" word just aren't funny. I admit the characters have gone through a lot of growth: a baby, broken engagement, Sam's love, broken marriage. But dammit, lame themes and horrible dialog screw up good episodes! Don't pay more than $... unless you're a dedicated fan."
2,A Product Has Many Sides,"Reviewing a DVD means reviewing all of its product details: the quality, the content, the PRICE included. With ""price"" mentioned, let me just say that this is one expensive DVD set for what you're getting. Had the fifth season been 18 episodes like all of its predecessing seasons, then dropping 50 dollars for this package would be as simple as before. But you can count 'em right here: 8 episodes. Logically, you would expect that since we barely got 1/2 of a regular season we should only pay for about 1/2 of the regular season DVD price but apparently, that's not how the tides turned. Understandably, capitalistic interests got in the way of this negotiation but c'mon, the fifth season wasn't even that good to begin with! To SATC fans looking to purchase this DVD, don't think I am trying to discourage your buy (it's your money!) but just remember to weigh in all the details of a product; particularly the price of this one."
2,An HBO Cash Cow,"HBO has found a cash cow with these girls, which I think is why it released this pathetic attempt at a season for the same price as a regular length season. These scant 8 episodes are not engrossing and the writing is rather poor. The full bodied wit and the quality of the first four seasons is conspicuously absent here. I don't know if the writers are burned out or what, but each of these episodes is just, well, ""off"" for some reason. Overall, this box set (if you can even call it that) is not a good value, even if you are a fan of the series (which I am)."
4,QUIT COMPLAINING!!!!!,"For God's sakes, is all you people have to do is complain about how much this set is? First of all, yes the season was shorter, because of SJP's pregnancey, but it was still stellar. And if you bought two DVD's for $... a pop you're spending more. I know that all of you giving this negative reviews are just doing so because of the price. And you will all probably go out and buy it anyway. Cheapskates. The season was good, and the series is almost over. For all you Sex and the City fans get this set and enjoy the last episodes before it's over. And all you people whining about the price, stop confusing that with the quality of the series, give honest reviews of the episodes, and if the price of this set is really setting you back. Get better jobs."
4,Quit your b!+c#!ng,"The discs are too expensive, boo hoo, wah wah! Get over it. I agree that the HBO folks SHOULD have lowered the price to make up for the fact that it was a truncated season, but the fact is that they DIDN'T. The product description clearly tells you that you're getting eight episodes. If you don't want to spend the money for eight episodes, then don't. Nobody's holding a gun to your heads. A true fan will savor every moment of the show and wouldn't think of holding it against the Fab Four that the people who produce the DVD's of their show are overcharging us. I wouldn't miss a single episode because of a few dollars. Check out Daniel Sunjata's appearance in the first episode of the season, ""Anchors Away"", which was his introduction to many of his fans."
4,Just as good as seasons 1-4,"I don't know what people are complaining about. These episodes are just excellent. The characters are maturing, physically and emotionally, and what's wrong with that? I especially appreciated how Miranda and her baby were represented. How often do you see real ""working"" breasts on TV in close-up? The baby seems real. It wasn't just born and then disappeared, like on some shows. This baby has had a real effect on Miranda, and it's not a bed of roses. I appreciated this.Anyway, the price is high, but so rent the videos. I rented them without waiting right when they came out."
1,ONLY 8 BLAH episodes???? Come on people!!,"i am a HUGE fan of sac. I knew episodes by heart, this show was like my bible(like most people). I bought ALL seasons eventhough the covers are so cheap and they broke, but id consider buying them again since i love this show so much and its a MUST for my dvd collection! But this season......I didnt buy it cause i knew it would only be 8 episodes. i just rented it out first and i dont plan to buy it. In all fairness though.... im sure it wouldnt hurt them much to just lower the price! You're buying less than half the material on other seasons. Plus the episodes where..... what happened to this show? It just seemed to repeat itself but in a more superficial way. Where was all that turning of the stomach the other seasons had? This was boring and looked like the whole season was filmed in one day. Very dissapointing.If youre going to start a show with a huge bang, dont end it so blandly!"
2,Simply Pathetic!!!,"OMG, what a waste of time. This season was so terrible. The first time I saw SATC I thought that those women were so inspiring and free, I felt in love with all of them, too bad I can't say the same thing about this season. Carried looked older and tired and I didn't like the fact that they tried to hide her big belly, it looked obvious and ridiculous (couldnt' they wait for her to give birth?). Her jokes were not at all funny and they were kind of force. Samantha was disgusting, gosh... what a repulsive pathetic woman. The other two were kind of the same, thank God!"
4,Better Than You Remember,"I read the reviews here, and felt the same way -- Season five was the shortest, most disappointing season of them all. And the same price for just two discs! Oy! But then I bought it, and started watching, certain I could breeze through these as a refresher before the last eight episodes of season six. Much to my surprise, I found myself watching each episode a couple of times. These eight episodes, more than any other, humanized the four women. Lonely, frustrated, and determined, the four main characters put out some of the funniest and most touching moments in the show's history. I almost forgive them for season five being so short!"
2,Too Expensive,I love the show but season five was not worth the forty dollars I paid for it. It should have been cheaper since we are only getting 8 episodes. I bought season five so that I would have a complete collectin.
2,Ripoff!,Since when does 8 episodes equal a season? Way overpriced for what you get. I actually had to check the case to see if it was defective. What a total ripoff!
5,Great for true fans,"There has been talk that season 5 sucked, but that is only for the superficial fans wanting just sex and no depth or humour behind it. The 4 main characters (Charlotte, Carrie, Samantha, and Miranda) really grow and the season is irreverent, funny, touching, and all actors are fabulous!!! I watched all 8 episodes and was left yearning for more!!!"
1,Was this set their idea of a paid vacation??!!,"I couldn't wait to get season five. Got it in, and expected at least 12 episodes. I saw only 2 dics and thought there must be another one somewhere! How disappointing!! You would think that they would at least charge less for this DVD than all the others, considering there is less on it. With only 8 episodes to watch, I feel very shorted. This season just didn't do it for me, how long till season 6??!"
5,Classic SATC!,The curl-up-in-your-bed for a girls'night classic strikes again with season 5. Classic SATC gang in comedic and entertaining situations.Gotta love it!
2,Might be worth a rental?,"I absolutely love ""Sex and the City"", but 8 mediocre episodes for over $30 is a crime. I admit that i was very excited to watch season 5 as I had been watching all of the episodes on DVD only. However, the fact that season 5 is only 8 episodes, still costs $32, and just didn't have the same freshness and unique feel as the first four seasons was a major disappointment. Something is just missing all around here. If you are worried about missing something, rent it, otherwise, wait for season 6."
3,Sex and the City Season 5,"I dont have HBO so i have to rely on the seasons coming out on DVD and i was disappointed on how many episodes were on each disc. I asked for the set for Christmas and felt bad for my boyfriend for spending so much money on almost nothing. I love Sex and the City but not for 40 bucks. I agree they are worth renting, not buying. Not much really happened and i would have been better off saving money and waiting until the 6th season comes out."
1,I too am mad...,Only 8 episodes?? Previous box sets have had 16 or so in them. If you really want to watch this - rent it at Blockbuster - don't waste your $ on purchasing it.
3,yea its a rip,"I really didnt enjoy this season... and I want to buy it.. probably used in the long run just to have in my collection, but for now, I trust my faithful downloading softwear to keep money in my pocket and my mind pseudo-entertained. Thanks for sharing."
4,Very Under-rated!!,"I have read other reviews on here and reluctantly bought this DVD because all ""Sex and the City"" fans, pretty much, seem to agree that this season was big fat mess at worst or a waste of time at best. Although I don't appreciate HBO jacking up the price either, I found this season great. No there weren't grand dramatic story arcs like usual, but this needed to happen to these characters. ANd two of the lead actresses were pregnant!!For once, they aren't really dealing with the current guy in their life and focusing on other things. I have been keeping pace with this show with the DVD releases, so god knows when season 6 will be out, but beyond the extravagant price and annoying lag time between seasons on DVD, I recommend this season wholeheartedly for any true fan."
2,Bashful's DVD Summary #005,"Best:1) Charlotte gets wilder (and even flashes a breast in the very first episode).2) There's writer/director commentaries on 3 episodes (from two feminine males).3) Samantha's knowledge of vibrators is absolutely hilarious in episode 6.Worst:1) There were only 8 episodes in this season - enough said.2) Too much time was spent on dreary emotional issues and forced sentimentality.3) There was no good nudity or hot sex scenes (and Samantha was just a big tease).Recommendation:The high retail price and low overall amount of humor or sex are big reasons to NOT recommend this season. If you have seasons 1-4 already and you can get this one for LESS than half price (used), consider adding it to the mix ONLY if you're a HUGE Charlotte fan and a complete SATC fanatic. Otherwise, wait until season 6 and don't feel bad."
2,Total garbage... in comparison with the previous 4 seasons,SATC went downhill after the fourth season. I guess they ran out of original ideas or concepts. The fifth season was exceptionally lame.
2,Still too much,"Why do they want 13.99 for a short not very good season? There were lots of reviews saying the very same thing, but now they are all gone. I guess this will get deleted too. I have 2,3 & 4"
5,For the wife,My wife is a huge fan of this series and somehow this season went missing. So ordered replacement only to find a week later. That aside very good show highly recommend.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,This DVD only has 8 episodes on it (from what I've read) and is still being sold at the regular price!!! I've been such a devoted fan and own all previous seasons...I feel like I'm being ripped off! I think I'll wait until it's in the bargain bin...from what I've heard there'll be plenty of copies.
2,TOO EXPENSIVE,I am a true fan of SATC and this being said I find it very difficult to want to purchase the 5th season at the price they are asking. This is highly unreasonable. There are only 8 episodes here people. A simple $$$$ price would do. If it does not go down to that I will NOT be purchasing the 5th season and that will be disappointing.
3,2 DVD's?!?!?!,I enjoyed the episodes but was disappointed that I payed more for 2 DVD's and 8 episodes than I did for seasons 3 and 4 with about 8 episodes on each of the 3 disks!
2,It's too short,"My favorite show was a bit choppy this season. Although I totally enjoyed the episodes, I just can't pay the same price for this season as i did for the other seasons. Can't believe HBO didn't take this into consideration when they were pricing it. 8 half hour shows. That's it. Unless the price comes down, or the package deal is really attractive for all of the seasons, Season 5 will be missing from my collection. Sad, because I liked it."
2,Season cut short,"Since season 5 was cut short due to Sarah Jessica Parker's pregancy, I think they should combine season 5 and 6 for one price instead of charging the same thing for only 8 episodes. I adore Sex and the City and will miss it dearly. At least I have my DVDs to watch over and over. I love my ""girls of summer""!!!"
1,HBO is greedy,"I was all set to pre-order this DVD as I have purchased the first four seasons. But after seeing the other reviews and realizing this only has a shorten season but the regular price, I have decided not to buy it. HBO is just too greedy. I probably wont buy the remaining seasons either. I hope more people also skip buying this DVD. That is the only way HBO will learn they can't rip people off like this."
1,Bad Sex and the City for HBO...,"Being a huge Sex and the City fan, I've decided not to pay into HBO's greed and buy the 5th. season on DVD. It's only 8 episodes long and double disc...why are we being charged full price? Why couldn't they put in an extra disc of extras or bloopers? Frankly, it's not worth the $33. I think I've had too much Sex and the City this time around...bye girls!"
1,HBO Is Disappointing,"No doubt that the DVDs of this series is the most sought after. But HBO is just too much! Pricing $32 for 8 miserable episodes! If you want to fight piracy, you should respect people who buy original copies by pricing the DVDs reasonably! The most I'd pay for 8 episodes would be $15! And you know what? A lot of people turned to the pirated copies because of the arrogant people such as those in HBO demanded an unreasonable price!"
2,This DVD stinks...,I hope Sarah Jessica Parker is happy with herself...She just screwed her fans with this DVD...I paid 40 bucks for 8 episodes...What a ripoff...Money-grubbing-Wh*re...
2,Sex and the City - The Complete Fifth Season,I love seeing the episodes again with my friends and roommates
5,No problems,"This product seemed like it took a long time to be shipped to me, but it was still within the time frame. Usually the product seems to get to me faster, even with the lowest priced shipping. Otherwise, no problems"
1,This show went from good to bad,"People are a little too emotional about this show. The first few seasons were pretty good. The characters have become tired, the dialogue repititious and the story lines predictable. It is not a matter of how much this DVD costs, or how many shows you are getting. Put away your accounting visors. It is about a show that was a fresh idea with ground breaking dialogue that became tired, dull and common. Do not buy this DVD. It says much about our culture that we continue to watch and support shows like this long after they become tired. We are conditioned by what we think is cool. This show has become so far from cool, it is the Sally Struthers of HBO series. If you are into HBO and ""ground breaking"" comedy, pre-order Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm. A guy that shouldn't be cool, a total nebbish, will become the coolest cat you know."
3,Forgetable short but sweet season,"I wa supset that theres only 8 episodes for season 5 but with the real life pregnecies of 2 of the actress it had to be cut short. Overall not the best season but it's still enjoyable. Not much happens in this forgetable season as the lady just more whine then they do have fun. But it's irrestable not to laugh at the charactors and it'smposiable not to love. Wee see Carrie's carror take off, Samantha learns what love is and the aftermath of a breakup, Charlette tries to be fun but her charactor gets lost in the other charactors, and Meranda deals with being a mother."
3,Has its moments ...but,"I think we can all agree from the reviews here, that Season 5 is not a crowd pleaser. Shooting was done around Sarah and Cynthia's real life pregnancies and this kind of spoilt it ... because Carrie looks pregnant throughout this season, and we all know her character is opposed to having a child. As a result, she wears the most ridiculous costumes in this Season to try to hide it, which does not match her usual fashionable style. You have to wonder why filming wasn't just put on hold.Despite this, the season has its rewarding episodes out of the eight on offer. IN particular, when Charolotte meets Harry, and Sam's vibrator.The biggest problem with this season is that it is quite depressing, and none of the characters seem to want to be there. Fortunately, the fun atmosphere picks up again in time for Season 6. AS another reviwer pointed out, you can almost skip Season 5 and go straight to Season 6."
2,Half the episodes & Half the fun,"The fifth season seems to have lost its way on the trip from the first to the sixth season. With a few exceptional moments, the rest of it was a sad let down. The only good part of the fifth season is that it sets up the sixth season which is the best of the six."
3,Started off slow,"I've read a lot of reviews where people said Season 5 is not all that great. Well it does start off slow. I guess they got thrown off by Sarah's pregnancy. When I watched the first DVD of Season 5 I was not all that impressed. But by the end of of the DVD I had episodes I laughed at.anchors away - was rather dullunoriginal sin - was okay, but still did not wow meluck be an old lady - This episode made me laugh. The scene when they told off the guy in the casino.....I kept watching that scene over and over. Also is it me, but Miranda seems to have lost some of her spunk after giving birth. Because the old Miranda would have told that guy off!!!cover girl - my favorite episode on the DVD."
3,Should cost $19.99,"I am an avid fan who owns season 1-4, however, I refuse to purchase season 5 for the list price. How can you go from 18 shows in season 4 to 8 shows in season 5 and still charge the same amount? That's ridiculous! I'll tape the reruns!!"
4,worth it all the way,"Okay, let me start by saying, you all knew there would only be 8 episodes in this season! It says so in the description! So, you should have known what you were getting into even before they were released! Okay, that being said, SATC is a great show, and I love it even more now that I am living outside the country and don't have HBO. SATC has been a taste of home and continues to be my favorite way to pass the time!"
4,Come on,"Oh come on, it's really not this bad. I bought the DVD today and after reading all these reviews I was expecting these 8 episodes to be absolutely horrible. And you know what, they aren't. They may not be the cream of the crop, and they certainly aren't the best to come out of this show, but they are still entertaining, and that's what this show it all about. It's not a life changing show with deep views and moving topics, but it's something to relax and just laugh with, and at. These are not the best epsiodes, but they are still enjoyable. I'm glad I spent my hard earned, whopping 35 dollars on it (gasp, 35 dollars-oh my! oh my!) and I plan to invest in the next season when it comes out, too."
1,Not worth the price.,"I own all four of the previous seasons, all of which I purchased for $30 or LESS, but as much as I love the show I won't be buying this season at retail. Hopefully the good people selling at eBay will be more realistic. Two discs for the price of four? HA, NO."
3,A good show already in steep decline,"Sex in the City always has it's funny and interesting moments, but by season 5 it was running a little dry. The situations the characters got in were progeressively stupider and stupider and some of the humor was far too crude to fit the tone. However, it was still worth watching, though I wouldn't buy this season unless I was a huge fan."
1,What a ripoff!,"The show's worst season, and the same high price as the previous ones, but for only EIGHT episodes! And notice how the posted product info claims it is ""540 minutes""? That's either a convenient misprint or an outright lie; it should read 240 minutes (8 x 30 min., which it does on the box). Then, for the final Season 6, the corporate money-grubbers split it up into two overpriced ""parts,"" probably because they realized that that particular cash-cow was now coming to an end and they'd best milk it for all it's worth. HBO=AOL/Time-Warner, of course. Nice way to treat your fans, very nice."
5,ALL of the seasons of Sex and the City are priceless!,"Sex and the City is absolutely the best show ever made, no matter how long the seasons are. This season revealed and resolved many issues, including Samantha finally getting rid of Richard, Carrie's newfound success, the intro of Berger, AND the intro of Harry. It is vital to the completion of the series. I have all seven dvds sets for the series, and I would pay for even a final episode (if it wasn't in the last half of the sixth), because it's that great. You can't be a real fan without appreciation for this season, no matter how short it is or who is pregnant (and wearing funny clothes). In fact, I think it's even funnier with SJP pregnant, because her outfits are more creative so they can hide her belly."
1,EXPENSIVE,"How can a short season cost as much as a full season, you get the feeling that the girls really aren't into it as much, I for one will miss them as the show was one of my highlights of the week, and what will they do next?"
2,Where's the Disk???,Yes the viewing of this season was good but where are the other episodes?? I fell like I was just ripped off. I am not at all happy with this and would let everyone know it is not worth the price for 8 episodes.. You got me this time.
3,SATC 5,"While I am a diehard SATC fan, and of course had to buy this set to complete my collection, I must admit that the pricing on Season 5 is too much for what you get. We were ripped off already with a short season and there is no reason for HBO to have priced it so that we are ripped off again. The extras were disappointing since the description for the dvd set had me expecting more of them. Overall I would have to say that if you are a diehard fan, this is a must have to complete your collection. If you are on the fence, wait for Season 6 to come out which will be well worth your money."
3,"5th Season, Worst Season","After watching the 5th season of Sex and the City, I believe it's the worst of the six. There's very little substantive character development, if any. Carrie's self-involvement reaches epic proportions. The fifth season's strongest attribute is that it's the shortest season."
3,Love the show-hate this season!,"To echo the sentiments of fellow Amazon-ers that were equally disappointed with this dramatically shorter, yet BORING season of SATC...it stinks! I'm an avid fan that typically collects what I love, but hey...half the season, half the price!As with others...I'll anxiously await season 6!"
1,Poor excuse for SEX,"I am an avid ""Sex"" fan, and we were most disappointed not only with the lack of episodes, but with the lack of plots. Let's hope that they are saving the best for last............."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD,"I also love Sex and the City, but after this season, I know why they decided to only go for one more. I don't know what happened, but this season failed to spark any interest. I must have forgot how boring it was when I bought it. A friend and I sat at home one night, and unfortunately wasted hours of time on this DVD. My reccomendation is to wait for the 6th season...you aren't missing anything!"
1,HBO you disappoint me! 2 DVD's? Where are the extras?,"While I absolutely love the women of SATC on HBO, I am a bit disappointed. 2 DVD's only? I was willing to pay anything until I saw the price. I own all the DVD's and VHS so I can watch ""my girls"" anytime without worry that they do not have a DVD player... but for this edition... I am pissed! Does the set come with behind the scenes action? Where is the ""meat"" in this boxed set? I do not think I will be purchasing this set... despite being a very big fan of the show. This season is one of the most slow seasons ever. It was almost torture to watch the tragedy unfold."
1,Greedy and smart,"I pretty like the whole series. I own all the previous seasons, but I will be very reluctant to buy the 5th seacon just because of the unreasonable high price. HBO charges $49.99 for only 2-disc. Is it greedy? I even heard that HBO will split the 6th season into two parts. So we need to pay $100 for only one season. Is HBO too smart?"
2,OUCH!,The 5th series was fun and short but will not be in my DVD collection at this price. Seems a bit steep for such a short season in contrast to other offerings.
1,Wait for Season Six,"The producers of Sex And The City seem to have gotten it back together for Season 5 after a whiny Season 3 and a quirky Season 4. As a fan, though, I am sorely disappointed that a half-season has been priced so high. I'm expecting Season 6, when it does appear, to accommodate the loss that this release will incur, so their combined prices will complete the insult to collectors worldwide. No thanks, I'm waiting for the next season. And if you're reading, HBO, please do include real special features in your next release -- like the farewell episodes of the series and perhaps a guide to the gals' wardrobe."
1,"Save your money - terrible season, terrible value","Eight measley episodes. Almost no special features.When SJP got pregnant, HBO gave us 8 episodes, took a break, then gave us ""bonus"" episodes a few months later. I guess the bonus ones got stuck with season 6, because they're missing."
3,"Fantastic Show, Bad Disc","Why pay $30-$50 for eight episodes, is my only question.This is one of the best television series EVER, but unfortunately HBO decided to be ridiculous and put a $50 list price on four hours of footage and some bland extras.I ask you - why pay this? Two-three hour films with extensive bonus footage (see Gangs of New York, Moulin Rouge, Pirates of the Carribean) are less than half that cost, and while Amazon and stores such as Wal-Mart are nice enough to sell the disc for $30, we are STILL paying too much!!I do own Season One of SATC and plan on compelting my collection as soon as possible, but this does not change the fact that I feel a unjustice was made in overpricing this disc and all of HBOs DVDs. Unfortunately, the HBO shows ranks alongside Friends, Alias, Will & Grace, and The O.C. as the only TV-on-DVD discs worth purchasing."
1,RIP OFF !,I bought this for my wife for Christmas. She already has the other 4 seasons. I thought there was a mistake with the DVD since there were only 2 discs. I would NEVER have bought this if I had known I was only getting half a season for full price.8 shows for $35? That is only 4 hours of material. HBO should be ashamed of themselves!I'm not a big fan of the show but I have seen all the other seasons and thought they were OK. I can't even get through the first disc on season 5.
2,Too expensive!!!!!!!,I am not rating this season low because of content--the content was excellent--and I realize that the pregnancies of Sarah Jessica and Cynthia are unavoidable...but come on! Don't charge us all the same price for less than half of the normal number of episodes!!!
2,Wait for season six,"This is a great show, and season six has been fantastic, but season five was just not up to par. The two stars I gave it are for 1)Charlotte's affair with Harry and 2)the last episode (the wedding in the Hamptons.) Those were the only highlights!"
1,Are you kidding?!?,"2 Discs, that's all you get for the price of the other sets? This is a very bad decision from somebody. Sadly, this season will not be making it into my DVD collection until the price reflects what you are getting."
1,What's with this price???,"I have bought every season of Sex and the City, LOVE them...I WILL not be buying season five. The series hit an incredible low spot--there were no cliff hangers, the dvd ""set"" is a mere 8 episodes--who do they think they are kidding? Spend your money elsewhere!"
2,Full Price for Half Content?,"I own Seasons 1-4, and had Season 5 been under $20, I would have purchased it just to be complete. But, and let's face it, Season 5 was terrible anyway! The writing was WAY OFF and SJP wasn't even likeable, which is hard to believe! The episode where they took the train and the zit humor was incredibly lame, as so many of the episodes (gee, all 8? ha!) were. I need to read a synopsis of each episode just to remind myself why I'm glad I'm NOT buying Season 5!"
1,Absurd price for only two discs,"The price on this set, even with the amazon discount, is simply absurd and an insult to the fans of this series. The episodes themselves are not bad whatsoever; in fact this season had some excellent moments, but there is no reason why it should have been released at any rate above $30.00. Like all the reviewers below, I will not be getting this season even if it causes my collection to be incomplete."
2,We're not stupid!,"Eight episodes for the price of 18? No thanks! Answering to the comment along the lines of ""nobody else can do this""...how about ""frasier"" who pulls 22 consistantly hilarious episodes? The price is a disaster on this set! We really need to let these people know that we aren't idiots. I pay for quality AND quantity."
1,NO WAY!,"This was the worst season of all. Even with Sarah Jessica's pregnancy, the stories were bad and seeing only 8 episodes for this price? I'll skip right to Season 6 when that comes out, since you don't have to watch Season 5 at all to continue with Season 6."
3,Gipped and the City!!,"I'm a HUGE FAN of the ""Sex and the City"" series, BUT feel gipped that season 5 only had 8 episodes...... AND even worse that the DVD Discs are selling at the full retail price as all the other seasons in the series!!The episodes were good in season 5, but NOT the price of the DVD's for season 5!"
2,What Happened?,"I love this show. But what happened to Season 5? The jokes, Carrie, less episodes - The show really went down-hill this season."
5,Sex and the City,"Sex and the City Season 5 is excellent, all the seasons are! If you are a big Sex and the City fan like me you should Def. Buy all the seasons! On amazon you get a GREAT deal for all 5!I hope im not the only one whos real upset to see that theres only going to be a few more eposodes left!"
4,Stop Your Whinning!,"People that are B*$%^#$ about the price need to stop. No one forced them to go out and buy it...you bought, so deal with it. I first got addicted to SATC when I received season three as a b-day gift, and let me tell you that it has been the best gift ever. I have bought all the other seasons since then, including the fifth season. Yes, it's not like the others, but it's still good. You gotta think beyond the other seasons...they have differerent life styles now that they are older so you gotta expect something different."
1,PURE AND OUTRIGHT HBO GREED!!!,It's a sad shame that I wont be buying the fifth season of this great show and all because of the ridiculous price.I cant believe they expect us to pay the same price when we only get about half as much content.Do they really think that we are mindless consumers who will pay anything for our favorite shows?The season itself was pretty good but it's too bad it was cut short.I would advise anyone to not purchase this set until they lower the price that way they will be forced to lower the price if no one is purchasing it.SAD SAD SAD!!!
2,Rip off...,The fifth season was not good at all...can you say boring? And the lack of episodes for the price is unfair. BOOOO!
5,In love with sex and the city sequeles!!,"I ordered the 5th season of sex in the city, but the best season was season 6!! I have never had cable, so their you have it,!I also wanted to know how big and carey met, and how charlet and met her jewish husband! all of this was on season 5 and 6. The dvd arrived on time, and it was in great shape, cover to back I was very pleased!!Love Sex In the City!! and Amazon, smile!"
2,Why was this season even made?!,This season was sooo boring and dragged and was just pointless. I could have skipped this season and just went on to season 6 without being lost!
1,Thank God For Discount Stores,The title of this review says it all. My husband got me this season from a discount movie shop for $5. No way we'd be willing to pay full price for a piece of a season.
2,2 out of 3 worked,Received the VHS tapes of Sex and the City Season 5 but one of the tapes just did not play. When I contacted the seller they did not respond. Do not recommend.
5,Carrie lives it up!,"Sex and the City - The Complete Fifth Season is short but sweet. Only 8 episodes because Sarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon were both pregnant at the time so the season was cut short. A lot of reviewers have been complaining about season five, they say it's too boring or sappy but I have to disagree, I love this season so much! Carrie finally got to concerate on herself rather than a man, even though she does meet Jack Berger halfway through but the writing and stories were sharper than ever. My three favorite episodes are Unoriginal Sin, Luck Be An Old Lady, and The Big Journey. Don't sweat, buy this season today!"
2,Should've been named Carrie & the City...,"The fifth season is ALL about Carrie, she seems so needy in this season. It sucks that we are forced to pay almost full price for half the episodes but, on the bright side its only eight episodes of her whinning incessantly. I only bought it to complete the set."
3,eh....,"I don't hate this season, but it definitly isn't the best even disregarding its incredible shortness. This season seemed less funny than the previous and the plots of the episodes were way less creative. it definitly isn't worth the price."
3,So much $ for so little?,"I absolutely love this show but somehow, I just don't feel right paying so much for eight episodes. The episodes were good but not that good. If you're yearning for it then I guess it's okay but come on, so much $$ for so little? I'll wait until it goes for a cheaper price or until someone else buys it for me."
1,Buyer Beware,"I purchased the Crosley CR-57 in brushed chrome in February 2006. Less than a year later, it's inoperable and way out of Crosley's 90 day warranty. Compared to the 1950s Western Electric manufactured phone that Crosley modeled their product from, the Western Electric product lasted for years!"
1,piece of junk from China,"Ordered the chrome wall phone twice! The first return was defective, no voicepiece transmission. Had a phone repair guy come in and replace the jack but it was the phone. I gave it a second try, same defect. What a waste of time. They should not sell this phone to anyone. now I have no interest in any Crosley product, no QA."
4,Children's Wallet & Money,"This is a great little wallet. My son always tries to take his Daddy's wallet to pretend he's paying for groceries or something. We found this wallet w/money & he just loves it! While I wish it were a bit smaller for his little hands (it wouldn't even come close to fitting in a jacket pocket or anything), I definitely recommend this wallet to anyone with a young child."
4,toy wallet,"Fun product for my 3 year old who loves playing with the toy coins from his pre-school and needed his own at home. He loves mimicing mommy and having a wallet of his own to put his own cards in, like a library card. Lots of coins to play with too!"
5,Great toy!,"My daughter always wants my wallet, so I bought this hoping it would take attention away from mine. We added some old credit cards, but it does the trick!"
4,play billfold a hit,"My six year old grandson was carrying one of his mom's old billfolds because it held his change. I ordered this billfold for him and he loves it. He's not interested in the play money that came with it,but loves keeping his own money and change in it."
2,Doesn't meet promise,"Neat idea, but poorly executed. The size is all wrong; too big for a kid's pocket and not aligned so that it can actually velcro closed."
3,Not worth the money,"I received this as a Christmas present for my 2 year old so that he would not steal his older sister's wallets anymore. It is made of nylon and is a three fold. The problem is that once you put all the money that it comes with inside of it it will not close. The zipper seems like it will last but the velcro seems like it will not last long. The money is the same as our cash register so that was nice to have more to go with that set, but still not worth the money for what I was looking and hoping for in this product. I am going to return this and just buy him a regular wallet like his sister's have. I found leather like tinker bell one's for them so I think I should be able to find something suitable for a boy."
3,How to save your money,"Nice colors, plenty of pockets to keep change and bills however, it's to big to put in a kid's pant's pocket or even in a coat's pocket (So told me my grandson)."
4,Very nice .,"Sometimes my 4 year old son, want's to pay his money at the grocery store . It's a lot of fun"
3,"Good wallet, but not very ease to close","Bills are good, coins are good, but wallet is hard to close due to constraction. My daughter (4 years old) likes to play with it."
2,Difficult to close,IF you put more than a few bills in it is difficult to close. The Velcro is placed in such a way to not allow much expansion.
3,Nice little toy for my little guy.,I got this wallet for my little guy because he is always trying to get my wallet and tear it apart. I wish it had more than just 2 credit cards and less coins and dollar bills. The dollar bills also seemed to tear easily. Especially while being used by a rambunctious little guy. Overall it is good.
4,Grandson loved his Cash & Carry Wallet,"Purchased this for my 4 yr. old grandon for Christmas. This was the cheapest gift I bought him and this is the one he played with the most. The only fault I had with this item was when you put all the paper money in the wallet, it wouldn't close."
5,Kids Love It,"I got two of these for my twins so they each have their own. The wallet seems well made and is filled with ""money"". They love having their own play money. This is a useful tool that teaches as they play. I highly recommend this wallet. I do wish there were more color choices, but I solved the problem by ""monogramming"" each wallet with their initial."
4,Integrated Business Projects,"Integrated Business Projects takes a individual or class through many of the aspects of the business office. My students enjoyed working in Integrated Business Projects, until I proofread and graded paper. I do allow them to correct errors and resubmit for better grade. Great text."
2,Integrated Business Projects Teacher manual,The manual is published in rediced print in a book. Difficult to read as an answer key. It is an older book and many companies have switched to CDs. If I had the option I would buy a new updated textbook.
4,A Life Well Lived,"""Killer Cocktail"" is a wonderful combination of love, life, and the choices that we all have to make. Against a background of wealth and privelage, three lovely, educated women try to find their way through personal issues, family issues, and the reality that one of their brother's may end up on trial for killing his problimatic fiance.If you love Kate Spade, Prada,and all things designer ... you will love this book!"
3,Cute...light...fluffy,"This is a cute summer read . . . or a quick fix if you're looking for something fluffy. Dostoyevsky or Joyce Carol Oates, it's not.The mystery was pretty easy to figure out and I didn't really mind all the name and label-dropping. The girls are pretty much self-absorbed, but I liked them.The book could have been titled ""Girls who remind you of Carrie, Miranda, Samantha and Charlotte do the Hamptons and solve a murder"".Chick Lit Lite.Enjoy!"
2,like reading a neiman marcus catalog,"I loved the first Molly Forrester, so I bought this one without a second thought. But I could barely get through a third of it. There is a huge amount of pretentious descriptions of everyone's designer clothing. Who cares? Not only that, but Molly herself could certainly not afford the stuff she wears on a reporter's salary (and frankly, I wouldn't respect her for wasting any money on it). I found the endless label-talk both distracting and pretentious. Beyond that, I thought the dialogue and relationships seemed very forced and awkward. With the weight of all this, the murder couldn't hold my interest."
3,Quite a bit charmless,"The first book in this series (Killer Heels) had charm and humor, this one didn't. EVERY character was wallowing in murky despair and the heroine came off as snarky and self-centered while she impeded the investigation. The story itself had short moments of interest, hence the 3 stars."
3,So-So,"I enjoyed the first book in this series, but this one disappointed me.For some reason, it just couldn't hold my interest for more than a few minutes at a time, and a book that would normally take me a day or two to read took nearly two weeks.I found Molly and her friends to be annoying and silly, and all the talk of designer labels got on my nerves after awhile. I also found it ridiculous that Kyle would put up with Molly, both her annoying ways and her insistence on continuing to stick her nose into the investigation.I honest can't say for sure if I'll read the next one. Chick lit should be fun...it shouldn't drag you down and make you feel like reading it is a chore."
5,Always a Good Read,This is the fourth edition of this well known series from Flying Magazine. Its as good now as it was when I started reading the ILAFFT articles in the magazine 30 years ago.
3,Fair DVD,This DVD has beautiful images of aspects of Trinidad and Tobago Carnival.I wish it explained the background and history more.
4,Interpersonal Conflict,"There are a host of books that cover this sort of subject. This one is a text book and is required for a course I am taking in Conflict Management and Resolution for my Master's Degree.Our professor has done me proud with choosing a book which is not sandpaper across my eyeballs. The book is very well written, easy to grasp and easy to work with - a blessing!If you find that this book is required for your class, fear not, make sure you have the correct edition, and enjoy!"
4,Very Insightful,I used this book for class and actually enjoyed the reading. Its written in a way that makes the subject easy to understand. And we all can use a better understanding of conflict resolution.Interpersonal Conflict
1,Don't waste your time,If you are looking for a original thought look elsewhere. This book is paragraph after paragraph or regurgitated quotes from other works.
1,Tell Me Something I Don't Know!,"This book is godawful. Your intelligence will be insulted. It consists of page after page of quotes from other books, most of which seem to be there just to fill pages to sell a book. If you need this book for a class, I recommend either locating it at a local library or getting the earlier edition, which has a nearly identical table of contents."
3,Only available for Kindle for PC!?!?!,"I was excited when I saw one of my textbooks for class available for my Kindle. Then after I purchased it I realized its only available for Kindle for PC. I cannot download it to my Kindle, I cannot read it on the Cloud, I cannot read it at work. I am NOT happy. If its for the Kindle why can't it be for ALL VERSIONS? Now my studies are limited to home."
2,A Mess,"This book is very poorly written. Somewhere below the run-on sentences and indecision about use of italics or boldface, there just might be some valuable information but you'll have to dig to find it. I suspect this book has been revised too many times and old information is getting mixed in with the new. I am disappointed that my teacher chose this book because I had been looking forward to the course. Now I'm just plodding through it with my eye on the finish line."
5,"Reviewed as ""flawless"" and ""the best on video"".","This is a classic workout from The Old Firm.These old Firm videos can't be beat.As far as I'm concerned the new firm workouts in no way conform to the scientifically and beautifully formulated original firm videos!I myself will only use the old firm videos and the new whfn videos produced by Anna BensonGet the real deal, don't be fooled by the look alikes!"
3,Well...... ho hum.....,"I was prepared to love this video. I am a regular ""Joyce Vedral"" user and I wanted some more variety. In this video, part of the time I couldn't figure out what part I was working, and another part of the time I was trying to keep up with complicated dance steps. Now and then the instructor would force out a smile, nothing genuine though. All so serious. I did feel that I got a good cardio workout, but not a very good weight training workout.I bet you may love this video if you are a dancer, or even sort-of a dancer, but I am clumsy and I will stick to Joyce!!"
5,"Slower workout, don't be deceived","This video ranks up there, as one of the Firm's toughest, right next to Body Sculpting Basics and Low Impact Aerobics. It works the lower body very well. I'm impressed that when you watch the video you don't think it's not that hard, until you do them. I've been using the Firm videos, exclusively, for four months. The progress that I've made by making healthy choices in eating (not feeling hungry) and working out, I haven't seen since my younger years. I've lost 5 dress sizes. This video will only enable me to achieve more results. This video is an excellent workout."
4,mozart in french-belgium style,"w. boeykens .... His music is very elegant & delicate. in this CD, also he transformed Mozart from vien to french-belgium style.... In Quintet, As 1st Movement introduction goes, we can feel various color in his breathing. he always plays music truly and thoroughly but he never loses an easy and composed attitude to musiche gives us a special experience which can't be given by german musician.....P.S I never mean his playing strange or non-traditional. he plays and follows very well in Mozart's style"
5,My Grandson Loved This Hat,My grandson just loved this hat. Others have noticed it when he wears it and it gets lots of compliments.
2,Don't fire your masseuse,"Consumer opinions will vary on an item such as this, but you should know the following before ordering:1. The ""massage"" comes from 2 buzzing vibrators implanted in the pad, each the size of a thick silver dollar. You're definitely conscious of these 2 isolated points and of trying to position at least one of them next to the body area to be treated.2. The power supply is fairly massive and heavy. No doubt it will cover up 3 outlets on your wall plate or power strip.3. The pad, like others I've tried, doesn't get very warm, thanks to a built-in safety regulator.4. The velcro straps might be useful if you're able to wear the pad; otherwise, they quickly get in the way. Also, the detachable electrical cord has a tendency to detach itself.5. The price is about half that of a single massage administered by a professional. Is it worth it? I'm beginning to think maybe not."
1,"Poor massager, poor value, returning it","The massage portion of this heating pad is no more a massager than the vibrate on a cell phone. There is only 1 heat setting, which is OK, but it's a bit hot for only one setting. It's like the High setting on my 3 setting hot pad."
1,"Nothing to it, poor excuse for a massager","I had a good massaging heating pad that was great, and I used it on my legs a lot., thought I could replace it. This one is not even in the ballpark. Absolutely useless, I have been had!"
2,"Marginal, Though Not Horrible","The reviewer who compared the massage feature to that of a cell phone perhaps said it best, so suffice it to say that one can essentially ignore that aspect of the unit [I might even liken the vibrations to those of an injured (and no longer airborne) housefly buzzing in circles]. With respect to the heat(ing), it does perform better, but is by no means stellar.The Pro's are its design for moisture, a better-than-average fabric/material - which holds its shape fairly well and the auto shut-off.The Con's include, as others have said, a HUGE AC-DC plug/power pack, no apparent ability to WASH the darn thing, only modest heat, annoying Velcro straps, a two-part power cord that not only must be taped to keep together, but can't be removed from the main pad for washing AND, perhaps most significantly, the fact that mine died after approx. 18 months (which, incidentally, raises yet another detractor; the Warranty is only a year, much less than many other brands)."
2,Mostly thumbs down for Conair Massaging Heating Pad,I bought this product for the massaging properties in conjuction with the heat. I thought it would help my restless leg styndrome. The vibration is too little. There are just a few little disks that create the massage. It is like someone else wrote just a little more than a cell phone vibration. It is not worth the purchase price. Buy a regular heating pad and a vibrating pillow instead!
2,too much trouble,"I am 6 months pregnant and my husband bought this for me because my feet have been hurting. I was so excited to use it. When I did use it I was very disappointed. First of all, the picture on the box does not show a cord to plug in the spa. To me, that is one major downfall. You have to be close enough to a plug in order to use it. Second, since I am pregnant it is very heavy carrying the spa from the sink to a plug. When I used it, it did make my feet feel good, but definiately not what I was expecting. It just wasn't worth the effort. My husband massages my feet and that feels 10 times better than this foot spa. Also, it did not keep my warm water warm. After about 10 min. I could feel the water was not as hot as it was when I put it in there. Overall, I would say to buy a different one or have your husband massage your feet."
5,flashing light to alert,"Although Latin American countries are very popular with bodyguards and official vehicles, which necessarily must sneak into the traffic, this light is recommended not only for times of emergencies, but also for use on roads with no lighting, as in the curves makes the role of prevention."
1,Never received,"For some reason Amazon never shipped the two items I bought, and for some reason I didn't even could make an A to Z guaranteed or something. I feel swindled..."
2,Measurements are difficult,"I found that the material cutting list was inconsistent with the measured drawings in the book. If you buy this book, be sure to make your own drawings and cutting measurements prior to cutting. It seems that the authors have not either tried to build from their plans or have not checked closely the measurements. The book has some very good projects...just be aware of this problem."
5,"Great book, however a costly error in some project specs","I purchased this book as a guide to building a version of a Stickley piece of furniture. I have found an error that quickly became very costly in the projects section on the book.The ""Morris Chair"" project materials list calls for lumber dimension of 37"" by 5"" by 1"" for the arms. Next, the text of the project specifies ""From the extra length of the arm provided by the oversize dimension given in the materials list, cut a piece 5 1/2"" in length.""Well, that is where the problem lies. The FINISHED arm should measure 37"" long. We just cut 5 1/2"" from that measure, leaving 31 1/2"" arm.The materials list should read : 42 1/2"" by 5"" by 1"" . At the prices for Quarter Sawn White Oak these days, you wont want to make the same mistake."
4,"Very good book, a little dated","Like other reviewers say this is a very good book. It is my favorite arts and crafts furniture projects books. The reproduction projects are beautiful. My copy is falling apart from frequent use in the workshop. It is a little dated, it mentions dowel but not biscuit joints and does not mention mortising machines. It may be a little much for new woodworkers but anybody with some experience in basic wood working should be able to handle this. It could do with better photographs of the reproduction pieces, expecially closeups of joinery detail (the photography in Building Arts & Crafts Furniture by Kemner for example is beautiful - a good book but not as good as this one).Just as a warning there actually are a few typos. For example in the bookcase the front bottom rail is listed in the parts list as 4 1/2"" wide, it's actually 5"" (the text does makes this clear)."
3,So many mistakes for such a good book,"This book is a wonderful ""picture book"", but you might want to seriously produce your own drawings and measurements before building the projects. I have been building the end table/bookcase and have encountered so many errors, some of the critical, that I have given up using the book's drawings. Other than its EXPENSIVE inaccuracies, I love the book, but would caution everyone to thoroughly check the drawings before cutting any wood."
5,A great start to anyone wanting to discover monk's music,"This incredibly sharp-sounding recording is a must for anyone wanting to dive into Monk's universe. Not only a collection of almost every well-knowned Monk's compositions, this recording feature some of the most exciting interpretations of his classics (Misterioso for example is re-invented with a New Orleans feeling that is irresistible. ) Certainly one of the best reedition of 1998. A true classic."
5,best hand held cd player,"First and only one I ever had, awesome little machine, regged with great sound minimal skip."
4,SANTANA'S BEST,"The last album featuring the original Woodstock lineup w/ Greg Rollie is probably their overall best record. It's also one of the most energetic, good time party/beach albums you can buy. It's wall to wall solid except for the 3 bonus live tracks on the remastered version which are pretty shakey. But if Supernatural is your only cd of his and you dig it, get III and listen to a good Santana album."
4,Much better than Supernatural!,This is the good Santana music I wanna hear! Not that trashy Supernatural album!
3,NOT AS GOOD AS EXPECTED!,"GREAT GUITAR PERFORMANCE BUT VERY BAD IN RECORDING, WHEN YOU PLAY IT IN GOOD HI-FI SYSTEM, YOU FEEL THIS CD VERY NOISILY & ALL THE INSTRUMENTS MIXING TOGETHER. IT ALSO HAPPENED ON SUPERNATURE. LOTUS'S RECORDING IS A LITTLE BETTER, BUT, HOWEVER, IT CLEAR IN ONLY MIDDLE RANGE BUT NOT MUCH BASS LEFT. A LITTLE DISAPPOINTMENT!"
5,Nice compilation,I really like these Legacy packages. They do it right. Bonus tracks along with live shows. I'd recommend that everyone check out Sony Legacy for their favorite titles.
5,Just Smokin',"Based upon the liner notes from the Best of Santana, Carlos was dissappointed with the recording of this record. Totally mind-boggling. This CD is just loaded with memorable moments. Even the song-writing was improving. Both Everything Is Comming Our Way and Taboo feature some subtle hooks and soulful vocals from Greg Rollie. Not too mention some smokin' guitar solos from Carlos and Neal Schon. And what about the wah wah infected solo on Everybody's Everything? Definitely one of my all time favorite guitar solos. Tower of Power contributes nicely here as well. Guajrina offers a nice divergence from the usual heavy handed stylings. Gotta love the trumpet solo. Heck almost everything on here is spectacular. Some may get a little tired of the excessive percussion beats. Those who don't care for excessive isntrumentals may pass as well. However, this is Santana at its best and I would certainly rate this at least on the level of Abraxas if not slightly better."
5,This is true Santana.,"For those of you who listened to ""Shaman"" and threw it away either have this album or have heard all the songs on it. This is the Santana that we all know and love. The best of all of Santana's releases (there are some good ones too)and probably the most energetic. I could listen to this album a thousand times and not tire of it. It is Santana in top form.DIG IT!!!"
1,Don't Buy This Book!,"Don't buy this book! If you're seriously looking at being able to find out about all of the registry line items available in Windows 2000 this isn't the book. The book is rated intermidiate to advanced. What?!?! It's a beginners book. I expect a book that is advertised at such levels to be like ""Windows NT 4.0 Registery: A Professional Reference"". Now that's a registry book!"
5,"The REAL West - real environmentalism, real culture","In High Country News, you'll read what's happening from grassroots enviro groups, not just Sierra, Wilderness Club, etc. That said, you'll get full and unbiased reporting of all sides of an issue, such as its cover story on the northern spotted owl early this fall.And, it's not just environmental news.For instance, I'll bet you didn't know thast Espanola, N.M. and not NYC or LA, is the per-capital heroin death capital of the world.You would if you read High Country News.Throw in its take on Western politics, such as being the first magazine of note to report on the LDS's funding of California's Prop. 8, and you have a most-0read for anybody who lives in or vacations in the West."
5,A Good Blueprint For Purity,"This is one of the more inspired books that I have read. As is often said, it is academic to ascertain whether these are the true words of Jesus. What is salient is that one listens to the spirit speak inside you to determine the value of the words.This book is very short. In short, the book outlines the importance of diet, fasting, and practices that will invite purity into the body. What is more important than these simple mechanics - however - is the greater idea that you cannot defile the one place that houses a direct communication with God - your body. To paraphrase: if you eat of death, you inherit death.Excellent and inspiring."
5,TRUTH SPEAKS!!,"THIS BOOK IS ABOUT CLEANSING ON EVERY LEVEL. WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IN JESUS OR NOT IS REALLY NOT THE ISSUE. THE TEACHINGS IN THIS BOOK IS ABOUT SELF HEALING ON EVERY LEVEL, PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, MENTAL AND SPIRITUAL. IT IS ABOUT FASTING AND CLEANSING AND THE SPIRITUAL REASONS BEHIND IT. A VERY SACRED TEXT OF THE HIGHEST ORDER. A MUST READ FOR ANYONE SEARCHING TO CLEANSE AND BE REBORN. TRULY FOR THE LIFE AND THE LIVING!!"
3,An Example of Modern Apocrypha,"This is an example of modern apocrypha/pseudepigrapha. Those who enjoy Szekely's ""translations"" may be interested in the earlier ""The Gospel of the Holy Twelve"" by Rev. Gideon Jasper Richard Ouseley and ""The Life of Saint Issa"" by Nicholas Notovitch. Both of these texts were supposedly discovered in Tibet in the late 19th century and are examples of the ""Jesus in India"" literature, as is ""The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ"" which was channeled by Levi H. Dowling early in the 20th century. These texts are widely available online and from Amazon."
3,Interesting,"While the text is interesting, there were NO references to Jesus among any of the Dead Sea Scrolls. So if this is a true ancient writing, then it didn't come from the Dead Sea Scrolls. Where did it come from? I am far more inclined to think this is a 4th or 5th century gnostic text..."
2,Impossible feet,"Should have paid extra for one that came with the little feet attached. They don't seem like a neccessity but using a glass desk, I fear that it will be scratched. Considering returning this after asking many hulking men to help attach the feet and only one little foot has latched on."
1,Great--until it broke in the second week,"This Learning Resource phone did in fact help my daughter learn our telephone number (helped by a incentive of a trip for ice cream when she did it)----and quite satisfactorily allowed a personalized recording of our voices to be waiting for her when she successfully dialed it (just the 7 digits---no area code).I was looking forward to her playing with it for years---and then it broke. The entire middle row of numbers stopped ""beeping"" when pressed. I too, fancy myself as someone who can take apart and put things together---unscrewed the back and when I got it off, found the densely soldered network around the keypad unfixable (by me, anyway).So, for the two weeks it worked, great!And then it broke.Rather disappointing overall."
1,disappointed,"I bought this for my son for Christmas, as he requested a toy telephone and I thought it would be beneficial for him to start learning how to call his own phone number and 911. First of all, it is difficult to program phone numbers into speed dial. The pamphlet tells you how but of course that was lost rather quickly. Second, within a few hours of my son receiving this toy, the sound stopped working. Changing the batteries did not help. Luckily my husband is pretty adept at taking things apart and fixing them, but it's safe to say that every other time my son takes this toy out to play with it, the sound is not working, and he has to wait for his dad to take it apart and reconnect some wires. I would not recommend this product. Definitely not worth the $$."
1,Not working. Needs to return it,"The toy is not working. Only the green on/off light is on, occasional beep, totally silent otherwise, no display. I changed the batteries to no effect.Now I need to return it. Very disappointed. Will see how amazon customer service deal with this and write a final review."
5,A Special Toy For A Special Boy!,"My son has autism, so I am constantly on the lookout for toys that will help him in everyday task. The phone is FANTASTIC! In only two day, he got the hang of the phone and learned his home phone number! The kicker was for praise, he heard mommy's voice saying, he got it right! No mechanical, strange voices! Good Job! Great Product!"
5,Great toy for all ages,"I bought this phone for my son when he turned 1, he is now 5 and he still loves this toy. My husband is in the Navy, so when he would be deployed we recorded hisvoice so my son could hear it. I now have a 1 year old daughter who also enjoys the toy. My son now records his voice on it to make his sister laugh. It was one of my best toy purchases."
2,Dont Lose Your Money: This is not an Honest Hit Repackage,"Why does American Sony repackage the same songs with different covers and offer some few tracks to attract buyers? I do not take it as honest as a market strategy should be. Browse back to Mathis originals and buy other CDs: ""Johnny Greatest Hits"", ""Johnny"" are good bets."
4,Master of the Ballad,Very few singers can handle a ballad better than Johnny Mathis which is living proof on this cd. His vocals are crystal clear and the whole recording is squeeky clean. He does my favourite vocal on 'Misty' included here. Very few singers can do justice to 'Stardust' because it's a very difficult piece to sing however Johnny makes the song his own. His hits are mostly included in this set. You might like to give your subwoofer a boost upwards for the first half of this cd. The only flaw is the live selection which ends the cd. I personally don't care for a mixture of studio and live.
4,great but not ultimately great!,"This is very good compilation of Johnny Mathis finest songs.. It would be better if the Live Version is replaced by the Studio Version.. Also, this compilation should included Gina. So, this album is great but not ultimately great.."
4,A Great Collection,Johnny Mathis has such a great voice and command of it as an instuement. If you want a great collection of Songs by this artist I would say this is it.
5,How ultimate is ultimate ?,"In the accompanying text to the album it is already acknowledged: How can you pick songs for an ultimate album from someone who is more than 40 years around and still making music ? I think that they made a good choice of Mathis performances on this cd. Take your love in your arms, take a sip of wine and listen to Johnny Mathis !"
1,Same Old Songs,I have been looking for a Johnny Mathis CD with these songs : Take Good Care Of Her ; I'm Stone In Love With You ; Gina These 3 songs are his big hits. How can you have an ultimate hits collection without them?
4,Not bad for the money.,"I picked this radio up sans the side speaker for $10. I took it out of the package in the store and plugged it in, and it sold itself. I had been looking at Tivolis and the superb Boston Acoustics table radio, but did not want to shell out the clams.Pros:1. The speaker is loud and clear.2. I like the lighted dial.3. Reception can be pretty good.Cons:1. Am/Fm dial is screwy (will sometimes mix Am and Fm bands simultaniously) I just turned it back and forth and it fixed itself.2. Reception can be pretty bad, depending on the station and will mix frequencies.3. Antenna is a sorry little wire. I may get into the guts and resolder a better antenna in place.Can't be beat for $10 bones."
2,Excellent sound but faulty band selector,"We purchased this radio for my mother-in-law a while back now.The dial is lighted for easy tuning and the dial itself has a little resistance so when you find your station, you do not slip past it. Smart & Easy!More importantly, the sound quality is very good indeed.Problem: the selector switch has failed. When you switch to AM, it stays on the FM station that was playing beforehand..Wiggle and jiggle it, and the AM might come on.We bought another radio for my mother-in-law, and I now use this in the garage.It does have a very rich stereo sound - just can't get AM."
3,"Nice, but no Tivoli","Overall, I am pleased with the purchase, but this radio does not compete with a Tivoli. I compaired this radio directly to my Tivoli Model Two, and found the following:<br /><br />(1) The Model Two has clearer, richer, warmer sound,<br />(2) The Model Two tuner section is much, much better,<br />(3) The feel and finish is much better on the Tivoli.<br /><br />However, for 30 bucks, it really isn't fair to do a direct comparision. The Emerson Simplicity is a classy looking unit that does perform nicely. For low level background music, it delivers nice sound - much better than about 99% of the other stuff out there. If you want nice sound, and elegant styling at a budget price, spring for one of these."
2,Emerson Simplicity am/fm with companion speaker,I made an error in buying this item and I immediately returned it. I wished a small table radio and the extra speaker would have required much more space than was available for its use.I returned it and got full credit by refusing delivery.
5,These things are awesome!,I use them for my tv speakers and they are great for the price!Nice and compact and great sound. Very impressive.
5,I love this radio,"perfect. exactly what I was looking for. looks cool like an older radio, but functions perfectly and easily like a nice modern radio. sounds great. I can't believe anyone would spend more money on a ""better"" brand. I am very, very happy with my purchase."
2,My Christmas By Andrea Bocelli,The video and audio quality is not really good compare to most DVD should be. Feels like cheap production or those bought in pirated store quality.
5,Andrea Bocelli,Excellent delivery time. I purchased this CD to replace the one that I lost - could not go through a Christmas Season without it. What else can you say - Andrea Bocelli is the best!
3,My Christmas DVD,Great Christmas show but the DVD was only so-so because it was not recorded in Dolby 5.1.Disappointing.
4,What A Voice!!!!,I saw this show 2 years ago on PBS and thought it was great and we bought the CD. This year we wanted to buy the DVD because it would not have all the PBS commercials for contributions and we wanted it for future Christmas' as there is a lack of good Christmas shows. I would have given it 5 stars except I don't care for one of the guest's singing.
5,Great,Need a HD version!!!! I sometimes see the PBS show on HD and it drives me nuts watching this DVD. Yuck but I just have to suffer a bit.
2,"My Christmas, Andrea Bochelli & David Foster","I was not as impressed with this one. I think it was the Christmas songs that I was not used to hearing from Andrea. The children singing was different, nice ~ but not what I was thinking. A lot of stage changes throughout that were kind of nice but just not real life feel, had more of a ""staged"", if you will, feel . This video did not capture me like his others. If you really want an awesome video of Andrea I suggest ""Under The Tuscan Sun"" filmed in Tuscany. Kenny G, Chris Botti, Ling Ling, and many more very tanlented artist. The scenery is gorgeous the acoustics and stage are quite nice. Very Well done!"
5,Great story,"If possible would have given more than five stars - I am a patriotic American, and thought this story excellent. There are some wonderful people in this world."
1,arrrgh!!!,"One of the few books I could not get past the first few chapters! Although, you'd probably enjoy this book if you are a Right Wing, Fundamentalist Christian, NRA Gun Nut!"
5,Another great book by author Skip Coryell,"Skip Coryell is an excellent writer -- I've read several of his books, so far. Definitely a must-read for those who love history, and who believe in our U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights!"
1,Truly awful.,It seemed an interesting plot but I only made it through the first few chapters before I couldn't read any more. The characters weren't believable in thought or speech. The descriptions of events didn't pull the reader in but left me wondering why the author used a particular phrase. It's like watching a play with really bad actors.
1,Negative is easier to believe!,As far as a book goes and you like to read...go for it. The story is interesting and well laid out but I did find if I put the book down and went back to it I had a ...okay now I remember. (notice I didn't say it was a page turner that couldn't be put down)This book appears to be pushing a belief system... not sure which one since the author did research for both sides.There lies the problem.... I did not enjoy this book.
2,Not worth my valuable reading time.,"The underlying premise of this story had potential, but this was a very poorly written book. This felt like a first draft of a manuscript or an outline for a made-for-tv movie. The dialogue of the characters was a quirky stream of consciousness. You were subjected to the internal thoughts of the characters in place of true character development, and their thoughts were immature and boring. The book moved very slowly. Even when this book was going nowhere, I wanted to give it a chance so I didn't stop reading, hoping that it would redeem itself - it didn't. It is a travisty to give this book 4 stars, let alone 5. I highly value my reading time, and this was truly a waste. I wish I had spent my time on almost anything else."
5,right thing for the job,"we had a grout (ironically made by the same company) for our slate kitchen tiles which refused to dry with a uniform color even after thorough mixing. Originally we thought this was because of bad installers, but after digging out the original grout and grouting our tiles again- it dried with all different shades of grey! Then I found out about grout stain- bought this product from amazon - and it works perfectly! It colored and sealed to uniform perfection. We meticulously painted the grout with small brushes, were careful to immediately wipe up the tile edges that got any stain on them, and now everything looks perfect."
4,Did the job!,It did the job. Painted our grout lines with an old tooth brush & it worked great. Have some left over.
1,Lousy product,Thin reverberant sound. On the first 12 tracks (Berrys) all the information comes out of the right channel only. Totally annoying.The separate CD editions of Berrys and Jukebox Hits are probably the ones to go for.
3,Naval Historical Fiction,"Although enjoyable, I found this somewhat less plausible that most of the genera of this period. I thought the ending was much weaker than the overall story and detracted from the fabric of the tale."
2,slow read kept falling asleep reading it,A very tedious and somewhat boring read. I'm sorry I purchased it and would not consider other books by this author.
2,Not even close,"Winston is compared favorably to Patrick O'Brian. Not even close. Characterization is shallow and the reader is told their personality rather than shown. The plot has possibilities, but I was brought up short by the Randolph passing Sable Island and the Captain opening his orders to discover he wasn't ordered to join the Chesapeake squadron. Maybe I missed something. I don't think so. I may spend the winter rereading Forester or O'Brian."
5,Saved me a lot of work,"I am a 3rd year student taking a data structures course. We are allowed to program in any language we wish, so I chose C++. The professor gave us several projects during the current semester. I chose one on sorting. I was at the book store and saw this book on C++ and STL. There were some way cool examples on regular C++ coding and then the same stuff with STL. I bought the book.When I really got into this, I learned a lot about the STL and included some of this stuff in my projects. I showed my professor the book. He was impressed (not just with the book but because I went out and bought an additional book for the class). Anyway - no one else did anything with the STL. Some dudes wrote C code (yeah - no joke) and one did a Java project (ugh). I got the A.If I ever meet Murray and Pappas I owe them a drink."
3,All About Eve Blu-ray Book,i love this movie and i love cheap prices :)transfer movie 4/5 great but to soft i thinkAudio DTS HD 5.1 3.5/5 averageFeature 3.5/5 in standart definitioni know different 20th Century in book edition .. very less for book edition than Warner Bross but it's okey if prices is right ( cheap )
5,"Margo, the Cat","I hope to get another cat so I can call her Margo, after Margo Channing, the protagonist of the film. This is a classic (hold onto your seat belts, it's gonna be a bumpy ride). I consider this Bette Davis's finest role."
5,It deserves its reputation.,"This film has a legendary reputation and it certainly lives up to it. All the catfights, the backstabbing, the blackmailing... What an exhilirating film! The cast is beyond superb and the ending is eerie, but sublime. Those heavenly voice-overs keep changing the point of view, but it is always done so perfectly. It is truly a cinematic masterpiece that hasn't aged a bit and still revels in all its glory. There's a reason why that ""bumpy night"" is still being talked about."
5,Brilliant backstage backstabbing drama...,"One night after a theater performance Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) is awaiting to see her idol, Margo Channing (Bette Davis), leave the theater, but to Eve's astonishment she is invited to Margo's lodge by Margo's best friend Karen Richards (Celeste Holm). This leads to an invitation to become Margo's assistant which Eve gracefully accepts as it becomes her dream to work for Margo. However, Eve appears to be too good to be true as Margo becomes irritated by Eve's constant goodwill and care. It turn out that Eve has her own agenda, which she seeks to achieve with relentless dedication. All About Eve offers a brilliant cinematic experience and its six Oscars including one for best film in 1951 displays the type of cinematic quality that the audience is to witness as they view this brilliant film."
4,Old is often better than New!!!,"I loved this movie,and would recommend it to anyone interested in old films. Although I am twenty, I love the old actresses and this film is one of my favorites. I believe that the character Margo Channing, captures much of the real Bette Davis. What else can I say, try this old movie it truly is a classic."
5,Great Film Even Better,"This is probably the best film ever made and in Blu-ray it's even better.This film should be the benchmark all films are judged by.The book is just pure gravy. Awesome idea putting it in ""book"" form."
5,Davis and Baxter are great...,"Davis is entertaining just to watch. What a crafty actress.Baxter implores you to dislike her.Holm is just beyond reach.All in all, this well written film is just off the campy scale. Davis appears too old for her beaus in this film. A more mature male cast would have fixed this problem.The direction just isn't necessary. The female cast could direct their own performances, and I think they do - truth be told. BUY this film. A true repeat must."
4,All Time Classic,"20th Century Fox is one of the best film studios to preserve its old films. Their film archives are extensive, and well known for the outtakes, bloopers and trailers that are frequently used in documentaries and cable TV.The DVD version of ""All About Eve"" does not have any outtakes or bloopers, but is still rich in other surplus materials. The DVD has an audio commentary from Celeste Holm, one of the actresses in the film. There are also 3 different coming attraction trailers, as well as a few Fox Movietone Newsreels or raw footage from the Movietone newsreel archive of award ceremonies related to the film."
5,Recemmended purchase,The dvd is in excellent condition. Fast delivery. Very excited about this purchase. Thanks for the great service.
5,Incredible Writing Perfectly Executed,"Mankiewicz was an incredible writer - The Barefoot Contessa, A Letter To Three Wives, The Quiet American. This screenplay has to be one of the most clever, barbed, and literate of the mid-century, if not the 20th Century. Bette Davis alternates between subtlety and scenery chewing in a way that is perfect for the character; Gary Merrill is a near-perfect foil. Thelma Ritter plays off Davis like the seasoned pro she would become. George Sanders is delicious (as ever)as the classy, superior, cobra-like critic. Anne Baxter is too good to be true. Underplayed and often overlooked, however, are Hugh Marlowe and Celeste Holm, as Davis' best friends. Marlowe is appropriately naive, but Ms. Holm is brilliant, as the well-heeled, Vassar grad who is far from the simple ""happy housewife"" she seems. Their normalcy seems to bouy the volatile personalities that surround them - and watch out when they fade to the background."
5,Classic Movie,"Considered by some to be one of the most literate movies ever made. It certainly contains some of the best acting ever done on film. Everyone does a wonderful job - especially Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, & George Sanders. Marilyn Monroe has a small part & is lovely in it. If you want to see a great vintage classic film with wonderful acting pyrotechnics get this one. The bonus material always gives added incite. A must have."
3,Great film but nothing special about the Blu-ray version,"The movie is 5 star, but the video quality is no better than what you would see with a standard DVD. Also, it is not widescreen, it is sort of halfway between fullscreen and widescreen. I doubt the original film had that aspect ratio. Book with pictures was nice."
5,a must have edition of a clasic movie,Tha masterpieces of cinema deserves editions like this. Great Quality in Video and Audio with a 1080p HD amazing and one classic film that is a pleasure to watch and revisit from time to timeBuy it and you won't regret
2,A Disappointment,"I had looked forward to this film for months and months and then decided to watch it. First of all, I feel that Ann Baxter was all wrong playing Eve. Ann Blythe would have been a much better pick. Davis was wonderful as always and that part, her acting, was a pleasure to watch. I don't know. I just expected the movie to be better and for the life of me can't figure out why it won awards. Maybe the films in 1950 were all poor quality and this was the best one. Or perhaps, it was because of Bette Davis. I know the reviews here are high, but I expected more and the fact that Ann Baxter was so wrong for playing Eve made it the disappointment it was for me. What were the producers thinking? Oh well . . . Just my experience with it."
3,Could of been better,"Much of the editors from way back then seem to keep it kind of boring. Only real spots seems to be at the Airport, fan waiting in alley. Movie dragged on. Thought their be makeovers, more training to be a star. But no, only be a fan/friend and then steal away your best friend to get into show business. It was like on purpost not enough gas got into the tank, just to hold up the main star from acting that night. Gave the newcomer plenty of time to be the understudy. Like I said slow moving movie. Should be remade better."
1,All About Eve...DVD failed!,"We watched this movie for the first time since our purchase arrived...and the DVD failed during the last 15 minutes of the video...tried cleaning it...et cetera...but nothing worked...can it be exchanged for one that works as it is a part of my ""best picture"" Academy Award movies I am purchasing through Amazon?Regards,Phil Embrey"
5,Bette Davis Eyes,"If you like black and white movies, this is definetly one of the greats, and to me Bette Davis best movie. She plays alpha female, as everyone else around her plays second to her success. One of her admirers,her assistant, who is devoted to her later edges her out of the spotlight, by becoming her. But of course Bette Davis is still the victor, even if she dosent get the trophy at the end of the night."
5,Classic Movie - A must see for Bette Davis fans.,"I've seen this movie too many times to count and never tire of watching this truly classic Bette Davis performance. Excellent performances by a great ensemble cast, including a very young Marilyn Monroe, playing to type, but very effective. This movie is made for rainy days and Sundays when you don't want to watch football or golf."
4,Bette Davis Shines,"This is Bette Davis in top form, glamorous, somewhat vixenish, somewhat a victim, everything needed for a great performance. Marilyn Monroe has a small role, but stands out during her scenes, as well, even when she is not speaking. Ann Baxter is also wonderful as the scheming Eve. Check it out, you could be pleasantly surprised."
5,ALL ABOUT EVE!,"If you have never seen ""All About Eve,"" then you are missing a true Hollywood classic! The Eve of the title is Eve Harrington, played by Anne Baxter, but it is Bette Davis as Margo Channing who you are going to remember the most! Margo is an aging star and Eve is her protege, who is really a coniving back-stabbing little, well, you know! Devastating on target look at the Broadway theater scene! George Sanders, Celeste Holm and Gary Merrill shine in the first-rate cast! Marilyn Monroe is also in this one, but you hardly notice as you watch Eve claw her way to the top over Margo's still warm body! We were all reminded of this great 1950 film directed by Joseph Mankiewicz when ""Titanic"" got all those Oscar nominations! But whatever prompts you to check this one out, just do it!"
5,"Addison DeWitt: ""You're too short for that!'","The above line, spoken by George Sanders' DeWitt, is just one of the many that populate the most enjoyable listening experience ever done for film. Amazon has a quote page that just hits at the surface of the abundance that are true gems. ""Eve"" is the only American film that works so well as an audio presentation because of the snappy dialogue and magnificent delivery from all its participants.Everyone raves about Davis, Baxter, Sanders, Holm, Ritter, and a then-unknown Monroe; but one cannot deny that this film was the apex for Gary Merrill and Hugh Marlowe. The two actors would never appear in a film of such greatness again.Where is a Joseph Mankiewicz today when you need one?"
5,all about eve,'all about eve' is simply one of the best films ever. terrific acting by everyone. my favorite bette davis role and that's saying a lot.
1,Samsung Dead Pixels,"I have just purchased a 191T+ monitor (which looks great, by the way) - and I could not open the box in the store. When I unpacked it and turned it on, it had a RED dead pixel - which for CAD (that's my bread) is extremely annoying (black/dark backgroung is the norm). Their (Samsung's) policy is 10 dead pixels for an exchange! Stay away from Samsung products - their quality is not what they claim. Check the review on Tom's Hardware - I should have listened to them.FN, Ontario"
1,Poor quality,"Very poor quality. The vhs tape must have been a bootleg copy. Sound very poor, picture quality very poor. The cover for the vhs container looked like a xerox copy, not something orginal. Displeased with purchase. It is a great movie."
4,"BASIL DEARDEN, OPUS 33","Another very good Basil Dearden movie of the 60's. If you don't know Gina Lollobrigida, this crime story will make you understand why she was considered as Sophia Loren's challenger in terms of Italian sex-appeal. Ralph Richardson is despicable as an infirm millionaire and Sean Connery shot the film between two James Bonds. Highly recommended."
3,"I'm not sure the selections are the group's best, but fairly extensive coverage of timeframe","This is a utility CD for me. I wanted several of the biggies from my old tapes as well as ""Europa"" and some of the more obscure material. I'm content with the CD, but I'm not entirely sure I would call it the best."
2,THE BEST AND THE WORST OF SANTANA,"WHILE THE CD CONTAINED SOME OF THE BEST INSTRUMENTALS OF SANTANA, IT ALSO CONTAINED SOME OF THE WORST AND LEAST KNOWN WORKS AS WELL. I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT THE PRODUCER WAS THINKING. THE ""BEST OF"" IMPLIES AND SHOULD MEAN THE BEST. NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE THAT TRACKS 8-12 REPRESENT SANTANA'S BEST. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE CLASSIC ALBUMS INSTEAD."
4,You won't be wasting your money on this!!!,This is one of the best compilation of Santana's work over the years. It's a good mix Latin Jazz and Blues. It's a good start if you want to listen more about Latin Jazz. Every track is enjoyable!
2,Definitely Not the Best Of,"I have to agree with the negative reviews. It has some good songs, but it is not the best of. You only have to go to your local used CD store to confirm your suspicions. There's always a copy of this CD around."
2,Good tracks but terrible remixing!,"This cd represents some of Santana's finest songs, however, the guys who did the remastering/remixing should be fired! they cranked up the bass on every song and left almost no treble or any midrange at all, every song sounds muddy and flat as if you had placed a cardboard box between your ear and the speakers. If you're a new Santana fan do yourself a favour and just buy some of the original albums these tracks are from, in fact most of these tracks are on the 1995 box set called ""Dance of the Rainbow Serpent"", so spend a few more bucks and get that, then you'll only need about three or four other cd's to get the rest of the tracks from their original albums, all of which have better sound than this best of cd."
5,Awesome Greatest Hits Collection,On this collection all of the popular and most remember Santana songs are assembled together in an album which despite its small amount of tracks does a very good job at collecting the hits and famous concert songs from Santana. This is a perfect collection for a Santana novice looking to check out the sweet sound of Santana.
3,A fair compilation but not extensive,"So, you enjoyed Supernatural, and now want to hear more? This is a good starting point but my preference is for the more extensive compilation titled ""The Very Best of Santana"" which can be purchased usually at mid price. It includes a track from nearly every album whereas this compilation skims over selected albums. The 1979 hit ""You Know that I love you"" is a brilliant song and should have been included on this - but you'll find it on the ""Very Best of"". Santana had a brief comeback in 1985 with a song ""Say it Again"" which isn't their most fantastic song but you'll also find it on the ""Very Best of"". This latest compilation will give anyone new to Santana an idea of why they were so good all those years ago, but my recommendation is to buy the ""Very Best of"" from CBS which came out in 1991."
5,latin rock delivers,"carlos santana is the king of latin rock and has been for 40 years now and this is his best,leaning heavely on his early years (as it should) you get all his best tracks from black magic woman to the searing souls sacrifice. this is great rock from start to finish,it does have a few great tracks missing like Toussaint L'Overture and Guajira but these can be found on vol 2. so if your looking for some santana this is what your looking for.highly reccomended"
4,Phishman,This is a good albulm which i receved as a gift but i was disappointed in some of the songs becuse the sound quality is not so good.But there is alot of great songs and i would recomend buying this albulm.
3,What kind of PREJUDICE is this?,"Got the cd and immediately (as I often do) open to read credits first. Was intrigued to ""get some learning"" on the 16 versions of Santana. Of course, I noticed several names that I knew from other acts. but then WOW! It mentions key/vox Leon Patillo as ""vanished""? What? Perhaps became for awhile ""THE MAN"" in another genre (so the speak). Perhaps 2 of the most romantic songs ever written/recorded/covered/sang at weddings he is resposible for -""Flesh of My Flesh"" and ""Security"". But there are soooooo many others.The Definitive Collection"
1,An uneven and underated collection of Santana's hits!,"I believe they should have added four songs on 'The Best of' from previous Santana albums like ""Hope Your Feeling Better"", ""Everything's Coming Our Way"", ""Se A Cabo"" & ""Persuasion"". That should had been more expanded to a more wide range by 20 track cuts on this so-called anthology compilation. How dare they Columbia/Legacy records 30th anniversary do such a thing missing out on some good rock music montage classics left out into bands recent catalogue vault. I would'nt spend my money's worth to get a CD just like this one here forget it!"
3,Preview Looks great,The Preview of this book reads really well and the book seems quite interesting. I'll never read the whole book though because $50 for an electronic book is way too expensive. When cost to produce gets higher they pass the cost on to us. When cost to produce gets lower they charge the same and pocket the difference!
1,No Vibes Here,This product is not worth the money. I looks hot but does really nothing. Has no vibrating contol and almost no vibe at all. Nice color is all I can say about it. I would return this product if there was a way to do it. It was a real disappointment. This was our first purchase of sex toys. It had no reviews when we were shopping. That should have been my first clue. It is very boring and we tried to use it in a variety of ways and even replaced the battery. SAVE YOUR MONEY. It was expensive too!
3,Music = 4! Sound =1,"After many years of knowing the name, but never acknowledging her music, I finally bough this three CD set. The memories it invokes are truly delightful. Listening, on the other hand, is miserable. I know this stuff is old, but come on, is sounds like this was recorded in a shoebox. I'm not sure if any of this has been remastered ( I assume the 1999 Tapestry was???), but I was expecting a ""nice"" deep acoustic soundstage. The sound is very flat, compressed and just dull."
1,There's Something Wrong With You If You Like This,"I just don't get Carole King. Now I know why James Taylor dumped her. What is she trying to do? Hey Carole -- don't let the melody get in the way. At least she had her daughter with her in the Gap commercial. If you want a really good CD, pick up Carly Simon's ""Secrets"" or ""Boys in the Trees."""
5,RuffDawg - K9 Flyer,"This is the best frisbee I have been able to find for my 18 month old Golden Retriever who either tears or chews everything else up. Our first one for him lasted a whole year, and he rough houses with it daily. Its even light enough that we can skim it across the floor in the house and it won't break anything it bumps. Every dog should have this!!"
2,GRAINY,"I love my vaio laptop, but this cam is horrible. It is very grainy in any light condition. I am going to return this one."
1,don't waste your money,"i bought this web cam new in 2003. used it for about 2 years and really liked it, but then it stopped working altogether. i like to keep my electronics for several years and replace them only when technology improves - not in order to replace faulty or broken equipment. this webcam has consistently been poorly reviewed in most every article i've seen on it since it failed. it's overpriced, and the risk of it shorting out is just too great for me to consider replacing it with another vaio cam. my advice is while this cam may look cool and is very low profile, stick to the more traditional cams and you will be very satisfied. sorry, sony."
4,Great old school funky latin jazz,Throughout George Dukes career when it comes to laying down some funky latin jazz sounds he has been steady and and one of best this disc is full of those funky latin grooves original stuff with his signiture sound. Keep it coming George because I'm listining for it.
1,"Horrible, completely unlikeable characters","I was left feeling like Max was an abusive man, and Claire was a submissive woman being badgered and emotionally battered into submission. The author never bothered to make Max an actual human being. He never says he's sorry, just expects everyone to bow down to his self proclaimed ""superior intellect"". What a waste of time. There are so many other authors out there who could have made this storyline work with characters who were human and fallible, but this one failed miserably."
1,AWFUL!!,What an awful book! Romantic Suspense? I think not! Thank goodness I didn't pay for this. I wish I could give it a 0 star1 No redeeming qualities in the characters. The story was so drawn out. Pages and pages of useless dialogue and information. I think I skimmed through the entire book - a first for me!
2,It's not up to Linda Howard's recent quality.,"I love Linda Howard's books, especially After The Night and Dream Man, but this one is not as good as her other books. Granted it's good enough for a pasttime reading, but if you really mean to enjoy Linda Howard's you'll be disappointed. I wonder why LH made Claire so weak and dependent to Max. What ever happen to the strong female character? Is Claire supposed to be happy with Max rearranging her life to his mean without having her say over the matter? To me, Max Conroy is too dominant and Claire is too meek and agreeable, there is not enough give and take in this love story."
3,Good writing not so good story,"I like Linda Howards writing and this book clearly has her style imprinted on it. Character development is great with the shy introverted Claire and the smooth skilled Max but something breaks down in the story after Max uses Claire and disappears for several weeks. Not only is this not very plausible but when they do get back together he becomes controlling and she falls in line following along willingly. He doesn't have a girlfriend anymore, she becomes his pet dog."
2,Not up to standard,"I've read all of Linda Howard's books, and usually enjoy them very much. This is one of her earlier efforts and she certainly has improved. The thing that bothered me most about this book is why Clair, who seems like a relatively smart person, if a bit insecure, would trust or take back a man who screwed her over so completely. Beside tha plot points, Howard's dialogue is much better now, and she seems to be writing stonger female characters, which I personally prefer. Not a bad book, but see if you can get it from the library before you spend the money."
2,Stiff and uncomfortable,"There are sections of ""Almost Forever"" that show Howard developing her ability to get inside her characters, to convey passion and deep emotion with believable urgency. Unfortunately, there are also very uncomfortable sections that show her later adoption of unpleasant themes (which sadly define her work today): an abusive alpha man, a woman who we are told is internally strong but who behaves in passive and utterly unbelievable ways. Claire is betrayed by Max emotionally and professionally and yet this woman leaves her home to follow him across the state, allowing him back into her life without a whimper. Max, on the other hand, bullies and pushes, lacking sensitivity or subtlety, yet is supposed to be irresistable.This book, written early in her career, is worth reading but not worth spending money on. Wait for the library copy, or pick it up second hand."
5,A great little romance.,"I have always loved English guys and Max Conroy is no different, real or not. I loved this love story. Linda Howard knows romance."
3,Ok Book,"I liked this book, but I did not think that it was anything great. Max was a little sure of himself throughout the whole book. I thought that Claire was a little too needy. She just ups and accepts everything that Max did to her too quickly. There wasn't any steam or emotion. I thought that after she found out who he was then I would get to read some emotional scenes, but, no there wasn't any really. I have read other books by Linda Howard and this one isn't like her other writing. More buisness talk than anything else. It was enjoyable though for a one time read I think."
3,Good but not the best!,I love Linda Howard's books. I just finished this one yesterday and was a little disappointed but it was still a good read just not what I was expecting. I do recommend reading it. It reminded me too much of the old Silhouet Romances I used to read.
2,Definitely Not Her Best,"Linda Howard is my favorite writer, but this is definitely not her best book. I couldn't believe that the main character Max would treat Claire with such little respect when he uses her to get information about a company! and then he expects her to just forget about that like it isn't important at all, when he knows that she doesn't open up to people easily. There was very little chemistry between the two characters also. They shared no romance or affection and then out of nowhere their is a steamy sex scene (which, in true Linda Howard form was very well written!). The sex scenes were great but other than that, their really isn't about this book that I would recommend.If you are truly a Linda Howard fan, their are many amazing books she has written that I recommend, Some of my favorites include:1. After the Night2. Kill and Tell3. Heart of Fire4. Mr. Perfect"
2,Domineering claptrap,"I love Linda Howard and often reread my favorite books of hers, but this was one that went right to the used book store. It was filled, as I recall, with all that controlling stuff that once passed for a marker of love but now is clearly on the continuum with abuse. Of course, nothing is as bad as Howard's An Independent Wife (and whose joke was that, I'd like to know?), but this falls in the same class. New readers will just have to decide whether they like romances where te male chaacter makes decisions for the female lead, manipulates her job, house, to get her where he wants her, and so on."
1,Not representative of Linda Howard's writing ability.,"This is a reprint of an absolutely abominable book by Linda Howard.Originally published in 1986, it is probably the only really awful book she wrote.Her hero is Max Conroy, a man with no redeeming qualities that I could discover. He seduces the heroine in order to get insider information about her employer, then has her come to work for his company.Instead of happily ever after, you wonder if he continues to romance idiot secretaries in their fictional future.The character, ""Max Conroy,"" made a brief appearance in a prior book, ""Sarah's Child."" Looking back over the decades I remember thinking at the time, that these were really bad books, but I bought more of Linda Howard's books anyway, and have pretty much enjoyed them all.She has written some good books, these are not.I really wish publishers were required to put the original printing year on every reprinted book."
1,"A really good book, THIS IS NOT!!!!!!","This book is vile. I hated the ""hero"" Max Conroy, not like he was one. He was dispicable. And Claire is basically a moron. When I read this book it took me a while to read another LH book, and I love her books. I have many of them which i purchased before reading. Thank God the only copy of this I was able to get at the time was at the library. There are one or two others I though only ok, but this book by far is a turn off if you have not read Linda Howard before. I WOULD ONLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO SOMEONE I HATE!!!"
3,cute but not so comfortable,"they are super cute but kinda hurt the toes, at least in the beginning. havent gotten past that yet"
4,The inner workings of genius!,"Anyone who loves the creative spirit will draw inspiration from hearing J.R.R Tolkien relate, in his own words, the incredible journey of the spirit that gave birth to his awesome works. Also some fine advice, imparted from father to sons, on the subjects of war, loss, courage, faith, romantic love and relations between the sexes."
4,"This man really knew people, from every era!",Especially good reading is the letter he wrote to one of his sons about the purpose of marriage and the true natures of men and women. This letter alone is worth buying the book!
1,DON'T MAKE MY MISTAKE!,"I thought this was a book about the invented alphabets of Tolkien's Middle Earth but it's NOT! It's a boring book of correspondence. Apart from the few letters where he talks a little about his invented runes and languages this is a WASTE if you are looking for more info on his runes, alphabets and calligraphy! So: BE WARNED!!"
5,A must read for fans of Tolkien,This is one of the essential sources for those readers who are fans of LOTR and want additional insight into Tolkien's creative process and the meaning of his major work of fiction. Tokien was a fine writer of letters judging by this sampling and wrote in a way that is amusing and interesting.
5,Wonderful insights. . .,". . .into the life and writing of JRR Tolkien. These letters, edited by his official biographer, Humphrey Carpenter, provide glimpses into every area of Professor Tolkien's life. We see:* his early years in the war (where his mythology all began* his relationship with his wife (a true love story)* his early interaction with those who later became ""The Inklings""* the development of his spirituality and theology* words of wisdom to his children on love, marriage, God, the Church, etc.* and, of course, the ""behind the scenes"" development of ""The Hobbit"", and ""The Lord of the Rings"" as well as numerous responses to reader's inquiries.A delightful book, and one which belongs on the shelf of every true devotee of JRR Tolkien.Well worth 5 stars."
1,Amazon Failed me,I wish I had seen the 1 star comment before I clicked above to watch this episode because Amazon helped ruin it by showing the winners of the immunity challenges. Shame on you Amazon.
2,Very undeserving,Great season but a very undeserving winner i thought Coach had it! arhhgg oh well long fun season this time around
3,Victoria,"I've now had 2 Conair foot baths and both of them broke down on me and, therefore I'm looking for a reliable brand of foot bath. I loved the jets on this machine but the vibration element quit working and since you cannot actually reach the controls (you just press a bottom and the actual control is under the plastic housing meaning one cannot investigate the problem unless you take the whole machine apart)there is no way for me to fix it and not worth cost of a repair person. Plus, it would be nice if there was a heater so the water doesn't go cold. The loofas atop the machine are worthless. I will not buy another Conair product!"
2,"very lamn, buy the dr. scholls","took it back for the dr. scholl's version. which is 10 times better. conairs heating didn't work good at all and its jets were weak. everything was weak about it. the dr. scholls version not only keeps the water warm, it will warm cooled water! it also has an infrared unit which isn't offered on the others. the jets are very powerful, as well. i was surprised. i honestly didn't expect that out of any of them. save your money on the conair. it is way over priced."
2,WEAK! Save your money,"this things is not very good. i just bought it and took it back within hours. it doesn't heat the water, like others on the market, and it doesn't even keep it warm like it says. also the jets are very weak. i hate conair and only bought it cause the lady at the store said her daugher said it was the best one out there. i don't even know how they stay in business. everything they make is usually done half-assed. i went back and went with my first instinct, the dr. scholls version. that one rocks! not only does it actually heat cool water it also has an infrared unit on the front. the jets are very powerful and it has all the options of the other delux spa. trust me, there is a better deal out there!"
2,Disappointing,"I like Sony products, but was disappointed with this one. I've had it for about 5 months and the skipping keeps getting worse and worse. It also has recently started to stop playing for a few seconds then kicking back in - very annoying. No dropping or damage of any kind has occurred to the unit, so I can only assume it's poor maunfacture quality, and, of course, all this started to happen after the warranty was up. I do like the remote, but it has an annoying loud beep when used. I'm shopping for another car ready CD player to replace it - it won't be a Sony."
5,Rough rider? try this!!,"I first tried this CD player when my friend bought it. The sound was incredible!!not just that, but it was totally anti-skip. i shook it, dropped it, and even flipped it over and no matter which way it was, the music never skipped!! i give it 5 stars!!!"
2,"dosen't resume, dosen't remember volume","I bought this CD player to use in my car. While I like the remote, I had huge issues with the fact that it dosen't rememeber where you last set the volume, so each time I turn the blasted thing on, it resets the volume, leaving me to adjust the volume while driving.The other feature missing is resume. I listen to a lot of 10 minute plus tracks and I want to rememebr where I last left off, and not have to re-find the last thing I heard. Every other car kit CD player I have ever had had this feature, why not this one?"
5,Wizard of Oz: trivia Game,"It took a long time to get it but it was worth it, it is a lot of fun. The tin was a little dented but it's unsure if it was in that shape when it was sent or if it was from being tossed around in the mail. But all the pieces were there just as the seller said they would be."
1,Wizard of Oz Trivia Game,I was happy to get the game quickly but was very disappointed that it was missing things...directions for the game and the dice to go with it. Nothing was ever done about it even after I complained to the original seller. Will not buy from them again.
3,Celebration was the best live recording of theirs,"Celebration is my all-time favourite album and this one was disappointing. I have More than a Feeling and Frontline as well, and there is more depth to those albums than their last one. Abe Laboriel, Bill Maxwell, Alex Acuna and Justo Almario are excellent musicians! Please give us another album like Celebration guys!"
4,"Yes, yes, yes!","I remember listening to these guys back in the early 80's with their first album. Loved them from the start. This album however, seems like a clear departure from their older work (which as others have said was primarily instrumental). Still, the guys who make up the group have chops! This has all the sound quality and style of smooth jazz, yet I never did hear any of these songs on the radio. Too bad too because this album is worth the price you pay. Buy it!"
3,Military-to-Civilian Career Transition Guild: the Essentail job search,I got the book as a gift for my son. I hope he read it and liked it. He has not said anything about the book.
2,Not what i hoped for!,"So I finally ordered this set of hot rollers after wanting them for quite a while.Well,I'm glad they were not expensive because I barely get a wave!Guess you get what you pay for-"
3,Clips leave dents,"The rollars are fine in that they heat up fast and do what they are supposed to do, but those clips leave huge dents in my hair that do not come out until the next washing. Now I have to buy some other sort of pin. Not worth the bother!"
2,Conair Extreme Heat Jumbo and Super Jumbo Rollers - no thanks,I am not thrilled with this purchase because of the very poor quality of the clips. Sorry to say but I would not recommend these to anybody.
2,just ok,"these rollers need to have larger edges to hang onto and to keep hair in the roller area instead of being so flat and the clips are too fat, do not snug-up the roller to the scalp. You have to use several clips in all directions sometimes then you don't have enough. Does not come with any extra clips. Get just hot enough, but not super hot, they cool down too quick. I wish I could find my old Clairol set I used to own.... Bought on Amazon, shipping was good"
3,No place to store the clips,"There is no place to store the clips! I own an older set of Conair rollers, and there is a little compartment to hold the metal pins, but surprisingly, this one does not!Overall, the curlers are ok. I like my older set better."
2,"Tepid heat, tepid product!",This is not a good product -- doesn't heat up much -- isn't worth the time of rolling your hair on the rollers!
2,Disappointed with item,"After reading previous raves on this product, I was so excited to buy it. Having naturally straight and flat hair, I would love a change with soft waves. Unfortunately, this product did not work well with my hair. As mentioned by others, it was hard to clasp in place, and kept on sliding down after I clasped it. There was little change to my hair. The most significant difference was the ends that were curled, but otherwise I would not see a difference at all. After trying it a few times, I just gave up on it, and quite honestly, I dont even know where I stored it. However, maybe it is only my type of hair that makes this product difficult to use. It worked for many others, so you may want to give it a chance, but I much rather a regular curler!"
4,Conair is my favorite product for hair care,"My hair is straight and hard to keep a curl. This Conair Instant Heat curlers are the best! It was easy to wrap my long hair onto it and used the large clips (sold separetly) to keep it in place. It got hot within minutes of turn the unit on, the hair came out shiny and the curl held for a couple of days!! I am impressed with Conair."
1,Too hot for fine hair,At first I thought these curlers would be great as they give good body to the hair. After using them for several months I have found they are burning my hair and creating a lot of damage to the ends. These curlers are way too hot.
3,Clips are useless,"The clips that come with these rollers don't hold them in my hair. They do get hot fairly quickly, but you need to get other clips to hold them on."
1,just a pain,no matter how many times i mess with these curlers it just doesnt hold! the holders always fall out with little hair to a lot of hair in the roller. the curl stays but its the messiest curl near the root or its completely straight up top and curled at the bottom. its the most difficult rollers i have ever worked with. it is a little hot to handle but not that big of a deali just hate these rollers and wish i could return them.
5,I <3 them...,"I have naturally wavy hair and I am trying to grow it out. It is just past my shoulders now. I stopped using my CHI and started just rolling my hair after it air dried. The KEY is HOW you position and roll your hair to get that full, bouncy, loose bodied look. I LOVE it and constantly get complements on my hair now I never used to get before. Funny thing, I roll 90% on my hair UP on the rollers, not under.Those of you who didn't have good luck, try that. I promise a difference."
1,Don't waste your money,"The only good thing about this set is the size of the rollers - just what I was looking for. The clips that come with the set DO NOT HOLD AT ALL!!! I complained to Conair and they sent me different clips....which don't hold either. I've been using hot rollers for over thirty years - I've never had this much trouble with a set. The rollers are not hot enough when the dot turns white, you have to wait at least another seven or eight minutes for them to be hot enough. If you're considering this set - keep looking."
5,LOVE THESE ROLLERS!,"These are THE BEST hot rollers for longer hair that I have ever used. The larger size is perfect for adding body and volume, plus they heat up in less than a minute! The first time I used them I got compliments on my hair. I highly recommend these."
1,Very Disappointed and includes no case for the clips,"The ""Super Jumbo"" curlers are too heavy to roll up...they don't stay in place with the cheap clips. I have long thick hair, so if my hair can't hold the ""super jumbo"" roller...not many others could. Also, the clips come lose with the case. The clips have no storage...it's a poor design. The ""super jumbo"" curlers are cumbersom....it would have been a better product if they left the super jumbos out of the case and added more regular jumbo curlers.Don't waste your money on this product."
3,Be prepared,"The rollers heat and curl well but the rods that hold them in place get extremely hot, to the point I actually have to lift the roller off my scalp for relief. They don't stay that hot long, but it's enough to cause discomfort. In the future, I would look for rods that have a coating on them instead of no coating."
2,Not for Thin or Fine Texture Hair,"I ordered this model because of the good reviews but this machine is not for fine or thin hair textures which I have. The rollers are nice, the machine heats up quickly, but the steel clips have a slick finish and slide right out of my hair causing must frustration.If I had thick or coarse hair I would give this a 5."
3,They're alright,These curlers are alright. They heat up fine and curl good but the clips that are provided don't hold my hair. They need to improve those. But other than that they work fine.
4,Conair CHV14JXR Extreme Heat Jumbo and Super Jumbo Rollers,"These rollers really do heat up quickly as claimed, under 2 minutes. I have the older Conair rollers, which did take longer. I bought these for the Super Jumbo rollers. Finally, there are larger hot rollers. I gave these a 4 star rating simply because I would rather have all Super Jumbo rollers, and am buying a product where I am wasting money on rollers I am not using. The four Super Jumbo rollers make spending time on my hair so much faster, it is worth it to me. Also, once you purchase this full set, you will find with the directions, an address and cost for buying more Super Jumbo rollers--which I have done. For 4, I believe it was only $7.50, including shipping. Since my older Conair rollers are several years old and still working, I expect these will last for a long time as well. And the bonus is that they do heat up quickly. A good purchase if hot rollers are needed."
3,nice but wish the clips were better,Pros:Doesnt burn handsheats quicklyample rollers for big and small curlscons:The clips are too thin and dont hold the big rollers completely.
4,Conair Heat Rollers/Jumbo,"Lightweight, heats quickly, roller material is easy on the hair. The curl lasts twice as long if the rollers are allowed to cool completely before removing.Overall these rollers are fine, but several small things keep them from greatness. The cord will not stay wrapped around the indented base, although it looks like it should, and it would be much easier to carry the case around if it did. The plastic roller clips are comfortable, and rather ingeniously shaped. Easy to clip on, but the roller has to be level on your head; otherwise the grip will not be secure enough to keep the hair or the roller in place. The clips pop apart when dropped, and go back together easily. There is no room in the case for clip storage, although there would have been plenty of room in the lift-off lid.My hair is cap-sleeve level, and these rollers give nice body, volume and curl. It's a real worth it fifteen or twenty minutes. I think this set will be a keeper."
4,Conair CHV14J Jumbo Rollers,This product is great that is why I bought it online rather than driving around trying to find that exact model in the stores. My wife says she is very happy with this product and it's performance.
2,A Little Disappointed,"The rollers are exactly as described. Cool to the touch with a velvety covering. The clips that come with the rollers work really well in keeping the rollers in your hair - however, for my hair they left indentions. I also bought the jumbo clips (extra) which don't work as well as the ones that come with the rollers. They also left indentions in my hair. This could just be that my hair is so fine. The disappointment comes in that the rollers just don't get hot enough to make good lasting curls (they are limp at best) - and with my hair being so fine and usually curling too much - I can't imagine that they would work very well on someone's hair that is thick or coarse."
1,useless product,"If I could I would give this product zero stars because that's how bad it is. There's no way to remedy the problems with these rollers. The clips do not hold the curlers in your hair and the rollers are so big that they don't do anything for your hair. I've used different curlers in the past to curl my hair and these are, by far, the worst of the lot. I can't decide if I should throw them away or try and sell them to someone else because one try was enough. I bought mine for $10 at a yard sale unused and still in the original box."
5,Very quick and easy curling!,"This is good product, easy to use, and your hair looks like you spend a lot of time curling. I love it!"
3,wasn't as effective as my curling iron,"I purchased the set of hot rollers hoping to find an easier/quicker way than a curling iron to smooth out my naturally curly hair and add back some curl after blow drying it with a round brush.As a newbie to hot rollers, I didn't find it too hard to put the rollers in, but I was sure stymied by that clip! No way of putting it in seemed to be all that effective at holding the roller in place! Another reviewer shared a link to a video on putting in the rollers that helped on that score, though the clips are still pretty bad at holding them firmly in place.The rollers seemed to reach temperature quickly(if the little indicator dot on the one roller is accurate). My complaint is that the rollers really do not retain enough heat to penetrate my thick hair all the way to the roots. The rollers were cool and the outsides of the sections of hair never got more than warm. This means the rollers weren't totally effective at smoothing frizz and imparting body."
3,Just so so and not jumbo,"These rollers are so so. First I would hardly call these rollers jumbo size, they are more like large size rollers so I get more curl than I wanted. Second, while it has a light to let you know the unit is turned on, it doesn't have any indicator light to let you know when the rollers are hot enough to use. And lastly, they don't really get that hot."
1,Disappointed,"I have very long, normal/thick hair. The pins kept popping off and flying across the room. The rollers didn't get very hot. It created weak curls in the front and the curls in the back fell out instantly. I ended up returning them and bought Jilbere ones instead that come with clips that help keep the rollers in place. I'm very happy with my new purchase."
1,Waste of time and money.,"Do not waste your time and your money on this product. The metal clips are completely awful and do not hold your hair at all, the end up falling right out. Then when you finally get them to stay, after much frustration, they poke at your scalp to the point where it is unbareable for them to remain in any longer. The curlers do not reach a high heat, and therefore do not curl your hair. I kept the curlers in for about 25 minutes, and when I took them out, my hair was exactly the same."
3,"Great rollers, BAD clips","I love the size and number of rollers in this set. Perfect for my shoulder length layered hair. BUT whoever invented those clips hates women. They fly off, don't hold the hair, totally useless.I bought a set of the conair superclips and they work fine."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"I bought these a few months ago and the lid has already broke. I emailed conair, NO RESPONSE! Your hair gets stuck in the middle of the rollers. NOT GOOD, I would not buy them!!!"
2,Not so great,"I bought these rollers because I wanted an all-jumbo set for my long hair. I have used this type of clip-roller before with no problems, but on this set the clips do not hold the rollers securely and they tend to droop or even fall out. Maybe with another set of clips it would work."
1,"Definitely not recommended, clips are terrible!!","These just won't hold.I called Conair and they sent me wire clips which fit the jumbo rollers, but not the super jumbo which leaves me with 4 rollers which are unusable and 8 rollers aren't enough to do my hair. the smart clips that come with them won't hold especially on the top of my head and they leave marks and dents. Not happy at all with these."
3,The rollers are great... the clips are NOT.,I always liked Conair hot rollers and so when I needed to replace my old set I purchased more of the same. The problem are the new clips that come with the set. The clips simply do not hold the roller in place - let alone the larger super jumbo roller. I had to purchase another type of clip to securely hold the roller in place.
4,Jumbo Rollers,Conair SPC10R Super ClipsI love these rollers. They give me big Farah Fawcett curls. The clips do not stay in my hair very well so I bought the Conair Super Clips and they stay much better. On humid days I spray each piece of hair with hair spray first before I wrap it around the curler and the curl stays better.
4,Too big,"I like the rollers, and Conair has always had good products. What I don't like is the size of the rollers. I wanted large rollers, but these are a bit large for my hair. I use them anyway, and they will suffice for now. I wish they had an automatic ""off"" switch - but they're hard to find in electric rollers."
1,disappointment,The product was defective when I received it. The return was difficult. I could not find number to call Amazon with problem. I would purchase from local store next time for easier transaction.
1,doesn't work for me!,I bought this to curl my hair because it got great reviews on amazon. I tried it and it won't curl my hair AT ALL!! i can't even figure out how to pin the rollers to keep it rolled up. Either way i tried holding the round thing with my hair wrapped around it and nothing happens. Maybe i'm just not getting it lol. Got the chi iron instead and so worth it!
1,fer git these!,"these are THE worst hot rollers that i have ever used, and i have been using hot rollers since they came out in the 60s. the wires to hold the roller in your hair are too short. they keep falling out! and that space in the roller............ OMG the wire gets caught in it and if the ends of your hair happen to be there you get crimped ends. these are blacklisted as far as i am concerned.!"
5,foolproof smooth large curls,I've only had this for a few weeks and love the results! These heat up quickly and hold all day. That said it is likely that you will want to buy separate clips for these unless you know how to use retro granny style pins; I didn't even try to use the granny pins as I was able to save the clips from my last set of curlers. You can find curler clips on Amazon or at Sally's Beauty for a few bucks. These are the largest curlers for the price even if you splurge for the easy to use curler clips. This was a smart purchase.
3,clips don't always stay in place,"rollers are good but clips pop out and are somewhat difficult to position correctly so roller is snug. difficult to tell the clips apart, the jumbo should have been in a totally different contrasting colour, now is confusing and hard to differentiate from the others. delivery was quicker than expected."
1,Don't buy,"Loved the fact that the rollers were big. Nothing else was worth using. While it heats fast,the metal SHORT clips don't hold the roller in place and if you don't put enough hair on the roller, they burn your head. You would think Conair would have enough experience to know better!"
4,"Great rollers, useless clips!","This product is perfect for the style I am looking for. I have long, below shoulder length hair, that is fine. This size roller gives me the body I need with a curl that is not too tight. The only reason I gave this four stars is that the clips they sell with the rollers are useless. I needed Conair SPC10R Super Clips to keep the rollers in place."
4,great for home use,"I've been using the remington h-1015 hot rollers. Love the compactness of the set but the rollers are too small especially now that my hair is longer. A co-worker recommended the conair chv14jxr and I really like this set. The rollers are much larger and they heat up quickly. I'm used to the metal u-pins so I have no problem keeping the rollers in place. The only problem is that the set is about 3 times larger than the remington and takes up too much room in my gym bag. Consequently, I use them primarily at home. So, my hair is straighter on gym days and fuller/bouncier on non-gym days.UPDATE: Now that it's warmer, I've started taking these to the gym (summer clothes take up less room in my gym bag). I no longer spend 25+ minutes straightening my hair. I just dry my hair quickly and pop these rollers in. I've cut down my time at the gym by about 15 minutes. Really glad I purchased these hot rollers."
2,poor product,"The curlers burn your hands and head as you try and put them in place which would make you think you would end up with at least a good curl. However, curl does not keep. Look for hot rollers that have a claw to hold the curler in place as this product does not and doesn't keep curler in place. Seller was great but product not so hot."
4,Nice product.,"Heats up quickly and stays hot. Curlers are covered with a soft velvet material which is gentle on the hair. I am happy with this set overall, my only complaint is that the pins do not keep rollers tight in my hair. I bought clamps to hold them in place. I do not know how anyone can keep the curlers in with those stupid pins."
3,Efficient - when the pins aren't popping out,"Super fast heating time. Hassle-free, effective design - except for the fact that the pins often pop, rather, fly off the rolls once I've fastened them. It's rather amusing, though not so efficient. i.e. I secure a pin over a roller, move on to the next roll, and - swoosh! - an errant little object goes flying across my bathroom in a flash, zipping discourteously off my head and onto the floor. While this causes endless entertainment for my cat, it's not so fabulous for my coiff."
1,Great idea with fatal design flaws,"The velvet around the roller is great but, like everyone else said, the slot on the roller leaves crimps and the dumb metal clips they give you do not keep the rollers taut enough to do a good job. My hair is easy to curl and even after hairspraying it, and keeping the rollers in for 20 minutes, while the metal clips burned my scalp and neck (I literally had to lift them away from my neck so they wouldn't burn me), I still ended up with just slightly wavy hair and NO body nor curl at the top.. I'm returning them after just one try."
2,I'll stick with my curling iron,"I'm new to the roller world, but although this product is exactly as described, it is way too much of a hassle. I attempted to use the rollers for the first time over the weekend. I had trouble right off the bat getting my hair to stay in place while rolling it up. When I did manage to get the strip of hair to stay in place and roll, the pins were ill-fitting and the rollers fell out almost immediately. Additionally, I kept burning my fingers on the rollers. I would love for my hair to have more body, but this is more trouble than it's worth. I'll stick with my curling iron!"
2,"If you want ""politician's wife"" hair...","I have thick, medium length hair. These curlers created way more volume than I like, giving me terrible helmet hair. I tried rolling them in different directions, and nothing seemed to help. These are too jumbo for me. Would probably work better for someone with finer/thinner hair.Pros: heats up very quickly."
2,Terrible for fine hair,"The curlers get extremely hot. Thus, if you have fine hair, they burn your scalp. The clips are very hard to get to stay in. I am sorry I bought these and wish for a great replacement. They do curl hair, so that's a point on their side, and they are quick to heat up -- to a burning temp."
2,No place to store the curler holders,"These were OK, they curled my hair pretty good. But I was most frustrated because there is no little door or compartment to hold the wire holders. So my curlers are in one part of my bathroom, and my holders are in a drawer. Not convenient."
1,What took so long?,Dear Conair: What took you so long to make super jumbo rollers? Most of the women I know have been wanting larger heated rollers for at least 10 years. To be even more honest you increased the size of four rollers and yet some how couldn't possible figure out how to create a receptacle for the clips? Really?This design as been around for at least 30 years and requires more functionality.
1,Bait and Switch!!!!,"I ordered these rollers from Amazon because they were less expensive. They sent them to me, but they were the next model down that doesn't have the new clips (it has the old metal pins) and it doesn't have the ion shine mechanism. I thought it was an honest mistake, so I returned them and had them send a replacement explaining my dilemma. They very quickly sent me a new one, but it was THE SAME LESSER MODEL.I explained again and sent it back for a replacement. They sent me a note saying that they were going to refund my money instead and that they couldn't help me.Bait and Switch for sure!"
4,These are great rollers.,"Theses rollers are especially good for those with lots of long hair. I am not crazy about the clips, but they work okay. The curl lasts....except in very humid weather...same as other methods. Holding products like foam and hairspray extend the hold."
2,The wire clips don't go in easily,"The rollers heat up enough, but it is difficult to get the wire clips in the right place because of the design of the roller. It has an opening on each side from which it heats up on the machine. But then to navigate the clip away from these 2 openings is a major pain. I'm either going to buy a new set of rollers or look for a clip that clips easier."
4,"great rollers, long & heavy hair","I have very thick hair and it's really long (almost to bottom of my breast). All my hair fits in the rollers given but I do suggest getting the white clips to use with the product. These do not ""curl"" my hair but adds great bounce and fullness to it. Heats up fast and curls fast too. I'm able to get the kids ready with the curlers in my hair, even though they are a little heavy because they are ceramic. Would definitely recommend!!"
1,Thought they were good for a while,When I first got these this summer I thougt they were nice. They heat up quickly and I didn't mind the split down the middle. Then some of the rollers I have dropped on the floor did not seem to fit smoothly into the slot they heat up in and and the stress of pushing them in and pulling them out started to cause the rollers to break apart.Just this week the back row of rollers stopped heating up and the front row does not seem to have temperature control. The front row got so hot the silver plastic started to melt!!!!I'm disappointed because I did like them.
2,The WORST hairclips ever invented!!,Great rollers that heat up fast but who invented the clips???? They are a disaster; I am using my older clips for a tighter hold. These newer clips do not work and one would think in the instruction booklet they would have a drawing to show you how to put them in securely. What planet are the folks from CONAIR living on??
4,let them heat longer than 2 minutes,"The first time I used my new rollers they worked amazingly, but the next few times I was disappointed that the curl would fall right out of my thick straight hair. After trial and error, I discovered that if I let the curlers heat up for about 10 minutes (rather than the two that are advertized), I end up with fantastic curls that will last until the next time I wash my hair. One other 'downside' is the clips that come with the set - they leave me with little crimp marks in my hair. I highly recommend buying the conair SPC10R super clips. They don't leave marks, and they hold the rollers in place far more securely. On the whole, though, I am very satisfied with this product."
3,slow to heat up,"Delivery was fast, but the hot rollers take about 20 minutes to get hot enough for the hair then you have to leave them in for about 20-30 minutes, I had to do it 2x to make it have body, I have long thick hair, I would not buy them again"
5,So much faster than my old curlers,"These are great! They are usable in 2 minutes but seem to reach maximum heat in 5 minutes (the dot changes color at 5 minutes, also). I don't like the clips that came with it, but Conair also sells clips for hot curlers. I got a package of 10 for less than $10 and they do a good job of holding the curlers and not leaving a mark. My hair is fine but not thin, so I guess I'm putting enough hair on each curler so I don't have a problem with them staying in. I finally got tired of my old 30-minutes-to-heat curlers. So glad I spent the money on these!"
1,good idea poor product,"I bought the jumbo hair curlers as a quick and easy way to give my hair body during the busy morning. I really like the size of the curlers and they become hot in minutes, all positive. The frustration comes with the clips that are used to hold the curlers in place (low quality). The plastic clips are held together by a circular metal piece. They are constantly falling apart, as easily as it is to put them back together, but doing it repeatedly every morning, especially when you're in a rush is just irritating. I believe that there are better quality product out there for the same price."
1,really bad design,"The design for this product is flawed. The clips that hold the curlers on are: 1. way too short to hold the curler to your head, I had to use the clips from an old set or else it wouldn't work and, 2. fall all over the place because there isn't a place on the product to hold them. How hard would it be to create a few holes to hold the clips?The curlers do heat up pretty fast and I like that there are two sizes."
3,CONAIR EXTREME HEAT ROLLERS,This product is good if you are looking for very loose large curls. My hair is just below my shoulders and when I use these curlers my hair is very wavy. Heats up very fast.
1,Hard to believe they do NOTHING!,"I have fine, wavy, medium-long hair. I let these heat for half an hour, left them in my hair for another half an hour and nothing. Maybe a slight bend in my hair. Also, the dimensions are off. They are not 1/1/2 and 1/3/4 inch diameters but about a quarter inch smaller overall."
2,"NOT DUAL VOLTAGE SYSTEM, CONAIR ROLLER","I ordered this roller set and it is NOT DUAL voltage. I ordered again because I was told by Amazon was dual voltage and again (2 time) received and is ONLY 120V. Amazon should clarify this information so the client doesn't trash time and money sending it back. do""t RECOMMENDed."
3,Not exactly jumbo & pins are substandard,"These could be considered large and extra large .... ""Jumbo"" or ""Super Jumbo"", they are not. If I were to make recommendations to the manufacturer, it would be to offer 6 (instead of 4) super jumbo curlers and make them larger and offer the remaining 6 (instead of 8) in, what is now, their jumbo size. Also, the pins are too short and do not always hold well. Longer pins need to be included. On the upside, this product heats rapidly and has an off/on switch on the front .... features that I like."
5,Great Longlasting Curls,"I purchased these rollers to replace an older different brand name set. I have always used hot rollers, never a curling iron. My hair was soft and bouncy after each use. I use this product daily. It heats up really fast. Great for long hair. Would recommend highly!"
2,didn't work for my fine thin hair,I was disappointed with these curlers. They did not stay put with the included clips in my fine thin hair. I am returning them b/c it was too frustrating trying to get them to stay w/o slipping.
3,"Good, but not perfect.","I hadn't used hot rollers in years, but my hair is now past my shoulders again and I wanted to do something different. After reading reviews, I settled on these rollers. I really like that they are large and jumbo. It takes all the rollers to curl my entire head, and the curl is very natural. They warm up quickly and get very hot (watch out!). The main problem is that they are flocked instead of having teeth, so they seem to slip out of my hair if I don't wrap them tightly. I have fine to medium straight hair, and think I need to experiment with different products to see if I can give my hair more texture before I put the curlers in."
4,hot rollers have poor instructions,"The directions are not clear. I waited and waited for the red light to go off, then reread it and realized one of the rollers has a tiny dot that turns off. My next challenge was learning how to use the metal clips. There are no instructions, no photos, nothing on the web site, and no help from the company. I finally learned how, through trial and error. The first time I used them, my hair was all dry and static -- awful. Then I read on the internet that I should use setting lotion. I could find that nowhere, but someone suggested I use a light mousse. Finally, I got the desired results -- a little body and fullness in a relatively short time. No burning either."
1,"no curl, 20 year old set much better","These do not get hot enough to set a curl. Unfortunately, the box was recycled with the other Christmas boxes so I guess Goodwill get a new set. Perhaps they will work better with another hair type. My hair has a good bit of body and is shoulder length, thick, but very fine."
2,You ladies have crimps in your hair.,"I have looked everywhere for jumbo rollers, and these seem to get the best reviews of any of the lower-priced items.But when I rolled my hair with them, there were crimps in my hair from the lines down either side of the rollers. I can't think of any creative way to avoid the crimp, so I got rid of the rollers. (And yes, I did notice that they were way too hot to hold on the plastic ends).I'm sure everyone using these has very pretty curls, but they're probably also walking around with crimps in funny places all over their heads."
1,Awful.,"I bought these from another store, and they are just terrible. They made my hair static, and I do not have a problem with static hair. They also leave a mark in my hair from the slot where they are heated. I would not reccomend these to anyone, regardless of what these other reviews say, I would not buy them!"
2,Falls Flat,"Bought this for my girlfriend, because she really wanted a quick alternative to a curling iron, something she could leave in her hair while she does her make-up. She tried it for a week before returning it. Even with extra clips, the curlers would fall out. Her hair is naturally curly and usually holds a curl for days, however her curls fell within minutes with this for some odd reason. This is the second conair product we've had to return. Don't think I'd buy their products again."
5,Great curlers!,"I really am loving these curlers. I get SO many compliments when I actually take the time to put them in... I will say that it takes time to get the technique down. And I often get frustrated when they won't stay in. I recommend having a few big claws on hand to clamp down the bigger rollers of the set, they tend to slip out of my hair. All in all though, take 5-10 minutes to put them in and it looks like you spent an hour doing your hair. Can't beat that."
3,Needs an on/off switch,I purchased this because it was repleacing a Conair heated rollers product that had an on/off switch at the front. Furthermore the picture makes it looks like such a swith exits. I am keeping the product because I like the large and extra large rollers.
3,Not like the hot rollers I had back in the 80's...lol.,The ends get very hot and burn your scalp while are in. Leave my hair frizzy. The clips are hard to take out.
2,Didn't work for my fine hair,These absolutely would not stay in my hair which is pretty thin and fine. I even bought the white comb clips (which left horrible creases by the way.) I went back to the old reliable velcro rolls which you can't heat up but they work much better.
2,"Clips are wrong, different than pictured on Amazon","I already have a Conair hot rollers (which I really like) with plastic clips the ones pictured on Amazon. The hot rollers I received came with wire clips. I wanted a new one. The wire clips do not hold the curlers in, they fall out.The picture on Amazon shows the plastic clips come with the rollers.I received the rollers 7/8/11 and the clips are wire...I cannot use them.I would be happy if you sent the plastic clips. Otherwise I will return the rollers."
2,Hot Curler Review,"Curlers are large, which is good; however, they don't grip hair at all. The pins to hold them in place burn your scalp. I have tried them 3 times, but I plan to return them. I would not recommend these. They are equivalent to the old curlers from the '70s..no advances/improvements."
2,Not Very Hot,I have long hair and these rollers only give me a slight wave. They just don't get hot enough. But on the bright side they are made well and when I want just a little wave they do the job very well.
2,THESE ARE OK,"I bought these curlers at Target on clearance for 19.99. They are ok but b/c my hair is shoulder length they were too big. I did like that they came in large sizes thougha nd they did heat up very quickly. The clips are these plastic clips that you squeeze the ends and it opens up, but they are very thin and do not hold well at all. I am returning thema nd going to try another set."
1,Extremely poor design,I have been a fan of hot rollers for decades and these are the worst I have ever owned. The opening down the length of the roller makes it difficult to insert the pins and there is no place to hold the pins. All my sets in the past have had a place to hold the pins. I travel frequently and must find a separate container to hold the pins.I will replace these as soon as possible.
3,I returned them.,"These weren't horrible but they didn't work that great for me. I didn't like the velvet material that covers the curler -- felt like the end result was less curl and limper hair. After giving them several tries, I returned these and went back to using my old curlers -- they're smaller but at least there's noticeable curl in my hair when I'm done!"
2,Waste of time and money,Brought this thinking wow nice big size curlers for nothing! How do you manage this hot curler in your hand? By the time you put them on your hair it's not that hot and the the clips do not make any sense as they are lose and weak
3,Just ok,"Well, they do the job, but they are not all that easy to use. First, the cloth cover of the roller makes it slide right through my hair (which is somewhat fine in texture.) This makes it difficult to roll up successfully. Second, the clips are not good at holding the roller in place. If you really want to use these rollers, buy the plastic clip-on clips that hold the roller more securely. Finally, I was pretty surprised to discover that there is no place available on the unit designed to store the clips when the machine isn't in use.I'm sure there has to be a better product out there somewhere."
3,Conair instant heat jumbo rollers,"This item rated a 3 star as it is not exactly what I was looking for but couldn't find anything with larger rollers. My current roller set is very old and is a steam set with jumbo rollers (larger rollers than the Conair set in a small case). The Conair set is difficult to travel with due to the size. I would prefer a steam set with more super larger rollers and smaller case. Otherwise, the item is doing ok."
3,Average curls,"This is a nice looking curler set, but the actual job it does is not what I was hoping for. The curlers are very hard to put in because there is no room for your fingers to work without getting burned. Also, I highly recommend purchsing separate clips because the ones that come with it don't hold your hair very well at all. I wish they would make larger rollers, but these are teh largest I could find. I also searched a ton of websites and this was the best price. I haven't traveled with this set yet either, so I'm waiting to see if it holds up. Not a waste of money, but not a hair miracle either....sorry ladies!"
4,Nice surprise-beautiful hair,"I finally noticed that the super jumbo black rollers go with the black tipped clips.The rollers get a lot hotter after about 10 minutes.I have thick curly hair just below the shoulders and I style it in 2 ways: One is to air dry - when completely dry I roll it - result is very soft subdued waves, not the big messy look I had with smaller rollers. The other way is to blow dry it as straight as I can and then roll it. My hair looked like a TV commercial - curved on the sides, the back had undulating waves, my highlights shimmered. What a nice surprise."
5,One More Detail or Tip,"This might not work for everyone but it worked for me. Make sure your hair is EVER SO SLIGHTLY DAMP before you use the curlers. If your hair is already completely dry it won't work as well. I don't mean wet or damp. I mean as I just said, JUST SLIGHTLY DAMP. It will set and hold better that way (Again leave in for 20 minutes). And when you take out the curlers don't immediately brush out your hair either. Just let the curls or hair sit there for 5 minutes. Then brush it out. If you want a few extra curls on the side or/and top try also if you have the time and inclination the conair curling iron, 1 inch for bigger curls and 1/2 inch or even 3/8 inch for smaller. If you want then spray it with a good light hairspray for the finishing touch. OK?"
2,Tack an extra $10-15 on to the price: you must buy the Super Clips,"These heat up quickly and give big loose curls, but forget using the clips they come with. They're more like clamps, so if you have fine hair, they will literally clamp wide ridges into the roots of your hair - exactly where you're trying to create volume! What the roller giveth, the clip completely taketh away. So be prepared to buy the Super Clips, which are somewhat better (and you gotta love Conair - the Super Clips come in a set of TEN, although the roller set has TWELVE rollers). No accident, I'm sure. So if you're okay with having 10 clips for 12 rollers and paying $10-15 more than you thought you would, these might be the rollers for you."
1,TERRIBLE!!!!,"I have hair that is down a little past my shoulders, and is of average thickness. I bought these rollers looking for curlers that would give me softer, larger curls than I get with my hot sticks (those end up very tight and spiral-y!). Weeell, these didn't give me a curl at all! All they did was make the very ends of my hair a little wavy, and didn't do a thing to the top of my hair! It was as straight as ever!At first, I thought maybe I had put too much hair on each curler, so I tried just curling HALF of my hair with all 12 rollers, but got the same result: No curls, just a tiny bit of body at the ends of my hair. I even left them in for 20 minutes instead of the recommended 10 minutes. I know I let them heat up long enough, too, because a few rollers burned my neck.This is the worst hair-curling product I have ever come across! Even my grandmother's foam rollers (that have no heat) work better than these things! Don't waste your money!!!!"
2,Slightly Disappointed,"After having luck with a pervious set of Conair hot rollers I decided on this one. There are four jumbo rollers and eight large rollers, this is great but what isn't great are the clips! They don't fit the jumbo rollers once you get your hair wrapped around it and they leave dents in your hair. They are large, plasitc, hinged clips so storage is a pain as well, there is no storage for these clips on the set itself so I had to find a little plastic bucket for them. This will be a pain when I travel.My previous set of Conair hot rollers was pretty similar to this one except all of the curlers were the large size and they had regular metal clips with storage for the clips on the set. I wish I could find this same set again!I am sure there are other hot rollers on the market that would be a lot more convenient!"
5,Wonderful!,"I have long, superfine hair. I'm an avid user of hot rollers. I bought these because I wanted more of a wavy effect instead of the perm effect and these rollers do just that.No complaints, they work excellent. They don't heat up to super hot, which is much healthier for my hair, not to mention they are a great price and Amazon shipped them to me for free. Who can argue with that? :)"
3,"not bad, but wish it can stay on better...","These are not bad rollers, just wish they can stay on more secure. But even with half fell-out rollers, it still makes nice curls or waves."
1,Exhausting and tedious,"I had read a lot of Emily Dickinson's poetry and some brief article biographies of her life before reading this book. So I was looking forward to a book-length biography. I was disappointed. I feel the book could have been edited down to one third or one fourth of it's tedious length. Who really cares about a relative's business dealings? I skipped over those boring pages, trying to find facts on ED's life. I didn't find much.I feel I can know more about Emily through simply reading her poetry, some of which I still find hard to understand. I admire her for not seeking fame or money through her gift of writing. She was a true artist with words.Go to this site to read her poetry online: http://www.bartleby.com/113/."
5,THE DEVELOPING GENIUS,"In my opinion this is the best biography of Emily Dickinson. Habbeger integrates the most recent scholarship with independent judgment to paint a sophisticated and sympathetic picture of our elusive genius. Unusual in a biography is his clear story line that allows us to watch Dickinson's gradually developing sense of herself and her vocation against a background of deep prejudice against most kinds of accomplishment for women. ""[We] should keep in mind that she was a noncitizen by force of custom and law, that many doors were closed to her, and that she left behind more good hard work than any of us."" (page 504) The general reader and we amateur Dickinson freaks will find a treasure house of information, insight, and enhanced appreciation of our off-center idol."
4,Entertaining English Country Club Mystery,"Consulting Miss Silver seems to be tantamount to asking to be murdered. As in several of her other cases, Miss Silver is approached by a person who wishes her help. The next thing she knows the person's murder is headlined in the paper.This is a not too shabby locked room mystery. The locked room is a windowless annex to a country club (once the murderee's private home). It has one door for which there are only two keys, one in the possession of the owner, the other in the hands of his secretary. The approach to the annex is along a glassed in corridor that is lighted at night so that any person using that route may be seen.Yet one day Lewis Brading is found dead in the annex and it seems that only one man could have murdered him. However Miss Silver is there to make sure that the guilty and not the innocent suffer.Nice collection of eccentrics, interesting post WWII milieu. Pretty good mystery."
4,"Ships exactly what is shown, disregard ignorant reviews.","Come on, people. They ship EXACTLY what is CLEARLY in the picture. You think that you should get what's in the picture on the package showing an example of typical use? So you still go to the trouble to write negative reviews even after YOUR own mistake should be obvious even to you? Amazing."
1,Item received does not match photo,The photo is of a hook that can be mounted. The item is actually just a rotating clip that goes on to a hook/bracket/etc.
1,Quake 3 Arena,"This was a very disappointing game. Although this review is several years old, I must say that this game did not meet my expectations of a good computer game. It was boring and redundant. I don't recommend it for any computer gamers. There are a lot better games out there to spend your money on."
3,deccent shoes,Cheaper Puma imitations. Good if you like the style and don't want to pay for the Puma name. The quality is a tiny bit lacking but not too bad. They are a lot more comfortable than my Pumas!!! that's a huge plus side. They probably won't last very long though.
3,A good start,"For a book that's self published, as the writer paid to have it published through iUniverse's Writer Club, this is a good start. The author has taken things into his own hands; and while his work is a little rough and lacking, he can certain grow into a better playwright with some professional productions, writing classes and experience."
4,Impressive!,"I am a playwright from New York and even though this book is self published it has great quality. The plays are very original and some are quite funny. I recommend this book of plays for those who are looking for something different, but amusing."
5,very good book,it is s very good book. i read it in 2-3 days it kept me so intoned. it is about a man wanting a sled team and ends up getting the best sled team. and he has a strong love for his dog but also for a girl he almost loses ti another guy. i had a harx time putting the book down there were times when i was up to 2-3 o clock in the morning.
4,Liz Taylor and Richard Burton,"It was pretty good for it's time. There was definitely chemistry between the stars. Cleopatra's hair bugged me a little because it morphed from 30 BC to 1950s toward the end, and she had four kids, not one. Overall, it depicted a smart, savvy, sexy woman who more than held her own in a man's world, at least for a little while."
2,Out of date,"This movie is not timeless. Even with famous actors, it seems dated and poorly executed. It does not stand the test of time."
1,"Cool design, lukewarm coffee.","This coffee maker seemed like a great idea - the coffee brews straight into the thermos, so you don't have to decant it into a thermos or keep it on the hot plate the entire day. However, because the water is only heated for a few seconds, you end up with coffee which is simply not hot enough. I like my coffee to be just too hot to drink when I pour it. I drink it black, but if you like to add milk, you definitely need it hotter as the milk will cool it down even more.The design of this machine is simply beautiful, but I ended up returning it to the store because of the temperature of the coffee. I exchanged it for the Krups Crystal Arome Plus Time, which has very similar features and design, but brews the coffee on a hot plate. I recommend this second machine - it's 20 bucks cheaper and 20 times better."
2,My Last Krups,"I've had the same issues with this coffee maker as many of the other reviewers. This is just a shoddy design. I can deal with the less than hot coffee because I expect that with a thermal carafe, but I didn't expect weak coffee due to the poor flow of water over the grounds (you can see it after brewing: the water passes straight through the center, leaving surrounding grounds untouched). I also didn't expect to have to use duct tape to keep the filter basket closed due to the flimsy metal piece that bent beyond use in 1 month. Disappointing product, and my last Krups."
2,Not buying it again,"It makes good coffee & thermos is useful, but there are a few things I didn't like:- The lid of the carafe is awkward to close sometimes. I spill coffee more compared to other carafes I've owned.- Once in a while, I don't push the filter box all the way, causing coffee to overflow - I know this is my user error, but it happens more often than usual with this machine.- Carafe handle broke after 1.5 years of use. It looks like the issue was loose screw & a piece of degraded metal that connects the carafe and handle. I was disappointed how cheaply it is made, for the price I've paid.I'm looking for something a little higher quality for my next coffee maker - I might have to pay more but if it can last more than 1.5 years it's worth it."
2,Disappointed,I bought this coffee maker to keep the coffee hot.....for at least an hour. Does not do it unless you preheat the caraff and brew an entire pot. A partial pot goes cold. I am aware that you need to remove the caraff from the brewer to conserve heat and I do. This machine is also very loud which surprised me. We now refer to blasting off a pot of coffee rather than brewing one! All I can say is that I'm glad I bought mine at half price. If I had paid full price I would have returned it.
2,Exploding Krups caraf,"Had a Krups Aromacontrol for several years. Not as good as prior Krups models, but rates about a B overall. This morning while rinsing it out at the sink, it literally exploded like a gun blast. There was glass everywhere. I did not hit it anywhere, and was doing my normal ""rinse"" when this happened. Incredible mess."
4,carafe issues,I received the Krups Model 199 as a gift from Amazon.com. It worked great for 8 months until the carafe shattered internally.
3,Great Potential,"We saw this coffee maker and were excited about it. Great design. We read the reviews and since most of them were positive, we decided to go ahead and purchase it, but ordered the stainless steel thermos to go with it since for some reason, they don't offer it in the white model. Well. . . Two important things here--first, the feature that allows you to stop the brew and pour a cup of coffee only works 50% of the time; second, another reviewer mentioned that the coffee is brewed at drinkable temperature, which does not allow for adding anything to it or for preserving the temperature for very long. The coffee itself turned out great, but there are so many other coffee makers that can do the same job. For some, the ability to pour while the coffee is brewing is not a big factor, but for us, it was the important, deciding factor. We returned it."
1,Over Priced,"You pay a premium for nothing more then styling with this product. This is a high priced coffee maker that you are lead to believe makes better tasting coffee. It's all marketing! Save some money and buy a less expensive unit. The coffee doesn't taste any better then less expensive coffee makers. What is aroma control anyway? Also, I don't think the coffee stays very hot for very long. You had best be prepared to drink your coffee immediately after it is brewed if you like it hot."
2,lightweight exploding carafe,"This thing is all plastic and so light that you must hold it down with one hand to remove the carafe. I velcroed it to the counter. Now after owning it for a year the vacuum carafe exploded just sitting there. The water filler is hard to pour into and I sometimes spill. Best features are a good cup of coffee and the ""sneak a cup"" valve which lets you remove the flask while it is still brewing. Definately over priced, I wish I hadn't discarded my old ""Mr. Coffee""."
1,Not Good,"I very much admire Rachel Cusk - I've read all of her books and quite enjoyed them. But ""In the Fold"" was so lacking in anything to capture my interest that I couldn't even finish it. It is a story filled with characters who are weird, who say odd things, who seem to appear and vanish like apparitions. People just don't talk like this - the dialogue is extremely tiresome.There was not a single character I cared about, and everytime I went back to reading, I had no recollection of what transpired previously and had to re-read the previous several pages. This story had no warmth, no heart, and seemed a pointless use of time. Very disappointing, as I expected something truly great."
2,"C'mon, really?","I agree with the review that stated that there was not one character that I could relate to, care about, or even want to wonder about. Usually I can lose myself in a character that is written by an author of the opposite gender, but Michael did not ""sound"" at all like a male. The only good that came out of this book was the discription of life on a sheep ranch and the struggles of a rancher in modern times."
1,folded,"Although I have enjoyed many of Rachel Cusk's books, this one I didn't want to finish. There are other opinions: it was long listed for the 2005 Booker Prize.In the Fold is narrated by a man and full of dialogue. Perhaps an important step in a writer's development is to try something different. It gives you a reference point: You do that better than this. And then you can go boldly forth.My favorite thing about the book is the name of the country home where most of the action takes place. It's called Egypt-no explanation given. My favorite line refers to Egypt: ""This is our home. It's the place that matters, not the people in it."""
2,Terrible to the point of being laughable,"Although the Egyptian section is interesting for the scenery, the book is otherwise deplorable and shallow. The writing stinks. The plot is worse. This is the type of book that Elizabeth Peters has been so successful at paroding in her Amelia Peobody series. Want a better book with similiar location? Read Crocodile on the Sandbank."
1,coudln't stand reading it,"sorry, i couldn't stand reading all this twisted drama.... :-( too much misery... very descriptive, nice writing but couldn't stand reading the story...."
5,Brilliant writing,"I was enthralled with the book from page 1. But what I really loved about it was the language. The words lulled me into almost believing I was right there with the characters. I got totally lost in the language; but that's certainly not to take away from the story itself. The way the parts were organized, and then the big shocker--took my breath away. I remember I had an appointment I had to get to, and it was just about the time I had to leave when I ended the first part of the book. I literally yelped, ""NO!"" But maybe it was a good thing I had to stop there for a bit, because it gave me a chance to catch my breath, and go back over what had happened leading up to this. I couldn't wait to get back to reading it. Anyway, I thought it riveting, and an excellent read."
5,fingersmith,I love this book there are so many twists and turns I cannot put it downit truly is a captivating book
4,fingersmith,"FingersmithI LOVE this book. I found it a very intense story, and could'nt put it down. I read alot, not many books hit me but this one did. Thank you Ms. Waters."
4,A Fascinating Novel,"As always with a Waters novel, you get excellent writing, well drawn characters, and an intrigueing story.The only reason I did not give this novel 5 stars was because of my disappointment that there was not one truly good person amoung any of the main characters in the book."
5,Amazing!,I just had to come here to post how much I loved this novel. The plot twists were amazing!!
1,Kindle version more expensive than a book? Come on!,Why on earth should the kindle version be $12.99 while i can get a printed book for $10.88? Publishers get with it. Alienate readers and we will have no issues downloading illegal versions of your books. This is robbery. You will be left in the dust.
1,The Worst Ausicious Novel I Have Read in Years,"This is the first and last book I will ever read based off of its inclusion in the Booker Prize short list. Why this was ever critically aclaimed is beyond me. The storyline is preposterous (although, I admit, I was slightly engaged in the first of the three parts, but that was before the emergence of ridiculous plot twists), and the writing lacks the wisdom, insight, and, at the very least, technique to pull this novel about Victorian porno fiction into a realm that could remotely be called literary. If you want a good laugh, read this book. It has offered me many moments of amusement, but overall, it is trite."
5,A true page turner,"I just finished reading Fingersmith and I want to say that I haven't been this engrossed in a novel in months. I read mostly historical fiction, at least one book a month. This is a true page turner with lots of twists and turns. I could not put it down. This is not a book for the faint of heart or for someone who wouldn't like reading about the slums of London or about lesbians. If you can get past that, you will love this book. If you want a fast pace and a good story that really comes alive, this is a winner. Sarah Waters is a master story teller. I really would like to suggest this book to my historical fiction book club, but most of these ladies would be put off by the sexual overtones. I thought it was handled with finess and great sensitivity. I loved it."
4,Captivating!,"This was my first book by S. Waters and I was impressed! All the twists and turns will have you at the edge of your seat!The two flaws I found were: (1) she could have told the story in fewer pages; some parts of the book were very slow-moving and didn't seem to add much value, and (2) compared to the rest of the book, the end seemed very rushed."
5,Become a Fingersmith Addict,"This book, like the BBC Production which is available on DVD, are both 2 of the most wonderfully written book and screenplay. You can't help but get caught up in the romance between Maude and Sue. In fact I dare you to read the book or watch the DVD and then not want to start all over again.This is all a credit to the wonderful Sarah Waters. She writes so that your mind can see exactly what she wants you to see, her descriptions, vivid, her plots wonderfully diverse, and her love story telling is out of this world.Sue and Maude are 2 characters that will stay in your thoughts for days, maybe even weeks after.A MUST MUST MUST BUY>>>>Incase you do get addicted check out the group I set up at YouTube. Wonderful music videos made by very talented fans.www.youtube.com/group/fingersmith."
3,Fingersmith,"A little slow at first, but picked up soon into the book. Lots of unexpected twists and turns that made the book interesting. It made for a good read."
4,Twists and turns galore.,"This was a surprising book. I was hooked pretty quickly. It chopped and changed pace, constantly revealing unexpected twists and turns.A great holiday/plane read as it was hard to turn out my bedside light."
3,fingersmith,There was an underlying lesbian theme which was unnecessary but as a whole this was a very good book. The historical background was very well written. I could clearly picture the various characters and events. Many unexpected twists and turns to the plot.
3,"Insanely engaging, but...","As I began reading, this novel could not have been more involving...what a find. And Waters' ear for language, for dialogue is astonishing, at times. So a great combo: narrative drive and delectable prose.The book was slightly marred for me, though, by its predictable anti-male attitudes. All the men in this book are vicious, weak, or misogynist. (Or all three.) I didn't find this a problem in Waters' two other books, the wonderful Tipping the Velvet and Affinity."
3,Strange Indeed,"When I received my copy of Fingersmith, I immediately started to read it. I made it to about chapter 4, then stopped for awhile. This book is one of the strangest things I've read in my life. It has some really wild plot twists and involves quite a few ""controversial"" themes. If you like reading modern Victorian literature or you enjoy stories by Charles Dickens, Fingersmith is a must-have for you."
2,No redeeming value here,"Although the writer's craft is well done, with some surprising twists to the plot,overall the book was dull. The characters are all low life petty thieves, who have no honor even among themselves. By the end, I felt that they all got what the deserved, but felt no sympathy for any of them, I was just glad I didn't have to listen to their amoral self pity anymore. Although Fingersmith has been likened to Oliver, and it seems derivative in terms of setting, Sarah Waters original additions, (the lesbian relationship, the baby dealer, and the misogynistic con-man,) mired down rather than elevated this tale."
1,Tedious...,"I'm sorry but I have to disagree with many of the other reviewers of this book. It's taken me a long time to read (3wks) because my interest in it has been waning. In my view the narrative is at times turgid and flawed, dialogue implausible and the description is lacking. The few bits of heightened tension are when the two main characters have a 'liaison' whilst letting on to each other next morning that they were asleep. Also, when one of the key characters is killed. For such a fat volume there's not much going on that couldn't be tailored neatly into 100 pages. Dickensian it is not. Read this and then read anything from Dickens and then you'll realise the difference is like walking from the night into day. You get the impression that the author herself got bored with the process of writing it and only livened up at the start and towards the end of the book."
2,Disappointed,"I secured this book specifically because of the glowing Amazon reviews. The first 100 pages left me uninspired. I stuck w/the text though; hoping it was just off to a slow start. It does get better towards the middle, however, it never really picked up tempo, remaining redundant and constantly supplemented with non essential fluff throughout. The insane asylum piece drug on and on. ""I'm not Maude, I'm Susan"" torture, beating, humiliation, cold baths ensue, lather - rinse- repeat. Her escape and subsequent return to London were interesting, but the much hyped plot twists and turns were predictable. I could also do without the lesbian love affair. All around it fell flat of my five star expectations. Boo."
2,Lukewarm lesbian romance,"I am afraid that I completely missed out on what is meant to be so mesmerizing about this book (judging by the other glowing reviews.) Firstly, the plot is melodramatic, verging on ludicrous and unbelievable. The two main characters, Maud (the lady) and Sue (her maid and lover) never come alive. They are like wooden dolls moving through Victorian London, and are almost interchangable. The only thing that is good is the accurate period detail and Water's ability to create atmosphere. But much of it is just padding, padding, paddding, and even when you get to the bones of it, there is nothing much there, save a few good sex scenes and some very detailed descriptions of ladies underwear.Admittedly, I gave up on this half way through. Maybe it picked up towards the end, but I doubt it."
1,Blindsided/Lesbian novel,"Wish I could have used a 0 rating! Nothing I read in the blurb or in the sample from Amazon led me to realize this is a lesbian romance. Definitely NOT what I am interested in reading. I deleted it from my Kindle immediately--and I haven't even paid for it yet. I'm angry and ""ripped off."""
2,Interesting but annoyng twist and turns that don't quite add up.,The story is unique and interesting enough to read but not one of my favorites at all. The twists and turns are too numerous and hard to keep straight. Not sure the plot is plausible enough to buy into.
4,Trashy Dickens.,"Interesting book...kind of like trashy Dickens with a whole lot of suspense. I read the majority of it in one sitting. It was pretty compelling, with a lot of plot twists and turns. Great characterization for the time period, too"
5,21st Century Dickens,"Right from an early reference to Oliver Twist it's clear that this is indeed Dickens updated for a new century. The squalor of Victorian England is vividly portrayed here, but Waters' page turner of a plot takes us further, to the dirty corners of society even Dickens didn't dare to investigate - lunatic asylums and pornographers' libraries. The setting convinces and the themes of greed, betrayal and love are ably handled. Pigeonholers could call this a 'lesbian novel' - again a theme unexplored by Dickens - but *Fingersmith* is much more than this, and anyone who likes reading should try it."
4,still reading,"I'm in the middle of this book now, so bear with me.First off, discovering Sarah Waters was the most exciting thing to happen to my recreational reading life in years. I'd rate Tipping the Velvet at 10 and Affinity at a slightly disappointed 7.As I get to about the halfway point at this book, I have to say I like it slightly more than Affinity but less than Tipping. SW seems to really get into the complicated plot twists - and I'm talking more about the not-really-believable surprise-switcheroo kinds of twists found in Affinity, not the ""ooh, now the heroine is embarking on an unexpected adventure"" ones of Tipping. Also, less sex (than Tipping) and more cerebral angst (life Affinity) make it a less joyful reading experience than it probably could be.Anyway, I'm exaggerating with the nitpicking here - there is plenty of (good) melodrama, great characters and description. Had serious trouble putting it down to come to work this morning.I hope this one has a happier ending than Affinity."
5,"Amazing, Only a Small Let Down","I thought Fingersmith was one of the most brilliant novels I have read in a long time. When you get to a plot twist, you are dumbfounded by the revelations that are put before you. I did, however, think the book's ending was a bit weak in comparison to the rest of the story. This is a small complaint, though, compared to the masterful talent of Waters' prose."
3,Fascinating but Fluffy,"Since I was just getting into GIS at my work place at a government agency, I was curious when I saw this book from Amazon's search engine. It has many fascinating accounts of various widely diverse applications of GIS systems being used all over the world to solve previously intractable problems. Anything from mapping mine fields in the Balkans to coordinating ride services for seniors in Portland. While the stories themselves are quite interesting, the writing style and quality is a bit uneven between the 15 or so stories. My only other complaint is that it uses a liberal amount of white space and fluffy fillers (i.e., big font quotes, etc.) to make the book seem longer than it really is. I'm not quite sure it's really worth the price for what you get, but it is a good idea book for what GIS could possibly be used for."
3,Puberty Blues,"An odd title but a pretty cool movie. It's sort of an Australian version of Fast Times At Ridgemont High but better. The Australian accents are great, and these guys get chics with lamest lines but the chics just want some anyway. It was one of those movies that you see late at night on some obscure cable channel and never forget."
4,A great example of modern Italian music,"I grew up in Naples and feel that I can recommend this album, or any album by Pino, as an excellent example of modern Italian music. It is a great mixture of Neapolitan, blues and many other influences. All the songs on this album are ones you will listen to over and over. I recommend getting someone who speaks Neapolitan to translate the lyrics for you as they are heartfelt and intelligent. Pino e bravissimo, gente."
5,Have a taste of modern Naples,"This collection of songs was my first exposure to modern Neopolitan music, as well as Italian blues/jazz.""TUTTA NATA STORIA"" and ""MA CHE MANIA"" are up-tempo and exhibit Daniele's guitar playing as well as his soulful voice. ""MAGGIO SE NE VA"" is beautifully melodic in the ""old"" neopolitan style. His band includes such accomplished musicians like Tullio di Piscopo, a talented drummer and singer in his own right.Enjoy!"
4,smaller than expected,"I purchased this toy for my three year old son for Christmas. He absolutely loves it. The car comes with a Robin figure, his motorcycle and the car. He doesn't like to play with the car too much but he likes the Robin and the motorcycle. My only problem is that Robin is very small so he gets lost alot. HE is about 2 or 3 inches."
5,Birdfeeder,"I have had 2 of these feeders for 20+ years, they are still working great, so just bought 2 more. I have 4 now. The birds flock to these feeders, I have had other kinds, the birds do not use them as much. These are great for rainy weather, which we have alot of the time. The seeds stay dry!!"
3,Finally a feeder that I can fill and walk away for a few days!,"Great feeder, attractive and has a very generous seed capacity.The only downside is that the clear plastic it is made of won't take much punishment. One very windy day my feeder fell to the ground and the plastic cracked in two places, rendering it unusable.I loved the feeder so much otherwise, that I got a new one...same feeder. As long as it's VERY securely mounted and you don't drop it, you should be good. It is rather expensive to replace.Edit: Considering that I am among a number of people who have bought this more than once due to its fragile nature, I have reduced my stars from 4 to 3. I really do think having to replace it was not entirely my fault."
1,Fragileness Outweighs Usefulness,"Some lesser flaws - water drips in from a poor top seal, on windy days the seed blows out of the tray, (especially thistle/niger seed), plastic clouds up after a while. Biggest flaw however, is what happens when it falls. I had just filled one with sunflower seed when a smarter-than-average squirrel chewed through the nylon rope I had it suspended from. The feeder literally exploded when it hit the ground. I found pieces 25 feet away. Other pieces I never found at all. This product has been drawing similar feedback for at least 4 or 5 years, but there have been no improvements. Guess the manufacturer isn't concerned about repeat purchasers or improving product quality."
1,Done in by a squirrel!,"If you have squirrels that can get into your feeders, do not buy this feeder. Within a week, the squirrels had managed to break the tray and knock the whole bottom half off. The plastic really isn't strong enough for the size of the feeder. Spend your money on a sturdier feeder!"
1,CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AWFUL,"The feeder has broken on me 3 ----yes 3 times! It supposedly has a ""lifetime"" guarantee. The lady was pleasant enough, but she let me know that I have to pay $12 EVERY time the feeder breaks. I have no squirrels that can access this feeder. The plastic is VERY brittle (maybe due to the fluctuation in temperature in New England?) and the feeder tube keeps breaking. Falling right down spilling a mess of seed for me to deal with. I asked her if I called again in a year because of another broken tube was I going to get charged again? (Mind you this is the 2nd time I've paid) ""Yes."" Not the quality or treatment you get with Droll Yankee or Aspect. I will continue to buy from them exclusively. Never again with this piece of inferior junk!!!"
3,Good Feeder with One Flaw,"I have had a couple of these feeders and they are wonderful for repelling rain and squirrels (if mounted properly). The big flaw is the plastic is not very tough and, if the feeder falls to the ground, it usually shatters. I have put more than one back together with duct tape, but I would love to see this type of feeder made with a bit sturdier construction material."
2,Not Durable,3 days after I received it the wind knocked it off the chain and it fell to the ground and shattered! I guess $60 dosen't buy unbreakable plastic.
3,great feeder breaks easily,"love the feeder. this however is my last one. the design is great for the birds, but the plexiglass is brittle and breaks easily. a drop of the feeder shatters the feeder. have broken 2 in 2 years. love the feeder but the product is not durable."
3,Nice design but not popular with my birds,"I like the design of this feeder and it's nice how much seed it holds. I live in a big city and my only outdoor space is a fire-escape where I hung this feeder. I've had a mesh sock feeder for quite some time now (which birds love) and I thought adding this new feeder to the space would attract more birds. Unfortunately, it's been a week and I haven't had any takers. My birds seem to still be going for the sock feeder and ignoring the new feeder. It's a little windy where I live so I'm not sure if the lack of visitors is because the feeder sways in the wind, but it's disconcerting since I spent $60 on this feeder! Hopefully the birds will discover it soon, otherwise I'm taking it down in favor of a more traditional vertical seed tube."
4,Best Feeder We've Found/,"We had this feeder in the past, but it was destroyed by the marauding West End Bear. Replacement feeders were never as successful at keep the squirrels at bay (We use it with a pole baffle) or as popular with our favorite feeders: Red Breasted Gross Beaks and Cardinals. I would recommend this feeder to anyone, although it is not inexpensive."
2,sky cafe doesn't fit,The top and the bottom that holds the seed do not fit. It hangs in the tree lop sided and there is nothing I can do to keep it straight. Piece of junk!
1,The cover is a lie.,I wish I would have never purchased this DVD. The cover looks as if it's a really good movie but it's low bugdet.
3,Disappointing,"Having read so many books on the subject of the Warsaw ghetto that I felt this one offered nothing new. It was very short though there were some good quotes in it, I felt that so much of what it said has been said many times over. It was not one I wanted to keep in my collection of books on the subect of the Holocaust and the Warsaw ghetto. The author had lived in Warsaw briefly and it would have been nice had she expanded on that more; she did say that her apartment was on the site of the former ghetto and she could see fragments of the old wall. I would liked to have known that this book really contained nothing new if one has read a lot on the subject. FOr someone not familiar with the Warsaw ghetto it could be of interest and helpful."
5,great solo effort from the chain,"jerry cantrell the songwriter of alice in chains layne stanley RIP who's alice in chains day were dark and sombre well don't expect any different with this album it's a full frontal album with great lyrics cantrell voice is great and the lyrics are superb this is the only jerry cantrell solo album i own i'll hopefully get some more soon, but as i haven't at the moment every so often i put on this album and remind myself of his genius and a masterpiece"
3,Could've been better,"Vocals kinda wimpy, some parts kinda ehhh cheesy? I have to listen to it every now and then just to make sure I don't miss it. I kind of expected more of an AIC Sap sound since Jerry sang a lot on that and mostly cause he writes more than the majority of their stuff anyway. Oh well, better luck next time."
2,I miss Alice In Chains,"Okay, I cannot expect Jerry Cantrell to sound like Alice In Chains, but I don't like this record because it's too much mainstream. The lyrics are silly and the country ballad (track 11) is just awful. The album is not actually bad I had expected much more from a guy who wrote such classics like Would?"", Rooster"", Down In A Hole"" or Them Bones"". Too bad that Alice In Chains are history."
1,"too slow , horrible lyrics","I don't know why Alice in Chains broke up but this solo album of Jerry's is horrible compared to the music we are used to hearing from AIC. The songs are too slow and wimpy and lyrics are well, horrible. He still has a great voice but if any unknown artist were to put this album out I don't think it would sell."
4,"Not quite Alice In Chains, but close","I had just started getting into AIC when this album came out, so I did not buy Cantrell's solo debut until a few years later. I knew that it would not sound the same, but I didn't think that I would be disappointed. ...And I wasn't. The first three songs are as good as any AIC songs, and there are a few other great songs on here as well. Some songs are just a little too experimental for me (although they are not bad by any means), and this is my only problem with it. I can't wait to hear some of Jerry's new stuff.Layne Staley - 1967-2002 - RIP"
5,I liked this record,"When I first bought Boggy Depot, I didn't like it because I was expecting Alice in Chains. I didn't listen to it for a while, then one day I decided to sit down and give it another chance. I listened to the album quite a few times, listening to different instruments each time. I especially like the songs ""Jesushands"", ""Settling Down"" and ""Keeps the Light on"". The vocal effects on ""Breaks my Back"" were interesting, and the more I listened into the layers of guitars and vocals, the more I appreciated this album. It goes without saying that the drummer is good (Sean Kinney) and the bass playing on the album is also excellent. I find the way Cantrell constructs a song to be as interesting as Kate Bush or Pink Floyd, and the record should not sound like AiC, because it is not AiC (which is my favorite band of the 90's). It's a Cantrell record. Cantrell has alot of talent as a songwriter and musician. I hope he makes another record."
5,Eases The Sorrow,"Alice In Chains was and still, officially, is the greatest grunge-rock band of all time. Following their unofficial breakup Layne Staley went on to do things with Mad Season when he wasn't messing around with smack. Cantrell also experienced these same problems but he too overcame them and went on to make his own solo album. His awesome guitar skills don't grow any duller from how they were in the days of AIC. I found myself not missing Staley's vocals as much as I expected and soon found myself absorbed in the music. It's a great CD, very under-publicized and a must have for any grunge-rock or AIC fan. Definetly worth every cent I payed for the CD."
4,Love our phone,"We needed a corded wall phone in case our electricity goes out, as it often does in rural areas. While redecorating the whole house we began looking for a corded phone to replace our old one. This phone is perfect for our new look. The phone is a little loud when you talk on it, but that could just be that we set it louder than necessary. We wanted the look and are completely satisfied. It's just cool and works when we need it to work. Love it!!!!!!"
3,Mounting Problems,"I like the phone but when mounting on the wall my electrician found that the toggle bolts were defective , not expanding as they should ( fortunately he had some on his truck ) and the phone is a little wobbly and he suggested drilling some holes on the top and bottom and placing some screws into the wall to secure it."
3,Bells and Whisles,"This is a great looking phone and seems to work well. Because I happen to like the country look, I was truly disappointed that it rings like a regular phone. The bells are just decoration and that still would have been ok if only the ring tone would have made the correct sound. If I'd have been aware of this, I more than likely would not have purchased it."
1,not satisfied at all,"i bought this phone expecting it to be very much classic stuff. but upon getting it found out that it was very much different from what i expected. there was no rotary dial, and the bells on the top donot ring, it was just for a show. so i sent it back. and i am very thankful to amazon.com which processed my returns and refunds much quicker than i anticipated. even though i didnt like the product and sent it back, i will be a amazon.com shopper."
1,Phone does not hang up.,"This phone looks great. I can even pick up the receiver and talk on it, make outgoing calls, and what not. However, when I try to hang up...the phone does not hang up. The line does not disconnect. After a short while, you get very loud beeping, and all the phones in the house are useless until this phone is disconnected from the wall. I might even make a youtube video review for you, just so you can see what happens with this thing.I'm considering taking it apart to fix it. Otherwise...it may just be a very expensive wall decoration."
1,RINGER DOESN'T WORK,Everything about the phone is fine BUT the ringer doesn't work. What good is a phone if you can't hear it ring? Returned.
3,Kinda flimsy,"It looks real nice in the kitchen but is not recommended for a main use phone, more for looks and it does look real nice."
1,Looks are deceiving,"This phone looks great but the quality is lacking. Numerous reviews note the problem of disconnecting calls. My problems was just the opposite. When my phone would ring I was unable to answer it unless I held up the cradle during the call. Finally, I took the phone apart to see what the problem was. It turns out that there is a tiny (and I mean tiny) spring which operates the cradle mechanism (resembles a very tiny version of a clothes pin spring but hairlike in dimension)which was snapped in two and would be impossible to repair. So to the dump this phone will go.I did not purchase this phone through Amazon but want to make potential consumers aware of the poor quality of this product."
1,What a waste of good cabinetry,"The cabinetry is really beautiful;elegantly designed, nicely finished and sturdy. Unfortunately, the electronics are defective. No dial tone and no sound from the headset. If you read other reviewers experiences, you'll see that you should only buy this product if you like a crap shoot; if you get a good roll of the dice, you'll get one that works, at least for a while, and if you don't, you'll at least have Amazon's outstanding return policies to fall back on."
3,looks ok but...,looks nicce but is a little flimsy on the components. I would buy a heavier duty one if I was to buy one today.
3,OK I guess...,"The main point of interest of this movie for me, is that it is the oldest movie I have seen that freely uses the word F##K. I guess that before 1970 nobody used to swear. Oh, and I really hated the ending. Glad to see Susan Sarandon kicked on though, although we had to wait 20 more years until we got to see ""Thelma and Louise"". I'd say to prospective ""Joe"" watchers, see it, but don't knock yourself out."
4,great gift for parents,I wanted to get the Susan Boyle CD for my elderly parents' Christmas then realized the only CD player they had was in their car. This worked out wonderfully & my father was really impressed with the sound quality. He will also be able to listed to AM talk radio while sitting on the sun porch now. We all enjoyed it Christmas morning while sitting around and will go great with my folks' decor (my mother is such a stickler about the interior design of her house).
5,J. Kendall,This item has much better quality sound than some bigger cd players that I have had. It has a beautiful vintage style and fits in a small space. The only small problem I have is the cd buttons are hard to read in dim light but that won't be a problem when I learn them.
1,Damaged Radio,"I have received this radio damaged. It is very likely it was damaged in shipment. I suggest that any seller of this or any other fragile device give careful consideration to the packaging. The factory packaging is not suffficient to protect the radio in case of the usual handling by the carrier. I say that because I communicated with the seller because he limited the packaging to that of the ""as received packaging from the factory"". He impressed me as a very conscientious and sincere person. He tried to replace the radio but was unable to duplicate the same model so he refunded my purchase price."
4,"Decent CD, average to poor radio",Just picked one of these up. It is a very good looking system and the looks match th epicture.The sound quality is abotu what you expect not bad not great.The radio tuner did an average job and had some trouble picking up some stations.Overall I'd give it a B
5,"Works fine, good price","I have a husky powerwasher and BOTH of the standard nozzles broke on me. So I bought this despite the poor ratings. I must say that it works better than the original nozzles. The key to having success with this product is to READ THE INSTRUCTIONS and make sure that you CHANGE THE NOZZLE ends in the gun head. They give you a big allen wrench and 3 other pressure nozzle. By default the bronze pressure nozzle in the gun can only handle 1350psi. So if you just put on the end, plug it into to your fancy 1800 psi washer, IT WILL BREAK. BUT, if you properly put in the right nozzle, it works like a charm (the pink nozzle for me since it is 1800-2300PSI). The adjustable fan spray is a really nice feature since you can either get a straight stream out of this or go with a wide fan spray, which is a nice feature. I like it!"
1,You get what you pay for,"I had to send this back to Amazon. The set screw that is required to be removed to adjust for different pressures would not come out so that the correct pressure screw could be installed. Low price, now a 2-3 month wait for a replacement (not Amazon's problem, but the manufacturer)."
2,Not at all universal,"I read all the reviews before my purchase, and still bought this set. If you own a Greenworks electric pressure washer, stay away from this unless you want to waste your money like I did. It does not fit properly and leaks like a sieve."
3,Not Satisfied Customer,"I wanted this to work so bad, but it leaks! I used Teflon tape, but it still leaked. I wasn't soaking wet, but I was wet. This would work fine if you have the exact match for that adapter. Those adapters are meant to fix perfectly together to prevent leaking. Even with all those adapters, no match...probably planned out by the other manufacturers...this way, you have to buy an entire new sprayer handle and extension. BUT you might be lucky and find the perfect match...I have a handle that doesn't leak and I want to find a match, but this wasn't it. So I had to go buy a full sprayer handle with the extension at a much higher price."
4,Works great!,"Very happy to find this product, it works great! Thought I was going to have to buy a whole new powerwasher but this product fixed the old trigger!"
5,Excellent item,"I was looking for a replacement nozzle for my water pressure machine, but I found this FAIP Powerwasher universal kit for less money, has other adapters and is more durable than the original one. It is an excellent purchase for the price."
2,Not very comfortable,"I have several different Calvin Klein bras that I like a lot, however this style is not very comfortable. I like the lightly lined cups that provide some support and shape. However, the underwire comes up too high in between your breasts and can be uncomfortable by the end of the day."
3,Old school Bad Religion wanna be's,"Man did NUFAN sound different in the late 80's early 90's this band has been around for almost 20 years and they used to have a more punk/metal sound before they got all poppy. this album is ok there are only a few stand outs mostly the title track and ""when it's gone"" but after those I could swear i was listening to some old school Bad Religion which would be good except that their songs arent that great and their vocals by tony sly tend to be weak at times. Kind of bland but their lyrics are pretty good too bad they only write about love now."
5,this is adressed to the guy at the bottom,"exscuse me but...your dumb. blink 182 is pop-punk, no use is hXe, learn the difference numb nuts."
4,"Solid phone, good reception","The phone is adorable. Love the yellow. The sound is very good--I don't have to strain to hear with it. There is just enough weight to the phone to make it feel solid. Comfortable to use. Design is just a little different from the original, but still very cute. If I could change anything it would be these 2 things: (1) The cradle holds the receiver up a little bit. It takes some getting used to because at first you feel like the phone isn't sitting correctly. (2) When you push the buttons to dial, it makes a sharp noise in your ear, which is a little annoying. I hold it away from me when I dial. These are small things, and I am overall very happy with the phone."
3,"believe me: ""less is more""","Proves yet once again that the old saying ""less is more"" holds true. This could've been a 2 album release. Had 5 weakest songs been taken out, it would've been a much better album. As it is, I give it a 3. Not groundbreaking, nor revolutionary, nor too exciting, but for $6.99 it's just fine."
5,Amazing guitar album,"Joe Satriani is really incredible, this album prove that he is one of the best guitar player, if not the best. Yes, there are many incredible guitar players around, but Joe is without a doubt, in the top rated guitar player around the world. Greatly done Joe !"
3,"Good Music, Bad Sound Quality","First the good: this disc musically is a lot like Satriani's earlier releases, and that's a good thing. Now for the bad: the sound quality is pretty bad. No highs, no lows, mostly midrange. Sounds like a blanket is thrown over your speakers. Did anyone listen to this before it was released, especially Joe himself? I think not, if it was me I'd demand it be remastered."
3,If your just looking for something new this isn't too bad!,Crystal Planet is not too bad of a buy. Train of Angels and Ceremony which are great songs really save it. This however is not a CD I would listen to strait through.
4,Great music from a master:crystal clear!,"This is probably Satriani's best effort in the nineties,a brilliant statement from a musician who can combine out-of -this -world virtuosity with ideas,rhytm and,most importantly,feeling.Displaying an impressive command of the fretboard,he never forgets harmony and atmosphere.This record is a best of genre."
2,Selfish shredding,2 1/2Just-another-rock-virtuoso-electric-guitar-record that cannot equate gloriously unrelenting solo runs with rhythmically enticing songwriting.
2,Joe takes a step backwards,"When his self-titled album was released I was initially diappointed, but soon found it to be the richest, most soulful of his releases. So this album turned out to be a real let-down. Instead of continuing to break new ground, it seems like Satch is just trying to make another Surfing with the Alien. Many of the songs follow a Surfing-type formula, with obligatory modal shifts and power-chord intros. There's little evidence of any new ground being explored. He's never been good at song titles and this features some of the worst. Still, if you hated the self-titled album, you'll probably enjoy this tired rehash of his old stuff."
2,RINSE. LATHER. REPEAT.,"What happened to the prowess and melodies of the first 2 Satriani 'albums'? 'Crystal Planet' is OK, but ultimately, it all sounds the same, and is not memorable. Sure, there are some great hooks and riffs, but they go nowhere. Sorry Joe."
5,Simply Amazing,"I can't believe this album is almost 5 years old. I still listen to it all the time. If there is better music out there than this, please let me know."
4,"Great guitar, but nothing new","Make no mistake, I thik this album is a fantastic listen. Joe's chops are as fine as they've ever been, and it'd make a good introduction to Satch for new listeners.However, if you've already heard Surfing With the Alien and The Extremist, Crystal Planet doesn't have many more musical ideas to offer. It's more of the same (of course, when ""the same"" is those two great albums, it's hard to say that's a bad thing!). And the tunes just aren't as memorable this time around. I can hum Surfing or Flying in a Blue Dream or Always With Me, Always With You, but I'd be hard pressed to recall a tune from this album if asked.Still, new listeners and dedicated Satch fans alike will find a lot to like about this album."
4,What was I thinking??,"I just gave Crystal Planet another listen and I don't know why I let it collect dust since I bought it last year. Been a Satriani fan since ""Surfing..."" and pretty much felt Surfing was the prototypical, definitive Satriani love fest. Well... I'm enjoying the heck out of Crystal right now and would have to say it's right up there behind Surfing, and better than everything else (wow, do I really mean that?). Gems are the title song, and, well actually the first half of the CD is fantastic.. (entering the 2nd half as I type this - been a while :). One difference here is that it sounds more like a band (the drumming is fantastic) as opposed to just Joe in a studio with a drum machine. It's a bit more upbeat than the others; fast and multi-directional. You gotta love these new chord directions he takes us. So... if you're a fan (or even if you're not), what can I say.. it's worth it! Surfing would have to be a ""5"" - sorry."
5,Spell Bound,"Mr. Satriani takes the guitar into a truly divine explosion of passion and energy on this CD. It is very hard to impress me on the guitar, but Joe just leaves me spell bound! For the guitarist and layman alike, Satriani delivers quality. One can tell that he pursues his instrument with the efforts of a true hero. My compliments and congratulations to Mr. Satriani."
5,By far THE best album of 1998,"If you like musicians with talent, this album is a must-have! Satch has never failed to deliver great music, and is THE best guitarist of the past decade. And if you ever get the chance to see him live, go - you won't regret it."
5,Satri is getting better,"Each new work of Satriani is better then the previously released, bass and drums are also fine, check it!"
5,Satriani's music is masterful. I would recommend this one!,"There was a time when I would not recommend pure rock guitar music to my friends. However, Joe Satriani has peaked my interest with this little gem. Joe rocks hard on many tracks while he plays softer on others. A nice mixture of electric and acoustic guitar. ""Variety"" is the operative word for CYSTAL PLANET. I would highly recommend this CD to anyone looking to expand their guitar music library. Brilliant work, Joe!"
4,Consistent,"Usually I write really long reviews so I'll keep it short. Joe has switched over the years from albums that are mostly hard rock sounding along with an occasional ballad to albums with songs that cover many different genres where the lead guitar serves the place of the lead singer. Although ""Time"" is overrated, ""Lights of Heaven"" and ""Train of Angels"" rank up there with some of the best stuff he has ever done. There are many decent songs on here as well such as ""Psycho Monkey"" and ""Ceremony."" As always, Joe is amazing on guitar. Essential for guitar players, but can easily be appreciated by rock fans as well."
4,King's gift of description is truly amazing!!,"Such a page turner. King turns such well-crafted prose; he intertwines the intimate details of the murders of the two girls, with routine details of home life of the warden as well as the daily grind of several prison wardens. His gift for description of the most ordinary or even routine things such as the last 40 feet walking to death in the electric chair is extremly breathtaking. I am waiting with baited breath for book number two!!"
5,THE KING OF HORRORS BEST SINCE IT,This was a great book and for only being one of a series of books it surprised me the sick pictures of the girls corpses were very disturbing which made the readin better iIcan hardly wait for the nex to read
5,King writes here like a child with a new toy.,"I am a fan of King. Have been since I was thirteen andpicked up Salem's Lot. I can feel the short hairs on the backof my neck rise just thinking about it. Unfortunatly,I was dissappointed by Dolores Claiborne and everything since.Just when I thought Mr. King lost the means to make my skin crawlhe comes up with The Green Mile. King writes in this book likehe's found a brand new toy. I guess everything old is new again.I did not think I would be pleased with the serial format butwas I ever wrong. I couldn't put this short book down and was ready, ohso ready, to get my hands on the next installment immediately after I did.This is Stephen King at his absolute best. The protagonistand narrator is someone King makes you care for. The setting is asdark as you could possibly request of any writer of horror.And if you don't feel claustrophobic after just a few pages,you should go get a transfusion because you can't have much bloodrunning through your veins."
3,Good after I figured it out.,"I came very close to returning this product. At first I could not make a cup of coffee that was not luke warm. Also getting the fliter back in place was very difficult until I got the feel for it.Eventually I learned not use too much milk and also to steam for a longer period. My old boiler based machine would steam faster, but now I understand that pump machines run cooler to avoid bitter coffee.You must learn the proper order to do things. You have to run a heatup shot through the machine after turning it on OR after steaming milk. It is not necessary after making coffee. This gets everything nice and hot for making the espresso.Generally, I start up, run a heatup shot, make however many shots of espresso, and then steam/froth the milk. This is the most efficient method.My only major remaining complaint is that the filter will not let all of the water drain and I do not get a dry plug of grounds after making the coffee."
2,Espresso Lover,"I tried this model from Capresso and was not impressed with the performance of the machine. Too long to wait for warm up and for finally brewing espresso. Espresso result was marginal.It appears that it's an entry level machine yet the performance from my Briel CHAMONIX machine is much better for about the same price. The Briel unit has the automatic espresso flow feature which is a great bonus.I'm sure that the higher end Capresso units are better in terms of performance,but I'm going to pass on the Thermocoil."
2,"Worked fine before, but now useless","As other reviewers have mentioned, we had to learn to let the machine heat up before making espresso. After that, we were satisfied. Now that we've used it for over two years, however, it has become an ornamental door stop as it no longer pumps at all. The trouble shooting instructions sometimes helped, but no longer. For the price we paid (two years ago), I expected a unit with higher quality and reliability."
2,Capresso Espresso Maker,Unit is unpredictable. Sometimes you get an excellent brew - other times it is weak. Have better success with the cheaper steam producing models.
2,Haym Salomon,"Haym Salomon Son of Liberty by Howard Fast is a much better book on this subject. The cover says it is written for ""young people"" but it is so well written that adults would enjoy it also."
3,presumably good for very small size places,This wont help you eliminate strong odors in places big enough to spend any time in....
4,Does what is says..,"I have very little tolerance for strong smells, especially people who wear way too much cologne or perfume. Working in a closed office environment exposed me too way too much of both and was getting to be very uncomfortable. I bought this hoping it would help and it did even more than I had hoped for. It's not perfect but it at least made things tolerable. At this price you can't do any better."
4,Great for litterbox odors,"We have 4 cats (and a dog, and some fish..). We keep our litterboxes in a glorified closet/crawlspace and used to have a problem with the ammonia odors sometimes seeping out into the family room. This product has taken care of the catbox smells wonderfully! In fact, I had an air freshener in the room that usually just mingled with the catbox odors, and within an hour of putting this in the cat smell was completely gone and you could only smell the pure air freshener (which became pointless after using this product.Overall, it does what I wanted it to do, and I'm happy with it."
2,"A glorified ""Dummies"" book...","If you are looking for a juvenille picture book to explain how to use certain components in Windows XP, then this is the book for you. If you are looking for something with substance, DO NOT buy this book."
5,Er... AWESOME,"This book is sooo Awesome ... (AWESOME)..... The plot is there, the setting is there and characters are there .. (well, some of them die) Seriously, this is well worth it. BTW : He killed Ton Phanan... nooo !"
5,This is one of the best Star Wars books I have ever read!,"I have enjoyed all of the X-wing books so far, but this one has to be my favorite. Allston has outdone himself this time, from the space battles to the humor. The humor is why I like Iron Fist so much, but there are other reasons too. This Star Wars book, unlike others, actually has a sensible, fun plot, and doesn't focus on what we know as ""major"" characters. That alone should put it right up there with the Zahn and Stackpole works. I look forward to seeing more books from Allston.""yub yub, commmander"""
4,It was pretty cool,Iron fist was a cool book. I really enjoyed it it was exiting and intellegent and the only reason I didn't give it five stars was because I miss rogue sqadron
4,Good Deal,"Not as fast paced as the firt of Allston's books in this series, but still easier to read that Stackpole's books."
3,"Decent, yet lacking.","This is a good book, but needed more polish. The characters are their norm, but it was too slow. Characters such as Shalla Nelprin and Kell Tainer are well designed and way cool (hand-to-hand combat is wicked!), but certain characters seem a little vague. And finally, their was not enough action to carry the story. Hold on, what story? Allston needs to take a few pointers from Timothy Zahn, the Grand Master. Flying scenes were fairly good, but this book could have been so much more. And while I can relate to the Wraiths more than the Rogues, I prefer Pash, Corran, Gavin and especially Mirax; find me a girl like that and I'll be in heaven. In all, a good book, but only to die-hard fans.Knight Blade79"
1,"Deny Physics? A scientist maybe, but not an author","To start it off simly the book made no sense. When the two SSDs were battling the Mon Remonda, they should have won in a minute. Mone Remonda doesn't have 50 turbolasers or even 30 ion cannons. An Imperial Star Destroyer has 60 turbolasers and 60 ion cannons. And Mon Remonda is battling a SUPER Star Destroyer. REalistic? I think not. If you're an author and want to learn about how NOT to write, this book is an A+ example. Otherwise, run for the hills!"
4,near the best...,"OK, this is where I draw the line. If you want to comment on the author's writing style, and emotion, and the human-ness of his characters, do it here. But looking right into the technical facets of his book? Oh please, this is a criticism of the book, NOT a foray into a technical journal. So please, those two people arguing about the Mon Remonda having 48 turbolasers, etc... GET A LIFE!To continue, this book is wonderful. Laughter, and tears, heartaches, and cheers, they're all there. Who cares if there is no Luke Skywalker or if there is an adult Han Solo (hmm, oxymoron there)? I like the way Allston explored his characters. More could be done for the other characters of Kell, and Runt, etc, but hey, unless you want a Lord-of-the-Rings-length novel, it's really OK..."
4,First time I ever cried while reading SW,"I LOVE the Wraith books. However, this book was really sad. Without spoiling it for anyone, I will say that it made me cry and I stopped reading it and didn't pick it up again for almost two years! But it's a GREAT book, and I highly encourage you to read it. (But the sad part made me give it only four stars instead of five.)Oh, and once again-Face and Phanan ROCK!!!"
3,Could Have been better,"This was overall a good read, but I thought it was too predictable. Their espionage part on the Iron Fist went so smoothly with nearly no errors. Lara Nostil's identity wasn't dicovered. Two out of thirteen Wraiths died this time. I did like the way how the Wraiths infiltrated Iron Fist. The cameo appeareance by the 181st Imperial Tie Fighter was exciting.However the ending wasn't good in my opinion, you have a SSD on the run just because half it sheilds are gone? Anyway it looks from the events that happened in Iron Fist Allston next book ""Solo Command will be more action packed and dramatic."
4,The Greatest X-wing book thus far,The X-wing serries has always been my favorite section in the star wars novels. This X-wing book combinds humor and suspense in a way that it kept you intrested throughout the whole book. Aaron Allston has in my opinion been the first auther in the Star Wars novels to do this.
3,"A little wordy, and NO KELL!!!","This book was a little talkitive, and they suddenly switched the FACE doing the main character role. What happened to KELL!?! I miss him. I hope the next book will be better."
1,"pretty, but not purple or warm","I chose the Plum Rose Blanket as a lilac colored blanket for my daughters lilac and green bedroom, and it is much more of a rose/pink color than the picture displays. It is not very warm either. I have another vellux blanket and this feels very different and much thinner."
4,still awesome trio too,It seems they have done it again. great filler for berlin and bruford enthusiasts but kazumi played great. a bit light not as heavy as the first one but still worthy of praise. Jazz fusion but not as rowdy and eccentric.
1,WORTHLESS PIECE OF CRAPOLA,The tip split open after about 1 hour...total rip off. Couldn't submit this without a rating so I gave it a 1 star.....actually it should be -5 stars.
1,No use at all,"I ordered this nozzle and also a replacement gun. They sent me a hose instead of the gun. I sent it back and they promised me a replacement. They sent a hose AGAIN, but the second time, there was no prepaid shipping to return it. I called, but the call center person could not comprehend what my complaint was. In the end, I sent it all back, so now I have nothing to show except wasted time and trouble packing boxes, driving to the post office, and looking at convoluted bills trying to understand if the refunds were correct. Not a good experience."
1,"Junk, Junk, Junk!","crappy brittle plastic, bought 2 of them & both broke upon 1st use. Hopefully Amazon has dropped this item! junk!"
1,Lasted 2 minutes,Bought this with the gun and hose. Both products were ok but the connectors suck. They are made out of plastic (which is ok) but the plastic can't take the pressure and snapped in the first five minutes. This happened with two of the connectors. Went to Lowes and bought one with mainly metal parts.
1,Failed after 30 minutes,This turbo nozzle/wand worked fine for about 1/2 hour on my Black & Decker electric power washer. It cracked and stopped working..Returning it today.
2,Alright,"It's an alright program, for train lay out buffs. But if you want the real deal, like slowing down the flying scotsman before entering a station, real physics, and real routes. Then I suggest you go with MSTS, and ignore this simple program. There are hundreds of sites to download hundreds of new engines and routes, they only downside is that you have to create a consist for each new engine and car, but they have helpful tutorials to help you out, so I give this, 2 stars. Because of the simple control design. But, MSTS simulates the real thing, REAL engine controls, that need YOUR constent monitering. I'll probly get hateful reviews now."
3,"Strong magnet, faulty closure","I got this to store an extra house key on my property, should I lock myself out. I realized it wasn't the smartest idea to leave my windows unlocked to get in after my house was broken into this way.The magnet on this case is a good strong one, so I'm happy with that, but it's difficult to open and then I couldn't get it to close properly. I dropped it twice and the key flew out. I now have a rubber band wrapped around the end that opens (the magnet sticks out so the rubber band doesn't interfere with that). I also put it in a zip-locking bag, then wrapped more rubber bands around each end. The magnet is plenty strong enough to work with the plastic bag over it, but it's not exactly the slickest solution.If you can get this for pennies (including shipping) and don't mind rigging it to stay closed, it's worth it. Otherwise I'd look for something that stays closed."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzz,"I have many FIRM Videos, but was wanting a new routine.This particular video is slow, boring and despite what othershave written, it was WAY too easy. I'm an avid exerciser &would consider myself fit, but not at the elite level.If you like slower tempo and easier workouts, this willwork for you. Otherwise, SKIP IT!!"
3,Just a fib ...,My 10 year old daughter wanted this for Christmas. She played with her friends and the overall concensus was that it was just a fib. It wasn't as it appeared to them on the tv commercial. She and her friends thought the game could actually tell if you were fibbing or not. It also started several disagreements when it came up on fib and the girls were telling the truth. A very disappointing game.
2,Mildly entertaining,"My 8 year-old HAD to have this for Xmas but when she opened it, it was different than expected and her interest lasted about 6 minutes. She was disheartened to see that it is totally random in the ""lie detecting."" It's mildly entertaining but really just a battery-powered version of the good ole' Magic Eightball!"
5,I love this game!,"I bought this game myself, and I love it. It works by the heat in your finger. I know this because my friend had a cut in her finger, and so it's inner temperature was hot, and it always said she waas lying. The way you play is the peson to your right picks up a card and picks a question on it to ask you. You answer. If someone doesn't believe you, they ""challenge"" you. They do this be you putting your thumb on one side of the fib finder and they push down the botton on the other side. If it says your lying, they move up a level. If it says your telling the truth, though, they move down a level. First person to the top wins. I love this game and reccomend it to everyone."
3,Great for girls ages 8-12,"Of course this game can't actually tell whether you're lying or not, but that really seems to be of little importance! The greatest part about this game is just being able to ask your friends silly questions and giggle the night away. It's a fun, friendly game that doesn't get too personal in nature.On the other hand, if you're not 8-12 years of age, this game isn't going to be all that interesting."
2,Give me a break....,"Fib Finder? Ya right! I got this for my birthday party, and let me tell you this was incredibly stupid! I am not much of a lier, but this game said i was lieing every time i was asked a question- which isnt true!!! The only reason i gave this game 2 stars was because when you asked someone if they liked someone who you know they didnt like, but the Fib Finder said they did, it was funny. All in all, this toy isnt very educational, unless if you need to know that lieing is bad, and honesty is good. If you want a garbage game to laugh about, and have to money to pay for it go ahead and buy it. For people like me, DONT BUY THIS!!!"
3,Fibbing or Not???,"The Fib Finder game is great for kids of all ages! This toy teaches kids an important lesson: that somtimes, you'r lies will be found out! Though this game can never really know if your lying or not, it is fun just to play it. Just don't get too carried away, and however mad you get at the game, DO NOT drop it, hit it, or bang it on anything. It will not change it, and may break it permanatly or not! Over all, I rate this game mostly a 4 star toy. If your kid wants this game, I hope you can find it, because when I went, I got the last one on the shelve!"
3,Fib Finder-What a lie,"Okay, me and my friend, we were like at her house and her mom gave this to her and we were like, ""Yes!"" because we saw these totally hot commercials for the game. So we started to play, but the lie detector test thingy is soooooooo not accurate. It DOESN'T go in a pattern, like people say, but it goes b the warmth and wetness of your fingers. Okay, you could run a mile and be lying or have a pneumonia and always tell the truth, so it was dumb. But, we made uup our own game and she asked me if my uncle was an alien...I said NO but it said I was lying, that's why it was fun..."
1,Yuck!,"I was at a friend's party when she got Fib Finder.She got all excited and begged us to play but I did NOT because another girl at the party told me that the game had a pattern (it used truth 2 times in a row, then once it couldn't decide, then it used lie twice),and I beleived her. I watched the other girls play and saw that my friend was right! Even a rock would be more fun to play with,in my opinion! My summary is, KEEP AWAY FROM THIS GAME!"
5,my favorite hairspray,This hairspray has been my favorite for years. I'm so sorry that it has been discontinued and grateful that I was able to find a few more bottles.
3,EMERGANCY!!! Grandma needs hairspray!!!!!,"Grandma has been out of hairspray for months and looking all over town. Of course this is the only brand she has used forever and if she doesn't have it she goes without. She just recently mentioned this issue to me and I gave her a quick Kindle Amazon lesson & said ""I got it no worries I'm sure it will be here soon."" I went to my mailbox today & 3 ft away from my mailbox I already knew her hairspray had arrived. Needless to say the packaging was terrible. Thankfully just the screw top was loose & not too much of the product was gone & it is still usable. So now Grandma can roll her hair up for the family vacation!!! Go on Grandma!!"
5,Winner out of all the decorate book I bought,This book is so great. It gave me ideas for my kids room and the little under the sea theme for the bathroom.
3,A PIECE OF ARCHIVEABLE HISTORY,"Concurrently illustrated in English, German, and French languages, ""Curious Moments"" is a collection of some of the most fascinating twentieth century photographs. It is a bunch of riddles: both sadness and joy. But above all, it is candid. Every picture in this 720-paged photo-book tells a different story. They are real, refreshing, and well-documented. They are indeed, the gap between everyday life and world affairs.""Curious Moments"" is a product of collective effort: from several photojournalists. It spanned across the continents of the world, and covered the first 67 years of the 20th Century. It is a collection of laughing photos. A piece of archiveable history!"
3,Basic,Not bad for an old vintage take on Hitler. Doesn't quite due justice to the conditions in Germany and how Hitler made the situation better before his insanity took hold.
4,Trunk Music - Review,"I enjoyed reading the book Trunk Music. I had read earlier and later Harry Bosch books but I found this one to be up to Michael Connelly's usual high standard. An excellent read, great characters, enough twist and turns, and he tied it neatly together at the end."
3,"Uneven pacing, still good","This entry in the Harry Bosch series isn't the strongest, but it's still pretty good. It starts with a mob-style hit and leads to Las Vegas, where the story gets bungled up in typical mob drollery. Not until the feds and mobsters start falling off to the side and the second half of the book starts, does Trunk Music pick up steam and lead to an interesting conclusion.Unlike the previous two books in the series, there isn't a lot of introspection and character building. Trunk Music, is a straight out cop book."
4,Harry Misreads the Clues,"Michael Connelly does something unusual in Trunk Music: He makes Harry Bosch fallible in his work as well as in his private life. The result is that Harry has setbacks that go beyond his usual run-ins with LAPD authority. The result is entertaining and convoluted, providing novelty to this excellent series.This isn't my favorite in the series by a long shot. The noir aspects just aren't as dark as in Connelly's best efforts.Gallows humor saves the book, beginning with finding a corpse in a car trunk where the crime scene can be seen from the audience at the Hollywood Bowl. Even Harry knows that he's got to avoid messing up the concert. The show must go on!The Las Vegas parts of the story open up many new threads for future tales, including a meeting in this book with an old friend from The Black Echo."
2,Cliche and derivative.,"I bought this book because I saw it in the bargain bin at Barnes and Nobles. I was looking for something light to read (having just finished a dense, difficult read). I found it pretty dull. It relied on a long tradition of LA detective cliches, but it didn't do anything new with them. The story was slowly paced and the characters were about as stock as you can get....""the sleazy b-movie director with ties to the mob"", ""the washed up actress trophy wife"", the ""depressed hooker from Las Vegas who really just wants another shot..."" cmon...."
2,No surprises here!,"Another bad cop killing his lovers spouse with the spouse orchestrating from the sidelines. A plot Connelly has used more than once.In all, if you look at it stand alone from the others in the series, it is well done. Good characterizations, good dialogue, but well worn plot.It is readable, however."
5,Michael Connelly is the greatest,Connelly never fails to develop a great story line to support his intense characters. I have been waiting for DeMille to come out with a new great novel and in the mean time I discovered Connelly. He hasn't failed my expectations and is a great read if you like DeMille.
5,Half a school of red herrings,"Harry Bosch is back from an ""involuntary stress leave,"" and his first case is clearly a mob hit. The trail seeems to a case-closed sure as shooting guilty party -- until it turns out he's an FBI mole with an iron alibi. The list of who Connelly's up agains tin this story goes from the real killers to the FBI to Internal Affairs to a long lost love. This is one of his toughtest cases, but Bosch always pulls through.Connelly's books seem a lot like Chander in their noir exploration of corruption and sordid seamy scenarios, but Bosch is less cynical and less ""sexy"" than Marlowe. Still, the series is entertaining and satisfying."
4,"here's to Harry Bosch,","Michael Connelly makes Harry Bosch so realistic you feel like he's someone you have known for a long time, but just not on a totally intimate basis. The settings in the Los Angeles area are so authentic, you can almost see and taste the atmosphere. A truly ""good read"" and keeps you wanting more about ""Harry""."
2,Filler,I might have considered giving this book three stars if I hadn't read The WiFi Mystery. If it wasn't for the redundant dialogues this book should have been 200 hundred-page leaner. I would recommend readers to check out the other book I mentioned and compare.
4,"Same old Harry, New Direction!","Michael Connelly has a talent for keeping my favorite detective (Harry Bosch) fresh and constantly in new directions and this one is no different. It is a novel where it seems several times that the case is closed but since there are alot of pages remaining, the reader knows its not. Harry is his same brash self, whether he is mouthing off to IAD and other police brass, throwing himself into unwise romantic liaisons or fighting with mob guys. This book introduces Kiz Rider, who along with Edgar team with Harry for a few succeeding books. And I almost forgot Lieutenant Bullets, I mean Billets."
5,Best of the bunch,If you are a Connelly fan - this is a must read. The characters and the author are at their top form.
4,Harry's at it again,"Once again, Michael Connelly's favorite Detective is at it again. He defies authority and has great faith in his partners and solves the case without authorization of his bosses. Great read and excellent story line."
5,A good cast,The author did a fine job of developing all the main characters.A very smart crime with just enough violence to keep me interested.
4,a good read!,"I like the way this book explains some of the terms used in law enforcement. Some detective books fail to do that. Anyway, this book was so vividly descriptive that it was like watching a movie. Like what the other reveiwers said, it moved quickly and had a group of very interesting characters."
4,An eye-opening look into Vegas & Hollywood via a mystery.,"I'm following the Michael Connelly canon backwards. ""Trunk Music"" is the first book of his I read and it spurred me on to the others. Mystery writers seem to have difficulty maintaining their ""zone"". Often their efforts fall into an easily discernable pattern and the reader wonders whether or not they draw up a plot outline and just keep writing books around it. Connelly has great flexibility and creativity and, as he showed in ""The Poet"", the ability to create a whole new character and make him interesting. I loved this book and the excitement it created during the many plot twists. Attention Patricia Cromwell: This is how it is done"
3,Harry goes to Vegas,"Engaging story. Typical Harry at work. Up against all odds, Las Vegas Police, FBI, and the Mob, Harry stays true to his mission once more. All the suspence and the usual amount of twists and turns. But an avid Bosch reader might be able to spot the vilain within the first thirty pages as I did. That is not the norm for Mr.Connelly who usualy does a better job hidding the adversaryStill good and a worthwhile follow up of his previous novels."
4,Not the best by a long shot...,"This is probably Connelly's weakest Bosch novel (I have read the first 5 and the Narrows, so I have 4 more to go)...I loved the end and the geniunely shocking twists and turns (first about 1/2 way through and the second about 15 pages from the end). Billets and Rider are super new characters. However, the plot was meandering and overly complicated. How many IAD investigations/suspensions is Harry going to deal with? And the plot was not overly exciting or engaging. Still, it is Bosch and Connelly is probably the best mystery writer going to day."
3,"Good enough to keep reading, yet disappointing","Reading this book, I kept reading to find out whodunnit of course. What I didn't realize was that my suspicions of whodunnit were right from the very beginning. I guess if you read enough murder mysteries, you sort of begin to pick up on the clues that make the story predictable. When things are coincidental, there is probably a reason. When something begins to make sense and fall in place too easily, there is probably a reason. I found the new police characters to be refreshing but tired of the IA inquiry, the boring and rambling dialogues throughout the book and the Harry Bosch greater than thou character. I wouldn't recommend the book. Once you know who the killer(s) really are, the book struggles along and stretches out the story another 75 pages or so that aren't necessary and I felt at the end I should've seen the words, ""And they all lived happily ever after""."
4,"A good Harry Bosch story, hopefully the last.","I've now read an thoroughly enjoyed all of Michael Connelly's novels. The Harry Bosch series is especially good, with believable police department intrigue.However, the Bosch stories are getting a bit formulaic and predictable, so I hope this one marks the end of the series, at least for a long while.Bloodwork, Connelly's most recent effort was excellent and I look forward to other characters he will bring to life in the future."
4,Great story line bogs down with onerous detail and dialog,"Another great Connelly story that is made unnecessarily tedious to read by the use of too much dialog and minute detail. When one asks someone what time it is they don't really want to hear the details of how a watch is constructed! I think Connelly got so wrapped up in his research that he wanted us all to know how much time he spent learing the lingo, etc. However, all this said, Connelly is still one of the better story tellers out there (see John Sandford's works for another excellent example), and this novel is still a top notch read....just hard to follow if you are sleepy!!"
1,"Harry Bosch, holier-than-thou","This was the third book I've read by Connelly, and the one that finally made me cry ""Enough!"" The plot, like all the others, is pinned to betrayal in high places, with enough red herrings thrown in to force the evacuation of a fish pier and keep one off-balance. But the character of Bosch, sheesh. He started out decent enough, but becomes in ""Trunk Music"" even more self righteous than the good cop delivering a lecture on a bad TV series. When he finally pitches his coup de grace to one of his (many) ""tormentors,"" (noone's as smart or good as Harry) part of me wanted the ""bad guy"" to jump up and eloquently defend himself against the raving lunatic. Ah well."
3,"Great Character, over engineered story","Anyone who has read Harry Bosch novels will have that character familiarity which gives an anticipation to new installments. I approached this book with relish but was strangely indifferent in the end.Here Bosch is investigating a murder where a body is found in a mafia style hit in a car trunk. This leads him to Vegas, an old flame and to various off-the-books investigative techniques for which the character is known & loved.However, Connelly looses his way a bit in this book. The plot twists and turns constantly to a contrived and heavy handed crescendo. In the end, I felt that the actual murder & characters involved presented a far more interesting plot that that pursued for much of the novel.Angel's FLight is for my money a better read."
4,Another great book in the Harry Bosch series,"A really great series. Well written and atmospheric. The characters are believable, flawed and therefore interesting. A good crime novel."
3,A traditional Harry Bosch book,"A dead body is discovered, which becomes a murder. Harry goes through the usual rebellions towards authority and does his thing while harrassed by internal affairs and also involving his partners in his off the rail doings. But, no fear, he'll take all the responsibility. Of course, he solves the murder in the end and all is forgiven."
5,Trunk Music,"I particularly enjoy Michael Connelly's books. I am keen to read mystery/action books. His novels are challenging, gripping and most enjoyable."
2,Great to have Harry back!,Was happy to get another Bosch novel. The book had some interesting twists and turns to it and kept me wanting to keep reading!
2,to much of the same,If you read one Harry Bosch then the other follow in the same format. I will not buy another harry Bosch
4,Trunk Music,I guess I'm hooked on Harry Bosch. I just got into this series by Michael Connelly and am looking forward to purchasing the next one!
4,A very solid mystery,"At times in Trunk Music, it's difficult to fathom Harry Bosch's motivations - but this is because Michael Connelly has made him a palpable, real character - with his own murky stew of agendas and impulses.Trunk Music is an entertaining blend of mystery, moving between a domestic and a mafia plotline at a dizzying speed. The twists, when they come, are great. Hints happen at times, but in general I was caught by surprise. Perhaps there's something too pat about the ending, but the novel on the whole is an enjoyable, exciting ride.Connelly has a real skill in drawing characters, flowing from his gifts at observation. He allows litle details to make their ways through. The result is a lifelike depiction of a murder investigation.I read this out of sequence with the other Bosch novels and found it comprehensible. Still, I think there might be benefits to tackling these in order - not huge ones, but appreciable ones. Either way, you'll enjoy Trunk Music"
3,"Compare to ""Poet"" seems like a dissapointment","""The Poet"" was my first book by Michael Connelly. It as awsome. I thought all of his books were as suspensful and interesting as ""The Poet"". I bought ""The Trunk Music"" and it was a dissapointment. The plot was unfolding very slow. It was full of unneseccary boring dialogs and lacked that marvelous suspense force that keeps you interested and read further. ""Blood Work"" is much, much better."
5,Hard to put down!,"Another book in the Connelly series that reinforces my goal of reading all of the Harry Bosch books. I love Connelly's writing style: a great story line plus lots of ""head knowledge"" along the way."
3,Trunk Music,"Book is an easy read, Nothing particularly good or bad about it. Not really a compelling mystery-your typical detective story."
3,Didn't razzle - dazzle me!,"A good story, great characters, but after the Poet I was a wee bit forlorn!"
4,Short Review,It was another entertaining Harry Bosch. I would not rate this as one of the best but it was a good read.
1,I've read better material in teen magazine,"This novel was one of the worst, most predictable, pieces of filth that I have ever had the displeasure of reading. From the begginning you knew who the killers were, and Harry Bosch is a charachter that could easily be erased."
4,Gwyneth Shines,"The movie was a somewhat cliche coming of age love story, and even though shallow, it is not unlike the real life versions of first love/crush. What I most like about this movie is the character Estrella, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. She exemplifies that freshly blossoming beauty of a young woman. Her nude modeling scene is a movie classic in the ""Lolita"" vein of Jane Fonda, Sharon Tate, Bridget Bardot and other beautiful actresses through time."
4,Remake or not...It's a Gwyneth Palthrow tour-de-force,"I'm not going to claim that I have seen the original, nor remember reading the boring novel in literature class, but I did see this DVD. This movie is exceptional, stylish, and captivating. Ethan Hawke is brilliant, as the son of a poor handyman, who falls hard for the daughter of a bitter, old wealthy widow(played exceptionally by Anne Bankroft). The real show-stealer is Gwyneth Palthrow, the object of Hawke's affections, as an iceberg princess, incapable of love or emotion. This film shows that no matter what success we achieve in life, it is all hollow without the affections of those we care about most."
2,"very nice cinematography, but a big hole in the story","I went to see this movie cause I like Ethan Hawke ( I was expecting he'd maybe do as well as in Reality Bites), and cause other recent adaptions of classics set in our time turned out to be great (Rome& Juliet), but the story of this one is just empty. The cinematography of the film is great, as well as the artwork and music, but that doesn't really make a good movie, does it!?"
1,The worst movie (except for The Avengers) of the year,"This adaption is totally worthless. Now I'm all for setting classics in other time periods, but why completely ruin the story? This version is completely boring. Estella is nowhere bitchy enough, Pip/Fynn is just a fawning idiot and god knows what Anne Bancroft is doing. The music is pretty good though, and Haversham's house is pretty cool, but otherwise, YUCK!"
5,Dickens for the 1990's,"Ah... I love this movie. Now that Gwyneth Paltrow is finally getting the recognition that she deserves, her new fans must check out this film. I had my doubts about whether or not a modern adaptation of a Dickens novel would be worth making. Believe me, this one is."
4,A TRULY BEAUTIFUL FILM!!!!!,The reason I actually wanted to see the movie in the first place was because Robert De Niro is my favorite actor and Gwen Paltrow looked sizzling hot in the trailer. When I got through 30 minutes of the movie I was captivated. This beautiful film is so artisticly crafted and told. Great Expectations is great.
4,"Clever, creative, well done, but not a masterpiece","The concept is simple:1. Transform the British Classic from Charles Dickens into an American story2. Transform this classic into modern times.Overall I would say, very clever, and at least partially successful.Many of the actors work very well. The sound and music is great. Many scenes are beautiful.For me, somewhat slow paced, did not always work, perhaps could have been better conceived.I liked the movie, enjoyed many scenes, and was impressed with some of the actors and sound/music. This is a movie to watch."
3,Different from the book,"If you liked the book, you probably wouldn't enjoy this movie that greatly. There was a great deviation from the novel by Charles Dickens. However, I think Ethan Hawke and Gwyneth Paltrow had a lot of chemistry and they showed that to the audience through the movie."
2,"Great Expectations, indeed...the ones that don't materialize","This film has virtually nothing to offer. Robert De Niro is out of place (as much as I value his talent). Hawke is kind of weird, especially in his badly executed ""teenage"" look. The New York's Art Scene is highly irritating, as is the ""eccentric aunt"" most of the times. I think Paltrow's nude picture on the cover helped to promote this film."
4,Loved the soundtrack...,"I enjoyed this modern retelling of the story. Anne Bancroft was wonderful, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ethan Hawk turned in good performances. I found Ehtan Hawk's performanace a little flat, but I always think his performances are a little flat. I loved the soundtrack. There were several good versions of Beseme Mucho, unfortunately the soundtrack album only has one of these. I am also disappointed that this film doesn't seem to be coming out on DVD."
1,"It Aint Dickens, It Aint Sexy, It Aint Good","This film prizes beauty -- and rather vapid, sexless beauty at that -- over narrative cohesion or strucutre. The kind of film a foreign audience might like, since it's light on dialogue on heavy on lush, overwrought, pretentious and simple-minded imagery, GREAT EXPECTATIONS fetishizes its skinny, pale movie stars like a fashion magazine. See this director's magical LITTLE PRINCESS, and shun this studio atrocity. One happy note though: ETHAN HAWKE has never looked better."
1,a mockery of a brilliant classic!,"I found this movie an atrocious violation to Dicken's work. The book was magnificient, and for the most part, it would have worked well in modern times. But the director just down right ruined the film...not to mention the actiing was really bad! I curious to know how many people who gave this movie 5 stars actually read the book..."
3,Lowered Expectations,"For some inexplicable reason, the film makers took the plot line from the great Dickens' masterpiece, gave it a remarkably luminous cinematography, and then proceeded to completely strip out emotional resonance of the original story, so that they end up with a mere pretty postcard of a movie. Given the title and likewise high expectations on my part, I was very disappointed."
1,Not what I expected,My students read Great Expectations and then I wanted to show a movie of the book as a reward. This was not it. This movie has nothing to do with the book except is shares a title. I could see nothing similiar and the language etc was so bad I coulnd't show my AP seniors this movie. I am very disappointed. The tags they suggest are Dickens and classic. It is neither of these. Its trash.
2,A film that misses the point of its title,"This movie attempts to recreate Great Expectations in a modern context but fails in every important way. It turns a fascinating study of desire and self discovery into a generic on again off again love story. While it has scenes from the book they all fall flat because they lack their original purpose and character. As such, the movie lacks charm and gravitas during its most important scenes. One scene undermines another as the work to make a character's action have meaning is not done. It fails to reach any emotional highs and seems to be content to make a hollow recreation of a greater story. It does not succeed in either making its own original story, or telling the story its name implies."
5,great movie,"one of my favorite movies....it's an undated variation of an old story, but done much better than romio and juliet. it's still simple to understand and thought provoking."
4,An interesting modern take on a classic,"An interesting modern take on a classic - not the same as reading the classic, but we enjoyed the movie."
4,Underrated Movie,"Great performances and excellent pacing make this movie a must watch for DeNiro, Hawke, and Paltrow fans. Chris Cooper is also wonderful."
2,Hallmark channel meets pseudo-erudite art world/unrequited love,"This film overall is maudlin, over-wrought, completely unbelievable and basically God-awful. With the minor exception of some decent cinematography. Ms Paltrow's character appears to have borderline personality disorder, which does nothing to add to the movie's appeal. Should she lose 3 more pounds, she would surely qualify for an anorexia diagnosis. Her nude appearance is the only reason this film got any attention whatsoever as it is unfortunately Lifetime Move Network quality over a Sundance veneer."
4,Beautiful,"Beautiful cinematography! This movie is highly underrated and would make for an excellent Blu Ray, which surprisingly doesn't exist as of yet. Yes, the movie takes away from the book, however, as a film, it works perfectly; from the acting, to the music, and the images of green."
2,Love Story,"This adaptation of Charles Dickens` novel is an interesting watch, but the final result isn`t too engaging or surprising. Another variation on the old poor boy (Ethan Hawke, in another of his dreamer, innocent, young artist roles) that falls for the rich girl (Gwyneth Patrow, with a too wooden and bland performance). Director Alfonso Cuarón presents some stylish and gourgeous sceneries, locations, people and music, yet the plot is still by-the-numbers, failing to convince despite some pretty and well-crafted moments. Not a bad movie, but not a memmorable one either.Passable entertainment."
1,Yawn,"As my one-line summary says, I thought this movie was boring. I was very disappointed in it. I didn't care for the character Gwyneth was portraying. And I've never seen any star quality in Ethan Hawke."
1,"great cast , weak plot , adismal movie","i didn't like this movie. it was boring , unrealistic , and stupid."
3,Beatiful movie-I love green too,"I am ashamed to tell that I have not read the book, hopefully I will. But I liked this movie, it is beautiful and sensual. The plot is about a poor boy who falls in love with cold beautiful rich girl living with her eccentric aunt. She breaks his heart, but he is lucky enough to be a famous artist after being sponsored by an ex criminal becoming rich whom he helped when he was a kid.I watched it as a love story though some moral is hinted (I believe the book has more philosophy and morals)The atmosphere is so captivating with greens, the crazy aunt, the kids dancing, the super music, the beautiful sketches, that one does not care if this is a sensible movie with well constructed characters and supporting dialogues. Well, it is not, anyway...Finally, here goes a beautiful movie, a delight to watch and listen especially if you like romance. A must [see]"
3,"good ""great expectations"" for the 90's...","This movie was a little weird but it was good. This is one of those movies where you have to listen and not be interrupted. Ethan Hawk is great and Gweneth Paltrow is a great Estelle. This movie adds something to the original ""Great Expectations"" that Charles didn't have. This movie was also, like I said before, a little weird form beginning to end. And Estelle, even at a young age, is a girl who plays hard-to-get with Finn. But this movie is good. Robert DeNiro is also very good. So get this movie but don't have ""great expectations"" to be blown away."
1,"Pretty to look at, but a real let down!","The cinematographer does a great job, but the screenplay's dramatic choices deflate Dickens' original intentions. In this version, the two romantic leads have not suffered enough by the time the end arrives. The result is that the plot's final pay-off offers only a tiny fraction of what Dickens delivered in his novel.I was keenly disappointed and irritated because the director had done such a wonderful job with ""The Little Princess."" Like most movies nowadays, the screenplay is the weak link."
1,Piece of Crap,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. If your thinking about watching it to help you understand or get some of Dickens work in a visual, then watch the old black and white Great Expectations movie. not this one. the older movie is more accurate, this movie is all over the place. AND even if someone decided to watch this movie just to watch it, then go find something else because this movie is just baddd. It should be 50cents not $2.99"
2,Disappointing,"Not impressive, although I believed in the cast I found the film boring and artifical. The actors I actually bought the film for were Ann Bancroft and Gwyneth Paltrow - they were OK but lacked depth; Ethan Hawke looked like he was still in High School and Robert de Niro was dressed up as Fagin in the muscial Oliver. A waste of money as far as I am concerned."
3,Sensual but confusing.,"Great Expectations starring Ethan Hawke and Gwyneth Paltrow is a sexy film but the fault doesn't lie with the actors but rather with story. The two stars have never been better, their chemistry is intoxicating and that scene at the drinking fountain, can you say hot, hot, hot! Some of the dialogue seems forced and the direction is somewhat awkward. Robert De Niro and Anne Bancroft have the strangest roles in this film and don't expect an exact interpretation of the Charles Dicken's classic. The ending is what saves the film, give this movie a viewing."
5,Beautiful,"I like this movie for so many reasons-- the music is haunting, the scenery is beautiful, the paintings by Orozco are inspiring. Not to mention great modern adaptation, and some fabulous performances by all, particularly Anne Bancroft. You can't go wrong."
5,Great Expectations...the movie,"I thought the movie was wonderful. It had passion and romance and suspense. The charachters especially play an awsome part in the movie. I recommend this to anyone needing to rent a movie, also, read the book by either Dicken's or Chiel. They are both fantastic. I LOVE YOU ANDREW HART:)"
2,Gweneth gets naked,The only reason I went to see this film is to see Gweneth Paltrow get naked. It is worth it for that reason only. The script was terrible and Robert DeNiro was a disappointment.
4,Great movie - bad language,"This was a great story & Matt Damon, Will Smith, & especially the little boy gave outstanding performances. However, I was disappointed by the unnecessary use of foul language."
1,Not Worth Your Time or Money,"This is a movie that was so overhyped because of Robert Redford's envolvement in the project that all common sense regarding good taste was apparently forgotten. I was really annoyed with the Will Smith character of Bagger Vance, I thought I was watching some 1930's Uncle Tom's Cabin out-takes.Hollywood can do so much better...."
2,Like a Putt That Juuussssstt Misses.....,"Too bad. Thoughtful direction, novel story and a solid, attractive trio of stars. But this overwrought, over-scored, over-messaged movie misses the mark...and it's tough to finger the culprit(s).No, it isn't Theron's woefully bad Southern dialect or Bagger's corny dialogue. It isn't the allegory heaped upon allegory or Jack Lemmon's ""grumpy old man"" cameo.Whatever it is, this is ultimately a film for fans of the celebrity cast members, director or the game of golf. Trip Hamilton and Joel Gretsch do deserve mention for their standout supporting roles. However, your two hours will probably be better spent going to the driving range."
1,Helped to put me to sleep!,"The only reason this movie deserved even one star was that it can help a hopeless insomniac to fall asleep. This movie was boring, boring, boring! I don't think this movie could have been more predictable. To rent this movie is a waste of money, to buy this movie is pure stupidity! I am a big fan of Will Smith as well as Matt Damon .. but am very surprised they chose to take part in this film. Boo to Robert Redford, I expected more from him."
4,Fighting Against Our Inner Demons,"Lot of times we need to seek our ""swing"" or retrieve a lost one. Many times too, we need someone to help us find it. The movie is not about golf but about rediscovering oneself and let go of all the demons hiding in us. A good movie."
5,Extremely inspiring and attention grabbing; draws you in,"This movie was so incredibly inspiring, I find it hard to put it into words. I'm not a natural athelete. I don't like golf, don't know anything about golf, and don't care about golf, but for two hours I did. Will Smith was a standout as Bagger Vance, although after watching it I didn't think the title quite described the film. Charlize Theron was exceptional as Adele Invergordon, Matt Damon's stunning love interest. And of course Matt Damon put on a fantastic performance of Rannulph Junnuh. I will be sure to watch this enthralling movie again and again."
2,Very Lopsided,"After the first 30 minutes I was ready to turn it off when Will Smith came on screen and saved it. After having lived in the South for two years, the southern accents came off as painfully unconvincing -- Hey Charlize, think you could try holding the accent for the ENTIRE sentence?! And the dialogue, who the hell wrote this, Robert James Waller? The biggest groaner, from an anonymous man on the street: ""God Bless Savannah and the men she propagates!"" Every character in the film speaks in godawful Hollywood-Southernisms; storms are always ""a brewin'"" and Charlize says 'ah declayuh!' --It's as if the screenwriters copped the dialect from Foghorn Leghorn and that 'Gone With the Wind' episode of Bugs Bunny. But even with this tortured dialogue, Will Smith's charm shined through. And after a while, the dialogue is kind of fun to rip on."
4,Impressive,"The Legend of Bagger Vance really touched. The symbolism and hidden meanings in the movie were numerous, making the viewer really reflect on his or her own life. All of sometimes fell as if we have lost our ""Authentic Swing"" at sometime or another. We would all be blessed if a Bagger Vance (played by Will Smith)would help us find it again. Robert Redford did a fine job in selecting the cast for this movie. Bagger should have had more scenes in between the golf tournament but the character was still solid. Matt Damon proved once again in this movie that he is one of the best talents in the acting profession today. Overall, this is the real deal. May even have oscar potential."
4,Legend of baggy pants,"Bobby Jones has baggy pants in this movie. Well, baggy knickers. But an down-and-out Captain Junah (played by Matt Damon) is recruited to play in a golf tournament with the best golfers in the world. The guy from MacGuyver plays the other golfer. The quality of the golf in this movie is good, Will Smith does a great job, and the movie has good pace and enough mix of humor and drama to make it worth watching. The transfer on this DVD is excellent, and so is the sound. All in all a worthwhile DVD."
5,Classic,"This was an old movie, but had some of my son's favorite actors in it, so I decided to try it and I'm glad I did. He loved this story."
1,boring snoozefest is the least insulting thing about this,If anyone has ever seen the uncle toms cabin from the 30's then you will recognize it as what will smith's charecter is based on.I am actually shocked they can get away with this kind of racism in this day and age
1,Worthless movie,"This movie is probably the most worthless movie I have ever seen. I guess they were relate golf to life. It didn't work. The most irritating part of the movie was Bagger Vance (Will Smith). This bagger guy appears in the movie, says some spritual garbage about a golf swing, and then leaves the movie without ever hinting as to who he is. This movie is a perfect way to waste two hours."
2,"Movie about golf, but was trying to be something else!","Regardless of what Robert Redford was trying to accomplish with this movie, it just turns out to be a movie about golf amoungst the setting of the great depression. It tries to be mystical and mysterious, but with sloppy cuts from scene to scene, and a poor plot, this movie falls apart early. Will Smith plays a character which should be hosting a show like Oprah, with all his deep thoughts on life. I became bored with that character within about two minutes. I don't know if it was just bad acting, a bad script, or both, but this movie was pretty pathetic. The only thing I liked about this movie was the sporting sequences where they actually were playing golf. If this movie was just about that without the lame story behind it, it whould have been much better. My suggestions is to rent this, if even that."
1,worst movie so far of 2000,"This movie has a bad script and bad directing. Part of the movie has the mic running into the actors and the rest of it is just a joke. ""A man's grip on his club is like his grip on his world."" Why? ""what did you like about us,"" ""I liked the way we danced."" Is that it. When you aren't laughing at the dramatic scenes, you are laughing at the moronic lines. Matt Damon and Will Smith made a poor choice in picking to act in this movie. Don't see this movie."
1,Painful to watch,"Who would have thought with this cast that the movie would be as horrendously horrible and unbearable to watch as it was. I honestly thought it was one of the worst movies I have seen. Everybody is trying WAY too hard to make this 'artful', 'magical', etc. In the end, it was about 4 hours longer than I wanted to spend watching it. I definately do not recommend it unless you are looking for a good snooze. I like Damon, Smith, and Theron (normally), and I LOVE golf, but this was just way over-the-top of cheesy, horrible movie-making. Painful and embarrassing for such a fine cast to have made this movie."
1,Redford should stick to acting..BORING,"Robert Redford shows you some beautiful sceanery. Will Smith and Matt Damon do their best. But this film was put together so shoddy I cant beleive it. Microphones appear everywhere throughout this film. If your depressed and need some inspiration though shallow as it is go see this film. Robert Redford gets an ""F"" for editing. You loose the magic of the film when you see microphones dangling around. The theaters already pulled this one from their screens. Wait for Blockbuster."
5,Spectacular,"This is undeniably the greatest golf movie ever. The story is fantastic, involving the great depression, Bobby Jones and a war hero(played exceptionally by Matt Damon). However, the best part of this spectacular film is the acting. I love Will Smith as Bagger Vance, and with Matt Damon as the main protagonist and Charlize Theron as Ms. Idelle Envagordon, you simply cannot lose. If you love golf and movies, see this one."
1,Weak Film Adaptation... Misses Vital Elements of the Book,"This video would rate higher if there were no novel. If you enjoyed the novel, however, you will be sorely disappointed in this adaptation. There are two many missing plot lines to list, but the video comes across as a very one dimential show. The Charlize Theron charactor, who is barely in the book, is expanded into a main love interest, seemingly to ""normalize"" the Junah charactor. This fails miserably, as the only time Theron is even remotely interesting is during while she is stripping. Matt Damon appears way too young as the Junah charactor is supposed to have already played on a golf tour, fought in WWI for several years, been married & fathered a daughter, and travelled around Europe for several years after the war. In conclusion, there are worse movies out there, but there may not be a worse movie adaptation of a great novel."
5,Review of the Book,The service of ordering and receiving the book was good. However I was disapointed with the book. It wasn't at all what I expected from the book.
4,The Legend of Bagger Vance,"One of the best of its kind: It's historical, funny, one of Matt Damon and Will Smith's best performances, and the last of Jack Lemmon's movie performances. Set in the midst of the Great Depression, the story reflects the how the main character, Junah, must come in terms of his post-WWI trauma and regain his standard in the game of golf. The man who assists in this journey is a caddy named Bagger Vance, played by Will Smith, as he directs Junah in confronting his demons and learns to use his talent on the golf course in the midst of competition. Great direction of film by Robert Redford. (The subject of racism is downplayed)"
4,Gorgeous Cinematography,"This might not have broken box office records, but the Legend of Bagger Vance was a beautifully filmed movie. Capt Rannulph Junnuh learns to get his swing back and shakes his survivor's guilt with the help of a young fan, a lost love and a mysterious caddy.Watch for the scenes at twilight by the water. The sunsets are gorgeous. I think this is cinematographer Michael Ballhaus's greatest work. Great story telling. Great acting. Excellent editing and score. Visually appealing."
5,Good Movie,Another good movie that make you think outside the box. Just what are the chances of things like this happening in ours lives.
4,legend of bagger vance,"We really liked the movie. We had seen it when it 1st came out and it was a real treat to see it again, like most movies you miss something the 1st time"
2,Three fundamental problems...,"1. Matt Damon has a poor swing.2. Will Smith is not old enough for the role.2a. What part of the South was this colorblind in the 20s and 30s?3. From the end of WWI to the beginning of the story arc, Junuh gets hammered and stays that way, living on biscuits and squirrel stew or whatever, in his abandoned manse. But once he's rescued and polished up a bit, neither he nor Charlize Theron's character seem to have aged in the least since 1919.If stuff like that doesn't bother you, you'll have a blast. If it does bother you, well...the golf scenes with the Hagen and Jones characters are still technically accurate and beautifully executed, the golf course itself should be listed during the opening credits, and Charlize Theron chews on the scenery with obvious gusto and enjoyment."
3,Will is gifted like this movie,"Will Smith is gifted in his work.This movie shows that he has alot of talent.Better than WildWild West.LOL.I see great acting in this man.We all know Matt is great.I liked this movie very much andMy wife hated it.She said it wasstupid.I totally do not agree..Great work and great movie..If you like Will Smith and MattDamon,then don't delay in gettingthis movie. Will Smiths best work. Damon hasdone better.Every ingrediant that makes agreat movie was in here."
3,If you like golf and feel-good-pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps movies,Not a movie that you have to have to complete your Matt Damon or Will Smith collections but a decent film. It's predictable and trite at times but your wife will enjoy watching it with you.
1,Overcooked,"Not sure of direction of movie...muddled with confusing mix of ""Zen"", ""Golf"", and ""Life Journey""...Will Smith definetly not able to carry-off role of a ""fuzzy"" spiritual guide (Morgan Freeman type would have been much more effective)...Hard to ""buy"" package that Matt Damon's problems could all be worked out between Hole #1 and Hole #18...I did find three redeeming factors...Beautiful scenery, ""Bobby Jones"" golf swing, and young boys enthusiastic and energetic acting performance..."
1,Slow Play Ruins Golf,"Matt Damon has a terrible swing and I would like a match with him if he reads this...Anytime, anywhere. Not only poor swing mechanics, but he, his playing partners and the whole movie take forever to play out shots. This may have been acceptable with a more compelling story, with major plot points explained or with chemistry among any of the actors. But in this case a 2 stroke penalty is in order. Sadly this film was one of Jack Lemon's last pictures, and one he should have never laced up his spikes for. Damon's southern accent sounded like Denzel Washington, and Will Smith and Charlize Theron also play over par. I've heard the book is a great read. Golf is difficult enough without having to put so much effort into this tale.Michael Durankowww.bootism.com"
4,Pleased with product and service,The book arrived in a timely manner in the exact condition it was advertised to be. Thanks so much for the prompt and efficient service!
4,"Going green is good, but there are some drawbacks","This is a good seasonal solution to the overnight icing that happens on windshields during the winter. I work nights, and when I go home at 2 or 3 in the morning, the last thing I want to do is get out the scraper and scrape off the ice, snow or hard frost on a cold windshield. I got this knowing that it would be better for our environment than some of the methanol products available. This stuff performs quite well. Granted you do have to spritz a little more than you would the other products. Plus I like using the non-aerosol, which gives you more control and uses less product than the others, which can shoot across your car to the next one.The only issue I had with this product is that it left a grit on the windshield and sometimes caused streaking. The salt base is most likely the cause for this and is bearable if you want to continue to use something more environmentally friendly."
3,"Soft, light, but not altogether uncompelling.","This is a harder, faster ""Air"" which remains refreshingly mild by the overbearing electronic standard. Most tracks have only a midway-intrusive beat, which gives the listener a welcome choice to zone it out. Alas, some tracks reek of forced electronic emotion, but I s'pose that can be a good thing. 'Tis very listenable but no standout."
2,If you like adult contemporary...,"Then this is the cd for you. There's this thin line between jazzy drum and bass and Kenny G influenced ""music"" and Myerson crossed it. Adam F treads water but is still the man. Jaime Myerson is like Goldie and Yanni hanging out..."
4,PROPAGANDHI,"one of the greatest canadian punk bands ever. excellent album. some ""skankers"" might get offended by ""Ska Sucks"" so beware. check out the weakerthans, a propagandhi side project featuring jon-jon, but not punk..more poppy, and ""Elliot Smith"". check it out. lates."
5,Most of their best songs are on here,If someone says NOFX sucks its safe to say they suck. Ska Sucks is one of their best songs and there are lot of other great songs on here to boot. I bet this moron listens to Fallout Boy.
2,Large Disapointment,"This cd sucks. They are total ripoffs of NOFX (and NOFX sucks) and appear to put no effort into most of their songs. They all sound the same, the drummer sucks, and the vocals are stereotypically bad. The back cover of their ""funny"" faces is lame and makes me ashamed to own this. At least I didn't pay for it. I do like Anti-Manifesto though."
1,this band is gay,"I hate this band so much. This band is stupid as can be. I mean this cd, and this band are just so bad."
3,Not Their Best,"I'll say this first: I love Propagandhi. I think they're a great band.This album, though, is a rather generic early effort. They barely knew how to play their instruments then, and it shows. I challenge listeners to try to tell apart some of the songs on this album from NOFX (the band that got them signed). John Samson's vocal tracks are weakened by his decidedly un-punk voice; he fits in much better with The Weakerthans. The cover of Cheap Trick's ""I Want You To Want Me"" earns them kudos for sincerity, which is a Propagandhi hallmark: they don't beat around the bush.The political content is sometimes vague but always provocative. They seem to get down to specific issues much more on their later two albums.Overall, I have to say, unless you're a diehard punk or activist music fan, this probably isn't what you're looking for."
1,Tune Tools Doesn't Work,"I have tried using two of these stupid softwares. The first one wouldn't register on my or my friends computer, which both have the requirements. After I exchanged it for a second one, (because you can't get a refund at a store) it kept showing a null error, so I downloaded the patch, which is supposed to help fix the problem; but the patch didn't recognize I had the software downloaded. I emailed the company's tech support and they said they are having problems with this and don't have a solution yet!! Tunes Plus works better and is cheaper. Don't go through the same headache I did!!!"
1,Did not work for Vista,Installed and ran patch via the support page and can't even get this program to open. Don't waste your money!
5,Just what I was looking for,I live out in the country at least 25 minutes away from the nearest tackle store. It's nice to be able to find just what you are looking for at a reasonable price on Amazon. If you're a bass fisherman you know just how good these baits are. No comments are as to quality are needed. A#1.
3,"Gary Yamamoto Original 4"" Senko Worms","I just received this product after several weeks of waiting. I have not yet had the opportunity to fish with them but, weather permitting, plan to get them wet this weekend. The rating I am giving is because of the extended delay in receiving them from the seller."
3,Waking up beside you.....,"I bought this album knowingly expecting something good, but didn't think I'd be getting something as enchanting as this. It's a great follow up to Whither, Blister, burn and peel, actually Darkest Days out does it. Waking up beside you is an amazing song which completes the whole album. My favorite album of Stabbing Westward."
3,Strange combinations,"The instrumentals really rock, but it doesn't seem to match the lyrics. Sappy hardly begins to describe them, and I think this guy's been dumped one too many times. It makes great noise though, and I recommend it for all those suffering erectile dysfunction."
2,i feel it slipping away...,"Five top reasons why this is their worst album by far: 1. ""When I'm dead"", 2. ""On your way down"", 3. ""You complete me"", 4. ""Desperate now"" and finally, the headless guy on the inside of the sleeve. If you do not know SW and are interested, do yourself a favor and get the MUCH BETTER albums Ungod first, then Wither Blister Burn & Peel. Darkest Days is a joke in comparison. Laughably horrible lyrics and terribly forced riffs plague this album. Instead of progressing, SW has been regressing and the -here and there- catchy electronica can't conceal it."
5,One of my all time favorite records,"Darkest Days by Stabbing Westward is one of the records I really enjoy and have since the 7th grade. Darkest Days was the record me and my buddy used to listen to when mom and dad werent with us at school on our sony walkmens (remember those days!). This record is sonically and lyrically great. This album is very depressing and dark to say the least. It is one of the darkest albums I have ever heard or own. However, this is SW at their pinnacle. It gets no better than this. I have many copies of this record and still buy more of them when I loan someone a copy or give one away. Rest assured, this is one album I always have a copy of. One of my all time favorite records!"
5,Darkest Days - Dark,When this CD hits... It hits hard. I was very impressed with this CD. This by far is the best of the now discontinued band. I was very impressed. Too many great songs to toss this one in the bargain bin. Great sound and very dynamic audio quality.
5,STABBING WESTWARD RULES!!!,"S.W is great! I only have darkest days but it alone is one of my best c.d's Best songs are ""darkest days"" ""how can i hold on"" ""you complete me"" ""save your self"" ""sometimes it hurts"" and ""hauting me"" if you like stabbing westward e-mail me at micahthecrow@juno.com BYE!!!!"
5,"ITS DIFFERENT, BUT IT'S STILL COOL","If you believe in the end of the world, or are really depressed, this is for you. If you're not, it's still worth a look."
5,excellent,this is one of the best albums of ALL TIME by ANY artist. its one of those rare albums where nearly all of the tracks are AWESOME SONGS.get this. it is definitely Stabbing Westward's best album by far.some of the best tracks: oh wait. all of them? except maybe 10-12 which are quieter and slower. and the first title track is kinda meh but its more just filler than anything else.GO!
5,I Loved track #9!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,When I heard the song SAVE YOURSELF. I really liked it. I also heard lots of great things about this album and how it was SW greatist record. I enjoyed every song on the album. The song I liked the most was track #9 SOMETIMES IT HURT. Its very emotional and at the same time it has a industrial flow to it. Track 9 is the one song I never get tired of listing to. Also if you enjoyed this album I would also recommend UNGOD which is their first album.
2,These guys need a hug,"On their first album they were pretty pissed off. By the time the second album came along they were still pissed off but were a little sad too. On this one they're just depressed. The music they play is good, they have an edge, but I think they need to get a new lead singer/songwriter. Looking over the lyric sheet it appears he's written the same song over and over again for three albums. Sure I like a little angst ridden NINesque rock just like anybody else, but in the future I think I'll go directly to the source (the Fragile is incredible)."
4,What a follow-up!!,"Considering the power of the music, the straight forward (if not unimaginative) writing style, and the true grit of Christopher Hall's voice, this album completely rocks! Several tracks on this CD are radio worthy, and not even the best ones have been released. Listen to How Can I Hold On and Waking Up Beside You and be amazed at the true emotion Hall brings out in them."
5,intense yet mellow....some of thier best work yet,"these guys are one of my favorite bands...thier music is so easy to relate to and say ""yeah..that's happened to me"" it kinda tells you that you'r not alone"
3,Should've kept the other guitar player.,"A step down from the last album...even the first one too! The production isn't too fantastic but is a dramatic improvement to the first. ""Waking Up Beside You"" is definitely the emphisis track here...other than that,it's really not too special."
5,This is the absolute best album EVER.....,"Plain and simple, if NiN and Godhead appeal to you, then you MUST get this CD. Not only have most of my preppy friends with their rap and pop music shunned me for listening to it, but the lyrics and amazing guitar work never cease to make me want to leap into a mosh pit head first! There isn't a single thing I was disappointed about with this album, and I'm very hard to please. Usually there's one or two good songs on a CD, and that's it. But this CD was CHOCK FULL of them! ""Torn Apart"" is my favorite, and I've seen it used in various 3rd party music videos (such as Japanese anime videos put to music) and such things, and I've found it a great song to play on some loudspeakers while outside playing a game of football or something. It really gets your heart racing and makes you want to run around and go insane!"
2,Be careful!,"Great music style, one of the few NIN kind of bands that actually match up with NIN ( industrial metal, that's what they call it ).If you're a new skool goth, buy it, you'll love this thing so much that you'll kill yourself because of it. If you dislike goth stuff, then don't buy this album for the lyrics, it's hearing a person whine and brag about their self esteem problems and the such, but the music is still heavy and pretty hearable.The bad of the band itself is the fact that they only talk about their own self loathing and self esteem problems, they don't seem to open the subject more than it. Unless you identify with the band's whinnings then you won't like it. And that takes 3 stars outta the album... it's deep, but deep within a teardrop in the middle of a tropical forest and nothing more than that.But even so, don't mind my opinion, if you like fast industrial metal with lots of moanings, buy this thing, you'll probably like it."
4,One hell of a roller coaster ride,"At first listen to this CD, you are taken by the variety of sounds the album contains. Some are dark and heavy, some are soft and personal. But when you put the pieces together you get one hell of an album. Though it isnt a concept album, Darkest Days seems to start out with depressing songs and then moves onto more inspirational songs about our will to survive the trials and tribulations of life. The songs all seem to blend perfectly together, making listening to the whole CD straight through enjoyable. This is a very impressive CD and I wouldnt even consider myself a fan of the industrial-metal scene."
4,Great Music,"I thought the music is really cool, though the lyrics are somewhat repetetive. Overall the Cd is very good and would be great for prople who like the Hunger."
4,Creepy Techno,"Stabbing Westward is one helluva sleeper-hit band. Creepy, haunting, and so Depeche-Mode. Stabbing Westward will not let you down. This CD has something for everyone's dark and lonely side."
4,Brooding at its Best!,"A wonderful album that shows the pain of breaking up. Few songs can compare with ""haunting me"" for pure mental angst. Well written dark songs. Every single song is about Bad relationships or relationships ending so if that isn't your stuff stay away. Brooding at its Best!"
5,Perfect!,"This CD is unbelievable. These guys get better with every album. I cant wait for their next album. ""Save Yourself"" is the best song ever written in history. Its to bad you cant listen to it as a sampler . . . . o'well. BUY THIS CD NOW!(thats if there are any left, it took me forever to find a store where it didnt sold out)"
5,Drawing Light from Darkness,Stabbing Westward dives into the depths of dispair and anguish to show us the result of Darkest Days. This music is a harrowing experience to listen to with heart-pounding lyrics and bleeding lyrics. A must have for those who seek emotional ballads.
2,I feel it slipping away...,"Five top reasons why this is their worst album by far: 1. ""When I'm dead"", 2. ""On your way down"", 3. ""You complete me"", 4. ""Desperate now"" and finally, the headless guy on the inside of the sleeve. If you do not know SW and are interested, do yourself a favor and get the MUCH BETTER albums Ungod first, then Wither Blister Burn & Peel. Darkest Days is a joke in comparison. Laughably horrible lyrics and terribly forced riffs plague this album. Instead of progressing, SW has been regressing."
5,This CD is incredible!!!,"This is undoubtedly one of the best CDs I've ever heard. All the songs are fantastic, especially ""Sometimes It Hurts"", ""Save Yourself"", and ""Haunting Me"". All the songs blend in to each other, creating a very smooth feel throughout the entire CD. I also got the Faculty CD, which I highly recommend if you like Darkest Days.If you haven't gotten this baby, get it NOW!!! And then get Hellbilly Deluxe by Rob Zombie."
5,STABBING WESTWARD RULES,THE BEST CD IV'E HEARD IN A LONG TIME FROM THE DARK SCARY SOUNDS OF HAUNTING ME TO SOMETIMES IT HURTS THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CDS OUT THERE
4,"Darkest Days, whilst not Dark, is a pretty good listen.","Darkest Days is pretty good. There are a couple of annoying songs in the middle-end where it's super mellow and, quite frankly, pretty boring. (Drowning)But it's still a pretty good album. Save yourself, you complete me, tracks one and two are really good."
5,Depressingly good,"Didn't these guys ever hear of ""positive mental attitude""?Easily one of the least cheerful bunch of rockers in the world, Stabbing Westward again prove that they know how to write great riffs, haunting melodies and chilling lyrics.""Darkest days"" features some extremely rich and varied tracks like ""The thing I hate"" & ""Waking up beside you"", chock-full of angst. Great stuff."
5,A must-have!,"This CD turned me on to industrial (coupled with NIN, of course) and if you're looking to test the waters of this style of music, I highly recommend Stabbing Westward. This CD delivers sixteen solid tracks that convey incredible amounts of emotion... you almost feel like its your heart bleeding, not Hall's. This is definitely one of my favorite CDs and deserves six stars, not five. Also, if you're interested in a much darker sound from Stabbing Westward, check out their other CD's."
4,"Dark, but listenable release","From tracks 1 to 16 you are completely enveloped in dark and raw emotion. The opening track reminds me of Black Celebration by Depeche Mode, in just the music and how it sounds, but not the lyrics at all. The lyrics are very dark and sad and the music is just as dark. A lot of layered sounds and sound effects make this a very good industrial-esque hard rock album. The strongest (and saddest) tracks on here are Sometimes It Hurts, Desperate Now, and Waking Up Beside You. A very good soundtrack for the hopeless."
1,Decent phone not as heavy duty as the original,"I got it at my local Target for roughly half of some of the prices on here.***Update...stopped working, more Chinese made junk!"
1,Pretty NOT Practical,"I purchased this phone & it does look adorable, however it does not work. After reading several reviews on this phone I found it is an on-going problem. If you're looking for fashionable, this is a fabulous phone. However, if you're looking for function, keep looking. **LUCKILY, I purchased this item straight from Amazon. Their easy return process was wonderful and took the headache out of this problem.**"
5,"pretty, stylish and well functioning. Just like the ""classic"" version","Very pleased with this phone. It's a great shade of pink, and has the vintage styling and old fashioned ring. Substantial and dependable. Looks great and works great."
3,Princess Phone - Pink,"Cute, reminiscent of original princess phone. ""Its little, it's lovely"", but IT DOES NOT LIGHT!!! Disappointing!!"
5,Cool,I am so happy with this phone. It has a great retro look and it is heavy like phones used to be. It is adorable and looks authentic.
2,Delivered in original box,"I was dissappointed when this phone was delivered. It was not packed in any protective box, just shipped in the original box. I bought this item as a gift and it is virtually unwrappable. I have no idea if the phone works or not, but don't be suprised if you order this phone that it may be damaged."
1,broke too soon,Love the look and feel and even high-pitched ring but it stopped working within 2 months...now a cute paper weight.
4,Excellent Phone!,"I purchased this for my 92 year old mother, she loves it and she can work with it because it is so simple. Loves the look and color. Made very very very well"
2,Breaks easily,"Sadly, the piece inside the handset that allows you to hear the caller broke off, still inside the handset. You could rattle the handset around and hear it bonking from side to side. I could hardly hear anyone after that, and I hadn't owned the phone for more than 2 months when this happened. Pain in the neck. So we gave the phone to the thrift store, just in case someone who was handy enough to fix such a think might find it. Because of this cheap construction, I won't be buying any phones from this company anymore, even if it costs me extra money."
3,Princess Phone,"Looks beautiful, but it is unbalanced - not at all like the original. The receiver doesn't fit the ""cradle"" properly and the receiver often falls off the phone- the original never did that. The feet of the phone scratched my furniture. The phone has the old Princess look, but doesn't quite have its body engineering. The sound reception and clarity are perfect - better than today's cordless electronic phones. However, I'd buy this Crosley 1950's phone again, despite what I consider as minor flaws."
4,A Great Set of Episodes!!!,This DVD has great cover art and has a great collection of episodes. It doesn't have great special features but it is still a good thing to have if you are into Futurama. Overall I give this DVD 4 stars because of it's great episode collection and cover art.
5,One of the best animated comedy ever!,"Futurama is easily one of the best animated programs ever! Ive seen every episode at least 3 times, and I still laugh. The grunka lunkas get me every time. There isnt a bad episode in the whole first season.Some people say that futurama was just trying to be the simpsons, but that is so far from the truth. I personally think this show was better than the simpsons, and i do love the simpsons. Futurama almost seems to have a smarter style of comedy to it, and there are so many great spoofs in this series. Bottom line, if you like comedy, sci-fi, or if you hate sci-fi, this is for you. And dont get me started on how mad i am with fox for canceling this show.P.S. If you like Futurama, you should also check out Family Guy, another great show that fox canceled."
4,I tried to watch the DVD - but Fox pre-empted it,"Just kidding! However watching these shows on DVD really makes you appreciate how much Groening and his people put in the background. The commnetaries are OK, but sometimes they drag and are just the people watching the show. Also, Billy West (Fry, Professor, others)while talented doesn't add very much. But the commentaries with John Di Maggio (Bender, and others) really are pretty funny, give you some good background.If you are a Simpsons fan or a Futurama Fan, you will like these."
5,The TRUE picture of the future...,"Fry is accidental cryagenic frozen and ends up in the year 3000. After that just toss the logic out the window. A one-eyed alien, a hard-drinking robot, a great-great-great-forever nephew and a brave new world to explore! The first 13 episodes, each with full-length audio commentary which is as funny as the episodes themselves. PLUS delected scenes, a behind-the-scenes featurette and lots of other extras. While the series is making fun of sci-fi, it is also sometimes very serious, dealing with issues of romance, sin and racism against robots. OK, OK, the series doesn't take much of anything seriously. There are suicide booths, Robot Washes, anchovies, a Robot Hell, New New York City, living heads, liquid aliens, addictive soft drinks and invasions of Earth."
5,Had to come back for the Crushinator...didn't you?,Nothing to say other than: The BEST SHOW EVER!Eat me: The Simpsons
3,Good fun. Better than the Simpsons? No way!,"Although Futurama didn't last that long on the Fox network, it was still a nicely animated and funny show. But the reason why it didn't last very long is because it didn't have that special touch that the Simpsons had. Sure, Bender is cool and one of my favorite characters but the other characters you can't help but hate sometimes. (Fry's uncle is an old fart) It was also nice of them to mix computer graphics in with the animation because it blended nicely though! Futurama is a decent comedy, but I prefer The Simpsons over it, which is so much better! If you do not agree, you must be on something."
5,whyyyyyyyyyyyyy! why did fox get rid of futurama,i started watching this show because i (emarissingly) can't veiw the simpsons. you know settle for the next best thing. but judging by the few simpsons episodes i've seen the comedy was the same but futurama was going somwhere with its plots like the future and fry and leela getting together. each charecter has his own little developing part in the season. i would give this an 100 but it only goes up to 5
5,Love This Show And The Simpsons!!!!!!!!!,I love this show and The Simpsons. I read a stupid review talking about this show is funnier than the simpsons. This show is not funnier than the simpsons because their both funny and their both created by Matt Groening. If you don`t watch the simpsons or don`t like the simpsons your just a loser. And you going to write about that we need to buy this instead of the simpsons. I`d rather buy both!!!!!!!!!!!!!. So all you people thinking that this show is funnier than the simpsons your just a loser!!!!!!!!!!!.
2,NOT Better Than The Simpsons!,"Maybe some of you on here are out of it, Futurama's best episode isn't funnier than ""The Simpsons"" worst episode. Fox cancelled this show because it had no viewers, cause it wasn't funny."
5,Kick Booty,Probally the only show in television history that got funnier as it went on. Great commentary on evey episode. MAn it's just Futurama. Either you're in or your not.
5,Bring back futurama!!!!!1,This show is one of the best shows ever created. I have owned all the dvds since they came out and watch them all the time. if you are a fan make sure to goto this site to help bring futurama back.http://www.bringbackfuturama.com/thanks
5,AWESOME FILM OR DVD TO OWN .BEST CARTOON,"FUTURAMA is the funniest show with cast members with names like Frye,Leela,Bender,The Professor,Amy,The Lobster Doctor,and others it has lots on this dvd and the 9 episodes feature laughs,a nice since of jokes,and good cartoon lines and situations.own this one now on dvd."
5,A great start to a great show.,"Every episode in this first season is classic. A pizza delivery boy is thrust a thousand years into the future by an accidental freezing. Giant garbage balls threaten the Earth. Robots consume alcohol for sustinance. Anchovies are almost priceless. A highly addictive drink called ""Slurm"" has finally taken out Coke and Pespi. And aliens walk the streets of New New York.Matt Groening has created a series that is as funny as ""The Simpsons"" much of the time, and is far better than the first season (and some others) of ""The Simpsons."" Great characters, great stories, and great animation, (with great references to sci-fi TV and movies) make this a great show."
5,"Grab some chips, sit back, and enjoy the show","Man it's sad that I watched this for the first time on adult swim. I got this just 2 days ago, and I didn't see every single episode, but this show is, right alongside family guy, is the funnest series created.This had a lot of comedy genius, and right when I saw it for the first time(where Bender has a religion). I just had to buy the whole series.My friends and family love this as much as family guy, and so do I, if you love conedy, don't hesitate to pick this up, since the priece is a (Lemme go Godfather style) an offer you can't refuse. I dunno why fox cancelled this, and Family guy, but they were both top-caliber comedy.Peace"
5,Great Show But Not Worth The $$,"I absolutely love this show, but you can simply pay 8 bucks a month to wtach every volume and more on Netflix. I bought this before Netflix even had it, so consider yourself lucky."
2,Performance - Marginal,Though I have installed this close to the kitchen (cooking area) it isn't effective in removing odor.
3,Interesting to a point,"""Who's Looking Out For You"" is basically Bill O'Reilly's opinion on society today. The facts are presented from Bill's point of view, which makes the book relatively fun to read due to O'Reilly's blunt, in your face presentation of his ideas and what he thinks the problem with society is. However, Bill tries to give the reader advice throughout the novel, and no matter what he's complaining about, the message is always the same: Don't trust people in power. The fact that this message is being constantly thrust in your face makes parts of the book somewhat irritating. Another problem is that Bill is whining about something throughout most of the book. Due to this, the book could be viewed as a 100+ page complaint. However, the book is interesting and therefore worth the read in my opinion."
3,Who's Looking Out for You?,"Wouldn't know, because I got all 4 of the same books, not this one. I had to return 3 out of 4 books ... not sure if I ever received the refund for those 3 books."
3,Wisdom with a grain of salt,"I never really listened to Bill O'Reilly's radio or TV show so I didn't really know much about his persona. I mainly got to know a little bit about his personality in book form, and I felt it to be refreshing.In his first chapter he talked about how if you don't have anybody to look out for you, then hire a good lawyer to be your only friend because you are probably going to need one.""Generous people will not associate with selfish jerks""O'Reilly spends a lot of time in the book defending himself on issues, which can be really one-sided.For the most part he gives great advice and wisdom that can be helpful and inspiring to anyone."
2,Years from now...,"...because it is, after all, a living language, the name ""O'Reilly"" will become interchangeable with the words, ""schmuck"", ""buffoon"" and ""horse's rear end""...be sure to wear a clothespin on your nose if you find yourself in desperate enough straits to actually read this...granted an extra, sympathy star, because Letterman publicly eviscerated him the other night...attaboy, Dave!"
2,Constantly trying to prove something.,"Bill does a good job here explaining the problems with the current morality of American's but other then that,he sounds as if he is constantly trying to uphold his beliefs on us, continually bitching about people who do not choose to appear on the the o-reilly-factor, and downing everyone who has a bad word to say about him..he claims he is not conservative, yet this book shows his support for almost every republican in power.. (who in there right MIND can say that george bush genuinely cares for our country?!) and defines himself to be 'with the working-class..'POSER!"
4,Don't let the messenger distract you from the message!,"Okay, say what you will about Bill O'Reilly, he certainly won't be at my funeral, but the message of this book is very insightful. Keep politics in perspective and this book is valuable for the overall message it carries, like the title says, it is really an analysis of your life. Are the important people in your life taking you into consideration?Review every book you read- authors deserve your opinions, not just elitist critics."
3,EDIT: Missing acoustic intro to American Woman!,"2006 The Best of the Guess Who [EXTRA TRACKS] This version is missing the acoustic intro to American Woman! If you're like me that will really bother you every time the track starts. Better to get the older best of the guess who, I didn't find the extra tracks on this all that essential enough to edit a classic song."
3,Canadian Hit Machine,"Sure it's good, but is it necessary? The Guess Who were a great singles band at the turn of the `70s, when FM album rock stations were taking over from AM Top 40 outlets. Led by the distinctive voice of Burton Cummings, the band had a six-year string of catchy tunes that were an essential part of the era's soundtrack. Here, the group's Best of album from 1971 gets the Legacy treatment, with three extra tracks. But the 1999 disc, Greatest Hits, still trumps it because it has post-'71 material like ""Star Bay"" and ""Clap for the Wolfman"" and the long version of ""American Woman."" (There's also a two-disc Anthology.) What the record company should do is add ""Bus Rider,"" ""Do You Miss Me Darlin"" and ""Broken"" from this collection to the Greatest Hits confab, and release a definitive 21-track single CD that really could be called ""Best"" or ""Greatest.""Originally published in Port Folio Weekly, 1/24/06Copyright 2006 Port Folio Weekly. Used by permission."
5,THIS IS THE ONE TO GET,"Ignore the myriad choices of ""best of"" and ""essential"" and enjoy vocal gymnast Burton Cummins at his best. The only ""hit"" missing is ""6 A.M. Or Nearer"" which you can live without."
5,Still one of the best,"I am considerably young for this kind of music, but when I turned 15 I bought a 72 mustang that had an 8-track player and the only 8-track I had came with the car and was the Guess Who. Unfortunately, I no longer have the 8-track or a way to play it, but this CD takes me back to when life was easy. Great sound quality (better than an 8-track), and all of there greatest songs. This CD couldn't be better"
5,Superb Compilation,This compilation is one of the best I've heard. The Guess Who were actually a break from the British Invasion for me. I loved them from the time I first heard American Woman. This compilation is a must have for any Guess Who fan.
3,timely fasion,"it came fast and in good shape but it did not fit. i have returned it for a full refund, as of now i have not heard from anyone 2/10/11"
2,yet another sterotypical movie about pretty girls,"the formula is so stale...Uma Thurman plays the beautiful, but dumb blonde, Jeanne the smart but average looking women, and Ben the smart and beautiful guy....of couse, jeanne is so great and smart but just lacks looks, while Uma is just looks, and the main man is both...whatever...as if the world isn't full of beautiful smart girls or dumb average looking girls...this is so ... the revenge against the beautiful types..moreover, this movie tries to go against a age old, time old fact about love relationships..that looks matter a lot...that's just ...i mean you have to actually want to be with the person..not just a friendship..oh well...this movie is so divorced from the real world...i mean you don't see tom cruise dating rosie o' donnell (who is funny and smart)..instead he dated penelope cruz (who is also smart, beautiful and talented)...."
3,"Fun, light romantic comedy","This is an enjoyable female version of Ceranco de Bergerac tale. I think a common misperception of this film is that Janeane Garofalo's character, Abby, is supposed to be an unattractive woman who can't get a man because of her dowdy looks. In fact, Abby is actually someone who has many attractive attributes--she's a smart, funny, pretty professional woman who can get a man but is held back by her insecurities and very low self-esteem. That is why Abby decides to use Uma Thurman's Noelle, who is tall, thin, and blonde--her complete opposite--as her body double. I don't normally like romantic comedies, but this film is sweet and has a nice message--just be yourself and don't pretend to be something you're not to make other people happy. This is one of Janeane's few leading roles. I wish she could get the lead in more movies, but because she looks more like a regular woman and not like a runway model, she gets stuck in supporting parts. It's a shame."
4,Wonderful!,"It's a 'chick flick' guys, but a wonderful one. If you're looking to warm someone up on a romantic evening, this is the movie to bring home. As an animal lover, I love the way an adorable dog quietly leads two people together. A love story with humor...Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
2,"Not A Review Of The Movie, But The Blu-Ray As A Whole","First of all, the reason I ordered this movie on Blu-Ray was a reason just about everybody does so, because I really liked the movie, and this is still the case. Now, I was excited to see this released on Blu-Ray, but after throwing it in for the first time, I was extremely disappointed in the video quality. To be honest, it really looked no better than the DVD I have. It's quite grainy, and dark in some spots. Add to that, when the disc is thrown in, the movie starts right up, which I thought was strange. Then I realized that is because there is no menu for the movie at all. Are you serious? Unless I'm missing something, or got a different copy than everyone else. So, the blu-ray version of this movie is really no big catch. If you've got the DVD, that should more than suffice."
2,blu ray review only,"Since there is only one comment on the blu-ray, thought I'd do a quick review on that. I'm a fan of this movie and preordered an upgrade to the blu ray without a second thought. Boy, was I disappointed! I'm a videophile, and not into the technical aspects, but this barely looked like a blu-ray to me. See bluray.com for comparable review, too late for me but not for you if you have the dvd and are still considering an upgrade. (I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 only because I couldn't quite do a ""hate it"" and bring the overall review score down too much.)"
5,Of mice & men,I liked the synergy between the characters and the way the movie addresses the underlying theme in a lighthearted way.
5,Gender Reversal,"For those classical-minded among you the plot of this movie is taken directly from Cyrano de Bergerac, with the gender roles reversed.Janeane Garofalo is Cyrano, and instead of an enormous nose she's just short and a little plump. When placed beside six foot tall blond haired Uma Thurman, she's rather overshadowed.But like Cyrano she's the smart, funny spirit that Roxanne - I mean Ben - falls in love with, not knowing the voice he hears isn't the face he meets.Absolutely great movie and Janeane gets the final punchline:""I don't know - I made a lot of calls that night...""The straight line that feeds it you must see for yourself."
4,Janeane Garofalo is a woman to die for...,"This movie is great. The movie portrays the insecurities of a person who does not think he or she is phsically attractive rather accurately. I'm really glad the guy ended up with the smart girl. The only problem with the movie is the ""idea"" that Janeane Garofalo isn't pretty... SHE IS, DAMN IT!!!! However, she was the perfect embodiment of a really insecure person.... Loved the dog too.... A great date movie..."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this video as a movie my elderly mother would probably enjoy. She needs to have close-captioning available to truly enjoy the movie. On this product, that option was not available. The notation said to access the subtitles via the television or dvd player being used. But those options were in use and still there were no subtitles, so the whole purchase was a wasted effort."
2,a little disappointed,I was a little disappointed with my purchase. I do NOT like bootleg movies and once I played the DVD it was obvious that it had been copied from a legal DVD copy. The sound quality wasn't horrible but throughout the entire movie the sound is kinda static and shaky. I'm pretty sure I'm just spend more money and go buy it from the store. I did receive the movie in a very good time frame though and it was neatly packaged.
4,Good Title,"This film has one fundamental flaw of logic: What on Earth is supposed to be wrong with the way Janeane Garofolo looks?!! Her acting chops are certainly not lacking either. She is as good an actor as she is beautiful. But don't get me wrong, I'll never be blind to Uma Thurman's charms! This is a very good, though slightly formulaic comedy that still manages to get in a few barbs about our appearance-obsessed society and about how we can all sometimes be stung by a momentary lapse of self-esteem. Janeane, you're a great talent and I wish you very well."
5,The Truth is: Be Yourself!!!!,"A chick flick with a sensitive wise message... be the real you from the get go. No one can be you except you. Uma Thurman helps neighbor Garofolo woo a listener only to create a love triangle in the midst. Does it really have to be a choice between beauty and brains? And isn't beauty in the eye of the beholder. That said, if you feel you need to be someone you are not to win over another ... they aren't worth it 100%! Besides ... with all the breeds of cats and dogs out there ... there is an owner for every pedigree ... not all canines have to be poodles to be loved .... not all felines have to be persians either. A cool LA romantic comedy of the lengths we should never go to capture someone's heart."
2,"Movie still great, DVD quality leaves a lot to be desired","I loved this movie when it first came out, and I still love it, which is why I ordered the DVD. However, the scenes are coming off as dark (as in unlighted) and without needed contrast. There was also one point where the DVD skipped. For less than $6 the DVD was worth it, but if it had been any more I would return it."
4,"Quirky, silly yet really fun and cute ;-)","I rewatched this the other day for the first time in years and I loved it again. Sure parts are kind of quirky etc, but it's lighthearted fluff that is fun to watch. Uma Thurman is good in her role; she steals the guy from Janeane Garofalo (only to have it work out in the end which is completely unpredictable - NOT!!!). I love the apearance by Jamie Foxx. He was still cute back in those days (yes the movie is now 10 years old). It's a nice light comedy that will appeal to everyone who loves romantic movies where the girl gets the guy and a lot of hilarities in between. I like it."
4,"""YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!""","This movie purports to tell the ""truth"" about cats and dogs, but I'm pretty sure there are still some things they're not telling us. Amiable comedy earns high marks for its sly wit and adorable assortment of furry co-stars, plus Janeane Garofalo looks surprisingly hot in a thong bikini."
5,Wonderful & Insightful,What a great book. It is amazing how much correspondence reveals about people. This book was so interesting. It truly covers decades of Black artisitic history.
2,"Poorly designed, nothing fits - seems designed for smaller European rolls","The paper towel holder was much too small for the large size Bounty rolls I buy from places such as Costco. Ditto for the plastic wrap holder. Appears to have been designed with much smaller European-sized products in mind.Also the item is not easily drilled into the wall as the screw holes are stupidly placed in one of the smaller roll holders, making it impossible to fit a drill into that space and very difficult to fit even a screwdriver without cutting your hand along the metal teeth. A shockingly expensive disappointment."
2,Great looks but functions poorly,"At first I was pleased. The stainless steel appears to be of high quality and it looks great mounted in my kitchen, which has stainless steel appliances. However, it is almost impossible to cut the plastic wrap using the holder and the paper towel dispenser holds only the small or regular rolls, rather than the jumbo ones I normally buy. I would give it 1 star on functionality but am giving it two stars because it looks great."
3,It Looks cool........but,"We live in a very compact house. This looked cool and sleek, compact and functional. It is the first three things but not functional. Paper towel rolls are too big to fit. Once you get them sized down a bit they fit but it doesn't keep edge of paper towel where it is easily reachable without touching another, in the case of messy hands. It hold the aluminum foil and plastic wrap but doesn't tear them very straight. I have it, I'll use it but it was way less helpful then I expected and wanted."
3,Not a must have,"This toy spent more time at the bottom of the toy box then anywhere else. I hated that my daughter would shove the mallet in her mouth (babies chew on everything) I was spending more time worrying about her gagging herself with it then I was with if she would have fun playing it. She never really cared to bang on it. she just wanted to chew on it. Now my 4 year old liked to ""play"" it right.. but it didnt really make that loud of sound and she had to wack it pretty good."
5,great toy!,"I thought this was the perfect gift for my 1yr old. She loves to make music and often my 2yr old will join. I didn't hear any ""out-of-pitch"" keys. They sounded fine to me! Great toy for musical development!"
2,Bad Bad Bad,"Ordered this for my one year old. I play all instruments by ear. I am highly sentitive to the sounds that even toy instruments produce, and this one does not even come close. I have seen and own toy xylaphones that sound WAY better than this one. Not one single bell is in tune, and if I try to play a song on it, it does not even sound like the song I am trying to play. If you want your child to actually play music instead of making noise, do not order this!!!! Gave it to the Goodwill."
3,One minor tweak,This is a pretty decent toy. One minor tweak is that I had to cut the string holding the stick immediately because it's too hard to play with such a short string. But now she enjoys banging away at it with whatever she can get her hands on at the time.
2,Off Key,"This xylophone would be great, except one of the keys is out of tune. It's so annoying, you can't play any basic song, nothing sounds right all because of one little off note. Otherwise I would really like this toy."
2,Just has a cheap feel,Product seemed cheaper then you would hope. If you get it on a good sale I guess you get what you pay for.
2,Out of tune,"Sadly, a couple of the notes on the xylophone we received was out of tune. I contacted Little Tykes' customer support, and was told that it wasn't supposed to be a usable instrument, just a toy. Er... My toddler has plenty of toys, but I wanted her to learn music, hence the xylophone.After I pressed them on their purported high standards, CS relented and offered to replace it, but the only option was to destroy the toy and send them proof, after which they'd send me another--with no guarantee that the next one would be in tune. I'd rather cut my losses and give this one to Goodwill than deal with the hassle.Lesson Learned: I won't ever buy an instrument online again."
2,Horribly out of tune,"This thing would be a fine toy except the pitch is so off, the songs are barely recognizable. The toy is little more than a fun noisemaker... but don't expect any musical ability to be nurtured by this thing."
4,toy info,"I buy one of these for each of my children's families. They are a great gift because even though they make sound, it is not obnoxious or too loud. Children love them."
2,Out of tune!,This xylophone is completely out of tune. The smallest bar actually has a lower pitch than the one next to it. I was disappointed that Little Tikes would make a musical instrument and not even take the time to make it in tune. I am sure kids will have fun hitting the bars but to me it isn't worth it.
3,just ok - music not as described,it's ok for the price. the sound is not great but i like that the handle is attached. the biggest disappointment is that the box says the music is color coded. it is not! it is simply a black and white photocopy of the music card. i will have to redo it myself.
2,Good for noise making but not for music,"My son received this for Christmas. Unlike other child xylophones we've used, this one is completely out of tune.We tried playing 'twinkle twinkle little star' and 'Mary had a little lamb' on it but it's not possible with the bizarre notes assigned to the keys.It appears they had a manufacturing problem or quality control issue and sent them out anyway.This xylophone might pass as a toy but don't get it if you want to teach your child music."
2,Not worth it,"We had this toy and returned it in 24 hours. I wanted a xylophone for my daughter who asked for one at age 2. This was a poor example of a xylophone. There are 2 keys that are the same length and therefore play the same note. The string for the mallet is so short you can hardly enjoy hitting the keys. It's durable and colorful, but that's not enough for parents to endure the shrill noise that comes from playing it. Little Tikes needs to go back to the drawing board on this one."
3,Great for older toddlers,"I bought this toy for my daughter's first birthday, which it turns out was a little early for her to use it -- she couldn't figure out how to use the stick to hit the keys and just ended up banging on it with her hand. She's 18 months now and just getting the hang of it, so if you have a little one you may want to wait a while!"
2,Out of tune,"Really wish I had seen these reviews on the terrible sound quality (both tone and pitch) of this xylophone. The top four notes are horrendously out of tune. A friend in the neighborhood has the same model and they have the same complaint. If you intend to foster musicality in your toddler, definitely look elsewhere."
1,Trouble With It,The thing is NOT in tune - not a big deal to a child but annoying to be around at times. Yup.
3,A bit lame,"I liked it at first but, it doesn't sound very clear and the little keys get loose and then sound awful. For a baby, toddler toy I would go with a baby piano or drum this is a bit hard for them to understand and when they do they get bored with it very quick."
3,There are better xylopones,"Our daughter has three xylophones (don't asky why) and this one has the poorest sound quality of the three (granted one is a nice wooden xylophone). The sound is very tingy and the notes do not sustain very long after impact. The hammer is very light and bends easily.If you want a cheap xylophone for your child, I would recommend the ""2-in-1 Crocodile Keys Musical Instrument"" by Fisher Price. We have one of these and our daughter loves it."
4,nice toy for a small child,This is a nice size product for a small child. I bought it for my 18 month old and she really likes it. It is smaller than the other brands but it has more notes than most. The hammer to strike the notes is attached so you dont have to look for it. and it has a handle so it can be carried from room to room which is what my daught does all the time I think itis a good buy
3,Hideously out of tune!,"My husband and I bought this for our 8 month old who enjoys banging on things to further introduce her to music. She has mostly enjoyed banging on the keys with other objects but does use the striker some as well. We were very upset when we played our first notes on it as it is painfully out of tune. Fine for banging, but buy another brand if you care about music!"
3,Xylophone,"I think every kid goes through a phase where they want to hit things and make noise. This is the perfect toy. What's better is that the ""bat"" you tap with is attached and nearly impossible to remove so there's no hunting down a drum stick when it's time to make some music.. errrr.... baby noise! :)"
1,Scale not correct,"I purchased this for my grandchild and ended up returning it. Yes, it is durable. Yes, it is colorful. But, no, it does not play the notes correctly. The scale is out of tune. It plays high notes ""lower"" than the low notes. If you want your child to play songs or to hear the actual scale, this is not the toy to buy. For not much additional cost I purchased a xylophone listed under Musical Instruments."
1,Notes are wrong,It only takes a few seconds to notice that this xylophone has two keys that play the same note. This makes it impossible to play any of the songs. Absurd.
2,Poor sound quality,"2 out of 8 keys are very flat, so none of the songs that we tried sound good on it. I'm very disappointed and will be looking into returning it."
2,Atonal xlyophone with too-short string,"I normally love Little Tikes but this xylophone was a disappointment. First of all, only 5 of the keys were in tune. One was so badly out of tune that even my 5 year old could tell the difference. If you can't actually play a simple tune or a scale on it, what's the point? I might as well give my kids pots and a wooden spoon and save my money. Also, you'd need to actually cut the cord to use the little hammer. My 2 year old was immediately frustrated by not being able to reach the last key easily. I sent it back."
4,pretty good toy,"My toddler enjoys it but the stick is on a pretty short string hard for her to maneuver, but I do prefer it be attached than not"
3,Okay,Bought this as a gift for my granddaughter. I thought is would have a better sound and I think the string could be a little longer to actually reach all the keys easier.For the money I would not recommend this one.
1,THE HECK IS THIS?!,"This is a tad out of place. It's not Dio (i.e. Ronnie James). Perhaps it belongs under Pino, or whatever."
2,fast delivery,"The dvd was received fast, though the last half was unplayable even after cleaning. It could not be blamed on the seller as it took several weeks before we were able to watch the dvd. However, delivery was fast."
4,Flying By,I really like Billy Ray Cyrus - so when I saw this DVD on Amazon - I decided to get it. It is a very good family movie and that is what I like best about Billy Ray. He is a very decent man and doesn't get involved in trashy movies.
5,WONDERFUL**A FIVE STAR +++++++++++,"THIS IS A MUST SEE, MUST HAVE. A MOVIE FOR ALL AGES, FRIENDS AND FAMILY. A FIVE STAR PLUS RATING."
1,really just a poncho,"I completed the order on Monday and received it Wednesday with standard shipping. I would recommend buying from the vendor.With that being said, this item is basically a poncho. It feels like a heavy trash bag, i'm concerned it's going to rip very quickly. The logo looks like a decal that will peel soon. I wouldnt have bought this if I saw it in a store. I'd send it back but I've already paid the $8 to ship it here, plus it would be another few bucks to send it back and $5 for a restocking fee. So my choice becomes $16 for nothing or the $36 ive paid with shipping. My recommendation is just buy a poncho."
5,Great toy,"This toy is geat alternative for Lego. My child plays Lego all the time. This is a good toy to let kids learn other construction method. It's very durable and easy to find. This toy is more suitable for the 8+ years old kids. For the younger kids, they might loose interest quickly because the pieces are harder to connect together compare with Lego."
5,Great basic gig book,"This collection of 65 pieces, has good choices of songs for the different categories of music that someone playing piano gigs will need to know. These include showtunes, jazz tunes, classical, Latin, pop-rock, love songs, standards, and even miscellaneous songs such as Hava Nagila, and the Star Spangled Banner. The basic piano arrangements are good, but not too complicated. A good pianist can use these basic arrangements and go on and improvise two or three more choruses. But for the non-improvising pianist, the arrangements will sound good. Even for the improvising pianist, these written arrangements give a good idea of how the song should probably feel. That's why they are better than simply using a lead sheet or fake book. And, for the non-performing pianist, they are just plain fun to play. You will find many of your favorite songs in this book."
4,Angel: The Complete Second Season,"I recommend this DVD to anyone who has seen the first season of Angel, or anyone who just likes Angel, Buffy, and/or supernatural shows. The quality of the DVD is okay, but occasionally the discs arrive with scratches on them, so watch out. Also, the DVD sets are packaged in the smallest boxes, so the DVD cases are sometimes mashed at the corners. Other than that, this is a great buy for any Sci Fi fans. Just be sure to purchase it when it's on sale! ($34.99 from $44.99)"
1,Angel - Season Two (Slim Set),"The problem with this DVD is that it does not play in NZ so it is useless, can I send it back?"
1,Not a good buy,"Let me caveat this by saying that I am a huge BtVS fan, and bought Angel Seasons 1 and 2 just because I was captivated by the Buffyverse. While Angel Season 1 was okay, in my opinion, Angel Season 2 was overly PC and was almost painful to sit through. I was disappointed with this DVD set, do not plan to purchase future Angel DVDs, and even ended up giving away Season 2 because I never want to watch it again. I guess it is rare to find a spinoff series that even comes close to the magic of the original. If you're looking for another good TV series, I'd recommend Smallville or any Buffy Season that you haven't already seen."
5,Pleased as punch!,"I bought this item as a birthday gift for my sister. She hasn't watched all the episodes yet so I can't comment on the quality of all the DVDs, but I can say the ones she's seen so far are in the condition they were described (Like New). Communication between the seller and me was great, and the item arrived faster than I had anticipated. All in all, I'm very pleased with the transaction."
5,Excellent,NO more words than excellentMy favourite serieThe thrill the fighting the action the villians EVERYTHING is espectacurarly excellent
4,Fan of the show,"I really like this show when it first started out. The first few seasons were really good, but then it started to go downhill so bad that I stopped watching."
2,"I really wanted to like this, but . . .","I was trying to find something on the level of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but this is not it. Only James Marster's performances made some of the episodes enjoyable."
4,Angel Comes Into its Own,"Season two was really the season Angel came into its own as a series separate from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. What really made season two great, at least for the first half of the season, was Julie Benz's tragically wonderful performance as Angel's sire, Darla. Not only did the character grow and become more than just a vampire killer, we got to learn more of the background behind hers and Angel's tempestuous relationship; including how Darla was sired by The Master. This was also a really great season for the supporting players, Cordelia and Wesley most of all. An of course we can't forget Andy Hallett's tour de force performance as the Host, Lorne. As the season progressed we got to know more about him, about what he can do, and where he came from. Not to mention the fact that he can sing! The end sets up season three, which is almost as good a season."
5,the buildup,"I love Angel so this is a bias review. For Joss Whedon fans the entire series (Angel seasons 1-5) is a must have collection. Amazon tends to put them on sale but if you can't wait order now!As for this season, as I say in the title I like to think of this season as a buildup for season 3. Still this season was the point at which Angel hit 'rock bottom', and watching him descend then ascend was absolutely painful and wonderful at the same time. And the last four episodes of this season are spectacular; the setting changes from the dark lonely streets of LA to this spectacularly bright, green, and good vs. evil dimension.I love it."
2,I guess this was an experimental year for Angel,Season two of Angel is not that great. It has one or two episodes that are really good but it is pretty cheesy on the whole. The first and third seasons were great but season two seemed like an experimental year. I don't think the writers knew where Angel was going at the time. I bought this DVD because I want to have every season of Angel on DVD. I didn't buy it because I love it and think it's a landmark season. The episodes are pretty weak and the extras are even more sad. There are a couple of extras but they are only seven or eight minutes long. You would think that Fox would have good extras to make up for the bad episodes of Angel. Season four of Buffy was not very good but it was full of extras. Why couldn't this set be full of good extras? I would just save my money for Season three if I were you and skip this volume. The writers knew where Angel was going in season three.
4,nice follow up to establish the show,"Lots of great plot twists and turns, new faces and several old ones!"
4,JOSH,"i think this is a good season especially with darla and dru coming back and going into angels history but somethings are kind of weird, personally i like buffy better but its cool 2 watch angel too becaause the storylines together and sometimes there are cross overs which are cool! i give it 4 stars"
3,"It did not fit without modification - not very precise, BAD","This came and looked great - it wasn't too hard to install EXCEPT that the holes didn't line up - when the two rear holes were lined up the tongue hole was about 1/2"" or more off to the side - So I had to buy some other hardware and some spacers and make it work - the instructions also don't warn you to cut off the bolt to make room for the exhaust to go back where it needs to go - a little annoying - would have taken only 1 hour to install - instead took about 2.25 hours. BUT IT still hit the exhaust so I had to search around for an exhaust place that would bend the exhaust some and then put a stiffer exhaust hanger so it won't move around - lots of wasted time - it works but was 5 hours of effort and an extra 20-50$ of exhaust stupidity"
1,Waste of money...,Made with cheap plastic and not very sturdy if using the elbow connections. Best case scenario is that it provides an extension for height.
1,For ELECTRIC Models only!,"This universal kit was on sale, combo special discount with my gas powered pressure washer, so I got it. BUT, the ad fails to state that it is for electric power washers only - and even then, the peices are for several different models only. - So you may only have 1 or 2 peices that would fit your washer! It's also cheaply made and packaged, w/ por instructions. Don't waste your money!"
2,Does not fit AR Blue Clean,"Good quality and price, lots of adapters but none of them fitAR North America AR383 1,900 PSI 1.5 GPM 11 Amp Electric Pressure Washer With Hose Reel. It is advertised to fit most electric power washers; so, for sure I thought it would fit mine since it's so popular. Nope. Customer service rep couldn't provide information on which specific brands this kit is supposed to fit, either. However, the manual that came with it did say something like: ""Fits most Karcher and other electric power washers."" So, you may have more luck with Karcher. I just ended up ordering a similar kit directly from AR Blue Clean website--a bit more expensive but no guesswork."
2,more nozzle options needed,While there were all sorts of variations for connecting to the hose there was only one option for the nozzle.
2,Adapters don't fit the AR112 pressure washer,I bought this accessory kit to use with my AR112 pressure washer. The kit includes 5 adapters but none of them fit the AR112. I had to return the kit to Amazon
4,missing parts,"Great price and product works well for now. However,product is missing nuts and screws for the handle bar."
4,Power washer attachments,Have not used item yet but it seems to be in very good condition and everything it was advertized to be
5,Ah...the good ol' days!,"I remember collecting this set of cards while I was a kid, but as a kid I basically destroyed them...by playing with them. I didn't start taking good care of trading cards until I started collecting sports cards. In this box, I basically got the whole set and 4/5 Holograms. Great Buy!"
3,Another good basic book on GSD,"Although this book is a little more German Shepherd specific than The German Shepherd Dog by Hegewald & Kawich, it's still rather basic dog information. It does however, go into a little more depth about training the German Shepherd which is why I kept this book"
2,Smaller than description.,"I just opened the box I received to be disappointed. This pan does not measure 9x13 inches. The sides angle out. The inside base measures 6.5""x 11"". The top measures 8""x 13"". The depth is only 2.25"". I expect the quality of the pan to be just fine, but I am going to return it because I was really expecting the dimensions to be 9""x13""."
5,Process Map Like a Pro!,"I have used this text in university and real-world business settings with great success. Unlike many other texts on the subject, this one gets to the heart of the matter, quickly and neatly. There's little theory here; this is a how-to book of first order.Galloway's approach to decision diamonds is the best I have seen. Also, her use of process checks is simple but consistent with other preventive prescriptions, such as FMEA and QFD.The last chapters are dedicated to several techniques to improve processes. They beg for a few more examples, but even with this little drawback, all of the major process engineering tools are listed.I am ordering 12 more texts for my Ops Team. We will use this text as a backbone of our continuous improvement activites over the next year."
2,Buy only if you know NOTHING about process mapping,"The author explains basics in painful detail. The example used are purposely non-business (setting the table, getting gas for your car) so as to illustrate the ""concept"" of process mapping. So, if you know absolutely nothing about process mapping, I suppose this is a good place to start. However, this is SO basic, it would also help your appreciation of this book if you were a complete dolt. If, on the other hand, you are looking for practical applications to your work processes (rather than seeting your table or getting gas for your car), you're in the wrong book! Similarly, if you'd like to get past the basics, then you have to go past this book."
3,Mapping work processes,"Unfortunately for the money I expected more. This is a paperback spiral bound book and the contents were not what I had expected. If I would have understood that the processes mapped were not the typical ""business"" processes I would not have purchased it. It is now sitting on my bookshelf and I'll be looking to sell it back."
1,"Product ""Not intended for use in the U.S.A."" and expires within 5 months","The box says ""Not intended for use in the U.S.A."" and ""Labeling may differ from that in the U.S. (FDA)""Also, the product expires in five months, which is something to keep in mind if you wanted to keep these on hand for longer than that."
2,"5 stars for the product, 2 stars for the bottle I received.","Siemans makes Multistix with about a 18 month ""use by date."" The bottle I received had only 4 month use left.It is important to follow the use by date on these because certain tests strips will fail and you will start to get false positive readings. Leucocytes and Urobilinogin will be the first to start giving a false positive. Test strips can be useful for many reasons. Make sure that you throw these out by the ""use by date,"" they are not like eggs which can be eaten weeks after the use by date. Your bottle should have 12 months of ""life"" left in it."
2,Not Bayer Brand. Got Siemens brand,"I called the company directly to get the expiration date before ordering, which was about 10 months away, which was acceptable. However, I did ask not what brand, since the description states specifically ""Multistix Bayer Urine Test Strips 10 SG, 100/box"" and the picture is of the Bayer Multistix 10-SG. I assumed it was more expensive than the other companies since it was the true Bayer product. I got the product today and it is the Siemens brand, which I could have ordered about $5-10 cheaper from other companies. The expiration date was what the person said. Just used it and it seems to work fine, but I do not have any other test strip to directly compare to in order to check its accuracy."
5,Help for Writers,This book is extremely helpful in terms of discipline when writing.I would highly recommend this book to anyone writing their first or first group of books.
4,Mostly Helpful,"First Draft in 30 Days is an excellent way for anyone such as myself to apply some structure to their writing. The hardest thing for me when writing is to organize myself, and so far thanks to this book, I've been able to accomplish a lot more with my manuscript. My only complaint is that a few of the author's instructions are a little vague and hard to follow, such as the ones on pages 37-40 concerning Summary Outline, Miscellaneous Scene Notes, and Closing Scene Notes. However, I have found the benefits far outweigh any drawbacks and I recommend this book to anyone that struggles as I do with organzing their stories into something coherent and readable."
5,First Draft in 30 days,This is the very best source for struggling writers. The suggestions are clear and undertandable. The only writing book you should need.
3,Boring,I bought this and also the First draft to Finished Novel by same author. Mostly the information rather generic. I found her style to be boring. You can find better books I think.
5,Well laid out plan,"I do agree that maybe the title is somewhat misleading, but I doubt anyone would buy a book called ""30 days to a very detailed outline draft that'll make your book almost write itself while making certain your work is both organized & complete"".The book does a good job of showing the skills every beginning writer needs, from research & broad outlining to organizing & developing a very detailed outline.I'd personally do more than the book assigns each day, but I tend to write constantly when possible. The book does a great job of giving you the skills to write a book the right way.Whether you like the title or not, buy the book & follow the plan. Your book will be better off for it."
5,One of the most important writing reference books ever,"Writing my first mystery took 2 years and about 5 drafts, plus some rewrites of what I thought was the final version. Then I met Karen and found to my amazement that writing in a chaotic way wasn't the only approach. I've never seen anyone so organized.Being Karen's co-author in the Falcon's Bend series, I had the privilege of learning her method by watching her use it as we outlined and wrote three manuscripts.Ever since I've been using Karen's method, my writing career has been soaring. My latest release in Germany sold out within 3 months. The second print run is selling even faster! I finished my last manuscript in under 4 weeks and sold it to a publisher within 2 days. If her method worked for me - chaos personified - it'll work for everyone."
4,So far so good,Haven't finished the book yet or put into practice the formula but already ideas are coming and I can't wait to get started. Very easy to understand and follow.
1,Bad Container,"So the salt is fine, but the poorly designed ""cylinder"" is not very sturdy and today, while pouring some salt into a soup I was making.. the lid came apart from the canister and poured the whole container into my soup... obviously ruining it. Buy something else and save yourself the hassle. It also CAME complete clumped up..."
1,"GREAT product, but WAAAY overpriced.",Please do some comparison shopping. Salt Works sells it for $3.25. And you can find it in stores for much less than this.
3,Good buy for the money,"I would have liked this to be a little bit larger to cover more stovetop area. There was also some separation of wood at the corners. Other than that, it's a good cutting board."
3,New Vision - Same old Kings English,"I have always believed that there is more to the Christ story and the teachings of Jesus than what the ""Church"", since the days of the Council of Nicea, has allowed us to know. And this is what I had hoped that ""The Gospel of the Nazirenes"" offered to us - a fuller truth. And it seems to deliver here.But I was very disappointed by what I found. ""The gospel of the Nazirenes"" is supposed to be a recent find, written in Arameic. Why then did the authors who translated this into English for our understanding resort to the Kings' English of the 17th Century, as if ""just another Kings James Version?"" It seems to me that an authentic find, translated in modern times, should be read in the English common to us today, and not in an ancient form of our language that few truly understand.It makes me question the very validity of this ""New Gospel"", and leaves me disappointed in the new truth it was supposed to deliver."
3,Stupid fat americans,"yes its zebrahead, but it is not called ""japanese tour ep"" it is called ""Stupid Fat Americans"" it has 2 unreleased songs a few live ones a a couple off yellow. my suggestion: skip it unless you love zebrahead. but if thats the case you own Yellow (their independant cd costs about 30 bucks on ebay) and your getting this for i hate x-mas."
5,Great for IBS-D,I've suffered with this condition for years. I found that half an imodean and 3 of these daily relieves it completely.
5,Great value,I am amazed at the size and potiency of this capsole. It is very easy to swallow. Just started busing so I will give another review soon.
1,Needs ALL ingredients listed!,"I ordered this product because it looked like an excellent mix & quantity of probiotics. Unfortunately, the other ingredients weren't listed.

5,"this band has changed its name, fyi","For all of you who are wondering whatever happened to this band, they have changed their name to Citizen's Band Radio. ...As for this album, I found this in a bargain bin and was blown away by it. I played it for everyone I knew and they all were blown away too. The band sounds a lot like the band Live but with a lot more energy in their music. This is possibly one of the greatest albums ever made, I have no idea why this band never became commercially popular. The vocals and guitars are excellent, and the drumming is the best I've ever heard. Everyone owes it to themselves to at least hear this band once, then the music will speak for itself. Big Windshield Little Mirror belongs in any CD collection..."
1,Misrepresentaton,"The photo of this item shows a complete set of vinal weights. It did not give the purchaser the option to select two individual weights. Therefore, the advertisement implied that the purchaser would receive a complete set. However, only 2 weights arrived rather than a full set. If this was truthfully advertised, I would have made another selection which would have represented much better value. I'm very disappointed!"
3,Passing time,"It is a work of interest for interested in cinematography, its history and alike.Not much for an ordinary viewer your author is."
5,Fascinating!,"I am a graduate Counseling student. This book was recommended to me by a professor. It is a short, fascinating read. Soon I will re-read it because it is enjoyable and because there is an immense amount of information in it.Interesting to me as someone who is focusing on Gestalt and experiential work."
5,"Def Leppard Bonus ""YEAH !"" CD With Backstage Interviews!!!!","This is the companion CD to the ""Yeah!!!"" album CD. Buy one if you can find one, it's great. It contains some great interviews of the Band members concerning the ""Yeah !"" Album CD. IT consists of the following:1.American Girl2.Backstage interview #13.Search & Destroy4.Backstage interview #25.Space Oddity6.Backstage interview #37.Dear Friends8.HeartbeatThis is the perfect companion to the Yeah CD, it's part of the Yeah project by Def Leppard. Buy one it you can, You'll Love It!!! Thanks!!!"
5,God Like!,"Okay, this band is so awesome I got ticketsto thewre show but got sick but dude if you are looking for a kicken hardcore band with therehard songs and there soft songs this is the cd for you for a little sample you can see them live in concert on the game 3xtreme i bought the game just for that."
3,A watered down Fear Factory,"Ultraspank's debut does have its moments, I'll give it that, I truely like the songs ""Butter"", ""Wrapped"", ""Slip"" and ""Sponge,"" but they don't save the album from being a weak debut. For one, there could have been more guitar. You really have to turn up the stero loud to even make this sound heavy, its just very muddled. Pete Murray can truely sing, no doubt, but he just bores me to death with choruses with overly long held notes, plus his growls aren't all that good on the heavier songs. Another problem I found was this band loves to build up tension within the songs, making you think they're are going to break into something really heavy by the time the chorus comes, but you are let down by weak guitar and Pete's overly long held notes when it comes. The agressive songs just don't get aggresive enough, the emotional songs just don't get emotional enough for me, make sense? This doesn't include the eighth track ""Sponge"", that song is sad as hell and it rules."
3,hardcore (?),"this cd is not hardcore in the truest sense of the word. the cd does display heavy riffs at times but the voice lacks the power that would associate itself with hardcore. If you are into a softer core of music such as the NEW limp bizkit and korn then this cd is for you. If your roots are in hardcore, this cd is merely background music and nothing spectacular. not a bad record on the whole though."
4,5!,"Good album for those of you out there who like industrial with a ""Toolish"" feel. ""5"" is an incredible song. A must buy for industrial-metal fans."
4,Great stuff from a great band,"Frankly speaking, I was taken in by the intensity of the music they produce. Great thundering rythm and great howling vocals. There's just one thing I dislike with the vocals is that when they try to be melodic with the vocals. But overall, this CD rocks my foundation man...! Hell yeah! . It irritates my neighbour everytime I play it on 10. Great CD through and through."
3,I don't hear any PASSION!,"These guys are fine musicians and have great potential. The great, fatal flaw I see with this band is their lack of real PASSION. All the most respected and loved heavy acts have real PASSION behind their music. I just don't feel it from these guys. It sounds like a lot of rehashed material with spurts of creativity but no PASSION. You could be the most innovative band around, but if you have no PASSION then who cares? It's like ""dressing up a corpse."" What's the point? Look at bands like Machine Head, Earth Crisis, Korn (in their first album), and Vision of Disorder. You can just hear and feel the PASSION in these guys' music. Check 'em out! --Kelly Magovern"
1,... what went wrong!,"Ive been looking forward to this game for about 6 months and finially I found it in store. Unfortuantely, that store wont let me return it!The AI is shocking, the camera controls are next to impossible to use at any descent speed, and I cant get the game to run for more than 10 minutes without a crash to desktop. If you dont believe me, check out the gamespot review below...it sums up my feelings pretty well.Very dissapointed :-("
2,Wasn't what I expected.,"I have a good friend who is a huge Dale Jr. fan and thought this would be an excellent gift. When I got it, the fabric was very thin and the colors were dull instead of bright. For what I got, this item was too pricey. Needless to say, I was disappointed."
1,review of clock,"The order arrived promptly. I was replacing an old GE school house wall clock that was VERY easy to reset. This one is not as the control is behind the face of the clock which has to be removed from high on the wall in order to reset it, ie. if the power goes out. As I am not very tall and I live alone means I have to wait for someone to reset it for me. A reset knob on the bottom of the clock seems more logical."
3,home alone got jealous of radio flyer,"this was good movie for caucklin and wood they both had amazing chemistry together e. wood mom just passed away and his uncle told his father to let him stay few weeks with his cousin (m. caucklin) the father agreed and dropped his son off to spend winter break with the uncle and his family i like how caucklin fooled everyone about him being a great kid and looked at e. wood like he was crazy becaus e wood was trying to convince everyone that m. caucklin was a phony who was dangerous m. caucklin n da movie, he drowned his baby brother in the tub and nearly killed his kid sister in the icing pond mark (e. wood) try to tell his aunt but she didn't belive him until henry ( tried to kill her too at the end of the movie but e. wood came to make the save and m. caucklin got what he did to others this movie was filled with emotion, drama, some fun and action moments to keep u entertained throughout the movie JB's back"
2,The Good Son,"Mark Evans (Elijah Wood) goes to stay with his aunt and uncle after his mother dies. While there, he comes face to face with a blond-haired devil who calls himself his cousin.Macauley Culkin plays a bad seed in this 1993 non-classic. Apparently he was trying to shake off the stigma of his role as Kevin McCallister and the limits it placed on him, artistically, at the tender age of 12. You can't exactly carve out your place in acting history alongside such masters as Robert De Niro and Marlon Brando if all you're going to do in your movies is set booby traps and die by bee sting. So he plays a villain in this, and he does an adequate job, I suppose. I wouldn't say there was anything earth-shattering about his performance, though.From what I've read, the screenplay was written by Ian McEwan. Interesting.I thought this movie was OK. It was nothing special. But for some reason I can't bring myself to get rid of the VHS. It's one of those guilty pleasures, I guess."
5,The Good Son,In this suspense thriller a 12-year-old boy goes to live with relatives after his mother's death and comes under the influence of his malevolent cousin. This movie is wierd and realistic. The way that Culkin's character acts is twisted but sometimes that is how twisted people get. This movie is very suspenseful. The plot was to die for and the acting was astonishing.
3,SCARY THE FRIST TIME,i frist saw this movie in 1993 in the thearter and liked it. i now own but dont like it as much its one of the thriller that dosent seem thrill after repeted views like say the sixth sense does.I think that both mac and elijah did good macauly proved that he can play something besides the bacsic kid role. i think it would be more scary if there roles had flpi flped and eljah was the bad one. the only really bad performance in it is mac sister quinn she just kind of said he lines with out any feeing not that she had that big of a part any how. but hats probaly why this was her onl ymovie apperance.
1,"stick with the classic ""the bad seed"" instead","this must have seemed like a great idea at the time,""cast culkin against type as a killer child and show his range as an actor"". the problem is his range is all the way from a to b.this movie never explains how or why the boy turns killer and asks us to except one too many ""chance"" happenings. in the end all we get is this ""thriller""(and i use the term very loosely)that thinks just the idea of culkin as a killer is thrilling."
2,"Worth A look - - ""A"" (as in one)","It has its moments, few, but it still has them there. I saw it first in 1993 and as a young boy, it did truly scare the wits out of me. But it is not very scary after the first viewing. The ending is always predictable but still rather well done. Yet, Culken is used as if he is the wire hanger. The rest of the crew and cast is the shirt and depends on the wire hanger to hold it up. A cute, young Elijah Wood can be seen in it. The acting is rather lame, but I suppose Culken is okay. You gotta give him atleast a little credit. I mean it was his last decent film."
3,"The Movie is No ""Big Stretch"" for Culkin","Contrary to mass opinion, the character Culkin plays in this film is not that different from his more familiar one in the ""Home Alone"" flicks. The big difference is that in ""The Good Son,"" Culkin is devoid of smiles as he carries out his evil plans. His ""Henry"" is a calculating and self-absorbed child who has no remorse for any of the acts metted on friends and relatives. Although a fairly routine ""thriller,"" the movie benefits from a great Elijah Wood performance as a tormented - in more ways than one - cousin of Henry. His acting makes up for the over-the-top melodrama of Culkin."
3,"GOOD THRILLER ! REMAKE OF ""THE BAD SEED "" ?","I must be getting soft in my old age as I did not like this film all that much years ago when I saw it for the first time. The biggest problem for me is that they really push the believability factor in this one towards the end of this film. Culkin and Wood turn in good performances and it does deliver enough thrills to hold the viewer for the 86 minute running time. Not a bad thriller which is basically a remake of ""The Bad Seed"". The DVD transfer is good."
4,THE GOOD MOVIE!,"This movie was great! Macaulay convinced me, that he really wasa phsycho! How did they make the cliff scene look so real? Thatwas great! The only person I didn't like in this movie, was thewoman who played Macaulays mother. She over acted, and her hugeears got on my nerves! Besides that, this is a great movie!"
5,Good As It Is Ten Years Ago,"This movie came out when I was graduating from high school and I saw it back years ago. Just last night I saw the movie with my mother and she was aghast at what this kid could do. As she pointed out, ""he is purely evil"" and said he needed the psychologist rather than Mark, his cousin.Mark, the cousin, was sent by his father to stay with his aunt and uncle for a couple of weeks due to the death of his mother and his father's business trip. Things go well between Mark and Henry. But as Mark hangs around his cousin, he sees that the boy is capable of hurting anyone. He even tries to kill his sister. No one believes him. They assume that he going through a traumatic period because of his mother's death.What were the motivations that caused Henry to kill? Why do kids kill? Those are questions to be asked and understood.This was as good as it was ten years ago."
3,"IF I LET YOU GO, DO YOU THINK YOU CAN FLY????",I would have liked it a lot more if Elijah Wood died too
1,I hated this violent movie!,It stars Macaulay Culkin and I did not like the way the filmwas created. Because I did not like to see the violence in thatfilm! The worst part is when henery throws his sister connieon the thin ice and she almost drowned that part [made me mad]!all in all this move is horriable and I would suggest that anychildren or underage or even adults with love for kids and people do not see this movie at all! I think the producer shouldbe punshied ... for making that movie!!!
1,Wrong model number - you get shorted 2 filters.,"The 1 star is NOT for the quality but for the error in the description. Please do not make the same mistake I did and order this thinking you are receiving 3 filters. You only recieve 1.Date written: July 25, 2005.I have pointed this out to Amazon today so they may change the description so no one else makes this mistake."
4,Awkward plug-in but quiet and durable unit,"The unit is loud enough to create white noise for sleeping or the office but not so loud as to disturb others. Doesn't work as well if you are plugging it in just above a baseboard as the prongs are just above the fan in back. The unit should extend the prongs past the back of the motor or place them below it so the unit can plug in flush with a wall. Overall, though, an excellent choice for its size and noise level when you don't want something sitting on your workspace or dresser."
3,Very good if you like the texture,"This sausage is covered in a sort of edible mold-like substance similar to brie cheese. It's a part of the curing process and imparts a delicious flavor to the sausage. In addition, this is a very well-dried sopressata--which I like. However, the texture isn't all that good. There are hard things in it which don't seem like meat--tough, almost like little pieces of leather. If the texture was good, I'd give this delicious sausage five stars--but because the texture is a turn-off for me, it only rates a three in my book. If you don't mind little touch hard chunks in your sausage, and love a rich, complex flavor, you'll probably love Molinari's sopressata."
1,"If you like hard, tasteless and expensive.................","..........then choose this product. I know to expect a really dry, firm texture, but I could barely cut this product. Once I did saw off a piece of it, it was like eating leather..........oily leather. I wouldn't recommend........"
4,Same old stuff,"This game is good if you have never played the series before. It is the same as the other Unreal games. The map editor is very over rated. If you have a degree in engineering and math you might be able to draw a box. If not, dont plan on having any fun making your own maps. I have a P4 2.4 GHZ, 64Mb DDR graphics card and 512 DDR Ram and this still plays very slow. It has to be the game not the pc. Wait for the price to drop."
2,Terrible!,"The original Unreal Tournament was great. The announcing voice came on at appropriate times. In the new one, it states obvious facts and gets annoying, fast. The old game had better weapons, and also had better skins. What's up with the guys in robot shells? Anyways, UT Gold was, and always will be, the best!"
1,This game has taken 1st person shooter backwards,"What happened to all the great, somewhat realness we found in unreal tournament? This game has taken us backwards and in my opinion might as well be called Quake IV. To the creators: WHAT WERE YOU THINKING??? Bring back good old fashioned unreal tournament in the next version you make, and second: quit designing them for high end video cards. That is the biggest turnoff for buying this game."
4,I recommend highly.,"This game is really a great game. The graphics/gameplay are topnotch. If your looking for some strait up deathmatch or CTF, look no further, just pick up a copy of UT2003. I've been hooked since it arrived."
1,Repulsive...,"This game is a cross between ""Pro"" wrestling, and an online thug trainer. It's packed with cursing voices, tinged with an ebonic accent, blood, and gender confused female figures. It plays like the headlines...""Semi-literate, afri-cultural hooligans shoot each other..""Just what America needs..Avoid at all costs"
2,Sounds Effects Not Nearly As Good As Unreal Tournament,"When Unreal Tournament came out a few years ago, I was amazed not only by the graphics and smooth gameplay, but also by the sounds effects. The sounds were so good, they made your spine tingle. So clear, so loud, and so well defined. When you fired a weapon, you knew it was going to sound good and rock the walls of your room.The same cannot be said for Unreal Tournament 2003. The weapons sound downright bland and boring. It is amazing that the game's developers would allow such a game to be released knowing that it's sounds are not nearly as good as its previous release.The only hope for UT2003 in terms of sound quality is if a sound upgrade pack is offered for it as a free download."
1,Just Eye Candy,"I played the demo and couldn't believe it sucked. So I called a friend who had the game to play for myself the full version and it still sucked.This is a Quake 3 rip-off. If I wanted Quake I'd go buy that. UT2k3 is all graphics and nothing else. It makes me wonder what they packed into the 2+ gigs this monstrousity takes on the harddrive. Even the original doom plays better. Developers have to understand that graphics don't make a game (just as special effects don't necessarily make a good movie). It is like finding out the prettiest guy/girl in college has gum disease, herpes, half rotten teath, and a stink issue. Good to look at, but you wouldn't want to touch it."
3,One Of The More P.O.ing Games Of This Year,"I read about Unreal Tournament 2003 in p.c. gamer, and i remember promises of 'huge destructible enviroments' and 'a two person skiff'. So far, after purchasing it for 50 bucks, i have seen no signs of either the skiff or the 'huge enviroment.' I'm not p.o.ed about the skiff, but come on, skiffing is my life, if they take away the skiff... what next, THE GUNS. I mean the graphics are great and the gameplay, realistic, but THERES NO SKIFFING. I HAVE BASED MY LIFE AND MY RELIGION AROUND THAT REVIEW, waiting for the game to come out-with a skiff-but alas, no skiff. Where has the world gone when you can promise-but not deliver-the skiff. IS THERE NO END TO THE TORTURE."
1,Terrible,"This is nothing like what it tries to be. It's got extremely spammy weapons, terribly sloppy physics and the graphics and lighting are a joke. For example, you see shadows, but the objects for the shadows don't exist. The water is totally fake and jello (not even bubbles) and the lighting is all out of place. The double jumping is really fake feeling and the adrenaline power ups everyone absolutely hates. Plus, there is no cheat protection like Quake 3 has (PunkBuster).In fact, this game tries to be like Quake 3 and fails miserably with poor physics, terrible graphics, and spammy gameplay.If you want a truly intense first person shooter, with better weapon balance, and very solid physics and graphics, just get Quake 3!"
2,"Exciting at first, but dies a quick death","At first this game really blew me away. The graphics and sound are impressive and the gameplay, and weapons in particular, are very cool. The novelty soon wears off though. The game is now gathering dust on my hard drive (hmmmm... I really should get that looked at), and once I completed the single player mode and got tired of multi-player, it didn't look like such a wise investment. I actually don't think the gameplay is particularly interesting long-term, and it all feels pretty ""samey"" after a while, but that's just my opinion. If you're a multi-player freak and have a good connection, you'll probably get a lot of fun out of playing online, at least for a while."
3,Good game but wait if your getting it now,"The reason i say wait is because they are making a sequal in i think the end of October. I like the overall playing of the game and the graphics. I also like the whole theme that the whole thing is a sport with spectators like wrestling. But i found that a few levels where a little harder than the general uprising of difficulty, The editor i can't figure out. Hopefully they'll make it a little easier like warcraft 3's editor. Also online play is extremely hard and i mean EXTREMELY. I think that they should make like levels like if you've finished your game up to novice, Your in a certain difficulty, But if your finished up to GODLIKE in the game then you with everyone of your own difficulty, that way the online play is easier for the worse players and is better practice."
4,"Good game,if you can run it","This is without a doubt the best shooter I've ever played, but my computer [is] completely [bad], so the game runs like a person without legs. A major diappointment, but overall a great game."
2,"Engine is great, but that's about it.","The people who worked on the engine and graphics for UT 2003 deserve the credit. They put out a top-notch product that can be customized heavily (modders rejoice!). However, they seriously lacked in gameplay and in new ideas. It is almost EXACTLY the same as its predecessor, Unreal Tournament (with minor alterations on weapons such as the minigun and the addition of the game mode Bombing Run). You can spend your money on this if you want, but I would rather have spent my money on a game that has innovative gameplay over a game with only new graphics and engine."
1,YOURE KIDDING,"Please, anyone who played the original Unreal will know that they took away all the cool stuff and emphasized the crap !Gone is the wonderful sniper rifle.Gone is the balance between all weapons (now 2 weapons are superpowerful)Gone is the stearable Redeemer (the new one steers like a bus)Gone is realistic movements (one second hes there, next hes not)Gone is any skillThis game sucks, online and off. Only the bombing run (online) is slightly fun, but is always screwed by guys who make the teams unbalanced."
2,Intense action...when you can get it to work.,"If you like first person shooters, this game is fantastic. I bought because of how much I liked the previous version.Unfortunately, I have never played this game without it crashing on me. I have upgraded to the latest patch (2166) and upgraded my video card to the latest driver. I have also installed the XP Service Pack 1 which has the DirectX 8.1b upgrade. I have every graphics setting set to the lowest setting possible. I am running a Pentium 4 2.53mhz with 512 megs RAM.It crashes all the time, telling me I may need to upgrade my DirectX driver. Sometimes it doesn't even start. I haven't started with support yet, but it's aggravating nonetheless that i should be having so many problems.I would stay away from this game. I know several people who own this game, they all have similar problems, but not as many. That's probably because they have newer graphics cards.In short, this game is really buggy."
3,Unreal is Quake,"The reason I liked Unreal is that it was not like Quake. Not the frantic, run and gun style play, but more ""sophisticated"" killing fun.The new Unreal has become Quakeish.Bummer.Battlefield 1942 for me now..."
2,Disappointing,"The long-anticipated revolution never came.With Doom 3 and Half-Life 2 (the next generation in FPS's) endlessly delayed, the gaming world turned its hopeful eyes to Unreal Tournament 2003. And finished with nothing.I must preface this by saying that I always preferred Quake 3 Arena to Unreal Tournament, but this is bad even for that franchise. The gameplay is slow, the highly reviewed 'realistic lighting' is all but non-existant, and the AI couldn't hit an elephant with a cannon at 3 feet.If you're looking for a new thrill, relive Quake 3 on Nightmare, wait for Doom 3, and save your pennies."
4,Great Fun And Had More Mods Than 2004,This was good fun and had some really nice mods going that never ported to UT2K. I still fire it up occasionally for the dark mods.
4,great game demands a great video card..,"Unreal Tournament 2003 is by far the most visually impressive game of the year. However to get those impressive graphics at a playable framrate you're going to need a fast graphics card. I've seen several reviews from people saying the game was slow even on their modern 1Ghz+ machine with a geforce 2/4 card.UT2003 needs the best graphics card you can throw at it. Anything less than an ATI Radeon 7500 Pro (the one with DDR memory) or a GeForce4 MX440 (*not* the 420) just won't cut it. In fact you'd be better off with a Radeon in this game than anything else.The CPU is much less important to this game. I've been able to run it at a very stable 30 Frames Per-Second on an Athlon 650Mhz with 192Mb RAM and an ATI 7500 Pro video card at 800x600x32. However, if you want to see the true beauty of this game engine shine through, you're going to need a much faster CPU and a better graphics card. (I'd reccomend an Athlon 2500+ and Radeon 7500 pro or better)"
5,Priest Reviews UT2k3,So this is like... a fighting game right? And you shoot stuff... And stuff shoots back. There are some robots and other stuff. This game pzoned Quake 1 to 37829 and don't even talk about countersuck! hahaha leet ownt!
3,Unreal Tournament 2003,"Nice game, limited in scope, not as fun as TRIBES, TRIBES 2, or even TRIBES Vengeance. But still a great lan game to play with friends and family."
2,Lacking the Unreal Challenge,"Although the Graphics in Unreal Tournament 2003 are excellent the game lacked the one on one challenge I experienced with the orginal Unreal Tournament. Here you can only run and shoot, no strategy needed, no making a stand with a snipper riffle."
5,Different than UT and still a lotta fun,We've all heard the complainers saying it's not UT. Well... it's not. But how exciting would that be? We've had UT for 3+ years. UT2k3 is a good evolution (not revolution)and is fun to play. After you buy it. try it out online. They'll have several servers for the original UT and UT2k3 then judge for yourself
3,NOT GAME OF THE YEAR MATERIAL HERE,"I downloaded the demo and it's fun but it's nothing shockingly new. UT2003 is an average FPS as I see it. I applaud the graphics but that alone will not earn it GOTY. There is hardly anthing new that makes it unique from previous FPS. Halo and Battlefield 1942 was revolutionary. The bar has been raised. Vehicles and planes should come standard in all FPS now. This was basically a major enhancement of the original UT, a mindless search and destroy game. If you actually want to use your neurons and you have the computer to handle it, get Battlefield 1942. BF1942 has many bugs but the fact that it's an original WW2 game with ships, planes, tanks, and vehicles has a better chance at GOTY."
2,Don't expect the same feeling as UT,"I agree with Peter. This game gave me a feeling of Quake which I never liked. I should have checked the demo at unreal2003.com before bying this as I assumed that this would be better technology but similar to UT. I miss the bow, sniper and some realistic weapons as well as maps. It was fun playing dm-bathroom , morpheus etc. in UT.Multiplayer connection/lookup is faster."
2,Dissapointing...,"This games boasts more of an engine than an actual game. I don't doubt the engine's capabilities, it does render gorgeous graphics and the polygon count on the models are very impressive. But it would seem to me that the developers spent more time on the engine development than on the gameplay design. It has not changed much from the original Unreal Tournamnent and I found the gameplay to be repetitive and monotonous. The only ""breath-of-fresh-air"" in this game is ""Bombing Run"", but it still won't improve my overall impression of this game.In a nutshell, this game is BORING."
2,need to go back to the computer board,Unreal 03 to me is not so unreal..weopons are ok..not nearly as good as original unreal..graphics are awesome.do not like new sniper rifle. It's like a Buck Rogers nightmare..I wish they had just enhanced original unreal tournament a little bit..I think they went a little overboard.. not really what I was expecting it to be.But the graphics are awesome..thak you NVIDIA..for at least putting in good graphics....Thanks but I'll stick to the original unreal tournament..it kicks A--
2,Chris,"Its just not worth it, the guns are terrible the game is bad. It takes too much to run. I have a geforce4 TI 4400 and its a little laggy at medium graphics. I think Infogrames shot themselves in the foot with this one. Stick to the older unreal, it holds up much better. Save your money buy something else."
3,"Ok, I guess","Whatever, its not great. It is not realistic at all, nor does it try to be. You run at incredibal speeds, take punishment that seems more sutable for a tank, and there are all sorts of powerups around the ring. But it does offer a relief from games like Counter-Strike. Its always fun playing futuristic FPS's, where you wield massive guns, and wear giant power suits, but it gets old fast. Also, because its entirely tournament based, your introduced to all the weapons the first time you play, so once youve seen them all, its sort of like, ""Oh... thats it?"" but whatever. Since its only $20, I would say buy it, but if it were any more expensive, it wouldnt be worth it."
3,Disapointing,"This game is a big disappointment. There are not that many levels, and many of the levels are just re-hashes of the same old thing. Granted, the game engine is beautiful and plays nicely - but I was expecting more. The enemy bots still play well in deathmatch, but are terrible in team games. The game was also released with bugs."
2,totally unreal..cop out,"Come you guys..I love this game..the origanal unreal tournament.You ruined it..do not like the new sniper gun..DAAAHHHHH..it just gave away my position with it's lightning flash..but graphics are awesome..thanks to NVIDIA.just does not measure up to original unreal..I usually listen to Metallica while playing unreal and have the best time..Especially ""For whom the bell tolls""..But now Metallica's music does'nt go with any of these Buck rogers maps..or weopons .What happened to the maps..they are small..total cop out guys..Quit trying to be Quake..Be UNREAL..thats what got me to be a unreal freak..I would have better fun using these cd's from unreal 03 to play frisbys with my dog..Again thank you NVIDIA for at least putting fourth the effort for great graphics.I just wish they had enhanced the original unreal a little bit...thanks but i'll stick to the original unreal..IT KICKS!"
3,just a quake knock-off,"I loved UT, and will continue to play it. The people are larger and more realistic in UT, and I am disappointed with UT2003. Something is missing and the announcer is annoying. UT was classy, and this is just (while the details are great) in a word, lame. I'll play it, cuz I sunk some hard earned cash into it, but i'm disappointed nontheless."
2,Poorly done - Basically C# for Dummies,"I've been using C# for 3 years, but purchased this book hoping to glean some new stuff on C# and .NET. Boy, was I disappointed. I own many MS Press titles from Richter, Petzold, Prosise, etc. and have been ecstatic about them all. However, this author definitely is not included in that list and shouldn't be writing professional books. I know that he used to write the ""dummies"" level books and it definitely shows in this attempt. The information is nothing short of a rehashing of MSDN material with absolutely nothing added. Very disappointing."
2,Poor reference,"I have read in the reviews of this book that it's geared towards the intermediate/advanced developer. I disagree! This book is orientated towards the beginner. If you're a seasoned professional in a language such as VC++, then I recommend that you bypass this poorly written book as you'll be done with it in a few weeks!"
2,"Too much extraneous staff, irrelevant to the C# language","The first couple of chapters gave a decent introduction to C#, but later on the book strayed away to include things like ado.net, windows forms, etc. Not that there is anything inherently wrong with this, but the author utterly failed to make these *extra* chapters a value-add.If you think about it, the c# language itself is a large enough topic, as are ado.net, windows forms, web forms etc. It's a herculean task to single-handedly pack them all into one title and cover everthing well. The author is apparently stretching himself too thin by taking on such a big assignment, and could have done a much better job by sticking to c# itself."
4,Enumerator example has a lapsed listener problem,"Overall I think this book makes a good reference. In chapter 7, I like the point about being careful to invalidate the enumerator if the underlying data gets changed. However, be aware the example has a ""lapsed listener"" problem. When the enumerator object is no longer needed, how is it supposed to be unsubscribed from the Changed event? If it never gets unsubscribed, then the garbage collector will not be able to remove it from the heap, thus you end up with a memory leak. Using System.WeakReference is one way to solve this problem."
2,Crystal blah,"In my book the true test of a Prince album (like any album) is, ""how much do I listen to it?"" The answer here is not much. Prince has long been known for his excesses, and this 4-disc set is no exception. In my view the far superior ""Emancipation"" was two incredible CDs needlessly stretched into three; here we have about 1.5 CDs worth of great music excruciatingly elongated into 4. There are, of course, some great songs here: lovesign, rippopgodazipper, and a few others, but for the most part I'd put them in the category of failed experiments."
4,4 the hardcode Prince funkateers only!,"If Crystal Ball is a Prince album you've been deliberating on and you're a big-time fan, go get it. There are real gems on here that make the price worth it. Everything is in the bag here; rock, funk, blues, dance, R & B, reggae, and jazz. Sure, there are throwaways, but the sleepers are keepers. ""Movie Star"" is my favorite track of all, a hilarious Morris Day-esque tale of club hopping and panty snatching that's all cool, slinky funk. Every disc should give you at least 5 or 6 joints to royally jam out. ""Days Of Wild"" and ""The Ride"" are showstopping live performances that will make you go see him the next time he's in town if you already haven't. The biggest test of all is ""Cloreen Bacon Skin,"" a 15-minute freestyle jam between Prince and Morris that consists solely of bass and drums. If you can get with this song you'll be laughing your ass off towards the end when Prince asks ""Is this where you live, Alfred? Oh, this is a nasty place, this is NASTAY!!"""
5,Funky Outtakes Compilation from Prince!,"Just what it is.4 CDs of the funkist outtakes I've ever heard.BTW, love that sped up voice that Prince uses on many of the songs including the title track. I believe it's the same effect Stevie Wonder used on some of his early '70s work (ex. Maybe Your Baby).Great stuff!"
3,typical prince of the last 10 years hit and miss,this album pretty much is prince the past decade half good half bad.back in the 80's a multi set from this genius would have been all that but now adays it's run of the mill with him.the only reason that this is hit and miss is cuz this combines his dominant 80's stuff with his mostly wack 90's junk.sadly the way things are going memories may be all that's left of a once powerful force.he will always be a genius but it appears he has settled for whatever and that's not good.
3,Needs help,There is some great music on here. The man's biggest problem is that he needs an editor. This set proves that.
5,great fun,My 17 month old grandchild loves this. She watches The Wizard of every week. She loves the movie and has quite a lot of Oz stuff. She enjoys this sticker book so much I'm going to order a couple more . I think the age recomendation for ages 4-5 is to old. Younger children who watch the movie will want this to play with. I suggest to go ahead and order 2.
2,wizard of oz sticker picture,"This was only an OK product. The layout was good, but the stickers were flimsy. The product description made us think that the ""reusable"" stickers were more durable than they were. The 3-5 year olds that used it had fun with it, but not for long."
2,Disappointed,"The description of this product is misleading. This is NOT an activity book, or even a sticker book. It is a one-page fold-out scene with reusable stickers to place on it. I bought it as a birthday gift for a Wizard of Oz birthday party, and I was disappointed given how much of a chunk it took out of my gift budget. That said, the stickers really are pretty, and the recipient loved it,"
2,Not Worth The Money,Save your money there's nothing to this book. They use the term reusable stickers not really. We used this as a party favor & each childs stickers were ruined after one time & these were delicate girls not rough boys.
2,Wizard of Oz,"This product was OK. The characters are a little ""different""looking but the children had fun with it for about five minutes."
2,QUALITY COULD BE BETTER,"The book is large, however the quality is poor. The stickers are supposed to be removable so you can put different stickers on at different times--there's too many to use all at once. The stickers tore easily, even when I was trying to be very careful when removing them. This is a great concept (especially with Wizard of Oz items being hard to find) however the quality could be much better."
1,Not reccomended,"I received this book for my daughter, thinking you could put the stickers on and remove them to place in the ""book"" elsewhere, but when you do, they rip, not as it says, (with 27 reusable stickers). It's only a one page book. We can't use it now, because the stickers are all ripped, so guess there goes some more money down the tube! I don't reccomend anyone wasting their money on this."
3,Just A Mediocre Wu Album,"Cappas album has a few interesting tracks (Slang Editorial, Run) but on the whole the album just drags on and on and falls short of even Cappadonnas lyrical standards"
3,CAPPA IS DA MAN,I LIKED CAPPA'S CD IT WAS TIGHT...FORGET WHAT VIBE SAID ABOUT MY MAN HE'S DOPE...WAIT UNTIL HIS NEW JOINT DROPS THEN JUDGE...COMING THIS SUMMER...
2,Cappa Proves He's Light on Skill.,"Cappa had mad promise from his dope, dope verses on different Wu projects (Winter Warz...DAMN!) But his performance on this and on ""Wu Tang Forever"" prove that he ain't really that dope. Their are a few dope tracks on this like ""Black Boy,"" ""Everything Is Everything,"" ""Splish Splash,"" and a few others. This is where most people realized that everything with a ""W"" on it was not exactly bound to be dope. Cappa doesn't have the power as an MC to carry an album himself."
4,Surprisingly good first solo album...,"Tight mix of different sounds and flows in all the tracks. Most are great like Run and Dart Throwing. A surprise was Young Hearts,nice singing by Blue Raspberry. Cappadon representing Park Hills and the Wu to the max."
3,wu-tang kicks @$$,"cappadonna did ok with this one but it wasnt kick @$$ like i thought it would be. after hearin him on "" only built 4 cuban linx"" and ""ironman"" i thought this cd was gonna be great . i still encourage people to buy it though, songs like milk that cow, dart throwin and everything is everything are reasons enough to buy it"
2,What Happened?,"I really thought this album was gonna be tight, but after the first few songs it gets boring. When I listen to this album in the car only two tracks get play after that I'm popping in another CD. After 3 plays in my car I was bored of this CD and never played it again."
1,weak,"Save your dough, Wu made on small mistake and this album is it. He's got zero skillz next to the rest of the clan. Buy at your own risk"
2,kinda holds together,"you really shouldn't touch this album until you have all the regular wu-tang releases, all the killarmy releases, and all the pre-2000 wu solo releases (except for possibly method man)."
4,Cappadonna - The Pillage,"Cappadonna IS on point on this album in all aspects. Its just I dont really think its classic 5 star material. But I give it about a 4.5 EASILY. Cappadonna's flow and rhymes are on point every line and verse on each track he speaks on. Good appearences also by the Wu-Tang Clan! The production, is pretty grimey in most spots, only a COUPLE tracks where I thought the beats were decent and not THAT great. But I was feeling all of them despite that. If you've heard Cappadonna's sh** from Wu-Tang joints and liked it, this album is definately for you. All of Cappa's good sh** in THIS album. Check it out.My Top 5 Songs1.Slang Editorial2.Run3.Supa Ninjaz4.Milk The Cow5.South Of The Border"
4,cappachino at his finest...,"Pillage is a classic because Cappa was young, hungry, & disected every word. Production was also impeccable it's one of the albums you can listen to all the way through... PeaCe."
2,ehh...,"I didn't really like this cd, Let's just say it wasn't my cup o' tea. I heard this was there best album, so I bought it, not hearing any of the songs on here. But I actually bought it used for about 4 bucks, so I guess it was worth it. There were a few catchy songs on here like 'Angry days' and 'Mr. Coffee'. But I don't like this CD that much, I can see why other people could, because they are very talented, the drumming is awesome. I actually like later Lagwagon better..."
4,"a bit of punk, a bit of metal","To me, i always hear this album and think that Lagwagon must have started out as a hair metal band (look at the pictures inside!), somehow fell into the punk scene, and took it from there. If you're only familiar with Lagwagon's new stuff, this will surprise you, in a good way. But if you've never heard Lagwagon before, I suggest you get Hoss first."
3,it's ok,"Not the best lagwagon cd, but it's still alright. The best song on this cd mr.coffee. The later lagwagon cd's are better, but any lagwagon fan should have, or get this cd. Not the best, but still a good cd."
2,Sorry but this album is pure poop,"I bought this cd because one of my friends liked them and I figured that there was a reason why. So I picked it up, thinking that Lagwaggon would rule and stuff. Nope. This album is just bad music. Sure Angry Days is listenable, and the remake of Bad Moon Rising is novel, but other then that, save your money. I hear that newer Lagwaggon stuff is good. But I've been scorn for life from this cd."
2,"awkward ""on-off"" button location","We purchased this wireless foot pedal to use with our SP Riptide. The unit works anywhere in our 17' boat. We only use our bow mount intermittently as we drift along the river's edge. The position of the on-off switch in the upper right corner of unit makes it very awkward when compared to the corded foot pedals we had on other Minn Kota's. With those, the motor would stop when we released our foot. Likely we will go back to a corded foot pedal. We probably would not have purchased it to start with if the web pictures had shown descriptions of each button's function."
4,MINN-KOTA WIRELESS FOOT PEDAL,"BOUGHT THIS ITEM NOT KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT IT, THERE WERE NO REVIEWS AND DID NOT KNOW ANYBODY THAT HAD ONE. I HAVE THE GARAGE DOOR STYLE REMOTE WHICH WORKS GOOD BUT THE BUTTONS SEEM TO SMALL FOR ME. IVE HAD THIS FOR ABOUT 20 HOURS OF FISHING AND IT WORKS GREAT ALL AROUND THE BOAT (I HAVE A 19FT CC) PROS NO CABLES. CONS THE THROTTLE PEDALS TAKE SOME GETTING USED TO AS THEY ARE VERY CLOSE TOGEATHER. OVERALL I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS UNIT."
3,Don't buy this lens for more that $125,The only reason I bought this lens was that it was $60 at a Ritz Clearance sale. For that price this lens is amazing. For more than that...meh.Chromatic aberration is bad. It's not terribly sharp (I.e. stop down to f8 for your sharpest pics) and the auto focus is slow. build quality ain't the greatest either.This is the same as the Tamron 70-300mm. It has simply be re-badged as a quantaray. If you check the EXIF data on your pictures with this lens you will see that it says Tamron.
3,better than trying to find a person your level online,this cd is great and lets you not waste time setting up the board and is a great opponent at all times. it increased my rating by about 300 and i will always remember it
2,Back Cover,"Why wouldn't Ryan Forrester accept the face that Devan's writing career was over? She couldn't continue to write about something she didn't understand. It was that simple. Her books were about love-and Devan was a failure at love. She knew that Ryan was a brilliant editor, sensitive and fair. She didn't know that he was also a tough, hard driving man, capable of tracking Devan to her secluded hideout in rurual Maine-and staying there until he'd forced her to begin writing again. And loving again."
4,Ignore the other review! Formatting is fine,"Despite what the other reviewer claims, this text formats fine, at least on a Kindle 3. I rate it only four stars only because it does not have a link to the table of contents. You must go to the cover, and page down. Other than that, this is a good text and great value."
4,Fabulous writer,My husband and I both enjoy Conrad's books. It gives insight into the past. The books about the sea are particularly good.
1,Font doesn't read well.,"Why, oh why, would they use Courier or what appears to be a fixed-width font? It's impossible to read, I had to make the text as large as possible, and then you only get 3-4 words pero line, any smaller text options are really tiring to read. That's why I rate it 1 Star.Obviously Joseph Conrad is a genius, and his works all deserve 5 stars, specially Heart of Darkness."
5,FastonJackson,"Years ago I bought this for my wife, now an ex. I liked it so much that my girlfriend is going to get one for Christmas - Please don't tell."
5,DAMNNNNN!!...THIS CD IS UNREAL......,"YO YO PEOPLE!!IF YOU GUYS ARE LOOKING FOR SOME SERIOUS HIP/HOP/SOUL ATTITUDE AND ALL OF THAT...WELL, THIS IS THE CD!! OFF THE HOOK!...LIKE SERIOUSLY...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!...LB..."
1,Does not work with Windows Vista,"I have purchased the 1TB version. When I connected it to a computer running with Windows Vista, computer does not recognize it. I contacted Lacie, they made me do a lot silly things like trying other cables and other computers. After doing an internet search, I found that others and a review also reported that this drive does not work with Vista. I thought it was very unethical for Lacie not to tell me up front that it does not work and maybe I should return it. They claim it does work. As soon as I confronted the technical support with the review that Lacie specification is not correct, they answered with that I should open another ticket for that complaint. What a waste of time and money. I would not recommend this product. Certainly, Lacie is a suspect for any product decision. I would take their specification and claims at face value."
1,Impossible read,"I have read and enjoyed thousands of Sci-Fi books - hard Sci-Fi that is; I don't like fantasy at all. This book reads like the worst fantasy book ever - dozens of complex characters with impossible names to remember are introduced way too fast with way too much detail. Then there are the maddening lengthy descriptions of the impossibly intricate sensory and illusory, cumputerized systems creating the characters (mostly their avatars), their environments and everything else. Its way too easy to lose any perspective on what is reality. Imagine a fantasy writer tripping on LSD - this is the Sci-Fi book he might write."
5,Don't Step on the Flowers of the Desert (title in English),"In a crowded bar overlooking the sea, the local Italian college crowd was enjoying their weekend. A man played guitar and people had their conversations at their tables. When the man with the guitar started playing ""Resta Cu' mme"" (track seven of this great cd), the entire crowd stopped their conversations and sang along to the beautiful song that asks a girl simply and lovingly to ""stay here with me""."
4,A wealth of information!,"As a black investor, I found this book to be a virtual roadmap to financial independance. Juliette Fairley should be praised for bringing together these experts who elaborate not only on their success stories but also on the way to financial freedom. I have recommended this book to my friends. It's beautiful!"
2,"cool machine, but not reliable","I have three of these machines. They create a new one every year and I have bought three of them. They are fun and cool and a riot, however, I have had to hot wire each and every one of them to get them to continue to work after the first month. The on/off switches are junk. I hot wire them and then turn them on and off by removing the battery. Yes, it is a pain in the butt, but these are so cool."
3,Just dont!,"Great bubble machine if you like a goopy bubble mess with each refill if your nerves last that long,actual bubble cartridge slips out an comes loose increasing the mess factor. Better to go to Wal-Mart where it is easily returnable"
4,Great Little Bubble Machine,I baught this over a year ago to keep my dog busy. (He loves bubbles) I have left it in the yard the entire time and it still works.
2,"Awesome, at first!","I picked this up because my kids love bubbles. I worked nicely and became a favorite. I think it got the big head, though because it quickly decided it was too good to work. It stopped working properly and began clicking and the wheel turned. It wasted a lot of bubble fluid also. I was upset when it completely stopped working around 4-5 weeks after purchasing. This equated to maybe 10-12 days it was actually used...If you're looking for a good, reliable bubble maker, consider 'Amazing Bubbles Bubble Generator ' here on Amazon. It as lasted me near 7 months now."
2,"Okay, but","It works great out of the box, but as soon as my grandchildren start handling it, it stops working properly. This is my second one, and I don't think I will be purchasing a third. The wheel keeps getting jammed in one position until it stops producing bubbles completely. I can't seem to get it back to it's original condition. Sorry (as are my grandchildren)."
4,"Great, but needs a lot of bubble fluid",I've only used this machine once so far and it works great. You'll save yourself a lot of hassle by ordering a large bottle of bubble fluid to go with it. The bottle that comes with the machine lasted all of 4 minutes and I'm not exaggerating at all. This machine uses a lot of the bubble fluid in order to create the gazillions of bubbles. It's the end of summer now so I can't find a refill bottle locally even though I live in a big city. I ended up ordering the refill bottle from Amazon. Having to buy such expensive bubble fluid makes the bubble machine double in price. I washed the machine after I used it and will update this review if it stops working upon its next use.
2,DISAPPOINTING AFTER A FEW USES!,"This toy is great at first, after a few uses it stopped working,I cleaned the inside and the battery compartment out of all solution and it still did not work. I did not overfill just stopped working. Good for a cheap thrill that is about all:O)"
5,Well worth it!,"We love this toy! I bought it for my 5 year old daughter and she just cant get enough. She has been playing with it non stop for days now,(Buy extra bubble solution!). Her favorite thing to do is dance around in the constant curtain of bubbles and pretend she is a bubble fairy,My 9 year old son even enjoys this toy, he likes to practice his karate kicks by kicking the bubbles. I think I will buy this toy as a gift for every summer birthday we go to this year!"
1,sadly disappointed,"I was so excited to find a bubble maker this late in the season, however I was sadly disappointed (and my kids too) when this quit working after the first day. Don't waste your money. It's junk!"
5,Best Bubble machine for the price,"Ignore comments >2 years old. The machine was redesigned and most complaints fixed.Use upside-down bottle if you are going to let it run until empty. Otherwise, pour solution into tray as needed. If you move the machine with a non-empty upside-down bottle, it will always spill some. Rinse out the tray after each use (easy).Bubbles are ~1"" diameter. Works with other solutions, but Gazillion Bubbles solution is the best. The kids love it.Not perfect, but I consider it by far the best bubble machine for the money."
2,"Cheap, Broke, BEWARE","This item worked a couple of times, then died...Kids were very excited to play with this, then equally upset when it no longer functioned after a couple of tries."
5,lots of fun,"This bubble machine is great. My 4year old helps to fill it, he turns it on and bubbles every where. Even our two dogs get in on the act. It's great fun for summer time."
4,Patsy Wilson,"My grand children love this toy, especially our 20 month old. I have ordered one for the 20 month old, one to give as a gift and one for our house from them to play with when they visit. They have played with it so much it has stopped running. Will order another to replace it."
3,Stopped working after a few uses.,"This is a really cool bubble machine. We paid $25 at a private toy shop, since Toysrus didn't have anything like this at the time. My 6 month old loved it and we would put it on occassionally for her. One day a neighborhood kid was playing with it and the bubble solution overflowed. We rinsed it out, but didn't realize that the battery compartment was not sealed. Later when it didn't work and we went to change the batteries, everything was corroded. We just found another one at Toysrus us, this time for only $10, and we're going to be more careful. Still a great toy, and I'm sure if it breaks we'll just buy another one, but they really should change the design to protect the batteries."
1,Complete Waste of Time and Money,This is a poor quality barely functional product. At first use it had issues. It comes with a weak fan that has a hard time blowing and I often had to turn the machine off and let it rest a while in order for it to work. This machine also doesn't work well on flat surfaces. I had to physically hold it up in the air at an angle in order for it to push any bubbles out and even that only worked for short periods at a time. I would not recommend this product for anyone and suggest that you look at other brands before wasting your time with this one. Save yourself the hassle and avoid this product.
1,Tom's review,This product is really cheap and not worth the $[...].I had accidentally purchased two of these and found out that it cost $[...] to send back a cheap $[...] toy.The bubble mixture spills out everywhere.The bubbles only go about 2 feet away and then fall and pile up on the floor.Not worth $[...].
3,"Great fun, but not long lasting",I've been through 10 of these bubble machines! They are great for about 3-5 uses and then they either need batteries replaced or just don't work. The problem with these machines are the batteries are either in the back or on the bottom. If the batteries get wet from the solution it's as good as done. We've also tried other Gazillion bubble machines. The ones that work best are the bubble machines with batteries located at the top.
5,Bubble Machine,"This thing is AWESOME!!! I can't believe how many bubbles this tiny machine can make! You fill the little bubble bottle, tip it upside down on the little bottle holder on the machine, turn it on, and voila! Gazillion bubbles indeed! It's nice that it's so small, too. You do have to keep it on a flat surface, or you'll spill bubble fluid all over the place, but other than that, there's nothing to it! You can find bubbles at Toys'R'Us, Target, Walmart, and of course, Amazon!"
4,Amazing Bubble machine,I used this for a Town Day event. The kids were going crazy for this. It's very simple but it can be messy. The bottle leaks pretty quickly. But when it's in there it works like a charm. It's a pain to screw off the screws. Not sure why they made that part so hard. Overall a solid machine.
5,No more bubble blowing!,"Thank you Funrise for coming up with this wonderful little bubble machine. My 1 year LOVES bubbles but being 7 months pregnant and trying to blow bubbles for him all the time just about drove me batty. This gadget literally blows out gazillon bubbles. It is entertaining for both children and adults. The machine itself is not expensive but I will say the solution is a bit pricey but honestly I could care less at this point... just as long as I don't have to physically blow any bubbles myself. Since we just got it, I can't say anything about durability but it is easy to clean and I think as long as you clean it after every use to prevent the parts from getting sticky and mucked up from the solution it should be okay. Only time will tell I guess."
1,You don't get what you pay for,The bubble machine stopped working 45 days after it was opened as a Christmas present.No reason. Not the batteries.The manufacturer wanted it sent back at our cost and also wanted a proof of purchase from the box....45 days after it was opened.....like we hold on to boxes that long. They refused to accept a receipt from Amazon.They///like their toys////suck.
1,Disappointed in poor quality,"After using only a handful of times, this bubble machine stopped working. The battery compartment is not protected and if you do not empty the bubble solution after every use it leaks to the batteries and the machine breaks. Very poorly designed. Don't waste your money."
2,Great! --- if it wouldn't croak so quickly ...,This bubble machine's life is VERY limited. We had one for a few weeks and got another for a birthday present just in time as the first one croaked. Now 2 weeks later the new one is dead. I will keep returning it to get it replaced throughout the summer because the idea is fantastic and the kids LOVE it (the dogs too). I guess you get what you pay for. $12 for a couple weeks of entertainment is pretty good.
2,Gazillion bubbles - (or No Bubbles???),"My 18 month old and 4 year old love the Gazillion Bubbles bubble machine (when it works). They could play with it for hours. The Gazillion bubbles brand bubbles last much longer than other brands - but then again, cost much more. So you can use the cheapy bubbles but will have to refill more often.Problem: Toy doesn't turn on anymore. Sometimes if I turn it off and on several times, then just let it sit, it comes on after a while. Don't know why, however, becaue I have taken really good care of this bubble machine. Now it seems to not be coming on at all."
1,"Junk, wasted my money and still I'm blowing bubbles","I had high hopes for this to work, my Mom as a a wonder bubble machine that works great. I should have followed suit but this was a little cheaper. And Gazillion does have great bubbles, but the machine sucks. It never blew a single bubble out of the machine. I changed batteries twice, let it run for 30 minutes, washed it three times, tried two versions og bubbles. Not a single bubble, not one. Unless you count the ones when I was behind the machine blowing into the stupid thing to make them come out. And even then it was sad. I would not get this or any gasillion machine becuase of how bad this one was."
1,Gazillion Bubble Machine,This machine leaks badly! We had to put duct tape around all seems to keep bubble solution inside. would not recommend.
1,Did not work for us,"The machine only spit out about 4 bubbles a minute not 4,000! I am returning it asap! It was pretty disapointing with a 1 1/2 year old and two year old excited for bubbles :("
1,Waste of money,"We bought this bubble machine for our daughter's 2nd birthday and right out of the box it sucked. At first it seemed fine then the wand wheel started sticking- this is our first use. So I decided to clean it. This didn't help, if anything it made things worse. The gear that turns the wands is the problem and I quite frankly don't want to delve any further. So, I eat that 25 dollars."
1,No good,I just recieved my bubble machine. I was all excited becasue it was gonna be a gift. I put in new batteries and still nothing. I flipped twist exchanged batteries and still it didn't come on. So I packed it up and sending it back. Very disappointed!!!!
3,Ok for the money,"I had this saved in a wishlist for my toddler but found it in a store so I went ahead and purchased it. It makes tons of bubbles but the spinning wands get caught frequently and you have to bump it to get it going again. We've only used it once, so maybe next time we take it out it'll be better adjusted. It's easy to clean. So far, we've only used it with the bubble solution it comes with - it says not to use any other kind but the store we purchased it from didn't carry that brand of refill. I bought a different brand bc I don't see that it would hurt the machine. Overall, you get what you pay for."
1,it broke. Quickly. = Sad Children.,Initially it worked great. but an inquisitive 2 year old stopped the bubble wand for a brief moment and appears to have stripped the gear mechanism. Epic Fail. Sad Children. Sad end to a birthday party.
2,Amazon can actually be a ripoff!,I'm embarrassed to admit that I spent $22.00 a few weeks ago on this product. Today I see that it is priced at $12.99. I've heard of price fluctuations on Amazon but this is by far the most ridiculous. I'm a busy mom and don't always have time to comparison shop and I've always counted on Amazon to have the best price. Not this time. Very disappointed!
1,did not work,The fan motor was just too weak. It would drag around and not get any bubbles out right from the start. Can't even return it because I threw away the package. what a waste. And i needed this for a stage show.
2,Rename a dozen bubbles,"Like all other sy - it stops working after a few uses and even when it did work the bubbles were NOT a plenty. People seem content on buying again after it breaks, but it would be nice for it to have some durability. It is better than blowing the bubbles yourself"
3,fun! then boring!,"I bought this item for my son's 5th birthday. The first time we used it, it was really neat. After that it gets boring. The machine does all the work while all you do is sit and watch. Not much fun for a hyper child. There is nothing I can say bad about tthe product, it just loses its appeal quickly."
5,Poorly designed!,My son got this toy for his birthday and loved it! Unfortunately after just a few uses the battery compartment rusted and that was the end of it. Save your money until they redesign it!
1,Good Luck! No luck for us...,"We purchased this unit because they have it at my daughter's daycare, and it works great. The first unit I received did not work. The bubble wheel would not turn. The replacement unit came, and once again it was defective. I am sending both units back and I am going to try a different type of bubble machine. (As a side note - in terms of bubble fluid, the Gazillion Bubble fluid seems to work the best. There is a drastic difference when compared to some other brands.)"
2,Disappointed,"This bubble machine does have one thing going for it. It shoots tons of bubbles, just like it says. But because it blows bubbles so quickly, it runs out quickly too. I've also found it difficult to use. It is difficult to refill and difficult to move without spilling all over the place. My older son loves the thousands of bubbles but my younger son is overwhelmed by it. I wish I'd gotten something else."
4,It's all fun and games until a kid knocks it over,"We had this bubble machine for almost 2 years and never had a problem. I was careful to keep the machine away from grabby hands and cleaned it after each use. One day one of the neighbor kids knocked it down, and it was never the same. At first I had to jiggle the switch in the on position before it'll start, now it won't start at all. I don't know whether it's the impact or the bubble solution getting into the circuitry but we'll soon be taking it apart as a science experiment."
2,Great for the first few times and then useless,"I splurged on a more ""expensive"" machine for my kids and got this one. After a few uses it stopped blowing bubbles. I used their solution and it didn't work, I tried another solution and it didn't work, I took the front tray off and clean the machine and it just got worse. Now it's a great paperweight but useless as anything else. Save your money and buy something else."
2,Was great when it worked...,Bought for my two year old son for his birthday and worked for five mins. Then motor could not get the wheel to spin. Would work and then not... Felt bad cause when it did work my son was super happy.
3,a bit underwhelmed BUT...,I had a similiar (not exact) product for several years and it finally broke down. We have many children in the yar to play. We bought 2 different bubble machines and of the two this one performs the most consistantly. The two major gripes are that it is a bit spotty on the bubbles and the reservoir is VERY small needing to be refilled every 15 minutes or so. Other than that this is a good unit. VERY durable as it has survived an 18 month old two 2 year olds and a 5 year old.
5,This bubble machine kicks out THOUSANDS of bubbles. Easy to Clean!,"This puts out so many bubbles it was a little overwhelming for our son who just turned two.Seriously, the carpet was damp after 30seconds to one minute when the machine was on.The fan is strong but doesn't seem to leave a lot of sticky bubble residue in front of it or dripping down the sides.The clean up is SUPER easy! I'm so glad that it is, if I had to tear apart the machine and clean it every time we used it I wouldn't be as pleased.The only cons are that it's not very durable (I won't let my son touch it and when we're using it it goes on the top of our entertainment center so he can't grab it).And it doesn't have any way of making the fan blow on a slower speed so that there aren't quite so many bubbles at one time.Great for outdoors or parties. Make sure you have extra bubbles with you, They go fast!"
1,"Fun while they (yes, we've been through 3) lasted","Great fun to begin with, tons and tons of bubbles.Unfortunately we haven't had one live more than a week or so - we don't overfill it, we clean it with each use, we store it indoors, we replace the batteries to verify that isn't the issue, etc.They simply aren't durable."
2,"Yet, another disappointment","We bought this for our daughter 2 weeks ago and when we got home, she absolutely loved it. Following the very simple instructions on cleaning it, I didn't foresee any problems...until we'd had it for about 3 days, when it stopped working. The battery compartment was drenched with bubble solution and no matter how much I have cleaned it since, it will not work. Putting new batteries in it doesn't make a difference.I expected better, but will look elsewhere for our next bubble machine."
