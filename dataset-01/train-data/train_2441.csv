3,Lots of good information. Good overview of biscuit joining,"The book covers the most important topics relating to biscuit joining. It tells how to make a variety of biscuit joints with helpful hints on doing it correctly. It is espcially good at describing the spectrum of biscuit products and accessories available (glue bottles, self clamping biscuits, etc). A large portion of the book describes in detail the features of various biscuit joiners. This is useful if you are about to purchase a joiner."
2,Now has a complementary book!,"Hi,I have just bought Jim Stack's biscuit joiner examples and projects book and it has the examples that are missing from this book(See my review I gave Jim's book in amazon.com).I bought this book at a firesale for US $4 so I don't feel very ripped off. It was handy when I went to buy an Elu biscuit jointer that was missing all its attachments - meant I kept my $ and didn't waste them.I give the book 2 stars cause its not very informative on technique, the information is out of date and the photographs are so murky (they look like they were taken on a very dark night)."
3,A poor book,"I am amazed about the lenght of the book, most of it devoted to outline every biscuit joiner in the market. Most of these pages useful for nothing if you already own one joiner. Just a few pages on common sense ways to use the jointer. Very little to learn.My Makita instruction manual covers most of the information you can find in this book.Maybe we all expect this useful power tool to do more things than it does."
3,Biscuit Joiners Handbook,"Book was informative about different models of biscuit joiners, but somewhat out of date. The usage suggestions were good, but could have given greater explaination on cutting biscuit joints for mitered frame corners. Overall a good introduction reference manual."
3,Saggy,"I like this lunch bag pretty well. I've been using it for about a year. I am disappointed that it has recently started to sag in the back. It will not sit up straight. I have not carried anything unusual in it so I'm not sure why this is happening. Also, although it is tall and looks like you could carry a 16 or 20 oz bottle in it, you can't unless you lay it down flat. It has two compartments. One on top and one one bottom. You could probably get a six pack of 12 oz cans in to bottom."
5,I HATE Granola!!,"I hate Granola. It's that simple. I think it tastes horrible and have refused all my life to eat it. It's either gooey and nasty or dry as a desert.A couple weeks ago I saw a story on Food Network about Bear Naked Granola and really liked the people who made it. Their product looked different from most of the granola I'd tried in the past. I picked up some of theBear Naked All-Natural Granola, Banana Nutand tried it. It was love at first bite!I'm having to eat healthier after a transplant so adding this to my diet is a big help. It helps with my craving for a ""sweet"" taste without filling me up with sugar and preservatives.Regardless of what others say about it - if I like it - you probably will too."
4,Kitty Warming Pad,"One of my cats prefers to stay outside and endure the cold rather than be ""stuck"" inside. I have purchased several of these cat warmers so she has different spots to lay at and they are awesome. My cat goes to them immediately. They appear to not let off much heat but if you keep your hand on them they clearly do the job. The fleece cover is easy to remove and wash as needed. The electrical cord is sturdy and safe. The only down side is that it appears that after about a year the heat that the pad lets off is less pronounced but to be fair, I have kept them plugged in almost 24/7 for a good part of the year so I am surprised that they even still work. I would highly reccomend this product."
5,Great!,"I have been adopted by a stray cat and now he is part of our family. He loves this heating pad. It is a hard plastic and great for outdoors--as long as it is in some sort of a shelter. My husband built a little house and the heating pad is perfect. The fleece cover is very thin so I removed it and place a thicker fleece blanket over the pad (the spoiled stray likes cushion). The he loves it! I am so relieved he has a warm place to go in the winter. I tested it before placing it outside; the buttom of the pad does not get warm, only the top. The steel coil wrap over the cord is a great feature."
3,expected more,"I bought this for my cat, who tends to lay on my laptop to keep warm. I felt this would be a good alternate. Unforuntily she did not take to the kitty pad. It's true 102 degrees sounds hot, but in reality it's only luke warm. I think my overheated laptop is warmer. That may have been the reason she didn't use it. As much as I tried to get her to lay on it, she did not take to it, maybe b/c I'm using it indoors. The cord protector, I guess I didn't read it well enough, my cat does indeed chew on cords, but the metal wire almost seemed useless, she still would attempt to chew it and it made it look really ugly. With all the reviews I don't disagree this is a good product, but I would suggest for outdoor use only. My cat is 10 #'s and this size seemed slightly small as well. Would've got a larger one."
5,Heated Cat Pad,This is the 3rd heated pad I've purchased and I place mine in a lined doghouse to keep an outdoor feral cat cozy in the frigid months. Cali remains happy and healthy and that wouldn't be possible without the help of the heated pad. An excellent product and the best price and shipping is from Amazon!
2,Don't last very long,"I purchased a few of these and they're great while they last, but aren't very reliable. One broke after about 14 months, got so hot that our cats wouldn't sleep on it (it has to be pretty hot for a cat not to touch it), and I was afraid it'd burn the house down. The other just stopped heating up at all after 6 months or so. I have other heating elements that are soft, designed to fit inside a cat bed, and those are still working a few years later. I like these hard beds for outside use, for the constant stream of stray cats that show up at our property. Many cats have overwintered in our barn with these beds and they're great while they last, but are expensive for something that's going to break after one winter."
2,hard plastic may not work for all,"Well made product - 4 stars for that. 2 stars just to emphasize what some other reviewers have said - that hard plastic may not work for your cat, and you may have to return it as we did. The fleece cover is very thin and provides no cushioning. As many cat owners would do, am trying just about anything that has even a remote chance of working. Was hoping it would work for a heat-seeking indoor arthritic animal. Instead, she chose any soft surface nearby, even if it was in a cooler part of the room. The box actually suggests using it for arthritis; however, I would think that the chances of a cat using it would go down greatly if they had arthritis. So far what has worked the best is heating wire for seeds underneath a towel on top of a pillow.....and 24 hour on call petting, food, and pain meds. After all we're talking about a cat...."
5,the best on the market!,"I purchased the K&H; 3093 outdoor heated pad for some feral cats outside which is a success! I also ordered the outdoor heated soft pad which was cheaper then the K&H;, I thought it would be nice being soft and all.forget it... it is worth spending some extra bucks for the K&H; 3093!! so I ordered another one and sent the other ones back.I lost money on the shipping but it was worth it, the cats would not even use the soft ones due to them not being warm enough for outside.I see a few of them taking turns laying all night long on the K&H; 3093, if I put my hand on the pad it is so toasty warm, I could not even feel any warmth with the soft pad.I think the soft pad is good for indoors or maybe a sick animal that cant move and does not know if they are getting too hot. I highly recommend the K&H; 3093 for outdoors especially in the north where it has been freezing,they will love it and you will be happy to help them find some warmth."
1,lasted 5 months,"I purchased this item to place in the floor of a homemade tub shelter for a stray cat visiting our home.I placed the heater between the bottom of two storage tubs above 1 inch foam insulation with the electric cord exiting a hole in the corner. The entire tub was insulated all around the inner tub, sides and lid. This worked great for 5 months, keeping the internal temperature very nice inside. I am convinced it saved the stray cat's life during a very cold 2011 MN winter.However, during a weekly inspection of the house just last week, I noticed the shelter was very hot inside and the pad overheated and melted the bottoms of both the inner tub and insulation. This was a very dangerous situation as it might have killed the cat and/or started a fire on my deck had it gone unnoticed."
4,Cozy warmth for outdoor cat or small dog,"I put this warming pad with sherpa cover in a heavy cardboard box that had a handle opening on the end where the cord could be pulled out and plugged into an electrical outlet on my covered front porch. A little 6 month old feral cat curled up in it and slept soundly during some cold wet weather recently. The pad could also be used in a small dog kennel in a garage for small to medium size dogs that stay outside part of the day. The bottom of the pad did not get so hot as to be any danger to the cardboard. Overall I was very satisfied with the performance and quality of this item. It has a heavy duty safety cord that was long enough to easily reach the outlet, plus a nice removable, washable sherpa cover over the hard pad."
5,AWESOME!!!,This pad is really super for my outdoor cats. I bought two of them and have them on my back deck with a plastic tent built around them to keep the cats and pads dry!!! They stay curled up on the pads!! they love them and i feel much better seeing they are warm!!!
4,Extreme Weather Kitty Pad with Fleece Cover,I am well pleased with the kitty pad as I have had one for two years. It keeps the house warm and the cats love it.
3,"Okay, but I've got better","I bought another outdoor heating pad that is actually soft and I love it, but I can't remember the name. So when I wanted another one for my outdoor cats I bought this one. It's fine. There's nothing wrong with it, but it is a hard pad. The cats don't seem to care, so clearly it's just me, but I just like the soft, flexible pad better.That said, they're both loved by my outdoor strays. The K&H; one is sitting on an oversized chair on the porch, and I'll often go out and see 2 or 3 cats curled up on it. It has lasted all winter so far, with no problems. It's just a little bit warm, so the cats don't get too hot. So far it's caused me no problems and helps me to feel better about the outdoor strays in the winter."
5,Great!,My 20 year old cat is most appreciative. She is always on the pad keeping her old bones warmed up.
5,A must-have for outdoor cats,"I have many of these heating pads for my 6 feral cats that live outside, just kept adding more over time because the cats like them so much. I have some up on shelves and some on the ground in an area that is covered by a second floor deck so it stays mostly dry. The cats use them all winter long. The fleece covers get dirty but are easy to wash. I wish they would make the covers with a snap on the corner where the electric cord has to feed through so they'd be easier to remove without unplugging and pulling cord out. I cut the elastic on one corner and fasten it back together with a large safety pin, works okay.These last a long time, I've had them for years and only one burned out so far. Overall they seem pretty indestructible."
3,K&H 3093 Extreme Weather Kitty Pad with Fleece Cover,"Doesnt warm that much. Is okay for use inside as in a garage,but definitely not warm enough for use outside as advertised."
5,Roseanna and her two kittens sleep warm in the cold,we have a feral cat and her two kittens on the side screen porch. I made a box and put in the EW Kitty pad. Mamma and her 2 kittens love it.
1,it does'nt work!,i have 2 and they produce so much noise...even the neighbor can hear it and the cats never sat on it. Finally it is s......
3,"Works nice, but my cat was afraid of it!!","I like the heated pad but my cat was totally afraid of it, so I am returning it. I would give it 5 stars if she would use it. It gave off a little constant warmth and is supposed to warm up more when the cat lays on it, so I really do not know how warm it gets because she would not get near it. I am sorry to have to return it."
1,Outdoor Heated Kitty Pad w/Fleece Cover,"I purchased this heated pad, along with heated bowl, for 1 of 4 feral cats I care for. The others will come inside, when necessary. 1 won't. This pad is in a doghouse. It's heated enough that, with the cat's body heat and it's heat, he stays toasty warm on very cold days. When he lets me pet him, after he's been on the mat, he's warm. I recommend this purchase. Some sort of shelter is recommended, as well."
1,kitty pad,well i got this for a outside cat. Plugged it inside first and it barely got warm( more like on the bottom). took it outside and put it in a tub and it never even got warm enough to attract the cat to stay on it. So for my benefit i donated the money on this one. Not good for what it claimed for me anyway.This was put in a shed so it wasnt out side in the weather. When i got it the weather was chilly but not cold. The cats do better on their own snugglin up in the hay.
5,Great!,My Kitty who loves to be outside now has a toasty place to lay her head! I worried myself before that she would be cold even though she would NEVER come inside. Now it is great to see her using her house on the back porch! The house has a pleasant warm feel when you reach inside! She LOVES it!!!
4,Unit works wonderful,"We were replacing an older model from about 15 years ago. The new one works just as well for our outside cat, but the manufacturer made the fleece cover much smaller than the older model. The cover barely fits over the warming unit. It's great thought for keeping an outside pet warm in the extremely harsh winter nights."
3,costly and not completely satisfied,"I just dont know--for the price, i would have like something more snuggly for my cats. Adding a blanket reduces the warmth felt by kitties--but is strudy and pad is washable"
5,cats love it!,It didn't take long for my two cats to discover the comfort of this product. They sleep together and manage to both fit on the mat which I have placed inside their box.
5,Excellent service and device,"Received cat heated mat when promised. and have used it ever since, working fine and had several very cold and windy days and nights and the cat has been content to stay in her house and not beg to come inside. Have notice a slight increase in electric usage as was expected."
2,Not what it looks like on computer screen,"This kitty pad with fleece cover looked nothing like the picture that was on the computer screen. It is very small for the price and if you have a large outdoor cat then forget it. It is barely big enough for a medium sized cat. Also, the cord on it isn't very long. I would not buy another one unless I bought it in person and was able to see the item."
2,Not so Impressed,"Well, I read a few reviews and gotta admit that I was sold based on the manufacturers words rather than the folks who bought the product. Sure it warms up (and ""warm"" is really being generous) but it just doesn't stay warm, especially for outside use. My inside cat sat on it once (after I put pressure on the unit to get it to warm up) and my cat (who is super arthritic and loves heat) jumped right off. It just wasn't warm. I bought two extra pads for the ferals I take care of outside but we'll see. The cord is a good construction and nice and long. The pad cover is a good design, easy to remove/clean and soft. But, it's the actual function of the pad that sold me and it just doesn't deliver. The ferals may prefer their straw than the boxes with the pads. Will keep you posted but for the amount of money, I wouldn't buy this product again. I recommend you save your money and try something else."
4,"Kitty does,t like it","I bought one of these for each of my two cats. They are really nice, soft and warm when touched. But neither of the cats will lay on them. They won't even get on it when I put catnip on it. I guess they're just set in their ways. Maybe when it gets colder. We'll see. Will update.Update: 12/21/12. Kittys finally decided it was OK to get on the pads and they like it!"
2,Stopped working =(,"I bought this for my outdoor cat to keep her warm at night. It was placed in a cat house with minimal exposure to outside. The first night I used it, it worked very well and the cat slept on it. I plugged it in on the next cold night and it would not heat up...I may just have a defective product (as this product has many great reviews) but I was very disappointed. I am now looking at another brand heating pad for my cat."
2,Eh,"It's hard as a rock even with the included pad. The surface is uneven and jagged. My cat can't stand it. I feel sorry for the little guy because he'd rather sleep on the cold concrete than this thing. Great concept, poor execution."
5,Works great,We live in Mn and I became attached to a feral cat who took up residence in our garage when the door was stuck open for awhile. That wasn't going to be a solution over the winter. So I bought a small dog kennel and this heated kitty pad. We've had the pad for about a month & it works great so far! It's been below 0 this last week.
1,It go so hot - it melted!,We bought this for our indoor cats and they loved it for a few months. Then they stopped using it. We thought nothing of it until we went to wash the fleece pad. The entire heavy plastic base had gotten SO HOT that it distorted and curled up! No extension cords were used and it was plugged directly to a 120V 15amp outlet.
1,Only lasted three months,"This was great for 3 months. After that, when just plugged in, it would be super hot. My cat stayed away from it after that. Disappointed."
1,only lasted about 4 months,I think this is expensive since it died in under 4 months....I missed the return or exchange date. I only used it indoors for my cats.
2,Not UL approved,I sent this pad back because it was not UL approved and did not want to take a chance of fire.
2,Makes a buzzing sound,"I purchased 2 of these things. I plugged them in to test them and noticed after they started heating up that they made a low buzzing/humming sound. I called K&H, and they said this is normal and doesn't hurt anything. I sent them both back for a refund. The sound is too annoying for me (can't imagine how annoying it would be to the cats trying to sleep on them)."
4,Ta'i Chi,"I use this book frequently, and find it answers my questions. It is very helpful when the instructor is not available."
2,"Decent format and explanations, RIFE WITH ERRORS","I read this from start to finish and completed all problems. In the interest of full disclosure, I used the first edition from a library and it's possible a new and better version has been published.That said, I do not recommend this book. The author should be commended, but the editors fired. While an otherwise quite enjoyable (if basic) text, I couldn't believe how baltant the mistakes were. It's as though no one bothered to read through the final draft before sending it off.This is all too bad because the author actually did a fine job of presenting the material. If the errors were corrected, I'd recommend this as a great introduction (though a proper text is necessary for true mastery of the subject). As it is now, though, find something else."
1,Horrendous - inexcusable errors,"This book definitely has way too many errors - I pulled my hair out on a number of problems trying to make my answers work with what the book had. Finally after going over and over and OVER - I pulled out my ti89 to get it's ""opinion"" I was right. the book was wrong.PLEASE save your moneyhaving errors in the section describing i is especially unforgivable as i is a bizare concept for most people at first.just fyi - the example on page 123 when dividing (3+i)/(1-2i)the ""pre"" answer is (1+7i)/(1+4) NOT (5+7i)/(1+4)"
2,"I'm a Big fan of ""The Easy Way"" Books, but not this one.","Could be a good book, but like others have pointed out, to many mistakes, and also I feel like it didn't go into enough detail in some areas."
1,Frustrating...Don't waste your time or money,Explanations are okay but I spent lots of time checking and re-checking and still couldn't get the answers in the back of the book . Finally I decided to check reviews of this book online and make sure I wasn't a complete idiot... sure enough it wasn't me seems like plenty of others came across the same problems.
4,An enjoyable and believable romance,"Although it's true that there's not much suspense here, I don't require suspense in my romances. The interaction and growing attraction between our hero and heroine were what kept me reading. Yes, the hero is brave, noble, handsome, etc., but he was NOT bland - he was exactly the way I want most heroes to be. The heroine was independent-minded without being bossy; neither a doormat nor a rabble-rouser, which made her both admirable and believable. Definitely deserves 4 stars."
1,disappointment,twice I received the wrong brush without the hole to hang. Now they are showing it without a picture so I will not order it again.
2,Too flippity floppity for most tasks,"This brush is excellent for brushing raw egg on top of pie crust because its very very soft and flexible. It is tolerable for brushing bbq sauce on meat. Other than that, it is far too flippity floppity to do much of anything else. There is no way I could use it to grease or butter a pan, for example.On the plus side, it is nice to have such a well-made and soft brush that is reserved only for my pie crust coatings. :-)"
5,As expected,Pastry brush seems to be high quality and as described. Looking forward to using it in th near future. Shipping was fast.
2,Pretty but....,I LOVE the look of it. But it just doesn't work. I loved that bristles don't come out but it just doesn't spread well. It's kind of a pain. I'm disappointed because it's beautiful! I guess looks aren't everything!
3,brush is too small,The product is ok if you need a small baster. I need a Large baster. I gave it to my son who only makes waffles once in a while. A gal at our church has a wide paddle. Now that is what I really need.
3,Won't make me give up my bristle brush,"I purchased this hoping it might allow me to toss my standard bristle pasty and basting brush. Unfortunately although I do like it, it's not a replacement. With my bristle brush I get an even coating with just a once over, but with this I found myself needing to go over several times to get the same effect and even then it was uneven in it's distribution. I do prefer this on cleanup, a little dish soap worked through the brush and a hot water rinse was all it took. This will still have a spot in my kitchen, but it'll be in addition to not in place of."
1,Poor construction and performance,"This fell apart the first time I picked it up-- the black bristle section is only glued into the metal holder. I washed the interior section and bristles and tried using it, and it does a poor job of holding butter and spreading it evenly. Plus, the idea that any of the residual glue might be getting into the food was too much. So I threw it out after using it once."
3,"$433 list price? Is that a typo, Amazon?",You've got to be kidding. This new A5 clipper is all over the internet for about $140. I almost spit out my Dr. Pepper when I saw that. I haven't bought this yet but just had to comment on the price shown here.
1,Not a great purchase,"Bought two Tripp Lite under monitor surge protectors from Amazon and the only positive about the items was that they arrived on time undamaged. After the second day of use, the master switch on the two would not stay in the ON position when pushed in. Kept needing to do it numerous times till they finally stayed in for the protectors to stay on. Lucky for me, the wall switch controls the outlets to which these 2 are plugged into so I have to resort to that to turn them on and off. I did not want to return them for exchange or refund because I have no other monitor protectors and no one else seems to make them like in the old days. As long as I can use the light switch to control these protectors, that is the way it has to be. Hopefully no one else will have or does have the same problem as me. I do not blame Amazon for the defect - it is due to poor workmanship from Tripp."
4,Serves my needs,"This product was a perfect replacement for an old surge protector that I had that was similar. The aforementioned one lasted about 15 years and held up to adverse conditions. Very impressed with this one, however a design flaw. There is no room underneath to put papers. My other protector had enough height to put a few items underneath it. Other than that, this is a perfect replacement. It's a shame that there isn't more variety for these kind of space saving monitor on top surge protectors. My last one was Memorex Power Center/surge protector. I am happy with this as a replacement though."
4,Wonderful compilation,"I mourn the demise of Nautical Quarterly; a lovely collection of articles on power and sail boats, history and design and use. This ""best of"" could only be improved upon by a follow up volume dedicated to power boats (this volume is about sail)."
2,Waste of $$$,I bought this book because of a podcast I had heard about the author. I had my doubts about how the author is just a self promoter who is laughing all the way to the bank. The articles were boring and dated. The book is not about what is hyped.
3,You are the book shopper.,"The Best of Nautical Quarterly: Volume 1: The Lure of SailThis was not a book for me and I mean just that. For the right reader it will be a five star book. Could I have known this? Yes. To my chagrin, it would never be for me more than 'a coffee table book.' So my advice is to look into the book--it might be a really good read for you. Amazon does good for the reader with their look into the book options."
2,Not for daily use,"We purchased this item because of the knife + light function. After a few months of my husband carring it in his pocket (daily) the item separated at the rivets. Both sides still work but it has lost the ""charm"" of its intended functionality."
5,Amazing!!,"My husband picked this up so we could take good shots of our new baby. Grandparents, parents and everyone else is amazed at the studio-quality shots. Hey, the baby is gorgeous, but it takes a good camera to bring out the best! We found it especially good in flourescent lighting, where many cameras leave a lot to be desired. Also, our baby has blue eyes and the red-eye reduction feature really eliminates red eyes. A definite buy!"
1,Fuji zoom date 1000 camera,"Did not last long....second roll of film, the film would not catch because small plastic point broke off which pulls the film on the roll...I threw it away."
2,Wrong ISBN number; don't get this version,"Actually, the book is very good because it explains things via visuals rather than lots of verbal explanation. The trouble is the publisher didn't change the ISBN number. The elements 4.0 version of this book has the same ISBN number and has a blue cover, with 'updated 4.0' indicated on the top of the front cover. This states revised edition, but it's not."
5,Value limited edition!,"6 bucks from warehouse deals for a brand new, sealed anime? heck yes!You get 4 episodes and the intro song for the anime, both of which I enjoy quite a bit!If you're a fan of the show, it should be a no brainer to buy this limited edition for only $6 before Amazon jacks the price up or runs out!"
1,It is very regrettable.',"The box had dented. Because I want to ventilate grievances to amazon, a letter has not been opened yet."
1,Pediatrician said it didn't work!,Do not buy this!I had this thermometer for 8 months and never got an accurate reading. I took it to my son's pediatrician to ask if I was using it wrong and she told me that it was junk and you can't get a reading for it.I returned it shortly after that.
1,This item is TERRIBLE!,"I bought this thermometer looking for a quick and easy way to take my daughter's temperature when she was ill and it has never worked properly. Although I like how the protective sheilds are stored within the unit itself, it is hard to get them to stay on, and putting them on is a joke. Most importantly though, is the fact that the unit never gives a correct temp. I would suggest the digital ear thermometer by Braun if you you would like an ear thermometer, or just buy a cheap rectal thermometer for your little one. They are more accurate - and that's the temp. the pediatrican will ask you for anyhow. Don't waste your money on this one!"
1,worst thing ever bought!!!!!!!!,"when we bought this ear thermometer we thought it would be very helpfull, instead it has given us a pain in the neck. IT IS N-E-V-E-R ACCURATE. we tried it on me, on my wife and it doesnt seem to work. when i tried it,marked 34 c degrees which was completey false. same thing with my wife.... we tried i digital after i used the ear thermometer and it marked 37 degrees. please dont waste your money like that even if you have a lot!!!!!! i bought the braun one and it is just excellent!"
1,another bad ear thermometer,"This is the second ear thermometer I have tried with poor results (the other was a BebeSounds). This one was very difficult to actually get a reading, and when I finally did, my temperature range was from 89-92 degrees. Obviously I couldnt use it on my sick infant when I needed it. Stick with the old thermometers, either rectally or under the arm, it takes a little longer, but they are much more accurate."
2,not very accurate,"the reading was always a degree or two below a regular thermometer. maybe it is consistent enough where i could figure out the difference & add it each time, but why bother? when it comes to the health of my child i'd rather have something accurate than convenient. plus i don't want to bother with buying the probe covers, when with a regular thermomother i can just wash it with antibacterial soap. i'm going to return this one and stick to the underarm method like they use at the hospital."
1,Does not work!,"I received it as a gift after registering for it... was so excited to get it, but when I went to try it... it shows Low over and over again, no matter what I try! Very bummed... Would not suggest anybody to purchase this brand...=("
2,Rectal is easier,"We registered for and received this thermometer as a gift. We used it a couple of times when our baby was really little and we were ""just getting used to her"". Daddy would insert it into her ear while I nursed her. It seemed accurate enough. However... our pediatricians office requires that we take the temperature rectally before bring baby into the office. So, we started doing this with the $10 digital thermometer that we received in the hospital. It is so easy to take the temperature rectally once you learn how to do it. And, you have 100% assurance that you are capturing baby's real body temperature."
1,Why did they tell me to buy an EAR thermometer?,"When registering, we were told to get an ear thermometer because it was easier to get a reading on a baby. After having the baby, and having the nurses in the hospital tell me to take it rectally or under the arm, but not to use an ear thermometer, I wondered why I even registered for it?! Our pediatrician also told us she does not like ear thermometers, and we should stick to a regular digital one.Don't waste your money on a fancy thermometer, when you can get a digital regular one much cheaper and it is more accurate!"
4,Stuck in Celsius,"My wife and I really like the thermometer, but somehow we've gotten in stuck in celsius mode and can't seem to figure out how to change it back.The thermometer takes the measurements very quickly which is nice for a baby who has an ear infection. We've found the measurements to be fairly accurate."
1,No stars for this one!,"Do not waste your money purchasing (or registering for) this or any other ""accurate ear thermometer!"" They are useless--very inncaccurate and inconsistent. The old thermometer (under arm, rectal, etc.) works the best! Save your money :)"
2,Help!,"I have had pretty good success with this thermometer so far, it is a little off, but I usually add a degree or two to get a ""real"" temp. The only problem I have now is my daughter somehow switched it to Celcius and I don't know how to get it back to Fareinheit. And Safety 1st is being no help. Invest in something that has better customer support."
1,I'm with the rest of the majority,"It's true. This thing is a piece of junk. I've had it for a while now and have not used it much. My husband thought I was over-reacting when I insisted that our 21 month old felt hotter than what this digital read out was giving us. The home readout, taken 20 minutes before going to the doctor, registered 3 degrees lower than actual (home reading said 100, doctor said 103). I even took it two times in both ears to make sure I was getting a clear reading. That is distressing. The only benefit of this, of course, is that it's nice to have proof for hubby that I know what the heck I'm talking about when it comes to hyper-vigilant health care for our kids!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I received this thermometer as a shower gift and was so excited because I had always heard how easy the ear thermometers were. The very first time my daughter got sick, I used it on her and it read out a temperature of 100.5, but then I got a different reading 2 seconds later when I tried it again just to be sure. Now, it doesn't give a temperature any higher than 89 degrees! I have even tried it on myself thinking that maybe her ears were just too small, but I still had the same problems. This thermometer is a MAJOR waste of money. If you DO purchase it, save your box and your receipt."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I rented this because of all the buzz around it being the female ""American Pie"". First, I have to say that there has to be a double standard if this movie almost got an NC-17 rating compared to most of the other trash out there. Second, being neither female, 18, nor extremely wealthy, I found it hard to connect with this movie. It is a fairly standard teenage sex comedy, which is sunk by its setting in upper class New York and its snotty insider attitude. It lost me with the line, ""How do you know she's a lesbian?"" ""She went to Brearley"", which is a joke which can only be appreciated by a group of people who grew up within a 20 block radius of each other on the Upper East Side. This would have been a cute movie if it had taken more of a middle American attitude."
1,What drivel,"What an utter waste of time. Stupid women looking for nothing more than an orgasm. Wait, did I say women? Teenage girls playing as adults with adult parents acting like ignorant adolescents. No explicit sex? Are you kidding me? I didn't find a single joke or scene funny in this ridiculous excuse for a movie. The plot line and scenes just didn't make for characters that anyone should care for."
1,THIS SUCKED!,This wanna be director obviously tries every cliche in the book and tries to gain credibility by using over the hill non talents like Ryan Oneal. Plain and simple....just pass this one up.
1,Total waste of time and money.,"This must be one of the most stupid movies ever made. A total waste of time and money. Lame story, poor acting, terrible dialog . . . I don't understand why someone like Mia Farrow would agree to be in such a piece of cinematic crap!"
1,Do not buy this product,"I've spent several frustrating days trying to get this product to work. I'm a very experienced PC programmer/user. Repeatedly installed the software, experienced problems with cryptic error messages, uninstalled it and tried again. Searched their website for updated drivers (which appear to be dated). Called Hauppauge ""tech support"" and was given a very cold shoulder...not too interested in helping...got no satisfaction. Getting an RMA and sending this crap back for a refund. DO NOT BUY!"
1,Rotten customer support,"The included software is functional, but it is clunky. My big gripe is with their nickel-and-diming customer support -- if you lose your original install disk, Hauppauge makes you buy a replacement. Apparently being in possession of the necessary hardware is not proof enough that you bought it."
2,wintv-pvr,"I purchased this over a month ago, but was not able to set it up yet. I went to set it up and was missing the install CD. Went to the website and was able to download the driver, but not the software. The website says have to purchase the CD and that cost an extra $9.95. Not to impressed with the purchase and will think again before buying anything else."
2,Hard to recommend this buggy product,"I owned a Win-TV USB for several years and it worked very well and was stable. This seemed like a natural step up for recording capability and USB2 speed. When it works, it works well. However the ""power on"" light almost never works whether the power is on or not. More annoyingly, the product is almost never recognized on Windows XP start up. If you try to turn it on, you get a ""board not installed"" type error. Then you have to either unplug the power or the usb cable to get Windows to recognize it - everytime you want to use it. Other reviews I have read make the same comments. For this kind of money, you should get ""Plug and Play"", not ""unplug and plug-in to play"". Wish I bought ATI."
1,Win TV,WORTHLESS!!! Works with cable and older model satilite recievers. Do not through away your money on this garbage piece of equipment. I wish that I could give in a negative star rating!!!
1,You just won yourself a customer.,"I've been mulling over the best tuner card for weeks now and for the longest time I had settled on the Winfast TV USB II card. The only thing that kept me from buying was that I was having trouble finding 3rd party menuing software that was compatible. Slowly, it dawned on me, no such 3rd party software exists. Despite the superior quality of the winfast device, I'm probably going to have to settle for the more expensive, buggier, less functional WinTV.Bleh."
4,An Excellent Novel!,"Early in this novel an away team from the Enterprise enters the atmosphere of an alien planet in a shuttlecraft, and from there events seem to spin out of control, as the Enterprise crew is accused of possible negligence in the loss of thousands of lives. Most of this book involves the Enterprise crew trying to find out the details of what happened and vindicate themselves. The Vulcans still largely believe that Terrans should not be exploring interstellar space as they view earth as not ready for the challenges it presents. The plot has it's complications as beings able to travel from the future to the past provide many twists. I can say here that I did enjoy this novel, although it was not one of my favorite Star Trek adventures. This work by Paul Ruditis is the novelization of the final episode for season one and the first episode of season two for Star Trek: Enterprise, overall well worth reading for any Star Trek fan, and others who like science fiction."
3,Enterprise: Shockwave,"There are two reasons to read the novelization of a filmed work. First, it often includes scenes that were edited from the original for reasons of length. Second, it often presents the internal dialogue of characters. Both reasons add depth and explanation to the film work. This novelization does neither of these things. It presents in almost exact detail the two-part film version. It is filled out with flaskbacks to earlier shows in season 1, presumably by way of explanation for those who would buy the book without having seen the shows. In short, save your money and download the film version off the internet. There is nothing new here."
2,Not as enchanting as it is plodding,"Very drawn out. The characters were not well developed, and the sex scenes were boring and formulatic. A medieval setting and long dresses does not a romance make."
5,Love,"Love Lisa Jackson books. Although this one was a little different, I still love it. Look forward to reading her other historical novels"
4,Lisa Jackson did a great job,I thought this was a very good book. I didn't want to put it down. The book had good characters and a good plot.
5,R. Stevie Moore - Musical Genius !!!,"This cd is amazing! R. Stevie Moore is one of the most amazing musicians I have ever listened to. His lyrics are very clever as well, not the putrid sameness of most top 40 pop. This cd has slow as well as more up beat songs. Stevie moves well from one to the other. I have listened to the Beatles WhiteAlbum as well as Pet Sounds by the Beach Boys. As much acclaim as those albums get, I still think this album is more creative and musically pleasing.Long live R. Stevie Moore! There hasn't been a musical genius like this sinceMozart!"
5,Good!,"Took a little longer than expected to get to me, but not that much longer. It was a good quality product."
1,The worst book I Have ever read on this subject,"Mr. West writes about the Vatican not about the Roman Catholic Church. If he had not been a priest i would have understand some of his descriptions about Catholic Church. Since he has enouph information on the subject it seems he wants to ""reprove"" some of the Church's institutions by providing information he knows not beeing totaly correct. Saying half a true it is the better way to say a lie Maria Santos"
1,dissatisfied customer,This was not a Peter Pan costume -- it was a Robin hood costume. Not quite what I ordered. What a frigging con !
4,Good fan. The picture on amazon.com is misleading,"I bought this fan to replace the Antec ""ball baring"" fan, which is very noisy (see related review). This fan is smooth and much quieter. However the picture of this fan on amazon.com is wrong. The picture shows that this fan has a power pin and another pin, which goes to the ""system fan"" plug on the motherboard (so you can monitor the fan speed if your bios support this feature. The Antec ball baring fan has this pin). But this fan actually has only the power pin. Although I will not return this fan, I want to point out that if you want to monitor the fan speed, this fan will not work."
1,fan,Was not the fan that was shown in the picture or discription. didnt like it so had to send it back
3,The fan is a spare,This fan is a spare that is very capable to replace a normal one. It is very unique that it can replace a cpu cooler fan.
1,Not what I expected,"I typed in a specific part # and purchased what I thought was the same fan motor. The fan motor that I received was not the same part that I thought I was buying and was not even the same size. The connectors were completely different. Needless to say it did not work for my application. This may be my fault. I'm not sure, but I will not be ordering any more ""parts"" from this site. The End"
3,Great Live Album RUINED by Some Moron Somewhere,"As the reviewer below mentions, this is some fine live stuff from one of the best line-ups of one of the best bands ever. What's not to like? Well, some IDIOT at BBC (or whoever produced this) added an applause track that is a LOOP about 4 seconds long repeated over and over, with the same whistle coming along every four seconds. Did they think we wouldn't notice? It turns every segue into an excruciating exercise in frustration.But: buy it for some good versions of Family standards, especially a powerful ""Sat'd'y Barfly"" and a few others from the peerless ""Fearless"" album."
3,Only for BGV,"These are besutiful lady , ocean...,that'a all. It's good for having a coffee , taking a brake. I think ""Thisn is National Geographic Video for me."
4,Bones abound!,"The Smithsonian's high praise on the cover was earned, however I was a little disappointed. It may be because it is the first book about paleontology that I have read since I was a kid, when everything was new and exciting. Or because the subject isn't one of my top interests these days. But I was curious about the topic, having read the Smithsonian magazine coverage on the dinosaur to bird continuum. It was great fun to join in the adventure as the author travelled around gathering bones and experiences on digs at significant sites! I learned a lot about the process of excavation and preserving these artifacts and treasures. And I did not realize that funding was so scarce! Given the dedication to uncovering the natural history of life on the planet as we know it, the story is all the more compelling. It's very good reading."
4,The Carole Bayer Sager Songbook,"Entitled ""The Carole Bayer Sager Songbook"" this is a fantastic promo release (not for sale but available through some online dealers) of songs by Carole Bayer Sager from the early seventies to 1996. It features songs by artists like Melissa Manchester, Peter Allen, Christopher Cross (the Oscar-winning ""Arthur's Theme""), Patti La Belle, Bob Dylan, Michael Jackson, Diana Ross, James Ingram and many more. There are several demos and unreleased tracks."
5,"Buffy is awesome, and so is this poster.","Buffy is awesome, and so is this poster. She looks fine as hell. I love this poster just so much."
2,"Hgh level intro, poor examples","While the book provided a high level overview of client side scripting, it failed to provide adequate examples. The Appendix provides an example of an online dating service, but the code is incomplete and poorly documented. Also, I would have liked more VB Script reference"
2,Buy something else - I threw mine away,"I found this book very annoying and nearly useless. It over-viewed most every aspect of ASP, however it never explained anything in detail. Not one solid example exists in this book. I spent a week reading and it's obvious that the book uses a lot of technical jargon to make the authors sound knowledgeable. It's a poor attempt at making a quick buck by hopping on the 'new craze' bandwagon, knowing people will buy it.However, I was pleased with the layout and detailed explanations provided in some other books on the same subject."
4,Useful Introduction,"This book provides a useful introduction to ASP when read in conjuction with Microsofts owninformation . It provides particular usefulinformation on ADO. This book is probably more useful as an introduction. It also provides a interesting case study in the appendix. It would have been nice if some smaller case studies were given earlier on in the main text. I would add that at the time of reading, there were no other books on the subject. In short - recommended"
1,Working With Active Server Pages fails to achieve goals.,"Working With Active Server Pages appears to have been published without going through any editing stages. The book is very poorly focused, with dozens of forward references and a non-intuitive approach.A tough subject like this is better served by building a sequence of useful examples, starting small and adding complexity and functionality as the chapters progress. This book comes at you from all angles, and after a complete reading you are still not sure where to begin.Also annoying is the author's reliance on their web site for all code samples. This is a nice way to provide code to readers, but the samples should also be included in the text for those of us reading on an airplane .....Marc Fairort"
1,Don't Waste Your Time...,"Maybe if you have been programming in c++ for twenty years you would have an easier time understanding why they go into such lengths to talk about OOP. Filled with unclear examples, trivial personal asides and a egotistical writing style that drove me nuts. I kept hearing The Church Lady saying ""Well, we like ourselves, don't we..."". I agree one-hundred percent with everything that the other reviewers giving a score of 1 star have said. This book is a waste of time!"
1,Disciples of Microsoft,"The authors have either been completely brainwashed by Microsoft, or have been paid a substantial amount of money by Microsoft to give rave review to their book. The authors preach how ASP will change the entire world... absolutely untrue. This book takes 6 chapters before you actually start coding ASP. A 6 chapter introduction is FAR too long! It's also incredible to see an entire chapter devoted to bad-mouthing PERL. This book assumes that UNIX does not exist.. and everyone in the world has been assimilated by Microsoft. You're better off buying another book!"
3,"A very good reference, lacks examples on text manipulation.","Question:ASP doesn't seem to like the following piece of code:var_1 = request(""fieldname"") start loop if (someobject.Line = var_1) then do something end if end loopBasically, it seems that the if statement doesn't work when a variable is assigned to another like: var_1 = Request(""field"")When I write var_1 = 5 The statement works. I find it very strange, any suggestions ? thanks"
1,Don't waste your time with this book,Database coverage is confusing at best and the coverage of the rest of the book is severely lacking. Look elsewhere for your asp information
1,Does this question go anywhere? Neither does this book...,"The authors are really excited about ASP. They think ASP will change your life. ASP is very exciting. Your life will never be the same because of ASP. With ASP, everything changs in your life. ASP. ASP. ASP.That's about the first 500 pages.How do you actually implement ASP? Well, you won't find out in this book. Buy Professional ASP by Wrox instead. It will make your life a lot easier."
2,Was highly recommended by Microsoft employees,"This book was the first of its kind on the market when I began developing with ASPs. It was highly recommended by Microsoft support personnel (although not a MSPress book). After buying it and reading it, I was frustrated because I still had no handle on the technology. It is a terrible reference book for developers and mediocre for those high-level programmers interested in the technology"
2,Has quite a few errors and very little detail on using ADO,"Does not give very much detailed information about using ADO with ASP. It has two pages dedicated to adding, inserting, updating and deleting records. It does give you example code but I found found several erros myself. Take this book with a grain of salt"
2,Not for the beginner. Not well organized,"I got this book for about 1/2 price. Now I know why. I was a beginner to ASP when I got the book and this was not the book for me. Perhaps re-reading it after learning from another source, I might find it more useful."
2,Pass!,"At the time it was published, it was recommended by MS personnel 'cause it was the ONLY book on the market. Because it was written based on the beta version of ASP (Denali) and seemingly rushed to market to be ""the first out the door"", it's full of holes, errors, and typos. There are better alternatives on the market (I personally recommend Sams.net's ""Active Web Database Publishing in 21 Days"" because it provides insights into client and server scripting as well as data issues)."
1,The book is a complete failure. BUY IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!,"While this book covers some useful topics (for instance Client/Server Model), it fails to tell you how you can actually sit down in front of a computer and just get to the programming part. I went through looking for a simple example of a form that takes the data from a browser and puts it into an Access database, but I just could not find it. The vocabulary used in this book will have you turn to your Dictionary at least once every page that you read."
2,"not enough details, not clear, not well organized","This book was the first of its kind when ASP first comes out. Other than that, there is really little in it that would help a developer. things are not really well explained either.too much fluff"
2,It must be broken.,"Already in command of HTML and VBscripting, I tried to use this book as an ASP tutorial. Didn't work. After figuring alot out on my own and with examples on the web, I tried using this book as a reference book. Didn't work. I don't know where the authors expect you to go with this book. Sometimes it goes in to too much detail and other times I am left guessing. I use it as a way to prop up my monitor; works well."
5,Great product!!!,I've purchased this product before and I've tried other soaps to clean my beauty blender and this is the only product that will get my blender squeaky clean. Will continue to purchase.
4,Great songs for a low price.,"Ranging from selections of La Traviata, Il Trovatore and other popular Italian operas, this is a great cd for under four bucks. The singers may not be well recognized, but they do possess powerful voices."
5,Italian Opera,Fabulous collection! Has many of those beautiful songs from the movies we love and could not find!
4,Let me hear some of that rock and roll music.,"This is a good compilation of Beach Boys songs. But there are a few curious choices made in song selection. Why is the minor b-side ""409"" included when there are many bigger hits that were left off? Don't get me wrong, I love ""409"", but it's not a ""greatest hit"". But the main fault here is the inclusion of two mediocre new recordings at the end of the CD. Still, it's easy to find a cheap used copy of this, so it's worth getting."
3,A very gentle cozy,"Septuagenarian Sister Mary Helen is sent to retire and do research at the Mount St. Francis College for women. Her expected peace is disturbed when an unpopular professor is murdered during an earthquake. She assists the bemused police department in solving the crime and meanwhile helps a confused young police officer sort out the moral issues of her personal life.The book is gentle and prim almost to the point of doddering, despite the fact that Sister Mary Helen is a Very Modern Nun. The violence happens neatly offscreen and mysteries are solved without much fuss. Well-written for what it is and could be just the right thing if you're in the mood."
3,Dead Bodies Keep Turning Up....,"At first, this book was pretty slow going, I could be impatient, but Mary Helen seemed to be like Angela Lansbury from Murder She Wrote...where ever she shows up there is trouble and at least a dead body or two.There were actually two stories going at once. The love life of the female detective assigned to the case who is living in sin with her boyfriend, which I didn't care for those parts, and the actual murder mystery.I found the book to be funny at times imagining this elderly nun and her antics. I chuckled here and there at some of her personal remarks about herself, but the storyline seemed forced and some events seemed to be thrown in at opportune times rather than worked into the story.All and all it is a cute story for someone who is looking to kick back with a quick read."
3,Sister Mary Helen is Good Too!,This is an enjoyable book. The only downside is it's a very small paperback with very small fonts.
5,Simply the best,Simply the best textbook on software engineering. Concise content and extensive coverage of most conventional SE topics. For students and practicioners who are interested in learning more than drawing simplistic diagrams.
5,Gary Jenning's NonFiction Book,"This was the first nonfiction book I had read. He was an excellent wordsmith and very wide travelled story teller. His other stories about the Aztecs, Marco Polo and others were exciting reads."
5,Wish I'd had this when I started!,"This book was a great read, I really wish I'd had it when I started studying Martial Arts. The book gave a good overview of some of the cultural stigmas surrounding MA as well as what to look for in a school. I'd recommend Mr. Wedlake's books to anyone. He has a lot of information to share that will make you life easier and help make your studies more effective."
5,Based on the Krupp family,"First came on this movie while reading ""The Arms of Krupp"" by William Manchester ISBN: 0736607161 the paragraph that mentions this film is:""Yet war ministers abroad were still very much aware of the family. So were the critics, as George Bernard Shaw demonstrated brilliantly in December 1905 when his ""Major Barbra"", a thinly veiled satire largely based on the Krupps, opened in London. In the play Barbara is substituted for Bertha, the head munitions family is named Sir Andrew Undershoot, and Bertha-Barbara is given a pacifist brother called Stephen.""The movie its self has some ""Major"" actors as Windy Hiller, Rex Harrison, and Robert Morley."
1,Cateye = bad,"Couple of things happened. First one of the rails on the computer broke so the unit would not stay on the handlebar attachment. Contacted Cateye support by email numerous times. NO RESPONSE. So I figured I would superglue it and it seemed to work OK for now. Then the screen went blank. Bought brand new batteries, still blank. Attempted to do a full reset, still blank. Contacted Cateye support. NO RESPONSE. They don't seem to care. Lost me as a customer and anyone else that will listen."
3,basic TV spin off book,"Basic storyline, reasonable for early readers. I bought this book because my son is a huge fan of the Backyardigans, not for it's literary merits."
5,Wonderfully insightful!,"I am so grateful this book was written. Drs. John Bastyr and Bill Mitchell are both icons in the field of naturopathic medicine, and now that they are both gone I feel so lucky to have some insights into the methodologies of their practice. This book is out of print so get it while you can. Note as others have said that it is not an introductory text or even any sort of resource text, but may be useful to a practitioner or advanced student of naturopathy."
1,Practically Worthless,"About what I would expect from one of the founders of Bastyr Naturopathy College (Bill Mitchell). This book is chock full of erroneous hype, but very little substance. The herb monographs lack any practical information and are based on heresay, at best. While the cover looks quite impressive, one peek inside reveals a rather amaturish job. Anybody who pays almost seventy dollars for this is sure to be dissapointed!Much better choices on the subject are ""Herbal Medicine"" by Weiss and Fintelmann or Schulz, et al. ""Rational Phytotherapy"""
1,Donald J Pliner women's peny loafer,"I ordered this shoes and instantly returned them they hurt my feet so bad, I could not even stand in them. They are very narrow so for people who have a slighter wide foot these will not work."
3,It is okay...,"but I didn't find it all that useful. More than half of the activities are not feasible. Also, there needs to be some preparation or the outcome of the devotional will be less than what is desired."
2,Bachmann foot bridge,"Looks very realistic but rather flimsy in construction. It is meant to straddle two rail lines, but won't unless they are close together."
5,Happy Baby Food Grinder Redux,"Thirty years ago I got this grinder to introduce my children to solid food. It was fantastic! A little of what we were eating ourselves through the grinder, maybe mixed with a little milk to make it softer, and the baby had something new to eat. I googled the name Happy Baby Food Grinder so I could buy it for my first grandchild expected very soon. I hope it lives up to my experience because I used it through two children despite its being made mainly of plastic. I can't begin to estimate how much I saved by not buying baby foods. To quote an old commercial, ""Try it. You'll like it."""
1,Piece of Junk,"The food grate is plastic, not metal as the picture shows it to be. Couldn't even make applesauce with it. Piece of junk. The only thing I could get through the mill was a banana, and I can mash that with a fork. I recommend trying a higher end food mill."
3,Great for small quantities!,"I bought this food mill to make baby food for my infant sons. I found that using a stick blender is much easier and quicker for making large quantities to freeze. However, meats don't work with a blender and I have had to use this mill. It works great and gets the meats as fine as possible, but it is so slow! I try to make meat for a month at a time (a couple of pounds) and it takes me more than half an hour just to get it through the mill (after all of my cooking and prep). By the end of this time my arms and shoulders are sore. I also then have to take the meat and mix it with water with the blender. Tonight I tried to avoid the sore shoulder by hooking up my cordless drill to where the crank goes and it went much better! So, this is a great product to use in moderation, but not for large quantities."
1,waste of money,"neat concept, but i could have (and did) a much better job with a fork and a bowl...all this does is make a royal mess. don't waste your money."
2,Flimsy and limited utility,"I had high hopes for this food mill and researched it carefully before purchasing. However, it has far under performed relative to expectations. The mill is chintzy (predominantly plastic with a small, dull stainless steel bar that passes for the blade). The space where you would put the food is tiny (about 1/4 cup), it's difficult to attach the grinding apparatus to the bowl, it tips over easily and overall is messy. I can only use it to grind very soft items for my baby. I am very disappointed."
1,diappointed,"We recently bought this baby food mill to use to grind food for our grandchild, but am very disappointed in how it functions. It does not push up easily in the tube portion and I found it difficult to put grinding head in the top. When our son was an infant 20+ years ago we had a grinder that looked like this one, but functioned without difficulty. AB"
3,Kidco F700 Baby Food Grinder,The grinding blade is plastic and it takes a lot of effort to get it to cut the meat. Many years ago I had a baby food grinder for my children and the blade was metal and it worked so much better. The plastic blade is fine for soft foods such as fruits and vegetables. I use it because I've had oral cancer and have trouble swallowing. This product is handy for when I need to grind my food at a restaurant because it works manually.
1,"Wow! Maurice Andre plays Haydn & Hummel. Oh wait, it's not","I own this CD and it clearly states that Tarr is playing the Haydn and the Hummel. This is definitely not Edward Tarr's best album. This is a horrible recording of the hummel if you ask me. My advice is to find an actual Maurice Andre Recording on the EMI label. I have one that is recorded with Berlin and Karajan. This is my favorite Hummel recording. Buy it, not this."
2,"this is not maurice, not a definitive recording","this recording is definitely NOT maurice andre recording. I have studied maurices playing for many years and i have compared the playing in this CD with other Recordings of Maurice playing the Haydn and Hummel. Theres no way anyone who has heard both could mistake this trumpet player for Maurice. THe playing is good,and it is a good supplement to you collection of recordings of these popular trumpet concertos, but it is not a staple of any collection as Maurice Andre IS. Articulation and tone are simply not on the same level as Maurice and the tone is incompatible with maurices."
2,"Another movie spoiled by ""The Dead End Kids""","What did audiences see in these kids? They are painful to watch. Poor Bogie, I wouldn't be surprised if being forced to share the screen with this kind of lackluster talent was one of the reasons actors became free agents. Aside from the cringe-inducing ""Kids"" it's a serviceable gangster yarn. I'm honestly shocked it has attained ""classic status"" I also didn't like the ending, and here's why: It very well could have been poignant, a tough-guy sacrificing his dignity for the good of the youth, but it is done so heavy-handedly as to lose all of its ""punch."" Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of classic films, if I weren't I wouldn't have bothered to rent this. Rent ""The Big Combo"" instead. In my opinion it is the best gangster film to come out of this era that I have seen so far. Also, Bogie gives a much better performance as a gangster in ""High Sierra"" and neither one includes ""The Dead End Kids."""
5,Angels with dirty faces,"Five out of five stars.One of my favorite James Cagney films of all time. Great price, fast delivery. This is action packed."
5,The Cagney You'll Remember,"Of all the Cagney films I've seen, and I've seen a lot of them, this is the way that I always remember him. He's tough talking, swaggering, with the hint of a good guy that never got a break and was destined for a life of crime. Cagney is amazing in this role, and you'll recognize so many of the mannerisms and speech patterns that became his trademark and part of his legend. Pat O'Brien also makes a good impression in his role as Father Connelly, and this type of role is what he is well remembered for, too. It's a basic story of two friends, and one goes down the right road, while the other goes down the wrong road. The movie is fast, full of memorable moments, and the last scenes will stay with you for a long time. This is one of those ""they don't make them like that anymore"" movies, and it's a must-see for anyone who likes Cagney, gangster films, old films, or simply good movies."
5,The Masterpiece of Social and Crime Drama,"The best movie to Worldwide in 1938 and one of the best of all time. Even better than 1938 classic films: The Lady Vanishes (best direction of 1938, New York Critics) The Grand Illusion, Quai des Brumes, You Can't Take It with You (Oscar Best direction of 1938) and many others , and The Godfather and Goodfellas of course,(although I really like these and are favorite of mine). Watch it and enjoy the beauty and depth of this masterpiece."
3,Preaching Sinks It,"If watched with an unsentimental eye, this is a preachy and somewhat creaky crime flick. Cagney is great as usual as the tough as nails, street-smart Rocky. Bogart and Sheridan give good support, but are underutilized. What ultimately sinks this film, though, is O'Brien's sermonizing and the hammy performances of the Dead End Kids. Maybe this was timely in 1938, but it simply doesn't stand the test of time. For Cagney diehards only."
3,SENTIMENTAL GANGSTER CLASSIC,"Off-screen pals James Cagney and Pat O'Brien team up for the sixth time in ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES (1938). Nominated for three Oscars"", this classic stars Cagney as a kid from New York's Hell's Kitchen whose underworld rise makes him a hero to a gang of slum punks. O'Brien is the boyhood pal-turned-priest who vows to end Rocky's influence.Extras: a 1938 newsreel, ""Where the Stars Begin"" musical short and ""Porky and Daffy"" cartoon. Also, the new featurette ""Whaddya Hear? Whaddya Say?"" The interesting commentary's by Dana Polan and there's a terrific audio bonus of the original radio broadcast starring Cagney and O'Brien."
4,Cagney,"""Whadda ya hear! Whadda ya say!"", Bogey and Cagney in the same flick? A must have for the serious collector, I say!"
5,CAGNEY AND BOGEY TOGETHER,Jimmy and bogey rule the screen in this film. Its about the kids who love a priest and look up to a bootlegger Rockey sullivan. Fourstars the only thing better is White heat and yankee doddle dandy
5,The All-Time Best Gangster Movie,"The fabulous James Cagney was never better, as his portrayal of Rocky Sullivan has great depth. Even though this film has been emulated time and time again, the characters are deeper than the cliches they have become. Surprisingly, the films holds up well, as the problem with youths worshipping the criminal element is just as prevalent today as it was when the film was made. Strong performances, gripping drama and humor make this a perfectly-paced, emotional blockbuster. In my opinion, Cagney's final scene is his finest on film (and you don't even see him for half of it!) He is incredible. Do yourself a favor and see Cagney at his best, and enjoy the greatest gangster movie of them all."
5,The Loudest Silence,"Okay. Here's all I needed to know: this is the second collaboration between Autechre and the Hafler Trio. So I bought it. Two discs, one piece is about 35 minutes and the other is 49 minutes. There are long stretches of silence in this disc, as well as rumbling and harsh tones. Very minimalist. I have no idea how they worked on these other than they supposedly ""remixed"" each other's tracks. The packaging is beautiful, very sparse and ornate at the same time. I paid $30.00 for this, but since I'm a rabid Autechre fan (and I really like H3) I would have easily paid twice that."
2,Disappointing,"We've been using whole grain pastas almmost exclusively for about 2 years and have had more mediocre pastas than good. Unfortunately, the texture of this pasta when cooked just doesn't come up to par with the Kroger store brand or others that are pretty good."
5,love it !,"i remember seeing this vid bootleg and its even better on dvd. arrived before time.everything good. legit video and extras, thanks !"
1,Waste of Money,"I hesitated to buy this book because it was $28 but I thought it would be worth it. I was wrong! What a waste of money, I wouldn't pay $5 for it!"
2,"Geothermal Energy: Great Idea, Badly Executed","The CD Geothermal Energy is an enormous collection of virtually useless data compiled by the federal government and plopped into a homemade CD with a bad search engine. If you want to know who bid on federal geothermal projects in 1993, this is for you. On the up side, the CD does provide Internet links to some useful sources. I hope this pathetic project inspires somebody to compile something useful on this technology so vital to our energy needs."
5,Excellent!,"As a Yoga Instructor that I am, this book helps me talk about the exact muscles being stretched/strenghtened.The ""Obstacles and Notes"" are a great addition."
5,A profound treatise on health,"This very insightful book gives both general Ayurvedic guidelines for a healthy, balanced lifestyle for everyone to follow, as well as recommendations based on your specific Prakriti or mind-body type that you will be able to determine by reading the book. This knowledge of your Prakriti, then, will shed light on many aspects of yourself: now you will be able to gain a clear understanding of your habits and reactions, see them in a new light and make adjustments in your lifestyle leading to health,peace and harmony. Thank you Dr. Svoboda!"
3,"Not Up To Snuff, Pass this one by!","As an avid documentary freak since the age of sixteen, some thirty odd years now this production is sorely lacking! Too little running time and too much subject matter equal less than adequate information and detail on the subject matter. This video is just a basic overview of the subject matter with little depth or enough detail to maintain a positive interest in continued viewing. Not worth 25 Cents!Monuments to Freedom - The Presidential Memorials (History Channel) (A&E; DVD Archives)"
5,A Comprehensive Overview,"Leavitt is wonderful historian and although the majority of her early work centered on women's health throughout US history, in ""Sickness and Health in America"" she once again proves her ability to ferret out wonderful historians who write well and on pertinent issues. Encompassing classic works like the work on the Tuskagee Syphilis experiment and early work on attitudes toward persons living with HIV/AIDS, Leavitt should be applauded once again for her tireless efforts toward public health history."
4,Hunter 2 pack very cool,"None of the halo toys are built for hard play, they are collectables, but they are still fun for the kid."
5,Halo 2 Series 6 Hunter Pack,The Hunter pack arrived on time in perfect condition and was just what my son wanted.
4,full of rare photographs,"Anyone interested in the history of Country Music will learn much from this book. The text addresses the music business, the musical background of the genre, and the ""founding fathers and mothers."" Multiple photos on each page, going back to the early 20th century. 256 pages."
2,Not recommended,"Ernst's critique of Europe and America leaves little room for actual writing about Islam. He really only covers three aspects of Islam itself, and these three only in brief: ""The Sacred Sources of Islam,"" Islamic Ethics, and Sufiism. Ernst neglects most of Islam (which is certainly more the Qur'an, law, and mysticism); he attaches much more weight to colonialism, to which he devotes two chapters and numerous tangents in the other three. All told, Ernst fails both to adequately criticize the West and to instruct about Islam, because 210 pages is not enough room for both. Most arguments lacked sufficient evidence and over-simplified the subject. There are better introductions to Islam, and better critiques of Western tunnel-vision."
5,Not TY,"The kitty I recieved was not a Ty kitty. However, she was very pretty and well constructed, so I didn't care."
4,Hirokin:The last Samurai,the movie l is very good and recomment to other people to watch.there is good end of a story and l like it
1,Wowwwww,Holy crap this this is a bad movie. 3 minutes in and I'm not sure if I want to watch anymore. I'm waiting for the Mystery science theater 3000 crew to chime in here any minute.I sthere anything else available besides 1 Star?
1,Really Bad,"With a cast of 20 or 30 and not one original line or idea in the whole movie. Really? the last samurai? He's not even Japanese and not even on Earth, not to mention the sword play was pathetic. I have to wonder how this was ever released in it's current form. The actors should have pooled their money, bought the film and burned it."
1,Worst movie ever,"Outdated lines, poor themes, bad acting - this movie has it all. I truly don't understand why ""quality"" actors would submit to being in a loser like this."
2,ugh,"Seem like a interesting show to watch. Even if it was more going B rate movie. The story just went bad as far as the driven character. The story had promised but it missed its mark in the end. There was lots of dots that really didnt connect well in the story. It was more like ok hero, skip skip, people follow skip skip, and over. It was missing a lot of background and frankly wish that if people are going to do a movie at least put effort in building the character and story. Too mundane and boring. I spent most of the time messing with my cat.. petting him and having him attack my hand under a blanket. you know the pick o boo. something is moving in the blanket and get a kick of watching the curious cat try to attack this unknown object. That should tell you how interesting the movies was to me."
2,A mess,"I picked this up for a weekend afternoon (it was a nasty day) viewing because the cover and title looked OK. What you have is Gladiator meets Prince of Persia meets Kung Fu (the TV series) which, given the indie budget, results in a muddled mess where very little makes sense to the viewer and, if my guess is correct, to the actors. Gave it two stars because I did sit through the whole thing, though if I had been interrupted I probably would have forgot about it completely."
2,Those who dig Yu-gi,This set is to be ignored. Anyone who wants to own the full 1st season of Yu-gi-oh needs only to buy the Season 1 set. It sells for almost $90.00 at most retailers but is the only good choice for owning the series. This Volume 11-13 set shouldn't even be purchased by those who have all of the other single volumes up to this one. The best way to go would be to sell the single volumes and purchase the all-inclusive season 1 box. Mine came with a metal collectors tin. Happy hunting.
5,Sweet!!!!!!!!!!,"This was a great set because it is athe final duels in the ""Duliest Kingdom Tournment"" in Yu-Gi-Oh!. For any Yu-Gi-Oh! fan they love to see Yugi and Joey lose there cool and still the outcome is Yugi Joey win there matchs. Its also a good dvd because it shows two friends (Yugi & Joey)duel for everything."
1,Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Collection 1995-1999,"When i first heard about it, I was excited and could not wait to get my hands on it. however, it did not live up to my expectations. It's more like a documentary about a model's life and all other HOO HAH!!if you are a guy and thinking about getting it, forget it.if you are a girl and always wanted to be a model, I guess it would be of some use.Trust me, don't learn the hard way......."
4,WOW a 16 year old author!,I purchased this book when I saw the author interviewed on our local news. The characters are fairly well developed. I think it is fabulous that a young person wrote this book. I found the typographical errors to be distracting. I would suggest proofreading it again.
4,One Good Conspiracy Book,"This is one good conspiracy book. I'm a student of politics and government, so this was right up my alley. This work of fiction blends with facts to the joy and amusement of the reader. I enjoyed watching Pacheco with Ali, I liked listening to him call fights on NBC and now I love to read his novels. Cheers to Ferdi!"
2,Cellet Noble Case for 8125,"This is a nice black leather case, but is a very tight fit for the Cingular/HTC 8125, especially when removing.Don't let an important call come in, as one can miss it or accidently press ignore, if placing the phone in the case one can even press redial, or turn it on if it is off.I have had it for a few weeks and suggest cutting a piece of wood a little bigger than the phone and place it in the phone for a few days to stretch the case.This item is well for a carpenter or wood working person."
4,Good Buy,I am completely satisfied with this product. It serves my purpose and the oder was also received in a timely fashion.
4,Very sweet story,"This book is a continuation of the family story started in Miriam's Journal and continued in Dora's Diary. These are sweet, simple stories about the Amish people. The characters are real, and they face hardship and joy through their faith in God. These books are not intellectual, deep-thinkers. They are sweet stories, that make you long for a simple life with family, friends, and God. They make you feel better for having read them. Definitely start off with Miriam's Journal series."
3,They're Trying At Least,"It managed to be touching in some places, it managed to be exciting in some places, it even managed to be interesting in a few places. While this series has yet to really impress with anything it's shown so far, the fact that it's so willing to challenge its audience to think about new things and use such excruciating detail to make their stories flow it makes me curious to know what they are going to do with the second half of the series. This one isn't for the weak willed but if you're feeling up to the challenge, this series just might provide you with something worthwhile in the end."
2,godless,"Campbell says God is a force like Lucas talked about in Star Wars, having no personality and no sense of wrong or right. Lucas in his interview on the DVD was asked why he used the FORCE as a spiritual source of power and why there was a dark side of it. Lucas said he wanted to reach as wide an audience as possible regarding good and evil and heroes and villains, but if he used God in the equation he would narrow his audience. Lucas wanted to use God and believes he has a personality--without such a belief there would be no good and evil just a compassion less and unforgiving mankind.The retelling and insights of myths Campbell explains are wonderful. However, the foundation upon which all this stands is Campbell's theological belief system in the divine. This foundation is flawed. A poor foundation will lead to a house that falls to the ground."
5,The Miracle of Tithing,This book gave me a whole new perspective on giving and the influence it has on my life. I now am looking forward to who I will become as a result.
1,tthe miracle of tithing/mark victor hansen,"Will rate this book as an 8+.Chapters 4&6 were right on.Very pleased to get to read these two chapters.This is abook I would buy again to pass on. I have tithed as a new Christian in the mid 1970s.As I was not working I tithed on my food money.Have never gone with out since,P.T.L.,Bertha"
4,Really good gluten free bread,"This is one of the best, lowest calorie gluten free breads I have found. Both my children have celiac disease so finding a decent substitute for bread was a must with the constant requests for pbj, sandwiches and toast. It has some fiber with the brown rice and is low in calories; for a gluten free product, it tastes great. Best if toasted."
1,paper like substance,"no taste, no texture...one good thing you don't have to have teeth to eat it..."
2,Try something else,"This bread doesn't have a good flavor, smells weird and could not have possibly been made by someone with a wheat allergy or gluten intolerance. I would not recommend this product to anyone. There are brands that taste much better such as Outside the Breadbox in Colorado Springs."
1,Yuck :(,This bread was not good :( It was really dry and tasted like cardboard. I would suggest Bobs Redmill breads - they are the best I have found that are gluten free.
1,Terrible Taste,"This bread tasted bitter, nothing like the real thing. I boght six loaves and put them in the trash after tasting one slice."
3,Bland and dry,"This bread is edible but I wouldn't say tasty, and I found it fairly bland, and it needs lots of help in the form of jelly, honey, peanut butter etc. I will finish what we ordered, but won't be ordering more of it."
5,The BEST gluten free bread I've ever had!!!,When I first became gluten free I tried Udi's bread and it was so disguisting! I had to deal with the reality that I may never have anything close to bread again. This is the first Gluten Free bread I've tried that actually taste normal!! Especially toasted. Now I get to make all my favorite sandwiches again!! :)
1,why did the cost double?,"I was getting this with subscribe and save for just under fourteen dollars. It has been removed from subscribe and save and now they jacked the price to more than double???I for one protest a company that can offer this bread at less than half this price and then just double the cost over night without notice, or reason. I am tired of supporting greed and will switch to something else."
1,don't buy this,This is the nastiest bread that i have ever tasted it was like eating sheet rock and glue together i have not even been able to give this away its very very gross
3,Not great,"This bread works alright for toast, but that's about it. And it's not at all tasty unless it's toasted. However, when you do toast it, it becomes brittle & if you try to use it for a sandwich, it will crumble on you. If you don't toast it, it's mealy & flavorless. But, unlike ""good"" gluten free breads, it is light in calories, although part of that is that the pieces are very small, so again, that's a downer if you're looking for a sandwich bread. It will work well enough as toast or in recipes where bread or breadcrumbs are required."
2,"Edible, but just barely",I tried this product when I was first diagnosed. It is palatable & has a nice storage life outside of a freezer. I much prefer Udi's or Joan's Great Bakes for bread. They really taste like bread. This is just barely edible.
5,Toast Gluten Free Bread!,"I have tried a lot of different Gluten Free Bread. I would like to give some advice to any of you Celiac sufferer's. If you miss a good old fashioned sandwich because you can't eat regular bread, toast your Gluten Free bread. It makes it considerably less dry and sticky in your mouth. It is 100 times better this way and you will enjoy your sandwiches once again.As for Ener-G Foods Light Brown Rice Bread? It is very good. Remember toast your bread. You don't even have to toast it till it is dark. Just put it in the toaster for a few minutes."
4,Pretty Good,"Great flavor, light and fluffy, and good texture. Only down side is that the bread tends to dissolve with to much moisture, and has a tendency to be a little dry but great for sandwiches. Unlike other gluten-free breads that tend to be so heavy that they over power anything you put in the middle."
3,a good little bread with it's quirks,"when i recieved my bread i didn't realize how small the slices would be, but the size lends to appetizers or small sandwiches for kids. the bread itself has a sourdough taste to it which is cool, but it's really dry. it made me nervous about the bread that it had a long shelf life in a vacuum seal. i'm not used to that. i found myself eating less and less bread which is a good thing overall. i will keep the loaves to make breadcrumbs, veggie burgers and maybe a bread pudding. if you have to get a readymade bread, go for it. it's not terrible, but it's really different from the usual wheat bread that i now have to avoid. i think i will try my hand at making gluten free bread at home instead of relying on outside sources. i gave it 3 stars because though there were some things i didn't care for i still can see it used in other ways in the kitchen."
4,Good GF Bread,"This is the best GF bread I have tried so far. I would say the taste is on par with multigrain wheat bread...The size of the bread is fairly small, but it toasts well. The shelf life on it unopened is fantastic (1 year) so I didn't have to worry about taking up freezer space with all the loaves."
3,Bread:,I would recomend going with the 16 oz loafs. The slices in these 8 oz loafs are pretty small.
3,Ener-G Light Brown Rice Bread,"Ok for gluten free. The bread is well packaged to stay fresh. The loaves are pretty small (both the size of the slice and number of slices per bag). They are great for toast and OK for a sandwich. I think all the GF breads are a bit crumbly :) Cant fold it in half for half a sandwich but pretty good for a regular two piece one. Tastes good too, not as grainy a texture as some of the others a nice ""white"" bread substitute."
1,What a mistake!,I was recently diagnosed as being gluten-intolerant so I decided to buy a case of this bread based on the reviews. I almost gagged on this bread -- it was simply terrible. I have since found a gluten-free bread at Whole Foods by Udi's which is fantastic and I will never buy this Ener-G Foods Light Brown Rice Loaf again. What a waster of money! Don't do it!
3,Agree with review below,"Im not sure what kind of taste this is, but certainly not what i expected from the taste of bread."
1,HOLY COW A HORRID BOWL,"This bowl is SO not what I expected. If it has a 5-Qt capacity - it must mean to the rim and about to spill over. It was a waste of money, has a terrible texture feel like that of brick or broken glass. Lifting it feels like sliding hands on the concrete pavement. It does NOT grip the counter. It spills over easier than my ceramic bowls - the actual LARGE ones I purchased from Crate and Barrel. Checking into return policy - it seems an almost fraudulent posting."
2,Returned It,"I was expecting a book with more than just pictures of beautiful places, I wanted information also. It did not fulfill my needs so I returned it."
3,Won't fit Subaru factory cross-bars,"The item description says that it is ""Compatible with most round, square, and factory-included crossbars"" -- just be forewarned that this does NOT fit Subaru factory crossbars. I had to return it and go with the Yakima FrontLoader rack (purchased from my Subaru dealer), which looks very similar to this rack. FYI: the FrontLoader rack gets a full five star review from me."
5,High Rolling,"The quest for available vehicle storage space is a dilemma of the serious recreationalist. Management and utilization is the key. Yakima designs the tools to meet the needs. The HighRoller Rooftop Upright Bike Rack not only makes setting the bike in place easy, it provides security.As an owner of a Ford Explorer, with a growing Family the need for space to pack all the toys is as ever increasing challenge. Yamkima, does a great job in helping me meet the challenge. I give the HighRoller 5 out'a 5!How's that for a product plug !?"
2,beware of problems,"I've had mine for about 8 months now. The first problem was the batteries only lasted 6 months. Now it has developed a problem where it keeps reseting (may be batery contacts became loose) so I have to set up the ID between the transmitter and the head unit. It is a PITA to do that everytime. Last few days it got even worst, now everytime I go over a pot hole or bump it resets. So I've stopped using it. I'll contact Cateye to see if they offer a service to repair or replace it. IEven if I did not have this reset issue I'd say stay away from this, it is very tedious to use, for example to reset the counters I have to press 3 buttons all at once and when you are wearing gloves you can for get it. Even when I am not wearing gloves it is not easy to reset the counters."
3,Mixed review,"While this Wireless Cycle Computer has great features as described, I have found it difficult to use in practice. It is difficult to conveniently move between features and to reset the information it presents (e.g., time, distance, etc.) When I am not trying to reset the information presented, the CatEye is great. I should add that CatEye's customer service was great. When initially installing the Cycle Computer one of the pieces broke to attach the Computer to my bike's handlebars. After contacting Cat Eye, they promptly followed up with a replacement."
4,This Pack retails for 140,"I love amazonm, most of the time their deals can not be beat. In this case however, the retailer is well above asking price. This pack retails for 140, and you can find it on sale on websites like backcountry or rei for 125 and up."
2,Pretty repetitive,"Philip Dick is okay in small doses, but trying to read an entire book of his short stories was too much to bear. They're somewhat enjoyable, but when all of the stories are based on paranoia and alienation, it gets old really fast. Plus, the stories are very dated, featuring travelling salesmen, happy housewives, and the red menace. The only story contained here that I truly enjoyed was ""Second Variety"". This book could be more easily stomached if it didn't contain so many stories dealing with the same theme. It reminds me of that one-trick pony, HP Lovecraft."
3,Hint of Things To Come?,"The trend of late is to talk about Philip K. Dick as a 20th Century Edgar Allen Poe...considered a hack in his time, but after his death reconsidered as a seminal literary mind. This book is the first and so far only work by him that I have read and I haven't made up my mind if he really is destined for greatness or if the current attention to his work is due to the excellent movies (Blade Runner, Total Recall) based on his writing. The ideas of the stories in these books are incredible. However, I'm not bowled away by the quality of the writing. It's pulpy and two-dimensional in many places. That being said, I believe the stories in this book are by and large his earliest work, and his writing may have developed further over the years. These stories intrigued me enough that I plan to check out his novels, starting with The Man in the High Castle. Then I'll be able to decide for myself whether PKD will stand the test of time or if he's just a fad."
4,Good enough,"Perhaps I had too high expectations from this collection and I was bound to be disappointed. Don't get me wrong: there is plenty of good story telling here, which is pretty rare in the sci-fi literary world. Some of these stories are by now classics, and several movies have been inspired by some of the entries in this collection (usually the movies do not hold up to the writing, but that's not surprising). Dick had a clearly dark vision of humanity, and in particular of both government and corporations -- often pitted against each other in his stories, all the while crushing the average human being through their machinations. Then again, there is some comic (or at least, satyrical) relief here and there, and overall this is certainly a collection worth having, punctuated by the occasional true gem."
5,Absolutely funny and delightful to watch.,I enjoy almost anything that Rue McClanahan starred in so this was a big treat for me. I originally saw the DVD on PBS and just had to have one for myself. Truly enjoyed it!!
3,The Second Coming,"I have to say that I loved the first Nunsense. This one kinda left me wanting though. The humor and the chemistry from the first one wasn't here. It was funny, but just wasn't up to par with the first one. While I enjoyed the idea, it was just okay."
1,Stay away from this item if you are looking for a quality shirt,"I ordered the shirt about a month ago, which toke them over half a month to send it to me. then I had to return the shirt back right after I received it because of quality problem. even if I didn't expect a designers quality with this price I wasn't expecting such a low quality.I sent it back with regular mail, and it only toke them less than a week to re-emburs my money back with 20% less than what I orginionaly paid as it turned out they have hidden fee called ""Restocking Fee""Exchanges and returns will be processed less a 20% restocking fee within 7-14 business days after receiving the item in our warehouse. which I didn't expect.Therefore, I do not recommended this product unless you are looking for a very low quality product and ready to be ripped off 20% in case you change your mind and decided to return the item back."
1,didn't work for me...,"Lock cover mechanism broke- cover fell off, parts bouncing around inside the cap. Lock itself was beyond fussy- had to turn everything just right to function. Threw a P0440 code (evap) on my 2001 Suburban in the second week (cleared the code, replaced my OEM cap, and all is well.)I really wanted this to work, and I thought I was buying the best I could get, but it was a bad deal for me. Very disappointed."
3,Submarines and Anne Baxter,"Crash Dive was released the same year as Destination Tokyo, and I think the latter was the better film. Not to slam this movie too much, because it's entertaining enough. But the focus in Crash Dive is different, spending a considerable amount of time off the submarine as Tyrone Power and Dana Andrews clash over the affections of an incredibly beautiful Anne Baxter. The performances are as good as you could expect with this kind of material, and the action scenes are quite effective. But it's the kind of movie you can watch and then forget pretty soon afterwards. It's entertaining, but without much impact."
4,I Love this Movie,This has been a favorite movie of mine since I was a young boy and I'll continue to like this movie and watch it when ever I feel up to it. I'm 51 now. I like Submarine Classics especially.
4,Better Film Than One Expects,"Tyrone Power was an actor who men admired and women desired as the saying goes in Hollywood. He had charm and a mischevious sensbility that just spilled right off the screen. On his way Washington, naval officer Lt. Stewart (Tyrone Power) meets Anne Baxter. But she happens to be engaged to his future commanding officer. Complications galore. Still, the two men have a common enemy despite their rivalry - those damned Nazis. They must head through northern Atlantic waters to destroy some Nazi storage tanks for fuel. The able James Gleason who always plays a great crusty chief works well in the cast."
5,"Well done WWII film, extraordinarily realistic battle scenes. Good quality DVD,,,,,,","I have to admit I get goose bumps watching this film. It depicts the best of times in our history --a time that inspired patriotism and pride in our country. TYRONE POWER as Lt. Stewart was everything his fans wanted him to be - handsome, funny, heroic, romantic. Anne Baxter and Dana Andrews were well cast in their roles. Dame May Whtty was a darling, and Harry Morgan was a young submariner in one of his first movie roles.This movie won a well-deserved Oscar(1944) for Special Effects. Another interesting fact: at the time Ty Power was signed to play the role of a First Lieutenant in the Navy, in real life he had just enlisted as a Private in the Marines. Ty was already a very experienced pilot. He was to serve 3 years as a Marine pilot in the South Pacific flying the wounded out of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. At the time of his untimely death in 1958, he was a Major in the Marine Corps Reserves."
4,Crash Dive,"A nice movie not only centered at the battle action but also the human feelings and sentiments. The raid into the German secret base is most unlikely but since this movie is not a documentary but a fiction work, no problem."
3,Tyrone Power in one of his best action films.,"Tyrone Power shows us in this film, he's a real man, and a real ladies man with love interest Anne Baxter. Dana Andrews co-stars in this example of a fine war movie. If you collect war films, this one is a must."
1,not recommended,"this movie has good picture and sound quality, but is not realistic. there are a few good sub scenes, but the plot and specifics are poor. buy something better like ""run silent run deep""."
5,Power to spare,Tired of having to look for batteries all around the house. Well STOP! This Wall Power pack will stop all those tedieous moments and give you the power you need when you need it.
1,WORTHLESS,"Forms are given with pictures with little to no detail from one segment to another. Stance and proper technique are not written out well at all. I was hoping to learn some forms in both flute an stick but instead was given a bunch of pictures that leaves much left out from one movement to the next.Furthermore I was throughly not impressed with the fighting capablilities shown for both the flute and bo. I have taken 3 forms of martial arts (tae kwon do, jiu jitsu, and kung fu), so as a experienced martial artist I strongly advise against this book."
3,Does what it is supposed to do,"The Cayeye CC-RD200 Stada does what it is supposed to do. If it has an on/off function, I have yet to find it. It stays on all the time. The manual, if you can call it that, is lacking in specific instructions. I found better instructions on the Internet from other users. I had to fabricate and install spacers to get the sensors close enough to the magnets. The spacers are unsightly but serve their purpose."
2,Not worth it,"Pros:-Cheap-Pretty-Nice interfaceCons:-A pain to set up. Has to be put on the rear wheel, which means you have to zip-tie the cord to the frame every foot or so.-Finicky. My cadence sensor worked right off the bat. However, even after lots of tinkering, I couldn't get the speed sensor to work correctly.-Wire management is a pain.I gave this one a try... but in the end I returned it and when with the Cateye Strada Wireless, which took 2 minutes to install, and works perfectly."
4,Nice,"I love Cat Eyes products. However this one was a bit of a challenge to install. The geometry of my bike made it difficult to install the cadence sensor properly. After much tinkering, I had to use some ""home made"" riser block to put the magnet close enough in order to be able to use it. Not great looking but it works. Better installation instruction would have been nice too. And as usual, a few more plastic ties would have been nice (they always give the exact count that you will need)"
1,It was neat while it worked.,"Horrible product. After the initial installation, the product worked flawlessly when I tested it around my neighborhood. The next day, I took my bike out on the trails and the computer would only work with cadence and the speed would not be displayed. After going through troubleshooting, the unit worked fine after testing the contacts. Apparently there is an internal break in the wire that would not allow the signal from the sensor to reach the computer when docked. This is my first product from Cateye and I'm not pleased. I've had better experience with cheaper units. After owning this for less than 2 days, this is going back in the box and will be shipped back to Amazon."
3,Roadies only,"I wanted this type of computer for the cadence function, they fail to mention it's designed to fit a road bike only. I ride a GT outpost hardtail mtn bike that I converted to a commuter bike. To get the recommended spacing between the wheel magnet and speed sensor I had to fabricate a shim approximately 3/8th of an inch thick to make it work. other than that no issues so far."
4,great computer for the price,"The rd200 is an excellent computer for the price. The wires are not cumbersome, and having both speed and cadence for about $30 is a steal. The display is small (which I prefer), and only your current speed shows on the top display. Also, this does not give an average cadence (but that's only useful after the ride is over anyway). If this is your price range, and you don't mind the small display...this is the computer you should buy. (on the other hand, if you want to see all your stats and averages at once, look elsewhere.)"
3,my old astrale vs. my new strada,"my old astrale (with the same features) stop working, y buy the new strada, a little smaller than Astrale, better sensors, BUT my old astrale shows a cadence in a big large numbers, the strada only shows cadence in a lower smaller numbers... for me, the cadence sometimes is more important than the speed, in my astrale always hide the speed and only see the cadence and time, now, there is no way to hide the speed... and need to effort to see the cadence in a small numbers. only for this, 3 stars for this product."
2,What?,This was all too complicated for what I needed. I wanted a back wheel counter and I got a complicated computer system instead. Setting it perfectly took more skill and finesse than I could muster. I got it right finally but I used up all the plastic setting thingies than I could spare unfortunately.
3,Nice low cost computer,"Though wired, this is a nice easy to use bicycle computer. To access various data, you just tap the top of the unit which is easier than finding buttons. For the money, it works well."
1,Buyer Beware,Received Cateye Cadence Bike computer in mail from 'Buy New for Less /Regifters' and it was missing the pedal magnet and had frayed wires. Packageing looked like it had been repackaged and sold to me as is less all the parts with frayed wires. Attempts to return have been met with 'tough luck' because it was not opened right away (was being saved as a birthday present). Do not purchase from 'Buy New for Less /Regifters' they are a fraud and unloading defective product that has been recycled by them. When you try to return they will not help you. Their customer service department is from hell. Buyer beware.
3,my old cateye astrale vs the new strada,"this unit win in:better sensorlow weightmore stilyshBUTmy old astrale shows the cadence in a big large numbers, the strada ONLY shows the cadence in a tiny bottom numbers, for me, this is a big problem, because i use always the cadence, more than the speed in my trainings...i write to the cateye guys, and say ""in the future products maybe include this feature""..."
4,Good item for beginer tracking.,I was in the market for a good computer to track my spinning cadence and training distances.This is good for both of those. I have used it for triathlons and the modes/buttons are easy to navigate during a ride.Recommended for entry level bike computers.
2,Unsatisfied,"The installation instructions were very terse. After wasting a few zip ties and wiggling the sensor magnet a bit, the speed function started working. Cadence was a different thing. My crank arm, where the cadence magnet is to be fixed is recessed. To get to the 1-3 mm distance, i had to squeeze it very close to the pedal. I am always watching cadence, not speed. But it was literally a touch and go affair. Now after 3 weeks both cadence and speed were gone. The display unit was perfect, easy to read and switch modes. The short circuit technique produced numbers. I checked the wires. To the naked eye it looked OK. But no sensor reading seemed to reach the display unit. I have asked for an replacement to give this product another chance. Amazon's return policy is awesome. Fingers crossed."
4,"Great Display, Great Features....","I previously used schwin and Bell computers. Yes, cheap and simple like me! I decided after my Bell jammed and kept cycling past the desired numbers to check out something a little better. The design seemed simple and, as stated, a larger display. Mounting was comparable to my previous computers but a second sensor On the peddle is used for cadence. This one was an issue because I ride a recumbent. The distance between the crank arm and frame was too great. After crafting a PVC pipe fitting I had it done. My biggest surprise (and joy) was finding out I did not have to re-enter my wheel circumference every time I reset the computer. Thank you Cateye for a great product that is easy on this old guys eyes!"
4,cadence computer,"This is kind of a pain to install, but I think they all probably are. It does exactly what I need and I like how large the numbers are so it's easy to read while I'm riding. I bought it to replace my old computer that didn't have a cadence sensor. Now I can see my mileage when I'm riding my bike indoors on my trainer."
4,Works well,"Works well, easy install. I bought this because it can tell me cadence and I can use it on an indoor trainer. Great tool for training.I wish it would turn off and I don't know how to change the time though--"
5,I just love it!,"I ordered my CatEye Cadence bike computer and it got in fast and good. It was actually smaller than what I thought so it looks fantastic in my mountain bike. It took me a couple of hours to install it. It just works terrific!... I have a cadence computer that has a long lasting battery now! as it does not perform wireless communication. Another thing that I loved is the ""one button control"" that allows me to easily change display options on the go. Very happy with it. Thanks CatEye, Thanks Amazon!"
5,Love it so far,"This computer had everything I really wanted and was such a good price.I had it installed at a local bike shop because I didn't feel like messing with it since alot of the reviews made it sound difficult and I had installed a simpler one (without cadence) years ago and remember it being kind of a pain. I am so glad I had them install it because they needed like 5 spacers to make it the right distance from the sensor and they have those on hand whereas I would have had to improvise. So I recommend having it installed at a shop (cost me 24 dollars, don't know what other places would charge). I have had zero problems with it so far (but only gone about 30 miles with it since installation)."
5,A great little computer....,...and a minor miracle at $34. Have just started time trial-ing and this fits the bill. Knowing cadence is REALLY helpful and being able to fit this on the stem means it is out of the way of my aero bars. Seems to work just as well as my Cateye Mity 8 ever did. Highly recommended.
4,Easy to install but...,"Just got this installed on my road bike (Trek 1.2) - it was fairly easy to install (although the instructions take a little bit of work to follow). My only problem is that the cadence sensor and magnet are too far apart. Another review indicated the problem was solved by switching the sensor rubber pad to the cadence sensor, but I am already using the sensor pad for the speed sensor.Guess it's time to order a new pad from Cateye."
2,Cadence sensor/magnet are too far,"When I tried to install the cadence magnet on my Fuji CCR3 road bike, I found that the magnet on the pedal was too far from the sensor no matter where I attach it to. So, I gave a lot of padding to the sensor using a styrofoam. But the cadence sensor fell off somewhere within a mile. Then, I took it to a pro shop to install it. They removed the sensor padding and installed a new magnet using a rubber padding. Again, the sensor fell off within a few miles. I bought this product mainly for cadence feedback. I would never buy this again. Nor, I would recommend this to a friend."
1,Good while it lasted,"This computer was good while it lasted. I bought it in March. At the end of May the main sensor started to shut off sporadically - the speed indicator would go to 0 in the middle of the ride, then would turn back on 20 min later. This became progressively worse and by mid June it died completely. A week ago the cadence sensor bit the dust too. I expected a longer lasting piece of electronics from a Japanese company..."
3,Nice computer with a few design flaws,"The Strada Cadence is reliable and accurate but I have a few complaints. First, when installing the computer on most bikes, achieving the necessary clearance between the sensors and magnets requires installing a shim that you have to make yourself (the instructions say nothing about this) between the sensor and the bicycle frame. Second, while the one button system of scrolling between modes is easy to do, it requires scrolling between all modes in order to get the display you want. Also the reset feature is easy to inadvertently activate. I mounted my computer on the bicycle stem and that is also a favorite place to hold my bicycle resulting in resetting the computer when I don't really want to. I guess I'll learn over time."
2,Good while it worked,"I used this product for about 3 months before it suddenly stopped working. I had it professionally installed at a local bike shop. However as others have mentioned, the contacts between the unit and the wiring harness degrade over time.I've tried all the troubleshooting recommendations on the manufacturer's website, confirming that the problem is definitely in the wiring or contacts. I'm looking for a new model now."
1,Missing parts,"Twice ordered and twice missing a the crank magnet. (Apparently no way to communicate with anyone at Amazon about this problem.) Set up, until discontinued, was not successful as new bike frames with non symmetrical tubing did not adapt well to mounting system, including the wheel magnet which was too deep and required mounting on far spoke for clearance."
2,Wouldn't buy again,"Had this item for 25 miles, and it stopped working. Lined up the sensors a million different times, replaced the unit battery, and it still won't pull up cadence or miles."
4,Cateye Strata Cadence,I bought this computer for a new road bike I just received. The install was relatively simple with no hitches. It appears to be well designed and laid out. I would prefer the display to be slightly larger for ease of reading. The only reason I'm not rating this computer higher is I've only used it a few times and haven't had time to use it much. In general I'm very pleased with both the price I paid and how it's functioned so far.
3,Would be better without the deletions,"I saw this in the theatre when it first came out. A fun film.I bought the VHS, & it's still fun. However, there is a LOT missing: several musical items [""Do You Believe in Magic"" - in French, in the opening scene on the bus; ""Lotta Love"", as noted in another review; ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"" - in the scene with Mme. Tessier dancing w/ Alex at the end-of-year party] and several changed scenes.The movie would be better ""restored"" & without deletions. I read somewhere that there were rights issues on some of the songs, and that some of the actors were not eager for this film to be released on video. The movie is remarkable for the pre-fame appearances of some actors and actreesses, as others have mentioned.Buy the video, but if you somehow get a chance to see the actual film, I think you'll like the film better."
3,Great Miles Chapin Vehicle,"Fans of Miles Chapin (star of ""Bless the Beasts and Children"", ""Hair"" and ""Howard the Duck"" as well as at least one star-turn on ""Murder She Wrote"") won't want to miss this forgotten gem. This is probably the only known documentation in film or literature of the practice of making FREE international phone calls from pay phones in Paris, an important phenomenon in the 70's. The movie is also notable for a brief appearance by Debra Winger in what may well be her first speaking role in a movie."
5,GIVE US THE ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK!,"I loved this movie when they played it on HBO back in the 80's. One of the best things was all the pop songs done in the French language like ""Do You Believe In Magic?"" and ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?"". I hadn't seen it in over 20 yeras and was overjoyed when I saw it was coming out on DVD. Imagine my horror to hear they replaced most of the soundtrack with elevator muzak! All the great songs were gone! This would be like the French ""American Grafitti"". Of course it was done to save money. George Lucus has said that he paid more for all those old songs in ""American Grafitti"" than he would have paid for an original soundtrack. But I still want the original ""French Postcards"" restored! Even if it was more money!"
3,music Mess,"It is still a charming film, but the butchering of the music is inexcusable.At one moment, I turned to my viewing friend and stated that one of the best marriages of scene to music was about to take place. I was livid thay ""Just One Look"" had been removed from the scene where Alex is spying on the ever beautiful Pisier in the changing room. Bring back a version with the entire original score.Anyone have an idea of where I can find these originals or how to edit the original back in?"
3,Say no to the scarecrow!,Scarecrow dude scares my 2 year old son and me. He won't watch the four of the five episodes that feature the thing. Really likes the one episode without the creature.
1,This charger burned out my Android tablet.,"I bought this charger to have a second one and it was listed on Amazon for several devices, among them was my Coby Kyros tablet. When it arrived I plugged it in and the battery indicator showed the charge going down, not up. Then I smelled smoke and so I pulled it out of the tablet. I tried to use my other charger which worked fine for running the tablet but I noticed that it no longer charges the battery. It burned up the charging circuit or the battery or both. Also, without a charged battery, the power needed to keep the date and time was not there. Now I have to reset the date and time each time I plug it in just to use it. I've contacted the seller but haven't heard back yet. I'm going to have to buy a new tablet and throw this one away. Be aware of what you buy!"
3,Flight Yoke,"I purchased this product a time ago, an once I got it I wished if I have paid extra dollars and bought the more advanced one with three quadrant, the only problem with this yoke its all made from Plastic, which is unstable after use, I wish if the yoke was attached with the main body with a stainless steel for accuracy. However its not bad as a start"
5,Good value,I've used this yoke for four years now. I think it is a good value. I am a pilot (ATP/CFII). I use the CH yoke and pedals with the X-Plane simulator to fly practice instrument approaches. I find my real IFR flying is much sharper if I fly the sim when I haven't been in the clouds for a week or two. I haven't had any instability. The only time I have had to adjust settings is after upgrading to a new version of X-Plane. I recommend this yoke to my friends.
1,useless,We were looking for walkin closet designs and there was nothing in this book that we could use. Would not recommend if you are looking for designs to choose from.
5,"Great musical arrangements, moving lyrics, wonderful vocals","""One Deed"" by Tony Vincent offers its listeners the best of everything--great musical arrangements, moving lyrics and wonderful vocal stylings by an incredible young singer. The talent represented on this CD is nothing short of miraculous! All his listeners should look forward to his upcoming release with great anticipation."
2,Not very good,"I ordered this movie as a gift for my cousin. She watched it, didn't care for it and sent it to me to watch. I didn't care much for it either. I had to really force myself to watch it to the end.It is nice to see a film about Armenians, especially one where the characters are speaking Armenian. Other than that, I found the storyline terrible at best, mediocre acting, with very little insight of life in Armenia either before or after independence. If one gauged life in Armenia from this film, it would seem that all people did there was to sit around a table and eat all day long.Except for a couple of outside shots, the film could have been made entirely in a film studio, anywhere. I found viewing another relative's collection of digital photos from a recent trip to Armenia, much more interesting and enlightening."
2,The Journey,"Mine started in English,half way,switched to Armenian with NO SUBTITLES,had to turn it off,could not understand.....too bad,seemed like a great movie...."
3,PSP Headphones are OK if you can stand its' faults,"OK, so the price is great, but there is a Home Depot a few blocks from my house. Therefore, I didn't need to order these headphones online if I wanted to know what it felt like to put my head in a vice. After wearing these headphones for a few hours my ears hurt a great deal from being forced against the side of my head. So much for all the promises of comfort in the product description.Overall though, the headphones do deliver great sound with only a slight amount of distortion with higher pitch sounds. I just started using the headphones so I've yet to discover whether they are as easily broken as stated by some of the other reviewers. My guess is they break due to the constant readjustment to keep the headphones from collapsing ones skull."
1,Sony PSP PlayGear Mod Headphones,Good sound but the headphone frame snapped in half after several weeks of use.
2,Not real impressed ..,Good thing the headphones weren't very expensive ... Since there was nothing particularly memorable about them.
1,DO NOT BUY,"DO NOT BUY THIS, i had it for 4 days and that snapped in half when i tried to take them off"
3,Really great sound! but...,"I got this item and I thought: ""it's really cool and a great sound!"" but just three month and now it's broken... don't buy it :(Only 2 Stars"
2,"OK Computer, Crappy Screen","The unit works well after 500 miles. I didn't find the instructions as troublesome as some reviews indicated. My difficulty is the screen. It seems to be a bit polarized and is difficult to read from even a slight angle. Had I not had it on the bike and accurized when I figured this out, I would have returned it. I reinstalled the wire ties and changed the angle which improves the view but does not completely correct the difficulty."
4,Works Perfectly,"Works well, easy to install, easy to navigate the screens, and having a bike computer makes riding more fun for me. After getting used to it, I now just wish that I bought one with a cadence sensor. I like this just fine, though!"
4,Great Computer,"A lot of features packed into a slim package. Good visibility even in sunlight. Good mounting bracket/options. Fast installation. Fairly easy set up, just have the instructions with you. Only downside is the tiny buttons on the back. The one is the set up button that you only use when you initially set it up. But the other is the backlight. I ride a lot at night and it is a little difficult to acces. Especially with my headlight mounted next to it."
3,Nice features for the price.,"Installation and usage was a snap. I really like the size, position and read-out. My complaint is the timer/counter keeps stopping during my rides. I am not hitting the stop button or any buttons, yet it always halts during my last 3 rides. It may be from hitting bumps in the road, not sure. I am frustrated by this problem and hope I can solve the issue soon."
3,Cyclocomputer,"The computer works good at keeping tract of your speed and distance. The amount of time it took to get it was very short. I think that the owner's manule could be a little more straight forword, and the instructions on how to navigate through the different settings should be more clearer to read. Other than that, the product is well worth the money."
1,Worked for several months but now randomly moves to zero MPH,"I used to really like this device, but lately it intermittently will go to zero MPH and thus my miles do not get recorded. For example, on a route I know is 22 miles it will only say 17 miles -- that is a lot of missing miles. When I watch the display it will be correct, but then suddenly go to zero MPH. I'll then be biking and fiddling with the device to wake it up and then it will start displaying real numbers again. I don't trust it and now must go spend the money and time finding / buying / setting up a new device. So, just be warned that although it initally is a good computer within a year it turned out to be worthless..."
1,ridiculous,"I can't give a complete assessment of this item, because as of yet, I have been unable to use it. I put it on my bike (which required me to go back to college to get another degree to figure out the directions) and it does not work.Best I can determine is that the sensor and the computer are too far apart. Problem is, I can't remove it without cutting the nylon ties to remove the brackets. So before I can try it again, I will have to acquire more nylon ties.I am confused as to why the product attaches to the bike with this type of bracket. The device gives you the option to input information for two different bikes, yet there is no practical way to switch it from one bike to another (again, you would have to cut the nylon straps.)"
5,Excellent Product,This is a great help when working out with the bicycle. I can tell how far I have gone and in what time I make the trip. This helps to decide what kind of work out I would like to do and how fast to do it based on my physical condition on that day. You see I am 56 years young and really am not able to push as hard as most people would on a bicycle. So I have to be careful since my heart attack.
1,Nothing Good to Say,"Right now this product is sitting in an open box on my desk. When I installed it on my Mongoose it turned out that the sensor and the magnet were too far apart to get a reading. Nothing stated that it would not work with a Mongoose bike. The only way I could find this out was to open it and install it. When I tried to return it to the retailer, Niagra Cycle Works, they refused return because it was opened. I would appreciate it if any one can tell me how I would know it didn't work unless I opened it, I would love to hear it. I have contested the charge on my credit card and will see what happens. I will probably lose but at least others will see this and hopefully cost Niagra Cycle Works more then the stinking $40 it cost me."
1,Compnay that sold this has no customer service,"I bought this bike computer as a christmas gift for my girlfriend but it turned out that her parents had also bought her one and she had opened that one first. I wrote to the retailer, USBIKEBARGAINS, through Amazon and asked if I could return it. I said I would be happy for store credit and would just buy some other bike equipment. However, the company never even replied. They didn't acknoledge my email and they can't be found on-line. I wouldn't suggest buying this, not because of the product but because the retailer is either really badly run or not really a company."
4,Great device/substandard instructions,"This is a great device in terms of functionality and due to the zip-tie mounting option it fits thicker handlebars and forks (my bike is a Cannondale Synapse with a carbon fork). I agree with some of the other reviewers that whoever authored the instructions should get fired. They are in diagram form only and it took me forever to figure out in which sequence I was supposed to push buttons to get through the set-up. I am pretty computer/tech savvy but this was certainly a new level of a challenge. Once done, this unit has been great. I deducted one star because of the manual only, not because of functionality."
3,Mounting system is not good but the computer is great!,"The computer is great, it has a lot of functions and features and the wireless works very well. The only thing I was dissapointed was the mounting system, it is with nylon ties while the Strada Wireless has the ""FlexiTight"" Bracket Mount which has a faster installation. Besides if I need to switch it to another bike is faster and I don't need to have spare nylon ties with me."
3,Not too reliable. Careful with the sensor.,"The monitor itself does everything it promess to do, however, the sensor is weekly mounted on the wheel, and if it by chance move a little bit due a radical stunt, or a rock, or somehting that hits the wheel... Your speed drops dramatically on the monitor... so you never know if it's working properly, or if the sensor moved... Maybe, if you do something to make sure the sensor will not move -- it's a great monitor."
4,This is the best.,"I have two ""Wired"" CatEye mirrors and they are great. The wirless one is even better. I had another brand that you couldn't read in bright sunshine, but the CatEye ""wireless"" can be read in any light (Yes, it even has a back-light for night).The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that the operating/set-up instructions are poor."
5,Reliable and durable,"I purchased this speedometer a month ago and I am very pleased with it. I have biked over 200 miles and each ride it holds true to its readings with prior rides, very consistent. Highly recommended!"
4,"Pleased, and would buy it again",This is the first bicycle computer I've purchased but CAT EYE provides a rosetta stone of guidance in no fewer then twelve languages and with their instructions I installed my computer in just a few minutes.I use my bicycle daily to commute several miles to and from work as well as for recreation on the weekends and after several hundred miles my computer is still performing flawlessly.My only complaint is that some careful button pressing technique is required to reset daily trip time and distance. Two buttons must be held for the reset but part of the same button sequence changes modes between bicycle one and bicycle two.For the price I would happily order another computer for a second bike and forego this feature in favor of more intuitive display of ride-leg information or perhaps even an additional button to simplify reset.The best designs promote intuitive operation but I'm happy with the product and with practice I'll master the technique.
3,"Lots of info, but beware of interference","In terms of capturing information, the only things this baby doesn't have are cadence data and power data. That said, if you put it in ""automatic"" mode -- preferred for urban riding, when you are doing a lot of traffic stops -- it is highly prone to radiofrequency interference from everything from store security scanners to laptop computers. I have seen it tell me I'm riding at 75mph when I'm standing still at a red light, and I've seen it change my odometer information overnight between logging a ride on a training journal and putting it back on my bicycle in the morning.The newer, higher-end wireless models are apparently less prone to interference. That said, I'd rather run the wires and have accurate information."
4,Cateye Computer,"Very nice computer, and appears to be very accurate in all regards. Easy to install, but directions for programming need some work. Found third party instructions online, and it was easy from that point."
1,The manual is sooooooo user UNfriendly!,"The new user had better count on the dealer or a friend to walk them through the setup for this thing, especially the clock. There is this international, symbolic guide that seems intended to help the user with setup. It is practically useless. Perhaps there are other reviews here or elsewhere that will help the new owner."
4,good computer,"I owned two previous wired versions of cateye computers, I like the product but suffered with issues regarding the cable, so decided to give a try with wireless. Easy to install, configuration and functions very similar to my previous mity and enduro models, so far so good after three weeks of light use, time will tell if it keeps working great. My bike is an XL Scott mtb and 70 cm distance from computer to sensor seems a more than adequate clearance to feet any mtb."
3,This camera is very cute but does not work very well,"The teeth that hold the film in place while you are winding the camera are so short that the film keeps slipping back off after you take the first picture. It does have a very cute design and the little photo album is cute as well. If you are buying this for a smaller child (approx 3 years) to be used for pretend play (even without film in it the camera will make the winding and clicking sounds) then this will be great for you, but if you actually want to be able to take pictures you'll probably want to go with something else."
1,barbie cameras are junk!,"My 9 year old daughter has received a couple of different barbie cameras. Yes, they are cheap. However, after using them a few times each, they stop working completely. Even if you use these outdoors they still come out dark. We've decided to buy the instant cameras. At least those work and have flashes and the pictures come out."
3,Tolerable commentary on Livian selections,"This is a reprint of an early-twentieth century commentary on selections about Hannibal from the third decade of Livy's Ab Urbe Condita. The age shows, especially in the introduction (which suggests that Roman, western European culture was more ""virile"" than Carthaginian, ""eastern"" civilization). From a practical perspective, the book is of uneven value for an intermediate-level Latin student. The selections are generally interesting and have a good balance of action and speeches. The notes are few and not uniformly useful, but there is a pretty comprehensive vocabulary at the end of the text. Also annoying is the fact that there is no indication of precisely where in Livy each selection may be located, for students wishing either to check their translation or read intervening passages."
5,A True Classic,"If you're like me and most of the rest of the world and are completely sick and tired of what commercial radio has evolved into, i.e. the tired, boring and unimaginative non-stop drivel of John Mellancamp, buy this cd. Discover what the true meaning of ""deep classic"" really means. Being an import, it will cost you a little more. However, you'll be able to cancel your subscription to ......since ""When A Woman Say She Ready"" is all you'll need on those cold evenings you find yourself alone and lonely. Trust me...enjoy!! Help stamp out canned radio!!"
2,Not a good introduction to Rilke,"Although the book may be useful for those who like to crossreference different translations, I would strongly discourage anyone from using this book as an introduction to Rilke. Though I cannot attest to how well the poems were translated from the German, I can say that these poems did not flow as well in English as other translations I have read. Text is English only, and the translator did not list which of Rilke's works the poems were selected from, making crossreferencing more difficult."
2,Looks good but doesnt work well,"this product looks nice and everything but there are some major flaws. First off, the plastic piece used to screw the knob on, is plastic and therefor does not go on tight enough. It constantly rotates while you are trying to shift it. also the pin is quite loose and tends to rotate around and vibrate quite loudly as i am driving. If you can fix or deal with these two issues, the grenade looks great. otherwise, dont bother with it."
3,Ehhhhhh.....,"I purchaed this for my scion tc. I spray painted mine black cause I am not a fan of chrome. The sleeves don't really work the way they are supposed to. It comes loose alot. After awhile the top part starts to rattle. I had to make my own adapter sleeve to make it fit. It is also very heavy! But that was expected. The style is great, It is a hit in my car but I wouldn't buy this again I would go with something else."
3,Not bad,"Got the shift knob today, has good weight to main part but the top part (top and handle) are made of plastic so they kinda look and feel cheap. Had to crazy glue top part because rattle of handle was gettin annoying"
2,It's ok,It is ok for shorter shift levers but mine keeps shaking lose And therefore will not work And I Wouldn't recommend it for like trick shift levers
1,DID NOT FIT RIGHT,The Grenade Shifter looks Great bus does not fit my stick at all. very disappointed on how they made it.
3,looks good gets loose easy,"My husband got this because his original knob came lose and was coming off. We got this very fast, but as soon as we put it on, we left inthe car and it came loose within 20 minutes."
4,"Great Buy, Fits Snug!",This is a great buy. I'm in the military so I love this theme. The reason I only gave it four stars is because it is a little large and takes some getting used to. Maybe if it was slightly shorter and more round I would give it 5. :D
3,Amon Duul II - 'BBC In Concert Plus' (Windsong) 3 1/2 stars,"Recorded at the BBC in early 1973,not quite as astounding as their landmark 'Live In London' release(see my review),but still decent.Highlights here include ""Ladies Mimiky"" and ""Trap"",both off of the 'Vive La Trance' lp and ""Kanaan"" from the 'Phallus Dei' album.It's great to see a live gig with completely different tunes played.The two bonus cuts added here,""Marilyn Monroe Memorial Drums"" and ""Chewing Gum Telegram""(alternative mix)are okay.Mainly aimed toward big-time AD II fans."
2,Putty,"Product is absent of an attractive scent, looks and feels like putty, and is extremely greasy. I gave it away after one use."
4,I'm Cool Now...,These are some darn fine looking sunglasses. The only problem is that the lenses are so light that I still have to squint while looking toward the sun. They are very comfortable on my face though.
3,Nice glasses - not so good lenses,"I bought Bolle Fusion Limit with polarized TNS lenses. Glasses are nice and relatively well designed and built. However, lenses are not the best ones - compared with Rayban, which falls in the same price category - Bolle is on the bad side when it comes to protecting your eyes from the sun.Seller, Ace Photo Digital, was good though."
4,Amazing book for its price!,One of my favorite artbook purchases. It has some really great prints of master artist's works and analyzes them to a great detail. Has good information on the skeleton system as well. If you like text based artbook with lots of technical details and explanations..then this is a great buy!
4,Good book,for us amateaur artists who want inspiration to create great works of art. This book shows the details of the human body and how great artists drew from live and dead bodies as they create the greatest masterpieces in art history.
3,Muscles and tendons to bone structures,"The book is very charming and it has some good points. The overall assessment is not 5 stars because, the work chosen is not always first rate. The artists chosen ARE first rate but better drawings could have been analyzed occasionally. This is a problem with most Old Master Drawing books, it's not enough to have a Rembrandt, there are good and better Rembrandt drawings! Choose the better ones."
2,Over-worked pseudo-intellectualized error-packed compendium,"This book is best used for viewing its selection of Master Drawings many of which are superb. However, its written text is filled with multitudes of factual errors and pseudo-intellectualizations. It should be noted that this book was not written by Hale; it was written by one of his students and lacks the quality of Hale's classic, ""Drawing Lessons from the Great Masters."" Instead, this book loses itself in unimportant, erroneous anatomical minutia which will baffle, confuse, frustrate and ultimatly demoralize the motivated reader. It greatly misses the mark in both clarity and presentation of important anatomical theory."
4,"For dancers only, great","I studied with Zena in NYC in my dancing days. As a teacher it's a great tool for the technique and the history behind her efforts. For dancers only, of course. The dance vocab is used and I can't imagine any people other than intermediate to professional dancers understanding how to use it to get the full benefit. My dancers love it on pre and post performance weeks."
2,Would not play,This DVD would not play on my computer or DVD player (or any of my friends or family's devices.)Emailed the seller. They promised to send a new DVD but never did.
1,NOT the Pliers shown in the photo,"I was looking for the pliers in the picture and didn't research the part number or read the ad carefully enough because it says Int/Ext convertible pliers and the pliers in the pic are ext only but, I still think its misleading that they show a pic of the wrong pliers."
4,Easy and convenient,"Good enough for school homework and assignments, reasonable size and price and easy to use. The only problem I have is the price of the ink, quite expensive, (...). Over all, I'm happy and satisfied with this printer."
1,Deskjet 3520 is a mistake...,"The good news about the printer is that it is cheap and easy to setup. The disappointment starts from the time you try and print the first page. I would recommend it only:(a) if you already own a USB cable (most likely with your USB cd/dvd-writer etc)(b) if you print two/three pages a week(c) do not care about printing in grayscaleMy gripe list is:1) Does not ship with USB cable2) Does not ship with black ink cartridge (I may be asking for the world here)3) Feeds multiple papers unless 15-20 pages are positioned in a specific way4) *Biggest gripe *: If you need to print in grayscale, then you need to physically remove the color cartridge. It has no software enabled 'checkbox' option that lets you toggle between color and grayscale.Oh, I forgot about a good feature: it has a rear access door that can be used to remove paper jams."
3,Spending all my money on ink!,"Ok, the good stuff first. It's compact and quick and easy to set up and has been reliable so far. But, my Lord, the ink this thing runs through!!! I've had it less than three months, and have already had to buy one color cartridge and three black cartridges.More and more, I wish I'd bought a low-end laser printer. If you don't need the color, that's the way to go. The Laserjet 1012 costs less than $150 and gets an estimated 2000 pages out of every $70 toner cartridge. That's 3.5 cents per page. Estimates I've read for inkjets run around 25 cents per page. And at $80 spent on ink so far, I'm living that dream."
2,The Great Price is deceiving...,It doesn't come with a USB cable ($22) or black ink ($18) so don't fool yourself thinking this is a bargain compared to the other ones you are looking at...
1,Ink hog,"One principle of economics is that you sell the razor cheap and charge through the nose for the blades. This works well for razors, but most people would revolt if they could only get half of a shave per blade. I haven't gone through a single 500 page ream of paper, but am already on my third $18 cartridge. That comes out to 33 cents a page, folks. Printing in draft or manually refilling the cartridges are the only options."
1,cheap price tag is a trick,"Low price tag is a trick as (though editorial review states otherwise) package DOES NOT include black cartridge ($19).You will also need USB cable ($15) - not included.If you start using this printer without the black, color cartridge will run-out in less than 100 pages, new color cartridge is $21...Otherwise, only advantage of this printer is it's compact design.Very slow."
1,3520 is a joke,set up easy but paper jam after jam its a joke unless its dmagedHewlett Packard Deskjet DJ3520 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Copier
3,Not enough information when ordering,"If I had realized that this has no black cartridge and cable I would have purchased an upgraded model that did or another brand. It's compact size and price are what I bought and felt that it works well but without a black ink cartridge, you really burn up the color cartridge fast which is more expensive, maybe that was HP's plan?? All in all it's okay but I bought for price and feel mislead."
2,Worst I have ever owned,"Worst printer I have ever owned. Every print job, I have to clear a paper jam. Never have printed something without a problem. Only had it a few months and it will not even pull paper into the printer now. Going into the trash."
4,Good Little Printer,This printer is perfect if you do little printing or the occasional image. The one I bought at Best Buy came with all the ink and a USB cable. Easy easy easy installation with no direction reading required. Set it up in about 5 minutes.
2,HP DeskJet 3520 Color Printer,"the print quallity was not bad, really.i wanted to print dvd covers. one should be able to do that on letter size paper. however, there was an 1/8"" boarder, whether i asked for it or not!!!also, how long are those ink carts supposed to last? i think i did about 20 prints and it was through! the lady at walmart told me it was a full ink cart that came with it"
3,O.K. for haircare workers,"The price and info is good if you work with hair. If not, check it out from a library or read a friends."
4,Natural Hair Care and Braiding,This book was in very good condition and it was very helpful and educational. It is a good reference tool that I plan to use for many years.
3,Good pictures but pricey for the information given.,"I probably have all of the books available on African/curly/coily hair and this book was expensive and not for the do-it-yourselfer. There are definitely less expensive books that offer better value. In my opinion, the books ""Let's Talk Hair"" by Pam Ferrell, and ""No Lye"" by Tulani Kinard offer excellent photographs, hair care tips, and how-to-do-it style information. ""Good Hair"" by Lonnice Bonner is also good besides being fun to read. By the way, I have what Ferrell calls 75% shrinkage hair and I love it!"
5,The Natural Hair Care Bible,"This is the definitive book on styling and caring for natural hair. The book is large and has loads of information.It had everything from sanitation,consultations, essential oils to the how tos of braiding, locking and styling an afro. I have had this book a while and I still have not finished reading it. I have already tried a couple of styles on my daughter and the book was really helpful. As I get deeper into the natural care business I will use this book more and more. I have not gotten into essential oils and herbs yet but it is good to know that there is a whole chapter on that.The only thing that is missing is there isn't anything written about Sisterlocks (tm). This system has been around since 1994 but is relatively new in some areas. Sisterlocks (tm) are showcased in No Lye and Let's Talk Hair, my other favorites."
3,Good,"I think the book was good but it could have been better. I agree with another review which said that techniques on palm rolling and flat twists were scant. It would have just been better to leave these two styles out, than to have step-by-step instructions on other styles and nothing on these two. I am guessing Mrs. Bailey and her associates do not want to give away too many tips and secrets and it left me a little disappointed. Overall the good was very good but I agree the instructional portion should have had bigger, clearer pictures. I liked ""Let's Talk Hair"" better also."
4,Great buy!,"I've had my drive for almost a year, and so far things run great. I feel there is less risk, when you limit your drive to an amount around 80-120GB.My only issue was the FireWire cord itself. This did not snugly fit into my Apple G4 laptop, and kept popping out, of course causing the unpleasant error window to appear regarding improper disconnection.I did have another cord around the house, so that should be an easy problem to fix for you."
5,Powerful Chant!,"The first time i heard this, I could feel it in all my cells. Its like a sweet nectar moves through you and holds your being in pure love. The more you open to it, the more you can go deep into this sweet trance it evokes. i love to sing along with the beautiful voices that sing from their heart and carry you away.Om Tryambakam YajamaheSugandhim PushtivardhanamUrvarukamiva BandhananMrityor Mukshiya MaamritatThe meaning is profoundly beautiful as well. If chanting is the way you like to pray, get this one!!!"
3,Where are Unseen Power and Wake Up Call???,"Nothing off of Unseen Power? Come on, the songs ""Dance"", ""Destiny"" and ""Hey World"" are some of the best songs they ever did! And Nothing from Wake Up Call either. I see a pattern here. No John Schlitt music. He was a great big part of Petra and his work should be represented here also. Since it isn't, I will only give this compilation of songs 3 stars. That is like KISS doing a reunion tour with the original members and not playing any of their 80's music. I was there and couldn't get into the music. Same thing here, I want to hear John Schlitt, as well as Greg."
2,"Okay, I'm gonna be the pin that pops your balloon.","Unless you have no Petra albums at all or unless you just got to have ""Rock Block"", then ignore this review. It will not be positive.As much as I love Petra, I'm gonna have to be the neighborhood cynic on this CD. It basically is a repackaged ""Petra Means Rock"" CD (1989). The only difference is the ""mega-hit"" medley (track 1) where several Petra songs are fused together to make a ""new"" song.Don't blame Petra. They do not own their music. Blame the music industry who has all the copyrights. Star Song Records is the entity who re-released dozens of Petra songs with shiney new wrappings. This is only one of several ""new"" Petra CD's.If you have been paying attention, Star Song is also trying similar marketing schemes with other artists such as Twila Paris and Whiteheart. Buyer beware ... unless you just got to have this one."
3,Will Leave You Hungry For More,"I enjoyed this book. It is well written and interesting and I learned quite a bit. The reason I only gave it 3 stars is that the book is too short. There are sections where you wish Mr. Schivelbusch had fleshed things out a bit. The book has many interesting illustrations but in a 228 page book over 100 pages of illustrations are just too much! So, be forewarned! If you are looking for some depth to sink your teeth into this is not the book for you. However, if you are satisfied by small portions than by all means.....Bon Appetit!"
5,Simple and Lucid View of Stimulants Throughout History,"This book is so easy to read that you might not believeit's written by a serious German sociologist.Especially given our current coffee craze, it's fascinatingto see when different stimulants (coffee, tea, chocolate, etc.)came into popularity in history.For example, before the 17th century, all they drank in Englandwas coffee. Then strangely, they totally switched to tea andthere doesn't appear to be any logical explanation.But, to sum up, this is actually a FUN sociology book."
4,Left me wanting more,"And I see from the reviews below that I wasn't the only one. The author has really picked a fascinating subject, and brings it to life, weaving together strands of economics, sociology, geography, and chemistry to explain some of the impacts that these now-commonplace items have had on Western culture. (And what impacts our culture has had on the items - did you know that chocolate was a drink for monks and aristocrats before it became a snack for children?)But the book is far too short. Many subjects are merely glanced over, and the illustrations, in addition to being so numerous as to be suspected of being filler, are often dark and hard to make out. I would have rather seen the author do a book this size on any one of the various subjects at hand - just coffee, say, or just pepper - and really explored it in depth."
4,She loved the book,Product came way ahead of scheduled date. The packing was great and product was protected. Product exceeded expectations. I will recommend this company to friends and use them in the future. Friend is studying intoxicants and the history of them. She loved the book.
4,tasty book,Good overview of the subject. Interesting tale from a sociological perspective. Excellent translation.
4,Not 10 piece 9 piece,The set has 9 screwdrivers in it not 10 the picture is wrong. Don't expect to get 10 drivers u will disappointed. Other than that good quality and made in the USA!!!
1,WRONG.,"I ordered this cd expecting Hidden Place {video edit}, Verandi, and Generous PalmstrokeThe tracks found in this single/b-sides are the tracks in Hidden Place cd2. Not cd1.The tracks are:Hidden Place {acapella}Mother HeroicFoot Soldier"
5,Fresh Tracks from the 21st Annual Festival Artists,"A big hit every year, all seven previous editions have been top sellers! The San Francisco Jazz Festival CD Sampler contains fresh tracks of the best new Jazz from the top stars of the 21st Annual Festival: Keith Jarrett, Dave Holland, McCoy Tyner, Virginia Rodrigues, Bill Frisell, Marian McPartland, Maria Muldaur, Peter Cincotti, Kitty Margolis and more. It's a great way to explore what's new and hot in Jazz music, or to reconnect with your favorite artist from a recent performance."
4,works well,"The battery in my street rod is behind the back seat. This self contained timing light is a great design.Con: could be brighter, but is fine inside the garage. Not so good outside in bright sun.I started with Amazon in he 90s, books only. Now, I check prices there first on about all I buy. Prime is a great value!"
5,Really amazing!,"After reading ""Courtly Love"" which I enjoyed a lot I decided to read more by this author and started ""Defy The Eagle"". I love the Roman history and the time period has always intrigued me since it's not a tipical setting I've often chance upon in my reading.The story is really captivating and the historical research well done. I forgot what happened to the Iceni Queen Boadicea and so I was hoping with the Iceni to win the war against the Romans.I've loved all about this book.I spoiled myself before the read who Heall really was so that I knew what a major turn would have happened but this didn't ruin anything. At the end when Jilana and Caddaric met before her leave to Rome I cried and when Hadrian gave Jilana his gift I remembered what Clwyd once said to his son and knew what Jilana'd have done next.I really recommend this book. A great romance and an accurate descriptions of the events and customs of people of the past."
5,"Phillips, Craig and Dean","Love this Christian trio's music. I especially love this Christmas album. It was sent to me on time, good condition and plays very well."
3,Az-Mex Folk,I was not excited about this group after having watched this video...I expected more Mex than what is played. The radio play didn't give the full example of this group's abilities either. It was just OK for me.
4,very nice...moody.,a few of the tracks can go little long. great sound. love the fact that there are no lyrics.
3,Reminds me strongly of Popol Vuh...,"Anyone looking for another ""A Grand Love Story"" will be pretty bemused after listening to this. Nor is it anything like ""Kill Your Darlings"" either. In fact, now that I think about it, is there even a Kid Loco sound at all?Strange thing is, the longest piece on this CD sounds very much like some of Popol Vuh's longer excursions e.g. the title track from Bruder des Schattens etc. I'd love to know if KL has ever heard them. It's very hypnotic but its lack of development given its length may put a lot of people off."
3,It sould be a 3 1/2 stars,It's absortion rocks. It's size isn't so hot. And if you get the navy like me it sheds a little in the dryer onto your other clothes witch sucks. It's price is grt if u could use something of this size. Only wash and dry it with like colors or else it will shed or bleed onto other clothes more! It's feel is good but could be better. It's like a thin version of a super absorbant doubled sized washcloth. I like the calor alot. The bag is okay I guess. The loop is for easy hanging or attaching to certain types of bags.
1,too small to be useful,"This would be a great towel to use after shampooing, but it's too small to wrap around your head like a turban for even a minute. It just won't stay. The packaging was very impressive as shown but the towel is just too small."
4,nice to have if you have space,"Its way smaller than a normal towel and it actually dries you off really fast. I actually used one in Iraq, it was just less volume to pack than a conventional towel. Not sure if I would actually take it backpacking...I would most likely just dry off with a shirt or something and just hang it up."
2,Microfiber Towel,"Don't waste your money on this size. Go ahead and get the 19 x 39 towel. The absorbency is good but there's no way it will fit around a head. Also, I'm not sure what to do with the snap that is attached either."
5,Great read for young readers interested in a real life ballet story,"This book is an excellent book. Carolyn Meyer does a great job of portraying Marie's life, and joy for dancing. The characters really seem to come alive in this book. The book has many experiences in which could be related to real-life. This book would be an excellent read, especially for those who are interested in dance as an art form."
4,Perfect for a young lady!,"I purchased this book for my 11 year old daughter who is an avid reader. Her complaint was the ""French language was a bit difficult for her to understand and slowed her reading. She did enjoy the story and is passing the book around her class, so she obviously thought others would enjoy it as well. Great find for a young girl!"
2,disappointing!,"Ahmad tea mango had no taste of mango that I could discern. Very good black tea, but not what I expected. I cannot even smell a hint of mango. Very disappointing!"
5,the best tea out there,"I'm so glad I can find this tea over the Internet. Can't find it in the stores, and I love it!"
1,Absolutely horrible,It has a very artificial like taste. You can barely taste any mango. All you taste is a very poor quality tea with some artificial flavoring that make it the worst tasting tea I have ever had. Please do yourself a favor and don't even think about this tea.
3,Last Day in Limbo,"This book arrived in excellent condition. Even though I adore the author's books under the pen name Madeline Brent, I don't really enjoy the Modesty series. They are much more male fantasy oriented."
2,Immature Writing,"After downloading this book on my Kindle, I really wanted to enjoy it. But after one chapter, just sent it to my Delete file. I appreciate the effort it takes to be an author, just cannot stay with a book that has little writing skill."
5,Marinade,If you like Teriyaki you will love this. I have used it to marinade just about every kind of meat there is and it has a great flavor.
4,Excellent,"Cute, educational, and keeps kids interest. This was and educational series that was used as an insert between TV shows (similar to School House Rock). I just wish when they put them all together on DVD, they didn't play the show's ~intro~ and ~wrap up~ for every single song; that takes up a good bit of the run time (and gets annoying)."
2,Not the greatest wipres,"I bought a pair of 24"" & 16"" blades for my van (16"" for the rear) and they were fairly average. No matter how many times I adjusted, re-adjusted and switched them around the 24"" blades chattered and streaked within a month, while the 16"" just streaked. I went to Costco and bought Good Year bracketless wiper blades (changing them was easy) for the same price and I am very happy with them."
5,Best small office printer,"i love this printer so much that i order this one from amazon when the original failed after 4years of printing all my checks, and other print job for my accounting department. prints envelope, checks, and many other printer jobs. I print about 20pages a day. it's share they don't make this anymore. I bought used and broken ones from else where and replace the parts to make it work forver! lol"
3,Excessive lack of excess,"About as minimal as jazz, or any other genre for that matter gets, the beautifully bleak trio's concept disc stretches the notoriously slow group's lurching ambiguity even thinner. A majority of time almost feels like darkened tone poems instead of bona fide compositions, making the first and last tracks more memorable in between one heck of a hazy center. The sustained tension wears a little thin when there is hardly anything to support actual tension, but, especially a whole, the album still does not disappoint."
3,Smell,The smell does not fill a room like other scents available. I have to get within 3.5 feet to smell it.
1,Disappointed,I love the smell of sandalwood so I was looking forward to receiving this diffuser. There is almost no aroma in this product and I have a pretty sensitive smell. I would not buy this again.
2,no concrete example on How to Conduct This Attack,"the book when thru various attack topics, but no concrete example on how to conduct this attack (or example so trivial or infantile). or many ""how to conduct this attack"" are manual attack which probably requires various combination (who gonna do that?). no example on how can automate these attack.some of attack probably should be put in LOW priority cuz of MAX effort and LOW rate of success and result.the book is also poorly organized. should really do following1>specify how to conduct attack in points with example2>specify how to protect against attack in points"
4,Imaginext Pirate toys,"My six year old grandson loves the pirate ship he got for Christmas. We bought this pirate and others of the same series to supplement the two pirates that came with the pirate ship. The only disappointment has been that the pirates from these small sets do not fit on the foot pegs that are on the pirate ship. These pegs allow the pirates to stand erect while sword fighting, etc. However, he loves all of it and his two older brothers, ages 8 and 9, enjoy playing with him."
4,hidden gem,"This CD had a one hit wonder several years ago on the contemporary Christian stations called ""He Still Moves Stones"". The song was catchy and had some good lyrics, talking how Jesus Christ still moves those roadblock stones still today. I bought the CD and was captured by the beautiful song ""Write it on my Heart"", a beautiful Christian ballad. Brian Barrett since then sort of disappeared out of the music scene, leaving me wondering when his next album would be coming. He is definitely a talent with a little bit of a country twist on some of his songs. He has a beautiful voice and you will also probably like the song ""One Prayer"" a slower, but catchy, tune.I definitely recommend purchasing this little gem, while you can still find production copies, and you can get it low cost also. You may not think every song is a treasure, but there are sure to be a couple that you will definitely enjoy."
5,Good for learning,"This product has a lot of pieces in it to help your child count coins. They are very realistic and appropriate size. There are 50 coins of each type. There are pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters and even half dollars! They are very durable."
4,Hilarious give-and-take,"This CD is a fine introduction to some of the humor which permeated old time radio programs. The episodes tend to be quite predictable, but the ""bickering"" is full of biting humor and cynicism. It is not, however, something I would want to make a steady diet of."
5,a collaboration of voices celebrating service,"such a pleasure to read these stories... such an opportunity for all involved with the project to share their words...you never know, maybe someone was inspired to do something today...by simply reading...as long as Stone Soup for the World is available to America's youth we know we have a bright future ahead... My favorites: The Forgiveness Party, Table for 6 Billion Please, and Peace for Their Grandchildren....and there are 97 more to read and pass on...."
4,"Fun, Exciting, Entertaining","I purchased this item for my then 2 year old from a family video group. She loved it. Once you get pass the first part, which sets up the story, it is chock full of fun sing along songs. My daughter is nearing 4 now and still loves her ""Joanie video."" I catch myself singing along as well."
3,Generally clever and enjoyable,"My 3.5 year old really enjoys this video. It has a mix of new and familiar songs. The whole premise bothers me a little (an unfamiliar babysitter arrives at the home where 3 kids are wondering where there mom is), but if you can get past that and some other unsafe situations, the music and settings are clever and magical. I especially like Joanie because she does not sing down to the kids and her voice is pleasant, not simpy like some female children's entertainers. See her in person for an extra special treat."
3,adventurers tend not to be introspective,"disappointing. a short work. steve's life is presented in little more than outline depth. while atriculate on tv, doesn't transfer to the written page.one gets the impression this was written quickly. apparently afraid they're 15 minutes of fame will fade and trying to cash in while still can.what this subject needs is a third person to ask the in-depth questions that might give some real insight into this passionate environalist, biologist, risk-taker (his own attempts amount to repeated statements of how much he loves his mum)."
3,Later edition available,"Be careful when ordering this book, there is another in the Postmodern Encounters series which is basically the same book in a slightly more up-to-date format- Einstein and the Birth of Big Science. Same book, different title, with a couple more sentences..."
1,Not the same as picture,"The one in the picture shows what is called a lip guard, the one I got doesn't have one. I ordered it because of the lip guard. Also the manufacturer is different than what it stated. The one I got was by Ventlab."
2,Stiff cannula,"cannula was stiff and heavy, would have been very uncomfortable. I returned the lot of them. Would not purchase again."
1,DON' T BUY,I just received my second order of cannulas from this company and received totally different ones than what I got in my first order. As a matter of fact I received the same cannulas that my oxygen supply company uses. This was why I placed the order on Amazon because I don't like the cannulas that my oxygen supply company have. The ones I received in the first order were great they were a soft material that was easy on your nose had the lip guard that helps hold it in place. The ones I received today are a harder plastic material no lip guard and I have used them in the past and do not like. SO LIKE I SAID BEFORE DO NOT BUY you may get lucky the first time but obviously this is not a reputable company.
2,Streaks & Skips within 2 months,"While these wiper blades may be a good value, better to look for something different. Made the mistake of buying two sets, one car started skipping almost immediately after installation. The second car, within a couple of months."
2,Not the greatest wipers,"I bought a pair of 24"" & 16"" blades for my van (16"" for the rear) and they were fairly average. No matter how many times I adjusted, re-adjusted and switched them around the 24"" blades chattered and streaked within a month, while the 16"" just streaked. I went to Costco and bought Good Year bracketless wiper blades (changing them was easy) for the same price and I am very happy with them."
1,Configurator inaccurate,The website configurator said that these blames would fit my vehicle. They were way too narrow.I can't comment on the refill's quality. But I am giving one star because of my wasted time.
1,worse than the ones I was replacing,"I bought two pair of these wiper blades, two of them the 24 inch size. The other two smaller blades were ok, but the 24 inch size did nothing but streak the water across the windshield, they did not move the water away. Very odd. Threw them out and got plain rubber OEM replacement blades from the dealer."
2,Sizing not quite right,"Bought this as a replacement insert, but the 24"" size didn't quite fit my preexisting wiper. Beware of purchasing this based on 'recommended' sizing as this item was a little too short to fit appropriately. So not useful."
4,Works Well,"I purchased this product to use for my rear window. It's actually twice the size that I need, but it was easy to cut in half and slide into place. The wiper was worked quite well so far with no streaking."
3,A Realistic Picture of Gulf War from a Real Warrior,MAJOR Brooks Tucker paints a realistic picture ofwar uncluttered by sentimentality or Hollywoodhype. This is the story from a real MARINE who wasthere. His conclusion in the final paragraph ofthe book is eerily prophetic in the GWOT and ourcountry's aversion to paying the price forfreedom. If one wants a realistic picture ofMARINES at war then BREACH is for them.Michael L. Tomlinson
4,"Real Marines, Real History","Brooks Tucker has weaved an intricate story around the U.S. Marines' invasion of Kuwait in Operation Desert Storm. His detailed account places the reader smack dab in the middle of a Marine Infantry Platoon as it moves to evict Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. If you want to know what it was like to be a frontline ""grunt"" in 1991, you must read ""Breach."""
4,Great book!,"This book is incredible!!!!!! Everyone, especially girls in high school (or about to enter college) and their parents must read ""All Loves Excelling!"" It truly captures the essence of the false values which society places onto our youngsters. Amanda's tragic story is one which must not be repeated."
3,"Good message, poor writing","I really wanted to like this book, and at the end I did feel that the author conveyed a great message about parental pressure and the effect it has on children. My children attended private schools and I know that this kind of pressure is more common than not....but that it also occurs in ALL schools.Other reviewers have synopsized the plot, so I won't bother to repeat their efforts.Unfortunately, the writing style was a total turn off. It was oddly written, stiff, just plain strange. The plot was predictable and the characters were wooden. It is a shame that this was the case because it is sure to keep the book from being appealing to more people."
2,Important Message in a Mediocre Package,"Although Bunting's novel addresses a timely and important issue--the pressure for teens to get into the ""right college"" by packaging themselves (with the help of parents and various professionals) as what they think colleges want --I was very disappointed by the book as a whole.The characters are ludicrous stereotypes, the grammar is frequently flawed, the passages regarding Amanda's piano studies are unrealistic, and the plot was painfully predictable. The author was clearly motivated by the desire to illustrate an important message for his readers. The book is not, however, a work of literature."
4,"Starts slow, but goes out with a MAJOR bang...","First 9 songs are ok - I like most of Jacks' stuff. But nothing earth-shaking in that part of the set, as compared to the last 3rd.However, track 10 to 15 freaking ROCK OUT big time. Especially 12 & 13 - I think I'm on my 5th play in a row here...Anyway, I'd say this one is well worth the money - especially for the way it wraps up. Very energetic finish to a really enjoyable CD . Now to go see Jack live at Gruene Hall sometime!"
1,Stop in the name of taste!,I thought there was nothing else out there so I ate this Ener-G loaf for about a year. It was so awful and dry I was scared to eat alone because I was afraid I'd choke! But it was bread and toasted A LOT it was edible. Then I found French Meadow Spelt bread which is like manna for a yeast free sugar free diet. Don't waste your time with this Ener-G rice loaf.
4,Bibliophiles enjoy...,"Having just started a course in Rare Books and Manuscripts, I picked up this book on a whim and am happy to report that it is a great read for anyone interested in the goings-on of book dealers and collectors. This book is especially for anyone who takes interest in contemporary authors (the accounts of J.D. Salinger, Graham Greene, Salman Rushdie etc., are fascinating!). It's a book for people who are interested in the details of the book as an object itself -what makes an edition unique or valuable-, and might interest anyone who thinks they may have some old, valuable books sitting around in their basements. Gegoski is a skilled storyteller, it's one of the fastest reads I've done in a long time. I'd definitely read a second volume if he has any more stories to share in the future..."
1,Driver Problems,"Worked fine for about a year so it gets a star for that, and then there were all these problems with the drivers and the bundled software. The fixes have never been clear cut, and as a result I plan on staying away from HP scanning products. I dont know if there is a problem with the USB interface or what, but I saw numerous posts on various sites expressing the same problem, and there was never a cut a dried answer."
5,A Great Toy,"My son got this gift for Christmas from his aunt. She does daycare and has a pretty good idea of what toys kids might like, so we were hoping he would have fun with the learning table. The minute we set it up he got excited and started hitting all the buttons. Until then he hadn't stood on his own or balanced on his feet too much. The table has helped him with that and also helped him with sitting up. It is a toy that more than one baby can play on at a time too. I definitely recommend the Laugh & Learn learning table."
4,Son loves it-Dangerous?,"7mo loves his table, he plays in sit up position but lately he loses his balance and takes the table down with him, landing on top of him. He's tough, he just lets out a noise and I rescue. Maybe the table should be heavier?"
3,Great toy but tips over easily- Watch out!,"The legs of this table do not have feet on them like other tables (Leap Frog's, for example), so it seems to be easy to knock down. I bought this table for my 10 month old son after he began pulling up to a standing position. At first every time he pulled up on the table it toppled over. He would fall backwards with the table on top of him, hitting his head on the floor. He has learned to be careful with it, and now (1 month later) he never knocks it over. He loves the spoon shaped rattle and the peek-a-boo napkin. He giggles at the salt and pepper when they say ""ah-choo, excuse me"", and plays with the apple and soup bowl a lot. I'm not sure it is teaching him anything, but it's fun. Buy this toy, but stay very close by when your child is playing with it!"
3,"Great concept, but too short....","I purchased this table for my son because I liked the toys on it better than some of the other tables offered. However, when I set it up for him to play with, it was so low to the ground that he could only use it if he was sitting in my lap (instead of standing, which is why I wanted it). He's only 9 months old, so it's not that he is too old to use it. Also, it's not sturdy enough for him to pull himself up - it would just fall over on him.I do like the toys and the legs come off so that he can sit on the floor and play with it. He really enjoys it, but I'm returning it for the LeapFrog table, which is a little higher and will work for what I wanted it for - to help him pull up and stand on his own....."
1,Big waste of money !,My son recieved this as a present for his 1 st birthday. He did play with it a alot that day but not since. This toy just sucks the batteries down! I really don't think it is very fun at all and the buttons stick on it also.
1,Don't buy this table..,"I was at my firend's house for an hour and see her 9 month daughter tip over twice.. very very dangerous table....My self had the older vesion fisher price learning table, which has 3 legs instead of 4 legs.. it is so mucy better, my 11 month boy just loves it so much, I do not understand and not sure why Fisher Price would retire the so much better previous version table and replace with this such unsafe table...I think the leapfrog is better choice now.. I got my older version fisher-price learning table at Cocto for $22..that's why I did not buy the leap frog table..."
2,don't buy this product....unsafe,"My daughter recieved this as a Christmas present. She likes to play with it but it is limited on what it does. My biggest concern is it is not very stable. My daughter is 1 and she is just learning how to walk by holding on to things. She has fallen over it trying to get to something on the other side, or she has leaned on it and it has fallen over. She got a nasty bruise on her head from the leg after she leaned on it to hard and it fell over and bumped her head. I had to take the legs off so she could play with it without hurting herself"
5,Fantastic table - going strong on second child,"Obviously, do not pay $200 for this table, but if you can find it for the $20-30 mark, it is a terrific toy. We bought it for my first child when she was about 10 months old, and she is still interested in it as a 3 year old. Her younger brother loves it also. Before he started pulling up, I took the legs off and it was a great floor toy. Now that he can pull to stand, he is mesmerized, and is spending a lot of time exploring the features. It does sing and make a lot of noise (I have it on the lower volume setting, found on the underside of the table top), but I don't find it as annoying as many other battery powered toys. I like the dual content feature - one option for singing and music, and another option for ""learning"" that goes through the alphabet, colors, shapes, and so on. This is a table with a long shelf life, since it holds the attention of both a 5 month old, and a 3 year old, and has held up to more than two years of play in my house."
5,Cute Table,"I purchased this toy for my daughter's first birthday/christmas and read the reviews of the alphabet song getting stuck on ""P"". I had the same problem until I turned the table over and pulled the tab that was for use as a demo. Once you take the tab out, it plays the entire alphabet song. I like this table much better than the leapfrog table. My four year old son agrees, too. The leapfrog table to me is kind of annoying with the lady's voice. The Laugh & Learn table is more cheerful and cutesy. It teaches ABCs, numbers, colors, manners, etc. I also have the learning home for her, too. I know her big brother will be showing her how to play with all these items."
2,WARNING!!!!,"This toy is DANGEROUS!!!!!! My daughter got it when she was 10 months old and immediately tried to pull up on it and pulled it over on top of herself. It landed on her face. She loves it so I continue to let her use it while guarding her very closely. She also cut her lip on it during another fall, which I guess really could happen with anything that she pulled herself up on but the base isn't strong enough to keep them from pulling it over on herself. She will continue to use it but only when I am right next to her until she is more stable standing up."
1,BEWARE....READ ALL REVIEWS AND NO ONE MENTIONED THIS....,MY 11 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER WAS DELIGHTED WITH THIS TOY...THEN ALL OF THE SUDDEN I HEARD HER CRYING AND LOOKED OVER FROM THE COMPUTER TO SEE HER HEAD CAUGHT IN THE LEGS...I AM ASSUMING THAT SHE DROPPED THE SPOON (THAT SHOULD BE ATTATCHED!!!) AND REACHED UNDER TO PICK IT UP...I AM RETURNING IT IMMEDIATLY AND PURCHASING THE LEAP FROG AT COSCO FOR LESS...
1,">>> Alphabet Soup Song Stops at ""P"" !! <<<","I compared the Leapfrog table with this one. Both are quite cute, but the Alphabet Soup Bowl in the center of this one was notable for it's creativity in design and blatant flaw. The ""ABC"" song gets to ""P"" and then finishes with a tune. I tried 6 of these in two different stores."
4,It's nice that the volume is low,I think this is the first toy I've seen that the sound is not so loud you want to hide the toy. I bought this for my 9.5 month old and she loves it. She mainly bangs on it and uses it to stand up.
5,Wonderful table,"I bought this table for my daughter around 8 months. She loves it! This table is appropriate for younger babies, since the legs are easily removable and can sit on the floor. For my daughter, she'll spend 20 minutes playing with just this toy. It is the first thing she crawls to during playtime. It has made her standing more stable and she gets ready to walk!"
4,my son loves this table,"My sons father purchased this toy as a xmas gift. At the time, my son was 9 months old. As I took it out the box he immediately wanted to play. This product is VERY easy to assemble (you only need to snap the legs into the bottom).My only concern was not being able to have this table on wood floors. At 10 and a half months, my son would push it across the room as if it were a walker toy. He really couldn't walk good at the time but he'd push & try to keep up. It was a bit dangerous. I decided to use his circular basketball rug and put the table on it. Now he can't push it. I would advise anyone to keep this table on carpet. it's kind of dangerous to have on regular flooring.Other than that, it's a great product. My son is now 13 months and he still plays with it. He loves the many options it has. it really keeps him occupied longer than most toys."
5,My daughter LOVES this table!!,"My baby, Olivia (10 months old,) LOVES LOVES LOVES this table. She holds on to the bowl and walks around the table in circles. She dances and bounces to the music. She gravitates towards it no matter what room it's in. She loves the spoon too. When we put the spoon in the bowl, she grabs it immediately and throws it to the ground. It's hilarous! This toy is great for babies learning to stand. She has managed to knock it over a couple of times, but come on, every toy does that unless you nail it into the floor! My only gripe...the cup doesn't work very well. It's supposed to magically fill itself up when the baby pushes down on it. It gets stuck most of the time, but doesn't take away from the toy's value in our home!"
3,"Easy to TIP over, otherwise good.","I'm really surprised a previous reviewer said it doesn't tip over. My 9 mo old daughter can tip it over easily when she tries to pull up on it. In fact, my husband or I have to sit on the other side of it and hold it so it doesn't tip. The ""table"" part is heavy and if it hits my daughter, it wouldn't be pretty.Just look at the legs- they go straight down whereas the leap frog table's legs bulge out for more balance and stability. That's my big complaint- otherwise it's fun and colorful."
5,Loves It!,My 9 month old loves how interactive it is. He especially likes being able to stand and play with it.
3,My Son has only had this 4 days loves it but.......,"My son is 9 1/2 months old and weighs 18 lbs. Love this it makes him giggle, laugh and dance. But for some reason I don't know how, he can lift it a little and its almost fallen on his face and nocks hime over.. 3 times and he has only had it for 4 days. I'm not sure what to do, but I think its dangerous. Santa is bringing him the Learning home. I think I will see what happens then. But this toy might get taken back to the store it came from because I don't want to make any trips to the ER because of it. I would try to weigh it down but no clue how.."
2,Defective- check the alphabet before buying,"Before you buy, check that the toy sings the whole alphabet. The one we recieved as a gift, as well as every single unit at Wal-Mart and Target only go up to the letter ""p"" and stops. There is at least one other person in the review with the same complaint. We are unable to find a store that carries this toy with a complete alphabet. Buyer be warned!"
2,"Disappointment, hazardous when legs are installed","My 10-mo-old son showed no particular interest in this ""table"". I did not like it much either. Why would a 10-mo-old show any interest in table items that sing? I have left it without legs. Two minutes after I installed the legs my son nearly fell with the ""table"" on his face. Had to uninstall them. Not good for active infants. Also not very entertaining. Buy the one from Leapfrog but still be careful when you have installed the legs because they say that that one is higher than this (might have more balance though but I do not know for sure)."
2,"Misleading Title -- All About Animals, Drugs, Foods, etc.","The title to this book is truly misleading. All the book talks about are physical things (as opposed to ideas or thoughts) from Central Asia that were documented to have appeared in Tang China. The author has some interesting findings (on pronunciations and etymology, but the rest of the book is disappointing. Each of the 18 chapters is titled by one physical item (Men, Animals - domestic and wild, Birds, Furs, plants, woods, foods, aromatics, drugs, textiles, pirgments, minerals, jewels, metals, secular objects, sacred objects). The author basically did a search through a database of Tang Chinese writings and noted all the imports that fitted into the 18 categories. Not worth it."
3,A decent collector's item...,"and as the only full-length live release from their original lifespan, the album virtually recommends itself. However, it should be noted that Julianne's vocal performance is inconsistent - she seems out-of-breath, missing a lot of notes.Apart from a very atmospheric mix with plenty of audience response, the main points of interest are the alternate versions of less-familiar second-album tracks (`Road...' and `Only One Reason' turn out best) and favorite b-sides (though `Paradise' is the 1989 arrangement, requiring a backing tape).The highlight though is the set-closer - not only is this version of `In The Meadow' a chorus or two longer than usual, it's the most explosively energetic take on any official release - with the rhythm section finally letting off steam after all those slow songs, Tim puts a lot more effort into the solo than on either the `album' or `b-side' versions. Recommended for this track alone."
5,Serana the monitor,This monitor roxs i just bought it the next day and it rocked my socks of i love this please buy it.I'll be your best friend.;)
3,These suckers are TIGHT!,"Had I known then what I know now, I would have ordered a half size up from what I usually wear. These shoes are on the ""really tight"" side of tight. The heels are pretty high, too, for those who care. I'll wear anything -- and I'm sure my back and leg muscles will hate me for it someday."
1,si...pero no!!!,"La Copla se canta con orquesta pero no con sinfónica,porque suena rara sin pellizco como se dice en Andalucia...La Pantoja demuestra que el paso del tiempo la afecta y mucho,la voz suena con un vibrato feo y desafinada,cantando un repertorio clásico en el mundo de la copla pero ninguna la canta mejor que todas las maestras que en su dia las cantaron como Lola Flores,La Piquer,Juanita Reina...una pena pero es asi."
1,no,"i guess i got confuse on my order, cause i dont reconized noteven one song, i have to say she is a great artist, i justnot familiarized with this kind of music or performance."
5,Excellent in every respect,Extraordinary performance...but you can get it for a LOT cheaper through the Berkshire Record Outlet ([...])
2,Cheaply Made,"This TV cost me $320.00. The picture is OK, but the sound is definitely low quality. I had to really turn up the bass on it to get it to quit sounding so thin and cheap. When I hooked the audio outputs into my stereo system, I had to turn the bass all the way up on my stereo amp and the treble all the way down just to have an adequate amount of bass to enjoy hearing music on it. This TV is the quality that I expect to see in a motel room, but not what I am willing to live with for the next decade or two.The worst part is that when you are running the sound through the stereo, the TV volume control only controls the TV, not the sound that you are running through the stereo. If you need to turn it up or down you have to walk over to the stereo and do it manually.Today I am returning this TV to the store where I bought it."
2,Audio Problem,The audio quality was horrible. It went from too soft to too loud to muffled. I returned it. I don't recommend this product.
1,"Snapped off, MIM junk.","Was rotating my tires and started with this adapter attached to an 18"" breaker bar. The adapted snapped right in half. Looks like MIM parts based on the texture of the break. Going to look for an actual forged piece from the 1950's or 1960's on eBay. The tire iron I eventually used did not break..."
3,Okay mix,"This mix CD was just okay for me. The first track is a mix of all the tunes used on the CD, which is a waste of space, and the tunes used were more house flava than the ol' skool I was looking for."
5,Works great!,"This PCMCIA card works as advertised and at a bargain basement price! No problems and easy installation. Great security, too."
5,Great book,"This is a great introduction to three major labor upheavals in US history. Dana Frank's chapter, ""Girl Strikers Occupy Chain Store, Win Big"" is a particularly relevant story of working people vs. powerful corporation. The whole book is pretty short - just 173 pages and each chapter moves quickly."
3,Not a bad book,Not really the sort of book you would pick up and read for fun but a good easy read with good points. a great book for classes.
5,so very tastefull,"I got this cd to learn a song that was to be sung at a funeral. This could be one played at a service in it's entirety and someone would be touched deeply by any or all of the songs. Have not been a Porter Wagoner fan, but like me, you will enjoy every song, his voice is clear and on pitch, and you can readily hear the reverence in his performance."
5,So very handy...,"My husband and I rely greatly on our thermapen and laser gun thermometer to ensure proper temps, but always had to pull out cookbooks to determine safe temperatures. This is now on our fridge and saves us so much time. We love it!"
2,Looks like it cleans... but...,"Our Orek died and we needed a vacuum so with limited choices at the store, we went with this model. The dirt collects in the bin and that is great. What concerned me is the dirt that was spitting out the back. We have hard wood floors and I would get pelted in the legs with dirt particles that would escape the beaters and fly out the back. Maybe others don't realize this because they are on carpet, either way, I wouldn't want that."
4,No more dog hair,"This product is the king of all Vacuums... with it's extra wide (15 inch) brush you can quickly cover any large room. It's collection area is nearly 3 times the size of my last vacuum's and so far, it hasn't lost any suction (and with the bestialiness of it, I don't see how it could).With it's small brush attachment, it'll clear a sofa of dog hair in minutes.The only issue I have with it is that, even with recently upgraded power throughout my apartment, this thing sucks so much juice that I have to turn off all other electronics... including my air conditioner, otherwise the fuse blows. Hard to vacuum in the dark... I'm sure more modern/more circuits would reduce/eliminate this problem, but it definitely is a problem for me..."
4,Bissell Momentum 3910,"As of this writing, there have been 105 reviews on this product. here is my two cents after shopping for a vacuum; if tilting of the unit is an issue, just be aware of it and use it accordingly; if the rollerbar doesn't stop on the ""bare floor"" setting, continue anyway i doubt it will damage your floor unless you have wood from Borneo and it's an exotic wood costing ""1 million dollars"" which if it is, you wouldn't be looking at this review. if you complained about changing the dirct cup so often while vacuuming, the vacuum may not be the problem, use it more often or be neater. If you complained about no retractable cord, who cares? All in all, the unit is great for the money. easy to assemble (2 screws and a few snap on pieces). Gosh for $55 delivered to my door as a new open box item, i'll dance with it everytime i whip it for a ride. BTW, i have two cats and my black carpet looks great!"
1,Garbage,We bought this vacuum one year and two days ago. It has a one year warantee. It quit today. The beater brush is such a cheap assembly that it literally melted to the housing. It's design was something a 10 year old would have been ashamed of.
1,Bissell Cyclonic *nitemare*,"Don't waste your time or money on this vacuum..I bought this with high hopes and all I got is a pain everytime I used this vacuum..It's so top heavy it falls over all the time, it has no suction, it never had a good suction..The burning smell it had when I turned it on never did go away..I finally gave up and bought a new vacuum..I bought a ""Hoover WindTunnel Self Propelled"" not bagless..It's wonderful..."
2,Help! Shoots dirt & debris out the back side of the unit,"i was ready to pack this baby up & send it back, but after ready all the excellent reviews, i have to ask: what am i doing wrong. it seems to collect quite a bit of dirt & pet hair, but continually shoots dirt & debris out the back of the unit as if it is not strong enough to pick it up. i have cleaned all filters, checked for clogs and emptied the container. any thoughts?"
2,"Dust gets out around seams, etc.","What started as a small problem has gotten worse over time. The vacuum has great suction and pulls up a lot of dust and dog hair. HOwever, the seal around the bagless canister has gotten ""weaker"" and fine dust comes out. Also, the HEPA filter is not seated as well as it should be and dust gets out around the edges of it. So please be aware of this problem if you choose to buy this vacuum. If I had it to do all over again, I would spend $40 more and get a Hoover, most likely."
1,Received a defect broken product,"I purchased this product based on the great review here. I received the shipment yesterday and suspected it's not a brand new one immediately because the box seal was partially open. I confirmed my suspicion. Before I even begin the step one assembly, I found the plastic broken on one side of the location where to slide the handle. It is obvious someone tried to assemble and broke it before. I was surprise the plastic is so weak and design so poorly. I'm very disappointed for receiving a return product. I'm returning to amazon for refund and do not want to exchange the same product again. I never had a chance to try this product. Therefore, this review is not based on function review, but defect product received.Billy"
3,Review of Bissell Momentum,"I was a little dissappointed. Really heavy.I like the red/green switch, though."
5,Amazing vacuum,"I was searching for a new vacuum for several months, and came across this one, read ALL the reviews and thought I'd take a chance...it sounded too good to be true. When I received it, it was just amazing. It is truly the best vacuum I have ever owned. The suction power is great. My kids and I had so much fun with it (because it worked so well), we vacuumed the whole house, including the furniture, fans, etc. the first day. I would recommend this vacuum to anyone that wants a great one!"
5,Fantastic Buy,"This vacuum is wonderful! Contrary to some people's reviews this is extraordinarily easy to put together. My wife got it and put it together in under 10 minutes. It's so easy to dump out the dirt cup and makes no mess. We used our old vacuum right before we tried this one out and it got up so much more dog hair. I would recomend this to anyone for ease of use, cord length, overall performance and value."
2,"After 3 month's use, a disappointment","I've owned this vacuum for a year.I have a german shepherd who sheds constantly, a long haired cat, and I live in the country in an area with a lot of fine dusty dirt.I was extremely pleased with its cleaning power initially, but am ultimately very disappointed in it. It tends to clog constantly, spit back dirt on hard floors, and steadily lost suction. I cleaned the filters after each use -- the problem really seems to be one of poor manufacturing quality.After 6 months of weekly use it performed poorly. After 9 months the motor began shrieking like a dyspeptic banshee (it's not the belt). The vacuum finally gave up the ghost and I can buy a new one in good conscience.Not that I think anything else will do much better or last much longer. I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews before I bought this one.Bissell 3910 Momentum Bagless Upright Vacuum Cleaner"
4,I am very impressed,"I just bought this vacuum today and I am beyond impressed! For sake of being repetitive, I'll just say that the vacuum does everything people wrote but better than I ever expected. Cleaned my 1100 sq. foot apartment and dumped 5 cups and I am a every-other-day vacuum-er! My last vacuum was the worst and I knew it. The best part is that I was about to buy a Dyson and I can't imagine it being any better than this Bissell. The 4 stars are only because I have only had the vacuum for 1 day, but so far so good!"
2,Does not work after 1 year,"When we first bought this vacuum, it worked great and I was very pleased with it. After having it for about a year, it no longer picks up everything. It does alright with things like cracker crumbs. But you can forget it picking up pieces of string or sock fuss. My carpet usually looks about just as dirty after I finish vacuuming, and I have to go around by hand and pick the rest up. I can't wait until we can afford to replace it."
4,Good but not sure whether the best on the market,I had this for more than 2 years. It does its job. Only downside I see is bit heavier to move around.
1,This vacuum is crap!,"I am not a complainer, but I can't say enough bad things about this vacuum. I read the many positive reviews and bought one without hesitation. What a waste of money! Hope you don't make the same mistake I did! Cheaply made - always clogs - dust gets all over it - plastic hose holder broke off. We just threw it out. We are going to buy an electrolux. You really do get what you pay for!"
1,Very Disappointed,At first the vacuum worked wonderfully. After a couple months the hose collapsed and needed to be repaired. Then dirt got into the motor and causes it to make a terribly loud noise (so bad that I put the dogs outside when I vacuum to spare their ears). Debris gets caught in the vacuum and dirt flies everywhere. In less than 6 months the vacuum becme basically unusable.
5,Bissell Vacuum Cleaner,I bought this vacuum cleaner as a Christmas present for my son. My son loves it! He said he couldn't believe what ended up in the vacuum cup when he vacuumed his apartment. No complaints at all.
2,TERRIBLE if you have pets,I bought this because of its price and long cord. It worked well at first but now needs a complete take apart every time I use it because it clogs so easily. It cannot handle the animal hair in my house and was a total waste of money.
2,Bought b/c of reviews and was disappointed,"I guess my crazy life was just too much for this vacuum. Still clogged every other week and I got used to grabbing my screwdriver and taking it apart. I now have the Dyson Animal and it is amazing. Believe the hype. Nothing else can live up to it and believe me, I've tried."
5,great vacum,This ones a keeper. Works well glad I read other reviews before I bought it. Its easy to use and no problem with the delivery from amazon. You will be pleased with the dirt this vacum gets up.I would tell all this one is great!
5,Good Vaccuum,Our old dirt devil quit on us and we got this vaccuum. I could not believe the dirt it picked up. For the price it worked really well! I am so happy with this vaccuum and already feel like my house is cleaner.
4,Good buy,"Nice vacuum. Cleans well and has good power. Super easy to use/empty container. Can't really speak to longevity since I've only used it a couple times, but so far I'm impressed and glad I purchased it."
4,Good vacumn for the money,"We purchased this item as a replacement for a $ 400.00 Dyson unit that my wife was not happy with. This vacumn works great , and at about $ 100 w/ shipping , it was a total bargain.Thanks"
5,Great Sucking Machine,"I ordered this for my daughter whose old one was dying. I put it together for her at my house and tested it on the living room floor. It was amazing what this pulled out of our carpet that our current vacuum did not. Also, I had just used a steam cleaner on the living room a few days earlier. Don't know how this will hold up over the long term, because we just got it (I don't have a reason to suspect that it won't), but I was very impressed with the first five minutes of use. Nice price for a real good sucker. I think I will soon order one for myself."
4,A good value and decent vacuum,"This vacuum has good power, excellent suction and does a good job of getting my carpets clean. The hose is plenty long to reach up half a flight of stairs. The hose and attachments store well on the base unit. I'm really pleased with this item - the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it tends to fall over backward fairly easily. As long as you don't pull on the hose to the back when you are vacuuming, it's fine.Also, make sure you empty the cannister before it gets too full. I have 3 dogs and I have accidentally completely clogged this vacuum up more than a few times. Once it is all cleaned out, though, (a process which can take 15 or 20 minutes if I've really overdone it) it works like a charm again. All things considered, this is a trooper of a vacuum."
4,Works well,"This vacuum works very well, it is easy to assemble and use. Cleaning it is also very easy. It will clog up with pet hair but once you find the 4-5 places it likes to clog it is very easy to unclog (look behind the filters). It picks up an amazing amount of pet hair compared to any other vacuum I have owned. It also decreases dust and allergens as advertised."
3,good initial investment,"As a new product this works very well.The hose could have been longer, and the vac tends to fall down with slight pressure towards the back---something wrong with the balance I suppose.The curved shape of the hose end-piece makes it difficult to fit it to the vacuum slot.Nevertheless, suction is impressive. I have been using it for a short time and do not know how well it will stand regular wear and tear."
3,vaccuum cleaner,THE VACUUM CLEANER IS GOOD BUT IT DRAWS ALOT OF DUST ON THE MACHINE. ALSO IT WILL SHOCK THE HECK OUT OF YOU IF YOU DON'T DISCONNECT IT BEFORE YOU CLEAN OUT THE TUB. IT'S STILL TOO HEAVY FOR MY WIFE TO USE. WE'RE IN OUR LATE 70'S AND IT'S EVEN DIFFICULT FOR ME TO USE.
5,"Love, love ,love this machine","I wish I had purchased this long before now. The suction on it is super. I can't tell you how dirty I feel after cleaning my carpets. Ugh!! I knew my other cleaner wasn't up to par, but this is a real eye opener. I can't believe how much deep embeded dirt I'm picking up. I also have an indoor dog and 2 cats. Need I say more! The price is very good. I can't find anything I don't like about the cleaner. Very good buy."
5,This vacuum rocks,Everyone should have one of these! Only downside is the hose isn't long enough...but still a must have.
4,Smells.... clean!!!,"We have two cats. So, like you, I read the reviews.I said, ""ok, what have I got to lose?"" I ordered, and as usual Amazon is fast, dependable and keeps UPS busy!!! I got it yesterday.The ONLY reason I would not give this a raving 5 stars... is because the extender hose takes some getting used to, slipping it back through the hole and onto the base. I am constantly pulling it out for various tasks, and it is just a little difficult to twist back on.But overall, when I emptied that dust cup.... even the powdered carpet cleaner that I hadn't used in a long while was in there. 2 thumbs UP!!!"
1,Do not buy. Not even used,"I'm with the other negative reviewers here. This vacuum, uh... sucks. After about 13 months, it got very loud, and stopped picking up dirt altogether shortly thereafter. Have always kept ours clean, filters changed, emptied the collection container after every run through the house and made sure all the suction spots were well clear of any obstructions. Don't waste your time on this. Broke right after the warranty was up. Go figure."
1,Worthless,"I purchased this item based on other reviews. When I first bought it I still had three months before I would be able to test it out to make sure I liked it...wrong move, now I cant return it. I have hardwood floors with area rugs, but my two bedrooms have carpet. When I actually got to use it the first time went ok, after that it went down hill. When I use it on my area rugs I can feel the thing spit the dirt right back out the back at my legs and onto my wood floor, which in turn I have to try to vacuum again but usually end up having to sweep the carpet and then my floors again. If Amazon would let me return I would..."
3,Good Enough,The Vacuum cleans well enough....My problem is in the noise level....Very Very Noisey ....needs a muffler & retractable cord....otherwise the price is right & does the job
1,HAD TO RETRACT THE 5 STAR AND DROP IT TO ONE,AS I DID I REVIEWED THIS WAY TO FAST HENCE THE ORGINAL 5 STARS BEING RETRACTED AND GOING RIGHT DOWN TO ONE STAR.I AM SURE IF PEOPLE WOULD RE-LOOK AT WHAT'S IN THE BIN ITS CARPET FIBERS MOSTLY MIXED WITH DUSK. I posted an orginal review after just trying it out in my bedroom and had to retract it after doing a total vacuuming in my house. OMG yes it sure picked up everything including the carpet fibers. The height bottom does not work hence this happening. It's going back and I'm off to Sear's for a Kenmore. If you love your carpet you will not have it for long. I would think this would be great on a burber and thats it. Figures I would be one to agree with the other 1 and 2 stars.
5,Worth the cost.,"Got this as a birthday present. As I was out of town a friend got it and put it together. She said it was easy and took just a few minutes.Cleans great, easy to use, and seems quiter than others I've heard. I'd recommend this to anyone looking to buy an upright bagless."
5,Great Vacuum! Great Price!,"I received my Bissel about two weeks ago. I used it as soon as I put it together, and immediately I was a happy camper. I have two dogs plus one eight year old in the house who need tidying up after quite often. The Bissel really did a wonderful job. My carpet felt clean when I was finished. The cord is long enough where I can clean the whole downstairs without having to unplug and replug elsewere. The canister is very easy to remove, however, dumping dust is dumping dust. It is just as messy as my old Eureka. However, the good way outweighs the not so good. If you are in need of a new vacuum, this one is great and the price is reasonable.** When I purchased my Bissel a year ago it was less than $100. It is still a wonderful vacuum and has held up well. I have indoor doggies and use my Bissel at least 3 times a week. However, the price listed now might make me reconsider shopping with Amazon. I would check Walmart, Lowes, or Home Depot for pricing first."
4,Best vacuum I have owned,I have 2 young children and 3 small dogs-they all make messes. I have owned a Kirby now for 10 years and for the price we paid for that we thought it was top of the the line and doing the job....WRONG! The Bissell went right to work when it got here and we could not believe the dirt and dog hair it picked up-mind you we had just vacuumed with the Kirby! We felt like we lived outside on the ground. We love this machine especially for the price! My only complaint is that it is a bit top heavy but for the suction power it has we will take the top heavy part and run with it.
2,No so great,"Have had this vacuum a while and although it is easy to use and the bagless cup makes it easy to empty the dirt it does NOT do a good job. I have to go over places on my carpeting and area rugs numerous times especially if there is a higher pile. I have a long hair cat and it takes many, many runs to pick up the hair. Most of the time it turns the cat hair into balls and I hand pick it up. If you want an average-OK vacuum that is inexpensive then buy this one. If you want to spend a bit more for a better vacuuming experience I would look else where. Bottom line - do your research."
3,"Good for hair, but nothing else...","This is great at getting pet hair but anything else....be prepared to get hit in the feet by crumbs and cat litter! Very frustrating! I have wood floor and carpet. Works fine on the carpet but when I do the wood floors everything gets shot back at me. Like I said, picks up hair fine but crumbs and things like that....nope! Totally bummer!"
2,Brush Failure,"Have been pleased with performance of this vacuum. Works good on pet hair.However, just had SECOND brush failure in 6 months. First failure happned within a week of purchasing. Have now suffered second brush failure. This in addition to a belt failure has made this vacuum a frustrating itme."
4,This sucks! =),"We still have this vacuum, purchased at least 4 years ago. It still works great!!! I'm always amazed when I empty the container how much dust and dirt the vacuum picks up!"
3,Not the greatest...,"This vacuum works pretty well, I suppose, but the design is just not very user friendly. One of the most frustrating parts about this vacuum is the ""hammer-head"" shaped head on the machine. It's nice that's it has a very wide cleaning head, but the head extends about an inch and a half beyond the body of the vacuum on either side. What this means is that it gets caught on every single piece of furniture in the room. After vacuuming 5 or 6 rooms, I'm ready to throw it out the window."
3,Does the job,"It vacuums. It works pretty well. Nothing spectacular. I do like the attachments, they work okay."
5,So far so good,"I've owned this product for a few months with no complaints. I love the power paw attachment, i can tell a noticeable difference, It works like a mini vaccuum. Very good suction power i'm always surprised to see how much is in the dirt cup. Good product, would recommend."
4,Great vacuum,Works great.I was surprized at all the dirt my old vacuum left behind.Good vacuum for the money!
4,Bissell vacuum cleaner,Very satisfied w/ performance of vacuum cleaner. Picks up great! I was amazed at the amount of dirt picked up.
3,"LOVE, PHILOSOPHICALLY SPEAKING","Robert C. SolomonLove: Emotion, Myth, & Metaphor(Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1981) 347 pagesAn entertaining book by a philosopher familiar with the historyof love and contemporary attempts to understand it scientifically.Solomon takes some of the same points of view as found inNew Ways of Loving by James Park,but he does not work them out as systematically."
3,Thought Provoking,"At the time I'm writing this, the author's first name in the Amazon listing does not match the spelling on the novel cover. And don't be confused by the ""Five Star"" publisher references all over the title (at the time I'm writing this, again); the title isWorld-Walker.In this novel by Melisa Michaels, those who travel among worlds risk bumping their counterparts and causing chaos and the thinning of the barriers between worlds. I loved the mysteries and the things that made me think. The premise makes a good basis for exploring notions of fate and history. However, some aspects of the big picture seemed to go off into strange directions and some of the time I could not understand why the characters did what they did; perhaps this was some minor preaching by the author and I just didn't get it."
3,Anxiety about second-wave feminism,"The invention of Vita-Lerp, a drug that not only allows parthenogenesis, but gives great orgasms as well, makes men superflous and sparks a movement to eliminate men altogether. Captain Benjamin Franklin Hansen of the US Navy finds himself promoted into the highest ranks of government as the men make plans to stop the women's crusade. Hansen must choose whether to put his faith in the loyalty of his beloved wife Helga and daughter Joan Paula, or to side with the High Command, who is so intent on victory that they would even consider nuking the United States.I wasn't sure until the very end which way things would go; I liked that aspect. The male characters were sexist and lecherous enough to be despicable; the females were inscrutable or stereotypical. Very 70s."
5,Vividly and with intensity about the Korean War,"Shinn's book tells it like it was in the fighting for Seoul, the anxieties at the Pusan Perimeter, the Inchon landing (the startegic masterstroke by General Douglas MacArthur which turned out to be a Shinn 'scoop'), and the communist duplicity in negotiations at Panmunjom. No amount of research can recreate the good, the bad and the ugly of wars like the Korean War. This man Shinn was there and has written about it vividly and with intensity."" Ed Nellan, a Tokyo-based columnist"
2,Disappointing results,"The Whitestrips didn't work nearly as well as I had hoped. I wasn't expecting glistening white teeth like the models in their commercials, but a noticeable improvement would have been nice.They weren't difficult to apply, but I did not like the way the strips tasted. I ended up trying to hold my tongue out of the way when they were in my mouth (not easy to do for 1/2 hour straight!). I also agree with a number of other reviewers in that there was a lot of waste, especially considering the strips don't cover all my teeth that show.Bottom line was that I bought them to whiten my teeth and if they did that, I could have put up with the bad taste and lack of full coverage. But they didn't. I would not use these again."
3,"Ummm, These Hurt","But they do whiten. A little. As most of the reviews seem to say, you're not going to get super-ultra white teeth. However, if you have stains from coffee, smoking, wine, ect., these help a lot. My teeth were looking pretty dull, and now they look 100% better. They are not virgin snow white though- for that you'll have to visit the dentist. But worth the money. Do be prepared for sensitivity...I actually quit using the bottom strips because they were causing a lot of pain. Plus, the bottom ones don't stay on very well anyway, so it's probably not a big loss."
1,Is not worth the money!,"My teeth were not too far from white to begin with, but there was some yellowing from drinking coffee and red wine. The strips did not stay on very well at all - they felt uncomfortable, loose around teeth and I would try not to swallow so as not to put the chemicals into my body, but then the strips would get puffy with saliva! And also, they really hurt my gums and made my teeth super sensitive. My teeth saw no noticeable difference, and I completed the 7 day regiment. I have found some toothpaste that works extremely well, I saw an improvement in only a couple of days: Rembrandt Intense Stain Removal. It has whitened my teeth a lot, more than I expected really. I'd try the $6 toothpast before the $35 strips if I were you!"
1,What's The Point?,"Besides the fact that the strips don't stay in place, they don't cover all of the teeth that show in my smile either top or bottom."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"First of all, after 7 days (really only 6 cause one set of strips were wasted) there was some white 'spots' on my teeth and if you look closely...they look very strange. Now I need to go and get another product or see a dentist. Second, the strips are awful fit and use. They just dont stay in place. I wasted 2 sets because they fell off and wouldnt go back on. DO NOT FALL FOR THIS PRODUCT. I have already asked Crest for my money back..which is a hassle unto itself."
2,OUCH.....but whiter,"I must say, using the whitestrips definitely did whiten my teeth. I could see a difference after the first usage, and other people commented, too. The downside to them is the CONSTANT pain in my teeth and gums that I experienced during usage. Seriously---my lower teeth started hurting after the first set of strips, and my gums started hurting after the second. I never thought I had really sensitive teeth--I've never had problems eating ice cream or anything--but these hurt! And the pain wasn't just during the 30minutes of strip-on-the-teeth time: it bothered me around the clock! I would recommend these hesitantly, check out other options first. Like I said, they did work......but be prepared to deal with some pain."
4,"Makes your teeth whiter, but for me they REALLY HURT","I couldn't do it in 7 days. The pain was constant, and distracting. Not everyone will hurt though, but be prepared....I think about a 3rd feel sensitivity, and not everyone feels pain that intensely. It definitely whitened my teeth quite a bit. MUCH better than whitening toothpastes."
3,Not worth the price,The picture shows four targets. You actually only get the square one shown on the hay bales. It is large but the construction material will not last long. Not at all what I was hoping for
2,Too little for the price,"The target doesn't hold up very well to even a youth,tipped arrow. I guess I expected a lot more. Be certain that you know what your getting. Probably best used for suction cup arrows or darts."
1,"Easily shreds, no better than paper",Mounted target to a face of 2 stacked straw hay-bales. Shot into it two crossbow arrows with field points. Results was a shredded area the size of an orange. This target is not worth the price. It is no better than a paper target.
3,leaks air,leaks air through microscopic holes which I cant find.The air hole is small which means I have to inflate it by mouth or through a tire inflator. Cannot use an air bed inflator.
2,Misleading picture,"I got this pool for my 2yo twins... The picture is extremely misleading, it's much smaller and there is hardly any room for three children. The description gives two sizes as well, but it's definitely not bigger than 40 inches."
2,Misleading Description,"Notice there are 2 photos with this product. One photo shows 3 kids sitting in the pool and the other photo shows 1 girl sitting in the pool. These are pictures of two different sized pools. I ordered this pool because the description says it is 66"". It is not 66"". The pool I received (the package matches the picture with one girl sitting in the pool) actually says it is 45"". That's a big difference than the 66"" I thought I was getting. I'm very frustrated. I didn't investigate this until after I inflated the pool and noticed it was much smaller than I expected. That's when I went back and looked at the packaging a little closer. Yes, the picture matches what is displayed here on Amazon, but it is NOT 66"", it is 45"". What a let down."
1,Stuck with wrong pool delivered,"Disappointed in this delivery, as it says it's a 66"" pool, but they delivered a 46"". We know we could pack it up and send it back, but beyond the hassle, two very young kids are standing here breathlessly anxious to get into ""their new pool."" So we're stuck with it. Advice: just don't have the kids around when you open it, and be ready for the hassle of returns and more waiting if they don't deliver what you expected."
4,inexpensive and easy,"This pool is easy to blow up with a air pump and is large enough to fit a few kids. It is a fine value for the money, but is a little difficult to empty."
3,Perfect indoors,"We got this pool to use indoors and filled it with the plastic balls in lieu of water. Works great for that. The pool is EXTREMELY flimsy, and I don't think it would hold up well outdoors with water in it."
5,Great for indoor ball pit,I started using this for my baby at 6 months when she could sit up. I bought Phalate free ball pit balls and threw them inside the blow up pool. She can sit in there for an hour and play with all the colored balls. She love it and helps her get stronger and practice picking up and moving balls for one hand to another. It's big enough that other kids can go in it too. Stores easily too if you need to break it down.
4,Love it!,"I must have gotten lucky and recieved the larger size. I didn't read the reviews before I bought it, the price was too good. My kids are 4 and 2 and this is perfect for them! It's deep enough where they can splash around but not so deep they can't get in and out easily. We only fill it halfway which is plenty!Amazing value for the price, really it is! I only have one complaint, and that's not really this product's fault, but inflatables in general. It loses air, very slowly. I mean a day or three between uses and I have to blow a bit of air into each ring. No big deal at all and hey the pool is a good deal in the bigger 66"" size. Not sure if when I ordered it had anything to do with which you get- I got it in early May."
3,"Received 45"" instead of 66""","Like some of the other reviewers, we mistakenly received the 45"" pool instead of the advertised 66"".Returning the item through Amazon was easy, but they made me call over the phone. After a 5 minute conversation I had a return shipping label sent to my email."
1,Misrepresentation of size!,"Buyer beware. Despite the description from the Seller and the Manufacturer that you are getting a pool that is 66"" x 16"", you are actually getting a much smaller version that is only 45"" x 10"". I am very disappointed and returning it! I just noticed that this has been the common reaction of the buyers. Amazon should stop selling this item as it is a clear misrepresentation!"
3,Got holes in it after first time using it,"Nice pool, a little small, but my two toddlers fit in it fine. The only issue is that when I went to fill it with air the first time, I punctured two out of 3 of the rings with my bicycle pump needle. User error but a little flimsy that it went through so easily."
3,Pool Review,The pool is sturdy and functional yet has a slow leak in the upper tube that I can not locate.
3,Not as expected,"I purchased This pool for my grandson when he comes to visit. I did not get the correct size that I ordered. I got a bigger one then this at Marc's, it was the 66 by 16 inch in the first place before it got a hole in it. I bought this one as a replacement for that one, and it is too small. I should get what I paid for and should've gotten the proper size, for him. I have never been so disappointed in my life with anything from Amazon, except for this. I will just send it back and hope for the right one to come after I return this one. If not, then I will get it somewhere else. It should not be advertised in that size if it is not available. I could have used that money for something else. I am a regular shopper too.D. Dellapenna"
2,Great Swimming Pool! Easy & Quick to Setup!,"This pool was great when I got it. We just left ours outside, so the life of it wasn't that long. It ended up getting a hole after 2-3 months. Other than our mistake, it was easy and quick to setup and my 2 Year Old loved it!"
2,False Advertising,False advertising. The product description clearly states 66 inch by 16 inch pool... but what I received was a 45 inch pool. Big difference! I would have sent it back but since it was only 10 dollars I just gave it away and went to wal-mart to buy the 66 inch one that i wanted for the same price. This transaction was a waste of time.

4,Installed on a 1999 Ford Explorer,They work just fine. The only thing that surprised me about these lifts is that they are upside down compared to the original ones on my Explorer. Follow the instructions and have someone hold the hood up for you.
1,Forbidden,"When I read the book several years back it was a great book. To keep me occupied while working out I thought I would try audiobooks. DON""T get this audiobook unless you like the sound of 13 year old reading the book to you. You can't even decipher the characters (man from woman) and the lady reading the book doesn't even attempt to use an accent. For goodness sakes, they're in Scotland, they are Scottish, Saxons and Normans. Tedious to get through but it made me feel like if I worked harder and faster during my workouts, the book would end quicker. Not so much."
1,Slow with stupid plot,The hero has amnesia and the heroine can't touch other people without feeling pain until the hero arrives in an unconscious state. It took pages for Elizabeth Lowell to get through a scene that could have been told more effectively in a paragraph.In all honesty I didn't get beyond the 4th chapter the tedium was so great. I'm going to start reading Winter Fire now. Hopefully it's better than this one.
1,The story drags too much,"Several times I found myself speed reading to get through it faster. I did not care for the plot which was about a man with amnesia, who falls in love, hates her after he regains his memory, but returns to her in the end. Maybe this plot would be ok if done by another author, but it was not enjoyable the way it was done here. I also found the ending too abrupt. I would have preferred knowing what their life was like after they got together and how the alliances among Dominic, Erik and other warlords worked out. This is the second book I've read by this author. The first book was The Secret Sister which I also did not like. I don't plan to read any more books by this author. Sexual content: moderate."
5,Outstanding Medieval Story..2nd in series....,"If I could melt, after reading a book...this would be it...second in the series. Medieval decriptions and language fantastic! Love story...Hot!!! Amber the untouhed...really...not one can touch her or she feels extreme pain...great book...melting just thinking aboout it..."
5,Wow...,"Just ""Wow"", the twists and turns of all things in this book was amazing. The moments that touched me were the moments that touched the characters...I loved this book!"
5,good idea,It is a good idea to have at least six of these to clean your whole house. However they do sell a similar product at Target.
1,Horrific,"Its preparation could not be farther from the actual test. They concentrate on informing you of absolutely everything about everything that could ever conceivably pop up on an English Language exam, while not focusing on what actually appears on the test. Kaplan lead me to believe, through their obsession--yes obsession is the term--with rhetorical devices that the knowledge of them was what the test (in multiple choice and essay) primarily tested. In reality, in this year's AP exam most of the MC questions were standard reading comprehension and only one of three essays even vaguely dealt with rhetorical devices. In short, the book gets an F and was a waste of my time. Anyone who's taken 3-years of quality highschool English can easily get a 5 on this exam without Kaplan and their mis-guidance."
3,Overpriced!,"Product is nice, but it's like all the other cars that came with the polar express train with the exception of Hot chocolate car written on it! Way over priced!!!"
5,Polar Express car,"The car I purchased was not clear to me with the description. It is the same as one I already had, however, it arrived in new condition and was priced OK. I just have a extra car now. I thought it would look like it was made out of chocolate. Good item at a good price. Thanks."
3,OUTRAGEOUS!,"Also waited a long time for this one and it was worth it!!Love it at home , would love to hear it more often in Clubs.It's the perfect synergy of melodic structures on nice building up Rythm Tracks and each of his Albums is timeless!THANXX TIMEWRITER we need more of this stuff!"
3,Too Much,"I purchased this book because I read two other books by this author 'Shelter During the Storm' a suspense romance and 'Love In A Nick of Time' a multicultural romance. It became obvious to me that 'Dangerous Ground' was the author's first attempt at writing a book. The story had way too much going on: too many characters, too many story lines, and the heroine was too wimpy. If I had read this book first, I never would have purchased the before mention books which I thought were great reads."
2,yes only 2 out of 5,Not sure what the hype is about this one. Wish I could have said something good. Maybe next time.
1,None,The writing is very poor and unispired.Very many mistakes in spelling and expressions make it almost impossible to read.waste of money
1,Poorly made!,I bought these for my son and the quality of this product is horrible. The snaps fell off immediately. I found the pieces laying around the crib. This could be a choking hazard if my son was old enough to put them in his mouth. In addition the airplane decal on the front of onesie completely fell off after one wash.
2,poorly made,The snaps fell off almost immediately on every single onesie. I was thrilled with the price- but now I understand why. This is really a hazard t babies and amazon should consider not selling it. I am disappointed because I washed all of these and now can't return them.
3,Cute but few issues,"My son has been growing so fast and outgrew many of his onesies, so I was looking for a a big pack of 9 month onesies. I love the designs but have just a few issues. After washing they shrunk (got short and wide), but I did wash in hot water so it's probably my fault. The decals on some of the onesies started cracking and chipping after the first wash! On some of the onesies the neckline has also become mishapen and is really big now to the point where it hangs low on his chest and even over his shoulders a bit. They are a nice cotton (not super soft as name implies) and they are thick. Overall they were cute while they lasted but I probably would not buy again. Carters has been working well for me."
2,SpaSilk Onesies,I am pleased with the fabric which is very soft and has some elasticity to it. I am less satisfied with the fit. The legs holes are too large and if my daughter wiggles around much then they show above her pants. The head opening could also be a bit more snug. It tends to sag over the course of the day.Carters still has a lot of the brands beat on fit.
1,Terrible quality,"Other people have said it, but I'll repeat: these are garbage-quality. We always washed on cold, with Dreft, on delicate cycle, and air-fluff dried them. That's not many washes, when you consider how quickly babies grow out of clothes. Even with this gentle treatment, they went from soft out of the box to burlap after the first wash. After two washes, the little applique designs were rubbed off. After less than a month of once-weekly use and washing, the snaps were ripping out of the cloth, which felt like crunchy paper. They are choking hazard, so the two ones we have left that are usable are going in the trash instead of being passed on. Absolutely the worst quality baby clothes we received, bar none."
5,Love these!,"I bought the long sleeve SpaSilk onsies for my grandson so I know what a fine quality product they are. This is the only brand I purchase now for my grandchildren. Thicker, softer, larger and holds their shape."
2,"Okay fabric, horrible tagging!","When I ordered these onesies, I considered the fact that they were made by SpaSilk. I thought perhaps they would be amazingly soft and tagless. Well, they were soft - not amazingly - and they were tagless; however, when I threw his onesies in the wash (on gentle, of course) the printed label on the inside peeled off after they had air dried. Not only that, but after the first was, one of them got a hole in it.I will admit, though, that they did serve their purpose for 2 months. Stains come out of them quite easily."
4,7 pack Onesies,I was happy to find a 7 pack of onesies. I wish it was a larger pack & available in more sizes.
1,Color fastness Bad,"Colors is fixed, but the severity of good and cotton as well as sewing goodI would not advise buying because of the great flaw"
3,Good fabric lousy imprint,"Items have not been used yet. I bought these for, my yet to be born, grandson. I found the fabric very nice and thick and soft but the design was already cracking even before washing. I gave it 3 stars because of the fabric quality and because I embroidered over the design anyway. As they have not been used, I do not know how they will hold up in the wash or if the snaps will hold up (as one review said the snaps all broke - hoping this isn't so)."
1,Poor quality,Poor fitting and the decals started to come off after the first wash. The plain ones are stretched out around the neckline and my son has never even worn them
3,Full of detail,"This book is AMAZINGLY full of facts and details. It's very dry and factual and is just a big compilation of prison riots and history of Prison riots, which is what it claims to be. Great book if you are writing a research paper or an article or another book but pretty tough to read for entertainment purposes. I'm not all the way done with this book but I'm sure over time I'll tough it out and get all the way through it. I knocked stars off for the tiny tiny tiny tiny font the book is printed in and another for the dry nature of the content with no attempt to shape it into a palletable read."
2,"Ralph Waldo Emerson: Selected Essays, Lectures and Poems","Excellent writer, good ideas, but verbose to the extreme. I would enjoy Emerson if his flowery dialogues were to the point. Instead he endlessly adds so much snow to fill fill up a chapter that some of his brilliant thoughts are dulled. In my opinion most of the chapters could have been reduced to a page or two. If you like long conversations with people who endlessly drone on to make their point; if you enjoy long winded discussions, Emerson will entertain you.Dr. Raymond DuRussel"
2,Very Dated,"This book discusses the cultural, historical, psychological, physiologicial, etc. connotations associated with colors. However, it seems as though most of this material was developed in the 1950's and has not been updated. (It looks like this book is a reprint of older material.) There are some interesting elements but it is likely that much of the psychological and physiological information does not reflect the current state of knowledge in those fields.However the book is easy to read and is a good overview on the topic for those who would like to pursue the interest further. I also enjoyed the ""old fashioned"" illustrations at the head of each chapter."
5,A rare treasure,"Once you have seen a real piece of Marghab you will be overwhelmed by the perfection in its making. This book tells the story of Vera Way Marghab who built up the business producing the classic linens so desired today. No, it doesn't show all the different patterns, but it does give you the knowledge to truly appreciate fine needlework on beautiful linens."
4,Very cool book,"This book covers an important segment of American History and the development of modern transportation that is, sadly, largely ignored. Just the excitement of the new 'horseless carriages' should be enough for the settings of numerous books. The best thing about this book is not the 'story' itself, it really serves as a platform on which to showcase the new technology, but the descriptions and stories of the development of automobiles, their features, early issues in travel and politics, etc. This book is so rich with these descriptions that it completely captured this reader, and I have no interest in cars (although now I want to find out more about the early days). I mainly read this book to make sure it wasn't a dud as I planned to give it to my dad as a gift after finding it at a booksale and loving the title and the illustrations. I was pleasantly surprised. The character of Tom is who my dad would have been if alive during that time.I highly recommend this book."
4,Take a Trip to Hell,"This is the second in a series of three (so far). I recommend reading all three, in order. This has a very imaginative take on Dis (Hell) and also has dragons, which is fun. The characters are well developed and the romance is vivid without being overwhelming. I had a little trouble buying the demon but it was a small thing. Overall, a very enjoyable read."
5,Awesome sequel in riveting series!,"I loved this book! It was everything I expected and more. The relationship between Lily & Rule is continually explored and deepens with every new twist, good or bad. But really, it's the side characters in this book that make it! I love them all, but it's Gan who stole my heart and who I can't wait to read more of, and you'll see why! Ms Wilks slowly but surely gives more from each character new and old as her stories progress and fills me with anticipation for every book! On to Blood Lines!"
3,good,This book was good but to me it was slow reading. I did enjoy it but wouldn't give it to someone else to read.
5,"World of Lupi, Book 2",I am glad to received this book. I am waiting to order all of the books so I can ready them in order all at one time.
4,Great Paranormal.,"I love reading paranormal books and sometimes feel that I have read them all. This next installment for Lily and Rule was out of this world literally. I am enjoying the fact that is so book is different.This is the second book, so read the first one first."
3,Very supernatural!!,"Like one of the previous reviewers, I as well had a hard time with this book. There was just simply too much going on and the author went into every little detail. I found myself bored and skipped ahead some pages until the action picked up again. Also, at times I could have slapped Lily Yu for constantly questioning her relationship with Rule. She ""mated"" with him in the previous book ""Tempting Danger"" for godsake!!! Poor Rule.....But nevertheless, I will buy her next book for sure, the premise is great."
2,What the heck happened?,"The first book was great.This... This is horrible.-- EDIT --Ok, it's not *horrible*, but it's a mess and not nearly as good as book #1."
4,"DECORATIVE ONLY, great bargain nonetheless","Shopped around for items like this one online and this was the best value I found. The bridge is made of a very soft wood, almost like balsa wood and has a dark brown finish to it. I don't think this is a protective stain though, so I plan to put a clear varnish on it.Seller claims it will withstand 400 pounds but I disagree. Put it together, took two steps and the second step creaked and I felt the boards move a little. I assure you, I weigh much less than half of the supposed weight limit for this and I don't feel it will support me. However, I did buy it more for decoration, and I think it will work well in my backyard to go over a dry rock ""river"" bed I am creating.I still feel I got a bargain."
3,Tyrannosaurus Rex - 'BBC Radio 1 Live' (Windsong),"This collection of seven tunes was recorded on Januray 1,1970. Marc Bolan was working with his new band,Mickey Finn (always thought that name belonged to a person, NOT an actual band). Overall, this release is okay, specially for the price. Tracks I dug the most were ""Red Hot Mama"", ""By The Light Of A Magical Moon"" and the awesome eight-minute ""Wizard"" (best tune here). Top of the line '70's British glam for the taking.Only complaint I have is the duration is 27 minutes. Too short."
5,Case Closed,"How can anyone criticize this DVD? So what it's not as clean as 1999 House Of Blues. Who cares, the musicianship is 1,000,000 light years better!!!!!! I have 11/8/77 scotland on DVD. I also have Queens Park 1975. Both are awsome, but nothing compares to the 1979 WURMS. The guy that says this was an off night for them should really watch the 1999 show where they're as bland as ever. I mean this DVD is like watching Muhammad Ali in 1974. 1999 House of Blues is like watching Muhammad Ali try to fight today. No matter what anyone says the first 5 minutes of Philadelphia 1979 is better then all of Keys to Acension put together. How can anyone say that bland, lifeless performace is better than this. That's like saying you would rather have $100 in your bank account instead of $1,000,000. Maybe the quality of that DVD is better, but the playing, musicanship, instrumentation is crap compared to Philadelphia 1979. This was created from what was left of an 8mm movie. It's a miracle to have."
1,Forget It,"The DVD format is about excellent video and ""better than CD"" audio. Neither one of these things are present here. Why buy it? I don't know. Get Keys to Ascension and House Of Yes. Both are excellent. Forget this title. The audio is worse than CD and since CD is dead I guess that this DVD should be buried along with it."
2,Ill conceived release,"I normally gobble up everything associated with Yes until now. While I always enjoy listening to their music, this DVD is way too short and is of poor quality (both audio and video). I find it difficult to believe that any of the band members had final say as to whether this show would be released as it has been here."
2,Yes: Live In Philadelphia 1979.......,"Ok.... Let me start by saying this, only diehard fans will find this worth buying... Truthfully, I think this DVD is an absolute joke... As a fan of Yes like many others we deserve better then to have this garbage thrown at us... I was lucky enough not to have invested money on this after seeing it over a friend's house... How anyone could possibly want this is beyond me... The video is poor & the audio is poor & if that wasn't bad enough this is what the set list is / Track listing:""Siberian Khatru""""Circus of Heaven""""Alan White Drum Solo""""The Ancient"" (excerpt)""Starship Trooper""""I've Seen All Good People""""Roundabout""I mean seriously are you kidding me? This seems to be a regular trend with these DVD companies - they find some old tapes of whatever band - they won't invest money to fix-up the video or the audio - so they put it out as is & don't care about the quality of it... Fans deserve better than this..."
2,Worth it if for 'Circus Of Heaven' only...,"I've always wanted to hear 'Circus Of Heaven' live, and that part is nice, but the grainy, camcorder-style video and muffled sound quality really put a damper on this. Worth a rent or if budget priced for the collector only. Throughout it all, Yes still rules!"
1,"what is this, a bootleg?","If Yes is going to release an old concert from Philly, why pick one that's such poor recording? Why not release the live in Philly show from the Big Generator tour? That show has a lot more songs and is a lot better sound and picture quality. Why not release that concert from the Union tour that they kept showing clips from on the YesYears video? They could have picked a better concert than this 1979 to release. What about the Keys To Ascension show? Even if you're a big Yes fan, you should skip Live In Philadelphia 1979 because it's a big disappointment. Send the band some e-mails and tell them to release videos from the Big Generator and Union tours because they obviously filmed some of those concerts."
1,Bad Homemovie,"Stay away from this piece of garbage!!! I'm a huge Wakeman fan, and had to have it (or so I thought). Audio is beyond poor, and the video looks like a bad homemovie. Add this to a short running time, and you get a real piece of trash. Only get this if you have money you have to get rid of."
2,What were they thinking?,"In 1979, there was a chemical reason that the sound and picture were not in synch. In 2000, did they not think enough to try to match the soundtrack with the video?What were they thinking?"
3,"Historical Interest Only - Sound, Picture, Shooting Bad","Philadelphia was Yes's home away from home. The Delaware valley was where Yes came to rehearse before their tours. Everyone there was a Yes fan. I saw them in Philadelphia. Why, then, is the only visual document of that time and place this awful film?My main gripe, besides the low-quality video, and the really sad sound, is that whoever directed the film knew absolutely nothing about the band or its music, missing cues, shooting Chris Squire when Steve Howe is soloing, giving us Jon Anderson pounding on a tamborine as Rick Wakeman burns up the keyboards. What gives?Yessongs is much better introduction, but for historical/nostalgia purposes, this essay in amatuerism has some interest. Buy it used."
2,What went wrong with the DVD transfer of this?,"I am a huge Yes fan(have been for around 23 years).This 1979 Philly performance has much better audio quality on the Japanese laserdisc,cause I own it on LD,too.On DVD,it is very muffled and lifeless.Live in Philly,on either DVD or LD,is way too short.I saw them 3 days after the Philly show,and they played just over 2 hours.I don't understand why we get a very abbreviated show."
4,You wonder how they snuck Tormato in the lineup,"Sorry to bash Tormato you fans of that album but my point is that when it came out, people bought it because it was Yes period. I do not remember hearing any song off of it before it was on the shelves so that alone is a bad omen.I put this on and yes video and audio circa the late 70's. I expect that and have no problem, it is like idiots demanding we have pristine video quality from the movies filmed during action in WWII........it aint happening folks! WE CANT GO BACK IN TIME AND RESHOOT IT!!!!!Aside from that rant, song selection is OK but of course Circus of Heaven is at least played but thank god they didnt try to shove all of Tormato down the crowds throat.I would not and did not pay a whole lot for this but am glad I got it at the price I did. I would by more like it just to have footage. I am really thinking of taking the dive into Yessongs. Anyone out there care to comment on that one?"
3,Fantastic,"I saw Yes at the Spectrum in 1979. This was a great concert.Starship Trooper alone is worth the listen.The other people in these reviews are looking forperfection. Maybe it just wasn't there, sorry.That doesn't mean this DVD isn't worth watching.For me it was like re-living the whole concert.Seeing the original members in their prime in oneof the best venues was unforgetable, this videois what it is. I like it."
2,The Bad and the Ugly,Awful....poor recording...poor concert...uninspired...razor deep...the worst thing to come out of Philadelphia since those choking Eagles...for Danschamdroza and the like...shame on the company that produced and sold this ...prog robbers.
2,"Obsolete sound,video; too short.","Only for fans, archivists. Cover does not list enough info. Too few songs and boring camera work. Wait for a new original DVD with the line-up you prefer (if Yes ever puts one out).They must have something newer/better in storage!"
2,Caveat emptor...,"I was also looking forward to seeing this (it would have been a great souvenir of that tour), but let's be honest...the sound quality SUCKS...it's not much better than a bootleg...in fact, I've heard boots from this tour that sound way better than this. The video quality is decent, not spectacular. Furthermore, the whole thing is too short...some of the show's highlights such as the Time & A Word -> -> Soon medley should have been included. I would have thought something released under the Yes name could have had better sound than this, it's not like 1979 was the sonic dark ages"
3,"For completists, but worth it","Others have probably already pointed out the drawbacks of this video, but as a long-time, hardcore Yes fan I still found it worth the purchase. This is partly because even though loads of audio recordings exist from this period there is little to no video to be had besides this. So from a historical perspective it's interesting to see the band performing at what was arguably their commercial peak, but right before Anderson and Wakeman left and the classic 70s era came to a close. If you're a stickler for high production values and good sound and lighting then you're sure to be disappointed. But for fans who can look past those shortcomings this can be a worthy addition to your Yes video collection."
3,Avoid unless you have a really good reason to buy,"I was at this show, but my memory of it is a little ""foggy"". So I had a reason to buy the DVD.Unless you have a similar excuse - or are a diehard fan - avoid this DVD. All the other comments about sound and video quality are absolutely true - only half a notch above a boot.It only gets 3 stars for it's historical interest."
1,Don't Bother,"Don't waste your time or money. If a quality representation of Yes at its ""classic"" best is what you seek, check out Keys to Ascension. Better yet, get your hands on a copy of Yes live at QPR. This is a fantastic document filmed during their peak on the 1975 Relayer tour. There is a company in Hong Kong who has released this on dvd (2 vols.)Go to Ebay and type ""Yes QPR DVD"" in the search. Enjoy the genuine article."
1,Shame on the band for putting this out,"The sound on this DVD reminds me of the worst recordings I have ever heard. Yes was never in my mind all that interested in the quality of thier recordings. Close to the edge comes to mind...Too bad, because I consider them to be among my favorites over the years. I have seen them 3 times live and have never been disappointed with the quality of sound in person. This item should be removed from the shelves for poor quality in sound"
2,"Tormato, Not Old Hat.","I think we all feel the same way about this DVD. I mean-its historic...but its dismal. Not only is the video quality poor, the band just wasnt on that night. They were all sooooo b o r i n g and probably bored with themselves. The thing that REALLY ticked me off was that I was expecting the Tormato show...not old songs like ""roundabout"" or ""starship trooper"". Instead...one song from Tor performed live! And it happens to be my least favorite song on this album(circus of heaven). Its a shame......BUT, there is hope. If you can find DVD 1 and 2 for the 1975 QPR show....then you are in luck. Absolutely THE best show recorded of YES. And besides....the sound quality is nice and the video quality is so much better."
4,Don't listen to the negative reviews,"A very good representation of Yes in 1979. Sound isn't great but the picture is really good. Loses one star because of sound and it is too short.Other songs performed that night but not on the DVD:Heart Of The SunriseFuture Times/RejoiceTime And A Word/Long Distance Runaround/Survival/The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus)/Perpetual Change/SoonClapArriving UFOTour SongAnd You And IAwakenI'm sure they were filmed also, were are they???"
1,BAN THIS DVD ...SIGHT TORTURE...BURN THE RECORD COMPANY,"Undoubtedly the worst concert DVD ever made, even if someone gives this DVD as a gift you should punch that person in the face...after watching this DVD I felt like burning down the company that made this DVD . If you want to play a practical joke on someone then might as well give this DVD to him as a gift. Save the money you would spend on this DVD and buy yourself a subway sandwich , it would do you good. If you plan to buy this DVD even after reading what I have written, then be prepared to kick yourself on the ass after you do so."
3,yes not YES!,"It is good to see the band at their peek (1979 line-up) and to see them ""In the Round"" since I have the Yesshows album and have always like the pictures included. Other than these elements, there is alot of problems with this DVD; it is TOO short (only 6 songs), the sound quality is horable (has that bootleg sound so the audiance is louder than the music), and the camera work is very bad! It is a good renter DVD, but don't buy it unless you are a die-hard fan."
1,Don't Bother!,"Don't waste your time or money. If vintage Yes concert material is what you're after, check out Keys to Ascension. Better yet, grab yourself a copy Yes Live at QPR. This is a full concert document of Yes at their peak during the 1975 Relayer tour. A company out of Hong Kong has released this on two dvd's (playable in all regions). Go to Ebay and type ""Yes QPR DVD"" in the search. Highly recommended."
5,TURN IT UP,"This dvd was amazing. It was like a time machine transporting me back to the seventies. I turned up the sound and had no problems with it after that, especially since it got the non-YES fans in my family out of the room. The picture wasnt perfect, by today's standards, but what do you expect from a concert that was recorded almost 40 years ago....If you are true YES fans, you've got to get this. PEACE."
2,"stay away, unless your a real die hard!","Im a big Yes fan! although this video probably captures the pinacle of the yes years, the video is second rate and dark alot of the time. The video is also short. Less than an hour I believe. This could have been great :("
3,"Great Band, Great Concert - Poor Film Quality","The film quality is poor, as is the sound quality, even for 1979. However, if you're a YES fan that's easily overlooked for the pleasure of the experience. This film captures Yes at the height of their touring and musical catalog. It also was an added bonus that I was actually at this concert (I even checked the ticket stub to verify it - making it a special treat to re-live). All in all it's worth the price!"
1,a cheap shocker...,"for nostalgia freaks only, I could barely sit through this, parasitic use of a brand name to sell amateurish 'product'."
1,Not the best,"I have owned this pad (not exact one, in blue) for 5 months and all of my friends own this pad as well. This pad works well for beginners, but once you have reached light, standard, and difficult it begins to slide around because it doesn't have a grip. I once had a party and when we were playing it, by the end of the song the pad had slid up about 2 feet and turned diagnally. I have also slipped and fallen using this pad. If you fold the pad there is a good possiblity that the sensors will move and the pad will become useless, this happened to my friend, so don't fold it if you buy it. I suggest that you don't buy this pad because you can probably get a much better one for only a few dollars more. In the end, spending a few more extra dollars will be worth it and you'll be safer."
1,Not happy with these mats..,"I bought 3 of these because they were on sale really cheap. One of the mats died within a week. They slip a lot on carpet so you need to put something under it or else you will be all over the place. At size 11.5 shoe (there were no show size warnings when I bought them) I tend to hit other buttons (which is not a problem with some other brand mats and the arcade). On my (old, original copy of DDR for the original ps) start+reset pressed simultanously resets the game and sometimes when I'm playing the game just resends. I'm assuming it's because the mat sends the wrong signals. Even in socks, I ended up having to tape the corners down to keep the mat straight and non-wrinkled. Spend the few extra dollars and get a higher quality mat."
1,Dance mat....horrible,I bought this mat thinking it would be just as good as the offical konami ones and it was a bad investment because it doesn't respond like it should and it isn't that old either....I talked to a friend of mine who owns the konami mats and they said that the mat I have is cheap..
1,Not worth it,"I purchased this pad at my local Frys Electronics for close to $40 thinking I would be able to use it to replace some $2.99 pads I bought several months ago.As it turns out, this pad slides around constantly, has no sensitivity whatsoever, and is all together a piece of junk. The pads I purchased for $2.99 are higher quality than this one. Stay away!"
1,Not a very good dance pad,"The madcatz dance pad is not a very good product. The buttons are small and too close together, and the design is just horrible. What was Madcatz thinking?The response on the pad is ok, about what you'd expect from 3rd party products, but there are better 3rd party products out there. The buttons don't register sometimes and you'll find that they get stuck after playing for a while.All in all, this pad isn't really worth the price and you're much better off sticking with dance pads made by Konami and RedOctane."
4,"Good, inexpensive dance pad",The Mad Catz dance mat is a solid product and a good and inexpensive alternative to the official Konami dance mat. The buttons are clearly labeled and the mat fits feet up to size 11. (Anything bigger you might trigger a button accidentally.) It's easy to install. I've used mine heavily for about a month now and it's still like new.
3,Works ok but there are drawbacks,"Well, it works ok...and it's cheap, but it is a heck of a lot bigger than the arcade controller (the arrows are much farther apart), so when you go to the arcade you may end up stepping on someone's feet multiple times (like me). Also I am 5'4'' and I have some trouble keeping my balance because the buttons are too far apart. So I definitely wouldn't recommend it for little kids. I swear my coordination isn't that bad. Really. Also there is no anti-skid material on the bottom, so it does slip on carpeting and you kind of have to move it every song. I'm not brave enough to try it on a wood floor."
1,Disappointed!!,"I ordered 2 of the dance mats for my 4 children...I was very excited as they were to be Christmas presents. My children had played DDR at a friends and absolutely loved it. When they opened their game and mats on Christmas morning...they of course wanted to play it immediately. However, we could not get the mats to work with our DDR game on the Playstation2. Our friends had the DDR dance mat and it works great...."
2,Primarily United Kingdom resources rather than USA...,"My rating reflects annoyance with the description of the book's contents from its cover and blurbs rather than opinion of the actual content. I expected a resource for United States (US) information and discovered this book primarily targets United Kingdom (UK) resources - no mention on book cover of this. Of the 729 pages only about 47 pages specifically list US Publishers, US Literary Agents, US Media Contacts(in the UK) and US Writing Courses. The generalized content is, of course, applicable to any writer anywhere but if you are looking for comprehensive details about UNITED STATES publishers, media resources, literary agents and all the other US based contacts where a writer might submit his work there are better books to deliver those options.However if you want a thorough resource for UNITED KINGDOM contacts then this is certainly a viable option."
1,Save your money,"\The minute I started to sand with it the little flap started to come off with in minutes all the flaps where gone. Don't know what I was doing wrong , I was just sanding some soft wood. Don't even think about ordering this."
5,books toddlers love,"This was the favorite book of both my children when they were 2 and 3 year-olds. They both remember the book so fondly that this year my daughter, now grown and married, said she'd lost her copy in a move and that's all she wanted for Christmas was its replacement. It took some searching to find the 1970's edition she remembers- but I did. This book is such a treasure and Amazon site made this memory-rich purchase possible. Thanks so much"
5,Extraordinary children's book!,"I just found this book on our bookshelf at home and it brought back a thousand memories. Unfortunately, one of those memories is drawing in it with red crayon, so I hoped that I could buy it here! How are children growing up without this book? I spent hours every night studying the pictures. It made what most people would view as ordinary in the world seem extraordinary. It encouraged me to use my imagination. It HAS to be reprinted!"
2,"Wonderful Book, Poor Reprint","First off, this book is wonderful -- this is purely a review of the reprint. I still have a beat up version of the original -- this one literally pales in comparison. The colored pages look like a color xerox copy; the colors are not nearly as vibrant and the images aren't as crisp.It looks like all of the text was reset, and so far I've found one passage completely missing. (""Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear."") It also has a much wider leading, so the proportions are off.This is a visual book, so I was very disappointed that this was such a poor reproduction."
2,This book contains a very very sad story indeed,"Don't get me wrong - I love the artwork of the author...But the ''sad story"" part in this book is just horrific in my opinion. This book is intended for preschoolers and I just don't understand how am I suppose to present a story about two babes dying alone in a woods to my 2 year old...It is so sad and disconnected with the rest of the book that I just don't feel I want to keep it... Even skipping it for now and waiting till the child is older and can read it to himself is still daunting... The story has absolutely no purpose, no moral or anything.. It says that two babies for stolen away and found themselves in a woods where they bitterly cried and died that night... How terrbile is that.."
1,Riddled with mistakes,"I am studying to join the Air National Guard as an officer. I was refered to this book by my recruiter to begin studying for the AFOQT. Now, since I am a whiz at English and Science I did not look at those sections very carefully. What I DID look at was the mathematics and engineering sections.How can a book go to print with so many mistakes? I am certainly no math whiz... but even I picked up on many of the mistakes right off the bat. Sometimes the author even shows the work and gets the right answer... but the answer key shows the wrong answer.I actually stormed back into my local Borders (where I purchased this book) and demanded a refund. I got quite angry with the management for even carrying this book full of tripe.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK"
1,Barron's Officer Candidate School Test,"As many others point out, the book is filled with errors. You will have to double check the math sections regardless of if you are right or wrong. There were too many occasions where I was ""wrong"" only to double check and realize that they made mistakes in their math. Considering I was given this book by someone who had previously used it, I didn't mind the errors and it forced me to double check my work and get extra practice. I used it for the AFOQT and found all other sections to be helpful for the most part."
1,Barron's Officer Candidate School Test,This book have many typos and errors. There were 4 errors for 4 different problems under 1 subtest (ARITHMETIC REASONING). Save yourself some money and time by purchasing a different book.
2,Why so many errors?,"I am an engineer by profession. I borrowed this book from a friend and when I got home I read the introductory material then jumped straight to the math/physics portion (an area I grasp). I was amazed at the amount of errors I could find while working the material just in the math section. They make simple errors like not cancelling units through an equation. I would not recommend this book based on the errors I found in the math/physics section. My reading and comprehension suck so it's a good thing I didn't rely on this book as a base for the entrance exam. Sorry Barron, but you need to get a physics teacher to redo the physics and a math teacher to redo the math."
2,not a very good study guide,"I ordered this book as a suggestion from my Lt to study for the ASTB. I have found several flaws, some wrong answers and poor explinations and breakdowns on how to get the right answer...I would not recomend this book"
1,FULL OF ERRORS,The book has numerous math errors! I emailed Barron's about the issue and received a list of about 40 errors in the book and I've found even more they didn't catch. This was a huge setback to my studying for the ASTB and I find it blasphemous that the book has not been pulled from shelves.
2,Only somewhat helpful,"While this book had some useful information in it, I found the practice questions and tests to be quite flawed. On several occasions, the answers given were wrong, and some of the questions and explanations used the wrong terminology. Some of the diagrams in the mechanical comprehension section of practice tests were not fully labeled. If I had not had access to a math teacher/mechanical engineer, this book would have barely been of any use."
3,Helpful but.....,Overall glad I bought a book like this but if I might have purchased a different one. I've found a few errors in the subject lessons.
2,Not what I expected,"I think all the other sections are useful, but the math section... Holy crap. First off.. I think someone forgot to tell this person the AFOQT is taken without a Calculator. I was more confused trying to understand the questions he was asking rather than figuring them out. If you buy this book, buy it as an addition for more practice in the other sections besides the math. I see his idea of trying to make it way harder then the actual test so it will be cake for you. Come on.. like this question would reall be asked on a test: What is the average (arthimetic mean ) of all the multiples of ten from 10-190 inclusive? << wtf. I enjoy the Arco way better.. more realistic."
2,Too many errors for a test prep book.,"I would agree with the guy who previously reviewed this. I am in the process of studying for the AFOQT and while taking the math practice exercises I have found three errors in the first 41 questions. What gives? Someone should have checked these before going to print.Under the Mathmatics Knowledge practice exercises, there are errors on #28, #34, and #41. And I am not even all the way through yet."
2,ERROR-FILLED!,"There aren't a whole lot of options if you are looking for officer candidate test study guides, in particular, the Navy's ASTB. The one by Peterson's was a better choice than this one. The author has wrong answer and/or wrong explanations littered throughout this book. It really makes you uneasy studying because if you are truly lost and have to depend on this book, you will end up learning some procedures incorrectly or just dumbfounded at how he got some of his answers. I got this as my second book, after I went through the Peterson's guide, and while it gave a better description of the answers than Peterson's, the number of wrong answers are just unforgivable...don't buy it unless you are just brushing up or have another guide. Bottom line, check out the OCS Test book by Petersons."
2,Several typos...Look for other books.,"I ordered this book about a year ago. I was excited when it finally came in because I was looking at going back into the military as an officer. Unfortunately, there are SEVERAL typos in the book. Most of them are in the math section...the section I needed the most help in. Some of the answers are wrong, and also some of the questions are wrong.For more info on this test book, check out this link:[...]"
2,Errorlicious,"This book is... alright. I wasn't expecting much more than a blank answer sheet for photocopying, a lot of practive tests, and some answer keys to score myself. I got a little more, but nothing really stuck out at me.The only irritating this were the errors. Errors, errors, errors. I remember there being at least one in most sections, often multiples. I'd look at a basic problem, find the answer, and then get it wrong... only to notice that the key was wrong (he marked the wrong answer, but had the right explanation), that the explanation was wrong (but that the key was correct), or that the answer and the question were completely unrelated (copy + paste error, perhaps?). I'm pretty sure I spent much more time reviewing my incorrect answers to be sure the key wasn't wrong than I did reading the book or using the practice tests.My memory of college Calculus is fuzzy, and even some stuff before that, but jeeze. This guy needs a refresher course badly. How did this get out the door?!"
2,MxPx holds it all together...,"I don't know about the rest of the cd, but the MxPx song rawks. It's the only reason I bought the disc. It's a really good song, regardless of the others. Anyway, regular cd, awesome MxPx, as always."
4,Christian artists cover the songs of Petra.,"This ia a very good C.D......I especially liked ""Road to Zion"" by Sixpence None the Richer and ""Yahweh Love"" by Sarah Jahn. It was this one song sung by Sarah that got me hooked on her beautiful style and voice. If you like it, listen to her album ""Sparkle""; also available through amazon.com. There are many different bands/styles represented here, including the increasingly popular MXPX."
4,Sardonic Dark Comedy,"If you are familiar with John Gregory Dunne only through the novel and movie ""True Confessions"" you owe it to yourself to find a copy of this underrated, bleakly funny novel. Dutch Shea, Jr. is a down-on-his-luck lawyer with a bitter ex-wife, a beloved daughter murdered by terrorists, and a few secrets he would rather keep private. Over the course of a few days his existence is turned inside out when the true facts of his life are unburied (quite litterally, in the case of his dead father.) You will come to feel for Dutch as he struggles to keep from going under. Dunne makes despair comic, and when you finish this dark story, perversely, you will feel much better."
1,Driver conflict on NT 4.0 with SP6,"I bought this and installed the hardware/software. Then PC freezes up after use of scanner for 30 seconds or so. Sometimes it freezes even without using scanner. Tried latest driver on their web, no help. Turns out they have driver to solve freeze problem for some other version of their scanners, but not for this. Promptly returned.I am disturbed by the current practice of software/hardware industry for shipping a product without thorough QA. I am extremely happy with the current practice of electronic dealers for letting buyers refund their money without much probing.Do not recommend if you have NT 4.0 (even though the box says it is supported). I have Service Pack 6 and SQL Server 7 installed, not sure if that's the reason. No time to find out.Bryan"
1,Not Compatable with AMD processors!,"A few months ago I purchased this model for use on my AMD processor equipped PC. I run win98SE and have used other USB devices with no trouble. Well, this scanner did not function at all. Tech support was no help. Then I read in the FAQ section of Visioneer's web site that their products do not work with VIA chipsets (most often used with AMD processors). So if you have an amd equipped machine think twice about buying Visioneer. By the way I later purchased an Epson 1200U and it works great!"
5,Dream Come True,The instructions in this book are easy to follow and the variety of structures to choose from is great. With help from friends we built one of the gazebos in our backyard. We love it.
4,Good Bye Mr. Peterson. :-(,"I'm reserving the right to speak at great lengths about this upcoming Front Line Assembly record until I've heard it in its entirety. However, judging from this single I can only guess that fans of Hard Wired and Millennium will most surely be thrilled. Rhys Fulber is back in the fold and it's REAL obvious. Fans of the Chris Peterson stuff may be a bit put off as the 2 tracks displayed here represent a less innovative side of Front Line. From what I can tell Leeb has his foot planted firmly in the nearest discothèque with a yearning to hit the concert stage. - C. Curry"
4,I knew they wouldn't let us down.,"To answer the question that SHOULD be on everyone's mind, YES THERE IS GUITAR ON THIS CD. Thank god too, I was starting to worry about FLA's direction. I wouldn't really compare the metal value of this to 'Millenium' but it's still rad. And as an added super bonus, they even started throwing around movie clips once again. I hoping that 'Epitaph' was just something they were getting out of their system. Or maybe Rhys brought Bill to his senses and got the guitar element back. There's no denying FLA's greatest moments were on the metal side. I hope to see a lot more of this on their new album. Maybe they'll even have some Strapping Young Lad guests play on it like the old days."
1,no class literature,There is so much beauty in literature...why not write about things that make sense to most of the world.
1,Humph.,"What a waste of time. Does anyone actually buy these kinds of books? Besides, there are many schools more deserving of hatred . . ."
1,I Blame the Publisher for this Junk!,"This was a disappointing book from the word GO, not just from the hackneyed lines delivered by the characters but the plot in general. I believe the publisher pushed this through hoping to make quick money off the writer's popularity."
2,Not for the faint of heart,"I bought this book based on the glowing review that appeared in Elle, and while I agree that the writing is excellent and the subject intriguing I found the descriptions of the child abuse and haunting voices of the aborted/murdered fetuses were really too dark and disturbing to bear. I will say that Ms. Yamanaka's ability to deftly interweave descriptions of past events and dream-like sequences into the narrative flow of the novel is extremely engaging, but I really couldn't get past the utter depth of despair and pain that all of the characters in the book seem to be immersed in. I'm not saying don't read this book, I'm saying that if you do, be prepared for a really dark and creepy ride."
4,Cheap with substance,15 bones gets you a solid chunk of primary source. buy it!comes in the Greek AND the English.
3,"Love the concept, but...","I really like the concept in this series of photography books. Think about what attracts you about the image, then work to get that effect in the finished product. It's a very useful and systematic approach which one can follow in the field. My problem with this particular book in the series, as well as with his color photo book, is that his finished images don't move me. I kept thinking about the Ansel Adams remark, ""Inside many a picture there's a good photograph waiting to come out"", and I yearned to crop the image to something which had more effect."
3,Uneven but interesting,"What we have here is a compilation of collected essays and excerpts from other sources on the sin of gluttony. Three of the contributions make the book worth owning.Woody Allen's comedic essay, Russell Baker's 'tongue in cheek' food critique and John Kennedy O'Toole's excerpt from ""A Confederacy of Dunces"" are the strong and entertaining parts of the book. The rest...well, let's just say there is little left to read after the above mentioned...but they're not sooo bad thatyou'll lose your appetite for Gluttony."
3,Some tasty light reading,"This collection is uneven; I agree with the other person to review this book that the pieces by Baker, Toole, and Allen are the best, although I also enjoyed Buford's account of hungry and thirsty soccer fans and Trevor's somewhat poignant remembrance of his gourmand accountant. This makes a fine gift book (that's how I got it) and some nice escapist fare."
4,DIVERSE Weight Training,"Great overall toning - the more weights you use, the better your shape. She's diverse in her routines as you admire the beach in the background. Denise Austin uses many routines including a bench (I use a table) and explains how your muscles react by certain exercises and their benfits. The video take a full 45 minutes from warm up to cool down but you'll notice better body tone in just the first few times you work out (even if you dont' make it all the way through). I definitely recommend."
3,Doesn't quite meet expectations,"I was waiting years to find on DVD format the two promo videos for ""Kiss Me Deadly"" and Ozzy duet ""Close My Eyes Forever"" : Absolute great videos, and surely among my favourites. But sorry to say her live performances lack charisma and just can't stand up to the well packaged videos mentioned above."
3,COMPLETE VIDEO COLLECTION..........Hmmmmm,"Hey, I remember Lita Ford before ""Kiss Me Deadly"". Where are those videos??????????? Hey Lita!!!!!!!!!!!!! What happened to the video ""GOTTA LET GO"". Complete video collection???? Complete BS, I guess......."
4,A good basic function bike computer.,"I had good luck with my Cateye Astrale. The cadence function stopped working after about 2K, but the main functions worked until I'd put about 6K on it. After that the start-stop button was worn out, but by that time I felt I'd gotten my money's worth out of the computer. I find it easy to see and use on the road, and the owners manual instructions didn't seem any worse than most I've seen. It would be nice to have a 2nd trip odometer sometimes, but if the functions that it provide are all that you need, then I'd recommend it (I just bought a duplicate to replace my original)."
4,great,"I love this product once I got it to work. They instruction sheet was confusing so I went to you tube. And found a great instruction video and now I'm happy.,great product!"
4,Solid computer,"This is a very good bike computer for the price. Its easy to read the output, etc. In that regard I would highly recommend it. I had a hard time getting the part that connects to the actual computer mounted on the bike. If you move it the wrong way you can't get the plastic piece to disconnect. Be careful when installing this part because its easy to break. Too, the only complaint is the lack of instructions. Follow the picture manual carefully. After I got the computer holder mounted on the handlebar it was much easier after that. Again, you don't have to strain your eyes to read the output and not that hard to install. Just go slowly. Great bargain."
2,Just ok,It's just ok- a week after purchasing it the screen goes blank. I guess it needed to be jiggled in order to work again.
2,Ok..but not great,"While I like the functions this offers, the screen is a bit hard to read when riding. Also, the instructions aren't very easy to follow. For example, it is displaying in kilometers per hour but the instructions don't say how to convert to miles/hour. I would probably not buy this again."
1,dont buy,do not buy this product. the directions are ridiculous and are the most confusing set of instructions i have ever seen. Good Luck trying to figure out how to properly install and use computer. I sent mine back.
1,available free,"This book is available free, legally, from many download sites on the Internet. Google search will lead you to it."
2,IT SEEMS TO BE A GOOD PRODUCT,"I received the whatch in time and in good conditions, HOWEVER with NODOCUMENT that guarantee its authenticity and with NO CERTIFICATE provided by the seller. I will take the watch to an authorized seller to be sure about its authenticity. Unfortunately I received no document that justify this expensive watch. - Luciano Reis."
5,GREAT WATCH,"GREAT WATCH, GREAT LOOK , EXELENT QUALITY! LIKE ALL OMEGA ., FOR ME THE BEST WATCHES ON EARTH! BESIDES THE PRICE WAS REALLY GOOD, THANKS TO JOMASHOP(THE BEST PRICE I FOUND)NO COMPLAINS EXEPT THEY KEEP THE INTERNATIONAL W. CARD."
3,"Beautiful watch, but the box was dirty inside ... not nice","I purchased this watch new and directly from Amazon thinking that it would guarantee the best quality. Well, the watch was in excellent condition but the white felt inside was dirty. A real shame for such an expensive item."
3,It does what it is intended to do,"This item is fine if the operator has a soft touch on the tool. The flaps are very rigid, so any effort to work the wheel into a tight space results in damage to the surrounding material. This should NOT be used on detail for old or very dry wood."
4,lets get growing,"I really liked this book a lot. It gives you a broad picture of the history to having dank buds. Although the pictures that are in the book, can't seem to stay in the book. I would suggest buying it binder style if you can!"
3,Surprised to see this one still here..,My uncle used to keep this old grow book in his drawer. This is the oldest of the modern grow guides if my memory serves me correct. I have read a few editions of this since. Not a bad grow manual but a little bit on the old side now.
5,"A ""must have"" for any cannabis enthusiast","If you grow your own, this book is the first thing that you should invest in. All information on growing are given to the reader in a very comprehensive way. There are three books that should be in every cannabis enthusiast's home; ""Marijuana growers guide""(Mel Frank, Ed Rosenthal) , ""Hashish"" (Rob Clarke"" and ""Stir crazy, cooking with cannabis"" (Quick american archives) Definetly the best grow guide I've read. Read it!"
2,Marijuana growers guide is overrated,"Even though I learned alot from this book. I found that the information was too vague. I would read the chapter on a subject and still have questions. I believe this book is not good for a beginner for the terminology is too advanced.The pictures were cool, but maybe some pictures of the actual things they talk about...eg. like how to take cuttings. Showing what a growing shoot is. This book is written on assumptions that people already know what they are doing...In my opinion if you already know what you are doing you dont need a book, this book especially. Maybe a book that could make you learn everything in lamemans terms would be better if you are just starting."
5,real hemingway.,This video is a masterpiece. I love Hemingway and here the man is captured in all his in your face-tortured-life loving-woman loving glory. The language in this video is hardly disturbing which makes me think the person who wrote a review for this video claiming it was full of curse words did not actually see it. If anything this video will instill in the viewer a need to read more about the man and his work. A rare video. I've seen it a half dozen times and it never loses it hold on me. For any Hemingway fan this is a must.
4,Biography: Ernest Hemingway -Wrestling with Life (DVD),"A worthwhile and well constructed precise of Hemingway's life, most valuable for its insights from Hemingway's sons and archival moving film footage, including some sound bites of Hemingway speaking. The video relies (necessarily) on a fair amount of still photography, much of which will be familar to Hemingway aficionados, nevertheless, the presentation is compelling."
4,"Good stuff, but a bit dated","As a new teacher looking for material to accompany my lessons, I bought this to show to my 11th grade American Lit students. I ended up returning it only because after renting it from the library, I decided I preferred to own the more recent documentary on Hemingway's life, ""Rivers to the Stream.""""Wrestling with Life"" is narrated by a very stiff and serious Mariel who looks like she's about 18. It also goes a bit too extensively into his childhood and his antipathy towards his mother. But keep in mind I bought this to view with my 11th graders so I was also watching it through their highly crticial and easily distractable eyes. Had it been the only one available, it would have done the job. But the newer DVD is much richer in my opinion. (I found the negative reviews of ""Rivers to the Stream"" completely unfounded;I had no problem with female narration of his short stories.)"
2,"WHERE'S ""YOU CAN'T DENY IT""???",Her best video ever is conspicuously absent from this collection - whazzup with dat?
5,Serial Killer Art Collecting,"This film was put together very well, and worth every penny. It is accurate about the historical events that lead up to serial killers, and the art they produced. A must have in any true crime collection."
3,Where'd it go?,"This was originally available on Youtube, and certain part shot at the ""Manson"" house are not present in this version, which I feel makes it incomplete. Otherwise it's a great look into a very touchy subject of american fascination."
4,Nice ice baby!,"What's up with Norway lately? Out of the blue come 2 great albums from that country - one by Royksopp that all music lovers should own and this one by Polar. I love drum 'n bass music, but I have to admit most of it is not aimed at the cortex or higher brain regions. This effort by Polar, in contrast to most d 'n b is very intelligent, yet it's still got the beats and grooves all heads seek. It's on the Certificate 18 label if that means anything to you, e.g., home to artists like Klute. Some cuts like Inside the Plot are almost jazzy a la Peshay. Others, like Nascent Dream and the title cut, are bouncey and beatastic. White Walls and White Chambers are kind of trippy. There really is a lot a variety here. I think most d 'n b enthusiasts will enjoy the album."
4,Another good release from certificate 18,"I waited a month to get ahold of this cd and it was worth the wait. The sublimely produced 'Still Moving' Lp is a work of genius on the part of K aka Polar. It is by far one of my favourite DnB cd's I own.For a young artist this 2nd release demonstrates a sign of a musical maturity and evolution that will surpass any of the current dnb producers out on the market at the moment . If you like his partner's music (Teebee) you will love this fast paced sci-fi ride into the dark abyss of beat, bassline and electro melody bliss. I highly recommend this cd for any Dnb/Jungle or electronica enthusiast."
3,5-loxin,"Have been using this product for about 1 month, no discernable benefit at the prescribed dose."
3,U.S. Robotics Wireless Adapter,"Easy to install. Works but, still too far from router to keep consistent. Would buy again."
1,poor product,I found the unit gave low reception levels and had to use its software to operate. Was not compatible with windows software.I have a cheaper belkin that gives better sensitivity.
3,"Mort lead than alive at Billy Bobs; mort, not asleep!","Wow! If this 'band' could purge itself of the Lawrence Welk influences and find a way to make the voices sound even a little distinctive, it would still be a far cry from music that I wanna listen to! The group is bland and derivative, worse the entire group seems to be manufacturing the fun instead of having it. Two cuts, Route 66 and Dont Fence Me In are guaranteed covers...guaranteed enjoyable...but NOT HERE. It takes real lead to drag these cuts down, but Asleep is up to that, and does the job! The linar note boast that some of their tunes are ""truly honky tonk"" is gen-u-ine bunky bunk...Honky tonk isn't even a distant cousin of wannabe line-dance sound. Texas produced Bob Wills, but this is GeoBush...nothin'butMuzak. Hush."
2,Edited,"Yami no Matsuei is a wonderful series. Ever since VIZ announced they had the rights I've wondered if they would edit it. Well on page 147 of Volume four they decided to. It's missing sound effects. As well as the head of one character on the bottom panel in order to obscure the sex scene. Why they decided to do this is a mystery considering the Teen+ parental advisory and other content in volume four and previous ones. So does it spoil the whole book? Any fans can make up their mind, but it certainly calls into question the authenticity of future volumes. Especially since there is more material VIZ may find questionable."
1,Did not receive item,"I ordered and paid for the item but didn't receive it, I contacted the seller and received no response, I had to submit a formal complaint to Amazon to get a refund and did not receive any correspondence from the seller. Not recommended"
1,50 CENT IS A FAKE PIMP AND GANGSTER!!!,"This guy is really making money off of alot of naive and ignorant people who buy anything which mtv shoves down their throats.He is all about image and no substance.He wishes he was a pimp and gangster,but hes a rich rapper who probably grew up in middle class suburbia.Did I mention that the song sucks bigtime."
1,50 ain't no damn pimp,50 should stick to the drug stories deserves 1 star really and yeah the best reason i would buy this is because of snoop who is the real star and showing 50 how players really spit game.
4,"Very effective as a cleaner, but with points to improve","This product has very strong suction power. you can also use it for effectively clean cars and curtains, rack, and etc. The attached tools work great, unlike some other brands which never really work on these side jobs.Problems or shortcomings if you would: very heavy and there is no comfortable way to carry it, especially when moving it up or down stairs, hard to empty and clean the dirt, and the manual is not vary clearly written about how to change the filter or fix problems.Some of the problems are obviously the cost of the strong power. Overall,it is still fair to say, this is a great cleaner."
1,Heavy vacuum,I am a strong young woman but this vacuum is way to heavy even for me.I can't even imagine how an older person can use it at all.I would not buy it again.
3,Heavy,Cleans well but it is so top heavy (dangerously falls over when vacuuming stairs or most times when using the hose) and is hard to push so I can not recommend for most friends and family.
2,Like dragging a shopping cart full of bricks,"My son has asthma, so I bought this thinking that I'd be able to clean all the surfaces in my house. It's got loads of attachments, but the problem is getting the thing where you need it. To say it's heavy is one whopper of an understatement. Since my house is carpeted upstairs only, that's where the thing lives. I've tried using it with the attachments on the stairs. but it tips over quite easily,so I find ways to keep it propped up. Assembly is easy if you have the right screwdriver for the job. I tried several, gave up for a few days, then lost the screw, so if you buy one, get that done ASAP. Also, if you're petite like I am, watch the cord. The suction is really strong, and since the thing is super heavy, it's easy to loose track of the cord and shred it. Exactly what I did. Also, the mini brush attachment on top falls off all the time. My home is not nearly as ""healthy"" as I thought it would be. Wok, wok"
4,like it,I really like the vaccuum. My only comment would be it is alittle heavy to carry up and down steps. It does a great job going from carpet to hardwoods with the easy no brush switch.
1,I feel obligated to review this vaccum! Beware!,I feel a strong obligation to review this vaccum...I hate it! I gave it a fair shot and told myself I could get past how damn heavy it is and how my back ached when I had to vaccum. Omitting that off the bat...we move onto how annoying it is that it works intermantently. Sometime it works in the suction department but the brush won't work...then I have to run it back and forth a few times and sometimes the brush will finally kick in and by that time my back is breaking from the heaviness of it. Then I get scared to turn it off if I have to move something out of the way to vaccum for fear of having to start the whole process over again. It is a nightmare...the worst vaccum ever. Don't buy it....trust me. I don't know how it got good reviews....seriously.
3,Bissell 5770 Vacuum,"Comments on Bissell 5770 VacuumMy remarks are qualified on the facts that I am of petite stature, am not strong, and live in a small two-story residence.I found this vacuum to be very difficult to use. It is top-heavy and quite awkward to use in a confined space. I live in a small two-story townhouse apartment. The hose doesn't extend far enough to get the top stairs clean. I couldn't possibly lift this machine to the second floor to clean those upper stairs. Therefore, I can only clean half of the staircase carpeting. When you try to empty the dirt from the cyclone, it will not come out. You have to dig it out by hand. I am an asthmatic. Digging in dirt is not something I should be doing. This really is not the machine for my needs.If a person is strong, possibly weighing 200 pounds, in good health, and live in a spacious residence, they might find this vacuum to be all it is advertised to be."
2,Just buy the dyson instead...,"good: great suction, lots of attachmentsbad: heavy, heavy, heavy, difficult to maneuver, cannot be easily cleaned and retains smells forever (used carpet refresher once an now i smell it every time i vacuum, which would be ok if i had liked the scent)I should have just bought the dyson in the first place - i could have saved the $250 i paid for this giant."
3,Bissel 5770,good price but does not do a perfect job. I need to go over my rug several times to pick up the crumbs and lint.
3,Cleans Well But Noisy and Can't Replace the Belt,"This vacuum did a great job in cleaning the carpet when we bought it. We have two dogs, so it definitely would get a workout when it was in use. Unfortunately, the belt on this broke after just a couple year's use and once that happens it's a dead vacuum - no repair belt. We purchased this back when it was $300, so that was a very expensive vacuum for only lasting a couple of years. I won't be buying another Bissell."
1,Too heavy & hard to manuever,"I really should have paid attention to the other reviews before I purchased this vacuum cleaner. It is VERY, VERY heavy and hard to manuever. I am fairly strong but have to ask my husband or son to carry it up and down the stairs. And vacuuming the stairs is a real chore, as you have to carry it up and down, which is nearly impossible. But after about a year of owning this vacuum, it finally bit the dust. It just stopped working. It appears to be an electrical issue, because if I shake the cord and move it around near the connection, it starts working. But I am all too glad, as I can now get rid of this vacuum and never buy a Bissell again."
2,"too heavy,&rips rugs","I just purchased this model 5770,first of all its not the same color as shown on Amazon.Does not work well on ceramic tile,half the time it spits out what your trying to vacuum, it has pulled the threads out of my expensive jute rug.The company ""Evive""would only take it back after they charged me a 20%restock fee and I pay shipping.Not a good company to purchase online merchandise,stay away from them.Poor customer service."
3,Bissell5770,"This turned out not to be the best vacuum cleaner for my needs. It does not pick up pet (cat) hair at all well. It is somewhat hard to move from rug to bare floor (I have area rugs). On the plus side, it really deep cleans rugs. I like that it is bagless and easy to empty. With the HEPA filter, the air in my home smells fresher."
4,Does a good job on both carpet and hardwood floors,Only con is that it is heavy. The attachments are very well engineered and don't fall off like other vacuums. The hand attachment works wonders.
4,Very Powerful but a lot of weight,"This vacuum has great suction and even does well on hard surfaces. The hose has plenty of length and the roller brush for the hose is an awesome feature. The vacuum also does a great job of containing all the dust when vacuuming so no more dusty odors when vacuuming.Overall I would completely recommend this vacuum. Men, just be prepared to haul it around the house for your wife."
3,Great on carpets; terrible on floors,"There is actually a great disparity between the suction you get from the hose and the unit as a whole. We tried playing with the connection, checking just about everything, but the suction through the brush-area of the unit is very low, perhaps lending to its poor performance on hard floors. The brush action is the reason for the great performance on the carpets, but on the floors the brush just kicks everything out the back of the unit. There is an option to turn the brush off, but then it doesn't pick anything up on the floors because of the poor suction. So realize when you get this you will likely need a different unit specifically for floors, but this does work very well on carpets."
3,very heavy,"This product works very well and has alot of suction. Unfortunately, I would have never purchased it if I had known it was so heavy. Hard to push when it has so much weight. Convenient cleanout and nice not to have the bags to dispose of. Wide (15"") coverage for rug cleaning is also a good feature.Bissell 5770 Healthy Home Bagless Upright Vacuum"
4,"Old, but still working","We bought this vacuum roughly 7 years ago. We paid quite a bit more then what amazon has it listed now, but not the price of a dyson. We have recently broken a few parts on it, but it keeps running. We have hardwood floors and a shag rug(which I vacuum). It's beginning to not have the suction that it used to, but please understand that we are VERY rough on our vacuums. We do have to clean it more often now that it is older, but it has vaccumed pretty much everything in our house from litter, dirt, leaves, toys, cat hair, food, tags, glass, and maple syrup. My biggest complaint is the weight. I like to vacuum our two level home several times a day; the weight of the vacuum makes this a bit tiring. I hope this helps. I wish this type of vacuum was in canister form."
4,Great!,This vaccum is really good but a bit heavy! it's really hard to lug it up stairs than back down! but it does do a great job and nothing bad as happened yet and going on a couple months of using it.
1,Not for the frequent vaccuumer,I recently replaced my Dyson with the Bissell 5770. I loved my Dyson but accidently ruined it. My sister raved about her Bissell and after reading the great reviews I decided to give it a try. I must say I hated the vaccuum from Day 1. The tank is a nightmare to empty because it tapers at the bottom where the dirt comes out. It is extremely hard to push because it is manually adjusted. If it is adjusted to pick up dirt correctly it gives you a gymnastic workout. If it is adjusted to push/pull easily it doesn't pick up the dirt or pethair. The attachments fall off and break apart. They have to be reassembled which is no easy task. It is extremely loud. I could not get mine to turn on (sometimes it started and sometimes it didn't) so I was forced to run to the store and buy another Dyson. I salvaged the loose items for my sister because hers already broke too. I'm at a loss as to why this vaccuum is so popular.
4,4 stars from me!!!!,"I recently bought this vacuum and I love it.Pros:*The attachments are great.*Suction is strong*Canister is easy to empty*There are various carpet settings instead of just 2 or 3. This is a nice feature beacuse if you have a room with newer carpet then the higher settings are what you would use and if you have a room with older carpeting it will most likely be more worn and lower.*You can go from carpet to floor with the push of button as the rotating brush switch is right at your fingertip.Cons:*The vacuum is very heavy. But think of it as a work out.*And although I really like the fact that the rotating brush switch is at the top of the vacuum it is right by the handle so it's easy to push it off while your vacuuming. (but it's easy to switch it right back on too)*The vacuum will tumble if your stretching the hose to far, but I've had this problem with numerous vacuums.I definitely recommend this vacuum. But if your looking for something light weight this isn't the one for you."
4,Bissell 5770 Healthy Home Bagless Upright,"This vacuum SUCKS!!! In the BEST WAY POSSIBLE. This vacuum was given to me by my mother in law because she said it was to heavy for her and difficult to handle. This would be the only drawback to this vacuum! I'm not going to get into all the other details you can read the other reviews. I consider myself to be a very clean person, I vacuum the main living rooms everyday, ie. family room, kitchen and mudroom area. When I cleaned these rooms with the new Bissell I had to unload the canister (simple and easy) 3 times! My family was shocked at what it picked up. I could never figure out why I had to windex the table tops every day. I had tried my sister-in=laws Dyson and was not impressed. I would absolutely recommend this vacuum. I would give this 5 stars but it is quite heavy. I decided to look at this the same as a previous reviewer, it is now a piece of workout equipment that happens to clean the house!!!"
1,Bissell won't be getting my business again.,"This thing was great in the beginning. Honestly one of the more powerful vacs I have owned and I loved the bag-less feature. Then after a year of (no-pets) use the ""LIFETIME"" belt broke. I mean, COME ON, anyone who has ever OWNED a vacuum has changed the belt several dozen times within it's lifetime.THIS MACHINE DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO CHANGE THE BELT. (WTF?!?) and Good luck finding a repairman. Besides, the ""repair"" is more expensive and time consuming than ordering a new one ""NEXT DAY"".I give this product an F. A pricey piece of designed obsolescence AKA garbage to add to the growing overflow of a throw-away culture.@#$* you Bissell... you won't be getting my business again."
3,Wow and Wow,Bissell 5770 Healthy Home Bagless Upright VacuumWow does this vacuum do a good job. Rather embarrasing to think of all the dirt that was in my carpet. Wow is this thing heavy. I would definitely not recommend it for women. You can test in in the store but doubtful you'll be able to test it on carpet where the weight really is noticable. The cannister is poorly designed and pops off regularly. Easy enough to snap back on but rather annoying. The turbo brush pops off regularly as well - just a poor design. The turbo brush is excellent for stairs - shame the vacuum is so heavy to lug on the stairs. The extension cord is nice and long. I guess the weight is the price for the impressive power and results. Make sure the place you buy it has a good return policy just in case it's not for you. Overall recommended but be aware of the flaws.
3,vacuum,We like many features of this product but were surprised at how heavy it is. We should have tried it out first. We do like how effective it is in picking up dirt and being able to adjust to hard floors also.
4,Bissell Healthy Home Vacuum,"It's a great vacuum. Quick assembly, super easy to empty and is nice and quiet (for a vacuum anyway). Would highly recommend if your in the market for a new one."
4,Cleans Great!,"This vacuum works great! I had read all the other reviews and agree that it is slightly heavy if you have to move it up and down stairs but if you have a one-floor home-it's no big deal at all. It's cleaning power is fantastic- at my work place we have dyson and I think this works 10x's better and it's 1/2 the cost. The only down side (and this is probably true of any bagless vacuum) is that the containter reaches it's max quickly and then emptying it out is kind of a dusty process that you want to do outdoors in my opinion. I found it easy to operation (removing canister, etc)- just a somewhat dirty job!"
5,WOW,"This vacuum is everything it promises. Great power, great style. It is a bit on the heavy side, so probably not for elderly folks if they have more than a one level home. I love the small beater-brush attachment for doing stairs."
3,"Started out great, ended up poorly...","We have 2 Bissel Healthy Home vacuums; my husband purchased a 2nd during our separation, now we're back and own 2. Both performed extremely well in the first few months of ownership but we've experienced identical issues with both. First issue power switch not turning on. On occasion we found if the canister was not setting correctly on the base the vacuum wouldn't turn on. We've tried everything, taking the machine apart etc and the 2nd vacuum will not power on. The 2nd issue has been the brush not rotating. Sometimes if you bump the corner of the brush head, the brush will cease rotating. Why this is so remains a mystery and how it suddenly begins to rotate again, well, that's another mystery.At the present time we have 1 vacuum that will not turn on and the other turns on the the brush is fickle about rotating.Very frustrating. Think I may drag out the heavy Kirby vacuum, get it tuned and performing again. Sigh..thought I was finished with vacuum bags."
4,Great Vacuum,"I just bought my second Healthy Home Vacuum. Had the first one for about seven years, then my daughter broke it (it didn't konk on it's own). So, did my homework, was tempted by the Dyson, and still ended up with the Bissell Healthy Home vacuum. It really is a great vacuum and I agree with the other reviewers regarding the weight and the awkward dirt container. With that said, I don't have a problem emptying the awkward container because it's so much better than dealing with a bag. There's a trade off and you cannot get away from dust disposal....it's a vacuum!Other than those two items, it works well in my home with three kids, two cats, and a dog. I like this vacuum above all others because it's a beast when it comes to cleaning and the hepa filter traps the usual particles that other vacuums leave unsettled. It's also affordably priced when compared to other vacuums (got it for a great price at Kohl's)."
2,Buyer Beware,"Needed a new vacuum and lots of great reviews for this one. My experience just didn't seam quite as good. We got the first unit home and there were parts missing. You have to put the handle and Cord storage pieces on your self. The item didn't have any screws to do this so I took that one back for a new one. The new one did come with the screws but the brush would only work for about 30 seconds then stop. If you waited a few minutes, it would start working again. When it did work, it worked like a charm but I can't stop every 30 seconds to wait 2 minutes... I don't know if it overheated or was faulty but it would work and then, out of no where, stop. So, third time's a charm, I went back and got one more. The last one, the brush switch wouldn't turn off the brush. By now, I've had it. I took the last one in and just got the Dyson DC25 Animal. Hasn't stopped working... yet..."
2,Great cleaner but cheaply made,"I have had one of these for a little over a year now and the cleaning performance is fantastic, much better than our previous Vax. However, the brushes stopped working recently so I ordered a replacement brush motor. When I took the thing to bits it was all rusty inside and more annoyingly the sprocket on the end of the brush motor was rusted onto the old non-working motor and I couldn't remove it at all. I tried WD40, pullers and even a hammer. I hate being beaten when repairing things and this beat me. For the dozen or so times that it cleaned the carpet it did a great job, but I'm not pleased with the build quality at all."
2,Messy Clean Up,This unit was extremely heavy. It did vacuum well but the clean up was awful. When emptying the canister the dirt and dust would spill on the floor causing me to either vacuum or sweep it back up. I would empty the canister while holding it down inside of the trashcan but dust would inevitably fly out. I retured the machine after 3 uses.
1,Fragile piece of crap,"Worst vacuum ever! Had it a year and have hated it almost every day. Plastic is weak- the canister bottom broke off after two months and the front top latch followed a month later. Cleaning power is worst than the 20 year old Hoover I had years ago. Pet hair? Forget about it. Save yourself some time and use a lint brush on the carpet. The ""turbo brush"" attachment is even more useless than the vacuum itself. If I wanted to tickle my dog, then, and only then, it would have a job it could handle.Too bad there's not a 'no star"" rating. This thing deserves it."
2,damaged in shipping,Product was damaged in shipping. Dealer was quick to issue refund and pay return shipping
1,Bissell 5770 Upright Vacuum,The vacuum was defective when I received it. It had no suction and then wouldn't even turn on. I sent it back to Bissell and they sent me a new one. Nancy J Harris
3,"It Broke But can Suck, Literally!","Firstly, this vacuum cleaner sucks, and I mean that literally. The sucking strength is fantastic. There is no doubt that this thing will get the dander out of your carpet and even give you a hickey if you put it to your skin! We have birds and let me tell ya it cleans up the molting etc well! However, and this is secondly, two days ago, after owning this vacuum cleaner for 88 days (still within my 90 day return warranty at K-mart thank God), for some weird reason the brush would not turn on except when I put the handle in the lowest position. Yes, that sucks figuratively speaking! Another negative is the fact that my hands would always hit the buttons on the handle turning it off in the middle of vaccuming. I just couldn't go without it apparently, so I bought another one with a supplemental warranty (4 yr Best Buy), of course upon my wife's ""advice"" - not really she made me!"
3,Bissell 5770 Healthy Home Bagless Upright Vacuum,"Received this for the holidays. Great vacuum but VERY HEAVY!!! Awkward to use when you have to lug up and down the stairs. Great and useful attachments, great suction. First was tricky to empty container of debris. Front top attachment of rotating brush pops off seemingly at will when moving vaccum around. Have not used the anti-mite spray yet. Pretty good on wood floors."
1,Can't carry this filthy machine,"Right off the bat, there's no carrying handle for this machine. Are you supposed to lift the whole thing by the dirt canister? I can just see the plastic parts breaking off.Next, it just doesn't suck. The suction is weak, and the brush is difficult to clean and remove wound on fibers (pet hair, etc). Do NOT use this if you've just replaced your carpet - all those fibers will completely clong the brush.Last, the canister has to be removed and taken apart to get pet hair out - the open the bottom you see in the commercials drops the dirt, but not the hair. Even then, you end up with dirt on the outside of the canister - kind of pointless.Do NOT buy this product."
1,Way to HEAVY,I purchased this unit after reading the great reviews even though some did mention how heavy this unit was. After trying it out I realized there was no way I could push this around without damaging all of my base boards in my house. I sent it back. Thanks Amazon for your great return process.
1,Horrible Overpriced Piece of Junk,"I bought this vacuum to replace a ""bottom of the barrel"" vacuum that had given out after 5 years of constant use. Two months after purchasing the vacuum we decided to rip out the carpet and do hardwood floors. It was occasionally used to do bedrooms over the next year. From the start I disliked it because it would just push Cheerio's and crackers around the floor. I had to physically pick up the Cheerio's off the floor and throw them away. I've probably said 2 swear words in my entire life and now everytime I attempt to vacuum I want to curse like a sailor because the darn brush won't turn on. Don't buy it."
3,Great suction but broke after a year of use,"I loved this vacuum cleaner, it had awesome suction until the day it died and went through heavy use for a year. I have 3 dogs and 1 long haired cat plus a toddler. I used it for a 2-story house, top floor is all carpet and bottom floor is laminate. I loved that I could shut the brushes off and use it on the laminate and it did a great job. It is extremley heavy though and hard to use on area rugs, I did it but I got a work out every time. I would still have this vacuum if it hadn't broken. The brushes stopped working completely and it would turn off and on as you were using it. I think there is a short in the handle where both switches are located. I spent almost $300 on this vacuum last July and for that money, I would expect it to last longer then it did. I am very disappointed and plan on purchasing a Dyson Animal since I am tired of buying a new vacuum every year."
4,Great vac.,"Not super quiet, but a lot quieter than the old one - and the sound it makes speaks to quality - no odd noises, squeaks or such.On top of that it just works great. Strongest vac we have ever had. A little heavier than we might have liked, but with all it has going for it and the quality build, the bit extra weight is to be expected. Give it a 4 1/2.PS. In principle works like a Dyson - very strong never ending suction ..but would much rather have the Bissell than the Dyson my sis-in-law paid lots more for."
3,"Great Suction, Bad durability","I owned this vacuum for 2 years before the motor broke down on me. I was really upset because up until this time it had incredible suction, though it ought to weighing in at 26 lbs! I would not recommend this to people who have a 2 story house cause it's terrible carrying up and down stairs. It was a great vacuum, but for 300$ I would have expected it to last longer. I bought a refurbished Hoover windtunnel from Big Lots for $80 and I feel like I am getting the same clean. I would definitely rethink my purchase if I could do it all over again."
3,Average Vacuum,"When I was looking for a replacement for my great old Hoover I had for years, the Bissell Healthy Home was rated very high. Since I have a multiple pet household I was torn between the Bissell and the Dyson. I could not see paying that much for a Dyson so I bought the Bissell. It was great for the first couple of months, after that, it is no better or worse than any other vacuum.My one major complaint about this vacuum is it does not have a well balanced design and falls over backwards if I stretch the hose out any distance. I am not talking about stretched to the max, but just past the normal length.Overall it is about average and I will not buy a Bissell in the future."
1,NO NO NO!,"Cons:1) Heavy heavy vacuum!2) Inconveniently located 'power' button on the top of the handle and when I had to push this heavy heavy vacuum I had to use two hands and would constantly accidentally push the power button3) Also has a 'brush' button that you have to push in order for the brush to turn on! (which I didn't see until after I finished vacuuming the living room and wondered why I couldn't see it rotating through the see-through window. Then one of the times I pushed that stupid 'power' button, I saw the 'brush' button below it)4) Does not suck that well. I've read the other reviews and mine just did not suck that good. I vacuumed my carpets, then used my carpet cleaner and it was disgusting how much dirt and hair it picked up that the Bissell didn't.Pros:1) Long cord2) its bagless3) pretty?Honestly there's too many cons than pros and I would NOT recomment this vacuum. It went back to the store the next day and now Im going for the Dyson. I'll let you know how that goes!"
2,This vacuum sucks!,The only good thing about this vacuum is it's amazing suction power. It really does suck!Edge cleaning is non-exisitent. The wand accessory can only pick up small dust bunnies. Anything else overpowers it and you can get hurt when it does a kick back.It is also very top heavy and often falls over. Be careful of your toes and any other body parts that get in the way.Cannot handle dog hair and gets clogged.The canister is diffucult to empty. Be sure to take it outsideto empty it or you will have a huge mess to vacuum up again.We bought this vacuum instead of the Dyson because of price and the good reviews we read. Don't make the same mistake we did!
2,very heavy and can ruin some area rugs,"this vacuum seriously is a tank. unless you are a bodybuilder, you may want to consider another choice. it also ruined a 400.00 area rug by sucking out a majority of the fibers on the first sweep. the rug was only 3 years old and hardly ever walked on. the height adjustments are very minimal as well."
1,Not reliable at all,"We purchased this vacuum a year ago and have had nothing but problems with it. The brush will stop turning for no reason. After two not covered under our warranty trips to a repair shop and one ""it just magically started working"" fixes later, it quit working again. I followed the tips online to try to make it work, but nothing seems to help.Finally, I pulled a Jimi Hendrix and smashed it on the ground out of frustration. Avoid this machine at all costs."
1,Big Disappointment,"I bought this vacuum probably 2 years ago. I paid nearly $300 but I was very happy...AT FIRST. For the first year things were good. My complaints were that it was quite heavy and often tipped over (usually hitting me in the back) when I used the attachments. The canister was also a little messy to empty. But it really did a great job cleaning. And then it started to fall apart. First the brush seized up & would not rotate. It has some kind of internal belt, that cannot be changed like the standard vacs. I had to pay $40 to buy a new brush and spend hours taking the thing apart and putting it all back together. A month later the self propel feature stopped working. Not the end of the world. But then the canister started falling apart piece by piece. And now the think is ducked taped and bungee strapped together while I shop for my next vac. The only thing I can guarantee is that I wont be purchasing another Bissell product."
2,Good when it is not broken.,"This did great job while it worked. Suction was good, and it cleaned well, but the canister design was terrible. Had to really work to empty it. As far as malfunctions, First we had to replace the handle because the on off button wasnt working. Next the hose ripped and we were sent a replacement. Finally the brush started making funny sounds and smelling really bad, was told by Bissell that we would need to take it to an authorized dealer. We were not too into travelling far distances to make this happen so we just bought a Dyson."
2,"Good power, but breaks down!","I was amazed at the amount of hair and dirt this vacuum picks up! However, I've had to take it in for service twice now and it's cost me $75 each time! I've had the vacuum for about three years. The first breakdown was the result of a clog, which ended up burning out the motor. Now, the brush bar was bent and needs to be replaced! I wish I could upgrade or get money back from Bissel.P.S. I don't have a problem with the weight. The problem I have is when it falls over when I use the hose - annoying. Also, it's very difficult to clean."
2,Bad Circuit Board,"I researched and bought this vacuum about a year ago. It worked like a champ till this weekend when suddenly the brush stopped turning and it wouldln't suck from the bottom. Using the the hose was fine. The problem according to the fix-it shop? This vacuum has a cheap circuit board that has gone bad. Cost to replace $100+. What vacuum needs a circuit board? (The motor and belt are fine.)Sorry that I bought it now. It's junk. Fom now on, I'll be asking wheter any vacuum has this expensive and useless component."
3,Good for 2.5 yrs,"I loved this vacuum when first purchased 3 years ago. I had just bought a townhouse where the previous owners had a few cats. This vacuum helped me to survive and breathe! It worked well with pick up, etc...for about 2 years. Now it's the worse. I have a short haired dog and it does little to pick up the hair. The bagless feature is gross, because it doesn't just ""fall out"" of the canister. You have to dig for the dirt/hair, etc. It's also very heavy. It's a pain to clean the filters as well. I'm looking for a new one, because I don't think this one lived up to its reputation."
2,HEAVY VACUUM,I recently purchased this vacuum and it is extremely heavy. I have two dogs and the pet hair does not come out of the disposal tank when you release the contents. I was amazed at the power and suction of this machine - it did pick everything up.
5,WOW,I love my new vacuumn. It amazes me how much dirt comes up when I vacumn. I love the attachment allowing me to EASILY vacumn stairs and furniture and to clean the inside of my car.
1,Piece of garbage,"We have owned this monster for over a year and I have longed for my Oreck every day since. It weighs a ton. Forget about this one if you have stairs. The height adjustment is a pain in the butt also. If you want to empty the thing be sure you do it outside. Bagless is a good idea, but when you open the cannister and shake it out, you will look like Charlie Brown's friend, Pigpen, in no time. The dust and dirt is everywhere. The onboard tools are clunky and add to the bulk. Do yourself a favor and buy an Oreck."
4,"Wow, this thing is great!!!","I'll keep it short....We vacuumed with our old vacuum...then with this one. The dirt collector had nearly three inches of stuff in there! Nasty...Also, it beat life back into our carpet. I havent felt it so springy in a long time. It's been a few days and I can still feel the difference.The upholstery attachment works great. Used it on the couch...All I can say is, ewwwe.It's half as loud as our old one...but nearly three times as heavy.Don't let kids play with it, the hose could suck out an eye-ball it's that strong.At $30+ for the replacment filter, don't plan on saving money on bags.Great vacuum, glad I bought it."
2,"Hard to push, horrible to unload","We've owned this vacuum for about a year. The unit is very difficult to push around the house. We have a low pile carpet throughout. It does suck well, but has no power drive, it is heavy, and generally miserable to use.What's worse is when we empty the canister, there is no way to avoid getting the mess all over you. Worst vacuum we have ever owned."
3,mediocre for the price,"I have had this vacuum for about 3 years and it is about to find its way to the curb. While the suction is good and the attachments are easy to use, it is much heavier than many vacuums, therefore a pain to haul up and down stairs. It also doesn't pick up small clumps of mud or leaves from bare floor surfaces...instead, it tends to kick dirt back onto me - oh fun. Most annoyingly, the top part of the handle only clicks to connect to the main vacuum body...if it becomes at all dislodged, you have to fiddle with it until it is fully connected in order to use the dang thing. I am tired of constantly cleaning the HEPA filter and all of this vacuum's little annoyances. I think I'm going to go buy a cheaper vacuum...my old Eureka did better than this Bissell."
3,Great vacuum. A little too heavy.,"we had a Bissel Lift-Off for 5 years prior to this one. Was a great vacuum, but it's time had come. After much research, this Vacuum fit our needs and our price range. It also comes with a 5 year warranty.I was so excited to get it b/c it had been 2 weeks since I last vacuumed!!!I found that it did a great job. Amazing. A little too heavy to push around. takes effort. Not like my old vacuum which would practically guide itself.Also I found it annoying when emotying the cannister. I found that dust would spill out all over the place. And dust/dirt would get stuck at the top. I need to stick my hand up there to pull it out, which I find to be gross.All in all It's a pretty good vacuum. We actually need to send ours back b/c it's making some weird noises. But hey, There is always one or two that are problematic"
3,Cleaner than ever!,"I did a little research before selecting this vacuum cleaner. Many of the reviews said the vacuum was heavy. I purchased anyway because of the reports that it performed so well in cleaning. As it turns out, I agree completely with everything I have read. It IS a heavy vacuum. If this is a concern, this is not the vacuum for you. Also, because it is heavy, I sometimes need to use an extra hand on the front of the handle, which sometimes knocks the attachment off of its holder. I'm sure I will adapt to that in time. I considered returning it, but in the end I decided that my carpets have never been so clean. The suction is very powerful with the attachments as well, which is not always the case with other vacuums. I get a lot of satisfaction out of vacuuming with this model."
4,"GREAT vacuum, but HEAVY!","We bought this vacuum because it was cheaper than a Dyson, and got really good reviews. It cleans REALLY well. I cannot get over how well actually. And I LOVE that the cord is so long I can plug it into one room (central) and do every room on the same level of the house without ever having to unplug it. I like the rubber edging, great for banging it into corners and walls. lol My only complaints with it are that it is extremely heavy, and it didn't come with a crevice tool. The replacement filters are also a little pricey."
4,"Great suction, but...","I have owned this product for around six months. Great suction, handy tools, ease of emptying the canister. So why the ""but..."", two things. One, the button to turn on the beater is right by the power button. I keep turning the unit off instead of turning on/off the beater. Two, the beater stops working occasionally. I just spoke to a service rep and seems this is a common condition. It is due to faulty instructions when putting together the vacuum. The handle gets offset and poof, no more beater. Just realign, reattach the handle. I would recommend this vacuum even so. Overall, a great value."
4,Excellent Vacuum,I'll admit it. I'm a little overzealous about vacuuming. I have a couple cats who shed constantly so I am usually forced to vacuum a couple times a week. I had a much cheaper vacuum for a while and it wore out after a couple years and was so loud I had to wear ear plugs when I used it.This vacuum has severed me very well. Emptying it is a snap and the accessories are more than adequate for the cleaning of my large apartment.
4,does good job,"This product is fantistic, it is quiet and does a good job of getting up anything in your carpet. The hepa filter keeps particals from getting in the air and creating a breathing problem. Remember to read the directions, my daughter didn't and ended up sweating and pushing the machine, wishing it was self-propelled. She emptied the bagless drum and was amazed at the dirt and hair it had picked up. She accidentley touched a button on the handle and it took of with her. Needless to say she made a very happy with the discoverery."
1,Avoid this vacuum!,I have had this vacuum for less than a year and it has not been a good vacuum. The first issue I had was that the handle does not stay together tight enough so often the machine shuts off. When I called bissell they said it was a common problem I just had to hold the handle together as I vacuumed to maintain the connection. Ridiculous solution! Now after less than a year when it does turn on the suction is terrible. I hate that I spent so much money on such a poor quality appliance!
3,what was the BBC thinking?,"It is well documented that the thin murky production on this infuriated the band upon this disc's release, and they were right to be angry. It almost seems like a cheap attempt to cash in on RAW MELODY MEN. If you can muddle through the bad sound, it's easy to see that this is not because of the band's performance: NMA are as tight as ever, and the quality of the music itself isn't lacking.This one, like the previous review says, is only for the collector, mainly for the live tracks here that do not appear on RAW MELODY MEN. Those looking for live NMA would do much much better to start with ...& NOBODY ELSE, and then go to RAW MELODY MEN."
3,Sadly underrated band who scream originality,"Although this live recording doesn't do as much justice as it could (ever heard that before?), Lone Star were a superb band who achieved power, imagry and emotion on both their albums, 'Lone Sar' and 'Firing on all six' and most of this is in evidence on 'In Concert'. They did unfortunately occur at a time where fashion ignored them but as we become more retrospective by the generation, perhaps they will now be recognised as a band that could have developed to champion the heavy rock genre as others fell by the wayside. To hear is to believe and this reviewer strongly recommends that you do both, not least to the studio albums - they certainly rest in my top ten."
1,Cheap Junk,These inverters are unreliable made in China crud. Try Die Hard from Sears. I've had zero failures on the Die Hards.
5,Couldn't Get it Off My Player,"The first single, ""I Don't Care What You Call Me,"" is one of the best songs I've heard in ages. And the rest of the album not only hooked me fast, but has held onto me for weeks. I almost have to ration myself so I don't overplay it. Hasn't happened so far, though. I love the emotion Mr. Ford brings through his voice, melodies and especially the vocal harmonies. The entire production of this album is first rate."
3,Not up to David's live shows,"Live, David Ford is amazing to watch. His solo loop delivery is amazing, compelling, and, at times, breathtaking. After seeing him twice opening for Gomez, I just had to buy his album.Unfortunately, the studio David Ford is just missing that freedom, that passion, that, I don't, something. That's the only word I can think of. It's missing that something.I would pay to watch David Ford perform live a hundred times. I listened to this album three or four times, and I'm done. Sorry, David, the album just doesn't come close to your abilities as an artist and just can't capture your live show."
3,Blah,"This program has TOO MUCH content for anyone. If you have alot of time to read through all the text, I suppose it is allright. I prefer the fifteen to twenty dollar software over this program. I learned more in a week with the cheaper software than It would have taken me to learn in 3 months with this software. I would recommend it as a reference, but not as a learning tool. I tired pretty easy with all the reading (not to mention bored). Buy something cheaper, and learn alot faster. I think the depth is too much."
1,"0 STARS , ACTUALLY","COMPLETE AND UTTER TRASH ; CHEESY , LOW BUDGET , INACCURATE; A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY , EVEN WORSE THAN THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC"" BEYOND THE MOVIE "" AND THE HISTORY CHANNEL'S "" ALEXANDER THE GREAT"". READ ROBIN LANE FOX'S BIOGRAPHY OR MARY RENAULT'S "" THE NATURE OF ALEXANDER""."
2,ALEXANDER THE GREAT 2004 WHERE ARE YOU IN DVD,"first this is not the real film ""ALEXANDER THE GREAT"" thatI saw at the cinema in october. this film is a documentaryI want to buy the DVD of the real Movie with GORAN VISNJIC ASALEXANDER"
4,Good introduction to the world of government standards,"While this book contains a good overview of government documentation standards and how they benefit the development of software, there is a lack of examples of a complete document. This book is certainly no match for the actual documentation standards provided by the dod, but for a great start in generating documentation standards, this book is it."
2,I used to like the song,"I give Limp the respect for ""trying"" to cover one of the best Jane's Addiction songs to come out, but hey guys.....THIS SUCKED!! This turned out to be an ode to noone. Sorry, but I hope the new album rocks better than this song. LOL :)"
5,"Excellent Compilation, Excellent Pianist","A superb compilation of high-energy, technically challenging pieces played with immaculate precision and unparalleled sensitivity by the greatest American pianist, Leonard Pennario. Recordings are all from the 1960s."
5,Fabulous and educational!!,My 5 year old son was on the edge of the bed in suspence with the story and in fascination by the wonderful pictures that brought the story to life. Great to learn about an old Korean tradition that I think is interesting to all age levels. Once again Julie Downing did such a fabulous job with her illustrations!!!
5,What a Beautiful Read!,"The book is so interesting, so informative, and so gorgeous. Also, my kids enjoyed comparing the fires on the mountains to their favorite fantasy, LORD OF THE RINGS. The tie-in made it even batter for them.Well done, Ms. Park, and while I am here, let me say, KEOKO is my other favorite of yours."
5,Great kit for the price,"We are very happy with this.Long pole which is adjustable and 2 ends, one net for scimming off the top and a vacuum head for the floor.Plastic is kinda chepa but it did not break on us this eason. Just connect to hose, turn on and that's it. Clean away.I would buy this again if it does break. Easy to use and efficient."
2,It's ok...,the product came as described by the seller however it puts to much water back into your pool and it does not suck out algae.. And that's why most people purchase a vacuum for the pool so if you're looking to clear up algae I do not recommend this product I would recommend 1 that hooks up directly into your pool pump filter system.. if you're just looking for something to pick up leaves of the bottom of your pool it's a great product.. the only thing is the little cheese cloth bag doesn't do a good job on its own so you would need to add some nylon pantyhose to that as well.
4,Intex Pool cleaner Kit,"Works really well-I have used this pool sweeper several times now. It picks up the debri off the bottom of the pool, has a great reach and adds water to my pool as I clean it. Simply hook up a water hose, turn it on and it works. The debri bag works fine."
4,It works,"I don't know how or why, but it works. It doesn't cover a very big area at once...but does the job! Thanks!"
2,Works a little bit,"While this does get some of the leaves and debris, it is very slow and doesn't do a complete job. I can go over the same debris several times and it doesn't always pick it up. I'm going to have to get a ""real"" vacuum."
3,Pretty Good,"We have a 12 foot round above ground Intex pool and the net and vaccuum work good. It helps to keep the pool clean. The only drawback is that the vaccuum can be aggravating at times as it doesn't always suck up all the junk. For the price, it does the job though."
3,not really a vacuum,"The net and pole are useful,however note this is not a vacuum, you attach a garden hose to the end and the hose water swirls the debris into the attached net. (not good for pools that acquire a lot of sand.)Also note the description says ""a pool maintenance kit"" It never implies it is a vacuum, I am pleased I got what I ordered, and in a timely fashion."
5,Surprisingly Hot and passionate to the last line,Surprised I was when I began to read.This book is all that and some.It was just what the title read and hotter.He is a wonderful writer.He could teach a man everything he needs to know when it comes to pleasing a woman.The sex the love and the poetry in this book is sure to open eyes of woman all across the world.I'm going purchase books for all the women in my family as well as my friends.When you start the first page you can't stop its what I would call good to the last drop.............
2,"Nice Songs, But The Cue In Stinks!","I needed the Spongebob theme song for a birthday party, so I bought this disc. There is NO cue-in for the song! You can't say the, ""Are you ready kids?"" part because the music just blasts in! It was so frustrating that I ended up not using the CD at all. It was a waste of money!"
3,storage concerns,not sure best storage...rusts when dried and stored. Seemed to last longer stored in container with distilled water. Works well till rusting starts then its hard to know if its the element or body that is producing flecks
1,Not so pleasant.,"I listen just before I fall asleep, Wonderful sea sounds and all of the sudden a wave crashes and the volume is so high it startles you out of your trance and your heart is racing."
3,good product but misleading photo,The flap Wheel works well but the picture is misleading it shows 5 pack in the picture but you only get one.
4,GTAW review,Required text book for class. This book is informative and easy to read. End of chapter questions allowed me to test information learned after reading each chapter.
5,Excellent,"I inherited one of these from my grandfather. It still holds up to abuse well, and has a very smooth ratcheting mechanism."
3,All City's Debut Solid But Shaky At Some Times,"All City shook everyone with ""Metrotheme"" in '97 and since then we've been awaiting the debut. Well here it is. The major highlights are Primo fueled ""The Actual"" which is probably the hottest joint on the album. Also ""Priceless"" produced by Pete Rock tells about how All City is out for the fortune like the wheel. Clark Kent gets in the mix on the remix of ""The Hot Joint"". Other notable trackes are ""Live It Up"" and ""Daydreaming"". Unfortunatly it falls of on tracks like ""Get Paid"" and ""Favorite Things"" just make you ill from listening to all that talk about money. I say get rid of fallen off rappers like Onyx and get with Primo and Pete Rock for more tracks. They have great potential, they gotta learn how to use it."
5,"I'm sure if it were sung in english, I'd hate it","Japanese singing is cool to listen to. It is an elegant language that sounds really good in combination with the synthesized pop style..(not synth pop mind you, but keyboard drums and all). I am sure that if it were done in english, I would look at it the same way I look at britney spears..."
3,Oval mirror with black shelf,"I have no problem with the mirror. Have not even opened it. Purchased as a gift for my granddaughter and she changed her mind and did not want. So called VisionDecor three times to arrange return and get return address. No humans there but a promise to return my call within 24 hours. My three calls never returned. Called Amazon.com and they took care of me as their customer. THANX, Amazon. Boo to VisionDecor."
4,I'm Liking The Wireless Cycle Computer,"My previous CatEye cycle computer met its demise when the wire wrapping came loose on a long down hill stretch. The wire got caught in the front wheel and was severed. After a futile attempt to splice the wire back together, I bought the new CatEye wireless model.The installation instructions were a little tricky, but I was up and running in about 30 minutes. So far, I'm enjoying the wireless aspects of this cycle computer. All of the data collection modes are working... I just need to get used to using all of them. This is a big step up from my prior basic computer. I have put the instructions in plastic bag and put them in my on board carry bag for future reference.I hope that the battery life between the sender and receiver hardware lasts a good long time..."
5,Great Tool for your bike,I bought my son one for his birthday. Liked it so much that I ordered one for myself. It has everything you need when riding and very easy to read and/or change modes.
3,"Dead batteries, poor instructions","I have no big problem with the computer itself, but it arrived with one of the two batteries dead and the other close to death. My other complaint is with the instructions. I'm a fairly intelligent person, yet I struggled with the diagram before I figured out the start-up programming. Is it too much to ask that we get instructions with at least a few complete sentences?"
5,Works Great,"I've only had the bicycle computer for a couple of weeks, but although the installation instructions are kind of vague, the computer works well. It mounts with double sided tape and cable ties, so it tends to move around instead of being clamped solidly to the handle bar."
4,"Works well, except for two problems","This computer is easy to install and it works as advertised. It seems to be pretty accurate when I compare it to other people's computers on group rides. There are two problems though:1. My city has a lot of sensors built into roads to trigger traffic lights. The computer sometimes picks up interference from these sensors and goes wacky--once it listed my speed at 64 m.p.h. while I was stopped at a red light! This can be annoying because it messes up your average speed calcuation.2. The light feature is worthless, so don't let that be the deciding factor when choosing a computer. The button is hard to access (nearly impossible while riding), it hardly illuminates the display so you can just barely see your speed, and it stays on for just a few seconds so you'll have to keep turning it on if you want to see average speed, trip time, etc."
4,Cateye Micro Wireless CC-MC100W,I have a foldable bike so wireless becomes more important with less chance of breaking wires. This Cateye seems to work very nicely. The mountings are simple and don't require excessive space. Setup was easy. Operation is a no brainer. The only fault I could mention is the backlight function. It's not nearly bright enough to accomplish the goal it was designed for which was one of the main reasons for selecting this odometer.
5,Cateye Bicycle Computer,"This is a great bicyle computer with top featers and backlighting. It is the main reason I purchased the unit...the button on back is pressed and the display is momentarily illuminated. Another great feature is a choice of mounting options shiped with the unit. It may be mounted on the handlebars in the traditional way, or, mounted on the handlebar stem. The latter keeps your handlebars free of clutter."
1,"Nice computer, the manual sucks","The computer works nicely, whoever designed the manual needs to be terminated from their job today. What the hell good is a cycle computer that is almost unprogrammable for the average person? There are several other brands available, buy on of those and skip an hour of rage."
4,I like it!!!,"The installation was easy, the instructions not so bad, the only things that I didn't like was the it came in a damaged box and that the monitor battery was dead, other than that its working just fine. Make sure that you check the dimentions because it is small."
4,Reliable & Accurate,"First, Amazon dumped over a YEAR's worth of reviews of Cateye's MC100W around 2010 which contained one of mine. Amazon, customers put time and effort into these reviews which helps your company to SELL products and stay in business. ;)On my electric bicycle, the distance from the transmitter to the receiver is ~ 27"" and the readings are accurate and STABLE. I recommend the MC100W at a price of $40. Sure, you can buy cheaper products, but the readings from these cheaper products are generally unreliable and unstable."
3,Nice Computer,"Good design and function; good value for money. Installation was a weak spot, needing zip ties to be done just right, with no spares. Transmitter was also bulkier than I expected. Directions for use were clear and intuitive, unlike my previous (Bontrager) speedometer. I still need to keep the paper instructions handy as actual button sequences are not all that intuitive to me. Overall, I'm happy and would recommend it.Update: have had problems with sender unit not functioning properly; will often fail to send any data, and occasionally post bad data--said my top speed was over 93 MPH. Even with new batteries still seems hit or miss. I'm lowering my rating."
4,drugs and excess,"the first time i read this book i was only a teenager and i don't remember reading it again for years. i don't even recall how this book came into my possession but i know i was grateful for it. i'd led a sheltered life and to read about someone's account of their painful existence was an eye-opener for me. this book may not be for everyone but it paved the way for my way of thinking today and i'm glad it landed in my hands.not being a big fan of jim morrison probably gave me a more objective view towards danny sugerman because i wasn't likely to think that this was all about sugerman's obsession with morrison or the band. i read it as a raw account of sugerman's life from when he was an adolescent into adulthood, and his realisation that there was more out there for him than just drugs and excess. most of his friends are dead today. the fact that he's alive is amazing given what he's put his body through.i have to read this book again soon."
5,Danny Sugarman took me on a wild ride right along with him!,"Danny proved with this book that he has an enormous writing talent that keeps me waiting for another. His writing style made me feel like I was right there beside him through everything.I laughed, partied and suffered right along with him. He had the wonderful opportunity to be where the rest of us could only dream about.Danny, congratulations on all of your success, and hopefully much more to come!"
5,Raw,"Nothing quite compares to the shock , horror and curiosity one finds in Sugerman's words. I have just read it the second time. Sugerman is not the stereo-typical L.A. brat, but at the same time he is. We all figured Hollywood was the mecca of drug-disaster we thought it was, but this is proof. Now, I look at everyone I see in movies and the ""business"" in a new light. Everyone is doing drugs of some sort. Media tends to tell us the horror side of drugs. If you do drugs you will immediately drop in the pit of hell. Sugerman didn't just survive the drugs, he worked well on drugs -- until the end. What did Sugerman do with all the years in between the end of Wonderland, and the release of the books? What is he doing today? What happened to the people he knew? You know it is a good book when it leaves you drooling for more. Kind of like heroin, eh?"
4,Before dirt was a clever marketing angle.,"Lately it seems just about every musician has a biography out. (I think it's part of their merchandising campaign.) They all have two things in common: glamour and excess--usually more excess than glamour, but the template appears to be the same: Jim Morrison's best selling bio, No One Here Gets out Alive, which Danny co-wrote. He had somewhat of an insider's view when it came to Jim's story (at least for a brief period), and in Wonderland Avenue he shares that same insider's view as he plows through the '70s and reveals the gritty, decadent underbelly of the music scene. A lot of great stories here; not just about the Doors but also about Iggy Pop, not to mention, his own story which is way more interesting than the latest printed version of Behind the Music that musicians seem to be unloading on us these days"
4,Rock-nRoll Hollywood Style,"Danny Sugarman is indeed candid in this autobiography! Sugarman was 13 when Jim Morrison was 22 and as they say:""The Rest Is History!"" Half way through the book Morrison allegedly dies and Sugarman goes on to meet Iggy Pop! The only question renaining is who's worse? Iggy? Jim? or Danny? Read this book and you will understand the excess that successful rock-n-roll lifestyles have."
5,Excellent,"This is an incredibly well written book, full of practical, real world information. I have begun implementing the tactics taught and I am experiencing a dramatic improvement in my gun-handling skills."
3,More Tactical opinions,"While one can get too much information on tactics this book had several additional ideas to use for your protection. Take away what holes you need to fill and then practice, practice, practice."
2,Hamming it up,"I have just completed listening to this less than enjoyable reprise. I still do not understand how a band can think that we the consumers wish to hear very bad renditions of their songs played off beat and with little regard to the hits that they originally were. Seems to me that they think that intentionally being off beat is something that we want to hear. These are some of my favorite songs and I will never listen to this butchery again. I am sorry. I love this band, but I wish I had not bought this."
1,What a travesty in Concert editing,Absolutely the worst editing of concert footage I have ever seen. TOM PILONG and PHIL TUCKETT should have their heads checked....what the heck were you thinking?....you destroyed this concert!!! What kind of drugs were you on?....Let the band play!....and don't touch ANYTHING!!!! Foreinger deserved soooo much better. I can't remember buying a concert DVD where the sound is awesome and the video is horrendous. I can only hope TOM PILONG and PHIL TUCKETT will NEVER BE HIRED again for any video projects.
1,Could have been a home movie!!,"This DVD sounds like a bootleg recording made by someone in the audience. The video is better, but agravating with a bunch of fast camera changes (like a music video). Don't waste your money."
5,My favourite concert DVD,I first got this on VHS back in 1994 and was blown away. I was delighted when it made it onto DVD and although there are no extras it doesn't need them. The concert really rocks. I cannot understand other reviews comments about the sound - mine is excellent. So what if the camera work is a bit slo-mo? Listen to the music - the songs are of course superb. As for Mick being too featured well what can I say - never even noticed this and it's his band anyway.The DVD is good value. Try it and see.
2,"More Lou, less Mick","I love Foreigner but this DVD could have been much better. Mick Jones must have paid someone to keep zooming the camera back to him. He was all trying to be something he isn't. Fake. Those facial expressions and moves are not for old guys like you, Mick. On the other hand, LOU looked like he was having fun and being himself. What you see is what you get and there should have been much more of Lou instead of Mick."
1,What copy of this do the 4 & 5 star reviewers have?,"I could throw this DVD away amd forget I ever owned it. It is the worst sounding, unsightly DVD concert(?) I have ever experienced---period!"
1,over the top,"The DVD production is horrid! Too much slo-mo crap and black and white cuts. They don't even get the cameras on the soloists when they are playing. It's very distracting from what would otherwise be a great concert DVD to own. I wish I could just sit down and talk to the yo-yos who cut this stupid thing and give them one simple piece of advice:""Sometime less is more!!!!!!!!"""
2,poor editing,"I know it was a live concert in 1993, but there is no excuse for poor editing. There are too many slow-mo portions inter-mixed with the live performance and also WAY too much crappy effects added to the picture. The band sounds pretty good, though, but the photographyy and picture editing are nearly without merit at all. Those responsible for this cheesey produced effort need to have their eyes gouged out and their digits removed to save us from any more of their over-the-top production. production like this ruins bands performances and leaves and negative reminder of the whole show."
3,Actual quality a little disappointing,"I would have wanted to know how poor quality the assorted clips of the actual television series, ""The Waltons,"" were in this documentary DVD. The information was interesting in regard to the inspiration of the story, but it really is unfortunate that more care was not taken on the overall presentation, in respect to such a wonderful television series."
5,Excellent Waltons,The Waltons are back. This DVD is very informative for any Waltons fan. There are plenty of interviews with cast members with some flashbacks.
5,Interesting Watch,"This was all about the ""real"" Walton's family and the ""real"" Walton's Mountain. Lots of stuff I never knew before. I'm glad I bought it to learn what I did. It is very dated though."
3,Not what I thought it was going to be,"I thought this DVD was from a special on TV in the US which recently aired in 2012. I didnt realise it was an old special. However, I enjoyed it and next time I will check the information about what I am buying more closely."
2,Toooo outdated material.,"This dvd was okay, but I didn't realize that it had been shown on pbs in 1997. I thought maybe it was something recently done and would maybe include more about the actors who played the characters, plus any footage that was shown from the original series was not very clear and looked terrible. It is not a bad video, but would have been nice if some updated video would have been added."
3,Older special but new release,"Since this is a new release product, I assumed (wrongly) that it was a new special about a beloved series, ""The Waltons"". Actually, it is a special done several years ago by a Virginia PBS station, and deals more with Earl Hamner's background and family than it does with the actual show. Also, there are clips from a Waltons cast reunion in Schuyler, Virginia. Nevertheless, die-hard fans will probably want to add it to their collections."
2,it was ok as a what and where of earl hammner,no waltons are even in this. it is all about the waltons musiem and how the thing came about. I loved the series and still do but I had hoped for so much more from the vidio that was not cheep.so I will think again before I buy a vidio about something like that.
3,Feels like Quality !,"I dont plan on using this in water,so im not sure how it would hold up ,but it feels well made , sturdy hard plastic sheath,cheap rubber straps,,knife has nice finish ,sharp blade ,and good weight ,,,"
4,definitely not a dive knife,im not a diver and even i could tell you this isnt a dive knife so dont say its crap ITS NOT A DIVE KNIFE. Its obvious because its all metal and the holster has a push button so you who use it in water are morons
4,Works fine,hard to get razor sharp but it is a cheap steel. fast shipping. the sheath is absolutely useless. didn't last a day.
3,OK knife,Ok so the knife over all is pretty good its light wieght but (as your probably know) you CANNOT stick your fingers into the holes in the knife i tried and it hurt. the ankle straps are good but thier a little ichy so wear tube socks under it. the sheath is OK as long as u take care of it. its made of cheap plastic and will break reasonably easy. also make sure you press the realese button when you intend to put the knife back or you till scratch the knife and dont try to be a ninja and whip it out or the sheath will break. over all its pretty good for its price and be carful when returning it to its sheath on your leg you may stab yourself
2,dive knife who tested ?,Honestly after actually diving with it I can see why it came as cheap as it did you get what you pay for the sheath is a pos and if you need a translation dont ask your parents for that one ...The knife itself is decent on land .In the water and explain to me this a dive knife shouldnt rust after being out of the water for twenty minutes mind you after getting wiped down.
3,Decent knife for the price.,"This knife has a good blade and is pretty sharp and seems pretty well built. However, it is not at all a dive knife. The knife rusted after 5 dives. But even then there isn't much I can ask for the price. If you want my suggestion, don't use it for diving. It's good for use on land."
2,Could definitley be better,"This knife DESIGN has the right idea. All you do is push the button and it releases the knife. The problem arises when you actually do it. The plastic holding in the knife is too long and is exactly ninety degrees. Thats a problem because you can't release the blade with one hand. In order to get it right you'll have to do some precision filing in almost no space to move a file. Also, the straps are rubber. In theory this is good for a dive knife, except for when its cheap rubber. I've had this knife for less than a month and the rubber is seperating from where I only adjusted the straps. Also, if you dive in a shorty suit, then the rubber will grab ALL of the hair on your leg if you wear it on your calf. Which you will have to, because if you have big thighs (and if your a dude who dives you probably don't have small thighs) you can't strap it anywhere but you calf."
3,ok for the price,plastic sheath- there are tabs on the inside that hold the knife in the sheath. three in all one round in the middle and two flat on the outer. the two flat makes the knife very difficult to remove when attached to your leg. I took a dremel tool and shaved them down and its better. be prepared to modify this to your needs.
5,Good for sailing,"Well I was sailing on the Pacific and I had this strapped to my thigh when all of a sudden a diver emerges from the water and climbs on my boat. I say "" well hi there. Aren't you a little far out to dive without your boat? She chuckles and says"" I suppose. So eventually after a little chat I take her back to the shore. She thanks me and says ""if it's not too much too ask, could I have some cab fare?"" I smile, pull out my wallet. She says "" I'll need about tree fiddy. I look up to see that she wasn't a diver at all but a 500 ft tall sea monster. I say"" Hell naw Nessie I ain't givin you tree fiddy, get out of here"". At this point Nessie shouldve tromped off, but she instead gave out a bellowing roar. At this point I pulled this knife out of its sheath and threw it at nessies's throat. Direct hit. Nessie gave a final war cry and I walked away"
1,razor back steel divers knife,A dive knife will be in oceanic waters (salt) which is corrosive. my dive knife is cheap chinese steel which never holds up against previously stated conditions. definitely not worth the money paid in for this product.
2,could be better,the product is very cheaply made and the product is not the same as the picture. the rubber is thick and makes it hard to get the knife out when it on you ankle/ leg. The blade is stainless steal which i like but i guess for the price its what i get
3,Eh,"the knife is of excellent quality, for the price, as is the sheath, however, the straps for the sheath leave quite a lot of room for improvement. they would not last a real dive at any real depth and remain reliable. at any depth the straps are not reliable."
4,clean and a razor!,"The knife itself is very nice,sharp and shiny,but the sheaths button is too hard to open,but maybe that;s jus mine. hell,at eight bucks,you're stealing this knife!! just think of the sheath as extra packaging!"
2,DIVE KNIFE,"AS STATED BY PREVIOUS BUYERS, THE STRAPS WERE NOT STRONG ""AT ALL"" THEY BOTH BROKE WHILE ASSEMBLING THEM TO THE SHEATH, WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY NEXT ISSUE, THE CLIPS THAT HOLD THE KNIFE IN ARE TOO LARGE, I TOOK A HOT BUTTER KNIFE AND MELTED MINE DOWN. NOW THE RELEASE WORKS LIKE IT SHOULD NOW, NOW I JUST NEED JUST NEED NEW STRAPS."
4,Good but....,Good knife but it is a little hard to get out of the sheath wen its strapped to ur leg but really good knife razor sharp on both ends over all i would say get it.
3,"The knife is okay, the sheath is not.","The knife itself I find perfectly acceptable, nothing all too special about it but that is completely fine, it does not advertise otherwise. It is nice and simple. Other reviews say that it is inadequate when diving, which is a shame since that is what it was advertising, but I would not know since I have not dived with it. I would say keep it on land just in case though, if all share that complaint then it is most likely true. The sheath - which is what I was buying it for - could be quite a bit better, the plastic is cheap, the straps are annoying, the release mechanism has to be jostled about and the knife has to be jerked on to remove, it seems like they were not even made to be used together. It is quite cheap and that does save it a bit, but if you are looking for a real dive knife that you may need in a diving emergency, well, trust your life with something worth more than ten dollars."
2,Is it really about Tupperware?,"I had to read this book in grad school and lead my class in a discussion of the book-total flop because I hated the book and the rest of the class didn't. I hated Tupperware mostly because it wasn't about tupperware or it's effect on America--it was all about the soap opera between Earl Tupper and Brownie Wise. The title is totally misleading-where is the mention of tupperware's famous return policy? What about the effect that it had on food and food preparation? What about the copy-cats? Tupperware could have been so much more. If I wanted a soap opera, I would turn on the TV."
1,Absolute junk!,"This adaptor is supposed to work for several systems, including XBox, Gamecube, N64 and others (where is the Dreamcast inclusion)? Hooking this up to either a N64 or Playstation (original) makes it sound horrible. It sounds like static while the game is running. It is so bad that you can not coherently hear voices or music, it all sounds very scratchy. Without the clean sound, obviously, some games are completely unplayable. I am sure it likely works that way with other systems, too. Do not be fooled by the price. Please just buy a first party rf cord for each console of your choice."
1,Bad!,"Ok i got this item but when you put an n64 system on the adapter and you turn the system on, it takes like 5 seconds for the screen to come up. After that the sound quality is very poor. I dont know about other systems but on n64 it dosent seem to work very good."
1,Don't waste your money,"I was looking for a RF adapter for a Sega genisis, I saw this one and read up on it, I even checked the model # to make sure it was compatable. I recieved it about 10 days after paying for it (why so long to ship from Arizona to Washington state?)and in no way is it compatible with the Genisis. I imediatly sent an E-mail to them stating so, well it's been 3 days now and still nothing. YOU lost my business forever. BEWARE!!!"
4,Noah beach towel,this was a must have for the little boy in our family named Noah for when we have our family reuion at the beach together
3,For a PS1,"The Mad Catz Racing Wheel and Pedals are much better than the hand controls. Purchased this for my grand kids and theyreally geat alot of enjoyment with the wheel. A PS1 is really out of date and I understand that the grand kids now want a PS3.Looking for a Mad Catz for a PS3 or Xbox. The low rating is because the wheel is for a PS1, would have been a 5 Star for a PS3."
2,Not for N64,I bought this wheel thinking that I could use it on both my Nintendo 64 and my Playstation 2. Well it works great on PS2 but it doesn't even have a controller jack for N64. The box clearly say: Use for Playstaion. I was very disappointed.
4,Generally Good,"For the most part this album is really good, including ""Crucified with Christ,"" but one has to listen when it comes to ""Living it Up."""
5,Great CD,"I listen to this CD all the time! It is great and I sing along! The words to the songs are so inspirational, God really speaks through these men! I hope to see them when they come to San Antonio! A must hear!!!"
3,GREAT VOICES-----AVERAGE TUNES,"PCD are a talented trio that sing with sincerity, conviction, creating very tight harmonies. My ""concern"" with TRUST is that it's pretty much interchangeable with any of their other albums. Nothing really new, either thematically nor musically, is offered, and I find their post-recording asides more annoying than endearing.However, TRUST does have a few good moments: MERCY CAME RUNNING and CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST are strong spiritual statements; AIN'T IT JUST LIKE LOVE has a different feel than the other up-tempo tracks and THANK YOU FOR PRAYING would melt the coldest heart.I applaud contemporary Christian music's attempts to pull in a wide audience and PCD has been successful for years. TRUST is ultimately an enjoyable experience, but I wish they'd take a few more creative risks."
5,This is the one I have played over and over. . . .,"This album contains a wonderful collection of Christian music that will inspire, encourage and uplift you. The song, ""Mercy Came Running"" always makes me cry. It reminds me, every time I hear it, of the love of Christ for us. I would highly recommend this music for any Christian, but it has special appeal to young people."
2,NOT Anti-Reflective,"I was very disappointed in this product. Nowhere on the item's packaging does it say ""Anti-reflective,"" and it is NOT anti-reflective, although it is billed as such. I contacted the seller and stated that I believed an error had been made in shipping, and they promptly reshipped - the exact same item again. It is a good screen protector, but does not cut down on glare and reflection at all."
2,Crinkles easily,"This screen protector was difficult to get detached from the backing. In the process it crinkled at a corner, now won't lie flat."
3,Nice material - a bit thick,"My wife and I were looking for some nice sheets for our bedroom, and we purchased these sheets (1000-thread) for about for five months now. When we first tried the sheets they seemed rough and very thick (heavy and rough like canvas) and assuming that was because they were new, it would go away. However, it has not. I would recommend purchasing a softer fabric product instead of this one if your looking for a softer feel from your sheets."
2,"I""d Spend My Money Somewhere Else","I consider this dvd money poorly spent. Many of the ""loops"" are single notes which are cut off and truncated. There are too few actual phrases and these are also chopped in such a way that they sound unnatural. Sound quality is o.k. Actually band in a box real tracks sound better and produce better results, though they are hard to work with. Overall, this didn't do it for me. I've downloaded a bunch of free loops from the internet that sound better and are not chopped up in such a way, that they are easy to work with. I'd look elsewhere on this one."
5,An incredible man,"Mike is my brother-in-law and one of the most amazing men I know. The things he endured and where he is today are eons apart.

3,Among the most dystopian of futures...,"Vornarburg paints a bleak picture of the future where humanity is divided into those who have locked themselves in the City and those who crudely survive outside it. Humanity is dying on both sides of the City walls. An aging scientist in the City creates a young girl with very special powers to rejuvenate humanity. But is she the salvation of the city or of the barbarians outside...Vornarburg creates a very dark mood without the fancy glitz of high tech. (Think Neuromancer without the fancy cyberspace cowboys jacking in and out. The mood feels more like PKDick than WGibson.) This book is more an intense drama and almost devoid of any real action. Nevertheless, the concepts are very intriguing."
5,Great Camping review,Great tunes for camping and hanging out - the kids like it and we enjoyed the 'tame' tunes too
1,Damp Rid,"I don't see that this has done a darn thing in several months. Our humidity runs 50% all the time so there's moisture in here. The crystals seem to be disolving or slowly clumping together but I've never seen any water below.I would not buy this again.I must EDIT my review. I put all of these out in various areas of the house. They do melt away and leave water in the bottom. But for this house, with a high humidity, I think the time it took for the crystals to fully disolve and the bottom to fill with water seemed awfully long."
1,Nice while it lasted,"Pretty much performs as advertised, right up to the point when it stops functioning 6 months after you own it."
5,Blossoming Eve,"I was wearing the sexiest shoes this new year. I had to take another pair of shoes to dance, but these are the ultimate ""sex pot"" shoes. Details are exquisite in the stitching and flower."
5,Good quality Lego Set!,On of my friends got my two brothers Lego racers as a gift. They spent hours playing with these durable and well designed sets. They wind up and give boys a lot of great constructive amusement.I would highly recomend these sets as great gifts for the boys on your list.
4,Great gift,"I gave my son this model, he likes the box and still after several months he still has in his show case, so much for putting this together. Mark"
1,Not Student Friendly,"I am a fan of Frederick Douglass. How could one not have mad, crazy love, for this precocious pioneer? I have taught his slave narrative in my high school English classes. I was looking for an engaging and student-friendly video companion to his slave narrative that I could actually show before reading the text. Unfortunately, this is not the one. While I understand that the conditions of Mr. Douglass' life were neither fun nor friendly, as the dvd is meant to both educate and entertain. This dvd is just too slow, too uninteresting, and not student friendly. This of course does not demean in any way the physical and mental hardships Mr. Douglass suffered. Showing this dvd to my 11th grade high school students, I fear, for them, would feel like the equivalent of a different kind of torture than Douglas endured. The truth is, even I had a hard time being engaged in this particular dvd account of Mr. Douglass' remarkable life."
3,Review of Biography of Fredrick Douglass DVD,I liked this video. I always view each video at least twice.Sometimes the first viewing may not go well.The information matched the information that wasin his Autobiograpy My Bondage and My Freedom.On a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate it at 6.
5,the 12-year old just can't figure it out!,"This system selector works great! I have no idea what that little kid was complaining about, but since when have 12-year olds been mechanically proficient? It's just a shame that the unit got its rating pulled down because some brat can't work it."
5,It works!,"I hooked up Nintendo, Sega Dreamcast, and Sony Playstation all into this little lightweight box and they all worked great! You have to remember which game is hooked up to which button (no labels) and it feels cheap (very lightweight), but it works and that's all that matters!"
5,The Best,"I've had mine for over 2 years. I bought mine at Target thought. It's been a real back saver. No more disconnecting and reconnecting. Also, when I got myself a new VCR, DVD Player, and Stereo System I use this allot. Mine's setup to allow the dvd player to show up as button one and the vcr's sound to show up on the stereo as button two. I can even combine buttons if I was both sound from the stereo and the TV. This may sound confusing to you but I like it ;-). The kid just probably got a bad one."
5,cheap & excellent,"This one is cheap, uses no additional power (no AC needed), and does not give any a/v interference. Best one I've tried. Get it for $10 + shipping at www.madcatzstore.com."
1,Didn't Work,"When I got this I thought it would help because I have a 64 and PSX plus a VCR. But when I tried to hook this up it didn't work at all. On the rare occasiaon that the picture worked, the sound still didn't. This was just a waste of money because it didn't work. I don't reccomend it."
2,No Playlist,"I bought this player (Actually the SA178/07) for my wife. It is small, and the FM tuner is a real plus. But the only way to create a play list is to rename the mp3 files so the order you want them to play is how they list in alphanumerical order. This is a real drag. We'll probably take it back. We're using Windows Media Player 9, not 10."
4,Not Bad...,"The userbility of this player is good and simple. Two complaints: the size of earbud, it's a bit on the large size...at least for me. The software, I hate Musicmatch, it works fine but I'm not finding it to be very simple. Who knows, next week after I've worked with it more I may like it too. I've had this player for about a week now and I've had no problems as yet, even when I'm jogging. I would recomend this player to whoever wants a nice player and doesn't want to spend alot of money."
3,Not good for podcasts,"The device itself is nice looking, easy to use, connects to your computer without a cable, and has surprisingly good FM reception (compared to my last player anyway). There is one huge problem with it though; it does not remember where in a file you were when you shut it off. This is a big problem for listening to podcasts. If I shut the player off 30 minutes into a 1 hour show, I need to fast-forward the show to get back to where I left off when I turn it back on. This is a glaring oversight, even for 2-minute music files. Hopefully they'll fix this in a firmware update sometime soon.Given that I mainly listen to long podcasts, this last issue is a real problem for me. I'd probably give it 4 or 5 stars otherwise."
3,Good value for the price.,"This is my first MP3 player. It is easy to set up and use. It's also compact and light, and has a bright screen - perfect for exercise and other outdoor activities. Holds approx. 125 songs or many, many hours of lectures, conference calls, audio books, etc.I like everything about this player except the fact that it ""loses your place"" when you turn it off. That is, if you're part of the way through a one hour call that was recorded on a single track, you have to write down or remember where you were when you turned the player off - because it will start at the beginning of the same track when you turn it on again.Hopefully, as another reviewer said, Philips will release a firmware update that addresses this issue. If not for that one challenge, I'd have rated it a solid 5.Hope this helps."
1,Do not buy this MP3 player.,"I bought this mp3 player just after Christmas. It worked great at first but slowly the battery started to fail. Eventually, it would not hold a charge at all, I would let it charge all night and it would only run for about 15 seconds before powering down.I called Philips and was told it only had a 3 month warranty. A $100 plus mp3 player and it only lasts for a few months?"
1,"Miller Rogaska by Reed & Barton Crystal Tango 8-Inch Candlesticks, Pair","dissapppointing - Miller Rogaska by Reed & Barton Crystal Tango 8-Inch Candlesticks, Pair arrived poorly packed and broken/chipped for crystal candle sticks - for a wedding gift - and was not able to have amazon replace with the same product at the same price - was available for substantially more than I originally paid- not a good experience and I did return which I had to repack and make arrangements to return.Miller Rogaska by Reed & Barton Crystal Tango 8-Inch Candlesticks, Pair"
2,Too much garlic,"My family did not like the garlic butter rice as the directions state to cook it. My 5 year old daughter who loves rice and garlic would not eat this rice the first time I made it. The garlic flavoring is way too strong. I made it again, but cooked one cup instant rice to mix in with it. Everyone in the family then ate it. From now on, I will cook one cup of instant rice to mix into it to use up the rest of the packages I bought through Amazon. But, I will not buy this again. Knorr/Lipton has much better rice flavors than this."
1,This book lacks depth.,I am currently in a Social Work program and can not figure out why this textbook is being used. This book flings a cornicopia of statistics at the reader while giving little interpretation of the data presented. At Risk Yourh does not give adequate description of relevant developmental stages nor the recommened therapeutic interventions suggested for treatment. I recommend this book for high school students only. This is the level in which the book is written. I suggest that all professionals not waste their time with this text.
4,The Over-Expensive Book,"Honestly, this book provides great resources for relating to at-risk youth and assisting them. However, it's over-priced. On an average, people who would like to assist at-risk youth are NOT RICH! They are individuals who see a need and have a heart-felt desire to help individuals with these issues. Of course, all good resources must cost ""a cost"" because of the detailed research which this book does possess. It proves that working with youths is a self-sacrificial job. I would recommend this book. It deals with important issues that youths are facing. It shows the development of behaviors and how different factors can increase negative outcomes or at-risk behaviors. Although, it is not very comprehensive, although it is comprehensive. It just fails to go deeper into different areas of the at-risk behaviors. I guess the term comprehensive is relative."
3,LOOKS PRETTY GOOD,"I received the book, and thank you. I'm thinking the person that had this book last, wrote, highlighted, and made main points. I hope they received an excellent grade in their class, and if they are an instructor, I believe they are awesome at capturing their audiences.The book does have highlighting, and writing. I was frankly surprised with this. This also kind of makes me think that the person that did it, that our personality types are similar.I will use the markings and the highlighting to my advantage!All in all the book looks pretty good, However, I think the price tag could have been a bit lower? In the 30.00 Range versus 50.00 amount.Thank you"
5,great,this was the first time i every bought books online and I was very surprise how fast my order got processed and the time it took for it to get to me in the mail. i will recommend buying more products from this seller to everyone i know. Thank you.
2,Rip OFF,"I'm a BJ Penn fan, don't get me wrong--but the production on this movie and the little quirks that they do really annoyed the hell out of me! They had to distort the UFC images so bad because they probably didn't even try to get the UFC's approval to show the images on their videos. Amature! Real Amatures!"
2,Not much here worth the purchase price,"If you're a big fan of BJ and MMA like myself, there isn't much here that you haven't heard or seen before. As stated in other reviews, the production is very much on the cheap, and if you've seen the UFC Primetime Series which basically covers the same time period then it will look that much worse in comparison. The fact that the UFC didn't allow them to use fight footage is fairly maddening. This is a documentary to hype one of their biggest fighters, what's the real harm in letting them show what he does best? I did enjoy some of the earlier footage of his BJJ career, but overall I really can't recommend it."
3,Biblical? No. But worth a watch...,"Don't buy this DVD expecting a solid scriptural source. The content is stereotypically secular, and biased toward the pervasive attitude of academia. However, the documentary aspect is strong, with great editing and visuals (par for the course with anything labeled History Channel). I would recommend this as a resource for those who are searching for something to juxtapose a scholarly christian perspective, or to illustrate the ""worldly perception"" of God. Information covers the broader concept of monotheistic god. Judeo-christian information falls short of accurate, but overall the presentation holds up."
4,Most Enjoyable,"I love the works by Karen Armstrong, but this is subject matter that is a little more than difficult to present with any objectivity. It is food for thought and is probably part of a bigger picture."
1,A history of fictions greatest monster,I bought this at the store for$10. The box made me think this was about differant cultures and how they created the differant gods. Instead this is only about yahweh (fiction's greatest monster). It tells the stories of the patriarchs and moses as if there were any facts in any of those myths. No evidence for any of the claims.The only thing worse than the content is Karen Armstrong's british smile.
4,We are getting there....,"This last volume was very good, it remind me of the quality of the first season. This show is great but far from the first season, I don't like Shinn as a lead character, if the show shifts the attention to Kira and Athrun in the last volumes it could be pretty good!"
3,okay FPS old school,"If you get this game for 5 bucks or less it will be worth it, not the best game but its easily playable and the controls will be familiar to all its something i would play in between the next big title"
3,Works fine,"I had no problem installing (on XP) and using this adapter with my USR Wireless router. I didn't have any luck getting it to switch into MAXg mode, however, which should be 50% faster. Also I didn't get as good a range as I hoped for. All in all, though, it worked just fine."
3,Coffee pot by Danesco,"It looks much better on the advertized photo then real. The bottom is not flat, therefore you could not use it on the electric, flat top, stove or it takes much more time to get it to the boiling point. It should be mentioned in description of the product. The handle is not tight to the pot and make you wonder how relaible it is.The product is ""OK"" for the price you paid, but could be better and more info in the product description."
5,One of my favorites,I sometimes tire of reading Bible commentaries that seem to be more about OTHER Bible commentaries than they are about the actual BIBLE. This is not one of those books. It is a true commentary on the book of John alone and is extremely insightful; it took me in directions I would not have thought to go on my own. His exegesis on John 5:19-24 (unity vs. equality) and John 9 (sight vs. blindness) almost brought me to my feet.
2,Poorly Written,"While this book is insightful, it's very poorly written. The author writes indirectly and could be so much more pithy and succinct. The book was so agitating, my class at Trinity Lutheran College in Everett, WA decided to nix the book mid-semester. Most of us wish the author could just come out and say what he knows rather than fill space with anecdotes and random information. I would encourage readers who are looking for a book that discusses the gospel of John to find a different book. If you can't, then definitely read this book as it does provide some insight."
1,Emd/Capitol did Bonnie a disservice with this DVD release,"I waited a long time for this release in DVD and was very surprised that it was released without the DTS format that is available on the CD. The DVD audio is very poor. While viewing the DVD, closeups of the percussionist and hamonica player are shown BUT you can not hear their respective instruments. Knowing the quality of the CD/DTS, this is huge let down. Numerous contacts to Emd/Capitol Records's customer service department remain unanswered (why have such a department?) through their email and website. Bonnie is a great artist and this was a great concert. The DVD misses the mark badly. I'd give the CD/DTS version 5 stars."
3,Great concert on VHS but not DVD...,"I'm a huge fan of Bonnie Raitt. Have all her albums and video releases. I got this on dvd for Christmas. I was all excited till I popped it in the dvd player and started watching it. The editing on this video is horrible, and there is a lot of vocal dubbing on it. The video doesn't match the vocal half the time which is rather annoying. If you get either the dvd or vhs, I would say you should get the VHS much better quality, better to watch and no lousy dubbing on the vocals."
4,Should have been.....,"This re-issue of the 1995 classic VHS concerttape/CD should have been right up there withthe best sound quality you could possible get, but,for some reason it didn't quite rate the very best.It still is top quality entertainment and I give itfour stars ****, come on, it doesn't sound that bad."
5,A MUST-own in-home concert DVD.,"Admittedly, I'm a big fan of Bonnie, and if I had any complaints about this live concert, it would be that there's not enough footage of her playing, BUT...There is a GREAT selection of tunes (I bought the CD when it was first released), and throughout the entire concert, no matter how bluesy and heart-wrenching, Bonnie's face literally lights up at the audience reaction after each song. She truly feeds on it! Also watching the band - especially the percussionist - is a lot of fun while you're tapping your feet. A don't-miss is the beautiful fretless bass guitar that shows up a little more than half way through the concert."
5,You'll LOVE this ...,"I love this DVD. I bought it for a party I was giving and it was a smash success -- like actually being there! If you love Bonnie, then you have to get this."
4,Staple product still has its pitfalls,"I find these ribbons to be reliable and somewhat sturdy. However, the big problem I find with them is when your machine runs extremely hot (775 socket) these cables have a tendency to dry up and get very brittle (same if you leave out in a heat exposed area). Otherwise it is a good buy and worth the money (the shipping can be a bit extreme)."
1,Saw it when it came out in 1977...it was boring then...,"...and it's still boring now, I am sure, though I won't inflict it on myself again.Think about it: if a horny 16-year old boy found this tedious, the artwork sloppy and uninspiring, the plot, well, stupidly simple-minded, do you think YOU are going to enjoy it?Titties on an elf ain't enough.Skip this one."
1,Not Good,I never liked this movie! My husband LOVED this movie he even got it on DVD. I have to agree with most of the negative comments; the movie is lame.
1,Mildly amusing film that I will never buy new.,"(...)And then there's Wizards.The Character of Avatar is (in personality) uncomfortably close to Vaugn (sp?) Bodé's Cheech Wizard. The World background, character design, and large sections of the story closely resemble a longer work of Bodé's; Strontium 90. If Bodé's heirs and assigns ever recieved one thin dime from the movie, I never heard about it.This is one of my wife's favorite films, so we compromise. I'll put up with it in the house, but we buy it used. Until I am authoratatively told otherwsie I must assume that Bakshi doesn't deserve any remuneration."
5,For the Love of Wizards,I remember at the age of 12 my old man taking me to the drive in to see this movie. It was the sexiest cartoon I had ever seen to that point of my young life. I especially loved the ending. I really loved sharing it with my son who is now 16. It is a fantasy classic.
3,Good...but not great,"Great idea. Very crude in implementation, though there are times when that does add to the charm. Honestly, I wish I liked this toon more that I do. It is just too obvious at times, though it tries so hard to be clever. I always thought about Wizards as a kind of cult film; however I have never run into anybody who has ever actually seen it.It is shorter than I remember it from when I was a kid. It is dripping with the 1970's... check it out; you will see what I mean."
2,Wizards Memiors,"When I was a kid, there was this seedy neighborhood theater that allowed us kids to see rated R movies... double-features for a buck. Featured one week was ""The Lord Of Rings"" and ""Wizards"".. I loved this movie when I first saw it. I sat there... slack-jawed and shocked at all the sex, swearing, and drug scenes I saw in this cartoon...It was the coolest thing a 12year old kid like me ever saw...that was then... back when the movie had an ""R"" (or ""X"") rating... I recently saw the butchered ""PG"" version of this flick... what happened?.. I dunno what these other reviewers saw... Am I the only guy who remembers Avatar the wizard smoking from a bong? The rampant cursing when ..""they killed Fritz?"" I hope someday they release the ""Theatrical Version"" of this movie... cuz this cotton candy version cut up for the 80's is pathetic"
5,Good Movie to watch!,"I think of this movie as the one that opened the door to all the other science fiction fantasy movies, such as Lord of the Rings. I seen this movie a long time ago, and went looking to see if any possibility of it being on DVD, and yep - Amazon.com had it!! It's so cool how you can find almost anything. The animation in this movie is not the best, but consider the date it was made. I do recommend this movie, it has so many funny moments, and the characters in the movie are awesome. I would really love to see this movie made again, with todays technology and computer animation, it would really be a huge Box office hit!"
3,A good movie if your a huge fan of Ralph Bakshi,"Be warned though the animation style will seem very sub par and low budget compared to other cult animation movies like Heavy Metal, Bakshi uses stock footage from films and shades it and adds on things to make it have some sort of animated look, the regular animation looks no better than the saturday morning cartoon animation of the same period.If your a big stickler for good animation in a film like this you will be dissapointed, especially if you can't get around it's bad look and enjoy the story, sadly that is me, the animation just turned me off in this movie, so much that I couldn't focus on the story.If you a fan of the Bakshi style of animation you will enjoy this film, like I said if you one of those people that demand good animation plus a good story it will leave you somewhat sour."
2,wow.... i was...... i was an idiot,I saw this movie when i was in 3rd grade and just recently saw it on the sci-fi channel and was about to order it until i saw the review about the dude who remembers the unedited theatrical version and i am not so content. Hey whoever wrote that review about the unedited version if u ever come back here i want to know what it was like. drop me a line man and id like to know what it was like my e-mail is below.
5,Great Fantasy Movie,"Humour filled, and with a moral to the story, WIZARDS is a great fantasy film for adults and teens. Really worth your time if you are into fantasy, or if you smoke more then just cigarettes. Everyone else has already told you what it's about, so I'll go get carpel tunnel elsewhere...."
4,Classic film,This is one of the great classic animated films. This version has a bonus of the creater Ralph Bakshi discussing how it came to be. I saw this film in the late 70's and loved it. It has become a cult classic. To save on money the creator used film overdrawn for some of the scenes. The whole film is and experience not to be missed.
2,blah,"blah... that's all. never really liked it when I was young, re-watched it and feel the same now. just blah. It's okay, don't get me wrong; but far from groundbreaking."
5,Wow,I remember this from when I was a kid back in the 70's - that and yellow submarine were great memories
4,Classic experimental animation,"Bakshi's best! I remembered this film vividly from childhood, and while I didn't remember its many idiosyncrasies, the magic is no less there. Good value for a great pressing of this movie--even looks good projected on the big screen."
4,I love the Old School,Love the old school feeling of this movie. I seen this a long time ago. Didn't really understand it then. But Id so now. They should show this on Tv once a month. Not to degrade a certain country but to show the world how things was and still could be but from a different country.
5,Wizards,"If you're old enough to have gone through the 60's the hard way as I've been told I did, you will dig this little film.John"
4,"Great sci-fi, don't fear Bakishi.","I've never been a fan of Ralph Bakshi but here he presents an original idea so silly it works.Every once and a while a truly bizarre film is made, so bizarre it works. `Ghostbusters' `Donnie Darko' `Blue Velvet.' These films are proof that silly ideas can workout.Here we are in a fantasyland with dragons knights and yes wizards. A great war erupts when an evil wizard Blackwolf discovers National Socialism and with his armies of SS troops and Panzer tanks is set to be the next furer.This film would certainly not appeal to the masses. Only the most hardened sci-fi fan could appreciate it. But it's worth your time because it's true sci-fi, not the garbage Hollywood jams down our throats and tells us is sci-fi.Those sci-fi fans worried about Bakishi, have no fear, enjoy yourself."
4,Weird. Really Weird. But Awesome.,"This seems like a history project produced in a single night that features ridiculous subjects put together such as nazism and wizardry, and seems weird at first, but with Bakshi's animation, and odd voice work, it's strangely enjoyable."
5,Underappreciated Cult Classic of the '70s,"If your head is in the right place, this movie absolutely rocks."
4,"Yeah, yeah ...","All that about good and evil applies, but if you work with marketing people you must see this just so you can visualize the ""Larry"" character during meetings."
3,"Good story, Great animation, TERRIBLE WRITING!","This movie has some of the best and most interesting animation I've ever scene (this from a small-time Anime otaku), but no matter how much I love good ol' High Fantasy a la Tolkien, I can't excuse two things: 1.) The dialogue writing in this flick is the pits, full of heroic cliches, and the voice ""talent"" doesn't go far to redeem it (sorry, Mr. Hamill... I do like your voice, tho ;) ) and 2.) The sound track is '77 to an extreme. Wailing arena-rock guitars and porn-worthy funk bass lines have no place in high fantasy. Worth a watch @ 3.50/night, but not worth the price tag to own."
2,Stay away from fantasy Ralph.,"""Wizards"" had the pontential to be one of the greatest animated features all time,but it fails miserably due to poor character development and shotty execution.The story itslef sounds good,Avatar the wizard and his allies must destroy a film projector that fuels rage of demons commanded by Avatar's evil brother Blackwolf.The biggest gripe I have with Wizards is that you really don't care about any of the characters,the film never goes into depth about any of them. Avatar and his allies are simply just there and that's about it. The film itself is also just a huge mess, it goes back and forth between poorly animated battle sequences then to boring and barely coherent situations Avatar and the gang get into.They are small attempts at humor here and there which overall fail and just doesn't make any sense.I think Ralph Bakshi should stick to what he knows, cold hard street life like in ""Heavy Traffic"" because fantasy is definetly not his area of expertise."
1,Terrible,My dad rented this movie for me when I was 8 years old. I found it to be more of a porn flic than an actual movie. Its director is the director of X-rated Fritz the Cat. No wonder it was so bad.
1,Was he trying to make this as awful as possible?,"Simple-minded plot consisting of mismatched over-the-top cliches incoherently scotch-taped together; what seems to be a systematic effort to include enough sexist, racist, and religious stereotypes to offend everyone on Earth and most of their house pets; incredibly cheap, jerky, worse-than-the-worst-of-Saturday-morning animation; and enough graphic violence to give the children who are supposedly the target audience nightmares. This is worse than the Super-8 ""movie"" my friends and I made in 9th grade, and I didn't think it could get worse than that. Just to make it even worse, there is just enough actually striking rotoscope imagery to give the viewer a hint of the potential that was blown in this project. If I were Ralph Bakshi or anyone else associated with this, I would change my name and pretend I'd never heard of it."
4,"Juvenile, but fun.","I loved this film when I was 13, and at 18, still thoroughly enjoyed it. I don't really like the animation-over-live-action stule the Bakshi uses, but the story is cute (but not deep). I recommend this film though I warn any viewers that you have to be in the right mindset to watch it. I intend to buy it if and when it comes out on DVD."
2,It's been a looooong time...,"I saw this in the theater (midnight showing) when it first came out in the late 70's. I was about sixteen, and apparently I was a lot higher than I remember, because I loved this movie back then. I couldn't wait to get my hands on the DVD, but it seems that thirty-odd years have changed my opinion drastically. I now find this film amateurish at best; awkward dialogue, a far-from-satisfying mess of a plot, and some truly awful animation render this flick a real disappointment."
5,"Different, yet Brilliant!","In short, Wizards ain't your typical watered-down Disney classic animated film. Wizards is not for the faint-of-heard. The protagonist himself is a bit of an anti-hero; a cigar smoking, dishevled old wizard with the sex drive of your typical wildebeest. Coming from the 1970s, the film is a sample of the best of the decade's independent animation. Incredibly unique (less formulated than even today's animated films), the film is horrifying, hilarious, and thought-provoking, often at the same time. If the tried-and-true formula for a ""successful"" movie is all you're open for, then this film will probably not appeal to you because Wizards breaks all the pre-set rules. However, if you're big on individuality, I highly recommend you give this gem a chance."
2,this movie is one of the worst movies!,"the only character i can give any stars to is Sean, king of the mountain fairies- and that's only because of the man who does the voice-Mark Hamill! i am sorry to say that this is the worst movie that mark was any part of and i am sorry to say that i was dumb enough to pay the amount that did to rent it."
2,Um...really weird,"I don't understand the cult following this film has. The plot is lame, the characters are weird, and the art is terrible. I'll admit it has it's moments but they're few and far between"
2,Make a South American rich,"I'm not sure how high you would have to be to think that this was a good movie, but I'm pretty sure that, in order to buy enough drugs, you'd have to make a significant contribution to the personal fortunes of some Columbian paramilitary kingpin. It's not worth it, man."
2,Dissappointing,"I wasn't expecting Disney, but I was less than thrilled by this feature. I'm assuming there's a genera of animation produced in the mid 70's that took the whole 'stoner' heavy metal thing and ran with it. Many many long drawn out scenes with rock music and psychedelic colors that did nothing for the story.I am an animation junkie and will watch anything and everything, but I couldn't get through this whole film."
5,A Bakshi gem,"Ralph Bakshi was one of the most innovative minds who saw the potential of animation for adults. His work is always an eclectic blend of fantasy and reality, the bawdy with the profound. In this world of escalating violence and terrorism, Wizards can have many new meanings with a very old message about Peace."
3,Wizards,"This is an excelent video - I saw it years ago and purchaced it for my son. It came as discribed new, original and still shrink-wrapped"
5,A Lost Masterpiece!,"I remember seeing this film as young kid though I really wasn't supposed too. I saw it with the film LIGHT YEARS another film that I hope will come to dvd in the very near future. This film is basically about a centuries old battle between two brothers. One on the side of magic, the other on the side of Technology. It's basic good versus evil with a bit of social commentary in between. The animation may not be what people are used to now, but it serves it's purpose. I personally like the rendition of the elves. They look more like elves from say ELF QUEST and not the overly tall elves of D&D fame. Pretty good film. Check it out for nostalgia if anything else."
3,Cute But Corny,"I first saw Wizards in the theater the year it came out,1977. Mark and Jeff C, Berford G, and myself, mouths stuffed with popcorn in the balcony of the old East theater on Broad St, in Columbus, OH. At the time we thought it was great. Half dressed, big breasted fairies, guns, tanks the stuff of kids dreams. We weren't driving yet, somebody's mom dropped us off. A few months ago I saw a special on cable about Frank Frazetta, the illustrator famous for his fantasy drawings, Ralph Bakshi was interviewd as well. It got me thinking about Wizards so I bought a copy. Does the movie hold up today? No. It's priminative compared to modern animation. Even the story is hokey. But for me it will always remind me of my friends and the movies. For no other reason but that it's great!"
4,Elfquest vs Vietnam,"Obviously the remnants of the anti-Vietnam sentiment, but still an interesting story to watch. The artisty is remisicent of Elfquest, but the storyline is a little slow. The still art while the narrator advances the story is annoying. I've been told that Bakshi, (already successful making the Fritz the Cat cartoons), wanted to make an animated Lord of the Rings. His backers said that they needed to see that an animated work about elves aimed at adults would succeed, so he made Wizards."
4,Price,"I have been looking for this album for quite a long time now. The only place I have been able to locate it is at Amazon.com. What I cannot understand is the price listed on Amazon.com ($93.99 in which the original price was listed at $15.99). While I really do want this item and willing to pay a little more than $15.99, the $93.99 price is ridiculous."
1,"Tragic Attempt to Humor = Loud, strident screaming for an hour","If you enjoy loud, strident screaming for nearly an hour, you'll enjoy this CD. She doesn't tell one single solitary joke for nearly an hour in which she does not resort to screaming, more a kin to SCREECHING, to gain laughter.The worst part? The morons in the audience to whom she panders... are laughing (probably canned?). There is no modulation between jokes, varying one that requires a little screeching with a few that don't... No. It is screeching and forced laughter from the very beginning to the end. She is undoubtedly the worst comic I have ever encounted.Oh, the jokes themselves... a few, very few were amusing, mildly amusing. Most were lame flops. My brand-new CD went into the trash without even getting to the very end. After 45 minutes, I was the one who was ready to scream."
4,Answers,"I just wanted to clear up the reviewer who gave this 3 stars because it didn't have full-length versions and was it was mixed. It was done in the form of radio show, thus the blended music/interviews. Also, it was difficult to put the full-length versions of the song due to the limited space on the CD. Some of these ol' school joints were 7 minutes long! However, the vinyl lover was not left behind as the full-length versions, minus the interviews were available on record. Thank you for the positive review."
3,The tracks are Mixed together.,First off let me say that this CD has many great Classic hip hop tracks. If your into oldschool this is great. The only reason I gave this 3 stars is that the cd is mixed and does not contain the full length tracks. Other then that its great to listen to and takes you back!
4,Huh?,"Somebody please help me out here. Why is John Schlitt on the album cover (in a band photo that looks like the ""Back to the Street"" days) when all of the songs on this album are from a time before John Schlitt replaced Greg X Volz as lead vocalist? John Schlitt is not a part of any of these songs. Somebody really goofed up somewhere.Regarding the lineup, I have all of the early Petra albums and this seems like a solid compilation, except that it does not include ""Angel of Light"". Mary's Song is a great song for the Christmas season (and originally written by comedian Mark Lowry)."
1,Why should the Father bother to listen to this piece of crap,"Once again Petra show why they are the cash cows of christian music, with a sad offering of their old standards. What I want to know is when they're going to dig out the aging chestnut ""Onward Christian SOldiers"" and try to pass that off to their adoring fan base in time for Christmas. Save your $$$ and buy one of the collections."
5,Morituri DVD,"I absolutely love this movie! Even though it's a little naive and not as spectacular as some of the modern military films. Morituri is a well-done WW2 movie with excellent actors, one of them is my favorite - Yul Brynner. Marlon Brando is also great!"
5,really interesting obscure film,"This is a war film about a british recruited saboture being placed aboard a german cargo ship hauling a load of rubber from Japan to German occupied France. The cast is far better than the material they are given to work with, but the result is a very good drama anyway. The only thing I disliked was the pointlessly bleak ending and the fact that nobody really captured the absurdity of the whole thing. The ship is on a sucide mission and Brando has been given a suicide mission within that suicide mission by the British. They try to give events some sort of a moral context, but it doesn't fully work. But the casting and the quality of the actors involved is A+. Brando did lots of bad movies in the 1960s but this, for all its obscurity, is not one of them."
3,Not a bad WWII movie,"I just happened across this movie off the Satellite. So I decided to buy it because I found it a pretty fair WWII movie. Marlon was using his ""Young Lions"" German accent. Yul Brenner was the ships captain. Subversion of the Third Reich working aboard ship. Failed mutiny but lots of acting and developemnt of characters. Not just blowing up ships. Not a great movie but holds your interest and entertaining if you like Brando and Brenner (I do!)"
3,Worth Seeing Once,"I am a Marlon Brando fan. To be honest I see no reason to see this movie if you are not. For a 60's Brando film this is probably one of the best. He seems to care. His German accent wears thin by the end of the film, but the plot is relativly engaging. Check it out."
4,"very informative book, but needs new title!","This book is written from a Christian stewardship/health perspective, with lots of good nutritional information and practical ideas for adapting your current diet to make it more healthy. I've learned a lot from this book including: using sugar substitutes such as honey and granulated fructose, the healthiest oils to use in cooking and baking, using ground turkey instead of ground beef, and many more tips. Our family's eating habits are gradually becoming more healthful thanks to this book. It's more health information guide than cookbook, but does contain a few recipes that show how to put the information to work in your everyday cooking. My only complaints are that the title does not reflect the contents of the book, and there are too few recipes included. But the detailed health information makes this book worthwhile reading."
1,Realistic????? For whom?????,"I have read many of Emilie Barnes' other books on organization and have found them practical and down to earth. So when I saw she had a book out about meal planning, I purchased it eagerly. What a disappointment! As another reviewer noted, it is mostly ""preaching"" about Ms. Barnes' and Ms. Gregg's interpretation of scripture regarding food and nutrition. They admit in the book they are not ""nutritionists"" and are only trying to help women with meal planning, yet they certainly have a lot of ""do's and don'ts"" regarding the area of nutrition! Incidentally, I AM a Christian and found some of the conclusions drawn in the book interesting, if not very well backed up. I did try a few of the recipes and none were good; in fact, only one was edible. (And I am not THAT bad of a cook!) I wholeheartedly recommend Ms. Barnes' other books on home organization but I just cannot recommend this one."
5,Whoa!!! Shouted the Universe after the Big Bang was Over,"The intuitive shamans of mellifluous chaos and incorporeal turbulent travelogues open the gates and the Cosmos becomes a wonderful mess. Like doing peyote under an electric storm while a saguaro cactus performs acupuncture on the battered remains of your medulla oblongata, after the merciless, ultra-distorted geetar excursions of the Gibbon brothers move on over your unsuspecting perceptive system like a friendly hurricane across the Bermuda Triangle. Meanwhile, a pack of wild chihuahuas stomps all over your ego at the arrhythmic and ponderous pace set somnambulisticly by Joe Culver, as Isobel Sollenberger mumbles cryptic incantations in what English would sound like if frozen at absolute zero and placed under the Iguazú cataracts for safekeeping. And it's all washed in a golden halo of fuzz. An electrocuted nirvana."
4,New philosophy for a changing marketplace,"I was very impressed with this book, and its insight into the changing marketplace. I've found that so many industries, particularly those related to the high-tech field, are becoming commoditized much more quickly than previous industries had. In other words, newer industries/technologies are maturing at a faster rate than ever before. As a result, companies interested in maintaining healthy margins/revenues, need to consider how to stimulate demand for their products. ""Demand driven supply chains"" provides an interesting and optimistic view of the changes that need to be, and can be, made for companies to remain healthy in a maturing market."
1,An Unintelligible Mess,"""The endless digressions and self-interruptions of this study, as it meanders from Kant to Krishna, Schiller to Sati, belong, among other places, to a politically directionless Left. [This book is a] garrulous hotch-potch [filled with] . . . overstuffed, excessively elliptical prose. . . . The ellipses, the heavy-handed jargon, the cavalier assumption that you know what she means, or that if you don't she doesn't much care, are as much the overcodings of an academic coterie as a smack in the face for conventional scholarship.""--Terry Eagleton, in THE LONDON REVIEW OF BOOKS"
2,The irony,"I must admit, I did not read the entire book. But it is not because I didn't try.Spivak is a close associate of Judith Butler, and this text demonstrates the connect -- no person lacking a very specific culural and feminist education can read it.This is the irony of such texts. Spivak cleary seeks to empower women and individuals of color oppressed by Western hegemony -- ttself a jargon phrase-- yet no one she seeks to liberate could remotely understand her text. Nor could many scholars like myself, who seek to learn from her infinite wisdom.At some point, I would hope that scholars like Spivak would take a page from the Lawrence Grossbergs of the world and begin to write in more accessible languageTo do so is not anti-intelectual -- it is indeed an attempt to ADVANCE scholarship."
3,17 out of 18 is pretty good I guess...,"I ordered 3 packs of these bags to store some silver items to help prevent them from tarnishing. They shipped as expected, in a very timely manner, and the items were just as described as far as size and quality. I was quite pleased until I was almost to the end of the task of bagging up my items and wondered why I still had an item remaining and no bags... One of the packages only had 5 pouches rather than the 6 that should have been contained in the pack. Oh well."
3,4.5 inch by 3.5 inch,What you expect for a few dollars. Material isn't fancy. Biggest complaint is the false advertisement; its actally 4.5 inch by 3.5 inch. I would of ordered a differnt set if I knew about this.
2,Wrong Items Sent,"I ordered the 5"" bags and received 3"" bags. I had to return the items due to the size. I am disappointed that they were not able to send the correct bags."
3,Various artists...?,"Yes, but not the various original artists.Sounds close to originals but be aware..."
1,Couldn't get into this book,"I had alot of hope for this book , but I just couldn't get past the first few chapters. The dialogue between the 2 men seemed so stupid. I tried to hang in there for the part when the women arrive, but I just couldn't stand it anymore."
5,Wonderful marinade!,"I have only found this flavor of marinade here on Amazon, and we love it! It has a wonderful garlic flavor with just the right amount of lime (so it is not overwhelming). We have used it on chicken and pork chops, and it is now one of our favorite marinades."
3,Okey?,"Have been unable to find all the great aspects of this product. It is acceptable and in my case only rates a 3.5 Stars at best. Used it on fish, chicken with no outstanding results. Average and that is, okey? Will not buy it again for I believe there are better options but for now they will be used, one way or the other. By they I mean 6 bottles (we are down to 4). Happy eating!"
3,Still waiting for a good Python book...,"I have two complaints about this book:* The publisher didn't bother to have a native speaker of English correct the author's quirky language. (On multiple occasions, for example, the author talks about ""informing"" an item into a list when he clearly means ""inserting."") After awhile, this kind of thing begins to grate on the reader.* Like all the other Python books on the market, this one is just another cut-and-paste job from the python.org website. I want something that tells me *more* than what's on the website. I want a book that clarifies and goes beyond the website. I want to find out about ""gotchas"", and workarounds, and things I wouldn't know just from reading the website. In that regard, this book really doesn't deliver. Too bad..."
4,Some good movies,Catherine Cookson has some really good books. I have to say I like the movies better than the books as they are a little hard to get through at times...at least for me.I really liked The Glass Virgin and The Dwelling Place.The Glass Virgin is about a young girl that grows up believing she is the daughter of her parents. When the truth comes out her life changes dramatically. She goes through much hardship with a special friend.The Dwelling Place is again about hardship and making choices. The young girl is raped. Other reviewers have stated the unlikelyhood of her marrying the rapist. I have to disagree to some degree because it was a different time and place then. There are historical accounts of women doing just that and living their lives out together.
3,Cathy's pick,I like period pieces like sense and sensibility etc. thought I would like this collection based on description.....not my cup of tea. Will stick to the classics.
1,Come on now.,"This is the first Sarah Graves book I've read, and the last. It is full of adverbs which should have been my first clue of a poor writer. Secondly, the ""plot"" jumps back and forth between try to solve a mystery and applying Spackle to a wall. The plot was week, the delivery was worse yet and I kept thinking something is going to develop here, but never does.Maybe she should take up home repairs."
3,o.k. A little hard to get into,"This book ended lovely, but getting into it took some work. I think that part of it may be that the names were hard to work out the way they sounded in your head. I thought the book would have been much better if the characters names that been easier to read. The story seemed to be going no where fast and then it picked up somewhere around page 75. This book would not be one of the first books that I recommend, but it would be in the middle."
4,Other Worlds - Read often shelf,"This is a great book. Other worlds is for anybody that just loves to look at images of space. Easy reading, informative and thought provocing. It will be on my read often shelf!."
1,Amateur Acheologist Sells Book,"From an archeologist's point of view, this is a momentous example of pseudo Pscience. Someone has picked over a lot of indian sites in Oregon and pieced together theory and fact in the tradition of the backyard rockhound that will make any archeologist squirm. Nice pictures, but like artifacts brought home from a cave in a gunny sack, not worthy science. Sorry ... finding out this was bogus. Hard to review content when there isn't any. Yes, I have credentials, studied with Roger Greene, Bion Griffin, Raymond Firth, Wm.Solheim, Tom Kirch, Ben Finney, etc."
4,Great,"Great product! Easy to use, easy instructions. I used this on my surf board and it was easy, simple and I was back on the water in no time."
5,I Gave This to A Protestant,"I gave this to my devout Protestant friend and she LOVES it. She didn't have tools in her own religion to pray like this and regularly. We can sit down to pray but often don't have the words or more than one intention at the moment.The Little Office gives us 20 minutes of rich prayer, a couple times a day, that reminds us of the wonderfulness of heaven."
5,Excellent Devotion,The Little Office is a wondersful devotion to the Blessed Mother and a great way to pray in union with the Church. I highly recommend this breviary.
5,"Little Office of the Blessed Virgin, Mary",Well done book. Great cover and binding. Clear instructions. Some options of prayers and antiphons. Good printing. Ribbon included.
2,LIttle Office of BVM,"This edition of the Little Office of the BVM is a post-Vatican II version. I hate to admit it, but I don't know how to say the Little Office to benefit from the Brown Scapular. Sure, there are morning and evening prayers for the days of the week, but the other ""hours"" seem to reside in a rather long Office of Readings. So I donated my two copies to my parish church and ordered a traditional version from another source."
1,Get the Pre-Vatican II version,"Get the pre-Vatican II version of the Little Office instead. Why? First of all, the proper number of hours for an office is eight: Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline. This number fulfills what is written in the book of Psalms, ""At midnight I rise to thank thee"" (corresponding to Matins), and ""Seven times a day I praise Thee"" (corresponding to Lauds through Compline). This is how all Offices, for any religious order, were constructed since the Church was founded. As Yogi would say, ""you can look it up!"". In addition, the language in the older versions is much richer and more reverent as compared to the trite and banal drivel found in the Modernist translations. All Vatican II reforms are trash, brought to you by the Modernist cabal trying to destroy the Church."
3,Pleasant biographic overview,"I got this dvd to supplement the PBS box set The Presidents which didn't have a dvd on Eisenhower.This dvd is from the A&E; Biography series and so tends to take an overall view of Eisenhower's life, hitting the maybe more familiar highs and lows with members of his family and co-workers offering their views, etc. It fell short for me on Eisenhower's Presidency. It captured it in essence but if this dvd had been lengthened out to 2 dvds, looking into his cabinet, his style as a President, etc. it might have been a great set. It seemed before you knew it, the 100 minutes was gone and you didn't get a more in-depth sense of the significance of his presidency. I'm sure someone will put another dvd out."
5,The missing bio,"This is the biography that should have been in with the set, ""The Presidents"" from the PBS Home Video Collection to complete that set. Ike was a cool peacekeeper managing hot headed generals. It's no surprise the country liked Ike, and both political parties courted him to run for president in their party. This is a short piece which could have been expanded to include so much more, but it is good all the same."
3,somewhat disappointing,"I'm sure it is difficult (impossible?) to condense a life filled with extraordinary accomplishments into a 100 minute film. But, given that problem, to my taste entirely too much time and space was devoted in this presentation to ""talking heads"" giving their opinions and perspectives on Eisenhower---most of whom had never met the man. I'm sure there are miles of newsreel film and hundreds of photographs of Eisenhower available, especially during WWII and his presidency, which would have made this biography a far more interesting and complete portrayal of the extraordinary man that he was. Om spite of this shortcoming, however, it does have some favorable points which make it worthwhile viewing."
5,Gorgeous!,"This valance, while pretty in the picture, is even prettier than it appears. The colour is a rich ruby red with a deep satiny stripe, and the other colours are really vibrant. Great fabric....perfect purchase."
3,"Cheaply Done, But Worth It For Fans","Not the greatest movies from Marx Brothers, but it's a double feature with nothing much more. I'd only recommend it for the avid fan."
4,See jewelry clearly,My granddaughter and I can see all my jewelry at a glance. It forced me to organize the jumble. I also bought one for my sister.
5,CLR + C# = MSIL On Steroids.,"If you want to know what is going on under the hood, thn this is THE book.Every chapter is very in depth with good examples. Definite YES for the geek inside you. 5 Stars."
3,Introductory to itermediate material,"The book is oriented toward experienced programmers. It provides an introduction to the CLR and describes some intermediate topics in detail. Advanced topics are mentioned, but the coverage of advanced topics (such as CLR hosting) is shallow.If you are an experienced programmer who is new to the CLR and C#, this is a great text. If you already understand the CLR and are looking for more information about advanced techniques, this book is probably not for you."
5,A great book,This book is really fascinating. It's the only book I've seen dealing with the the inner workings of the CLR. It really helps understand what's going on when writing C# code. Highly recommended! A lot of substance!
4,A must-read before understanding managed code,"The book is very clearly written, and I typically have issues with code samples showing nuances of languages and environments, but they are quite clear here.This was recommended reading that I did before beginning a dev job out of school since I had worked almost exclusively in a *nix environment, but would have to at least be able to read (and eventually write a bit of) managed code for the Windows CLR. It is a thorough introduction to the necessities of CLR coding and gives very useful analogies/similarities with other languages that I found quite useful (especially C++).Without this, I would have spent a LOT of time on my own writing various test programs and not fully understanding what was going on under the covers. There is also quite a bit of code samples showing the IL generated for the runtime that is quite useful.Other reviews cover the topics etc., and all I'll say about them is that they are all applicable and clearly written."
3,Covers stuff in depth,"Jeffery Richter has done an excellent job in covering CLR. There are lots of books in market which teach you how to program in C#, but avoid details of CLR. They book is pro developers who want to gain expert level knowledge of C# and CLR. This book along with Professional .NET Framework by Duffy covers whole nine yards."
5,A must have for .net knowledge,"This book is for those who want to learn CLR. C# is used just as a means to illustrate features. CLR is language agnostic.Jeffrey Richter steers us wonderfully through CLR. Very neatly explained using various diagrams and pictures. No unnecessary prose.If you are curious about .Net, this is a must have book."
4,"Obsolete, but must to learn","The book describes .NET2.0 internals very well. I believe this is very good to learn some basic stuff, like GC, regardless of .NET version. Hope to see the same book for .NET4."
5,Essential reading for ALL .NET Developers,"Considering how many books about .NET there are today, it's surprising how many of these books are really rather good.However, there are a number of books that are truly GREAT. This is one of them.Quite simply - if you're a .NET developer, you owe it to yourself to buy this book, regardless of your level of skill with this or any other technology - there are few people with the skills, background and expeirence and sheer ability to write coherently that can exceed Jeff Richter in Windows development overall, and his ability to detail just HOW the CLR and .NET FX work is unsurpassed.Essential reading."
4,Good Flash,"Good Flash for the money. If you are planning to shoot big weddings or other huge events you may want to go with the 580, but this is great for everything else and it is much cheaper."
5,Love it...,"Take your Canon Rebel XTi camera or photography to a new level with the this flash. You can get nautral looking shots by bouncing or ? the flash.Once you use an external flash you'll never want to use the built-in flash again. It works well in auto mode but gives you full manual control if you want it. The flash is powerful and recylces quickly. Definitely, definitely worth it."
4,Great Flash for all needs,"This is a great flash that works for just about everything. The only downside is that it doesnot come with a diffuser, I would have gladly paid $10 extra for it. But alas ... it still works."
5,More Flash Than I will ever need.,I am a new to photography and I am glad I went for this flash. This flash has the power and extra features to grow with.
4,the night become bright,I used Canon 430EX Speedlite Flash in the very dark area. I can see everything around object which I shot and then the background absolutly captured.
5,Great flash ... nice interface with Canon XTi ... excellent sports pix,"I'll leave the detailed analytical reports to the serious photo junkies out there and just share that I recently used this new flash at a large indoor sports competition with my newly purchased Canon Rebel XTi and was very pleased with the results. From a distance of about forty feet the flash lit up the competition ring at a karate tournament very well, allowing us to get nice pictures in a venue not lit well enough for my Canon EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS lens. The camera and flash synchronize to ensure a perfect shot every time and recycle time is incredibly fast."
5,"Very good ""pro"" flash for beginners","Once you have it, you will never go back to the small flash came with the camera. The only cons I found is that the manual is even thicker than the manual for my Rebel XTi."
4,Love it so far,"Unfortunately, haven't had as much time to use it as I would have hoped, but from what I've seen so far, I love it. Easy to use. Great quality pictures. The light quality is good; doesn't give you that blast of harsh light like the on camera flash. I tend to like the more golden pics in low light and this seems to maintain some of those tones when bouncing off ceiling. It does make the camera a little xtra heavy though - really noticed it when I put on my zoom lens. That will take some getting used to...and a little muscle building :). Once I get to use it a little more, if there's anything to report, good or bad, I'll check back in."
4,good as a back up,"i was happy when i bought itit's fast and light, then i started shooting more and more and needed one more flash so i bought a 550ex older generation, slower but what a light, so this become m back up or second light source.if you can buy the 580ex II or 580ex and as a chepper way out 550ex for a better lighting source, this is a great item to carry arround or as a secnd flash.Bottom line:definitely better than your on camera flash, to big for you g9-g10(see 220ex) you will eventually sell it and buy the 580"
5,You won't regret buying this one!,"I have a Canon Rebel XSI which I love, and just received my 430X Speedlite Flash last week. This is really a great flash, its like getting the other half of your camera. It's very easy to use, and works great with the Canon XSI. You won't regret buying this one."
4,Great flash,Got this for my girlfriend and she loves it. She can take great pictures anywhere now. Great product
4,"Wow, nice flash!!!","I typically take pictures outside during the day so I haven't had a need for a ""real flash"". I've always used the flash built into my Rebel XTi when I needed to (for group pictures). I'm so glad I spent the money on this Flash after taking some test shots indoors. I love how I can bounce light off at different angles and the various modes with the lens. I need to invest in 4 AA rechargeables for it though so I don't go thru Aklaline batteries. Anyway I haven't used this Flash a lot yet (just test shots) but I know I'll love it! It will work great up to 40' and that's all I anticipate needing and all I could afford after buying some other add-ons (lens'). I highly recommend this flash but can not quite give it 5 stars since I've only begun playing with it."
4,Great Flash,Excellent addition for Rebel XT. Tried lower cost generic flash units. My only regret is that I waited so long to get the 430EX.
5,Having lost of fun with this one,"I purchased this along with my new Canon 30D DSLR. I mainly use it for fills in outside sunny days, but it has been used to light up the situation. I'm personally still learning about how to best angle the light to get the best outcome, but I don't think it'll take long."
5,Meets and exceeds needs exactly for an intermediate Rebel XT user,"Bought for $240 at bhphotovideo.comGreat first flash, can be slave after buying next level up (ie- 580).Biggest advantage for me: built-in focusing system (AF Assist Lamp), can pretty much focus in pitch black. Perfect for 350 users like me who only have a 7 point system which is horrible in low light.- All the necessary functions plus manual (great simple start for beginners)- Neat button layout- Not too big or too heavy (like 580).- Rotation is completely satisfactory.- Powerful enough to fill most average sized rooms and even small churches from own experience.- Decent refresh rate for most use.Worth the money for those who are taking their hobby to the next level but can't spend a fortune.My gear: Digital Rebel XT, 18-55mm f3.5-5.6, 50mm f1.8And this flash complements it very well."
5,"Great flash, excellent match","The Canon 430EX is a no-brainer flash. It works great, recyles fast, excellent tilt and twist flash head. Don't waste your money on the expensive model. I give the 430EX an A+, must have unit."
4,I like it but don't love it,The flash is okay but it slows the shutter speed greatly so I seldom use it. But it's great when speed is not important.
5,Great flash,Very happy with this flash. 430 fits my needs. No need to step up to the 580 which is much more expensive.
4,Good for what it is,"I've used both the 430EX and 580EX, but I own the 430EX. The 430 is a great flash, actually, but if you are a pro, shell out the extra clams for the 580; It has more options, stronger flash, and a faster recycle time. I lent my camera to someone to shoot a wedding and only every other picture of the processional came out because the flash didn't recycle fast enough (with new batteries), same thing for the reception. I hate missing great shots because the flash isn't ready. As long as you don't expect to take too many pictures in a row, it's a great piece of equipment... I plan to buy the 580 some day and use this one as a slave unit (a very cool, built-in feature)"
5,a good buy,I am pleased with the Canon 430EX speedlite flash attachment. I was also pleased with the good service and prompt delivery of the product.
4,Does the job,"In a hunt to find a bargain Canon flash, buying an older model 430 EX was my only option. The flash is great- smooth swivel and easy to use manual and TTL functions. Unfortunately you have to buy a even pricier 580 EX to master the slave networking function on this flash.The price is about as good as you can get for a recent model new Canon flash. These are incredibly hard to find on ebay, hence me shelling out the $185 USD."
5,Great addition to my Rebel XTi set-up,Fabulous flash. Love the swivel head and all the angles you can get for great lighting. A must have for any serious amateur photographer.
4,Solid Flash,"A lot cheaper than the 580ex. If you want a solid flash and you're not a professional, this is definitely a must own. I'm happy with its size and weight. Your flash photography will be greatly improved and you won't regret it."
4,Very Pleased,"I haven't used the flash very much yet, but the photos I have taken are dramatically better than indoor photos with the built in flash on the Canon Rebel. I wish I would have purchased the flash two years ago because many of my existing photos would be much better. If you need a flash for a Canon Digital SLR, try this one!"
2,Way too stiff to use,"The box says that the epoxy has a one hour working time. I found it almost impossible to work within 10 minutes of mixing. I tried to repair some damaged wood in a porch railing. The epoxy stuck to both plastic and metal putty knives better than it stuck to the wood. The mixture was so stiff that that I couldn't force it into 1/8"" wide cracks.There are no cleanup instructions but I found that rubbing alcohol on a rag cleaned the epoxy off the putty knife and my fingers."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED!,"This product is not even close as advertised. I followed the direction exactly and the end result was nothing like wood. It will not hold a screw and using a chisel is a chore twice fold. The problem, its been 24 hours and it hasn't hardened completely; bought another box at a different store to see if there may have been a product malfunction. NOPE! Still the same result.How I fixed it...Bought some multi-purpose filler and separate hardner.Removed the ""damaged wood product"" and replaced it with the multi-purpose filler. Hardened in 10 min to a drillable furface, didn't shrink, and worked with a chisel. Better yet...it cost HALF the price."
3,okay results,Used this product to repair a salvaged vintage door that had damaged wood. The two products seemed dry as they were combined and was difficult to smooth out. It did dry hard and sanded well.
4,Kana can be easy - worth it,this is a very good product to assist in learning the first two writing systems of Japanese. they have creative and fun pictures to help make a connection between the sound and the character and easily remember both hirigana and katakana symbols.
5,Great book,I was all it was supposed to be. I order it and it came in in time and just as it was on the list.
4,You'll like this if you like DC Talk.,"These guys combine hip hop and metal to bring the message of God to a younger generation. Funny thing about that is I am over 30 (closer to 40) and I like this CD alot. My favorite song is ""Masquerade"" but all of the songs have their moments. An impressive album by these guys."
5,It Rocks,"The music on this cd is awesome...I would really recomend getting this cd, especially if you're looking for some great music with lerics that really glorify GOD...I couldn't live without it!"
5,Innovative and unique,"Reality Check blends so many styles without leaning too heavily on one particular sound. Funk, Hip Hop, Rock, Grunge, Rap... I love this band so much! Their split just grinds at me because I listen to this CD far more than is healthy. There's no annoying whiny rap here... it's just good stuff. There aren't any half baked and stereotypical melodies here... just well constructed tunes that sound DIFFERENT. I hope the solo album doesn't loose the RC roots! Buy it... it's sweet."
5,The Absolute Best!!!,"This is the best collection of songs I have ever heard, by one of the most talented groups of people I have ever had the of hanging out with. The lyrics are indirect, yet so up-to-date with teenagers today. It's not your normal ""God, God, God..."" lyrics. It's AWESOME! Nathan, Chris, Rod, Dave, Jody, Jimmy, and Dan are truly gifted! You'll find yourself listening over and over and over again."
4,Don't have time to watch or learn what Dragon Ball is?,"Then this is the movie for you! It has the basic idea of what the television series is, because the anime was based on this movie. So if you want a brief, main idea, summary... buy this movie. It's great, even though you don't get to involved with the character's personality. Even though the manga and series if so much better, but you wouldn't really know unless you've seen it."
2,A failed experiment,"I file this with my ""failed experiment"" music (Lucier's 'Amplified Brain Waves and Percussion' et al)..stuff that is interesting in inspiration or execution , but leaves me with no real interest in hearing again. Like the Lucier work or a lot of other esoteric music, I'm glad it was composed, recorded and that I had a chance to hear it, sadly, it simply doesn't make for enjoyable listening. There is a lot of other, very enjoyable works by Mr Belew and I urge you to seek them out, This is for hard-core completests and collecters of MIDI demo-discs only. Sorry Adrian."
5,Excellent service,Excellent and rapid service. The description of the book was accurate. I would be delighted to use this seller again.
4,Wire Beads,The book is owesome.I really like it. Easy to follow instrution and uderstanding paragraph on how to do the wire beads .Glad they brought it back out.
1,BETTER BOOKS OUT THERE!,"All in Black and White, no pictures on showing how to do anything. Just pictures showing what it looks like done. Poor pictures. DO not buy it. GO to the library first. Save your money--I REALLY wished I had."
4,this is a good book you should get it,"i bought this book of a bum on the street in berkeley, ca. its awsome. its got great history and knowledge about the traditions of hash making and hash smoking around the world. its pretty neat. nice middle section of color pictures too ! very cool. the methods for making hash could be a little bit better explained and maybe some better pictures. but overall, its a winner."
3,Misunderstandings galore,"Most of the reviewers seem to confuse rewards with reinforcers. An extrinsic reward is not guaranteed to be a reinforcer. Skinner made it very clear in SCIENCE AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR that the determination of reinforcers in human beings was often complex. I rate this book 3 stars because the author did not make it clear enough that his work was about ""amateur"" behaviorism and not necessarily a condemnation of scientific behavioral analyses and interventions. Most teachers are probably not qualified to analyze operants and reinforcers with enough skill to determine a schedule of reinforcement such that behavior is modified. Somehow, I feel this author is culpable when so many people can't get the point--that is, unless his point was to provoke controversy in the first place!"
5,A surprising (an excellent) look at rewards,"I was blown away by this book. I always enjoy reading counterpoints to ""common knowledge"", and Kohn's take on rewards fit the bill perfectly."
2,Bribes are Good,The data in this book provides a solid foundation for analysis. The problem is that author lands on some mis-guided conclusions. People at the end of the day are driven by self interest. Rewards play on that and as a result are generally effective. Kohn tends to dismiss this.
1,I'd like to say something nice...,"But I don't want to bribe ""Alfie"" with stars or a good review. That might be punishing for him! ;-)"
3,Not very good.But an ok scanner.,"Got this Scanner from Officemax about 8 months ago.Worked very well and scanned really fast during the first few months. The scan quality was also good.But now when I open Scan Manager (in Adobe Photoshop), it gives a message that the ""scanner is locked""(which is not the fact) and then the Scanmanager closes down. Then I open it again, it scans the picture.Now if I want to scan another picture, it does the same thing and I have to open the scan manager again. The PaperPort Program that came with it is even worse and closes down anytime.I am rating this product 3 Star cause of the good performance it gave for first few months.But I dont think its that good for long run.Really cheap and decent for a short time use."
5,Beautiful instrumentation and angelic voices,"We've had this CD in our family for over 15 years and it's always a favorite at Christmas time. The orchestration is absolutely beautiful and really makes this album great! The children's choir is excellent, as well! You'll love having this bright, professional, lovely collection of favorite songs in your Christmas repertoire!"
5,A Mediterranean Mosaic,"An interesting book full of good recipes. Quite curiously many of them show a commom ancestry with other mediterranean recipes one finds in books coming from Arab populations such as Lebanese, Syrians, etc. meaning they are probably very old and transmitted from generations to generations before all this insanity between Arabs and Jews was established. Let's hope the two cultures may find a way to live peacefully together."
2,Disappointing,I collect recipe books and was eager to have a look at this book. I found the recipes very mediocre - I'm sorry to say.
1,Poor condition,"Received the replacement battery/handle. Item was filthy, scratched, and with labels improperly affixed. It showed wear and looked to me clearly like a ""returned"" item rather than new. My inquiries to the company were met with ""that's how we receive them"" and ""we assure you it is new."" Regarding the wear marks in the attachment area, ""that's from our testing process."" My 5 year dead old battery looked in better condition. When I asked about returning the item since I was clearly disatisfied, I was given a Return Item Number. No arrangements could be made for pickup by a carrier and I would have to pay for return shipping. VERY disappointed."
2,This must be made in China..,The unit works OK except once the battery is finally installed on the main assembly (took a while to get the battery on the unit when I first assembled it) the battery appears to have glued itself to the main assembly and won't come off. I have to charge it with the main assembly attached. I guess this is no big problem as the unit does work very well and is very handy.
3,right product-wrong address,The product arrived but was sent to my billing address instead of the mailing address that I indicated on the order form and was confirmed on the e-mail receipt. This required a 25-mile special trip to pick it up.
