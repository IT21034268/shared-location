3,Average quality,"I mounted this in the wall yesterday. I'm running 5.1 surround speaker wires through it. The bracket is very thin plastic, but I guess that's needed to get a nice flush finish when you mount to it. The only problem that I've had is that when I mounted the speaker wire connectors to it, one of the screws got stripped in the plastic. I think it's a nice product, I would just recommend being very careful when installing it and mounting connector plates to it."
1,Worst Game Ever,"Now I'm not saying that the Rainbow 6 for PC is bad. The PC game is the best. The Playstation version is the sooooo bad. You go around in first person view.But unlike the PC game you you get a DOOM of Goldeneye type view with the gun on you screen. Some of the levels were changed. It is almost impossible to aim you gun. And there is no planning screen all you do is choose who gos and where they go in. If you played or own the PC or N64 Verson (the N64 wasn't good eather, but it was better) you will be disapointed. It is really a totally different game. I give it one thumb up and one thumb down."
1,Didn't live up to all the hype,"When I bought this I had high expectatitons because how great the PC version was. Boy was I wrong. The enemies look like cardboard and their accuracy is terrible , you probably could walk your dog before they could hit you. The only good part is the sound an exeptional score . Get the soundtrack but not the game.And worst of all the voice overs are very repetitive all your team says is ""Tango down"" and ""got him"". The loadtimes are tremoundous the only good thing is during the load you get to see a man slamming bullets in a clip. What ever you do avoid this peice of junk"
1,"Good intentions, clumsy handling","Those of us out there who are looking for that next Syphon Filter or Metal Gear Solid know a good premise when we hear one. As a fan of the novel I was interested in this game. I should have rented it beforehand. The graphics and control are miserably sub-standard for this system. It could have been so much more with some 3-D drama sequences, a story as captivating as the novel was, to drive the action. But instead we got a game that handles like a car with four tires put on crooked and a blurry windshield. Leave it be and go play Syphon Filter/MGS/Medal of Honor."
2,Doesn't live up to the original PC version of the game,"Rainbow Six is a HUGE game on the PC, too bad the Playstation version is LESS THAN MEDIOCRE. Targeted at Teen to Adult, this version falls way short from the popular PC version. Do yourself a favor, buy Medal of Honor instead. Maybe Playstation 2 will have the heat to give this title justice...it sure isn't worth it on the Playstation console."
1,watching paint dry is more fun that this game,"Its plodding, poorly controlling, ugly, and more importantly not at all fun, I can't honestly think of one positive thing to say about this game.. well except that I was lucky and only wasted money on a rental instead of buying this piece of trash, maybe its great on the PC but for playstation.. its JUNK"
2,baaaad game,"allthough I dont own this game, I have played it. And let me tell you it is an annoying game. Take this for example, you have to hold L1 and square (or something like that) just to open a door! Then (scince it has no auto aiming!) oyu have to press R1 or R2 just to aim your weapon! It is a pain. I can't even count how many times I've died because of the baaad controls. The game is too easy. Besides the controls (which make it hard) the missions take about five minutes to get through (if you can get past the controls that is) over all this is a horrible game. Buy it for computer or N64 (computer is best) and be happy. See this game, run far away very fast."
2,deformed,i agree with others that the terroist are deformed. its fun to shoot the terroist but still its a bad game
1,damn.....,"this game sucked,it was the worst game i ever played iv seen my dog fart and it was alot more entertainingDONT BUY THIS GAME!"
1,THE worst game I've ever played...,"I played the demo for the pcversion. And I loved it. So when I bought Rainbow Six I thought that it might not look as good as the pc version, but it could still play like a dream(like Quake2). Boy...was I wrong. This game is not only the most ugliest game ever to be produced on the psx, it is also without any gameplay. The animations, if you can call them that, are choppy. AND WHY did they turned it into another doom-clone.....I instantly returned the game and bought the fantastic FF8. Without a doubt, Rainbow Six is the worst game I have ever played in my whole life(even worse than 'dragonheart'!)"
2,Rainbow Six.......Medal of Honor wanna be!,"This game was pretty terrible. Controling and aiming the guns were terrible. Graphics were poor at best, and the most bothersome thing was when your fellow personell or hostages were to follow you, you couldn't back track. They won;t let you pass beyond them. Go get Medal of Honor, way better game play. Rainbow six was boring, and plain out annoying to play. Good concept, they just didn't pull it off."
2,I can't believe I spent money on this game.,Not nearly as good as the PC version. I suggest you just buy the PC version if you have a computer and if not rent the game first. Just make sure you play the game first and know what it is like before you buy it.
5,"THE BEST GAME, Rainbow Six","Rainbow Six for the computer was a totally cool game. Now that it is a video game it is great. The action in this game is intense and and missions are so good. The story line to this game is great and i know anyone who liked GoldenEye would totally love this game, i do. And 2 player action is very good. There is no bad points to this game except how adictive it is."
5,top of the line,this game is one of the best i've played for the playstaion. it's MUCH MUCH better then Syphon Filter and 007. it's also more realistic the SF and 007.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,"If you have heard anything good about Rainbow Six from Reviewers and such, that was about the PC game. They changed soooo much for this PSX conversion and it was all bad. B-A-D BADBADBADBAD. The levels bite, the planing stage is all messed up. All you can do is put three guys (In the PC vesian you get like 8) where they enter the building. In the PC version you tell your teams,(yes, teams) where to go once they're inside the building. The terrorist couldn't hit the sky with a shotgun, their aim is so bad. And your buddies are all deformed. You deserve so much better. Get the PC game. And if all you have is a PSX, get Rouge Spear for the PSX. That is very good and an excact dupicate of the PC Rouge Spear, which is even better than the PC Rainbow SIX. DONT GET THIS GAME AVOID LIKE SHIVA!"
1,"DISGRASE TO CLANCY, AND PLAYSTATION","I recently rented this game. I played it once and it SUCKED. The graphics remind you of an old atari game. The controls are so hard to control I practically broke my controller trying to turn a corner. Another thing, if you see a terrorist it takes you at least 6 seconds to aim at him! This has got to be the most horrible game I have every played in the 10 yrs. of my gaming life. I would rather start playing my old NES then this HORRIBLE GAME!"
5,Rainbow six or bust,I think the grapics were good but selection of weapons was soperb. you'd have to point the enimies gun a you're head before they hit you. the sound was good. not enough shooting and bullets the shigun is king i once killed three guys with one blast.but what do i know i'm only 10. All i'm tring to say is rent it first.
1,Anything but on Playstation,"This game has a good plot and gameplay, as you get to run around killing people... (it's fun to me!) and the sounds are remarkable... but those few things are not enough to save the game from the crappy graphics it has. The suits are so pixelated that their body and face looks like they have a bunch of square pimples. THE GRAPHICS ARE VERY BAD... if that factor doesn't bother you then it is a very fun game... graphics influence me a lot!"
4,Classic game,This definitely is a classic game in its genre. I played it a lot when I was a kid and decided to start collecting my old favorites before eventually they disappear.
4,A talent waiting to be discovered,"I discovered this book while doing a web search for new horror written by relatively unknown writers. I ordered a copy and was not disappointed. The author definitely knows how to spin a good yarn, and her writing skills are solid. All in all a very entertaining pair of stories. I look forward to more from her."
5,Wonderful book!,Terrific book that really engaged our new reader. She loved the lyrical rhythm and repitition. I definitely recommend it as a read aloud book for small children and a great learn to read book for older children. We loved both A House for Miss Mouse and Counting on Friends. Well done!
2,A Stranger Is Not Watching,"This movie caught my attention with it's name, ""A Stranger Is Watching"", more or less because I enjoy a good horror movie. This movie had none of that. What you get is mostly a very uninteresting movie about a killer with a good chase scene coming too late to redeem this uninspired B-movie.The only true suspense was wondering when it would ever get off the ground and really get interesting. Long story short, it never happened, the best part of the movie was the title."
4,A woman's voice,"Some women have a voice that goes straight to the heart and touches the soul. Donna Hughes, Alison Krauss, Sarah McLachlan, Alison Krauss, Enya, Alison Krauss..."
2,ehh. not the best,The best part is the cute girl on the cover.Most of this CD is a let down. There are much better new comersout there...but i must give all bluegrassers credit and supporttheir efforts.
5,Berner Men Rule!,"This calendar is perhaps the most hilarious feat yet accomplished by Berners and their men.For those who may not know, the 'men' displayed so affectionately in this calendar are actually, really owned by a Berner (or four). These men are either very active in our Berner community and/or they're married to a woman who is very active in our Berner community.Yes, this means they've earned their right to shed their clothes on behalf of our breed's best interest.And their loyalty to the Bernese Mountain Dog breed can certainly never be questioned.Their sanity? Now that's a dog of a solid color."
5,This is the first rational book to address the probability..,of life elsewhere inthe universe.I read it first sometime in the late Sixties or early Seventies as an undergrad in engineering/physics/math. Carl Sagan created a wonderful book which has stayed with me over the course of almost 30 years now.Tim Niles
1,Very dissapointed,"I bought this for my grandson. Within the first hour, the hood on the front of the helicopter fell off, one of the side rockets stopped working, and the helicopter blades wouldn't stay in position. The torpedos have a tendency to get jammed also. I would not reccomend this toy for anyone."
5,"Great product, hours of fun.",More than what I expected and my five year old has not put them down. They come with fun extras and the spiderman doll that fits in each cockpit. My seven year old daughter plays with him since there are two (car and helicopter). Great enjoyment and so far it hasn't gotten old yet. Even my one year old likes them (as often as he can get a hold of them!)
4,"High energy, Andean music - traditional instruments","Without getting into individual cuts from the CD, this album magically combines several Andean pan flutes and a traditional Bolivian stringed instrument with interesting vocals. Although the album is more sophisticated than the music played by Bolivian and Peruvian street musicians, the haunting pan flute runs and well harmonized vocals are very reminisant of the traditional music."
4,EVERYbody loved Animals Nobody Loves,"Story time with 23 preschool students can be wiggly, easily-interrupted time, but this book kept them rooted. The close-up pictures of icky or scary beasties had them wide-eyed and slack-jawed and even the ones who would lose their voices when asked any other questions were willing to chime in about if they would want this or that animal in their house (or bed, or bathtub) and why not. The pictures are big and fascinating. The information is real, no fairytale talking monsters here, and that is intriguing to them as well. I kept the book for a week and went a few days before showing it again. I was impressed with how well they remembered the information about each animal and it led to them requesting more books about whatever their favorite had been, shark, spider, bat, etc. It's well worth a read or two or three!"
3,animals nmobody loves,I dindn't realoize this was for children when I purchased it. For kids it's very good but for adults not worth th money in my opinion. Very thin and simple .
4,Tomorrow is Today,"Great band. I like band with heavy guitar and pounding drums, and this band has both. Produced by Travis Wyrick and helped by Michael Betts of former Rugged Records. Great sounding tracks - really not a bad song on the CD. 12 songs - good mix of rockers & ballads. You won't be disappointed with this purchase."
1,Dorf Da Bingo King,This video is a complete waste of time and money. It is totally unfunny and stupid. There are maybe two real laughs in the whole video!
5,Your kids need this book!,"This book shows children that one person can make a positive impact on the world, and that God is with them even during the bad times of their lives. It was Squanto's faith in God that helped him forgive Europeans for kidnapping him, and it was his faith in God that made him decide to help the Pilgrims. The spiritual aspect of Squanto's life is too important to leave out when we pass this story down to our children."
5,Very nice,"This is an excellent book for teaching the history of Thanksgiving. The story is well told, and the writing is well crafted. The pictures are remarkable; you can spend a lot of time looking into the faces of the characters, which are rich with emotion and humanity and realism. This book is a great investment."
5,Eric Metaxis is so flexible,"So glad to get the real history of this warrior. Got the video and showed to my grandkids and church kids for Thanksgiving.Thank you, Eric Metaxis"
5,Providence!,God is still working! So happy to have a resource of how God worked things together for His plan and our good!
5,Squanto,"This is a delightful book that tells the incredible story of a Native American who really helped thePilgrims. Squanto has been under acclaimed in my opinion and this book brings his increcible storyto light. I was thrilled the book arrived in great shape, very quickly, in good packaging and at avery fair price."
5,Great book for school,This is a great book to share at school in November. My class really liked it and understood who Squantomwas.
1,More Trash from Bill,"I can't wait for Bill to write more books. It seems that every topic he writes about he claims that he was once a member of and should therefore know the truth. When he wrote ""Wicca: Satan's little white lie"" he was a former Wiccan high priest. Now that he is writing about Catholicism he is a former seminarian. At this point I am just praying that he never writes a book about strippers. If this was a thousand year old secret of the Catholic church doesn't it seem a little odd that they would teach it to a young seminarian? Wouldn't you assume that such a secret would be guarded and shared with only the highest ranking members of their clergy? Just a little food for thought."
1,insanity,Where do you come up with so much nonesense??? Look at the true history of Catholic Christianity.....why do you make up false truths....it sounds like you have hate in your heart for christians of other denominations if they do not agree with you...whomever buys this junk just think of it as entertainment.....
1,Total garbage,"Extremely cheap, the display was messed up and when I squeezed it, it would temporarily be fixed. I didn't even bother to return this, just threw it away and accepted the loss."
2,"SLOW! slow paced, not funny, not exciting","Extremely slow paced, even the action scenes have seemingly endless moments of no action.Someone must have thought this was suspense or funny. Total miss.Just a lousy movie overall; not ""the worst"" I've ever seen, but one thatis dull, lifeless, non-witty, and has nothing I can recommend.Not funny, not silly, not scary or spooky; just dull, dim witted, generic.I like the genre, like ""Mr Vampire"" which is great, and I usuallylike the star ""Samo Hung"" in other films, but this is just a waste of time.And the actor's lines repeat themselves over and over again.It does have nice lighting, sets, and audio; but otherwise all 3rd rate.I hope your fast forward button runs at 32x."
1,I can't believe I actually bought this,"I don't know what's written on the english box, but on the DVD-box I have it says ""Amazing 30 minutes ending fight"", but as the movie ended I still haven't seen that fight yet... During the whole movie there were like 2-3 fights, only one of the worth watching...I don't count the fights against the mummy for fights, since all he did was jump around avoiding the mummyIf you like to watch two sourceres (sp?) keep throwing fireballs at each other, this movie might be something for you, but if you're looking for just a little bit horror, comedy or martial arts, then go look somewhere else, since this movie contains none of those elements :(Sammo Hung is among the best martial arts actors in the world, so I can't believe he would ever do something like this :("
4,a hidden table of contents for the collection,"This is very confusing.When you first open the ""collection"" it starts on the cover page for ""A Study In Scarlet"" and it appears that there is no table of contents to the other books.You can't find the TOC by doing a menu --> go to --> ""table of contents"" -- It is greyed out.Instead do menu --> go to --> coverThat takes you to the real toc.Five stars for the content -1 star for hiding the table of contents."
4,For Kindle users who've read previous reviews,"The Kindle version of this DOES have a table of contents. In fact it has several which is probably why it is not linked from the Kindle's menu. When you open this in Kindle it starts on the first page of A Study in Scarlet, but if you press the previous button a few times you'll find not only the TOC (with working links) for this novel but going further, a TOC link to each book in the volume. I've also created bookmarks for the TOC's so I can find each of them easily (a personal quirk). As far as the content of the books, what can I say? It's Sherlock Holmes! You won't be disappointed. --Another happy Kindle customer :D"
3,Interesting,It's pretty good. Not as engaging as other Sherlock Holmes. Formatting issues. Typical of some early period writings one finds difficulty with the racist comments toward black people. N- word used briefly.
3,Need to improve packaging,"Not totally happy. The paper cover of this hard-cover book was torn, due to poor packaging :-("
2,Book Design Poor,"This is a very cheaply designed volume of paste and cardboard, most of the really good editions of ""Sherlock Holmes"" have gone out of print. Publishers today produce disposable junk, especially when there aren't many readers in the U.S.A. the most illiterate country in the western world. The Amazon reviewer is a liar which comes naturally from a corporation known for graft, he also manages to compact political correctness while dismissing these classic books as trivial at the same time."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!,this book turns into the book of mormon at the end of the first story (before they tell you who did it)! don't waste your time!!
1,Not truly kindle ready,I don't understand reviews that state this has a wonderful indexing system for the kindle. It only takes you from the main table of contents to the beginning of each collection. You must then page to each individual story. Technology is much better than this when implemented. It is not implemented well for this collection. I bought this based on the good reviews of the indexing. I would gladly pay several dollars more for a well indexed collection.
2,Table of Contents Fail,"Kindle: It could be because I had to transfer the book from my computer via USB (I doubt it), but the table of contents and links did not work for me. I agree that the formatting is kind of strange. I don't recommend this version.Sherlock Holmes: An amazing series!"
2,Could have been great but...,"This was the first Kindle book I bought. I have the stories, of course, all of them, but I really wanted the complete collection on my Kindle--it's one of the great things with the Kindle, the fact that you can carry all of your favourites with you and still get by an overnight packing. A safe bet, I figured.As far as the stories go, it was. But this particular version is let down by poor formatting, with broken lines mid page and with illustrations cut in half, and by a table of contents that is only partly working. What good is link to a short story when the link leads you to... the beginning of the collection in which the story first appeared? Useless and annoying. Yes, it's cheap but so isSherlock Holmes Illustrated and Complete, and it's got perfect formatting and all of the illustrations, plus an introduction, notes, and more. Buy it instead."
2,"Complete text, poor formating, no TOC","It was my first original Kindle book bought from Amazon and I'm disappointed. Text formatting is terrible, pictures are sometimes split in two pages and what is worst the book doesn't contain native Kindle TOC. The book contains only hyperlink TOC at the book beginning (only two thirds of links work) so forget about smart Kindle TOC navigation you have learned from Kindle user manual. The book should obtain also ""footnotes"" but, they don't work either so book is full of ""dead"" marks e.g. [xx]."
5,Anthor Great work,"When Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, first sat down to write the adventures of Sherlock Holmes his intention was to mealy build up an income to support his historical wirtings, and he little imagend the sucess the collection would bring. Not only are the stories contanted in this volume entertaning but to those who can read bettween the lines educational. I eagerly recommend thease works to any reader of simple great literature."
1,Kindle version review,"This kindle version is practically unusable. There is no indication in the TOC which stories are stories or where the novels are ... and I don't see a way to even get to the TOC without doing a word search for ""table""."
3,Poor binding on Doubleday hardcover edition,"To be a well-rounded person, you must read the wonderful stories of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. You will be amazed by the number of English expressions and culural assumptions that originate in these stories.The Doubleday hardcover binding was atrocious, however. I bought this edition to read completely cover-to-cover, so I concede the edition was in for some heavy use. But the bound pages began to separate from the cover on the first day. By the time I was done. the cover was separated, and the bound pages had fallen into a number of chunks. Even the title print on the spine had been struck twice and appeared sloppy. The book was damaged beyond usefulness after one reading.Read the stories, but don't get the Doubleday hardcover."
5,WE SEE BUT DON'T OBSERVE.,I have read and re-read Sherlock Holmes stories for over 40 years. Each story taught me something more about paying attention to my surroundings. I think these stories had a positive affect on my careers and friendships.
3,Content vs Binding,"This my first foray into Holmes and I am thoroughly enjoying it. My only complaint is that the binding of this edition is beginning to come apart, in spite of gentle treatment. And I had bought this edition rather than the paperback because many large paperbacks have this very problem!"
2,TOC link is dead and text colors render incorrectly,"I'm disappointed about two things: 1) the TOC isn't set up correctly 2) text color isn't formatted correctly. As another reviewer noted, the TOC doesn't work - when you select ""Go to"", the TOC option is greyed out. When using iPod, Android, iPhone, Mac Kindle software with white text on black background - the TOC, chapter headings, and some chapters become unreadable (dark grey text on black background)."
1,It's all one giant paragraph,"I had purchased this book (physical copy) for my niece, who begged and pleaded with Santa to get the complete Sherlock Holmes collection. Reading the reviews here, I figured this was a good deal. Imagine my surprise when the book arrived, and I leafed through it. The text is tiny. Tiny, tiny, tiny. And not a single paragraph break at all. Every story, every novel is one long giant paragraph. How in the holy heck is someone supposed to read this?"
2,Poor quality book,"Very poor quality book. It feels like home made cheap copy.I got an impression, that it is printed using regular laser printer on letter size paper.The worst thing is that there is no single page number which makes full table of content completely useless. Imagine finding necessary page in two-three hundred page book which doesn't have page numbers... I'm I supposed to count those pages?"
3,IT's a big book,"It's a beautiful book but huge, hard to just sit and read but is a great coffee table or set-out book. I think I'll order the books l at a time."
1,Cannot be used,"I'm quite frustrated. This version is a nightmare. It is impossible to go to different short-stories as every single link within a collection leads you to the BEGINNING of the collection not of the story you are looking for. Moreover, you cannot use the search-function here. I deleted this version after half an hour of stabbing at buttons."
3,Classic,"I knew what to expect in the book, what I loved was purchasing it via the Kindle App on my iPad"
1,Sherlock Holmes,I read about three chapters and quit. I obviously do not relate or appreciate this style of writing. I would like to sell it back!
2,Flawed but useful for the surveys.,"The title is misleading. There is no such thing as ""POD Publishing"" POD is a printing process available directly fromfirms such as LSI, or indirectly through a subsidy house. What this book discusses is subsidy publishing. The author holds a position with Infinity.com, a well-known subsidy publisher.The widespread prejudice in the industry against subsidy published books is never discussed. Subsidy publishing makes it easy to print books but hard to sell them. Reviewers, libraries, bookstores etc. will generally not consider books with a subsidy imprint. The alternative is true self publishing, which involves dealing directly with a printer, either POD or offset, but this option is never discussed in this lengthy book.The value of this book is in the surveys the author has conducted among those who used subsidy publishing, and what they would do differently if they had it to do all over."
2,Rehash of original Fighter Destiny,"If you already have the original Fighters Destiny, do not buy this one. Very little new features, and the players have most of the same moves as in the first one, except their features are different.I was disappointed."
5,Fighters Destiny2,"this game is a what time is it game it keeps you up till like 6:00 A.M.! this game is perfect for kids 11-about16! I think this is a one good game I shold know I,m a kid!"
2,Too many errors,"Even before the Table of Contents, there is an assurance from the ""Program Director"" that the book has been ""carefully reviewed to assure accuracy"", and yet the very first thing I happened to read when browsing (Example 1 in Section 3.9) had two errors in the equation. In books that spend more time on examples and explanation, a student might notice a typo or two, but particularly in such an abbreviated book as this, a typo can be very bewildering if you don't already know the material."
4,An interesting story and an easy read.,"I thought the use if the 1989 San Francisco earthquake and the ensuing problems was a very interesting vehicle for starting the story and then weaving the murder investigation in between the aftershocks and other dilemmas. I enjoyed the interaction between the two private investigators, Brandon Harrison and Tina Wolff, and their relationship with San Francisco police detective, Harry Garth. The book is an easy and enjoyable read...and, if you've lived through any earthquakes, it will rekindle some old emotions."
1,inferior dvd and not solid enough info,"The instructor is obviously a great martial artist, but there's too much filler, not enough instruction, and the DVD kept stalling my DVD player. I feel that this is not a good DVD from a technical or a martial arts instructional perspective."
3,Fly Pentop Fly Games,"This is a nice little supplement to the Pentop Computer system. It's in booklet form so it's easy to bring along when kids need something to do to keep them busy. I had fun with it, too. It's not a fantastic product. But, it's a good one that serves it's purpose. Just to be more fun than sitting around doing nothing."
1,Venomous,"Amira Hass is to be commended for bravely moving to Gaza and writing a book about the people there.However, this book isn't going to help people of Gaza.One of the problems in Gaza is the Arab war against Jewish rights. This has poisoned relations among Jews and Arabs. Blaming all this on the Israel and thus promoting more of the same, as Hass does, is not good for anyone. Instead, it sabotages what could have been an effort to promote human rights for everyone in the region. Meanwhile, the author's bias against Israel makes the book unreliable."
5,Beautifully played - Glorious sound,"This is a formidable interpretation by Mr. Abbado, as he showed us in his recent DVD of the Lucerne FestivalBruckner/Beethoven - Symphony No. 7, Piano Concerto No. 3, Alfred Brendel, Claudio Abbado. But here the sonics are much better, and the Wiener Philharmoniker shines through like no other orchestra. This 7th it's sure one of the best, together with Karajan and Haitink."
4,Nice gift,I bought these for my mom who doesn't like heavy earrings. They were perfect and a nice size. I loved the quality of them too.
5,Outstanding small stand light,"I bought six of these lights to use in a pit band, and we all love them, mainly for two outstanding qualities. One is the size - they are really tiny (and mildly blue), so they don't add a big black blob above the stand and they don't need gels to shield them from the audience, but the lights are bright enough and the two 'antennae' are so flexible they can light both pages of a full-sized score well. The second is how they use their three AAA batteries. Instead of suddenly leaving you in the dark, after about 15 hours' use they begin to dim just a little, which allows you to change batteries during a break instead of in a mad dash when you should be playing."
3,"Very good, but...","I have no complaints about the light itself, but it does NOT come with an AC adapter or an input for external power. Very disappointed about that."
3,Some more light,"Purchased four of these lights for my string quartet. We were performing on an island on the coast of Maine and knew from past experience that lighting would be an issue since there is no electricity there. The building we played in was quite dark, and while these lights were helpful, we could have used a lot more light. I liked the flexibility of the antenna, and the clip stayed on the metal stands without a problem. More powerful lights, and it would be perfect."
4,Does the job pretty well...,A decent little light for your music stand... could be a little brighter but does OK.
4,Works well,"The duet works well. I am a freelance musician (violinist) and I used it for a wedding rehearsal that was outside, after dark, under a park picnic shelter which had no other lighting available. (Unusual circumstances.) It performed well for a small light. It is very compact and folds well for easy storage. Unlike the older version I had previously for the single Mighty Bright, I like the idea that it can be placed easily in a pocket in my instrument case without taking up too much room. But like the other Mighty Brights, the coverage for lighting is not quite as good as a full bar electric florescent stand light. It is a good substitute however, for situations that require wireless set ups. I recommend it."
1,Poor Lighting,The only thing mighty about this light is it's dimness. This works only for pianists who have already memorized the score and like playing in the dark. I can't believe how many good reviews this product has received. Either the products has changed or the reviews were all written by employees of the company that manufactures them. I am now on the market for device that emits actual rays of light.
2,not bright enough,"These are decent portable lights, however they are not bright enough. They will work in dark areas, but in areas with dim to moderate light these are not powerful enough. They are battery powered and the batteries last awhile but for the light output this is Negligible. The lights are flexible and I like the clip, but overall a poor product."
3,Mighty Bright Duet Stand Light,"The light did eliminate complaints from the audience regarding glare from the stand lights. However, out of seven musicians using the Duet stand light, only one would use it again without reservation. Several found the light adequate, but it did not light up the entire page satisfactorily when all the house lights were turned off. The clip on the light worked very well and the light was easy to position. It would be great to know how many lumens the light produced for comparison purposes."
2,Does not meet expectations,"I purchased this music stand light in order to better illuminate my sheet music stand for practicing. I found that the Mighty Bright Duet was not as bright as I had hoped. While the clamp and the bendable parts were of good construction I found that the light parts were not. The switches on top seem very delicate and the left LED light flickers on and off so poorly that it is now unusable. The product was new and only lasted a few days before I removed it due to its ineffectiveness.I am not sure if this is common amongst Mighty Bright products or if I just received a poor model, but I will not be a return customer to any Mighty Bright products. I would rather pay a little extra to get a better quality product."
4,I'm already brighter because of it!,I'm a full time guitar instructor specializing in beginner and intermediate guitar students.I use the Mighty Bright every day and have found it to be the best product like it on the market.Mark FisherThe Howlinfish School of Guitar[...]
4,2 lights makes all the difference,"I bought this for my wife, so she can see her harp & cello music. Having 2 lights makes all the difference, as she can adjust both lights to shine on one page, if she needs it. Also, they are flexible enough that she can adjust them to maximize her light on her sheet music. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is I wish they were just a little bit brighter."
5,Works great!,"When attached to my music stand, his device completely solves all lighting problems when playing a gig in poorly light conditions."
3,Meh,"I bought this as a clip on for a music stand while playing guitar. While it does the trick it could stand to be a little brighter. Battery life is not that great either. If you dont want to spend 50 bucks or more on a stand light however, then this will probably work for you."
3,Not as bright as the Super GigLight,I bought both the Mighty Bright XtraFlex Duet Super LED light as well as the SUper GigLight. The Mighty Bright Duet is rather dim by comparing to the Super Giglight. However it is about 60% cheaper. I have just noticed that Mighty Bright has a new Duet light out with 4 instead of 2 LEDs. Perhaps I should return the one I have and order the new model instead.
1,"Not ""Mighty Bright""","I'm an adult taking music lessons and bought this based on recommendations here, and also because it's cordless, and I like to move my music stand around and practice in various locations, including out on the porch at night (in nice weather). I'm frankly very disappointed with the strangely faint blue light this casts on the sheet music. One or the other of the lights went out several times as I moved the heads around to illuminate dark spots on the sheet music. Then, after only 9-10 hours total use, it appears the batteries (the recommended high quality ones) have died. Strangely, my music teacher bought one after I did, and he told me he didn't like the light either. Based on reviews of other stand lights, I think I'm buying a cheap, goose-necked, plug-in clamp lamp for this purpose, and giving up on the high tech solutions."
5,what a life saver!!!!,"a must-have for any performing musician with a music stand! lighting in most stages, no matter what size, and rehearsal rooms too, is usually poor for reading! And don't think it's a luxury not to have to re-direct the light every time you need it shining on the other page!"
2,so so,"The lights are not very bright and one of my lights does not stay lit and with turn off with stage vibration. I am going to buy a heavier duty, and brighter light for use on stage"
3,not bright enough,"This light is very easy to put on the music stand and hold steady. However, I wish the light is brighter."
4,Mighty Bright Duet Music Stand Light,"In general, a useful product. The light isn't as bright as I would like, but I'm at the age where these things matter. I like not being tethered to an electrical cord, and the lights are easy on batteries, typically lasting for hours between battery changes. I would definitely purchase them again."
1,Not bright and cheaply made,This light is simply NOT bright and it is certainly cheaply made. You get what you pay for!!!
1,Pretty much worthless,"It feels like a short in the wiring or something, because the lights flicker badly. You can get them to stay on if you fuss with them, but then they're not bright enough to do any real good. A poorly designed product."
2,Waste of time,"She shoutsShe can't sing liveShe has no looks what so everBut with an outstanding voice coach, loads of technical work, lots of buttons, loads of machines and crazy fans, Avril Lavigne has made it to the top with a voice that isn't hers. Like her, don't like the album, don't think she can sing. Well, why is she a star? God only knows, but good luck to her and good luck to you if you buy this album. Keep it down though or you may be hearing from the neighbours. I know a lot of people that would complain just to have a pic of her in the house. Poor girl. At least she has her so called fans. Her strange fans who think she can sing. Her strange fans who believe her Grandad is dead and she actually wrote a song about it. Anyway, back to the album. Don't buy it. Keep ur valuable dollars and save them to sign the protest to bring her out of the charts. It's for her own good. We would be saving her from embarrasment. No offence Avril!"
1,Why such rage?,"How can you Avril fans enjoy something as vile as Avril Lavigne's music? Its just so harsh and aggressive...every song is packed full of hate from one end to the other. Loud, noisy, aggressive and bitter, Avril screams out loud in furious expressions of rage and frustration. She sounds like she wants to kill somebody! The noisy guitars are played at deafening volume, making the anger and agression twice as bad. You Avril fans need to start listening to positive, optimistic music. Now I know you probably think of all optimistic music as ""cheesy"" or ""manufactured"", but you're wrong. Just because a song is subtle and finely crafted rather than aggessive, noisy trash does not mean it is cheesy. DOn't listen to Avril Lavigne. Its way too negative."
1,OMG,"I can't believe I used to listen to this fool. Avril Lavigne is such a horrible singer, and she CAN NOT sing live. I am really against Avril Lavigne. I just don't really know why I hate her...but I do. Sorry, this review is not very helpful."
3,an ok cd,"i think this cd is ok....so far i have listened to it a couple times and its not great. but its also not bad, i recomend u buy it."
2,quite a disappointment,"I purchased Avril's 1st album for my 8 year old daughter - didn't expect much, but that record was wonderful. The sounds were interesting, her voice was well recorded, the songs were good and the playing was terrific. It was like a textbook on how to make an interesting new pop/rock record. This new record is so inferior that it makes me wonder about the inside story. The sounds are mediocre, the songs are poor, the performnaces by the guitar players are subaverage - not the same band. Even Avril's voice is not recorded the same way - and the creative uses of harmony and looping are not there. Sophomore slump or something else?"
1,Horrible!,"I thought ""Don't Tell Me"" was gonna be the weakest song on the album but I was wrong most of the song's are realy not good,many song's sound worse then ""Don't Tell Me"" the only song that is decent is ""My Happy Ending"" other then that this CD is dissapointing considering this is her follow up from her great ""Let Go"" album!This album was a waist of money!"
3,avril lavigne-under my skin,i have bought this album of hers and the album wasn't really the best album she made.it didn't sound like her other albums that she made.i only like a few songs off the album but other than that i thought the album wasn't really her best.people can buy this album and give their own opinion's to what they think of this album of hers. sincerly chrisfan.
5,Avril's Done It Again!,"Avril Lavigne is one of the best singers I know, and I love the lyrics she writes. This album was fantastic!Take Me Away-10/10 My favourite for a long time. I identify with feeling unable to control my thoughts and how painful it is in this case.Together-10/10 It's sweet and sad, and full of feeling. Need I say more?Don't Tell Me-8/10 Pretty, I guess, but while it's popular, it's not that great, even if it is a single.He Wasn't-7/10. More so than ""Don't Tell Me"".How Does It Feel-9/10 Drags on for far too long, but I love the idea behind the song.My Happy Ending 11/10 Seriously, what's not to love?Nobody's Home-10/10 I sometimes feel this way. How does Avril get into my head like this?Forgotten-6/10 Just a bit boring.Who Knows-6/10. OK, but a bit boring.Fall To Pieces-8/10 I don't really get Avril's idea, but I love the song.Freak Out-10/10 Love it!Slipped Away-7/10 It's just a little hard to get into.I Always Get What I Want 7/10 The idea's boring, but I like the song."
4,"Whiny, or Truthful?","I Had trouble differentiating the truthfullness and the constant bashing on men in this album. True, guys can be jerks, but girls can be, too. The album was awesome, I'll give her that. I'm a big fan, and ""Take me Away"" and ""Together"" are awesome, but sometimes she goes down on guys too much. I want a love song. Doesn't have to be a ballad, just about a working relationship. I do recommend this to punk-rock lovers. The plus is that this album isn't the 1950's perfect love fantasies sung by Elvis Presley. It is truthfull. You decide."
3,Not as good as Let Go,"I bought Let Go last year, and loved it. Then I recently got this one, and I liked it okay. The songs mostly sound the same, and Avril totally changed her sound and her style of singing. Yeah, the lyrics are a little more mature, I'll give her that. But in my opinion, Let Go is much better.My personal favorites on this album are Don't Tell Me, How Does it Feel, My Happy Ending, and Freak Out.I would reccomend this to Avril fans, but buy Let Go first, if you haven't already."
1,Dire,"Firstly Avril Lavigne has done a great job, lets face it, anyone who can do something completely un-natural to themselves, and earn millions is a genius.I understand she was a country and western singer before her producer told her, 'look the best way to earn millions is to become a completely fake bimbo with the wrong label, but the right audience', or something like that anyway, then she replied, 'no, I love my country singing, please, please,' then, 'Enough! You shall be a punk rock star who sings about skater boys, OK?', 'I suppose so,' I'm not sure if thats 100% accurate, but I heard it through the 'punk rock' grapevine. So, here we are, with yet another talentless person making WAY TOO MUCH MONEY.Just another manufactured suburban lil gal."
1,Avril----a great talent and sexy too!,"Avril Lavigne is a wonderfully sophisticated, erudite lady of the old school whose continental charms and gentle, poignent lyrics (especially those about kicking her boyfriend's .@.$.$.). add so much musically, culturally, and morally to our civilisation. Furthermore, she's also incredibly sexy, sort of in a supermodel like way don't you think? What a romantic, so lovely and ladylike. Classically beautiful: move over Cindy Crawford, get lost Christy Turlington, forget it Linda Evangilista. Here's a real babe of a woman...Avril. A real charmer! Hey, has she assaulted anybody this week?"
1,you have got to be kidding me,"What is with Avril? I agree with Jon Won, she claims not in the punk scene and is singing about skaters. Please Avril, just stop."
1,this cd should be in the toilet,"This cd sucks a$$, here we have another person trying to make everybody she hardcore with her image and dressing all punk. Don't let this fool you and don't make the mistake of buying this cd. I would just like to leave you with these four words AVRIL LAVIGNE SUCKS A$$!"
1,your not a rebel!!!!,"Your a lousy, rich, mtv sellout punk. What the heck are you rebeling against? Your rich, have everything you need and your singing songs about feeling so sorry for yourself! GET A LIFE AVRIL LAVIGNE FANS, SHES CORNY AND FAKE! GO BUY REAL ROCK! Smashing Pumpkins and U2 would be a good place to start.Avril Lavigne is fake punk pretending thinking shes so original when she barely writes her own songs. So if your a fan then i feel very very sorry for you. (fyi, limbizkit and good charlotte fall under fake MTV punks as well)"
1,I wish Avril was dead!,"I was just listening to our local ""Light Rock"" radio station, and when I heard Avril Lavigne screeching like a cat with its balls caught in a vice, it gave me an idea. I think it would be mega awesome if someone bashed Avril's head in! Just think, there would be no more juvenile delinquent music!No longer would us real music fans have to suffer through Avril's bratty, suburban, juvenile delinquent songs. Radio stations would go back to REAL music that isn't aimed at juvenile delinquents. No longer would our ears be assaulted with Avril Lavigne's anguished cries every time we turn on a radio. We would never have to hear ""WHYAHAFTA GO N MAKE EVERYTHING COMPLICAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYDID!!!"" again. Her anguished cries of ""the pain inside"" would become a thing of the past.A future without Avril Lavigne! That would be almost as good as world peace!"
1,Simple music for simple people,"Simple music for simple people, thats the way I see it. Why does everybody praise Avril Lavigne for her songwriting ability? Do you REALLY think it takes talent to come up with lyrics like ""Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh/My life's like this/Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh/That's the way it is""? I've never heard such simple rhyme patterns.And the subject matter of her songs is SO irratating and whiney! Every song is the same thing--just whine and complain about how awful life is. Is THIS why people think Avril is better than Britney Spears??? I'm no fan of hers, but at least there was no miserable angst in her songs. The overwhelming negativity in all of Avril's songs is just painful! She just sounds so bitter and miserable. Yet everybody else just LOVES this bitter complaint rock. They think it's ""honest"" and ""mature"". I hate it."
1,Even my 11 year old sister got over her crappy music,"last week i asked my sister ,shes 11, why dont you have the ""avril lavigne tie"" anymore? she said ""avril lavigne is stupid. all her songs talk about love and crap like that. the tie was dumb too. nobody at my school likes her anymore""avril is another britney clone in the form of ""punk rock""wasn't punk all about the music back in the 70s? not about fashion or image. dickies and a tie dont = punk rock.my 11 year old sister realized how crappy this is, you can too.check out real classic punk and rockac/dc iron maiden the misfits the ramones metallica led zeppelin and the doors"
4,Wow! Avril has really grown up...watch out Alanis!,"This CD is amazing and shows that Avril as really grown up! She's only 19, and the lyrics and music are very real. I'm not an Avril fan, and when I first heard the lead single ""Don't Tell Me"" I didn't think her sophomore album would succeed. But after I went to MTV.com and listened to the full album, my opinion totally changed. This is a new sound than her previous album and it's not as teenage as her previous CD. There's so many moving songs on here that will give you goosebumps, especially ""Nobody's Home""...Go Avril and go buy this amazing album!"
1,Under My Skin is Under Your Stupidity.,"Under My Skin is another album by avril lavigne, and believe it's another stupid alternative garbage, she is not punksongs are terrible, the writing is horrible and the writingis once again ridiculous, I'll be glad this so-called sk8ter punkera is over just like rap rock/nu metal pop punk trashisUnder my skin is an early canidate for the worst albumsof the year.and this should be itThumbs way down for me.This is just terrible"
2,Skye Sweetnam is more punk than you!,"Avril says she's a punk pop singer, but all she does is shriek cuss into a microphone and how she gets a guitar to sound like a dying cat is beyond me. I hope God has forgivin her for what she's done. I like her song My Happy Ending though otherwise she would have gotten 1 star."
5,i like cheesecake,(rawk rawk rawk rawk rawk) its beta than her 1st album bcoz the songs arnt as poppy nd dont include sh.it like 'sk8er boi' best song is forgotten and my happy ending :D
1,if you listen to this,"you are LAME toys for her EXPERT writers who are eating your mind, pathetic losers, damn junkies, listen to some real music"
1,What a disgusting slob,"Avril Lavigne is so trashy, so sleazy. It looks like she doesn't bathe. She's so oily and greasy that she'd probably slide right through your hands if you tried to pick her up. Unbelievable filth completely covers every bit of her, and if she ever does decide to take a bath, she'll lose about 5 pounds! Why do you people like her? Why does everybody call her ""talented""? Since when does bathing only once a decade make you ""talented""? I think I know when the last time Avril bathed must have been. I bet it was 1993. There was a huge oil spill in that year. Everybody thinks the oil was spilled from a ship, but I wouldn't be suprised at all if it was just Avril Lavigne taking her once a decade bath!Avril Lavigne is the slipperiest, oiliest, greasiest dirtball I've ever seen. She's made it cool to be dirty. That's so disgusting."
1,F*ck you Oscar,"Who is that dude below me that thinks Avril is the hottest woman ever? Avril Lavigne is the trashiest, sleaziest pop singer ever. It looks like she hasn't bathed in ages. She looks like a prostitute who sells her body to pay for her heroin habit. What a trashy, sleazy, greasy dirtball. Yuck."
4,Double threat,"This CD/DVD ain't a total must. bvril fans or non-fans can buy it to get the DVD too... But owners of ""Under My Skin"" will find nothing in it except déjà-vu stuff.Nice DVD, awesome CD!"
3,Not superior to Let Go but on the same level,"This album doesn't really introduce a new side of Avril at least in the attitude of her songs, but definitely a more professional side, great vocals on this album compared to Let Go. But songs like Take Me Away and Slipped Away seem unfinished, and don't feel complete, but songs like Nobody's Home, My Happy Ending, and Don't Tell Me, do introduce at lighter and very fun side, Let Go was a little bit more fun to listen to, people who liked but didn't love Let Go, probably won't like this, but anyone who loved Let Go will appreciate the effort on this album."
4,"too poppy for a ""punk queen""","this CD is good...i definatly like her 1st CD better...it was more more lyricly inclined. The lyrics on this CD are good but its like shes run out of ideas...and the sound of her vocals and music is waay to poppy!Its still a good CD, not even close to hard core punk, but it could satisfy any pop, pop/punk, punk, alternative listener."
1,Nu-Metal?,"apparantly with the fading of the pop punk scene Avril had to slant her image and music towards the nu metal scene to stay popular. Her newfound angst (*insert laugh*) can be found throughout this extremely mediocre record. Although some songs are quite catchy, they quickly lose their kick and become boring rehashed songs with lacking melodies."
2,it's ok,She is a great singer and a i have a poster of her in my room. but i was not that happy with this album.It's ok don't hate it it's not the best
1,Boo.,"This sort of faux-punk teen crap should not be allowed retail in any civilized nation. This is music for whiny wannabe ""deep"" teens who are unpopular, write bad poetry, and have dreams of ""going to New York and showing everyone!"" Of course, we in the real world understand that wearing a tie does not a unique or even marginally interesting person make. And a marginally interesting person does not a decent pop artist make. If you truly strive for introspection, I suggest looking for it somewhere other than where MTV and Seventeen magazine suggest.Oh, as for the music itself? The worst type of shallow teen offal masquerading as profound or emotional work. It's a pretty weak disguise."
2,OMG,Oh. My. Gosh. Only three of the songs on this cd are even considerably good. I loved her first cd but this is just hatred and yelling. She has really gone to far.
5,"If you like Avril, you'll like this","Yes, I already had the CD. but this is worth it for the video extras alone. ""Nobody's Home"" is fantastic, with the young-Angelina Jolie(Foxfire) look-alike. my only complaint is that it should have been longer.If you are already an Avril fan, or if you are looking for an introduction to this wonderful, talented young woman's music, Get this disc!"
1,POSER,"avril lavigne is a huge poser and should not be allowed to make any cds or anything. why does she say that she hates britney spears when she goes on trl just like britney!!!! if you want some real punk music, listen to rancid, offspring, and bad religion."
5,If u haven't bought it....buy it now!!,"It's not because I'm an Avril lavigne fan, but this album has something really special that I can't explain. This girl is so talented, and all her 12 tracks on this album are special. All of them has something that makes you wanna listen to it over and over again. Sometimes I wonder that if i didn't buy this cd, i would have missed some greatest songs. In this album she has matured musically. You can see it through her lyrics, but it still has Avril lavigne flavor. I think it's a crime not to buy her cd. It's ambsolutely amazing, and if you're a big fan of songs that stick into your head...BUY IT NOW!!! Songs like 'nobody's home', 'happy ending' and 'slipped away ' are 6 out of 5 stars....Don't miss the opportunity to relate to some unforgetable songs!!!"
1,Evanavril,"(Much of review has been recycled from previous album, which seems to be acceptable artistic practice)Do you like collections of (even more) virtually identical, completely fabricated songs about poseurs and 'being yourself?' Well, then if you can wade through the terrible, grating lyrics, the shrill voice and a modicum of flawed melodies, you can treat yourself to this overplayed mass-media catering pap. With the impressive lyrical flair of constant 'na na na nas' and (many many more) 'yea-ee-aahs,' you'll never get tired of the mind-numbing repetition! It's also really cool to spell your song-names and lyrics with (outdated) internet speak. Recruit Chantal Krevaziuk, Raine Maida and Ben Moody, and you have the powers of several other mass-marketed generic flavours to through spins on Avril's all read tired product."
5,Avril Style..,"This album is different than the debu album but yet both are genius!Under my Skin is fabolous,more alternative hard rock tracksgreat lyrics,more fast tunes,but slow ones alsoAvril is singing strait from the heart specially on 'Slipped Away' & 'How Does It feel'you could hear a Crannberies influence but in an AVRIL way on 'Together'i tried to find a song that i can't listen to in her albumbut couldn't find a single one..this album is perfect&this album is Avril style:i mean by Avril Style music & lyricsjust like LET Go (coz it is Avril style too)so Avril Lavigne is still doin her own thing succesfullykeep on the good work gurl..U ROCK!"
1,All she ever does is complain,"What do people find so appealing about this music? Its loud, noisy, irratating and whiny. Every song sounds exactly the same--whispery vocals that explode into raging screams, ""chunk-a-chunk-chunk"" guitars, and whiney lyrics about how miserable life is. All she sings about are boys, how much she hates her life, and ""the pain inside"". Who wants to listen to that? Music is supposed to be entertaining. How can you be entertained by an entire album full of songs about ""the pain inside""? There's nothing entertaining about hearing someone whine about how hard their life is.And thats all she sings about. Every song is bitter, hateful, and completely miserable. How anybody could enjoy something this negative just makes no sense to me."
1,too young to be so mellodramatic,and the edgy act is extremely unconvincing.her one redeeming quality might be her pouting and the fact that these are the days of hormonally challenged teen boys.when will there be a music tv station aimed at those of us who know what real music is?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
1,This CD is for retards,"Only people who are challanged in knowing what music is talented and good like this. If you are a moron into the most stupid music, than this CD is for you! Every song sounds the same, and they are all about the same subject==how miserable Avril Lavigne thinks her life is. This clearly proves that Avril Lavigne has a low IQ and can't come up with any decent lyrics besides complaints. (OOOOOHH, how very very ""honest"" and ""mature""!) This is just pure and simple sh*t!!!"
1,OH GOD NOOO!!!,"More poser trash... when will this brat shut up? There's nothing here that wasn't done on her first album. I can't believe she had the nerve to say this was ""deep and emotional"". ""Don't try to tell me what to do""? She has NOT matured in the least. Do NOT support this little no talent!!!"
1,Screaming does not require talent!,"You Avril fans must be the stupidest people on Earth. You all think Avril is incredibly talented. WHY???Do you really think it takes talent to screech into a microphone? Because thats all Avril does. Get any other teenage girl to screech into a microphone, and it would sound pretty much the same. It requires talent to sing, but angry yelling can be done by anyone.You Avril fans need to stop being so narrow minded and bigoted. There's more to life than just anger rock."
1,"Her album ""Under My Skin"" sounds like pop with country???","She says the songs on the album are more rocking?? Yeah right!!!! ""ALL"" of her sounds sound the same. I just can't believe she spent 2 YEARS to record such a sucky record. Her first album was Great this one is nothing but the crap...its really bad. I recommend people to either download and burn her music ....or just start listening to katy rose . THIS ALBUM IS THE WORST!!!!!!!!!!! SOrry...AVril ...nice try!!!!!!!!"
5,whatever,"anyone who says avril has a bad voice they're soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo wrong!!! she can play piano and acoustic guitar, too!!!! and its NOTNOTNOT meant to be ""PUNK""!!!!!! Its pop/rock! THOSE people just havn't listened to her closly enough, hate girl singers or are obsessed with death metal!! I saw buy this CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Insipid,"I think having a rudimentary grasp of the English language is really detrimental to the enjoyment of this album. Perhaps to a Georgian goat herder from the Caucasus these new western pop sounds might be pleasing to the ear but the bland, lowest common-denominator melodies and insipid lyrics will leave the ear of the discerning listener rather bored and slightly irritated."
3,Hmm....,"You know, as much as I hated Avril Lavigne's first album and her totally faux punk-rock aura, I can't help but give her a better rating on this CD. I actually managed to enjoy ""My Happy Ending"". While she is not by any stretch of the imagination one of my favourite artists, I do find some enjoyment - however banal - in some of the tracks on Under My Skin. I do realize that this is marketed towards the 14 year old girl crowd (the children who wear those ridiculous neckties have awakened the murderous streak within me). However, if you're looking for an album that requires no thought processes whatsover (mindless semi-entertaining fluff), go ahead and add it to your shopping cart.P.S. ""Nobody's Home"" sounds horribly like a TaTu song. I could have sworn it was them the first time I heard it."
2,Under My Skin,"I'm not an Avril fan although I do enjoy some of her (previous) songs from Let Go. However, I have to say that 'Under My Skin' was a HUGE dissapointement.The only song on the album I actually play is 'Together' and still I try to avoid the ending of it(not a fan of her screaming, sorry). 'Take Me Away' has got quite good lyrics, I can partly relate too but again, the chorus ... not for me. 'He Wasn't' is probably one of the most annoying song ever.Plus crap lyrics. So all in all, not a good song.'How does it feel' has nice melody but again, I think the lyrics are a bit pointless. 'Don't Tell Me' was overplayed so much that I almost hate it same for 'My Happy Ending'.As I said before, I expected a really great, outstanding album but most of the songs either sound the same, have lyrics I'd not call 'good written' or some annoying screaming in it. In conclusion: Let Go was far better and clearly more various."
5,AWESOME!!!!!,"The first time I listented to this CD, I was a little worried. As I sat there listening, I fell in love with the album!!! It is one of my altime FAVES!!!! Buy this album and there is no doubt about it, you will love it!&quot;Take me away&quot; This song is one of my awesome!&quot;Together&quot; This one is pretty good.&quot;Don't tell me&quot; Don't tell me how good this song is!&quot;He wasn't&quot; not my fave&quot;How does it feel&quot; still, not my fave&quot;My happy Ending&quot; My first or second fave, a really catchy chorus!&quot;Nobody's Home&quot; Pretty good song!&quot;Forgotten&quot; It's ok...&quot;Who knows&quot; Again, it's ok...&quot;Fall to Pieces&quot; Fantastic Ending!&quot;Freak Out&quot; umm...?&quot;Slipped Away&quot; A sad song, (I LOVE IT!!!)"
3,back off,"So what if you think Avril or Good Charlotte are posers? people have different tastes, and that doesn't mean that you HAVE to diss on them. let people like what they like; how would you like someone constantly dissing your tastes in music? i respect everyone for who they are, no matter what they claim they are, whether they are what they say they are."
1,"Loud, noisy, and irratating----makes me want to go back in time and get away from this racket","Hearing an Avril Lavigne song makes me wish I could go back in time. Before Avril Lavigne conquered the world with her noisy guitar pop in 2002, music was MUSIC, not some NOISE! You could look at the top 40 charts and see artists who were actually musicians, not foul mouthed juvenile delinquents with bad attitude problems. They could actually sing, play instruments, write songs, and generally please the ear, as opposed to this day and age, where performers wear oversized clothes and spend more time breaking things and shouting obscenities than they do singing. I mean what an irratating, god awful racket this is! Avril Lavigne just screams aggressive lyrics over the blurring racket of noisy guitars. Its not even music at all really, its just loud...loud and irratating. How can kids actually ENJOY such an eardrum threatening noise level? It hurts my ears!"
1,How can I put this?,"Horrible! I don't know what's with this ""synthetic music"" but I fear that it may be carcinogenic. I might have to report this to the FDA.Avril's Image: Dark eye make-up and clothing (omg its a TIE), but with pop songs. I guess she's for all you TruE AlTEnaTivE PuNK RaWk kids out there. It pained me to type that.Avril's Music: Trite, repetitive and boring. Has she done anything Britney/Duff/your little sister hasn't? With talent?Ok, so I covered both aspects that a music fan (of today) might care about. That means that I have provided valid critcism of an invalid ""artist"", which means that you can't dismiss me saying I'm just a faux-depressed little mallgoth who is obsessed with slipknot and can't take another incompetent group being more popular than their's."
1,THIS IS POP MUSIC!,"Ok, avril fans, lets just get one thing straight. AVRIL'S MUSIC IS POP, NOT ROCK!!! Obviously y'all have never heard real rock music. I don't see how you could say it's rock???? REAL rock music has LOUD guitars, bass and drums. Where as Avril's music has been polished over way too much creating a crappy pop-rock sound.I'm not hating on you for liking her. You can listen to Avril, but don't go around saying she's a rocker.Just face it, this girl will NEVER ROCK!!"

4,Second Time Around...And Better Than Ever,"Avril Lavigne is back with her sophmore album titled as ""Under My Skin"". This strays away from her first debuted album ""Let Go"" from a poppish teeny rock girl to a young woman dealing with love,heartache and truth. From commercial songs as ""Don't Tell Me"" and ""My Happy Ending"", she overturns her poppish-punk side to more heartfelt realistic rock sounds to ""Forgotten"", ""Fall To Pieces"", and so many others. I can listen to this whole album without really skipping any tracks. Either way it is worth the buy."
1,To the MTV Supporter.,"Hey MTV Supporter, this is for you! Seriously, do you watch MTV from 6am to 8pm? Because I think your mind is filling with useless commercial c**p that in 5 years it would be forgotten. Seriously, Avril Lavigne, the best? Ni**a! She plays as good as those poser guitarist trying to act cool in their garage and she sings as well as those unqualified contestants on American Idol! Better than Jimmi Hendrix?! Boy, you sure are one stupid person let me tell you. At least Jimmi Hendrix makes REAL MUSIC while Avril Lavigne makes forgettable ""babosadas!"" Yeah, she may be #1 on MTV, but only on MTV.........HA! I think REALLY she may be like #52 on the BILLBOARDS..............the REAL MUSIC DEAL!!! Ha......................take that!Do yourself a favor and stay away from MTV for at least 10 years. It's really destroying your mind. Listen to REAL CLASSICS INSTEAD!!As to the rest of the people: ANYTHING THAT GETS PLAYED ON MTV IS 100% TOTAL GARBAGE!"
1,Avril who?,"She's an overblown wanna-be punk but sounds like Britney Spears nobody. She's overrated. She's the Shaq of music. She's just a marketing tool and this album sums it all up. The songs are not up to par and has she ever had singing lessons cause she needs em. She sounds like she's hurting herself. And what is wrong wtih her? She rich and seems happy so why does she dress and act like she's got a chip on her shoulder or pretend skateboarding is her thing. Avril fans need to take a look. This is not the real Avril and the only thing we know about her is that the lyrics in ""Complicated"" describe her perfectly."
2,"Avril, please take a class in creative writing","I recomend this album to any girl around the age of 13 who doesn't read much and won't mind the cliche and immature lyrics like, ""Walk around with my hands up in the air cause I just don't care,"" and ""I don't want to fall to pieces, I just want to sit and stare at you."" The very grown up,""Try to tell me what I shouldn't do, you should know by now I won't listen to you"" and my personal favorite, ""I looked away, then I looked back at you."" Clearly Avril is a talented story-teller.Other than the lyrics the music is a canned sort of pop that tried to sound like punk rock and failed."
2,A lot of improvment,"Considering I had a field-day ripping her first album, I feel obligated to point out the improvment Avril's made in her second effort.Clearly she's placing the right people around her and it's starting to show. She's still got a long way to go before she gains any TRUE credibility, but she's quickly making up a lot of ground."
3,Decent stuff,"People have to stop hating her enormous success. Sure her songs arent the most original or great for that matter. This album is what it is - decent. Think she sucks? Then go out there and prove you're better. But, give credit where it's due. Here's a teen who'll laugh herself to the bank. Chill out folks, she'll be forgotten tomorrow."
3,This girl needs to read some literature,"This album is clearly a step below ""Let Go."" Her voice has matured in two years, which is good, but her lyric writing is still juvenile; in short, she has the vocabulary of a 12 year old. If I knew her address I'd mail her some John Steinbeck or Jack London. Read some fiction, Avril!"
5,Amazing work of art!,"Under My Skin rocks the house!!!!! I absolutely love it!!!! It has been in my CD player since the day it was released. Each song has lots of edge and has a darker tone. Also, they are very catchy and I can't stop listening to them. It shows a more mature side of Avril, lyric wise and vocal. She is talented beyond her years and definitely proved herself as an artist with this album. It's truly her best work to date and I will always love her music and have much respect for her. I highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys Let Go. You will not be disappointed. Avril is the best!!!!!!! Rock on! :)"
1,Lame,This CD is very boring. Its a good CD if you want to fall a sleep.These songs are dull and lack character.
5,Huge Improvement,"I wasn't the biggest fan of her debut album, only a few songs that I liked, but this album is much different, and I like every single song on it. If you were a fan of Avril from her debut, definitely pick up this album, you'll be more than happy! If you're not a fan of Avril, give this album a chance, it's different, and more mature. Also anyone who is just looking for a great female rock album, don't look no further!"
1,Total Garbage,"Avril is completely and totally fake. She's a no talent ass-clown, and it doesn't surprise me one bit that she sells a lot of records since she's being marketed to today's youth. She calls herself punk. Hahahahaha. What a joke. Punk? Has she heard herself? The Ramones are punk. The Buzzcocks? Punk. The Clash? Yep, you guessed it -- punk. Avril is a little brat who thinks the world owes her something. Well honey, no one owes you a damn thing, and if someone did somehow, in some way, owe you something, I think it would be more along the lines of telling you the truth about how much you frickin suck!And on a side note, why do people write reviews using letters and numbers instead of whole words? It makes you look very ignorant."
1,Yooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Yo thugs, how r ya!!!!. Now, I know many of ya don't know me. I'm da Gangsta with good Taste Charge, yo. I have phat taste, and I know what's good, and what's a $hit. This ma playaz, is crap. Da Queen of Posers. U better get rid of this crap, cuz is crap. If u have good taste, you ain't got this. U have some good metal or some good Classical Muzak CDThis is for da posers that ""discover"" Muzak watching TRL. Avoid this, Peace out Avril luvas and hatazG-W-G-T-I-CH"
3,Not much variety,"Avril Lavigne is back with her brand new album...and it sounds the same as her first. The only difference between this album and her first is that there is slightly more guitar work in her songs, some songs appear to be talkng about something a little deeper than boyfriends, and Avril makes an attempt to sing different notes. No points for key change, though.Other than that, its the same old, same old. We can only hope that she'll get better with age."
5,best rock cd of all time,"nov 03 2004the don,t tell me 10/10 best song of all time.MY HAPPEY ENDING HAPPY AND SAD ENDING AND IT 10/10AVRIL COME TO OTTAWA TO PLAY THANK YOUPAUL HAMILTON"
4,most songs are worthy of praise,"All in all, I did like this CD, though I felt that her first attempt was somewhat better, with catchier beats, and more upbeat songs. Some songs seemed to sound the same and were kinda deppressing, but more often then not I ended up liking them. Here is my list of what songs you really should give a chance:1.Fall To PiecesSo good, great melody and touching lyrics.2.Nobody's HomeGood, but I HATE the chorus, it sounds so much like that Evenescence song that I can't stand.3.Freak OutCute song, HATE the techno begning, I agree with other reviews that it seems a little immature to be on this ""deep"" Cd . Still it is very catchy and fun to listen to.4.Don't Tell MeOkay, this song does get a little annoying after hearing it a MILLION times, still I like it for it's awesome message.5. Who KnowsVery good, upbeat song. I don't like the chorus much though.Give this CD a chance, if you hate it give it too some teenage girl you know going through a diffucult break-up!"
3,not a fan but impressed with one song,"my little cousin bought the cd and played it for me in the car and im not a Avril fan or the poppy teen music. but one song really impressed me .""together"" what a hot song!!!. superb vocal performance.i didnt know she was capable of those notes.what a cool song.her new cd has a more mature feel(although some songs are still teen angst-like for my taste,im 27) and those who have a open mind this one should appeal to a wider audience."
1,crap,"this is possibly the worst album ive ever heard next 2 Elvis. i mean c'mon, if ur going 2 release something, at least make sure that they can sing. William Hung can sing better. Basically, this album sucks."
1,Piece of sh*t,"This album was recommended to my by my older sister who said I needed to ""brighten my horizons"" due to my obsession with Viking and Thrash Metal. For this, I'm disowning her.Worst piece of crap album I have ever heard. The Worst.I don't even need to explain."
1,Avril,"Okay there are good reviews and then there are bad reviews..I'm going to give you a bad review with Ms. Avril here. First off the girl is a bit annoying if you will. She is rude to her fans, she calls herself things that arn't true, and have you ever seen this girl on a skateboard other then in her videos? She needs to change her attitude or prove some things, and not just flip off the camera and wear a tutu with combat boots. She is the reason we have one of the worst word in the history of time today: ""The poser"". She practly made that a house hold saying...and it's not something a real ""punk"" would say. Now on to her music. She's a bit...let's say whiney. She's way to pop punk for her own good. Anyway...I guess I don't know alot about her music other then I dislike it. But to all the Avril fans out there...more power to you..I prolly wouldn't beable to stand an idol that was rude to me for dressing like her and acually liking her. So demand some respect from her Avrilfans! Do something!"
1,CRAP,"I would like to apologize to all of the people who saw a good review of this cd, went out and wasted 15 bucks on it, and then realized that it was the worst album EVER. In 2002, Avril released ""Let Go"". I thought nothing could be as horrible musically until I heard ""Under My Skin"". Avril hardly writes any of her music, then she sings it horribly with abysmal guitars, bass, and drums. She is a poser. She bashes Hilary Duff and Britney for being to artificial, then to show it she goes on trl and says shes punk. The first thing I thought when I saw a commercial for it was ""wasn't Britney on a few days ago?"" She is not hardcore by any means and is a disgrace to any musician or music listener. Also, I believe that people that are truly punk rockers HATE CORPORATIONS. Avril is a postergirl for everything artificial and bad. This is not real music."
1,A hilariously awful approximation of rock music,"Avril Lavigne does not write songs. She writes lyrics. Other people write the music. Avril Lavigne whines constantly that she is not given recognition for her abilities on guitar, yet does not play guitar even once on this record. All Avril Lavigne has to do is show up at the studio with terrible, monosybillic poetry of the junior-high variety, and she goes triple-platinum. With all of this in mind, it's hard to figure out what has to be angry about. Nearly every song here is a faux-grunge dirge, polished and compressed, ready-made for the shopping mall. Avril Lavigne was kind of cute and funny when she released her first album; her tremendous attitude and lack of any musical talent, though, have rendered her irrelevant."
3,3.5 stars,"Excellent Tracks:T2,T6,T7,T10Very Good Tracks:T14Good Tracks:~~~Meh Tracks:T4,T5,T3,T2,T9,T8Bad Tracks:T11Horrible Tracks:T13,T12Current Single:My Happy EndingUpcoming Single:Nobody's Home"
1,Boring album,"Thiis album is very borng. The album will make you fall a sleep, better yet it was make the baby fall a sleep too."
3,The sophomore slump,"The album is a bit of a disappointment, lacking a lot of the fun pop spirit that made Let Go so surprisingly enjoyable. Great songs like Sk8er Boi and Complicated are not duplicated here.On the plus side, the album is much more consistent than Let Go, losing the novelty tracks like the spoken word/'Cheerios in my spoon' songs that haunt the back half of Let Go.The first single, ""Don't Tell Me,"" is nice. It's not a oh-my-goodness-I-need-to-buy-the-single kind of song, but it is a good illustration of what the rest of the album is like. ""He Wasn't"" has some entertaining moments, but has a pieced together feel. The rest of the songs seem to blend into a sleepy sameness, with overall a more adult-contemporary sound.Take the median track from Let Go, multiple by 12, and you have Under My Skin."
2,RIP OFF!,"Supposedly, this contains the album in 'enhanced' stereo. Well guess what? It's 16bit/48khz. Cds are 16bit/44.1khz. It sounds EXACTLY the same as the cd layer, and I'm willing to bet that it is from the exact same cd master. There is NO surround mix either. Pathetic."
1,Avril is sooo OVER!!!!,OH Mah god!! Like have you listened to like Avrils new CD!!! Like is this like music!?! Like I have to like give her like props for like coming out of like her house dressed like that but I mean actually singing like those songs!!!EWWW!!! Like I mean what is like up with like the greassy hair! Like the Alanis Morsette style is like SOOO........OVER!!! OK last year when we like first listened to her songs we were like WHOA but now we are all like UGH cuz like her songs are like DEPRESSING!! HEllo?!?! Like Reality Check?!?! Being like a girl rocks! Like I dont know why she's like screaming about like being like a girl?? She like puts in a bad name for likeus other girls !!!Like BIG time!!!
1,ok...,"Har! Lets flame everyone who doesn't agree with us! The fact is, you guys who think this 19 year old ""genius"" *cough* is good are complete morons. The fact is, don't mistake lack of talent for genius. I don't even have to listen to this album. I know it sucks. The single was on the radio on the way to school (unfortunantly) and I already know every song on here will be horrible. I agree with antiradio. Listen to some Dream Theater, or Opeth, or Slayer for bands that are much, much more talented than Avril laughasosgah... and don't bash The cure just because MTV doesn't tell you to like them and you can't appreciate them. But anyway, after my little tangent there, my point is she sucks, and always will suck, and should give up and stop giving everyone headaches."
1,Crap,Avril singing a bunch more crappy pop songs...whiny songs about hating her ex-boyfriends. The songs are nowhere near as catchy as the ones on Let Go though. Avril has done no growing or maturing as an artist.
1,Horrible album!,Just a bunch of crappy pop songs that sound vaguely familiar....as in ripped off from somewhere else.
1,no stars,"wow this girl is such a poser and all she does is sing about how much she hates posers, she should go kill herself."
4,who the hell said she's punk?,"do you children even KNOW what punk music is? If avril had released this album in the 90's she would have been called alternative music just like alanis morisette, green day, no doubt, oasis and countless others were called, because THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT SHE IS! An alternative music artist! If you totally forget the term punk even exists while listening to this CD(cause she has nothing to do with punk) I'm sure you'll appreciate it for the good music avril has on this CD. It's much more mature than her first album with deep lyrics, good songwriting and great guitar riffs. It's not music for teenagers, she's obviously appealing to adult contemporary radio too. You can tell avril has let herself be influenced by other musical artists while recording this CD and it shows. Good job avril."
1,"It's like getting herpes, only less fun.","This music should be used to torture detainees in Iraq. Mere seconds of this ridiculously abysmal album could send any normal person into waves of hysterics. And her ""style"", if you could call it that, is reminiscent of what a goth would wear if they had Downs syndrome.Now, onto the music:It's horriffic. Someone I know tried to make me listen to this album. I took it out of their CD player, broke it in half and shoved the shards up their ass. That's the last time they try to make me listen to pop music. Her voice is abrasive, at best, and the quality of playing on the instruments is pretty lame. I know high school bands that play 3 chords better than her.It makes me wonder what went wrong in America, when this passes for ""good"", or ""talented"". I also start to wonder if the people who work at record companies are tone deaf, or can't spot talent.I think I'm going to try and rid my bowels of the diahrrea that this album caused."
1,Somebody pass Avril some deodorant!,"Avril Lavigne is just VILE. I've never seen anyone this disgusting in my life. I don't think I've ever seen a picture of her where she looks clean and neat. Every time I've ever seen her it looks like she hasn't bathed in years! Everything about her is greasy. Her hair, her skin, everything. In that video for Complicated, she lifts her arms making sure the camera gets a good shot of her greasy armpits! I think I'm going to be sick! I can't reccommend this CD to anybody who bathes more than once a month!"
1,Not who you think...,"Avril is not the type of person you think she is. She cant play guitar,she just strums on any chord she can, she even said so in a magizine. She cant sing either, She claims to be punk but look at her. Shes not even close, Punk died along time ago. If you want real punk music, then listen to bands like..Sex Pistols,Ramones,Clash,Dead Kennedys,Operation Ivy,Bad Religon,New York Dolls, I dont see the newer punk bands screaming out there lungs or writing lyrics that make no sense. I dont see the newer punks doing crazy things and punks were never on MTV...What are you little kids thinking these days? I am not telling you to not listen to her or anything but shes not what people think"
1,Who actually likes this crap?,"Avril shows people how to kill music in three steps.1. Claim to be punk, even though emo kids are more punk than you2. Write music that claims to be punk, but is pure pop3. Sell your soul by being played on MTVSo there, that shows how Avril Lavigne killed music. If anyone comes up to me and says she is punk, I'd call them an MTV poser."
4,Wow...,"Well, actually 3 and a half stars, but you can't do that, so I'll round it up. Avril has matured a lot since the last one, and the songs have harsher lyrics and are rock more than pop. I like it, personally. High points: the hit My Happy Ending, Take Me Away, and Don't Tell Me. They're catchy and you can relate to them. Low points: He Wasn't and How Does It Feel. They have crappy lyrics and How Does It Feel barely even has a tune."
2,I don't get it...,"I don't quite get what is so good about Avril Lavigne. Cause she's certainly not anywhere near good rock music. And as for female rock musicians she stalls far behind the likes of Sheryl Crow. So is she just better than the average pop musician? And what's with her ""punk"" image. She's not punk at all, but it seems to be so wrapped up in her music that it taints it. Her music just isn't very good...so why does it pass?"
4,WOW!,"Ok. To be honest I thought this CD would suck! But it kicks ass! I've been a fan on and off since Avril's debut song, Complicated...and after awhile I quit liking her cuz I thought she was a poser and immature. Well compared to her 1st album, this album is SO much better. It has good songs, great beats, and is much more mature. My favorite songs off this album are:Nobody's Home 4/5He Wasn't 4/5My Happy Ending 5/5 (my fave song!)Take Me Away is pretty good but my radio station has WAY overplayed it."
5,Avrils' C.D. Rocks,"I have not yet purchased this cd myself, but have heard all the songs and love them. I think this cd is going to be number one in the charts. So far my favorite song is Dont Tell Me. Its like in each of the songs she tells a little bit about herself. And its really cool. Its like listening to the whole cd you start to learn a little something new about her. I love Avril Lavigne and she deserves to be number 1!!!!"
5,Avril,"It is hard to put in words how amazing this new cd is. Avril Lavigne has advanced so much in the past few years in the music industry. Not only growing in her music, but growing as a person also. You get a real picture of who she is through this cd."
1,sk8er boi was a fun song but the onley one of its kind from,The worst cd ever. Boring!!! Definetly download this one its the same cd as the first one. Shes obviously a [...] if u listen 2her lyrex. Bottom line sk8er boi was a fun song but the onley one of its kind from her. She [...]. The only reason she go 1 star from me is caus thats as low as it can go.
1,Why? Why? Why?,"Why do all the fakes get all the attention? Why not the women who really can rock? Is the media too afraid of them? Instead we get Avril Lavigne who's so supposedly the 'antidote' to Britney Spears? Don't you people get it? Avril is NOT the antidote to Britney. She is only the GERM that spreads the disease. This is total pop music. Some may call it pop/rock but the more pop than rock. It's just sad. If you want some punk rock made by women you should try Babes In Toyland, Bikini Kill, L7, early Hole, Bratmobile, Huggy Bear, etc. These bands were around when Avril was still in elementary school! Ha! How sad that all these bands have been forgotten."
1,"Wow, I didn't know Alanis Morissette had a daughter?!","If you bought her first cd, at least you know not to buy this one."
4,"""Who knows what could happen...""","Avril Lavigne's sophomore effort, Under My Skin doesn't live up to her debut album, Let Go but this disc isn't terrible either. Her songwriting is disappointing here, her voice is stunning, and the way the songs are arranged is fabulous but I like an artitst that has strong and insightful lyrics and unfortanely, Under My Skin fails to deliver poetic-like lyrics. Standout tracks include: How Does it Feel, Don't Tell Me, He Wasn't, Freak Out, Slipped Away, Fall to Pieces, Who Knows, My Happy Ending, and Nobody's Home. As you can see I like most of the songs but there is no orginialty but I have to admit her songs are so damn catchy and sometimes just that alone is good enough. I prefer Let Go, hope her next album grabs my attention."
4,Avril Lavigne cd,"this cd was in excellent condition when I received it. the cd only had two small smudges on it, but they easily came off."
3,New Comeback,"I was looking forward to hearing Avril's new album, and I admit I was a LITTLE disappointed. It sounds like she is just ""yell singing"" (if you know wat I mean) on many of the songs. The lyrics are AWESOME though. They have a lot of meaning. Nobody's Home, Fall to Pieces, Who Knows and Together are my favs. Overall, a pretty good album. I heard that in an interview she had when her first album came out she said she wouldn't wear skirts for photo shoots. On the cover of Under My Skin, she is wearing a frilly skirt! Maybe trying to go for a more britney look, slowly."
3,Hmm,"In interviews, Ms. Lavigne appears to have no brain. However, she has a knack for catchy songs and melodies. Her lyrics aren't exactly brilliant, but who cares? This album is entertaining and that's all Avril is good for."
1,"Marketing, pure and simple","All hype, and nothing else, Avril Lavigne represents a complete triumph of marketing over substance. The fact that these bratty, suburban, juvenile delinquent tunes could sell 6,000,000 copies just shows what promotion will do. If you want to be Lemming #6,000,001, go ahead and get this, but if you want music with any kind of depth or integrity, you need to move on."
1,oh come on....,"well... what do i have to say... after listening to her songs, i must say that sweet little avril went pop star these days....from cool looking, great sounding punk star, she went to class c off beat pop tunes, looking like she just came from christina aguilera's hairstylist and wardrobe...she went from cool, colorful punkie clothes to girly pink and gothic black outfits wich make her look like an overgrown rat...sorry for sounding so harsh on her but strike one, strike two, strike three, you're out Avril!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!pop is on it's way out, and so are you"
1,Did you think that I was gonna give up $13.49 to you?,"Avril Lavigne shows the true extent of her talent as a song writer and musician. She's clearly someone to watch, in the same way as an airplane crash, or a bloody car wreck, or a coyote mauling a kitten. Sadly the extent reaches out beyond its grasp. It grabs for the beer cozy next to it and falls down and shatters its hip. But if you already like Avril you'll probably like this album anyway, so there's no point. Buy a Radiohead album or Disintegration by the Cure if you have an inkling towards good music."
1,I can hear again...,"And.. 1...2...3! 3 chords! WOW! You know you kick ass when you can play 3 chords!*PSYCHE*This is useless trendy mainstream ""I'm dark and depressed and ever-so-punk so buy my CD"" crap. It makes me sad. Is this what we have come to in music? Is this it?*sighs*Oh well. I suppose I always have Pantera. That always makes me feel better. And it'll stop any compulsive ear bleeding after hearing this.Anyway, let's take a poll:If you think Avril Lavigne is a talentless hack, click helpful, if not...PS: I am over 13. In fact I am 23."
1,talentless loser,"avril is a talentless loser. seriously, if any more of these lame fans of her tell me how much this loser rocks i am going to go insane! i am sick and tired of people calling avril a ""punk rocker"" or even a musician for that matter. she cannot even hold a guitar right not to mention play it! she is manufactured pop icon with watered down lyrics any preschool student could surpass."
1,under my dead body!,"well...Avril is a nice girl,very pretty, very neat...but she has to decide herself about what kind of girl she wants to be, because that kind of nice girl,skating dude,punk rocker,romantic lady, bad (...)stuff is driving many people crazy! Avril sweety...grow up."
1,fake,Avril lavigne is nothing more than a fake punk rocker that the record label created to attract those posers who think there so punk. She has no talent she can barley even play a guitar .And her voice is alterd to the point of no return . I recomend a good band like metallica or nirvana.
1,She is NOT punk!,"Anyone who claims she is ""punk"" has no idea what they are talking about. Darby Crash & the Germs would kick this little poseur's behind into the middle of next week...and then go out for a beer.She wants to be the female Sid Vicious, but comes across more like Sid Caesar!"
1,Good for 8 year olds.,"Oh wait hang on hang on... i thought that to be seen as a talented artist worthy of such publicuty you had to a) write you own lyrics, b)write you own music and, c) actualy be able to hold a note. Lyrics like ""did ya think i was gonna give it up to you."", what oh you mean your virginity? well why the hell would i want some chick with the body of a 10 year old. Get over yourself girl. Plus lay off the drugs everytime your on tv your like completely spaced out. Whats with all the swearing? You dont swear on any of your cds. Is it cus it upsets your mommy. Posers like this make me sick. Buy this cd for your 10 year old daughter. Anyone who enjoys this music over that age must be mentally retarded."
1,take her away!!!!,"i heard ""take me away""-wow such a terrible song i never heard in yearsher vocals just getting worse from each songbut im sure tons of people are going to buy this crap,why?i have no cluep.s. isnt she published ""dont tell me"" few years ago in another name? what was it? oh yehh,""complicated"""
1,HILARY DUFF HAS BETTER SCORES THAN YOU!!!!,I looked at the morjerity stars on your itean (Under my Skin) Avril and they're only 4. But on Hilary Duff she has 4 1/2 and that's bgger. Not by much but obviously more people like her better than you. Buy Hilary Duff's new CD 'Fly not this. And I do believe that Hilary Duff is better than you...DON'T BUY THIS!
2,Why Should I Care?,cuz you werent there when I was scared.I was so alone.WHY SHOULD I CARECUZ YOU WERENT THERE WHEN I WUB U!
1,Trash,"This CD is garbage. I am sick and tired of Avril Lavigne and her poor attitude. This girl is more manufacted then Briteny Spears.I songwriting team called the Matrix wrote the majority of Avril last album and made her who she is today. Without htem she is a nothing.It is funny how that same production crew callled the Matrix, went on to work with two artist that Avril hates the most, Britney Spears and Hilary Duff."

3,Not that impressive for a second album,"Britney's dark rival Avril Lavigne was a ""Complicated"" girl when she hit charts with her best-selling punk/rock record Let Go. Her new CD Under My Skin isn't nearly as a satisfying listen as most second albums seem to be (just look at Britney's Oops!...I Did It Again, which outdid its record-breaking debut). I enjoy ""Take Me Away,"" ""Together,"" ""Don't Tell Me"" and ""My Happy Ending."" I don't understand why people are so impressed with Lavigne's songwriting skills either; they're not that poetic like Jewel's songs, just like something a girl would write in her diary it seems. Close, Avril, but no cigar. Let Go is still your best release! (Note: I like Avril Lavigne's first CD a lot, I'm not just saying I don't like her second because she's Avril and likes to diss my favorite living entertainer Britney Spears.)"
1,A disappointment,"After an amazing first album, I couldn't wait to buy her second album. I was thoroughly disappointed. It is horrible. In my opinion, it has 3 good songs, top. However, that is based on her material from her first album. Perhaps, for a first time listener, this would be a good album. My recommendation...don't buy this album."
1,"If only there was a ""zero"" rating","Absolutely horrible!My friend got this cd and you might as well sell it in a garage sale. Waste of 12 bucks, that's for sure.Save your money for something worth listening to"
1,Avril is Amasing,"This new cd is the goods. I mean everyone keeps calling her a pile of loaf, but she is really good. I saw her on SNL and the Today show and she can really play the guitar!! Her fingers were pushing down on the wire thingies on the guitar and moving around. I think she is as good as any rocker on guitar, just give her a chance. Her singing is NOT out of tune live, she sings that way on purpose to sound different. It is only out of tune if it is not done purposely. I can't wait till her next CD, it is supposed to be all goth and black sabbath kinda stuff."
1,still a Alanis Moresette clone&Predictable,nothing here shows me much Artistic Growth at all.Avril Lavigne is following a Set Formula at appearing a certain way Musically but She doesn't have the Depth as a Musician to pull it off.She reminds me of Alanis&liike Alanis a Image was crafted to sell her a certain way but after a few albums that formula played it's ownself out.the same thing is happening here again.
3,Disappointed,"My expectations were very high for this album, but it is clearly a step below her first. There is only one potential hit on this CD (""My Happy Ending""). The production is good, but the catchy tunes she is known for are missing. The juvenile lyrics, while excusable on her first album, are still present here, and the profanity is unprofessional."
2,noo,"I listened to this CD with an open mind and trying to ignore her obviously fake punk pose. But it wasn't like it had cute poppy songs like her first album, in fact, I found it monotonous, lacking of substance, and perhaps giving more importance to the photographs inside the booklet where Avril tries to come off like, yet again, a real (?) punk.Temptingly, it's called Under My Skin, like you really wanna go there (?) like it really takes you anywhere...? All the songs sounded the same to me, and it makes me think that she is no better than all the other crappy posers of today. This isn't rock, this isn't punk, it's some sort of strange dull teenybop.I didn't hate it, but I think it doesn't have any substance and it doesn't deserve the hype. A so-so album."
1,???,"You want a genuine teen angst album...listen to Twisted Sister's Under the Blade, You Can't Stop Rock n Roll, or Stay Hungry albums. Thats rock n roll and most people seem to have forgotten what that is, and believe me...Avril Lavigne is definatly not Rock n Roll. Dee Snider would eat her dead..."
2,Ho-hum,"Avril's sophomore album does little to boost her cred. The first album was ok, this album is a little bit below ok. More songs dwell on adult topics (as compared to Let Go songs). However, this I can say is not real punk rock. Nor any kind of rock music. It is plain, commercialized ""punk rock"". Radio-friendly songs but I am annoyed when singers (not artists) use the punk/grunge/rock/hiphop image wherein they are not actually immersed in that certain culture."
3,"Good album, but less fun then Let Go","Avril brings her singing skills to this album, but shows a more boring album here, Let Go was fun to listen to because of songs like Complicated and Sk8er Boi, but this album has Nobody's Home and My Happy Ending, which are good, don't get me wrong, but are not even close to as fun to listen to, this is good to add to your shopping list for hardcore Avril fans but for people who just liked but didn't love the album shouldn't buy this one, but overall a good effort for a sophomore album."
2,what happened 2 da real avril???,"i dont know what happened 2 avril but i hate it. this CD is all gothic and moody and shes tryin 2 sing hi notes 2 much. she totally lost her style and now she looks and sings like a prostitute. also, she isnt articulate at all. she just kinda moans and groans about her ""pain"" too much. she also throws random swears into her songs 4 no reason. she could choose other words 2 use in their place, but i think she wants to sound cool or somethin'. shes only got 2 semi-good songs on the whole CD, My Happy Ending & Nobody's Home. (she also had no sense of style for the CD photos. she has this really tacky poofy skirt for most of da pics, & they're not even halfway down 2 her knees. she wears black makeup, 2.)"
1,stupid so called punks,"i think that people who call themselves punks and then deny it is not cool because that makes people wounder when you are telling them the truith or not and so you would not really be trusted. as far as her music goes, most of her songs are crap. they are not even how should i put this... they dont sound good at all and if you see her live and she is not liping to background lyrics then you would obviousely not like her and not want to go to anymore avril concerts and not buy anymore of her cds. trust me. her music is for little kids because once you reach highschool you finally reolize that she is a fake and makes crappy music."
1,A must to avoid!,"Avril Lavigne is quite simply one of the worst new artist to come out in recent years. This is in no way an improvement on her debut. She has labeled this as being ""Deeper and more emotional"", yet the lyrics here are not the least bit more mature than those of her debut (although nothing here is NEARLY as cringe-inducing as ""Sk8r Boi"") People, if you didn't like ""Let Go"", don't buy this expecting to be pleasantly surprised. You'll be miserably disapointed!"
1,The Music Factory,"""She could be no more obviously manufactured if she had a barcode and a telephone number for customer services taped to her forehead."" - The GuardianI couldn't put it better myself."
1,she doesn't have much musical talent..,"I don't think Avril Lavigne has much talent. Her voice sounds alike in all the songs, and they all just mix together. After awhile all the songs are old and sound the same so I just can't stand this CD anymore. The only song on this CD I can stand is ""happy ending"" because I like the lyrics. Even though I like this song, I think it should have been song by someone else. I think it would have sound a whole lot better."
2,i actually haven't heard the whole cd but....,"I needed to write this because I was sickened by all the reviews on the board. At least if you are going to write something make it intelligent and don't say something like ""listen to good charlotte, new found glory, and simple plan instead"" because none of those bands are good either. In fact they suck. If you really want to hear good music listen to Ben Kweller, or Cursive, or Sunny Day real estate, death cab for cutie, travis, modest mouse, guster, or the shins. Don't pollute yourself with stuff from the radio thats completely mainstream. Educate yourself about music. Do your research. And maybe Avril isn't very good but don't fool yourself into thinking that Good charlotte is better because it makes you seem ignorant."
1,sad,What does she have to be so sad about? She is a multi millionare and shes crying and whinning over nothing. Get over yourself.
2,"They Should Call Avril ""Average""","She's not The Best But i Must Admit she's Better Then Some. She's got her own style and her own way of singing that I reapeat IS NOT PUNK! (Sorry but she's not.) This CD includes three of her best songs and popular singles, ""Happy Ending,"" ""Slipped Away"" and ""Don't Tell Me."" Although in my opinion her first album was much better and easier to listen to."
1,What a fake poser $#$%^&**!!!!,"Avril absolutely SUCKS. The only way she could be any more poser is to come out with a gangsta rap CD next. You guys know that she was originally signed to be the next big COUNTRY thaaang, right? About 1 WHOLE YEAR before her first POS CD was released. In fact, she got ""discovered"" because she won a contest to get to sing with Shania Twain. How Sk8r of her!Oh, and one other thing, I did really like her voice the first time I heard it...I think it belonged to Alanis Morrisette (yet another poser, but at least she has some talent and isn't totally ""put together"" like a friggin Frankenstein monster by the record labels.BURN THIS FAKE #$*&$% POSER'S CD'S, IMMEDIATELY!!!! DO IT NOW!!"
1,Shes gotten under my skin and its painful.,"why do u people by stuff like this?! its totally trash! good for nothing! why do u wnat to listen to some idiot complain about some boyfriend on a cd? and swear too? if you want to listen to good music try jessica simpson's ''sweet kisses'', stacie orrico's ''genuine'', zoegirl's ''life'', and any of racheal lampa's cd's."
4,Some nice songs but Let go was better,1. Take me away 7/102. Dont tell me 9/103. Nobodys home 9/104. Who knows 9/105. Slipped Away 8/10
3,oh she's not that bad,"Avril Lavigne has a great mouth and sexy vampire teeth. And that's good enough. This girl is a doll. Oh yeah the music, ah who cares it's alright."
1,I Enjoi Toy Machine Flipping Me Off Like A Shorty,"Hear us Edgar Allan Houston Troves. This Lavine is from Phillipeine. I hear she date man pacquiao. He had own video game called Pacman. Just kidding or no? H8ighlight. These songs are atrocuiz. They are bad. You are young, no nothign much about music like enlightened felo say. She misporned David Bowie. No disrespect a in a woprld disrespect. But wait. Now thids girl is corporate oligarchy poster child. Beleeve me, Wutangg is clan bnot to fcuck with. I can;t w8 for reel patriot to cum from Montana and put an end to this fast food society. Fckuck lavine. fcuck Mtv. You young, so peace is the highlight. Yes or no?"
3,WTF,I have not listened to this cd nore will i ever. I already know what it is going to be and that i will only be able to listen to 1/3 of the cd with out gagging. I am here to b*tch about everyone thinks that Avril Lavigne (or good Charlote for that matter)is punk. Punk is actual music and is written by the band members. Not writing your music or sticking to a punk format( very few chords) is considered selling out which is what Avril did. She is there only for the money. NOT PUNK! This may be good pop its f*cking horrible punk.
1,Avril---A great talent and beautiful too!,"Avril Lavigne is a wonderfully sophisticated, erudite lady of the old school whose continental charms and gentle, poignent lyrics (especially those about kicking her boyfriend(...)) add so much musically, culturally, and morally to our civilization. Furthermore, she is also incredibly beautiful, sort of in a supermodel-like way don't you think? What a romantic, so subtle and witty! She's classically beautiful! Move over Cindy Crawford, get lost Christy Turlington, forget it Caroline Murphy! Here's a REAL babe of a woman----Avril! A real charmer! Hey, has she kicked anyone (...) this week?"
2,Holy Crap This Sucked,"Simply put this CD made me want to puke, it reminded me of all those hippies sitting around a campfire and singing songs about love. Maybe record companies should look into actually producing good music instead of crying about how music sales have fallen."
2,It's Just Kinda Bad,"I really liked Avril when she first came out, but I'm really not impressed with this one. I feel like she's trying too hard as opposed to being authentic, which I felt more with the first album. There's nothing that really moves me or stays with me like ""Complicated"" or ""I'm With You"" I dunno, maybe it'll grow on me. Try Alanis' So-Called Chaos instead. That's really good pop-rock."
2,...,"buy this album if you like watching grass grow or if you are a mindless thirteen year old. Like many have stated before, the lyric really suck. I know that some of you like shallow songs about breakups and crappily written songs that try way to hard to have meaning, but you're probably a thirteen year old :) There is, however, one remotely good track, ""My happy ending"" which I initially liked because it had a nice melody and I could ignore the silly lyrics, but now it just gets annoying. so this album gets two stars, because it entertains its target audience (thirteen year olds and people who like watching grass grow ie boring people) quite nicely."
1,Not at all very good!,I expected this to be more like her first album. This has fallen flat in my opinion and hope her third cd is better.
5,AVRIL LAVIGNE....SIMPLY DA BEST!!!,"THIS CD IS DA BEST!!! SERIOUSLY,IT'S NOT THAT I WANNA SAY ALL POSITIVE THINGS JUST TO HELP AVRIL BUT IM SERIOUS,IT'S REALLY GOOD! THE MUSIC IS GREAT AND THE LYRICS...IT'S LIKE SHE READ MY MIND AND WROTE ON PAPER! THERE IS A CHANGE AND I KNOW SUM OF U MUST THINK:""I LIKED THE OLD AVRIL AND I DONT WANT ANY CHANGE"" BUT TRUST ME,YOULL LUV THE CHANGE! THIS IS A MUST HAVE CD AND THE INSIDE BOOKLET IS AWESOME! THE PICTURES R GREAT AND WE ALL LUV AVRIL BCUZ IT'S HER!! BYE THE CD NOW!!!! THE BST SONGS R ""WHO KNOWS"",MY HAPPY ENDIND,DONT TELL ME,HE WASNT,HOW DOES IT FEEL,TOGETHER,AND ACTUALLY ALL OF THEM!!! BYE IT NOW"
2,unconvincing,"This album is well produced. The guitars rock. The drums bang. Avril's voice sounds great. What's not to like, right?Avril is supposed to be the edgy alternative to today's pop music. And she is. However, her lyrics lack creativity. I bored quickly of the predictable rhymes of an eighth grade poet. Listen to ""He Wasn't"" and ""Fall to pieces"" and tell me you don't know every line that is coming.She needs to take some lessons from Fiona Apple, Veruca Salt, and Alanis. All sang with real emotion and they all know what a metaphor is. Avril's singing lacks both the complexity and the sincerity that could make her music great.But, maybe I am forgetting what her demographic is.Avril will succeed in part because there are not many competitors in the teen angst department of pop music these days. But if you want to hear some young women rock with emotion see if you can dig up Fair Verona's album."
2,Nice album but bad DualDisc,"The huge hype around DualDiscs is the option for multichannel (""surround"") mixes of albums to be presented on the DVD side. Think of it - a multichannel mix of an entire album that can be played on anyone's DVD player, assuming you've got your DVD player hooked up to a nice surround sound system.And yet, strangely, this DualDisc of Avril's second album is not available in multichannel, but rather is only in stereo! True, it is a slightly higher quality, and there are some videos on it, but where's the surround mix of the album?"
4,Not The Same Avril...,"I loved her first album so much... All songs were awesome and catchy. Nothing was more reasonable than buying her second album to see what's up. Some said she was changed, and I didn't like that thing, since her past album was near perfection. She's very changed... unfortunately.Somebody has to tell Avril she's a pop singer, not a rock singer. What she has done in this record was a mistake, she's pretending she's a rock singer but she's not. All those guitar solos, a little heavy songs... It has nothing to do with her and her voice, and few to do with the Avril we've listened in ""Let Go"", you know what I'm saying? Avril, I hope you return to your ""roots"" in the next album.Best songs in here are indeed the singles ""Don't Tell Me"" and ""My Happy Ending"". This album may entertain you for some weeks, but not for years, like ""Let Go"" did... Still, if you liked her first album, you should support her, buying this one. I'd give it 3.5/5 stars, but I'll give it a 4/5."
3,under my skin...did she mature?,"her sophmore albumn isnt as mature as it was said to be, she's 19 and her lyrics and still rather simplistic, her singing range is mediocre and though her songs are less pop, they still maintain the pop edge that i found to become annoying after a while. nobodys home and forgotten would likely be the best songs. the real plus to the cd were the pictures, sad to say, on a plus they had an edge and though the songs are still immature, its a step up from her last albumn, but be warned, you might hate it after an hour of listening to it. with lyrics such as-""this is when i bite my nails and clean my room when all else fails-i think its time for me to bail."" not the most depth..."
1,THIS CD SUCKS! THE LAST CD SUCKED! AVRIL SUCKS!,"Lemme make my point, although you can probably see it in the title. Avril freakin' sucks. If she's so 'punk', she would have more punk rock music, but none of her songs are punk, she's pop. She's a pop singer who has issues with the real punk bands. Dude, she calls herself 'Sum 41's biggest fan'. I mean, I have the Sum 41 cd's 'All Killer No Filler' and 'Chuck'. I doubt she listens to Sum 41 because if she did, she would have some clue of what the hell punk rock is and her music wouldn't be pop. Just don't listen to her. You might as well listen to.. wait I don't want a whole bunch of little Avril fans chasing the bands I like around so I won't tell you who to listen to. Let's face it, Avril is a poser."
3,It's raining fatsos!,"Geez Louise, Funny. Nowadays, there are just to many fat people walking around outside. It's not safe to let your kids out on the street anymore! You never know when some stupid fatso might trip over them! Avril Lavigne is no different than those other idiots! She thinks she's skinny. YEAH RIGHT! She thinks shes pretty. YEAH RIGHT x POTATO! She even thinks she can sing. I LAUGHED SO HARD I CHOKED when I heard her say that. But, thanks to some fancy spanky production, Avril's fat CD is actually sort of good. But, she ruins it with her weight, which is so big, if she sat down, our planet would have total darkness. And it would be really smelly. But, if you can tolerate this overwhelming idiotic donut crunching monster, I guess it's a good buy. HEAR HEAR FUNNY!"
1,Avril Gets Under My Skin,"Avril is not a good song writer. ""Yeah yeah yeah"" ""Na na na na na"" Give me a break, she needs a dictionary or thesaurus so she can use bigger words and not rhyme the obvious single syllable words. What a poser!"
4,"Dissers who consider their ""Aerosmith, slayer"" better is sad","Give me a break,the girl is pop, she says she's pop, not punk/rock,she admits she sang country and in church,so just leave her alone.And for those people who dis Avril and think they are listening to ""real"" ""hardcore"" ""noncommercialize"" bands like Aerosmith and slayer, are just so pathetic.If you wanna make urself sounds more sophisticated,at least choose some real bands like Tool, A Perfecr Circle, Radiohead or something. gosh...Aerosmith, slayer, Rush are just poser Backstreet boys with guitar, with mindless repeating lyrics."
4,"Excellent work of ART...HAPPY,SAD,THOUGHTFUL.",UNDER MY SKIN....The title says it all. It's like her own diary in songs. These are not LET GO kind of songs but thought provoking. From the angry and sad NOBODY'S HOME to the super catchy MY HAPPY ENDING. This cd shows Avril in her mature state. From a girl who wanted to show the world that girls can be one of the guys to a girl who is a girl that goes through brake ups and sad events in life. A must have for any AVRIL LSVIGNE fan and for those who are not AVRIL LAVIGNE fans this cd will show that she truly is a singer/songwriter. A GREAT PERFORMANCE! THOUGHT PROVOKING!
1,That shrill voice!!,"Avril came around at a time when music was at an all time low. The rock scene has progressed little since 2002, when Avril arrived but someone should teach her a few lessons.Avril's songs just grate on my nerves. Day in and day out I see little girls dressed in ""punk"" clothing with their attitudes and playing their snotty Avril records. I have heard many songs from this album and generally they sound the same, nothing interesting at all.If you want to step up your music game pick up an Alanis Morissette album, she is Canadian, a similiar voice to Avril, but that's where it stops. Alanis has thought provoking lyrics, solid albums full of diverse songs and a VERY unique voice. Nothing for which I could say for Miss Sum 41."
4,AWESOME!,"This album was so cool. I personally think that she is the best younger rock star, alongside Katy Rose.Here are my ratings for the songs:Take me Away: 9/10Together: 9/10Don't Tell Me: 10/10. (Great first single)He Wasn't: 9/10How Does it Feel: 8/10My Happy Ending: 10/10 (My fave on this album!)Nobody's Home: 10/10 (Great third single)Forgotten: 9/10Who Knows: 10/10 (Awesome)Fall to Pieces: 9/10Freak Out: 8/10Slipped Away: 8/10I have to say, Avril's first album was better, but I love this one still.ROCK ON, AVRIL!"
1,Identity crisis....,"The last thing we need is another pop star sucking up the air waves; we have enough Michelle Branches and Jessica Simpsons already. And this one claiming to be a skater? I skated throughout high school, and I can assure you that rubbish like this was never listened to by me or my friends; we listened to Minor Threat, Pantera and Cypress Hill. What kills me is that this is actually popular; one of the guys at my work actually bragged about this album coming out, and I nearly slapped him. (...)"
1,Is this FUN?,"*stabs Avril voodoo doll several times with kitchen knife*Now THAT'S fun.This is a pop album, not rock. Deluded fans take note! I would call it humorous but it just annoys me. Can't sing, her voice is whingy and beyond tuneful. The main reason im going to this fuss to write a review though is because I have seen her in interviews and she comes across as rude, stuck up and generally vile in every possibly way. Has NOBODY noticed this?The songs are horrid and cringeful. Who would call a song sk8er boi with serious face? The lack of dignity is shocking.Though I must praise Avril for starting the craze of long straight hair and tomboy clothing for teenage girls, it means I can wear my fairy clothes without embarassment. I love my fairy clothes.A girl living opposite my house loves this album, or her other album I dont know. Whatever. She plays it loud sometimes. Pity me please."
3,CD Rocks but isn't deep,"I am a fan of Avril, and I loved her first CD. Her voice is supurb and she is really hot. In this CD the guitar riffs are good and really rock. There is a but to this album. She doesn't rely on meaning and words a lot. I love voice inductions as much as anyone but she could have thought of something to convey her thoughts. Music is an expression of feelings and ideas. The band did a good job conveying feelings but the lyrics lack the idea. Over all I would suggest buying this album, it is fun. The songs grow on ya. Love ya Avril look forward to your next one."
5,avril is the best,"avril is the coolestall of her songs has meaning in it and i really like thatbascially all her songs are really goodbut here are a few really good ones""together"" ""don't tell me"" ""my happy ending""""forgotten"" ""slipped away""!!!!!!!!!"
1,not worthy of one star,"i cant believe people dont think this is pop.It will be thrown in the closet within 2 months along with the britney spears,linkin park,good charlotte and other crap."
5,Avril rocks my socks!,This cd is packed with some great songs from Avril. All of her songs are from personal experinces. You should really go out and get it. The songs on here are so good you are blown away. This is another great album!
3,okay...it was alright,"First, I'd like to point out the fact that Avril Lavigne has never called herself ""Punk."" To blast her and say mean things about how not punk she is is pointless, because, honestly, she knows she isn't punk. This Album has some of the weakest display of lyrics I've ever seen. Sometimes it makes me want to cut my own throat. But, the music aspect has matured a lot more nicely. Thank God for that, because the lyrics gag me. But better music...And thank the Lord for no Skater Boi....."
1,you dcould spend your money on such quality music,"These teen queens just win you with flash and bang crap. The music has no substence. I liked it better when teenboppers bought britney spears and avril lavigne insteead of kidding themselves that this is better and that avril is anti britney and christina. she is just like them and her music is just as bad. nshe gets a one because she sold so many copies when you could have bought good music like The beatles or david bowie or people that actully are differnt like the ramones or good rock with a landie like blondie, but people buy this crap and are blinded by the smoke and mirrors that the media plays on them"
4,Avril Lavigne: Turned over a New Leaf,"Avril has change ALOT over the 2 years. And yeah, you've probably heard bad things about Avril like she dislikes her fans or she doesnt want them to copy her but that doesnt make her MUSIC bad. It's actually pretty good. I absolutely fell in love with her 1st album. (It's truly one of my favorites). I dont have the bonus track so I dont know what that sounds like but her single ""Dont tell me"" is good and I enjoy ""My happy ending"" On her 1st CD I loved every song, but on this I like everyone. So dont always judge her by personality with her music 'cause they're two different things (Like, I dont think Britney Spears is a good role model but some of her songs are good I must admit) So just give her a second chance. Wait til another single comes out and see if you like it or download one of her songs and see if that is good too."
5,Another great album,"I loved her vocals on ""Let Go"", amid the negative hype that sometimes would come up. This album is similar, but with some maturity heard in alot of the songs. Alot of the album has ""hit"" material, such as ""Take me away"", ""Together"", ""Nobody's Home"", and most of the rest. The lyrics are catchy, as they were in her first album. The song themes are of more adult situations than the first, and the lyrics have improved, although they were good in Let Go, also. A highly recommended album."
1,the worst album of all time!!,"don't believe the hype,she's worst artiest of all time.she 's punk?i doubt it,even stupidest person know it.don't waste your money buy the sh*t, it's not worthy."
2,think before you buy Under My Skin,"One, I could already tell by the cover and the title that I wasn't gonna like it, that it was not living up to Let Go. Let Go is a brilliant album that has helped me get through my pre-teen years.Under My Skin is less substantial, it has catchy hooks covered with fake lyrics posing as deep messages. The first two tracks are pretty bland and formulated. The only songs I like on this album are He Wasn't and How Does it Feel. He wasn't is an '80's like song with clever lyrics written just by Avril, I think. This is waht she has the potential of doing. HDIF is about feeling lonely and analyzing the souls around her; it's very good, it's a little sparse though.UMS proves that Avril has more potential for better albums once she gets past her teen pop stage. She still has to figure out who she is, though she hasn't explored her self-discovery at all on this album."
4,What can i say,"well actually i do no what to say. but this record dont but her first. her first isnt that good but this one is...i dont no y ppl go and say bad things about avril. i think in her second record it shows that she is creative and stuff cuz this time the only ppl who edited her songs were her friends. this is why u shudnt buy her first record cuz it was edited by producers and managers. anyway...its true that just wearing a tie doesnt make you original, but whos to say she isnt punk? we never met her, we dont no her lifestyle. her music, you can say without arguement, is not punk. its full of catchy chorus' which i will admit but, its not like it makes her a bad person. i like avril lavigne whether shes punk or pop or anything, this isnt about her clothes or what she says about herself and all that other sh*t, its about the music and nothing else."
5,One of the Greatest POP/Punk Rock Albums by a Female,"Her music is so unique mixing punk, rock, pop, and country into a great Album. Every song is well written and sung with perfection. There are atleast 4 songs that you can hum to all day, after day. Personal Favorite is ""Who Knows"", its so catchy it should have been her debute single."
3,good,Very good album for those people who are into love. This is mostly about her break-ups with a guy. Some of us can relate to that. The people who can should listen to this album.
3,She Really Isn't That Talented,I liked Avril's debut but this sophomore effort has made me realize that she really can't sing or write catchy songs. I'm a lil disappointed.
4,"SHE'S NOT STUPID,SHE'S ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD...","In 2002, Avril Lavigne released her debut ""Let Go"", which spawned some big pop/punk hits for her. Now, two years down the road, Avril seems to have matured on her sophomore album, ""Under My Skin"". The titile seems to represent the music's feeling-Avril gets intimate on this album, especially on ""Slipped Away"", which she wrote in memory of her grandfather. This is a good album to any pop/punk fan's collection, mature but pleasureable listening, nonetheless.:)"
4,"Okay, original drivers flaky, but...",GE does not actually manufacture Consumer Electronics (according to their website). The Consumer Electronics division is farmed out.The GE Reader uses PHISON chipset. Updated drivers are available here [...]The chipset in mine is the Pen Drive 1.0 Series PS1006(C) chipset.The reader chassis is a snap together case. You can open it with your fingernails and check out the universal USB interface chipset.I highly suggest using the NEW drivers for the PS1006 chip released 08-Sep-2004 version : v1.29r000 for Win98 (5.5 MB ZIP File)Hope this helps? Had to research this after reinstalling Win98 and loosing my install CD. :)
1,Please don't waste your time,"This should be the 8-in-1 card MISreader. Firstly, it was unable to correctly read .jpg files from an SD card, thereby rendering my viewer software incapable of opening the files. Secondly, despite two installations (with a complete uninstall between) of the device's driver according to the directions, the device consistently produced a &quot;plug-in error&quot; and was therefor unusable. GE, I like your products in general, but please recall this one."
4,I enjoyed this one!,"I have been enjoying Griffin's Badge of Honour series. This is the fourth book in the series, and I'm starting to feel like I know Peter Wohl and his group of Special Forces cops. This was a page-turner for me. I thought the story moved along quickly, and it certainly held my interest right from the opening pages where a robbery occurs at a family-run furniture store. I love the interplay between the characters in these books, especially between the Special Forces crew and the administration which includes the mayor of Philedelphia and the Police Commissioner. Griffin captivates with characters, and that just makes me want to read more. I can't wait to read the next one."
4,Wonderful,I just finished this book and can't wait to get to the next story. The characters and settings are so realist it feels as though I am right there in the offices and cars with the characters. The characters are like like long lost friends. The stories always take unexpected turns and I can never figure out how they are going to end. Philadelphia circa 1973 seems like an interesting place to be. Griffin is an exceptional story teller.
1,Just Plain Junk,"I purchased this coffeemaker because I thought Cuisinart was one of the best. I needed a small machine and this one seemed just right, I had high hopes. Well after two months it just stopped working. I purchased it in October and in December I tossed it into the trash. To have it repaired under the warranty you must send ten dollars, not to mention the cost of shipping it doesn't seem worth it. If it doesn't work after two months, how many times would I have to send it back in the next 34 months?? I felt is wasn't worth the effort it would take, so as I said before, today it went into the trash. I guess I should stick to Mr. Coffee, I have a ten cup for about six years and it works just fine."
1,worthless to me,"The product I bought was worthless to me. It was not compatable with my computer and it did not tell me that within the advertisement, only found out when I received it."
2,Summer of Deliverance: A Memoir of Father and Son,The book was in good shape except for the cover of which one half was torn off.
2,The story of a man with no self-sustaining ability,"Chris Dickey's book about his father's effect on him is not only a bore (unless you're a soap opera addict), but a deception. C. Dickey used the enormous fame of the movie ""Deliverance"" to catch our attention, then proceeded to write relentlessly about his inability to extricate himself from the psychological grasp of his father. Poor James Dickey: the guy was apparently responsible for his self-pitying son's every lament and weakness. In an attempt to make himself look normal, everyone else is severly faulted, include Burt Reynolds, Ronnie Cox, Jon Voight and Ned Beatty. In conclusion, what a boor Chris Dickey is. Good things to say? C. Dickey can write a great sentence, but one has to wonder whether he can do so without the influence of his far more talented--and HUMAN--father."
5,a good do at home class,"This video is not for the begining student. If you can do the New York City ballet workouts, but have never sudied at a studio this is not the video for you. It is a nice, intermediate class. Some of the exercises do require quite a bit of space, so be prepared to move furniture and to rearrange some of the center combinations. The class is fun and there is a lot of allegro and grand allegro combinations to get your heart rate up. It is a great video for an experienced student."
4,Worked Great,"ZX-600 G X 0.1 Digital Pocket Gram Scale Coin Digital ScalesThis scale is small and very accurate. It worked great for about 5 days but does not handle dropping well at all. I would recommend this product but I also recommend not handling with damp hands, one drop does it all.Bill in NC"
2,dont buy,i received this item and it did not work. I know its not the highest quality scale but i at least expected it to function. very disappointed.
3,"Pleasant, feels longer then it is","I was hoping this would be more enjoyable then it was. The comedy was clean enough but it was more 'pleasant' then funny, no laugh out loud moments. It was ok to rent and watch, but not a keeper for repeated review. Feels longer then it's actual run time."
2,"Good ending, but almost not worth the work","I agree this had a fairly interesting plot and ending, but it was an incredibly slow read, and seemed very repetitive in parts. I would only recommend this in an abridged edition."
3,This book was alright.,"If you need a book to read then pick this one up, but I wouldn't say go out and buy it. It is an alright book though, but the beggining takes a long time to reveal what the story is about."
5,Excellent book.,"I had been looking for this book as I'd read it when I was a child, and it came as no surprise that I found it here. I ordered it used, although you would not be able to tell that from the excellent condition of the cover, pages, etc. I was extremely pleased with my purchase."
1,Spice Girls ---Tribute?,"Ok, I'm sure I'll get slammed for this, but I actually have nothing against the Spice Girls....but a tribute album....already? Isn't that supposed to happen after a group or artist has been around for a while? If you like fun bubble gum pop (which I do every once in a while), then go buy one of their previous albums and have some silly fun. But don't waste your time on this one."
4,Bright but a bit heavy,Good Pelican product. The pad for the forehead is soft and comfortable. Is a bit heavy but it is worth it because of the power. Beam is a real tight square.
3,Bright but BIG,"The light is very bright and the battery life is great, But this thing is gigantic !!! Way too big for me. I use the light at work, on my firefighting helmet, and this light adds too much weight on an already heavy helmet. I need something smaller."
1,Made in China,"I was not impressed at all. I took this light snorkeling at night in six feet of water and it leaked. Also, the light beam is too focused. A larger cone of light would make for a better field of view. Very expensive for an item that is made in China."
1,Sirius s50- EX1 Executive System,The unit is already broken. I have it less than a month and the control knob in the front fell off and I can't find a place to have it repaired. I believe this unit was repaired before and currently I am very unhappy with my purchase. Sirius also does not suppoort this product any longer so I apparently wasted my money.
3,Is this book about Fed Ex?????,I was very disappointed in this book on Fed Ex. This is a great management theory book but really told me nothing about how Fed Ex is innovating again and again. I am hoping that someone will come out and tell us how Fed Ex as a company is succeeding but it is not this book. For those interested in academic management you will find this interesting otherwise don't waste your time and money.
5,"A must read, the book is more than just about FedEx","There is not a manager or executive throughout the world who would not benefit greatly from reading this book. In only 200 pages Madan captures the very essence of what is needed by any business in order to survive and thrive in today's economy.Through the story of FedEx he both illustrates why companies need to engender a culture of innovation and, also sets out exactly what is needed to execute on that strategy. Any negativity on the part of a reader will have more to do with their own personal doubts or fear of failure, for the ideas are sound and well illustrated.In the work I do I spend a lot of time reading management and success books, this is one of the best that I have read in a very long time. The linkage between Strategy, People, Process and Systems is as strong as I have ever seen."
1,Not sure what the aim was here...but it missed,"Not sure if this was a book to promote himself or explain the origin and inner workings of FedEx, but it was a pathetic mishmash and virtually unreadble. I now blame this guy personally when my FedEx overnight doesn't arrive on time."
4,Historical review,"This is not an action book, the plot tends to move at a very slow pace, although that is a personal opinion. If you like a book that reveals a part of history then this is a book for you. Even though the plot tends to develope slowly the author captures your attention from the begin to the end. There is little to no suspense in the book although the historical information comes at you so fast that it is hard to take it in all at once. The book is described vividly and is an sweet and unforgetable story."
3,"Slavery, freedom, truth in art","Juan de Pareja was a real-life slave of Diego Velazquez, the famous Spanish painter of the 17th century. At that time, it was illegal for slaves to paint. Secretly, however, Juan watches Velazquez and experiments with his techniques, painting. Juan is able, in time, to become free and to marry and to set his wife free as well.Slavery, freedom, truth in art---these are the great themes of this book.""I thought Art should be Beauty,"" he (an apprentice to Velazquez) muttered.""No, Cristobal,"" (replied Velazquez) ""Art should be Truth; and Truth, unadorned, unsentimentalized, is Beauty....I would rather paint exactly what I see, even if it is ugly, perfectly, than indifferently paint something superficially lovely."""
4,A sweet and touching vignette.,"This book is a sweet and touching vignette.Though it moves rather slowly and there is close to no action, I would call it capable of touching the heart of millions. One of the most touching and unforgettable moments was when Juan spoke of a small red flower and how the flower affected the love life of two of Juan's dear friends."
4,"I, Juan de Pareja review by Matt","I really enjoyed reading this book. It was insightful, well writen and made you wonder. Through out the whole the book I kept wondering what was going to happen. Although some things could have been better. For instance at parts the speed of the book was slow. Otherwise it was fun to read. I highly recomend this book."
2,"satisfactory, but not great","I read I Juan de Pareja for school and I thought it was somewhat uninteresting. It is about a Spanish slave and there weren't very many action scenes. The book talks about Juan, the spanish slave, working for the Famous Painter Don diego Valascuez. I would have enjoyed this book more if it were more interesting."
2,Slow,"I found the book to be a bit boring. I like to purchase historical books for my teens that will supplement their history lessons, in hopes to expand their joy of reading. I think this book will dampen it. I am looking for an alternative."
4,Very nice,"I credit this book with starting my interest in painting. It also opened my eyes to the cruelty of slavery.I read this when I was 10, and my memories are few, but I do remember that this book was very sad, and beautifully written. As a child, however, I had a very short attention span, and at times this book lost my interest. I remember it as being very long. I would recommend it to artistic and intelligent children."
3,"Review of ""I, Juan de Pareja""","I read ""I, Juan de Pareja"" for school. This book was not necessarily the type of book that I would read in my own free time, however, I did begin to enjoy it once I had been reading it for a while. The cover of the book also somewhat gives away the book after the reader gets about half way through it. Overall, this book was somewhat satisfactory, and I would not read it again, however, I thought the book was educational in describing life in the 16th century. I would recommend this book to anyone willing to learn while you read."
3,Sammy's review,"I, Juan de Pareja was a pretty good book, but I think that it could've been better if they had gotten rid of some of the charactures. I don' think that they needed to detail everyone that Juan had met. If I had wrote it I think that I would've focused on more of the events. Of course you need charactures to tell about the events but you don't need all of the small characters to explain the whole story."
3,Not that Interesting.............,"This book did not have any interest to me, especially considering that it lacked a plot. If it was not supposed to have a plot because it was a biography, then I guess that I just was not interested in the life of Juan de Pareja. This book seemed to be just a book of events, one after another. There was not much fluidity between chapters. However, I was able to get through the book withouth being bored out of my mind. That's why I give this book a three."
2,SLOW,"this book went really slow, JUST GET TO THE PONIT!!!! they talk about the same thing over and over again."
4,Good,"A good story about a ""negro"" slave boy that serves a spanish artist. Has Spanish history. Age 9 years old."
2,I was not hooked to the book.,"I never really got hooked on the book. Some parts were interesting but most of it was boring. The plot is OK and it is also developed OK. The plot was a good idea, but the way the author wrote the book was boring to me. To much detail can become boring. To little makes the book to hard to understand. The author put too much detail."
4,This is Gospel: The Dixie Hummingbirds,"We have tried every gyration known to man, to view the video documentary that is supposedly on the ""this isgospel"" The Dixie Hummingbirds... So how do we view it?"
1,The Companion Web Site is Terrible,"I noticed that several of the links in the book are no longer active. I went to the companion Web site hoping to get an update. Boy, was I disappointed! I found a little more than 25 links and nothing else! The companion web site was supposed to be a major selling point of the book, but it did NOT live up to its promise. Shame to the publisher."
5,Superb,"I have never seen a video of Tracey Mallett's until this one and I am so impressed. First of all, you can see she uses her body right, in a way that if you follow it, you too will have great posture and lose the back fat and muffin top. Second, every exercise in here is a bona-fide no bullsh way to get results, all using the current knowledge about the spine, pelvis and abdominals, how to use them right, strengthen them, and how to keep them in tip-top shape while you lift weights and move aerobically. I am SO GLAD I found this! Ms. Mallett is the real thing."
4,Solid intermediate workout,I had my third baby less than 4 weeks ago and started using this workout about a week after. The workout is broken down into segments all being less than 10 minutes each. This is working great right now because the baby does not always cooperate and let you get in your workout. It is challenging but definitely doable and easily modified. The cardio bursts can be done either low or high impact and you can always increase your weight. I started with 5 pounds. I definitely recommend this workout.
5,Great workout for fit moms (any time after baby),"I bought this video after having my first baby two years ago, and I STILL use it. It was very challenging at first even though I am pretty active/fit (ran a marathon while pregnant), but you can modify everything, and the instructor explains how to do so. It's a very time-efficient work out where you work legs and arms at the same time, and you can make it more challenging by using heavier weights, which is what I do now. The best thing about it is that it's split into six to eight minute ""circuits,"" which is PERFECT for squeezing in between other tasks or when babies or toddlers are cooperative enough to play on their own for a few minutes. These days, I spend the morning in my workout gear and just do 8 minutes as I can, when I can. By the end of the morning, I've gotten through the video.I looked at a lot of other post-baby videos, but most of them were either too easy or too much time commitment. This was perfect for me."
3,"Not a fan, but good workout","I'm not a Tracey Mallett fan. I have several of her DVD workouts and although they are all good, I can't get past her voice and they move a bit quickly, even for this experienced exerciser. Good workout and production quality, though."
1,Terrible,"Terrible - the thing that amazes me is that it is so badly written. I quote: ""Caroline smiled at her half brother, whom she had come to like once the fierce war over their father's estate had ended not long after she had become, all on her own, a successful newspaper proprietor, fulfilling what had been his dream."" Who does that final ""his"" refer to, for goodness' sake? The book is entirely composed of this kind of slack prose - an authentic disaster!"
3,A Silver Book For A Golden Age?,"Just finished (albeit an audio version -- long drive) version of The Golden Age by Gore Vidal. I've been meaning to read more Vidal (I still have Burr in my ""to be read"" pile) but other books just seem to get in the way.Vidal can certainly tell a story and each ""episode"" is quite distinct, but it didn't seem to really tie together. I'm not sure if it was the abridgement of it, or if it was just its episodic nature. The blurring of fact and fiction are interesting, and one must go along with Vidal's political, and vaguely conspiratorial theories of 1941-1954 to enjoy the work. It is hard to believe that even FDR could be that Machiavellian. His view of the elections and preordained are too manipulative for my tastes, though. The portraits of FDR and Truman are more complete than not however ad do tie in well with a lot of the biographical information. I'd prefer less fiction and more history in my readings though."
2,vidal's gossipy story,"I have enjoyed several of Vidal's historical novels including Lincoln. I've also enjoyed some of his other novels. This book, however was much too full of gossip, most of it about people that I couldn't care about. The characterizations of people like FDR were interesting (by the way, I can't beleive that Harry Hopkins was a Soviet agent). Also, there has been a great deal of criticism of Vidal's thesis that FDR knew of the Pearl Harbor attack and that Truman dropped the bomb on the Japanese in spite of their suits for peace. We will most likely never know the truth about these events (like JFK's murder)but his interpretation is just as valid given the facts that are known as anyone else's."
2,What am I missing?,"Some of Gore Vidal's work has entertained me a lot (Julian), but this book wasn't one of them. Maybe I'm just not sophisticated enough to ride with it. The guy is obviously a great writer, but I found 'Golden Age' to be just a string of gossipy dialogue sprinkled with some major historical facts, not enough of a plot to keep me hooked. If you like the kind of chatty Hollywood-style writing, you'll like it. If you like something more narrative, you probably won't."
3,FANTASY OVERDONE,"This could have been a great book but sadly it's just fair. The history is there in all its stark reality. The spin is necessary and overdue. But the problem is- too much inane dialogue, at times humorous but often tedious. Page 84- ""Dewey's no Jimmy Stewart. For one thing he's only three feet tall, with snaggle teeth."" ""Cap them,"" ordered LB as if Dewey were under contract, ""I've promised New York an October 1st opening. You'll be ready."" True, this is a novel but there needs to be some restraint. Page after page of banal banter. Still, it's an important literary endeaver."
5,Everything you need to know in one place!,"Production for the Graphic Designer promises to provide the reader with everything he/she needs to know in order to produce books and other graphic works. And this book fulfills its promise! In a thorough and lucid manner, this books describes, step-by-step all aspects of graphic production. My illustration instructor told me that this book is ""selling like hot-cakes"", and now I know why. I see this book as the final step in acquiring all the knowledge I need to produce my own books."
4,Great game for a non-hard-core gamer,"I have never watched the ""Dukes of Hazzard,"" but I did enjoy this game. It seems that many of the reviews are saying that it's really only worth playing through if you're a fan of the show. I guess I'm a counterexample to that theory. If you are like me and are not a hard-core gamer and really just get into the simple games that do not require hours and hours of gameplay to complete, this game is for you. The fact that it was simple, repetitive, and amusing made it the perfect game for me to blow a few hours with. This was one of the first video games that I have actually taken the time to complete, so that must say something for it. Although the graphics are not stunning, the cinematics that go with the storyline are just awesome. And if you can get used to the crummy graphics that come with the split screen, the two-player game ""run the jug"" is pretty fun, too."
2,there is no challenge in this stupid game!,This game is way to easy! I beat every level until i got bored and returned it. This game s[tinks] for a number of reasons1. controls s[tink2. horrible graphics3. way to easyIf you want a driving game get driver 2.
5,5 Stars,Everything from the game to the supplier to Amazon was 5 stars it was on time and my daughter was thrilled.
2,let down,"Don't get me wrong, this game is a lot of fun, but in the end is completely disappointing. First complaint: WAY too easy. It took less than an hour to complete the entire thing. 26 levels take you back and forth over the same roads, doing the same thing over and over. For some reason there only seem to be about four roads in Hazzard. Second: the handling of the General leaves much to be desired. It's actually more fun in the other vehicles. Too much time is spent trying to keep the car on the road to enjoy the ride. Third: too cheesy. Yes, so is the show, but this is overkill. If I hear Luke (""Dang it, Bo"") one more time, this game is done. Bottom line: this game is fun, but gets old quick, and doesn't make you want to replay it. I suggest passing on the purchase, and rent for an afternoon. That's all it's really good for."
1,Racing for Boredom would be more like it!,"I waited forever to play this, and found out that it stunk. The car was easy to handle, and drove well. But as the game progressed, it didn't become more difficult. I was hoping it would be more challenging. I actually got to memorize the roads some. I played it beginning to end in less than four hours. I did enjoy having many of the cast of the TV show reprise their roles for the voice-overs in the game."
2,Not as Cool as I'd Hoped....,"When I saw this game advertised in a magazine, I was counting the days 'til it's release. ""Dukes"" was my favorite show growing up. So as a Dukes fan, I was pumped. Then I rented it.I beat the game in a couple of hours, despite the repetitive play and poor controls. In fact, the biggest challenge the game gave me was to be sure it hadn't cancelled my Analog light during the level transition (which it did frequently).All in all, the excitement of a Dukes game carried it for the first couple of levels, then it just got boring. And howcome Roscoe can ram me like I'm standing still when I'm going full-throttle and just flipped him on his roof ten seconds ago?The cool concept earns it two stars, but the poor gameplay trashes the rest. Hopefully there will be a sequel that will make this one look like a mistake. And how 'bout more of Daisy in the next one? Please?"
4,The Dukes of Hazzard: Racing For Home,"This game is fun. The car handling isn't the greatest, but the game makes up for it with how much fun it is. It's not your modern day awesome graphics strategy game, but it's still cool to be able to drive the General Lee at 90 mph down a dirt road while running from sheriff Roscoe. If you're into classic games, and are looking for something to do, you should definately play this one."
1,Don't wast your money on this dvd!,"I purchase this DVD and sent it back, Is a totally wast of your money it is nothing is just scenery view from the front of the train is not anything to do with history or career!"
3,Interesting ... Interesting,"I did not buy this book from Amazon.com. I purchased it from a store. I picked up the book, read a couple of the reviews from the book and thought I would find the book enlightening with a little amusement. Boy, was I wrong!! The book showed a review from Publishers Weekly ""A provocative, infuriating and downright funny chronicle of the sexes."" With this review, I thought ""hmmm this may be insightful but have a little humor."" Don't buy this book if that's what you are looking for because you won't find it here. The book is well written and it's hard to believe the views of the women were written by a man."
3,Not Impressed,"I am a ""Tito Nieves"" fan i think he is a great salsa singer. But lately his musical productions are not considered the best in my opinion. His most recent falls in the same catagory, not impressed at all. I heard it once and i haven't heard it again. I am losing the anticipation when i hear he's coming out with a new recording. In my opinion he must do some thing better than what he's doing now. ""Tito don't forget the TRUE SALSEROS."
5,Any booklover will love this,"It would be difficult for a book lover not to thoroughly enjoy this collection of writings about books. A great resource for thinking about books, reading and writing, for ideas about how to go about reading and writing, and for just finely crafted writing by lovers of books.Bascove's art which adorns this collection creates a marvelously private, cozy, bookish world where voices seldom sound aloud, and the world outside is muted, allowing the reader or writer to be in the world on the printed page."
4,owls (floyd scholz),THIS IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL BOOK THE PICTURES ARE STUNNINGBUT I THINK THE BOOK COULD HAVE HAD MORE TEXT.ALSO AMAZON CLAIMS THE BOOK HAS 512 PAGES. THE COPYI PURCHASE FROM THEM ONLY HAD 379 PAGES.
3,tape,"I bought this to help organize my dvd's, it would be better IF Dymo made blue tape instead of printing in blue. It's a bit faded. It does do the job, but perhaps sticking to the black print type would be best."
3,Fairly weak for James...,"I read this one a few years ago, and I have to rank it at the bottom of the list (along with ""The Europeans"").Though Fleda Vetch can be fascinating in a Hamlet-esque way (through her infuriating inability to act), this novel is far from a must-read as far as James goes."
3,Not the Master's Strongest,"I give this three stars in an internal world where 5 is James at his best. In comparison to most fiction the rating would be higher, but as a DEVOUT fan, I live in my own internal world. In that world, James who was more critical than any of us, would understand that in comparison to other later era work and even middle period work, Spoils does not live up to his best. It is fun and light, another reviewer mentioned obvious signs of a stylistic shift perhaps being too obvious here. That feels on the money to me. That said, if you've read almost everything, it is a light turn with the Master and that has something delicious in it no matter what."
3,NO Design,"This book has many code examples, but no design. A better name for this book would have been ""An Example of Coding ASP.NET Applications"". I would like to of seen some design diagrams."
2,Misleading book title,"this book isn't that bad as describe by the others readers who rated 1 star. In fact, it is elaborate some of the in-depth concept pretty well. unfortunately, this book doesn't surve the purpose of designing a real world applications. it's merely teach very fundamental of Asp.Net and doesn't really teach how to design an efficient and scalable asp.net application. I would rate more star if the title is Asp.Net in a nutshell"
1,Absolutely Awful,"If you're thinking about buying this book, don't. Go with a reputable publisher who puts out quality work like O'Reilly or Wrox. This book is a piece of trash. The only ""interesting perspective"" it provides is the nearly half of the book that is dedicated to praising what a wonderous achievement the .NET platform is. The author just can't get enough of telling people who already bought the book that .NET is better than Java and actually is an original idea. Well, he does a lot of this and very little of teaching the language. There are very few examples, and those that are there aren't useful at all. The index is also terrible, making this book also worthless as a reference book. I really can't find any redeeming qualities about this book except that it's printed on fairly high quality paper. Far better than it deserves. If you're completely new to this, it might be useful as an introduction, but there are better books for that as well."
3,Not great book.,According to MS-Press this should be for advanced programmers. Truth is first 100 (4 chapters) pages are just waste of money.Chap-5 (Web forms) Chap - 9 (ADO .net) are the only useful chapters. If you know ASP. NET and want to learn more this is not the perfect book.
3,tis book is OK,"It include some useful info such as Configuring an Application,but didn't cover how asp.net access a serviced component (com+ application written by vb.net or c#). Actually, there is none of asp.net book cover that part. I don't know why cause I foundwin form and web form handle serviced component in different way."
2,Just didn't like it.,I read this book just after reading a really good C# book. This one paled in comparison. The writing is weak and hard to follow. I only made it about half way before I got bored and moved on.
1,The Worst,"Of the 25 computer books I've read this year, this is the worst.I paid less than $2 for this book and may keep it for reference, but the author has no clue how to teach a subject or how to write about it. I suspect the outline was made by the publisher because the table of contents looks good. Unfortunately, everything between headings is poorly explained."
3,A CUTIE,"I bought this as a mascot to sit next to my radio (I'm a Ham!) and his name is ""Dah."" {I also have a fat round piggie that is named ""Dit."" :D }I have no clue how durable this is for children because I just have it sit there next to the radio."
1,not good at all,I bought this one at Walmart thinking it would be well accepted by my grandsons. The oldest one asked me to turn it off and the youngest one totally ignored it. I am so disappointed and wish I had never bought it.
2,So So,"Not as exciting as Elmos dancing with the Stars. Daughter watched it twice, now its collecting dust on the bottom shelf."
4,Awesome bad guy!,Fun to play with other Star Wars figure - great in role play with other friends. My son loves it!
5,Great Value,This is a great Amazon shopping experience - resulting in the purchase of some cameras batteries with good life and great value.
5,It does what it's supposed to do...,I bought two of this since my battery doesn't last the whole day if ever I make continuous photos and video recording. Charging time is quite the same as the original battery that came with my camera. And it does last the same as the original one.I haven't used it as extensively though but still I'm satisfied with my purchase...
1,get what you pay,"this is a cheap aftermarket battery, I bought it because of the price. it worked fine for a couple of charges but then all of a sudden won't hold the charge as soon as i turn the camera on take 1 or 2 pictures the low battery indicator appears and the device shuts down due to lack of power, i put it to charge and after like 5 min says ready but the result is the same.Do not reccomend this article"
5,Great!,"So far, it seems to pretty comparable to the Canon battery that came with my camera. I took dozens of pictures with it before it died. No problems yet!"
1,Poor battery life,I used it in my Canon SD400. I tried it for 2 days. After each full charge it did not even last 100 shots (50% flash). My 3-year old Canon NB-4L (original battery that came with the camera) still lasts as much. I bought this from BargainCell. The name on the battery says GT Max.
2,"Underwhelming... Worked fine, then didn't","Okay, yes, it is SUPER cheap(from eforcity). But no, it didn't last as long as a brand name battery. If fact, after 6 months, it has become as bad as the Canon battery that I was trying to replace. Worse maybe. Now it barely holds enough charge for a short day of shooting. It would be a terrible ecological choice, but honestly, it would still be a valid idea to buy like 5 or 6 of these for the price of one brand name battery and charge them all before an important trip. But who wants to do that. In short, these batteries suck, but they are so cheap, they might still be worth it!Stick to eforcity's cables and adapters... skip the batteries."
5,Very Pleased,"Incredible delivery Service.Received early morning of the third business day!I used these batteries on a recent trip. They charged well, fast, and delivered the appropriate charge duration.A bargain! Thanks to this seller."
4,Equivalent Quality - Amazing Price!,"The Ultralast is simply as good as any Canon camera battery. I always have at least three batteries when I travel, not always wanting to take time to charge batteries. There is nothing worse than having your battery go dead when you are in a rare moment of taken great shots. I also photograph while SCUBA diving and that is not the place to have your battery go dead. There are many types of batteries and I've purchased one from Korea. It worked just as well, but the battery life was less. You can also never be sure if a questionable battery may leak and damage your camera. For the price of the Ultralast compared to a Canon, I'd strongly suggest having at least one Canon battery and a few Ultralasts on the side."
4,haven't used it much,"The only reason that it didn't get 5 stars is because I haen't had it long enough to determine if it will last a long time. So far it works fine, just like the original cannon battery. It charges good, I didn't time it to see how long but plugged it in, and let it run its course. I bought another kind of replacement as well and cannot tell the difference between it, this one, and the original. Sp it gets two thumbs up!"
1,Bad Battery...Beware!!!,"I purchased 2 of these batteries from eforcity and neither one lasted for more than about 10 minutes worth of casual shooting. I purchased other aftermarket NB4L batteries and had a similar result, but I also have purchased other aftermarket batteries and they worked fine. I don't know how to tell which cheap aftermarket batteries will work and which ones won't.**UPDATE** Eforcity did give me a refund for this product after I left bad feedback, but that doesn't make the batteries any better."
1,Banned in Texas Prison System,I tried to send this to an inmate in the Texas Prison System...it was denied...it is on the banned book list.
3,Not as much info as I wanted,"My daughter was the victim of a stalker, who will soon be facing years in prison. Unlike a lot of the people who read this book, I purchased it because I wanted to read what a terrible place prison is so that I can feel that he is truly being punished. While this book did answer many questions that we had about the arrest procedure, bail, etc. I would have liked more in-depth information about day to day prison life. The book just gives a brief summary about most topics, and doesn't go into detail at all."
1,Interesting Book About Prison,"I think the book was written to the wrong audience, it should have been written for the general public."
1,Not much useful information,"This book is not very useful. Its very simple and real advice is missing. You learn more from prison life by wathing a good prison movie.For example, their only advice against the rapes is that you should fight back hard with all of your strenght. Well no s**t Sherlock?! This whole book is full of this kind of tips."
1,Terrible,"As a teenager, I learned more in a San Francisco Drunk Holding Tank about encarceration/prison than I did reading this BORING BOOK as a full blown experienced adult!! To be honest I got half way through the book, then trashed it. I had previously read other reader's thumbs down review of this book and yet I still bought it! Oh, Its a really odd size book! Its almost a flat bible size book! Bizzare!! Boring and useless info is my opinion... David"
2,Not for females who need to survive,"There is some good advice in this book, but it is really only for men who face incarceration. There is a scant chapter devoted to women, which in my experience offers little useful info.Of course, if one is facing incarceration, any good advice is very slightly comforting."
4,Practical advice for the newly incarcerated,"Many incarcerated people who have ""done time"" know much of the information in this book; however, there are several useful topics to consider. This book may be most appropriate for the first term inmate. The authors wrote another book, ""Beyond Bars: Rejoinging Society After Prison"" that offers in depth parole planning resources. Still, this is a valuable tool for those who work with the incarcerated population since it contains information that one must know in working with this unique population."
1,This Book Is a Con,I read this book out of curiosity and it blows! The advice in here is so simplistic that any moron would already know just about all of it through common sense (or from being locked up). Don't waste your stolen loot on this book.
5,I never knew...until I read this book.,"This book is a must read for anyone of any age, sex, race, or criminal background. I found this book extraordinarily informative on the basics of prison life and some of the precautionary steps to take. This book opened my eyes to aspects of the legal and prison system that I was completely oblivious of before. I highly recommend this book to counselors and teachers working with troubled youth and/or adults or just everyday citizens who think that this could never happen to them. Ross and Richards do a wonderful job of describing the basics of the prison system in a way that everyone can understand and learn from."
4,Put to good use,"A family member is in a county prison, so I sent her this book. She said she loved it ... even found some things to laugh about ... and passed the book amongst all her acquaintances there."
2,OK,"This movie is ok! It is mainly dumb! All the people do is sit around and talk! Dont get this movie,get something like Jaws. The only good part is the begining! The rest is plain boring. I like the first episode a lot better!!!!!!!!!!! If i had to get this movie id get the first one."
5,viwer,The BEST ALLIGATOR movie of it's kind!!!!!!!!! GET IT! BETTER THAN THE FIRST! I give the first one only 1 star. This on is way BAETTER!!!!!!!!!
3,Alligator 2; The Mutation,"The freaky sequel to the 1980 blockbuster, ""Alligator 2; The Mutation"" is another sickeningly horrifying film about a mutant alligator devouring a community and its residents. This time Hodges (Joseph Bologna) is the movie's hero, a gruff cop who soon discovers that a toxic waste dump planned by evil town-corruptors in the local lake has mutated an alligator into overintimidating size, and it has began to attack people. Along with his girl and a Cajun hunter named Lynch, detective Hodges attempts to stop the scaled menace from its man-eating rampage. Directed by Jon Hess and produced by ""Alligator"" Productions (you wonder why). I didn't like how the gator attacked so many people in the stupidest ways. I hate how it always attacks the wrong prey. In the first hit it ate an innocent little boy in his own swimming pool. Good for horror-film lovers, but to me is very lame."
1,Why did they make Alligator 2?,"This movie s[tunk]!!!!!! It is a complete ripoff from the orignal and worst of all there is no plot except for big giant Alligator that terrorizes this city. see the original, don't waste your time with #2."
1,not that bad,its mainly dump but its not that bad.the alligator looks fine especily with those red eyes.it takes awile for the alligator to come but when he does its bloody for its rating and it attacks a carnival but that was a little cheesy and it has copeyd scenes from the 1st like where it copeyd one of the best parts from the 1st where the alligator is going in the pool. RATED PG/13 FOR BLOODY VOILENCE A LITTLE BIT OF GORE. AND BRIEF LANGUAGE.
3,Good Movie. Worth Watching,this movie is alright. it's about an alligator mutated by toxic waste living in the sewer. at one seen a homless man is in the sewer. he calles for his friend and the alligator pops out with the guy in his mouth. it looked fake. it was like cardboard with fake teeth with a guy in his mouth waving him around. you would expect him to eat the guy. and when two guys are in a swamp and the alligator eats one of them. you then see a boot with a foot in it float to the top like in JAWS. when the alligator is swimming he's smaller then when he ate the guy. the movie is good enough to see though. i liked it a little. it stared Dee Wallace Stone from CRITTERS which is a very good movie if i may say so. so rent this movie if you think you'll like it. it's pretty good.
1,SO BAD IT MAKES ME SICK,"Alligator 2 is so terrible I wanted to puke when watching it! The alligator looks bad, the acting is not the greatest, and the plot is a rip-off from Piranha, which already crossed that line. So, if you want to see a great crocodile/alligator movie, see Lake Placid or Crocodile."
3,Nathan Hale,"This biography of Nathan Hale, written in 1912, is designed for what modern readers would call Juvunile Non-fiction. Any middle school reader would derive useful information from this book. I would not recommend the book to adult readers of history."
5,Must Read for all divers,Excellent Text. Will help keep you and your dive buddy safe. If there is a problem you can be prepared. Easy to read for all divers. You need to read this so you can help yourself. Its a long boat ride to shore.
5,Awesome book! A must have for anyone!,"I have to say this was by far the most helpful and honest book on Christian and secular sexual issues and questions. It used the word of God accuratly and gave no room for justification and spoke clearly. It hit on issues that people just refuse to talk about these days. I am a 21 year old Christian female, and I am getting married in just a few weeks. This book has put a new perspective on how I am going to be sexually in my marriage and I also belive it is a great tool for singles in helping them to remain faithful in their purity commitments with Jesus."
5,Wonderful Book for Singles or Couples,"I read this book right before I married my husband. We are both Christians, but I am quite a bit more conservative than he. He didn't really understand why I am so unwilling to publically discuss sex and I don't understand why he is so open with it. I read this book and got SO much more than information about sex from it. It really helped me and my non-reader-husband read just part of it and I could see a difference in his understanding of me. This is a great book to help you see what God thinks of sex and other intimate issues. A plus is that most of the references are KJV."
4,The Royal Navy in European Waters During the American Revolu,"It's a good book!It gives you a real description of the Royal Navy during the American Revolution but lacks of descriptions of the Navy Ships; besides this detail,I recomend this book."
3,interesting book,"I thought this would be more of a narrative on instilling christian values in a child. It took more of a psychological slant and seemed almost new age at times, yet the information contained was sound and sensible."
4,"surprisingly complex ""cozy mystery""!","complex plot; interesting characters, realistic understanding of historical background; the characters and subplot twists were able to keep me interested in this mystery"
3,Far too many characters for such a short read,"I would have liked to have seen some of the peripheral characters who did nothing to enhance the story omitted. Also, a bit more historical background references would have improved the substance of this book."
2,"Attention to detail, period atmosphere; some weaknesses","Gardner's prose invokes the geography of Regency London and the social distinctions among the nobility, the bar and courts, the upper middle class, servant classes, law enforcement such as it was, and the underworld. I fault her portrayal of Captain Lacey, a half-pay veteran of the Peninsular wars, because he lacks either the religious outlook or the sex life characteristic of an Englishman of the period. Lacey sustains several platonic friendships with upper-class women. There's lots of sturm und drang with an old friend who married a former military mentor and superior officer; antagonism alternates with reconciliation and apologies. No resolution appears on even the distant horizon and the reader grows wearied with the drama of the ultimately pointless subplot."
4,INSPIRE YOUR BOYS TO READ!,"It is so nice to see beginning reader books for boys. This book would fall into the catagory of a first chapter book. The chapters are only a couple of pages long, with large type and a picture every page or two. Girls will like it too, but my girl would be concerned about the flies (they get glued to a popsicle stick!). A nice book modeling doing something nice for someone else, in a funny, non-preachy way. This was the first of this series that we have read. I'll sure buy more! Thank you, Mr. Brouwer, for encouraging my son to read!"
1,Horrible quality!!!,"For the price, you would expect this to last more than one round of golf!!! It ripped by the 10th hole, do not reccomend at all!"
1,defective golf glove,"This is a terrible golf glove. I bought 3 and 2 of them fell apart before I finished a round of golf. The coating crumbles and then the vents in the glove become holes. A glove should last longer than a round of golf!!!! Save your money on this one!!! They have a manufacturing problem!!Good news to report---The company is a reputable company. When I contacted them about their glove, they indicated that the seller must not have stored the glove properly or the gloves were too old or seconds when I bought them. They felt this could have accounted for the problem with the glove. They replaced my defective gloves. I love the glove and would buy it again."
3,pills,"either my system already works great, this does nothing, or i can't tell if it does anything. For me, i haven't noticed anything improving or worsening so i can't say if its worth recommending, that would depend on your state of health."
3,Counseling SUPPLEMENT,"If you are looking for a book to read about your relationship with food exactly, this book isn't it. This book is more for counselors to use with their students or clients. It's not horrible, but I wanted a written chapter book not a handout book. Each excerpt can be copied and given to youngsters.I guess this book wasn't what I had in mind, so it did disappoint me a little. The excerpts does talk about emotional eating and why people over eat which is crucial to understand. But honestly, I do not like how the book is set up.It may suit some, but this book didn't do it for me."
4,maddening melodrama,"This was an insightful collection of stories that took you from the every day to the every way. Some stories need not be told and some even never tougt of at all, but in general it was a wonderful way of feeling like your not a lone with a story for everyone. Even you tree lovers."
4,Sturdy Wine Shelf,The shelf is very nice and fits very well into my kitchen decor. I do like the looks of this and it is very sturdy. The biggest problem for me were the wall anchors they included in the box. They didn't quite work for me. I ended up using my own anchors. I think the price was a little bloated for what I received though. Reasonably this should've been priced around $35 not $50.
5,Just like the product photo,"got this item quickly, put it up and really like it! Great for display of wines and glasses."
5,Worked out PERFECT!,"I currently live in a tiny place and needed somewhere to store my new wine glasses. I found this product here and it was a great purchase. Easy to hang, looks great, and was a GREAT price. Love it! I highly recommend this item!"
3,Don't trust this seller for their delivery times,I ordered a wine rack from this company and they promised delivery 3-4 days prior to Christmas. Let's just say I did not receive the item until a week after. Very frustrating!!!
3,"Worth it if you're a collector, otherwise...","WILDEST DREAMS- This is the same as on the CD, with the exception of Nicko's counting removed.PASS THE JAM- This is a rather interesting track. This isn't much of a song as it is an improvisational jam session by the boys, runing 8 minutes long. It's actually a pretty funny and catchy tune, especially when Bruce sings ""FACE THE NORTH!!! AND THE EAST!!! AND THE WEST!!! AND THE SETTING SUN!!!"", as well as the part where he announces ""I'll scream next. I will."" then he does so twice, only to announce later ""I warned you. I'm going home now."" Again, a funny track, not meant to be taken seriously.BLOOD BROTHERS (ORCHESTRAL MIX)- I can barely hear any difference here, maybe just some added synth. Not worth the time, just listen to the CD version.In short, buy this only if you're a collector like I am."
3,Cheating on fans,"I am big fan of Iron. but I can't stand simplicity of first single from Dance Of Death. To my liking, it's one of the worst track out there! But I bought this single for so called orchestral mix of Blood Brothers. And now I can say just one thing - is this some f***g joke? This is the same thing that on Brave New World!!! They cheating fans! And previously urealeased track sucks. Definetly worthless thing."
4,the songs are great,"For a debut album, especially that of a three piece, this is brilliant. Working within the tight constraints of guitar, bass, drums and vocals, this actually comes off very well, despite its all over the place sound ( it reminds me of a K-tel compilation in its diversity ). Even the novelty cover of Foxy Lady, with its almost smug "" rock is dead"" deadpan vocal delivery, is amusing, if nothing else."
3,Killing A Song ;-),A nice remastered 2-disc version of an album which is a classic for post punk era and pre-new wave. The songs sound a lot better than before but some stuff on the second disc sounds terrible (especially live stuff!). I hope that the next round of remastered Cure albums get a better treat. And why do we miss Killing An Arab on this one? Wasn't this a single in the same era? I thought it was! Anyway... it's good enough for me. Cure fans should buy without any doubt.
3,Stop Remastering! (Unless you do it right).,"Just pointing out that the beginning of The Weedy Burton is missing (studio chatter). The end of Three Imaginary Boys has too much silence (guess the pro remixing idiot didn't hear the studio talk) , don't these people at least listen to the original mix, before they RUIN it. There may be more wrong, but I'm too piffed off to listen again."
1,Kindle version appears useless,The paper versions of Oxford World Classics are excellent. They have excellent notes which appear at the end of the book that are keyed to line numbers in the text. The line numbers have been stripped from the Kindle version! This doesn't really matter because the Kindle has no significant hyperlinking. From what I can tell the Kindle screen is excellent but the software is primitive and only good for reading something without any references or footnotes. Amazon has a way to go before I'll buy a Kindle. Does anyone at Oxford know what Amazon has done to their publication? Run away Oxford! Kindle is winning you no friends!
5,Great book. A must for Worshippers,"Great book about worship. All worshippers, ""Worship Leaders"", and Ministers should read this book. Talks about all sides of worship- not just music. Some of the book has the authors opinion.. which I (as a 21 year old Baptist) didn't agree sometimes. but that is expected.. overall great book"
4,Very interesting,"Impressive given the era in which this was written. Sinclair is a good and sincere writer,however I was disappointed that he did not continue to remain a vegetarian."
3,"Not the traditional story, but enjoyable","I'm old enough that I learned the legend of La Befana from my Italian immigrant grandfather.......this is a new formulation, probably designed to teach children not to hate ugly people. It's okay, but I miss the real story - you know? Sometimes being politically correct is just not the answer. Befana was scorned by everyone because she was ugly, but she sought out the Christ child because she had a beautiful heart."
4,good mini series -Jult Warfell,I would have givin this series five stars had it of been 22 to 26 episodes long. Sooooooo much to offer as far as story and character design is concerned. -Jult Warfell
4,What is reality?,"At first when I saw they used CGI for the Gundam scenes I was turned off, but it actually all works well together. There is a nice mix of action and drama with good dubbing. I also thought the entrance music was really great to start off the show with. You will get all four episodes on this disk which in turn is the whole series. Extras include trailers, textless songs, and the original preview. You follow the life of Toru Soma, a computer hacker with amazing skills. He belongs to a group of computer hackers who call themselves Steppin Wolf. The group decides to have one final hack and then disband, but who knew this would be the one that would change their lives forever. When one of Toru's friends is killed by a military operative, he vows to join the military and find the killer. Little did he know of the secrets he would find. So which of the two worlds is real? What is reality?"
5,A brilliant play,"Required to read Henry for my AP English Language class, I came into the play with a bias. I honestly felt that it would be a boring political play. I was utterly wrong! A huge fan of Shakespeare, I found Henry V to be a formidable match for the Bard's more critically acclaimed plays, such as Hamlet and Macbeth. Henry has it all! Shakespeare's attitude toward Henry the King is certainly one of admiration. By communicating the fact that an effective monarch must have a complete understanding of the common subjects (Pistol and Bardolph and Quickly), Shakespeare sets up Henry to be the ideal Christian king. The controlled language of Henry's speeches, particularly his response to the Dauphin's idiotic insult, also glorifies Henry. I certainly recommend this play to anyone, fan of Shakespeare or not."
5,"We Few, We Happy Few","On D-Day British officers read Henry's famous words to their men as they approached the beach. When Churchill needed material for his famous ""Few"" speech, his thoughts turned to the pages of Henry V. From ""once more into the breach"" to ""we happy few, we band of brothers"" this play resonates with Shakespeare's paen to England's warrior king. Oh, you'll be a bit confused at the start if you haven't read Henry IV parts 1 and 2, but this is primarily the story of Henry V's victory at Agincourt. Whether the play glorifies war or just Henry you will have to decide. There is much food for thought here for the perceptive reader. But then Shakespeare is always provocative."
2,Poorly formatted version of a great piece of literature,"I have been enjoying the play itself but it almost seems like they just scanned the book into Kindle format with no regard to making it an easy and pleasurable experience. Words, spacing, and lettering are not infrequently misplaced. A linking system to the footnotes does not exist but is basically mandatory for a body of work that uses so many archaic words. With some unnecessary work, I have been able to get through the material. I do not recommend getting this edition although it seems to be the most popular of all the Kindle editions."
4,cute book,I put this in my 6 year olds easter basket and she loved it. It came in great quality even though it was used. I was very impressed.
5,It should be mandatory that everyone reads this book 5x+,This book will change your life for the BETTER if you open your mind and allow it to make sence. Then practice what you read. I suggest this book to be mandatory reading to every single home in the world. Like a bible for the minds.I highly reccomend this book for everyone
4,Makes you think,What if this life is little more than a dream?What if everything is somehow connected?These are but a few of the questions that this book will leave you asking.I was given this book 8 years ago at my high school graduation by a friend of mine and it took me until now to sit down and read it. I'm glad I did.I think I now have a bit of an understanding on what's been holding me back.Now all I have to do is get through it!
3,I didn't hate it but I didn't love it.,It was okay. The information was good but I didn't realize it was all different pieces from past books and live lectures. I also thought it was kind of short. Only two hours worth.
2,waste of time,"This book is a complete waste of reading time and money - Mr. Dwyer is too self-serving and seems pompous,."
5,The Best Book Ever Written,"Although all the books written by Dr. Dyer are extremely helpful, this one really makes you a better person. This book enables one to become at peace with oneself & others. Should be made 'compulsory reading' in colleges."
5,You'll See It When you Believe It.,I haven't finished reading this book yet but so far I am really inspired by it. I would recommend it to others who want to change their life for the better
4,Well-written,"This is a well-written book full of wisdom and insights. The title of the book, though, is not ideally chosen as it doesn't perfectly match the content of the book. This is not so much a book about manifestation, as the title may suggest, but a book on synchronicity and acceptance. Apart from that, it is a highly readable and thoughtful book."
2,A disappointment,"I had heard some good things about it, but ultimately, it was a real let down. Much of what he says I've heard before. Nothing new, not even new twists on the same ideas. And some passages had the essence of that Smiley character on Saturday Night Live. I had to laugh. All I can say is I'm glad I borrowed it from the library!"
1,Disappointing,Seems as though Wayne just randomly pieced together this CD. ABSOLUTELY nothing like the book which I value beyond words.
2,"Been there, done that","Although I agree in general with Dr. Dyer's philosophy, this book was a major a disappointment. There's far too much restating of ideas he's expressed elsewhere dozens of times, and far too many encounters with adoring fans gushing about how wonderful he is. The book might be of interest if it's your first introduction to Dyer, but I recommend ""Pulling Your Own Strings"" or ""Your Erroneous Zones"" as more stimulating and less egotistical. (Maybe he's improved in his more recent books, but this book annoyed me so much that I haven't felt motivated to read them!)"
3,"Entertaining, but shallow","Mandalorian Armor is a pretty entertaining book, and I was really looking foreward at the end to reading the other books to find out what would happen. However, the reasons for Fett destroying the Hunter's Guild seemed contrived, and it seemed to me the author was trying to make the story more complicated than it had to be. I got the sense that the overly complicated and involved intrigues were merely an excuse for action, rather than the reason. Ignoring these faults however, the Mandalorian Armor is a good read. Summary: more action, less nonsensical excuses for said action."
5,A plot with a lot of twists,"A lot of people didn't like this book, but I thought it was great! If you like Boba Fett, this is a must read! This plot has a lot of twists, and it's neat to see that even peolpe that are as good as Boba Fett run into trouble when they're outnumbered, (unlike Han Solo, etc.)"
3,"Star Wars -The Mandalorian Armor, Book 1 of 3- (Seafire12)","When I read this book I soon relized that this was just a setup for books to come. Everything is left unexplained. I thought it was interresting how the story jumps around from past to present, but it makes the story somewhat confusing. The characters are a little out of line and Boba Fett talks to much. If you think your questions that are left unanswered in this book are explained in the next one...think again. They aren't explained until the end of the last novel in this confusing series. Even then things are loosly tied up."
3,I'm very sorry,"It's me again. I have another review down there somewhere. I recently reread this book and realized that there were some mistakes in my review.first the characters: Bossk-dead on target. He did not die in Prize Pelt. He dug out I think.Dengar-too wimpy. His character was okay but he wasn't the physical speciman we know from Payback.4-LOM-his appearance in Hard Merchandise makes him out to be just a little flat. He seems to simply tolerate Zuckess rather than be friends with him. At least Jeter tells us why. (The events of Sahdows of the Empire.)Zuckess-too stupid, whiny and not intuitive enough. Nothing els to be said.Boba Fett-close to the target but Crispen, Moran and Montogomery did a better job.IG-88-Yes he did exist and the character was dead on too. IG-88 was created around I think a year and a half to two years after ANH. The THEN part of this book takes place around two and a half years after ANH. Check Ted Edwards Timeline in the excellent Unarthorized Star Wars Compendium."
2,Great premise....not such a great book,"I normally avoid any sci-fi books like the plague. I am an avid Star Wars fan though. So, the premise of Boba Fett surviving the Sarlacc's digestion was intriguing. Then I found myself wound up in the author's world where the bounty hunter's are at war with one another. Like most Star Wars novels, the writing is dull and witless."
3,Who is the real Boba Fett? We'll never know,"Well I generally like Jeter and his style of writing so what happened here? Hated the way the storyline jumped back and forth in time, and I was more interested in Dengar and the slave Neelah (who ended up hardly being in the book at all) than the basic one-dimensional members of the Bounty Hunters Guild. Where HAVEN'T we read characters like that before - in every darn book that's where! Use stereotypes much? Well background and some personal histories would have been compelling, but too bad for us. This book was not what I had hoped it would be. And how many times do you have to use the word ""barve"" and the adjectives ""obsequious"" and ""coruscating"" before you're all used up? Geez."
4,BOSSK AND ZUCKUSS WERE TOGETHER THANK YOU VERY MUCH,"As my title should have indicated to everyone, I am well aware that Bossk and Zuckuss were partners in this book. Next step, get over it.4-LOM wasn't in the book. Maybe that is why Bossk and Zuckuss were working together.Granted Dengar didn't act like the superman we thought we knew, but oh well, he is in love (regardless of what we think about this, it did happen. Like he says in Tales of the Bounty Hunters now he has something to lose.)Barve was a little over used. Maybe a lot. Okay, I'll be happy if I never hear the word again. Now I'm going to get over it.I agree that Xixor should not have appeared in this book. He is perhaps the only villian that I really hated. I was so stinking when that barve was blown to atoms at the end of Shadows of the Emprire by Steve Perry, nicknamed the b-word.(Barve)"
4,good but lacking,"I think that many of the characters in this book were out of character, including Boba Fett. At times he just said too much, in the trillogy he had four lines total. inparts of this book he talked for pages at a time. I also think that the Boba Fett tales in Tales of the Bounty Hunters and tales from Jabba's Palace were far supierior in getting the character of Boba Fett right.The paring of Zuckuss and Bossk is rather odd, wasn't Zuckuss' partner the droid 4-LOM? Zuckuss too is out of character, in this book he seems like a young kid who is just learning the ropes, in Tales of the Bounty Hunters he was experienced and had Intuition. That is a big jump for just a couple years difference.Other than that the book was great. It had lots of twists and turns in the plot. And I'm wondering who Neela realy is, I'm in the process of reading Slave Ship. It would have been better if Jeter got Boba Fett's character right."
5,Slow but good,"This book is about Boba Fett so you know it can't be that bad , just try it. It starts slow but next thing you know everyone is schemeing against each other.BY THE WAY, WHAT THE !#%$^*& IS A ""BARVE""?"
2,OK but lacked the Star Wars edge,"I read both this and Slave ship, and I was severly disipointed. Jeter had a good idea but he ruined it by getting the plot a little too twisted. The Zuckuss and Bosck pairing really didn't belong at all. When compared to Tales Of The Bounty Hunters this book and its siqual sucked. Jeter should have stuck to writing Blade Runner and stayed away from Star Wars, because those long boing conversations that have little beariing on the plot don't Belong. All I can say is that I wish I hadn't bought this book because now I feel that I have to find out how the trilligy ends. P.S. Denger is not the bumbling fool he was made out to be"
4,review,"I get the impression that a lot of the people who read this were expecting something different. While I haven't read any of Jeter's other work, I was clued in to his intentions due to the fact that he'd previously written a novel calledNoir. Put simply, this is hard-boiled crime fiction set in the Star Wars universe. (I get the impression that Jeter was looking to authors like Richard Stark for his inspiration.) While it may not work 100% of the time, I feel there is definitely enough to recommend to those who enjoy those two elements. I was also impressed by the fact that Jeter managed to make Xizor an interesting character. True, he doesn't have much more than a cameo here, but he made more of an impact in those few pages than he did in the entirety ofShadows of the Empire. As a first entry, it has me interested in checking out the rest."
3,"Can you say ""barve?""","First of all, I nearly gagged from reading the word ""barve"" on every page. I wonder if the author knows what a thesaurus is...? But I haven't read any of this author's other works, so I can't judge how the book campares to them. Second, I had a hard time keeping the time jumps straight. I found that if I took a day off from reading the book, I had to re-read a bit of the previous chapter in order for it to make sense. Thirdly, I almost fried my brain trying to figure out who was out to get who, and what everyone's motive was, etc. I haven't read Tales of the Bounty Hunters yet, but it seemed like Bossk was an adolescent heading for an anger-management program, and Zuckuss was too dang dense to even be a bounty hunter. From what I've heard, these characterizations are not accurate, based on other Star Wars material. However, I liked the Dengar/Neelah storyline, and I dig Prince Xizor. All in all, it was so-so, but not great."
4,Can't wait for the next book in this series!,"This book adds intrigue to the 'behind the scenes' action of the main Star Wars story. If you like Boba Fett, you can't miss this book. Kud'ar Mub'at is an ingenious character addition. The spy video of Luke's Aunt and Uncle being killed is fairly interesting. Great story for anyone interested in the bounty hunters and subplots of Star Wars."
4,Great Book with a few wrong facts,This book gives a lot of insight into what Boba Fett had done during the Star Wars Trilogy. The only problem was that a few thing that had been written before were in contradiction with each other.
4,An interesting but confusing plot makes for good reading.,"The plot of this book really explains the events surrounding Boba Fett and his initiation into the Bounty Hunters Guild, escape and recovery from the Sarlaac as well as the main plot of the book namely, Xixor's grandiose plan to destroy the Bounty Hunters Guild and twist it's destruction to the Empire's and secretly Black Sun's. Be warned this book may have a confusing plot development. Each couple of chapters are part of either NOW, THEN, etc. Enjoyable for Stars Wars fans all over."
2,Has the author ever seen the trilogy?,"The author of this book believes, among other things, that you can fire a blaster by pressing your thumb on a ""Trigger Stud""This book was full of inconsistancies with the rest of the Star Wars Universe and is recommended you dont waste your time with it."
5,"Great Read, Exciting from Cover to Cover","This book (and the rest of the series) is awesome. I read it when I was eleven and wouldn't recommend it for anyone younger than that due to violence and back-stabbing. I loved it because there was a new twist on every page. I am a Star Wars fanatic who has about 10,000 pages of Star Wars reading under my belt and I still could not predict all the exciting twists and turns. I'd say that this Bounty Hunter Wars series most likely makes my top two list, the other contender being the books by Zhan. Overall a wonderful read!"
3,disappointing,"This book was disappointing. The plot was weak and I expected more out of this book. The conversation that Xizor had with Vader and the Emperor seemed to drag on and on.... And also, Zuckuss was displayed as a complete loser. This suprised me because if he was one of the bounty hunters called aboard Vader's Star Destroyer in ESB, then he must've been one of the top in the galaxy, not just some wimpy bounty hunter tryin to learn the ropes."
4,Not a bad book,"I found this book a bit confusing the way it went backwards and forwards through time, one minute Boba Fett is near deaths door and the next he was at a banquet. A girl named Neelah said that there was a connection between her And Boba but she did not know what it was, and we never got to find out what it was. I thought the end of the book was rubbish and the parts with Emperor Palpatine and Prince Xizor were so boring.Other from that,the book gets a thumbs up."
2,Could've done better,"Jeter should have reviewed more. I saw several mistakes in the story line. Dengar messed it up alot, Neelah is a mystery and the droids are flat out annoying! But, the Transhodan Family ties are not very close. Bossk was plotting against his own father and his father was plotting against him. And, Zuckuss was portrayed as a wimpy little side-kick. Boba Fett showed far too much emotion then is portrayed in other books. The book is mainly for information only. If you're only into information, get this book."
2,Jeter just messed up,"I feel that Jeter just didn't research his book well enough. He made several mistakes(in my opinion, I may be a little behind on what has happened in SW books lately). The plot was boring, no real battles fought. The idea to flash back an forth was a good one, it was one of the things I liked, and it helped. In the end of the book, it had Bossk seemingly kill Fett, yet this was during RoTJ, yet Bossk supposedly died in Tales of the Bounty Hunters. If he somehow escaped, Jeter should have at least touched on that. Jeter made some of the same mistakes he made when he continued on Blade Runner, but at least he did it, when no one else did. He is a newcomer to the SW universe, so maybe his second book will be better."
3,An Ok book,Like I said this book is ok but it is a little strange Like the Fact that you are going from one time to another.It's like reading 2 books that have almost nothing to do with each other(I'm not done yet with the book) that get a little strange. It was kinda cool to learn about Fett and the other bunty hunters past.i never really knew anything about guys like Dengar(Who said nothing in the movie at all)and Bossk (who hissed once in the movie).All and all an ok book.
2,Unworthy book for such a great story line,"Of all the star wars novels, this is the only one that I struggled to finish. From very uninteresting dialog, to very short and lame action parts, my interest lagged many a time. I also felt the author tried sticking in to many different characters and then left out putting any depth into them, may be in the next two novels the story will fill out, but I for one am not holding my breath."
1,A Really Bad Idea,"I have no idea why George Lucas would allow this book to be published, and my only possible explanation was that he didn't read it. This trilogy was meant to be a story about the infamous bounty hunter Boba Fett, and his adventures after the events of Return of the Jedi. The attempt might have succeeded except that the author makes Fett out to be some sort of super-human reminiscent of a Marvel superhero with a much darker personality. This has the effect of reducing everyone else to a level of total obscurity. All of the other characters are dull and almost identical in that none of them are as good as Fett. The only redeeming quality of the series is the occasional flashback to Fett's hunting career prior to the original trilogy. If you want to read a good bounty hunter book, get Tales of the Bounty Hunters, but don't waste your money on this one."
3,Slow but good book,"This book was slow and boaring like a whole chaper of Darth Vader and Emporor Palpatine talking like 30 pages very boaring. But in the end when you finnally got into the battling and Dengar going into town and those guys following him that was good, but it seemed to end abruptly. And too much talk about discribing things like almsot a whole page discribing something. Don't waste the time reading the beggining just start from like the middle of the book."
2,two stars is way too many now that i think of it,"""The Mandalorian Armor"" lacked any kind of plot or suspense and is an all around bad book. K.W Jeter left me no reason to keep on reading. Bobba Fett talked way too much, considering Fett only has one line in the entire Star Wars movie trilogy, but appears. It has lots errors. Like it says the Slave 1 is a high speed ship, and yet in the Essential Guide to Vehicles and Vessles it says that the Slave 1 is about as fast as a Y-wing. I would reccomend that no one buy this book."
2,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"THE MANDALORIAN ARMOR is K.W.Jeter's (weak)attempt at writing a star wars novel.The main problem i had with this book are its annoying continuity problems.Zuckuss as Bossk's partner?Given,both were seen as a team in SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE(the comic)but with 4-LOM also.Fett also says to Bossk,""I was hunting before you were spawned"".This can't be right!In THE ESSESIAL GUIDE TO CHARACTORS,it says Bossk is 58yrs.old!In TALES OF THE BOUNTY HUNTERS,it states Bossk has HUNTED(!)for over 60yrs.!Judging by either,Fett would be very old at the end of TALES.Also, the use of the word ""barve"" is highly overused.The only reason i gave it a 2 was because it was about Fett!'"
3,The worst Star Wars book I have ever read!,I did not enjoy this book like other Star Wars books.What is with the time changing?It is a very confusing book.I gave 3 stars because it was an okay book.
3,Audio Book - 3.5 Stars,"After reading several reviews, I decided to listen to the abridged audio version over reading the novel. 3 hours of listening was just about right for this story. I would have to give the audio version 3.5 stars. I suspect that reading this novel would take 6-7 hours and unnecessarily lenghten it's plot.I like how the original trilogies events are intervowen with this story. I'm looking forward to the next two audio books to see how this series fits in with the Original Trilogy and Shadows of the Empire."
4,Best read in one sitting,"For the most part this book is excellent, and it features the return of the greatest bounty hunter Boba Fett. There is one drawback that includes not this book but the entire series and that's the flashbacks. At times they can be confusing especially if you'r elike most of us and have to put the book down every so often."
3,"Pretty Good, for a beginning...","The book was good. We find Boba Fett naked, in the sand, who was found by Dengar and his bride manaroo, though Manaroo is not really in the story. Instead, he and Boba join with Neelah, a dancer from Jabba's palace who is trying to find her past. I liked the ending solution to their current problem, and I was intrigued by Kud'ar Mub'at, the spider-like schemer, Bossk, the carnivorous bounty hunter, Zuckuss, the coward, Xizor, the kinda boring evil planner, and one of Kud'ar Mub'at's little underlings."
4,1 of the better SW books,i enjoyed the book ok i couldn't put it down but i hope some of the loose strings get tied up in the next book and since when did Zukuss team with Bossk that what loses the fifth star other than that it's a good book a must for every SW fans collection
1,Truly dreadful,"The plot is very weak and makes no sense, furthermore it has nothing to do with Mandalorians or their armour, what on earth possessed the publishers to allow this man to profit from this drivel."
2,Do not bother.,"Well, if you throw out all continuity with the rest of the Star Wars universe - at least that according to previously published material - this novel might be engaging.Major problems:1.) the character of Zuckuss is NOT the character met in _Tales of the Bounty Hunters_ SS ""Of Possible Futures: the Story of Zuckuss and 4-LOM"" by M. Shayne Bell.2.) no mention of 4-LOM anywhere, instead Bossk is teamed with Zuckuss?3.) One character Dharhan is introduced as a tease into Boba Fett's past and then summarily killed a hundred pages later.4.) IG-88 is a different character than that presented in all previous material, especially ""Therefore I Am: The Tale of IG-88"" by Kevin J. Anderson.And there are more.If you prefer material that is consistent with the SW universe do not read, buy, or even acknowledge the existence of this book. How it got past the presses and published is beyond me."
1,Avoid at all cost,"Now, let's get this straight, I am a big fan of StarWars and I loved the novels but this one doesn't belong in the StarWars universe. Why you ask? 1 reason. Boba Fett is alive. What the ? He can't be alive, we saw him died in ROTJ. I can't beleive Lucas let this thing pass like it was normal. I'm sorry but this book isn't worth the read. The story is long and there is no point in telling it. SORRY! but avoid it. It's for your own good."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable,I liked seeing a different side to Boba Fett other than just explosions. It's nice to see how he can think quickly on his feet and have plans thought out well in advance.
1,Now I have some toilet paper,"This whole three-book series was a month of reading garbage. This is a whole month of my life I'll never get back. The author made the bounty hunters look like an incompetent bunch of keystone cops. What's even worse is that the author made Boba Fett seem like a tender-hearted guy just trying to make his way in the world. Whatever! Now, I'm going to the bathroom with these books and only I will return."
2,definatly not one of the better interpretations of starwars,"This book is pretty bad in my opinion. The author has trouble with basic syntax of the universte. His phrases are clunky, and obvious cut and paste jobs.. things like ""wait a Standard Time Part"" and other such gross substitutions..."
5,BobaFet stars need we say more!!!!!,all about our favorite star wars bounty hunter .... filled with a butt kicking story about the greeatest bounty hunter in the galaxey
1,barely readable,"this book is over long, filled with poor characterizations, and ridiculous. it is a completely unnecessary tale, once vader and palpatine show up and continue a pointless conversation for five pages where they act nothing like themselves i lost complete interest, this novel was a chore to read, skip it and read some zahn..."
1,Jeter broke the cardinal rule of SW book writing...,"...WATCH THE MOVIES FIRST!The author seemed to miss out on some finer points of Star Wars trivia (such as: Bossk was not Zuckuss' partner; 4-LOM was), and had trouble in adjective use (EVERY SINGLE TIME he tried to describe Boba Fett, or a character mentioned Boba Fett, the word 'barve' was used to describe him. For instance: ""You better stay away from that barve!"", or ""He is such a barve, man!"" What is that? 'Barve' isn't even in my dictionary! And it was used like, 200 times!). In addition, the whole premise of the book is ""unrealistic"" in Star Wars terms. A bounty hunters' guild? Right...P.S.: The character ""Kuat of Kuat"" also annoyed me. I think that's a dumb name."
1,Crud from someone who should know better!,"WARNING! This from K W Jeter. The man who aspires to be P K dick. Ha Ha Ha! The guy must be hard up for cash! His other works are great, but this...? I love Star wars, but with the exeption of Heir to the Empire the quality of the novels has been terrible! This is no different. The plot is terrible with many contradictions both within itself and Star Wars lore. How much padding!? this is a blatant attempt to turn a single book into a trilogy by filling the pages with rubbish. For example; Xizor telling the Emperor his ""master plan"". Waffle waffle waffle. Avoid this book if you have any love for Star Wars and it's originality. This book just drags a wonderful phenomenon into a Dagobah like swamp!"
1,Garbage.,"While no Star Wars book can be called literature, this novel makes a mockery of the writing profession, as well as showing a lack of respect for the Star Wars Universe. Jeter seems to have done NO research into the characterizations--particularly Boba Fett. None of the bounty hunters is believable. His dialogue is amateurish. The plot is incredibly simple. I regret that this book is Jeter's first foray into Star Wars, and not his last."
1,"Boba may be great, but this story isn't....","Telling a story with Boba Fett opens a world of possibilities, but this book falls flat on its face. There is little point to anything that happens in the story. It's a struggle to read, and the only thing that kept me going was the hope that Boba was about to do something exciting. At the end, I was glad it was over, and I'm not exactly jumping up and down to read the next one."
2,err....,"I thought the book was ok but, there is not enough character development. The book described Boba Fett in great detail and he never acted out of character. This did not apply to the other characters. I found that they were always acting in ways that contridicted previous descriptions. Example: When Cradossk and Zuckuss are talking, Cradossk goes from a guy hooked on Honor to a bookie.If you've never read any other SW books i suppose this is ok but if your a SW freak, like myself, you might find this a little dissapointing."
3,ok but whats up with fetts past?,i thaught the book was a ok. but the book is supposed to be about boba fett right? so we know nothing of his past. all we know is that he was present when d'haren became a killing machine. and that he has earned the right to wear the mandalorian armor. but how did he become a bounter hunter? or meet d'harhan? or who were the others that were like d'harhan and how did fett know them? if jeter would have switched between one story and a explanation to some of fetts past the book would have been much more interesting. but since i am a SW freak i am very much looking forward to the next book in the series.
3,Katharine Isabelle+Bad CGI=Cheesy Fun,"OGRE is about a group of modern-day young people who stumble upon a centuries-old colonial village where no one ages that's under the control of a warlock who keeps the townspeople in line with the aid of the title character. The CGI monster was bad but I at least got a good laugh from it whenever it was on screen. One of the young people who find the village is played by Katharine Isabelle, who was awesome and hot in the Ginger Snaps series as well as other films, and she brings her said awesomeness and hotness to this film. If you like silly monster movies or are a fan of Katharine Isabelle(guilty on both counts here), you'll enjoy this. And keep an eye out for Katharine in the upcoming American Mary, 13 Eerie, and Primary."
1,it's K if you REALLY like ogres,"well it's not that good, but if you absolutely love Ogres and can only watch movies with ogres in them then this is the movie for you. SPOILER: there is only 1 ogre in this movie, so dont expect a lot of Ogres."
1,Very Bad,This is one of the worse computer effects I've seen. The Hulk was about as bad. The problem is the Ogre doesn't look real. It looks like a computer effect. It looks fake compared to the people.
1,It's really getting old...,"I don't know who is responsible for Kindle Books as far as formatting, editing, etc., but pictures that are only half there, tables that change font size from page to page, and words that are so badly spelled they are barely recognizeable reflect poorly on the author, original publisher, transcriber, and seller. I am really getting tired of paying for poor quality.Add to all that the fact that this book is just old information reformatted to appear new and therefore ""better"" just makes matters worse.I am most certainly glad that Amazon has such an easy return/refund policy!"
4,A very nice watch,"I recently purchased this watch for my mother, and I received it just the other day. The watch is dainty yet sturdy, and while the leather band gives the watch a casual description, the timepiece itself actually has quite an elegant look. As for the cost, the price on amazon can't be beat. Low cost + high quality + elegant look = one happy customer. I give it 4 stars now only because my mother has yet to receive the gift. Once she opens the package, I will update my review based on her response."
1,Defective...twice!,"I fell in love with this economical little watch when searching endlessly for a nice little brown leather strapped timex. Then I sent the link to my Secret Santa. But when I received the gift, the watch didn't work. Correction: it only worked if you HELD in the crown! The second you let go, it stopped. So I exchanged it for another, waited, and alas...the same thing. What a shame! The watch is so pretty, so perfect for someone like me who wears both gold and silver (it's sort of two-tone). Not wanting to chance another, I returned it and ordered a Seiko. It was very disappointing, and embarrassing as this was a gift and I had to have the buyer's credit card credited and she needs to send me a check. How awkward!"
1,"Stay ..... away.... Far, Far away","This game is OK if you're a kid, or want something REALLY simplistic. The graphics are good, but it moves way too slow.If you want a good game, try FIA Rally 99.This one is a waste of money if you are serious."
3,Required Textbook,"I bought this book because it was required for my ENG 102 class. Even though it is used it came in good condition. My class is only six weeks into the semester, and we've used the book a few times. Hopefully I get more use out of it by the time the semester is over."
1,Too Brief -- Almost no information,There is very little information in this article. In my opinion it is waste of money to buy it. Better to search the web for information about Tenant-in-common 1031 exchanges. Perhaps you could also find the information in some newer books about 1031 exchanges. I am still trying to find more about the Tenant-in-common property purchase as part of a 1031 exchange. This article did not help me.
1,Did not work,"This product worked fine for one day.After that it begin to pull away from the wall and top of tub, will have to try another brand ."
1,Save Your Money,"Agree with the other reviews. I hate to caulk so this seemed like a good solution. We installed this on a tub per the instructions -- even used goo gone to clean prior to installation. The tape just doesn't hold onto the tub/tile wall and it also left gaps in the grout lines that honestly didn't look very good at all. Twelve hours later, we are on our way to the store for some caulk."
1,Just a terrible product,"I tried this product in my main bathroom about 3 years ago and it's just plain terrible. The caulk strip doesn't stay put. After a couple of days, it starts to come undone. Why this manufacturer markets this product as suitable for bathtub caulking is beyond me. I recommend just using traditional regular caulk when you want to caulk your tub instead of this garbage. NOT recommended."
1,Not worth it!,This product looked great and was easy to apply but after the first shower it began to pull away from the wall and top of tub. Having to remove the product is no easy task either! I would never buy another product like this ever again. It's easier to just use caulk!
1,KAULK,NOT ENOUGH ADHESIVE.DOES NOT WORK.WAISTING MONEY.VERY CHEAP STUFF.BALOONEY.NOT RECOMENDED.DO NOT BUY.I AM GOING TO RETURN IT. GARBAGE.JUST ADVERTISEMENT.BETTER LOOK FOR ANOTHER BUYER
1,WORTHLESS!,Strip split down the middle as I was pushing it down with my fingers to adhere it. And removal of the broken strip and the surrounding strips was very easy. Too easy. This product is poor quality. Just accept the fact that you're going to have to run a bead of caulk and spend the time and money that you would have spent using this on practicing with your caulking gun. WORTHLESS
4,Great for grills,I have used this stand for years with different portable gas grills. It works well by sitting the bottom of the grill on the stand and letting the grills legs hang off. It works great as a stand for my Cobb Cooker also. I bought it to use with my coleman gas stove. I can't remember when I last used it for that but I don't recall any difficulty.
1,Pagan Society: Girlsz Play(Mehhhhh),"Yeah, I obviously made a mistake purchasing this disc, bigtime. This wasn't even worth the $11 or so I paid for it and I used my amazon giftcard, what ?! Please, under no circumstance let the title fool you, it's not erotic and it's not sexy, period. The models, if you wish to call them that are not really hot or attractive, their not even lukewarm at best. Not only that, the entire time on this disc is less than 20 some minutes, total rip-off ! So, if you're looking for something erotic and sexy, avoid getting this tripe, it's not worth wasting your money on.There's plenty of other decent dvds of this category to choose from, rhis however is not. Oh before I forget, a second disc came with it, supposedly a comedy of sorts, nothing was funny as I pulled my own hair out."
4,Roads of Destiny,"This is a fascinating short story. The roads signify the different direction we can take in life. When reaching a crossroad, we follow the main character (David Mignot) to the left, the right, and the center. We follow him through trials, and despairs. The carefully written descriptive writing brings out the crossroads each person has faced sometime in their life. I wondered if O. Henry himself was facing a crossroads because he seemed to be very invested and exact in the detail given to each path. He consistently kept the story interesting and leaving your curiosity wanting to know more. Though it isn't edge-of-your-seat exciting, it makes the reader think about their own life choices."
3,Roads of Destiny,"""Roads of Destiny"" written by O Henry creates a different way of looking at the paths in life we take. His theory reveals that it doesn't matter the paths we take but our destiny is sealed. Whatever we do does not change or hinder it. Through reading O Henry's thoughts, one must acknowledge how we should make the most of what we want for our lives-self goals/accomplishments- because we only have one life to live and death may come sooner than one might think. Who wants to die an unhappy death knowing that your life was useless and you didn't achieve your goals?"
4,Road of Destiny,"This is a very interesting story that provokes one's thought on the roads we choose in life. O Henry has proven to be a most unusual and point-making author. His short stories always have a good point, like this one about the roads we choose to follow and how they effect our future. It shows the true weight of our small or large decisions we make on the roads we take through the clever written plot. It even shows how different choices can even land in the same end. It shows the volatile or unreliable, nature of our decisions. It is cleverly written to keep your interest and has a appealing twinge of sardonic humor in it that keeps you captivated and reading more. I suggest this engrossing work of O Henry to a deep thinker or people making big decisions, or anyone who loves short stories with peculiar morals to them."
1,Book Makes Light of Inappropriate Behavior,I bought this book to read to my 2 and 4 year old girls to have another way to talk about sharing nicely. The book was a complete disappointment. The reader goes through pages and pages of the siblings doing mean things to each other and in the end the only thing they truly shared was the chicken pox and their mother. My 4 year old kept asking why they were so mean to each other and did not want to read the book again. I never showed it to my 2 year old. I did not appreciate the sense of humor and only found the incidents portrayed in the book as a model for bad behavior. I am throwing the book away.
1,Not helpful,I bought this book thinking it would help teach my children to share but these kids were just mean to each other. Not a book to read to your little ones!
1,Very mean spirited book!,I ordered this book from Scholastic books because I thought they were a good judge of books. I was wrong. It is very mean-spirited. I actually think I will just throw it away as I don't think it is even worthy of being donated to a thrift store!
3,Eh...,"I was hoping it would look a bit more like a koala bear. If you're shopping for this, consider how you will feel if someone can't recognize what animal it is."
5,kaola bear,It didn't take me long to find what I was looking for. It had a good price on it and was delivered in a timely manner.
4,great color pictures,This book is a great way to see how fashion works and all the things that is in the job the pictures are great if youre thinking about being a fashion designer than you need to buy this
4,Great Gift,I bought this as a gift for a preteen intersted in Fashion Designing. I flipped threw it. From what I seen it does a great job of going over things. They enjoyed the book a lot.
1,this book sucks,"i don't know what these other people are talking about, but i bought this book thinking it would be great for my little sister who is an aspiring fashion designer, and i thought it would be a good book due to these other reviews, but i was very very disappointed. this book sucks."
4,unexpected story twists,enjoyed the book and although it changed direction quite a few times the plot remained consistent and i really enjoyed the read.
4,Facinating and Romantic,"I don't typically enjoy novels about war but this story is so much more than war. I found the lives of the journalists, photographers and relief workers facinating! It's a wonderful read and well worth the time!"
3,read it for the ending.,"The topic sounded very interesting but I was not drawn in. Not until the end of course. The ending was great and the book overall reminded me of ""A prayer for Owen Meany"" in that the book did not excite me until the end, at which point I wanted to read it again."
3,A little too white,"I bought this chain to go with a white gold pendant since a white gold chain can be very expensive. Unfortunately, it was not a good match. The colors are way too different. I have a silver chain that looks a lot like white gold, but this one is too white. It looks too fake, even for silver. I wear a silver bracelet every day and it looks too white next to that one as well.An ok choice by itself but I would not pair it with white gold or even another silver item."
2,"Yellow, Yellow, Yellow","I'm sorry to say, but the Cover Your Gray stick in Light Brown/Blonde did not work for me. The color of the stick looks OK. But on your hair, it is too yellow. I have light brownish hair, and when I used this stick on my roots, the yellow color stuck out like a sore thumb. I don't even think a light blonde could have used it. I've never seen anyone with hair the color of this stick. I'll have to go back to the Medium Brown, which has always been a little dark for me, but does the job. These sticks work great, when you can get the right color. This company certainly needs to come out with more color choices."
3,Lipstick for Hair,"Product does cover the gray, but the hair color looks ""flat"" and dull. No shine at all. Maybe I just have too much gray!!"
3,"Effective for small touch ups, but sticky and heavy.","This will cover your grey, but I do not recommend it for those with a full line of roots to cover. It is sticky and heavy, and it will rub off on your fingers when you touch the area you use it on. I would choose a marker style grey cover that is liquid over this."
3,Messy to apply...,"It does what it is supposed to do. However, the product is really creamy and a bit messy when you apply it. It is also difficult to control the application of this product to just the hair and not the scalp. If it wasn't so messy I would have rated it higher."
3,Cover Grey Stick,"It was hard to find a good shade of Red. When I used it, I was a little disappointed, as the color WILL rub off on your Pillow Case. Also,it was difficult to apply to the Temple areas without getting the product on your face. Perhaps if it was slanted at the end, it would help the application?"
1,rip off,You're better off using your own mascara. It works as good maybe better! Whenever I need a touch up I just use my own mascara and it works perfect!
3,Good coverage; Doesn't affix,"Provides great coverage. I'm pregnant and can't die my hair. I have a large area to cover. The touch-up stick works great for coverage. But I find anytime I touch my hair, the product is all over my hands. In this respect, mascara works better."
5,A Color Stick to Dye For,"When that gray starts creeping into your temples and brow hairline, this ""Cover Your Gray"" stick is a simple, easy, effective solution. The only problem was the difficulty of finding Light Brown anywhere! I tried locations in CA, NY and FL but only found Black or Dark Brown. However, thanks to Amazon my search is satisfied!!"
1,nah,"I DO like the liquid touch tip applicator in med brown , but not this one.Its not easy to go on and its the wrong color for me- great lipstick color though!"
2,Not so much,"Well there is very little in this book that is not referenced info that is better read else where. The author basically just tells you about sexual teachings but does not really delve into them... just says lame things like ""be interested in your partner"" . Not what I had hoped for...."
1,"I never even got this book, NOT HAPPY!","I ordered this book for a friend who gave me money for it. The book NEVER showed up. I contacted the seller about it and never got a response. I contacted Amazon. They are looking into the matter. I WANT MY BOOK, or my money back."
1,Violent and inaccurate - this is one book you should avoid!,"When you read a book where the main character has the same name as the author, you would probably expect it to be autobiographical. But in this case, it is not. Shakers do not have families; they are celibate. In fact, Shakers never were even in Vermont and there is no book of Shaker. Aside from the base false premises of this book, the graphically violent incidents are also worth avoiding. From the opening scene of the cow giving birth to the scenes training weasel dogs by nailing in a barrel or violent mating of pigs, the lengthy, graphic descriptions can be quite disturbing. There are harsh realities of growing up on farms, but this book sensationalizes more than it informs. There are so many other quality books about farming and boys coming ""of age"" - choose one of them instead."
4,"Good, but a letdown from the first album","If you've listened to the first album, and loved it, you'll probably be disappointed by this one.. It's good, it's Duncan Sheik, but it just doesn't have the same power and emotion.. If you don't have either, I highly recommend the first cd.."
3,I'd call it OK,"This seems to work better than most of the ""under $100"" headsets. People occasionally say they can't hear me. If I adjust the connection, then it sometimes gets better. Once you get used to the under-the-ear piece, it's comfortable. I haven't tried using it with the computer yet."
1,"broke, no support","Initially I loved it, exactly what I wanted. But it quit working within a month. Then I found out the product was discontinued in 2008, so there is no support available for it."
1,"low audio volume, no dedicated answer/hang up button on cord",Pros:LightweightCaller could hear me wellMute button on the wireCons:low audio volume (even with maxed out volume on phone and on the cord control)No dedicated answer/hang up button on cord
1,Terrible voice quality,Bought this product to use with my new RAZR M phone. The sound was ok but nobody could hear me. Said my voice was extremely muddled as if the microphone was up against my mouth. Tried multiple positions for the microphone but no luck.
1,Not usable,"I`m not sure why but Amazon is sending this product out with a 2 inch USB adapter rather than the 6 foot USB connector cord that is in the product description, the headset is NOT USABLE without the USB cable because the primary cord that connects to the headset is only around 3 feet long so unless you like having to stick your head right up next to the USB port on your computer it won`t work . Another minus is that it is not compatible with my Xperia phone so for me it is 100% useless. I have purchased many products from Amazon with no problems but this issue of not including a critical part and necessary item needed to use this headset really annoys me and has lowered my opinion of them primarily because their giving a false description of the product , I was planning on using this at work and now I have to look for a whole new headset while returning this one , otherwise I know Plantronics makes good devices."
2,Won't function correctly with most Smart Phones,"I was really hoping that this would work well with my Motorola Rarz Maxx. I could hear the other person well, but others could barely understand me from their end. After much research at Plantronics, they said that this product will not function correctly with modern Smart Phones. Even though it has a 2.5 to 3.5 mm converter cord, the required voltage is not present with Smart Phones, whether they are iPhones, Droid OS, or other. They need USB voltage from a computer, for example. Call Plantronics and they will verify this. Plantronics is not making an appropriate 3.5 mm wired headset.I could not find a good quality Bluetooth headset until my recent purchase of the Plantronics Voyager Pro HD. It is not 100%, but amazingly good. It is available from Amazon."
3,OK for Price,"If you are looking for something at a descent price this is ok. It shorts out some after about 3 weeks of use. My biggest problem with this product is that the piece to adjust is not bendable, making it hard for the other caller to hear me.There is some static/echo sound sometimes.Otherwise it does ok. If you are looking for good quality do not recommend this!"
3,No instructions on setup,Works okay when you get it setup with your computer microphone hard to hear on other end at times. Cord could be longer as well...
4,Light weight,"I like this ear piece a lot, hardly now I have it on. Would have given five stars except it is easily pulled off of ear, needs to fit a little tighter."
1,Disappointing Volume Level,"I was really looking forward to this piece of equipment doubling as a hands-free solution for my cell as well as handling my VOIP needs. I can raise people just fine on my VOIP connection, but they are barely audible through the headset. I can actually hear a coworker 50 feet away from me better through the ear without the headset on than I can through the headset, even with the volume on both my laptop and the headset at 11.The conclusion at which I've arrived is that this was designed for people with bat-like hearing. So, unless you have bat-like hearing, save yourself the trouble of shipping it back and choose something else."
1,I bought because of reviews - mistake,"1. The cord is so short that you have to be very close to computer.2. The ear piece is simply awful, especially if you are a woman you need to keep a hand on it to keep it in your ear.3. After a few months use the sound got quieter and quieter than was gone. There is no support of any kind from the company or online.No sound means you end up tossing it out. Sadly a complete waste of money. But I did learn a lesson, always check the negative reviews first."
2,Three in one - but not cell phones,"The jack is 2.5mm, not 3.5mm which fits in cell phone ... oh well, fairly comfortable and good for computer use, but as landlines are virtually non-existent, not so multifunctional for cell phone only users."
3,Does not work with Droid X without extra parts,"I wanted a corded headset. This was stocked by Amazon and had good reviews. One review sent me down the wrong path: 'Comes with 2.5mm for phones and works with 3.5mm computers via USB'. Well, OK, true. That's a neat feature. But, I guess smartphones are also 3.5mm adapters.So, I got it and sighed as I realized I have a 3.5mm adapter on my Droid. I tried to buy the adapter but they are all $8 or more and every one of them seems to have a review saying they have issues.Overall -- I think the product looks nice and it would probably be a nice headset. But, I'm going to try to find one that includes the 3.5 or comes standard with it."
2,"Poor sound qualities, especially for the person you are calling.","This headset sounded terrible to the people we called. A much less expensive, older headset we owned was superior, so we returned this product."
2,Not for me!,"I do not like the Plantronics Mx500i headset that I purchased from Amazon. I had hoped to use it to receive Voice over internet, allowing me to receive calls through my laptop where ever I chose. I can not keep the headset in my ear. It pinches and then falls out.I will be returning this to Amazon and trying a different type."
2,Uncomfortable but cheap. You get what you pay for!,"The 'over-the-ear' fit is not the most comfortable, but for non-wireless earphone jack, this is a good buy for the money. It's the second one I've owned and one must be very careful when removing from the jack port on the phone. Apparently I've drug my phone and all off the desk and/or counter too many times and the wires became disconnected within the headset itself, requiring the need to purchase another. Easily transfers from right to left ear depending on the user's preference. If I would have had the money, I would not have purchased this again. But, again...not bad for the price."
4,Good little headset,I have only been using the headset on and off for about a week. So far it is very comfortable and I like the under the ear design. Most of the time I forget that it's sitting there. The sound quality is very good and I haven't had anyone on the other end of the phone complain about the quality either. There is also an inline volume adjustment and mute button. This is useful so I can lower the volume of the headset only without having to lower the overall volume on the phone.I haven't tried the USB attachment for use with computer-based calls but I like that I have it in case I want to use it in the future.
3,Not what I wanted,I returned this item. The description for this item did NOT specifically say it would not work with a land line phone (like an office phone).
1,Most Uncomfortable Headset I Have Ever Tried,"Truly the most uncomfortable, inconvenient, difficult to put on, headset. If I hadn't paid $30 for it, I would have tossed it in the trash. I have to literally hold it up to my ear to hear since it's so difficult to get on. If you wear earrings, forget it."
2,dont care for it,"dont like it. got for home, using skype phone service. a hassle to put on. never feels right"
1,Not compatible with Linux,My requirements were the following:1. Skype compatiable2. Laptop compatible - Dell Precision M653. Linux compatible - Fedora Core 74. Small and compact - laptop bag storageThe product did not meet my requirements. The Under-the-ear was novel but awkward. The 10 foot cord was way too long.
5,Excellent!,I got this headset to use for WoW and couldn't be happier! Earpiece is extremely comfortable with great sound quality (for me and the talkee) for such a low cost. Would recommend to anyone looking for a headset for use with their computer.
1,So-So Headset,"I purchased two of these headsets, the first one broke. It seams a bit fragile. The second one just stopped working properly. People on the line cannot hear me. I adjusted the mic and volume, to no avail. I am looking for a different brand."
1,Did not match product details,"Product description included ""Headset cord length 46 inch (3ft 10?), USB Dongle cord length 78 inch (6ft 6?), Total combined cord length for use on PC = 10ft 4 inch"" but there was no USB dongle cord, so the total length was 3ft 10in. Because I planned to use this for my computer, this is completely unacceptable. The cord won't reach from the computer to my ear."
1,Terrible Product,"I purchased this product a month ago. Seemed ok at first but within a week, the microphone would cut in and out so I am making/taking calls and the person on the other end cannot hear me. To fix this, I would have to remove it from the USB port and insert again. Also, just this week, the ear piece broke in half. What a piece of garbage. Would not recommend buying this product."
1,Wanted to like it but mic is weak,"I have been searching for a reasonably priced headset with an effective microphone for my LG P990. I was hopeful with Plantronics name and the generally positive reviews. However, I was disappointed in the primary function that I was seeking, that is, the microphone. It may work for some folks but for me the boom mic was only effective when I took the headset off and put it right up to my mouth. So I wasted my money. I am still haven't found what I'm looking for..."
3,"great, but fragile","When it works, it works great. It's comfortable, and sound quality is excellent. But it's fragile. I have broken the stem on the ear ""plug"" and replaced the headphone twice now. I guess it's good enough to keep replacing it?"
1,Stopped working after 3 months,Was using this to communicate through Skype and PC games. Worked great for 3 months then just stopped working. The thing never left my desk so there was no physical damage to cause this.
3,Mixed results,I recently bought two Plantronics MX5001 3-in-1 headsets--one for my daughter and one for me. Turns out that the one I kept works fine but there is something wrong with the plug on my daughter's set. She gave it back to me for return. The one that we kept works as advertised; sound quality is crisp and clear and the set is comfortable to wear. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I4RMOU/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
1,"tried 2, nether one worked","I used a plantronics headset at work similar to this and wore it all day with no discomfort, so when it came time to need something for home I felt comfortable buying this product.The 1st one I got didn't work, I spent time on the phone with they're tech support and was told that I must have a bad one and to return it for another. I waited for unit #2 and when I had it set up I encountered a different problem with that unit. I called their tech support again and again they came to the conclusion that there was something wrong with the unit. I went back to my old bulky headset for the time being.2 different units2 different problems2 returns0 satisfactionthe only good part of the whole thing was dealing with Amazon!!! They made the whole experience of returning, replacement and refund bearable and problem free."
5,Headset perfection attained,"Only trick was learning how to install into my ear, but once there it stays there, doesn't get tangled in my hair, and includes all the right adapters. And it sounds great."
2,Too small,I am not too enamored of this item. Compared to my previous headset this headset has a very short wire (probably around 45 inches). This means you will be tied to your pc and will not be able to move very far.The volume is the worst. It is very low and sometimes I have to hold and press the speaker in my ear in order to hear anything. I would not recommend this item.
5,"After 5 years, I still prefer this model","When it comes to headsets for phones, the winds of change blow like a hurricane. I started using this model when it first came out, largely because it was made by Plantronics. I instantly fell in love with it! My favorite feature is that it works on my house phone, my office-in-home phone, my iPhone, and especially my computer for Skype and GoToMeeting calls. I don't like Blue-tooth prices or my tendency to leaving an expensive Blue-tooth device on a table in a restaurant, or in the car, or at home, or... The MX500i is a wired device that doesn't suffer from interference, and it's cheap enough to but one for every location (car, office, home). The price has dropped significantly since I bought my first unit, and it works just as well today as it did then. I've purchased this model for my friends and family as gifts, because it's easy to install and works great with Skype and GoToMeeting!"
2,"Fits horribly, sounds good.","After figuring out how to attach it to my ear I quickly realized that it didn't stay in place at all. The heavy mic control piece doesn't help either...it only contributes to weighing it down from one's ear.The usb dongle is begging to break with such a short cable tethered from my laptop to my head.If you can get past the design, the sound quality has been fine so far.I will be looking elsewhere."
1,Poor Mic - Broke in 2 Weeks,People had a hard time hearing me. That is until two weeks later when it broke completely. Three More Words
1,Worst ear fit ever,"I have no idea who's ear this would fit. It takes me a long time to get it to stay and it fits lousy. With all the good fits out there, not sure what this one is all about. I've already stopped using it."
3,Headset,Doesn't work with our data phones like it said. Maybe it's on my end. Sounds/microphone are great. Like the style so that it doesn't press on your glasses. I will be returning it because the USB/phone compatibility.
5,Best headset for more than one world,I can use this headset on my laptop or my phone. took a bit to figure out how to adjust mic and ear piece but overall nice headset. I use for conference calls on laptop all the time
4,Just what I wanted,"I prefer a wired headest to wireless. Have never had good results with wireless headsets. I also wanted a product that I could use on my home phone and with the computer for web cam. Most headsets either have the 2.5mm connector for phone or 3.5mm for computer. The Plantronics MX500i has a 2.5mm and adapts to USB for the computer.Best of all, the sound quality is very good. People that I have called say it sounds excellent with little echo or background noise."
2,Extremely disappointing,"Not as advertised. Cable barely 3 feet at best. Microphone quality poor to horrible, callers on other end heard constant reverberation and a tin like sound on their end. Ended up returning and will look at other models."
4,"comfortable, discreet","It is very light weight, which really helps. I can wear it during the day, even when I'm not on a call. it is also fairly easy to get it on and off if you don't want to do that. I like the mute/volume control on the headset itself too. My only 'complaint' is that it could be louder. Sometimes where I sit, I could use some extra volume."
1,Uncomfortable and cheaply made,This Headset is not only uncomfortable but the speaker part broke after only a month of use. I did like the sound quality but it was not worth the discomfort and poorly made design. This product is very disappointing considering the quality name brand. I recommend opting for the Plantronics M220C Mobile Headset instead.
5,Excellent,Its a beauty. A sleek multi-function device that comes handy any time. Mostly used as a backup headset to my bluetooth.
5,Great headset!!!,"Ive been using this for about 3-4 weeks now and its has great sound quality, great mic, very comfortable, and versatile because of the different connection options.Id definitely suggest this to anyone."
3,"You hear them good, but they say your voice is very soft","I bought this item based on good reviews, and ignored the view bad ones. I thought it was great until people on business calls start noting to me that my voice sounds so soft - I plug the headset, and I am fine.So, I was not impressed by the repeated feedback of soft voice and I had to either hold the mic to my mouth or unplug."
2,Talking from a tin can,"I've been using this headset about a month now, I've tried different drivers, audio amplifiers, adjusting the line volume, etc, and the feedback I get from everyone I talk to is that I sound as if I'm talking into a tin can. Pretty frustrating since it wasn't super cheap."
2,Doesn't stay in the ear,It doesn't stay in my ear. So I had to send this item back to Amazon. I waisted my time.
3,Microphoneboom breaks easily,"Comes with a 2.5mm plug. You will need an adapter to use with iPhone or most Android phones which require a 3.5mm plug. The ear piece is very comfortable and is easily adjusted for left or right ear. The boom microphone also has a nice ""swivel"" adjustment feature. The boom is just a hollow plastic tube, it is not a wired mic. The boom has broken twice in my case. You can repair it easily by fusing the pieces back together with high strength transparent tape. Of course this patch it together approach is of limited sustainability. I am quite gentle with all my electronic equipment so I am surprised at the breakage I experience. Otherwise the overall star rating would be 4 or 5."
3,Disappointing,"I bought this headset based on positive reviews of good voice quality. Unfortunately I have often had people tell me that they can't hear when using the headset, but they can when I unplug it. I wanted a wired unit because I believed that the sound quality would be better than a wireless one, but this unit does not deliver. It is also a little difficult to put on, making it hard to answer calls before they get sent to voicemail."
3,Uncomfortable for Big Ears,"I have used this product for about a couple of days, and unfortunately it's too uncomfortable to wear for an extended period of time. I have particularly big ears, and since the headset is mostly hard plastic, it digs in the inner ear hole. After a 1 hour phone conversation, my ear did not feel good. I did read the instructions and fitted the ear piece properly.From a sound quality perspective, I could hear conversations very well. I also asked folks that I had phone calls with how they heard me and they said ""fine"". This is much better than the cheap headset I had in the past where people said I sounded faint. The mic boom is adjustable and doesn't get in the way. Also the controls are pretty intuitive.It's too bad, because this seemed like a winner to me based on the reviews."
3,Works well -hard to get to stay on ear,"This works well if you can get it to stay on your ear. Had some problems getting the ear tip to sit in my ear, it is almost too big for my ear."
3,Loved the Headset--Did Not come with the long cord.,"The headset it great, comfortable, easy on and off. The only complaint is that the description said there was a 6 ft + cord, but after two attempts to get that I gave up. Now I'm shopping for the longer cord and until I find it, I'm stuck not being able to even stand up."
1,Static using with Iphone 4,I had a previous version of the MX500I. It worked great but the wires split at the audio connector. I hear static with the new headset.
1,only a 3 foot cord?,"I was surprised that the length of the cord (that plugs into a phone) is only 3 feet long, which makes it virtually unusable for a desk phone without purchasing an extension cable, which cost me an additional $10. I got a lot of complaints that people couldn't hear me, and it hurt to wear more than a couple of hours at a time. I've had dozens of headsets over the last 20 years, this is the first set that I didn't like."
4,Great Headset,"This is a great headset for anyone wanting a hands free option. I personally use it with Skype and it works/sounds very clear. It's nice and light so you almost forget its in your ear. Plus for the price, you really are getting a great deal and quality product."
2,Plastic Mic boom snapped,"I admit I am usually pretty tough on equipment because I travel alot, but I pulled this headset out of my bag one day and the plastic tube had snapped at the mic. It generally worked ok, although sometimes I would have trouble hearing at max level and found myself having to get on the computer setting and maximize the volume as well. I bought this because it was compact, but not sure I will replace with same product."
3,decent headset,I have been using this headset A LOT and can say it is quite comfortable to wear around the house daily for long periods of time. The mute switch is a push button that goes back and forth with a click. It is currently feeling like it is about to break so I have stopped using it.
5,I don't use this product as intended.,"I used this headset as a replacement for my many broken headsets from Microsoft for use on my Xbox 360, the sound clarity is far superior to most headsets I've used in the past, the microphone swivels to either direction allowing for easy use on either ear, the sound tube design allows for fantastic backround cancellation while keeping voice quality high, which is especially important if you intend to use this product for gaming, this headset doesn't pick up unwanted noise even when using a close placed surround system."
4,Quite good for what it is...,"I say quite good ""for what it is"" because I am used to wearing a headset and having sound come into both ears, which I prefer.But I got this unit for the low profile, for when I do video classes.I gave a four star ranking and would need to try other units from other makers before I could say just how good this one is.The fit is ""unusual"" but good, and I think for a first time user it takes a while to get used to.But yes, overall glad I got this unit, since it is priced really well for what you get."
2,Would not buy again,"Used this headset off & on for 5-months, not stellar in my experience.It's built sturdy enough, but is uncomfortable after 20-30mins and sound quality is minimal due to the funky fit of the earpiece into the ear.I don't recommend this one to friends."
3,used to be 5 star.... new packaging doesnt match description,"I bought this back in 2009.... when""Headset cord length 46 inch (3ft 10?),USB Dongle cord length 78 inch (6ft 6?),Total combined cord length for use on PC = 10ft 4 inch""_Was_ all true. I just bought a replacement.. if I didnt already have the USB dongle, I would be screwed as the new packaging replaces the usb dongle with a usb plugin with NO cord length... This would not have worked for me -- thankfully I am ok, but, this would have been a returned product if I couldnt reuse the cord that came with the unit back in 2009... very sad"
2,BEWARE of crappy USB adapter!,"The headset is decent with good sound and voice, tried it with iPhone recording and the results were good. Also it fits comfortably unlike other headset that hang around the earlobe. But BEWARE of the chances getting a defective USB adapter! The thing is poorly made with crappy sounds and must constantly adjust the 2.5mm plug to make either sound or mic to go through the adapter. (Or maybe im just unlucky to get the crappy USB stick :\). The alternative way to work on PC is to get a headset to PC dual adapter/separator plug into PC as analog inputs, or in my case, an XBOX 360 controller (it works!)Recommend to those who use this without the USB adapter. i give 2 stars just because of the USB adapter quality. overall the headset is good for 4 star."
1,Are we reviewing the same item?,"Because I couldn't get this thing to fit my ear. Even when seated properly, the slightest movement causes the earpiece to dislodge from the ear, the rubber support to droop, and the boom to fly outward. I then had to gently wrestle this contraption back into place only to have it happen again moments later. The earpiece isn't even shaped properly. I felt as though I was trying to shove a golf ball in my ear. I didn't even get a chance to test the sound quality becasue I couldn't keep it on. Maybe my ears are just too weird for the average human, but this thing was a total loss for me."
3,"Eh.. It's alright, better for some.","I wanted to use this headset for gaming but it didn't really work too great for me. First of all, for some reason it only fit good in my left ear, not my right (which I like to use). This is probably a problem with my ear shape(lol) and also, it wasn't something you could easily take on and off quickly. It felt like it was loose and the shape of the ear bud was awkward. The sound quality was good but not great, but would have been acceptable for my needs. I did like the volume control and mute feature though. Overall, I can see the quality in the product but it just wasn't for me so I decided to return it and go back to an over the head headset."
2,Won't work w/ Droid X or iPhone,It would have been so much simpler if they had just listed the phones that are compatible. It won't work with a Droid X or an iphone so I think it's pretty limited.
2,Noisy,"A real disappointment, not up to Plantronics' usually-impeccable standards. The unfiltered mic picks up lots of extraneous noise, such as air conditioner hum, background music and nearby conversations. Callers complain of ""tunnel"" sound. Putting it on takes practice. It is comfortable to wear, but that's irrelevant if it's unpleasant and distracting to use."
3,"Not what I thought, but it's OK","I expected this to be awesome all around because of Plantronics. It's difficult hearing through the earpiece. Since I am just starting out, I will make it work but this can't be used for too long without getting frustrated."
2,uncomfortable and ill-fitting,"I returned this earpiece / headset because it didn't suit me. It was difficult to install in the ear to begin with, did not feel secure once fitted, and the hard plastic in-ear speaker was uncomfortable.Also, for my work environment (truck driver) the speaker volume was insufficient. The only positive thing I can say is that the boom microphone seemed to work well,because people could hear my voice well. Overall, if used in more quiet surroundings, and if the earpiece fit your particular anatomy, this may be a good choice, but it didn't work for me.PS, I think an over ear design would feel more secure. Because this device fits from below the ear, it just didn't feel like it would stay in place well."
4,Hanson is a cool band. So where do you find the good books?,"Hanson is one of the coolest bands and you can find really good books on them. The one book I found that tells ALL the behind the scences stuff and info. about Hanson and the GIRL TOPIC is Dancin' with Hanson by Ravi. In the book you find out how a lot of back up musicians left Hanson to join other bands that they thought would go futher. They were wrong though!!! Also you find out that the title isn't some corny line but the ""Dancin'""part means changing their scheduale sometimes only hours or minutes before the actual show! So if you have read all the other Hanson books like I have and are dieing for some TRUE and DEEP info. on the boys get Dancin' with Hanson!!!!! I definatly give that book a 5!!!!"
3,An almost complete book set,"I have read this set of books. It is a good collection to start one off on getting to know Hanson. Although some facts are fake, and some of the text is repeatitive. Overall it is a good beginning for a new Hanson Fan!"
5,Hanson Book,"I Love Hanson esp. Zac , but the book had so many wrong facts in it but as long as it's 'bout Hanson I'll still give it 5 stars ! ~ Samantha a.k.a. MMMSparkel@aol.com"
2,It had too much false information and old information.,"I have met Hanson and alot of the stuff about their personalities were incorrect! Maybe that was just your perspective on them! Alot of the info. was old or totally untrue. If you're going to write a book on Hanson please do better, more accurate research."
4,Boxed Up Fun,"This set of books on the Hanson brothers is a good buy, you save some extra money. The only problem once again is that some of the info is untre!!"
3,Don't Order From VitaminLife,"I ordered this item through VitaminLife with plenty of time until Christmas. They just notified me 3 days before Christmas that they were cancelling my order because it was ""out of stock."" I placed the order a week and a half ago and they just notified me, so I can't order a replacement before Christmas. This looked like a good product; just don't order it from the VitaminLife vendor."
4,Soft hands :),"This is a good product! Love the lotions, and I especially love the gloves! The only thing I'm not happy with is the don't send the banana hand cream...it's an almond hand cream, which doesn't smell that great. I ordered 2 of these and they both came with the almond. But that's the only issue I have with it!"
3,A bit different than expected,"I have used this kit in the past and I love the products included. I especially like the cuticle cream and banana hand cream. However, the kit I received did not come with the banana cream, instead it came with the almond milk hand cream. A little disappointed, but all in all, a good product."
3,I do not love the smell,"I bought this for my really dry hands, and it is a nice concept, but not for me. The main objections are that the gloves shrank to child size after washing (and they needed to be washed after the first use), and the almond milk beeswax hand creme was too ""waxy"" and left a lot of residue, but once absorbed still smelled offensive to me. I would not say this didn't work, because I didn't use it long enough. I just hated the scent."
4,Great kit,"This is a very nice Kit. Every cream or lotion smelled great. The item arrived on time and packaged well. My only complaint was that in the picture shown online, the gloves looked like they had little bees on them. However, the gloves I received were just plan yellow. I know this is a small complaint but I just wish the description was more accurate. Overall, I would recommend this item and seller."
3,Mine came with Almond Milk instead of Banana Hand Creme,"And that's not terrible, but Amazon really needs to update their product listing to indicate that it may come with either one.Otherwise, I like this kit, have purchased it in the past, and probably will again sometime in the future. The gloves are super nice (love the bee design on them!), the shea butter hand creme is great and very effective for damaged skin (I know some people don't like the smell of this creme, but I'm not one of them!), the hand lotion is very nice, and probably the cuticle cream is too (I rarely use it)."
5,De Facto Standard,"I've been reading Steven Kent's articles in Next Generation magazine for a few years, patiently waiting for his book to come out. As soon as it was released, I purchased it and read it the next weekend. All I can say is I enjoyed the interviews, articles and historical information so much it inspired me to write a paper on the history of video game heroes for my Business Communications course! Good work!"
4,Enjoyable Book,This could be the most comprehensive book about the video game industry I have ever seen. It was very informative and enjoyable. The only reason that I would rate this book as four stars is because of the few typos I found in it.
4,"Great Book, Some Errors, But Nonetheless A Great Read","Steven Kent definitely knows his way around the video game industry. You will be baffled on how much interviews are put in the book. I think about 1/3 of the book are from interviews. Nonetheless it is great, the only flaw you could find from this book is that there are a few misspelled words and text format errors. Other than that, the only flaw I wish they would fix was extend the book to at least 1000 pages because the 494 pages of the gaming industry is really not enought to explain what happened throughout the whole industry."
4,Very nicely done history of video games.,"This is a well researched book on the history of video games, starting from its roots. It is full, and I mean FULL, of anecdotes from the people who were there. The author does a good job of clarifying and expanding upon those stories.I have a few quibbles: In the early '80s the author goes into great detail about Atari and even Coleco but doesn't cover Mattel's contribution enough. And later the Nintendo Game Boy is covered appropriately but the Sega Game Gear is hardly mentioned. There are also some minor formatting errors but my biggest gripe and the reason for 4 rather than 5 stars is the lack of an index. I don't think I've ever seen a nonfiction title like this one without an index. Want to find out who programmed Pac-Man? It's in the book but you won't find it easily. Still, I really enjoyed reading it."
5,The Ultimate Video Game History Book,"Stories have been floating around the video game business for years about Steven Kent's book on the history of video gaming. Now it's out, and it's everything I had hoped for.Kent's book does more than just cover that dates and events in the history of the video game business. He brings to life the colorful characters who built it. He also let's his subjects tell their stories in their own words.I've been in this business for over a decade, and can attest to the fact that Steven really captures his subject well. I even learned things for the first time about companies where I worked for years!"
5,A Wonderful Read!,"I love these books! Okay, the guy is quite the rake-hell--not your standard hero. That's part of the charm. He is self-serving but decent. He's beset with all kinds of difficulties and has an uncanny knack for turning trouble into luck. His character flaws make him all the more believable and engaging. Lewry's reflections are a hoot. Lambdin's nautical information and sailing descriptions are to my mind, peerless in the nautical adventure series world. Lambdin does his homework.The series is a most unpretentious romp, full of great information on the era and nautical information. I look forward to the next installment!"
4,Sea of Grey,SEA of GREY.......Very much like the sea.... Lots of waiting them quick to action that is over quickly . Follows history well AKearns
3,"Entertaining, but there are better","I'm writing a review of this particular novel in the series because it's the one that helped me break my habit. Alan Lewrie is an entertaining character, and the battles and love-making are fun, and the books are fairly well-written. The early ones do make a habit of ending long, long sentences with exclamation marks, in a failed attempt at adding some tension. But, otherwise, Lambdin has some pretty good prose. The books are riddled with anachronisms, such as having Lewrie playing ""Down by the Sally Gardens"" a hundred years before Yeats wrote it. Basically there are downmarket versions of C.S. Forester or Patrick O'Brian. They're fun, but not particularly though-provoking. After awhile, they get a bit predictable, Lewrie alienates someone, gives us a pornographic sex scene or two, and then blunders into good fortune. Fair enough. But Forester and O'Brian are better, a bit smarter and a bit more rewarding."
2,A great series headed south?,"I really enjoyed all the previous novels about our once roguish hero, but he seems to have become middle aged and more concerned with the problems in his marriage than our former rake who had an eye for the ladies, boring. Like one of the other reviewers I found myself just skimmimg pages, something I seldom do, and never before in this series.I hope this is just a passing phase of Captain Lewrie's life and Mister Lambdin's writing, and that the next chapter finds Lewrie engaging once again in page turning period adventure."
3,Good fodder till the next Nelson novel.,"I am in some agreement with the fellow who wrote that you needed to read the earlier books in this series to understand everything that was going on because I didn't. . . and I didn't. That said, I still enjoyed this pretty good actioner, though I think there have probably been enough British naval heros in contemporary literature. This one has the distinction of being more of a rogue than some, so he's interesting in a Flashman sort of way. I guess as an American I'm pretty fond of James L. Nelson, whose Isaac Biddlecomb is the quintessential reluctant warrior/Yankee capitalist and whose stories celebrate a Navy other than the British Royal (and underdogs to boot). This was a good fast read, but just cannon fodder till the next Nelson book is out. I will definitely go back, though, and read the rest of this series."
2,"Good Reading, Dull Recipes","The book's title led me to think I would be buying a treasure-trove of fabulous recipes. Instead, I found it a helpful resource for understanding Chinese ingredients. I tried several different recipes, and they were equally flavorless and boring. It seems that neary every recipe is flavored with tiny amounts of soy sauce and sherry, and the end result required trying to add ingredients to step up the flavor. I am going back to the other Chinese cookbooks I have come to rely on. Funny as it sounds, every recipe I have used in my Betty Crocker Chinese cookbook has been superb, and it remains my source for delicious recipes and flavor combinations. This disappointing book will stay on the shelf as an informational resource only."
3,Somewhat Helpful and Interesting,"Like many other readers, I was drawn to this book by it's sheer number of receipes- one thousand- wow! Sadly, it did not live up to my expectations. 'Cook until just done' is not a sufficient explanation on how to stir-fry vegetables. Many of the recipes are quite similar, for example, fish balls, the various stir-fries, and many others. I appreciated the explanations of the highlights of regional cuisines and cooking styles, but found such information far to brief and woefully lacking in detail. I was annoyed that the recipes were not labeled with their region of origin."
1,One big meh,"I think this book was exciting and yummy in the era it was written.Now that widespread Asian grocery stores have put authentic ingredients at or fingertips this book leaves me realizing that the all you can eat Chinese buffet in Fargo, ND wasn't that bad"
5,Essential for Chinese cooking!,"If it isn't in this book, you don't want to cook it anyway! This is the essential book if you want delicious Chinese food. Easy to read, easy to follow. She explains everything so clearly that I had no trouble following any of the recipes. This one's a must on your cookbook shelf!"
2,Not very usefull,"This book is a little overwhelming and a little underwhelming at the same time. Unless you seriously want to really dive in and spend all your cooking time learning Chineese cooking, the 1000 recipies are simply just far too many. It was difficult to decide which recipies to try as often there are a dozen that are essentially all the same with one ingredient different. In the end, the ones I did pick were not bad but also not particulary exciting or interesting."
1,P/O'ed,"I have waited until I cooled off before answering this. I ordered this bit to replace a damaged bit in my old set of Irwin bits.What I got insted was a piece of crap!!! It is not a good old American Irwin bit, like the bits in my set. But rather a bit made for Irwin in BRAZIL, and apparently without any specifications or ""QUALITY"" control. The bit was not only machined poorly (tool and foundry marks) but the black foundry slag was still on the lead screw, cutting head and spurs. To that add a big 1/4"" flat spot ground on the outside face of one of the spurs. I blame Irwin for going un-American, like other greedy so called American tool makers; try Stanley or Nicholson to name a few. And I blame them for not keeping the standard of quality that was set by the American worker over 100 years ago.I would return this pice of junk, but the time and trouble in doing so ismore to me than the refund.Tom Fitz"
5,"""OH MY GOD!!!!""","Brent Locke's tunes are hot! He is an amazing performer in more ways than one. Yes girls, the rumor is true!!!! AD (Not Your Average Groupy!)"
1,AVOID THIS PRODUCT -- Total failure w/ XP,"AVOID THISThe drivers for this product were simply not perfected to work with Windows XP. After several phone conferences and several hours, and e-mailing me a ""special"" set of drivers, still the help tech was unable to get me up and functioning -- I sent it back.Aside -- The tech was clearly motivated (probably by his incentive system) to try to get me ""resolved"", and for several calls just didn't want to give up. But once hope was lost, his tone shifted instantly and he just wanted to close the discussion.I sent it back to the address it came from, but have NOT received a refund or any responde. I'm chalking it up to a ""lesson learned""."
5,An Apologetics Classic,"This is a magnificent update of an absolute classic. Dr Sheehan's ""Apologetics"" is a step-by-step argument for the truth of the Catholic religion - logical, succinct, reasonable, and dealing with every objection on the way. Convincing and informative."
5,Awesome Battery,"I have used Optima batteries for years in my cars, trucks and in my rock crawler and they are amazing. They out last everything else and the one I replaced this one with lasted for 7 years. I will never use anything else and Amazon did a great job getting it shipped very fast."
5,"Not the cheapest, just the best.","Just replaced this same battery after many years of service. Used solely for starting a large marine diesel engine that got irregular use. Battery was in the boat winter and summer for 13 years, but was charged monthly. Great product!"
4,OPTIMA batteries,"I have not seen any problem and when I start my SUV is like a breeze, no hesitation at all and very easy to install and replace my old battery."
4,Hard to get a seal,"The product worked as expected, except it was hard to get the adapter to seal around the master cylinder reservoir. The first problem was the plastic reservoir had bulged out on the sides, had to use a C-clamp to squeeze it back in. The second problem was the adapter wouldn't seal at the ends, the chain pull down system is a little lacking, but due to the slant design of the GM master, I don't see any other way. I used two more C-clamps at either end, and still had leakage. Made a big mess, but it did hold enough pressure to do the job. I gave four stars due to the adapter seal problem, but otherwise, it works well."
4,Split peas,What the hell do you expect on a package of split peas - there were no holes involved in the packaging!
5,Highly recommended for anyone undergoing changes.,"I am a psychotherapist and often recommend Bridges' book for my clients who are in the midist of painful transitions, such as relationship breakup, career change, ending something and uncertain about what's next, etc. The concept of an ""empty space"" between ending the old and beginning the new is especially helpful."
3,"Some wonderful information, but in a cloudy form","I found this book to be very helpful and insightful, but overly long and ponderous. Others may appreciate Bridges' style more than I, but I found myself frustrated by lots of repetition (Did you know that ancient and traditional cultures have rites of passage that mark transitions?), and wishing that it had been through some more thoughtful editing to clear away about one-third of the work, parts that more muddy the picture than sharpen or brighten it. Some great content, just too much extraneous and repetitious text."
4,helpful and thought provoking,Helpful in thinking about how to make changes in mid-life. Thought provoking and helpful as one tries to think of how to improve work and home.
3,Still slugging through it.,"Written originally for business situations,but now applied and recommended for all sorts of life's transitions. Still slugging through it. Wish I could have taken such an organized approach to my transition."
5,If going through a big life change read this book.,Information was far more than I expected and very well done so much so that I re-read it after I was done. Highly recommend.
1,Disappointing,"I've read many books on undergoing significant life changes and this one was the poorest. I was misled that his PhD was in psychology or another related area. It's probably in English or other. He refers to Alice in Wonderland, TS Eliot, Zen and others who aren't part of behavior science. Comforting? No. Enlightening? In an obtuse approach, other self help books are far better. His writing style is removed from the subject and doesn't really cover all that is involved in a life transition."
2,Another Self Help Book,I did have to buy this book for a class and I view it as a total waste. It is just another self help book...if you wish to stray away from the reality of life and have something to blame your problems on this is the book for you.
3,Read if you've been laid off,"This book offers an intellectual approach to the change process and isn't necessarily an easy read. However, I recommend it to individuals who have been laid off or are resistent to change being foisted upon them. I like how Bridges has identified transition in three phases: Endings, Neutral Zone and New Beginning. From my experience working with career changers, everyone must pass through a period of ""disorientation"" to reach ""reorientation"" in order to achieve personal growth. Bridges does a good job of explaining this process."
5,A classic,This is essential reading for anyone who works with people experiencing change. It transformed my understanding of transition and what it means.
5,Best Help for Job Changes,"Bill Bridges does a great job of helping folks though the major transitions in life - job changes, marriage/divorce/death, having a child. I've used this book as a foundation for helping people who are out of work deal with the uncertainty and feelings of loss so they are in a better position to find and get that new job. This is a gift book for all your friends who are facing a transition."
5,The Great One,"God how harold got the joint jumpin' at our house.It was the late 60's I was just 9 years old and loved to dance to his music.But as the years passed Harold seemed to drop out of sight.I thought he had passed away because the songs stopped coming.I'd love to know if this is so,if anyone can send an email to SaiFon1940@aol.com I'd appreciate it. My favorite album of Harold's is ""Out of sight and sound""I wish I was able to find it on c.d. Love Ya Harold!"
5,The girl's got lilt,"Lovely, lyrical poems that combine traditional techniques with a modern sensibility. Some haunting, some funny... all well-made."
5,Everyone will love this,There is no better poetry to make you feel good. The poems are scintillating with wit and musical sounds and new rhymes no one has ever used. The poems on the World Trade Center are the best. They rise above everything else written about that. Lots of poems about magical times all over the world too.
1,not at all,"Despite the fact that some great poets gave great blurbs to this debut collection of poetry, I found the poems to be very, very weak. I wouldn't read this book."
5,heartbreak highs music,Heart break high was one of the best series i have ever seen and the music from the first series was brilliant and is bought to you and has a good vibe i give it ten out of ten.The music if you watched the series really brings it all back.My favorite song was groovin and i also liked talk about love an excellent c.d compolation worth having.
2,The PC version reigns supreme,"I own the Rainbow 6 PC version and it's an excellent game. Unfortunatly, my computers graphics card, and speed is pure crap. My friend and I then decided to rent it to see how it compared to the PC version. The graphics were very good, and the speed was fast. But the game developers did a very sloppy job creating this game. They just dumped a bunch of levels in the game and all you do is run around, and solve very simple objectives. No storyline whatsoever! No John Brightling or Anne Lang and their evil plot. The sound wasn't half as good as the PC version, it just looped over and over. They had no bio-suits. Only 2 people to a team.You could not go out of 1st person veiw. The graphics were excellent and the speed was exceptional but the cool story that made me like the game in the first place was demolished. The game was just sloppy."
1,RainBlow Sucks...,"...This is by far the worst N64 game I have ever played...Graphics are horrible. Controls are clunky. Sounds are so-so. Dumb map stays onscreen and there is no feature to remove the navigational map which causes distractions. Low replay value, what replay value? I played for about 15 minutes and haven't picked it up since then.Keep your money and spend it on something else, save yourself from wasting your money and time on this game."
3,IT'S GREAT! For about five minutes.,This is a game that you think that you'll want to buy if you've played it for a couple minutes. But I returned it after two weeks and you will too. The graphics are ok. But the realality of the game isn't any better than golden eye. Sure one shot and your dead. But you can stand behind a guy for ten minutes and he won't notice you. And all you do is go around shooting a thousand people.
1,Not Much Challenge-Only 6hrs to finish everything on Elite.,"I was extremely disappointed. I expected a more challenging game based on reading all of the reviews. From reading the professional reviews, it became very clear that they were written based on either the instruction booklet (which talked about a lot of neat features that didn't come with the game) or a preview of the game, but not the actual game. I thoroughly enjoyed 007 and would love to see someone create a game in that genre that was better. This is not it.This one is just too easy even on the most difficult of levels. It only takes 30 minutes per mission to figure out a way to complete it. I completed the entire game on the most difficult level in only six hours. Even use non-use of the gadgets do not affect the game play. Hardly worth $45.00.I must say that the graphics are good, the concept is good, and even the game play has its good points. Its weaknesses out weigh any strength it may have."
1,What a let down,"I don't know what everyone is raving about. This game is such a let down. From the reviews I thought it would be good, some say better than Golden Eye, but this game doesn't come close.The controller is poorly configured, the graphics are poor, the whole thing sucks. Don't waste your money."
5,"The best yet, in n64 gaming","This game is the most awesome, most realistic game I have ever played. You are a really there, sneaking around trying to finish your mission without getting any of your men killed. It's best with two players, and you find yourself whispering to your partner during the game. Enjoy the game!"
4,Rainbow Six will be the best game of 1999,"I purchased this game from Amazon.com a little while ago and while I'm still waiting for it to arrive I can't believe they brought it to the 64. I have been waiting a year for this to come to consul and here it is. If you like Bond you probably will like this one... I have played it on computer and if you like realism you will like breaching a door, throwing a flashbang in side it, and running in with your HK-MP10 SD... I can't wait tell this game comes to me in the mail..."
4,THE BEST N64 GAME EVER!,"THE BEST GRAPHICS COMBINED WITH THE BEST SCENARIOS PLUS 1ST AND3RD PERSON, ALONG WITH TOM CLANCY'S GENIUS MAKE THIS GAME THEBEST! END"
5,One Of The Best Games Ever,"I just got the game for N64, it just happened to be sitting on the shelf. Anyway, I took it home and got started on it right away. From the beginning, the music draws you in. I could't stop playing it. I was so much fun, I couldn't put the controller down. The graphics are great, the idea of the game is great, overall the game is great. I suggest, you go out and buy it. Altough it probably won't be on the shelves anymore considering the fact that everyone wants to get their hands on it. My friend bought a N64 because he just wanted to have the game. I know that I am babbling but I just don't want you to miss out on a great game."
1,OVERLY HYPED...,"I read the reviews and researched the heck out of this game. The reviews on amazon made me jump at the game because most had given it a high rating. The game can't be found in stores because of how old it is, so I found it here at Amazon (Which I am greatful for Amazon because here you can, for the most part, order hard to find games).... BUT... the game controls are awful, the graphics bite (When moving your character, the foreground and background graphics move as well), there is a map that stays on screen the entire game and you can't get rid of it, story line is weak. The only thing that seemed to be somewhat fun was shooting and having to slowly move upon enemies, doors, etc. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone."
5,Rainbow Six for N64,"This game is really cool. First off if you don't have an expansion pak you will probably want to get one. It will help the graphics extremely and you'll want it for future games anyways. The graphics are better than Goldeneye if you have an expansion pak. It has a wide variety of playing options. Such as what assault weapon, sidearm, and whether you have grenades, more ammo and much much more in two boxes while planning. You can also chose what uniform to where as well as to how much body armor you wear. Over all this is the action game to get this year. I had trouble finding it but i did and i'm glad i bought it."
4,"Overall, a pretty good game","This game was pretty good, but it lacked highly in graphics and lenghth. The graphics are just a step up from duke nukem, which makes the game hard to get into. Also, there are only 12 levels, which really bites. The cooperative duo mode is excellent, but makes the game seem even shorter. A friend and I beat the whole game easily in 4 hours. The good thing is that you can choose your own equiptment and clothing for each mission, which is fun. The game is very realistic as well. Another bad thing is that you can barely hear it when your guns fire, resulting in frequent reloadings, which is annoying. It is a fun game, though, i must admit. Rent it before you buy."
2,don't recommend for people wanting loud bass,"These speakers are visually nice and work very well at low volume. if your looking for something to throw some real power and volume at try another brand. also the construction is not of high quality, my voice coil cover fell off one of them and they both blew aat fairly low leverls... using the recommended infinity amp... kind of dissapointed with the newer infinity products."
3,Get the update,"The 2012 update to Aurra Sing is a lot better, with loads of articulation and a much more accurate paint job. Get that one instead."
3,Regular,"This figure is good -- your regular Star Wars figure, not too much detail, an okay pose, not too manyy accessories, looks fantastic hosted by other Star Wars figure.This girl is a great buy after some other figures have been bought to crowd your desk, bench, or cabinet."
4,Super Silly Fun!,"My daughter loves this DVD. Even though it contains most of the episodes she's already seen on TV, it still seems to hold her interest because she is such a big Dora fan. The opening menu is pretty annoying because there are 2 menus to get through (or WAIT through) before it actually begins playing. But if you wait long enough you don't even have to use your remote (which is a lifesaver when your toddler wants to watch it NOW and you are busy!). I hope they come out with more Dora DVDs for our collection!"
5,Another Good Dora DVD,"This is one of the Dora DVD's Kiersten got for a birthday present in September.She seems to like it,especially the episode with the trucks.She likes to interact with the tape(pointing out the various objects,Doing the Swiper,No Swiping.etc)We have seen all these episodes on the Dora TV show,but she doesn't seem to mind watching them again."
3,Not Farrah's best.,"I bought this because i remembered seeing the first hollywood wives and i loved it, I also love Farrah so i assumed this would be good as well.I have to say i was disapointed, the acting wasen't very good and the story line could have been better."
2,What was this book about?,"What was this book about?Oh yes, memory. How it works, why it doesn't work, and perhaps how to have mine work better - at least that was my plan. The book is definitely entertaining, and it added to my growing storehouse of amateur cognitive science facts. But it did not do the job I intended for it. I know little more about how to remember more than I did previously. I do understand more about why I forget, and why a few of the mnemonist tricks I know work at all, but that didn't make it quite worth the read."
4,Fascinating and understandable,"Note to all, this is not a self-help book. People ask me that when they spot me reading it on the bus. It's a layman's (sensa spoonfeeding) explanation of how the mind stores memories, and more importantly, how it fails to. I'm just fascinated by the book. It touches on the everyday frustration of lost keys, the way memories pale over time, tip-of-the-tongue blocking, how we manufacture memories that couldn't possibly be true, and more. Lucidly written, Daniel Schacter's book reawakens in me a sense of awe for the power and delicacy of the workings of the human mind. A good read for anyone with an interest in psychology without the desire to get terribly clinical."
4,the problem with working memory,"Schacter explains early in this book the discovery of what working memory is for. That is, working memory has emergered in order to relate new knowldge to old knowledge. This function has been essential in learning words in humans.The problem with working memory is that people use working memory for tasks other than its original function. People use working memory in mathematics and logic and philosophy and science without being systematic. And then working memory misleads instead of leads.One needs a system of philosophy which is grounded in physical reality to make certain that new knowledge is related to knowledge of reality instead of a poor facsimile of it.The best system of philosophy for ensuring a proper and effective use of working memory is that system formulated by Mario Bunge."
4,explanation of memory,The author describes how memory works and why we fail to recall things at times. A great chapter is the one that details how incidents that never happened are explained years afterwards by people who thought that they had happened after the incidents were spoken about enough times. A very detailed book that is easy to read.
4,Interesting read,This is a pretty good book about how the human memory is both incredible and faulty at the same time. It's a really interesting read for anyone interested in how the memory works and the effect it has on our lives and society.
4,"Awesome, But Painful =)","Maybe it's just me, I'm more of a fiction book type of reader, tale of two cities, the great gatsby, hunger games, etc.Happen to be attending a physchology class at the same time (unintentional). I find this to be informative, yet slow, I hate to say a book is hard to read, but ultimately some are (the great gatsby as an example started off slow for me) ~ yet very enjoyable after the initial bumpBut I have a couple of books similar to this and they hold my interest, so I have to say I don't really enjoy this author.I would recommend it, but, be careful because there's no promise an unknown author can hold your attention"
5,Re-release this movie!! Make it affordable!!,"This timeless cult classic movie with a starstudded cast that includes Cliff Robertson,Buddy Ebsen,Anne Helm,Telly Savalas and many others is probably the greatest Doctor/Hospital movie ever especially concerning the trials and tribulations of being an intern in both the Doctor and Nursing profession.It's a fun,must see film that should be re-released on vhs/dvd so that humble people like myself can afford it!!"
3,see below,"The plot too thin, but a good cast, helped save it! I have nothing more to say and frankly, don't appreciate being forced to!!"
3,"good picture quality, bad sound","This was our first LCD TV purchase and we were impressed with the picture quality of this unit. It was very bright and clear picture especially with the pixel-plus features. But the sound quality coming out of the built-in speakers is horrible. I thought the unit was defective when I heard some high pitched nose. If you are looking for good quality pictures and don't care too much about the built-in speakers, then this might be the TV for you."
3,Early Christianity,"The classic work on Christianity's roots in ritualistic paganism. Not for the faint of heart or the easily offended, this book details ceremonies such as 'the holy kiss' in celebration of the eucharist. Fine black and white plates are suitable for framing."
4,classic family sitcom: learning and hugging,"""Keeping Up with the Kardashians: Season 3"" follows the classic family sitcom formula of learning and hugging, and does it quite well. Each episode has a main story where at least one family member has a problem, but by the end they've learned an important lesson and get a hug. Each episode also has a lighter and humorous secondary story. The episodes are surprisingly well constructed and entertaining. The Kardashians are flawed but very likable, and adult sisters Kim and Kourtney are very sexy. Reviewed 5/27/2009 after watching the entire season during its original broadcast."
1,ONly disc one included,There were two disc ones and no disc two!!!! UH what happened! I would like the second disc please!
1,About this book....,"This book was EXTREMELY boring. I only read it because it was assigned reading. It is kind of like a ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" but with 3 pages of physology inbetween each story."
2,Not quite what I expected.,"My sister has the Japanese learning kit from this product and she learned so much, so I bought the 102 language kit from the SAME product and it did NOT have all things that my sister has!! Mine does not the colors, alphabet and all the thing you need to learn a language. >:("
2,Not for the serious fisherman,"I found this book in an overstock store in an outlet mall. I know why it was an overstock. While I agree this is a light-hearted approach to fishing, it's ONLY that. Anyone looking for serious fishing tips and techniques needs to look elsewhere. The author attempts to describe various attributes of 20 different fish, and the ineptitude is almost comical. This may be a decent book if you've never picked up a pole before, but a serious fisherperson wouldn't benefit at all."
2,No thanks,"I discovered The Doors three years ago and have been listening ever since. Yesterday I purchased Morrison Hotel, and I was disappointed. Yes, Roadhouse Blues is a gem, as is Peace Frog and maybe Waiting for the Sun. But the rest of the album is really uninspiring. The lyrics aren't as deep as Strange Days and the instrumentals aren't as good/catchy as their debut album. It feels as though this album was created by four guys who ran out of ideas. An album created out of contractual obligation rather than creative drive. If you already have Roadhouse Blues on another compilation purchase LA Women. THAT'S a good album. One of their best."
3,Has defect been removed?,"Has anyone bought this cd from Amazon recently? Is there still a defect in ""Roadhouse Blues,"" or did you receive the second repressing with the defect removed? Thanks in advance for any replies."
3,"Less keys, more wheeze","3 1/2The Doors continued to open towards bluesy rock and close on a signature psychedelic sound they ushered forth, and depending which half of their career you prefer more will depend on how much you enjoy the work. I undoubtedly place it in that second bracket of lesser works- however a lesser Doors disc is still a higher disc for most other groups, with at least a few classic songs imprinted to guarantee purchase."
4,"Check into ""Morrison Hotel"".","I think we can safely say that the debut was the best of the bunch. After that I think they're all equally good, just different. ""Morrison Hotel"" starts out strong with the big hit ""Roadhouse Blues"", then goes to ""Waiting for the Sun"", (oddly enough not on the album of the same name). That is an excellent song. Both are on the ""Best of"". ""Peace Frog"" is a great rocker, and slides right into the smooth ""Blue Sunday"", almost sounding like one continuous track. That's sweet. Another favorite is the beautiful ""Indian Summer"", where Jim sings ""IIIIII love you....the best, better than all....the rest"". I imagine his girlfriend liked that one. All in all, ""Morrison Hotel"" is just as essential as any other ""Doors"" album. I've always enjoyed my stay."
5,I've seen fire and i've seen rain..,"After the pop disappointment ""soft parade"" and the Miami show the Doors were pretty much public enemies but still rocked. This album shows it, they were back into hard rock and roll they were well known for. The teenboppers were gone, the chicks were gone, Morrison was burning out, the band was getting better musically. Rolling stone said that ""roadhouse blues"" started out the album good but it goes downhill, no it doesn't! This is also the magazine that hated Led Zeppelin and loves the corporate pop bands! This is a good album, pure rock and roll and a great comeback getting the signature ""doors sound."" The Doors would record one more album together with Jim after this."
5,The Doors Cannot Make a Bad Album,"Anyone, a Doors fan or not, should own Morrison Hotel. It features numerous styles, and many of the Doors greatest songs, like ""Roadhouse Blues"", ""Waiting For the Sun"" (left off of the album of the same name but placed on this later album), ""Peace Frog"", and ""Queen of the Highway"", the best song on the album, in my opinion."
1,not the same lodgings,"The sound of the 2007 remaster of ""Morrison Hotel"" is cleaner, but the vocals on ""Roadhouse Blues"" have been altered. The bonus material drags on forever.Altering classic albums seems to be common: similar complaints have been lodged at remasters of ""Crosby Stills & Nash"" and The Rolling Stones' ""Goat's Head Soup.""So 1 Star for this 2007 version. ""Morrison Hotel"" itself is worth 5 Stars, but pick up an earlier version because this isn't the album that was released in 1970."
5,Jimmy is not dead!,"Whatever hippies, Jimmy will stab his own hotel if you don't stop being babies. Viva la Morrison."
2,People Are Strange when you're not into Jim Morrison's type!,"Only a few songs on this fifth album CD are on my more anticipated Best of collection. Like my favorites ""Roadhouse House"" and ""Waiting For The Sun"" which the rest of these tunes on here does'nt interest me here!"
3,"PRETTY GOOD, BUT NOT ONE OF THE BETTER DOORS ALBUMS","It seems to me that the Doors were burnt-out at the time they recorded this music; they turned to blues and just free-jamming with little originality. The music is not as good as the previous albums (CD's) and certainly not up to par with their last, ""L.A. Woman"". There are a few good songs, such as Waiting for the Sun and Roadhouse Blues; the rest are just not the usual Doors. Not really impressive."
2,No summary available,"What is it about this CD that inspires such glowing reviews? Doesn't rock, bad lyrics, what's so great about it?"
5,Oh man the extras,This is a reissued cd and full of bonus tracks.If your a doors fan as I am and have this on vinyl you will want to pick up this for the future.And what a great price.
3,Its Pretty Good,"After the craziness of The Soft Parade, The Doors came back and recorded Morrison Hotel certinaly not one of there best albums but its pretty good. Containing classics like Roadhouse Blues and Waiting For The Sun i recommend this album for only the big Doors fans"
1,But The Big Story On Action News Tonight Is.....,"""Well I Woke Up This Morning, and I Got Myself a Beer"". To the common working man that lyric probably ranks up there with the Holy of Holies. I know in middle, and high school it was recited at least once a day. I found it very unispiring. This whole album was uninspiring as The Doors pretty much fell flat on thier butts after the first album. This was rock bottom. The only good song that came from here was ""Waiting For The Sun"". ""Roadhouse Blues"" has a good riff, but the rest is stupid, and ""Blue Sunday"" is so downhearted that it makes me want to kill myself. The rest is inept at best. Obvious Morrison was preoccupied with his trial that he forgot to make inspiring music."
5,Morrison Hotel is Golden,"I have tried the Hotel California and it is fine. I prefer to stay at the Morrison Hotel. On gold disc, the sound is incredible!"
5,One from a great collection,"Morrison Hotel is a great album I recomend this album to any true Doors fan.This album contains one of the best Doors song ever writen, which is ""Peace Frog"".The album is great from beginning to end.A must have for any Doors fan."
3,AFZ 037-2 is what you need.,"The original pressing (AFZ 037) was defective as there were crackles on Roadhouse Blues. The replacement pressing (AFZ 037-X) suffered the same issue. The second replacement pressing (AFZ 037-2) does not have the defects of the previous two.If you purchase this disc from any retailer, be sure to contact AF to get the replacement."
4,It's been a long way from their first album...,"There is just one song on ""Morrison Hotel"" that reminds very much to their early phase (""The Doors"" album), and this is ""Waiting for the Sun"". The other songs are very blues-related, although in different ways. ""Roadhouse Blues"", ""Maggie M'Gill"" and ""You Make Me Real"" are strong blues-rock songs, ""Land Ho!"" sounds like a shanty, ""Blue Sunday"" is a sentimental (too sentimental!) love song. ""Indian Summer"" is in a way similar to it, it's very slow, but also more simple. Altogether, the Doors have made a very versatile album. Clearly, Morrison is the boss, and all the songs are centered on his lyrics, so they all last only between two and four minutes and it's a pity that the other band members did not have the opportunity for more instrumental parts and perhaps improvisation. But I would advice anyone who likes the blues to buy this album, although I don't rate it five stars."
2,Insignificant and boring,"After five years of waiting for a new Barry White record this one has come as a rather large disappointment. While ""The Icon Is Love"" could at least provide the sensation of hearing Barry White surviving into the 90s, ""Staying Power"" just puts you to sleep - it is sooo boring. Don't dare to look for quality here, for energy, for melody, for - life. Barry seems to have transformed into some kind of zombie giving us only the most predictable and empty material. The second star is given only for that slightly more solid title track. Please Barry, don't stay that way."
2,very average from this genius,after the great the icon is love Barry drops down on this album.the title cut is solid.but overall this disc is pretty lightweight and average.but i can't wait for the next cd from this genius.
3,"'Good Seasons' for a Barry White Comeback""","The voice is unmistakeable- even when you cannot see his face behind that little dancing bunny! No, not the Duracell bunny: the bunny in the ""Good Seasons"" dressings commerical. That reincarnated Ms. White has seen his ""all the Greatest"" title at Amazon.com benefit due to this spot.For me the classics are ""Practice What You Preach"" and ""In Your Wildest Dreams"" with Tina, as well as the Taylor Dayne remake ""Can't Get Enough of Your Love""...Here is too a L-O-OO-OOONNNN----GGGGG slow and deep comeback for Mr. White.How wonderful that he duet with Lisa Stansfield who was so faithful to his ""Never Gonna Give You Up"", a recent VH-1/ American club staple on this album."
1,Barry Just Doesn't Have It Anymore...,"Compared to his dynamite album releases in the 1970's, Barry White's musical talents have taken him in a slow downward spiral. Years ago, he used to belt out his husky, sexual voice whether it was an inspired, up-tempo love song, or something slower. His voice ""ran the show"" back then, and commanded attention. It doesn't anymore. Now lackadaisical, hypnotic instrumentation (dare I say dull and boring) rules over his music. This guy was so capable of putting out better music. You know Barry's creative juices have run dry when he includes the remakes of ""Low Rider"" by Eric Bourdon & War and ""Thank You"" from Sly & The Family Stone on this album. It is such a shame. Bring back the old Barry music from the 1970's....that was truly his best stuff. This 1999 release is just fluff. About as memorably exciting as watching paint dry on the wall."
5,This Barry White cd is his hottest by far!,"Barry's music has always been hot, but the fire is sizzling with his new cd, Stayin' Power. Put this cd on and you can't be responsible for what you might do. The man's voice literally sweeps you up into the moment. One cannot listen to this cd and not get caught up in the erotic and sensual music and lyrics that Barry pours out. After 25 years in the business, Barry just keeps getting better and better!"
2,"Same formula, no new thoughts, stick with the oldies","While this album perfectly duplicates the mood of his prior recordings, I see no reason to buy this album if you already own a fair number of his prior recordings. Perhaps no other artist is as consistent (some would say predictable) as Mr. White. This albums provides no new insights, no new takes on love ( I could have accepted at least a new way to phrase the language of love) and absolutely no change in style. Why not stick with the Barry White CD's you already have because there is nothing new here. The only reason this CD can be recommended is that you are able to hear his never changing formula with the benefit of today's recording techniques (more bass, better treble, no a.m. radio sound). Of course his consistent sound will be attractive to many fans who would not accept a new sound from him, but for this fan, I can only own so many CD's with exactly the same groove."
4,Solid classical feel good sounds from the legend...,Barry White has no equal when it comes to pure romantic tracks...the man is a living icon....
2,Linear Algebra: Friedberg,"This book is not that good because it proves many useless, or near trivial theorems, then leaves the more interesting and deeper theorems as homework exercises. I would go with the Kenneth Hoffman: Linear algebra book instead.David"
4,Elementary Linear Algebra,"I used this book in a junior-level course about a year ago. While the book is well written and the proofs are lucid, the exercises lack in providing any sort of challeng. Most of the proofs that students are asked to write in the exercises are very elementary, and follow directly from the definitions, theorems, etc.As for the authors' habit of incorporating definitions within the exercises, it makes me wonder how important they really are. It seems to me that if the defintion was of any import whatsoever it should have been included in the main body of text, not as an afterthought in the exercises. Over all, though, I think this is a good book for a course in elementary linear algebra."
4,"Good, With Reservations","This book is pretty good, I found it easy to learn from. To be clear, anyone approaching the material as presented here should be comfortable with proof techniques including proof by induction. This book uses the definition/theorem/proof/discussion technique throughout and the discussions are usually enlightening. The exercises range in difficulty from easy to challenging, but hopefully you have an instructor who can give you the necessary hints. For this reason I wouldn't recommend this book for self study.Reservations: As another reviewer stated, some of the topics are a bit murky, some things aren't explicitly stated that probably should've been. I suppose the author assumes you know some facts that maybe you've forgotten as I'm sure I did. Finally, the price is completely unreasonable, but that's standard nowadays.My biggest complaint is that sums, direct sums, and cosets are only found in the exercises yet mastery of these concepts is required later on."
3,Linear Algebra,"This linear algebra textbook is a good book. It has a nice look and feel to it. The author is able to convey the material in a straightforward and precise manner. For someone who is new to the topic, it would be helpful if all odd answers to the exercises were printed and not just a select few. The solutions requiring proofs are omitted. This is where students stumble the most."
2,"Disappointed, poor explanations of topics","This book reads like a novel. It does not help you visualize concepts, does not break down the material, and has very few good examples to help students grasp the concepts of linear algebra. I have enjoyed all of the other math courses I've taken before this one, and this book simply does not present the subject in an easy to learn manner. I would recommend another text."
4,"linear algebra- by frieberg, et al","i don't like pure math because i don't like writing proofs -- it's too hard for a brain like mine. but you really learn the definitions and theorems that way. in fact, there's really no other way to get those ideas deep in your brain. this is a pure math book. as such, it's very well written. the theorems and proofs must be easy to understand because i can understand them. if you're taking the first theorem-proof class in linear algebra this is a very good book. but i'd recommend the schaum's outline in linear algebra as a supplement. it's helped me a bunch get a better, different understanding of the theorems and good ideas on how to write the proofs."
2,An Extremely Frustrating Book,I have never seen a book which hides so many important details (and even basic definitions) in exercises. This book was terrible to learn from and even worse as a reference. It also omits or glosses over a number of important topics including quadratic forms and matrix norms.
5,awesome...i'd give 10 stars,"This book combines a very rigorous treatment (with a flavoring of abstract algebra) and interesting applications. The presentation is very clear and straightforward. You get theorems, a proof of each one, and curious exercises. Some exercises also challenge you to develop and prove results about some side topics. As you go through the chapters and learn more, you prove further results. Also, this book is the first which presented Jordan forms lucidly and thoroughly. Other texts shove it into the appendix, which is a mistake, since this topic is important.Finally, the applications are plenty. Standard ones like Markov chains, plus a few fascinating applications, like an entire section devoted to the development of the basics of Special Relativity.This should be the standard text on linear algebra, instead of that drivel by Strang."
5,One of McRae's finest sessions ever...,"This session by jazz legend Carmen McRae featuring afro cuban vibe king Cal Tjader is excellent. It belongs in any serious jazz collectors library. Absolutly essential, one of McRae's finest sessions ever..."
4,So you think Grant was a butcher...,"If you do, this is the book for you. Fuller adequately and methodically shatters the myth that Grant wantonly sacrificed his troops in battle. He refutes this notion with painstaking tables and charts which proves (surprise) that Robert E. Lee lost many more men per 1,000 than Grant. Fuller further shows that Lee's stature as a great general should be on tenuous hooks and that greater appreciation should be given to Grant's brilliance.Is the book unbiased? No, Fuller clearly prefers Grant, which is to his everlasting credit. Had more historians seriously compared Grant and Lee, USG's reputation wouldn't have been so seriously compromised today. Fuller lays the facts out on the table and shows that Grant beat Lee for a reason: he was the premiere American soldier."
4,Great first RC!,"We got this for our 2 year old and it was so easy for him to operate. I was a little worried about that, but it hasn't been a problem at all. I love that fact that it is soft and can't hurt the furniture because he hits it quite often. Another bonus, I saw this same one int he stores for [...] bucks more than what I paid through Amazon. So THANKS AMAZON FOR THE SAVINGS!!"
1,Defective Out of the Box,"The firetruck did not work from the beginning; several batteries were tried to no avail. Attempts were made to contact Discovery Channel Store via 1-800 number and Amazon.com, and no response was given."
2,disappointing!!!!,"I bought this for my 2yr old nephew for Christmas and it was a huge flop. Firstly, it took us forever to figure out how to get the batteries in the actual truck...the only instruction provided was an arrow at the bottom of the truck that made absolutely no sense. Once we figured that part out for some reason the front wheels would not spin which resulted in the truck only being able to go in circles but not forward or backward. After less than an hour of playing with it the back wheels stopped working also. After spending most of the day trying to fix the toy we eventually gave up and let him just push it around. In addition t the technical difficulties, the truck itself is pretty boring, maybe if it had some flashing lights or something my nephew may have been a bit more impressed!!"
2,Won't Turn,"Great except the turn button just makes the thing move slower. Its supposed to left turn tank style with right drive wheel going forward and left going back, but both just go forward much more slowly. The only bonus is our son is 3 and doesn't know it doesn't work properly and has no complaints or problems just moving it when it hits something."
2,A disappointing 1st RC experience,"It doesn't matter how old the child is, they want a toy like this to be responsive. But this toy does not work well. It doesn't turn well (the counter-spinning wheels have no traction on hardwood floors), and when it does, it only turns in one direction by design. This means you cannot turn it to steer. When it goes straight, it starts out at an angle from the direction it is pointed. In other words, you cannot really maneuver it, which is the whole point of a remote control vehicle. (The steering wheel design is therefore a kind of lie). This is very frustrating, even for someone with more coordination than the toddlers it is meant for. This toy promises to be a disappointing first RC experience."
1,GREAT TOY -- IF IT WOULD OF WORKED-- BROKEN HEARTED LITTLE BOY ON CHRISTMAS DAY....,PERFECT TOY FOR A LITTLE ONE... BUT IT DID NOT EVEN WORK...AND JUST FLUSTRATED HIM.... SO SAD ON CHRISTMAS DAY...FOR IT NOT TO WORK ONLY A FEW SECONDS... DON'T THINK I WOULD BUY TOYS AGAIN... TO HEARTBREAKING IF THEY ARE ALREADY BROKEN....
3,A happy boy,"I got one of these for our sons birthday and he loved it. OK so it's not one of the best available but I found it was good value for money. I think it is worth a try, but just don't expect too much. For a 1st truck it is OK."
2,Short life,Only worked for about the first 6 months and then after your replace the battery it goes a half an inch and then stops. It's pretty much doomed and time to chunk. My toddler is no longer interested once it won't move. Invest in a better quality motor truck.
1,Doesn't work!,"This toy was fun until it stopped working for no reason. We put new batteries but it didn't help. We always played gently with it, it looks like new but after playing with it for about 10 times it just stopped working. Only the sound is working. It was a gift and I do not recommend it, it is a waste of money."
5,FANTASTIC!,"This truly is great for a child's first remote control car. The sound effects are great! Not too loud and it really gets my grandson's attention. The two-button remote control is easy for him to operate and hold. Batteries easy to replace and last a really long time in both the car and the remote control. NO SPECIAL SCREWDRIVER NEEDED: Just a small phillips is all it takes. Highly recommended! We bought the police car, fire truck, construction loader and school bus. The soft body makes it safe for both child and furniture!"
4,fun toy for active son,"this is the second vehicle from this manufacturer that I have gotten for my son. He loves cars and with the 2 we have now, we have lots of fun playing with them both. The only problem I have had is that it does make a lot of noise so a volume control or selector would have been nice. It is very durable and will last longer than any regular RC. It's rubber like body which wraps around to even the bottom helps it to survive falls from over 3 feet, being hit by a tricycle and even kicked about. Great product for the money and fun."
3,Don't buy 2,"Overall, the remote control fire truck is a good toy. It seems durable, and works well. Be warned it's a little loud with no volume control. Also, we bought 2 of the Kid Galaxy remote control vehicles so that our 2 kids could play with the cars at the same time but unfortunately both cars respond to the same remote control, so it just doesn't work."
1,Defective after 1 month playing with it,"Our 2 years old son played with the fire truck almost everyday upon receiving this in the mail. He was 20 months then, lost interest after less than one month and started showing interest again 5 months later. The fire truck did not respond to the remote, we thought both batteries were flat, but replacing the batteries did not fix it. Amazon customer service told us their 30 days return/exchange policy and suggested we contacted the manufacturer directly. We then learned that the warranty of this product was only 2 months. I suppose the short warranty explains why the product only last 1 month....."
3,"OK toy, but doesn't hold my sons attention","I think this is a great toy, it seems pretty durable...my son has thrown it down the stairs once or twice and it still works. It really doesn't keep his attention though, he's only touched it twice in the past month and when he has played with it its only been for a few minutes. I do have one major complaint about it...you have to be standing fairly close to the car to keep it going...which means you have to follow it everywhere...it also doesn't seem to what to go unless you are standing behind it most of the time. All in all it is an okay toy but it does have a few minor problems."
2,Remote Control Shorts Out,"We bought this for our sons 3rd birthday. The remote shorts out and doesn't work well. Sometimes it works, and a few seconds later it wont respond. This is very frustrating for my son and us as well. We tried new batteries and it still happens. Hopefully we just got a bad toy, but given it is cheap and made in China, you have about a 50% chance of getting a working toy. Buyers Beware!"
1,terrible,broken straight out of the box... I wouldn't have been so frustrated except that we bought 2 and NEITHER worked. NOT ONE TIME... both got returned
1,great toy,I just love this toy but as soon as I went to try an try the toy out it did not work at all with the new batteries. I was so disappointed because one of the twins didn't have his truck to play with.
1,Not what I hoped for,"I really wanted a good remote control car for my little boys, currently ages nearly 2 and 3. The boys got it last year as a Christmas present. It has hardley been used and this is why - inorder to get the car to move you have to point it right at it and stay right by it and the battery life gets sucked right out. So either it has no power from dead batteries or the boys have to follow it so closely it gets boring. It's sat in the toy bin for a year now with no change in my opinion. Guess it's time for it to go."
1,Broke almost instantly,"Not very well made...broke almost instantly! My son loved the look and ease of use, until it BROKE w/ normal play...battery seems to not stay in place."
3,It's ok,"I bought this rc truck for my 2 year old son. When I tried to put in the batteries, my screwdriver was too big to fit in the small and deep hole...bought a new screwdriver, too small...bought another screwdriver...finally fit. Surprisingly the batteries only lasted a day...I don't know if it was the batteries or the car, but the batteries were brand new, so...Haven't used the truck since. Just too annoyed with it. I'm glad my son is not asking for it to work; he just enjoys it without new batteries.The quality of the truck seems good and durable. It's defintiely made to be beat up. It's a soft rubber type material."
4,Fire Truck For Everyone,"This toy was purchased for a 15month old boy, but it was played with by his 4 year-old-sister and their 34-year-old daddy...ok and Mom might have tried it for a little while too!"
4,"Nice toy, but no lights nor siren!","I thought I read in one of the reviews, that this toy was too loud! Actually, I was a little disappointed that for a fire truck, it has no lights nor siren!As a result, my son looses interest rather quickly and moves on to something else...It's otherwise, a nice and safe toy."
1,Poor Quality,"This toy was a Christmas gift for my son. I bought it new elsewhere, not on Amazon. Christmas Eve my husband and I were putting the batteries in only to find that in addition to the Double A batteries it required it also required a 9V battery. The only thing listed on the box was that it needed the double A batteries. At 10pm on Christmas Eve my husband found a gas station that was open and actually sold 9V batteries thank goodness! We put all batteries in and to our disappointment the truck barely moved with the remote control. You practically had to be touching the truck with the remote for it to move. After 24 hrs it didn't move at all! My son would just push it around the house instead for a few days and then he completely lost interest. Spend your money elsewhere!"
2,Possessed,"While my son loves playing with this toy, it also really scares him because as a previous reviewer mentioned it is possessed. For some reason it lurches forward on its own every few minutes which has startled me but petrifies my 2 year old. I actually came on here to see if there were any other similar reviews and just had to post something about it. Also like the previous reviewer mentioned, there is no siren or fire truck sounds - it just makes a loud grinding noise when its being operated. It is very durable and the remote control feature is easy to use - if only there was a way to exorcise it!!"
3,More fun for adults than for the kid,"My son loves firetrucks so we got this one for him to play with as he has several other automatic trucks. First the sound is really annoying, you'll get used to it but since I have some other automatics, this is most annoying one we have. second, It has a cute wheel that controls it but it only goes in a few directions. Lastly, It has withstood some knocking around and still works so far. 3 stars because our kid doesn't love it - he has a red toy race car that he likes better. (They could make the red on the truck brighter!)"
2,EAT UP THE BATTERIES!!!,"Cute toy, my 3 yr old liked it, but it eats up the batteries so fast that we took it to GOODWILL a month later and 2 battery sets latter. If it didn't eat up the batteries or had a rechargeable then it would be perfect :)"
2,poor quality toy,"We open it yesterday, the appearance of the toy are quite attract, but this new thing doesn't work well. The Spin button even doens't make it spin!"
1,Quit working day after Christmas,"While my 2.5 year old son was thrilled to get this for Christmas, the turn function on the remote control stopped working the next day. When we press the turn button on the remote, the truck shudders and stalls but does not turn. While it can still go forward, his interest waned considerably after the turn function broke. Now he points to it on occasion and says, ""That truck doesn't work."" What a waste!"
2,Review for RC fire truck,It is very hard to open the body of the truck to put the batteries and even after using the right kind of batteries it is kind of slow moving. Seems to be built well but my ds who is very fond of fire trucks does not like it very much.
1,Not impressed,"This toy is awful! I bought it for my son for Christmas and its already stopped working. I've tried replacing the batteries, which is a challenge to do, and it still doesn't work! Then randomly it will start moving in his toy box!! Not impressed..."
1,It would be great if it worked,"The radio control works intermittently at best, if it works at all. The wheels seem to rub the chassis and the truck will not move for more than two seconds before stopping. I tried replacing the batteries in the remote and in the car, but the toy acted the same. I returned the truck, will probably have to take a loss, but should have looked at the reviews instead of quickly buying this lightening deal."
2,very poorly designed,my son received this toy for christmas. the entire body of the fire truck has to be removed to put the batteries in. then when we got it back together we discovered that the back wheels (made of rubber) were sticking to the soft body of the truck so it would not move. in order to allow it to roll foward we had to cut away the truck body from around the back wheels. but when we finally got it working my son loved it.
1,No,"Did not work after 24 hours, turned once and that was it. Would be a great toy if worked, 16 month old enjoyed it while it worked."
5,great toy for a 3 year old!,"My 3 year old thought this toy was a lot of fun and it was def. worth the money! It travels fairly far and has no trouble driving on carpets, though it drives slower than on the floor. Overall really great product for preschool aged children."
3,Fun Looking but Weak Signal,"We bought this for our two year old to use as she loves to push buttons and make things ""GO!""We thought this would be a great toy for her to practice that skill with.We got it out, she loved the way it looked. We then put the batteries in and turned everything on.With brand new batteries, we were surprised to find that you have to stand within about a two foot radius to get the truck to move. Even then, it is sporadic and slow.So, the whole button pushing thing became kinda frustrating for her since it didnt always work and the truck now sits in her bedroom. Not super great, but ok for what it is and the price."
4,My Kids love it!,I purchase 2 of these cars - one school bus and one fire truck - for my 2- and 3.5-year-olds and they both love them. The 2-yr-old hasn't quite gotten the hang of turning it but loves to go forward and my 3.5-yr-old had the controls down in about 2 minutes. very fun.
3,Very low power on carpet. Painted poorly,"My Son loves this toy! It is painted very poorly and looks like a five year old child painted it. Great idea and really fun though. This truck is very small also.Does not have a lot of power on carpet. Sometimes it won't even drive at all on my carpet. Also when it drives the wheels squeak very loud. Like it needs WD40 on it or something. This toy does not cost a lot, however considering the quality of it I think it should cost even less.There are some great aspects of this toy and some major cons too. Also does not make any fun noises which would have been fun for my son!"
5,A 2 year old and his 1st RC fire truck,Simple for a 2 year old to use. Very durable! A 2 year old will play with this toy often.
4,Nice car for the price,"I was happy with the truck - it came quickly, is easy to use, and fun to operate. I wish there was an off switch for the sounds, though."
1,batteries impossible to change,"My son loved this when he first got it, but as some other reviewers have said, the batteries needed to be replaced very quickly. The screw covering the battery compartment is buried in a long thin tunnel that is so hard to get to I have given up on being able to change the batteries and we are going to have to throw it away. I'm so upset I wasted money on this toy. I went to the Kid Galaxy website to give them this input so maybe they could come up with a better design but there's nowhere to leave comments."
1,"its junk, dont bother","although i appreciate the rubber body, everything else, is pure junk. there was no human factors thinking or even any thought from a reliability point of view that went into this toy. you need a very thin screw driver to get the batteries into the body, i dont think many households have thin body screwdrivers.the motor lasted less than a day with my 2yr old. the reverse quit working, even the transmitter quit working and would work intermittently. i thought maybe the new batteries drained, but it in fact is the transmitter and receiver that work when they want to. dont even bother buying this thing, its not that you will be disappointed after a few hours of play, its the fact that i felt like i failed as a parent, my 2yr old wanted to play but even he lost patience and moved on to another toy. if u must buy it, please buy another as a backup. amazon shouldn't carry this product, its horrible. it couldn't have been made in china, it would have lasted longer!"
1,dosen't work,I gave this to my grandson for Christmas...It didn't work....How sad...My grandson was very disapointed to say the least. He unwrapped the toy and we put in the batteries and nothing...We will have to return it for something else.
2,Was great when it worked. All 10 minutes.,"Like many of the other reviewers I'm sad to report that this toy didn't last more than 10 minutes. We've changed the batteries but the motor seems to have lost significant power. If you turn the truck upside down and press the remote you can watch the wheels spin, but when you put the truck on the ground the motor isn't powerful enough to actually move the truck forward."
1,Broke after 20 minutes of use,Grandma bought this toy for my son. He loved the buttons and it was really cool while it was working. After about 20 minutes total of use the turn function stopped working. Now this firetruck goes straight really well and doesn't turn anymore. Pretty boring now that it is half broken :(
1,Not great,I bought this toy based on the other reviews and may have gotten a bad product. We tried different batteries and but you had to push really hard on the control in order for the truck to move. Not ideal for a 2 year old. We returned it.
5,Wonderful!,"This is the best remote control car out there for little ones. Actually, I think it may be better than some of the more expensive ones I have purchased for my older son over the years. My little guy got it for his 2nd birthday and absolutely loves it. His older siblings play with it as well. Great purchase!"
4,"Deep, spiritual...roots from different genres...",I just got this CD last night from an individual at the Dub Media Group...and I have to say that it's very interesting. I can't wait for Courtney to come out with some more tracks!
5,Helpful book,"For beginners, it's great. For seasoned orchid growers, it's very informative. I use this book a lot in orchid care & highly recommend it. Very satisfied with purchase as it's user friendly."
3,simple reading,A handy book for norvice orchid beginner grower like myself who have not any experience in raising orchids. Have not read the whole book.
3,Learning,"Information on the book I love it, because I learned a couple of tricks for orchids I didnt know.. but in reference to kindle what I dont like ... it doesnt have any effect when you turn the pages.... Its like flat paper reading.... details are important"
3,Good starter book,"A good starter book. Gives a complete, detailed and no-assumptions information about most orchids and the varieties, care and handling."
3,Orchids for Dummies,This book has too much about different orchids and too little about my orchid. It wasn't worth the money. They should write a book about how to take care of one specific orchid rather than be vague on all the orchids possibly known to man.
3,For dummies.,"The title says it all. It is a good starter and you'll learn how to take care of your orchids. The chapter about resources is truly excellent. However, this book won't take you much further from the basics, in my opinion. The colour plates are beautiful, but they are just a handful (8 pages). Black and white pictures don't make much sense here, after all this book is about orchids, right?In the same price range I strongly recommend ""Growing orchids"" by Rittershausen, which contains almost the same information of more expensive books, and shows hundreds of colour pictures of very good quality. If you are willing to spend a little more, buy either ""Understanding orchids"" or ""Orchid's grower companion"". Here you are paying for the ""for Dummies"" trademark. This book would be a good buy at half of the price.As of now, all the 5 stars reviews have been written by people with ONE review in their accounts. Ask yourself ""how come?"""
5,Medium Blue Is Well Above Average!,"Jenkins & Backes' Travis Berringer is to Phoenix what James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheaux is to New Orleans. Bakes & Jenkins characters reflect the grittier side of the Grand Canyon State with an interesting twist...their main character (Travis Berringer) has psychic powers. Unusual as the combination of policing and the paranormal may be, it works in Jenkins and Backes' first novel, Medium Blue. The story is well written, the characters engaging and their dialogue credible.Though the authors share with the reader much of the plot line in advance, the plot draws the reader in. Berringer, his partner (Frank Fauser) and Berringer's fiancée (Rachel Montgomery) are human, likeable and interesting. The book's concluding chapters are action-packed and the ending leaves a variety of options for a series.Simply put, Medium Blue is a good read."
2,Spare yourself,"The main character was interesting, but the author couldn't seem to begin to get around to the point of the book in the six chapters I read... very disappointing, as I was intriqued by the supposed premise.""Life is too short to read a badly-written book."" ~ T.M."
3,Highs and Lows,"I really bought this book for two reasons: The first being that I loved Mawer's first book ""Mendel's Dwarf"". The second being that the premise was interesting even though it had been used before. Unfortunately I wasn't able to find enough of a story to support the premise and had to wade through chapter after chapter of Fr. Leo's past which I found hard to relate to what was going on in his present. The parts dealing with Judas and the archeological find was well done and kept me reading. If he hadn't failed so with the subplots and flashbacks it would be a 5-star read.Read ""Mendel's Dwarf"" for Mawer at his best."
1,tries too hard,"I absolutely love a great mystery, and unfortunately, The Gospel of Judas promised more than it actually delivered. I can appreciate the author's well-crafted structure of the novel, but I literally forced myself to finish this book simply because I'd sunk the money into it. The action in this book lags...I thought with the discovery of the scroll things would perk up but, alas, that was not to be. Save the money and buy something with a little more oomph."
1,Could Have Been a Contender,"This could have been an excellent book had the author focused on the Judas scroll and all its implications. Instead, Mr. Mawer gives us a rambling, confusing, and time-hopping indulgence into the lives of a doubting priest, his mother, and various lovers, non of which generated any interest or empathy. This was a true disappointment."
4,interesting,"I picked this up out of the bargain section because ever since Harvey Keitel played Judas I have found him fascinating. This wasn't as revolutionary as that, but I still found it worth reading. There was something compelling about this story, so much so that I didn't want to finish it because I was afraid the ending would disappoint (it did a little). I don't think it was terribly realistic, either in terms of biblical history or the secret lives of priests, but there was some elegant writing and interesting character points."
2,This book has already been written.,Consider this:The Judas Gospel. By Peter Van Greenaway. 1972.A Dead Sea Scrolls document is discovered to be a gospel of Jesus written by the apostle Judas Iscariot. It has a VERY different viewpoint than that of the canonical gospels. It is quite a breathtaking viewpoint.The book dives right into the theological and societal implications of the discovery and fully explores the theme.Totally unlike this book.
1,The Temptation of Fr. Leo,"This is quite a disappointing tale, more about the trials and tribulations of a Catholic priest and his relationships with two women - his deceased mother and a married woman, than it is about any lost gospel."
3,I only read the Judas stuff,"I don't read much fiction.So I only skimmed the book for the Judas stuff which was tantalizing and well done I thought. (Somehow I've always felt Judas got a raw deal.)Other readers complained that the book is unfortunately titled and disappointing overall. They could be right!The non-Judas stuff I couldn't help but read in my skimmings seemed like a not bad story.The Judas stuff is only a tiny fraction of the text, however.So beware.The author does seem to have an accurate awareness of the scholarship needed to read and translate crumbling ancient manuscripts."
1,Don't waste your money,"took 100 pages for me to finally give up...this is an author in love with himself and writing...he forgot to tell a story. I kept wondering when he would get to the point...okay okay okay, I get it, he has the hots for a married woman...enough, what else...I gave up waiting for the mystery of the scrolls. Sounded like a good premise.I agree with the other reviewer. Too many good books out there to waste your time with a poorly written one.Moving on..."
5,Comic action picture: Kurosawa having fun,"Kurosawa set out to make a pure actioner - no deep meanings, no heavy thinking - and this was the result. Two clownish, greedy men are enlisted by a warlord (Toshiro Mifune) and a princess to transport a pile of gold across the mountains to re-establish the princess's defeated clan. They get into all kinds of scrapes, many of them improbable and comic - a la the old Hollywood western action pictures - and, of course, succeed in their task. Also like many western heroes, the characters are inspired by a code of honor that places duty above all else. George Lucas stole freely from this movie when he was making STAR WARS, including the lengthy fight with lances. Mifune is excellent, as are the two buffoonish, bumbling fools (later reincarnated by Lucas as R2-D2 and C-3PO). A fun movie to watch, especially in the hands of a master like Kurosawa."
5,Kurosawa having fun makes for a Great Adventure Epic!,"This is very lighthearted fun compared to Kurosawa's other films. It is also very funny and the two mumbling peasants are great fun, they are clearly George Lucas' inspiration for R2D2 and C3PO. The great Toshiro Mifune is also great in his role, again his screen pressence is commanding and demans attention, you can also tell he was having fun. This is one of the best adventure films of all time, it is one cliffhanger after another. It's only flaw is that it is a bit overlong, and some characters are not fully realized, but this is barely noticeable, since the films' main objective is to entertain, and it succeeds handsomely at that. I would recommend this film for those beginning to get interested in Japanese cinema, since it's lighthearted and the story is easy to follow, also they will get hooked on Kurosawa, which in itself is a good thing. All in all, great entertainment, I'm glad Criterion adopted it! A solid 8.5 out of 10!"
4,"A Tour de force, yes...","This is a movie that aims to please, from the spectacular slave revolt in the beginning, to the fantastical characters of a stoic-arrogant general's (Mifune in his muscle-man mode --- whoa!) mission to deliver his princess to safe territories. The sexual innuendos involving the general and princess, however, are a bit disturbing in hindsight. But what the heck.Worth mentioning, however, are the performances by Minoru Chiaki (in his last role for Kurosawa I believe - but correct me if you will) and Kamatari Fujiwara --- as the bumbling and greedy to the core farmers ""helping"" Mifune. They are simply hilarious and adorable, much more complex characters than R2D2 and C3PO!The opening scene, with the farmers stumbling into the frame and followed by a stray soldier's murder, is classic."
3,Kurosawa's second class is still impressive,"Although Toshiro Mifune gives once more a fine resital of acting, the story of ""Hidden Fortress"" is weak and long drawn to more than two hours. The main theme is double: the greed of the poor people in medieval Japan who were herded and crushed by the warlords like ants, and the rare opportunity of a princess to catch a glimpse of the real world of her vassals when she becomes a fugitive. Mifune plays the general Macabe who is a master of the martial arts and the main protector of the princess. The film follows the traditional Kurosawa lines but can not compare with the ""Seven Samurai"" and the ""Throne of Blood""."
4,classic kurosawa,loved watching this and started to watch others of kurosawa also. i can see where lucas got idea from star wars. theres no doubt that the classic movies have more than todays movies.
3,Where in the real world would you think this was used to make Star Wars?,"This came very quickly from the seller and it took me a couple of months to get to watch it. I liked the movie. The director does a nice job with his films. Good characters and a rather long plot development with a odd ending. Any way, I was told this was one of the movies that George Lucas took some things from in making Star Wars (the original movie). Sure there is a princess, but there isn't much else that would lead me to think that it had anything to do with Star Wars. If the two guys that were the comic relief were supposed to be like the droids, then why were they always acting as traitors? They were not remotely like that in Star Wars. There was no big dance scene in Star Wars. There was no Death Star. There were no lightsabers!"
5,The Original Star Wars ... even George Lucas admits it,"This is the story, including the characters (left virtually intact) that became Star Wars. Take away the special effects, and here it is."
3,Relatively lame,"This album definately has some catchy tunes, but there has been a huge shift in their music from the punkier 'Not so tough now' 'Meet the Family' and earlier releases. Worth buying, their softer music will definately attract newer more commercial customers - but punk fans are bound to be dissapointed."
2,Watta letdown,"Had this been the band's debut, Frenzal would no doubt have been heralded as a force in the making. And rightly so. But coming as it did on the heels of the brilliant Meet The Family and the almost-as-brilliant Not So Tough Now, Camel is a major disappointment. There's some good stuff here (Do You Wanna Fight Me, We're Going Out Tonight, So Much Fun), but overall it's too inconsistent. One for Frenzal newcomers only. And if you can track it down, snaffle up a copy of Mongrel, a live album from Frenzal's Vans Warped tour of a couple of years back. It was released in Oz as a bonus disc with Family, and it's easily one of the best live pop/punk albums on the planet. Your ears will love you for it. Trust me."
5,"""Tree Huggers,"" Read This...","If you have ever been shamed, ridiculed or pathologized for feeling connected to nature, animals, tides, the sea creatures or to the rhythm of life (though intuitive dreams, psychic phenomena, etc.) YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK. A brilliant Jungian analyst explores the fascinaintg idea that these phenomena are not only not pathological, but in fact represent an evolutionary process by which our psyches (Self, Soul)are trying to right the lopsided Western, power-driven egoic approach to life that is, in fact, killing us.A must read for therapists, ecologists, psychologists, people interested in transpersonal psycholgists and those of us who can ""hear"" the animals and nature as they cry out in agony."
1,Mentored,Curiosity go the better of me and the item was cheap... Lucky for me it was cheap.....I suppose the mentor will need to sell several more million to make himself a millionaire.
3,"OK, depends on what you are looking for","This book is actually two subjects.The first third of this book explains how the author rose above an early life of failures and mediocrity. The author met a mentor who emphasised respecting other employees, people, and profit sharing. This mentor was a business partner and their company ended up making millions.The next two thirds of the book is about how to write infomercials since that is what the author does for a living.The book is a very detailed personal account of his company, events, and infomercials. Some references to the bible.For me there's not much new here since I've read plenty of motivation and advertising books. But let's say you had a bad start or want to learn about infomercials, this book may be suitable for you."
3,Great advise--too much about him.,"Some time ago I read another book by Mr. Scott. I can't remember the title of the book, but I remember it being much the same as this one. He went on and on about his accomplishments; he went to school with Stephen Spielberg, held 9 unsuccessful jobs after graduating from college, wrote a successful screenplay (or something), and is now a successful primary partner in a major advertising company. It's great that he has had so many successes in his life, and I don't mind reading about it--once. To dwell on it in every book he writes gets a little annoying. On the other hand, he does offer a lot of great advise to readers; pointing out the fact that each and every one can accomplish equal feats. His writing style is entertaining. Though there are better books in this genre, I do recommend this book."
1,Collecting dust,"Insights are of little value. Essentially can sum up the book with this: get others to do the work for you to leverage your talents.Very repetitive with nothing new to say.A book for suckers, of which I am one.The title should read, ""How to Make a Million by Selling a Worthless Book to Suckers."""
2,Just a Cheerleading Book,Spends most of the book talking about his story and that you should get a mentor. Not recommended if you want a book with trading wisdom.
4,Great but somewhat cheesy.,"The book is a little cheesy in that it constantly uses car analagies for everything, specifically the Porsche Carrera.I have not finished the book yet, but I believe it will continue to be a great read, and I think I will benefit from reading it! This is another one of those books that everyone looking to learn and improve their lives should read."
2,i guess for a time capsule kind of thing,"i guess it falls into one of those so bad its good type movies and moves fast along enough. the wrestling part sometimes r cringe worthy and the fat guy with the earing on his face (cant remember his name) over acts so badly its the worst thing bout the movie. everyone else i can take. but that guy who i think was in a cyndi lauper video who just bounced off walls or something. but anyway, if u want to kinda get a hint of the ol 80;s i guess this would b ok but i sure wouldnt pay 20!! its on for free on 'thistv' so thats how i watched it."
2,Body Slam,"Awful, awful, and awful, ""Body Slam"" will only appear to the most seasoned pro-wrestling fan, wanting to poke fun at the goofiness of the 80s and just how far some wrestlers have come in the acting world. MGM's technical presentation isn't outstanding, but for as terrible as the movie is, it feels better than it should be. The general population should stay far away from this one though. 2 stars."
3,"The songs you know and are tired of, freshened up once again","Were it not for the tracks that sound like Kenny G, this album would be great. To be honest, how many covers of Christmas songs do we need? I suppose if you like the band's style, its great, but I just get tired of hearing the same old songs done in different styles. If I ever do a Christmas album, I'm going to write all original songs. But to comment on the rest of the album, I liked the renditions aside from the Kenny G ones. The style reminds me strongly of Mike Oldfield or Jean-Michel Jarre. So if you like these styles and Kenny G, or if you're familiar with the band and like their style, then this is the album for you."
2,Oversized for our dog,Our dog weighs 23 pounds. The product is warranted for dogs 20+ pounds. This is clearly misleading and I think we would have been better suited with the PetBuckle harness for dogs designed for dogs under 20 pounds. The product is high in quality. We were dissatisfied because the application for our pet was misrepresented. We will donate it to the local animal shelter.
2,does not stay in place,"I got this seat belt for a medium sized dog. The one good thing about it is that the quality looks and feels up to the same standards as a regular car seat belt. The problem is that the buckles are supposed to rest on top of the dogs back when secured and because they are heavy, they slide down the dogs side making the harness loose on one side and tight on the other. I have tried making the belts tighter to the point where it seems uncomfortable for the dog and they still don't stay in place. Another minor issue is that the tether is also so long that my dog can climb half way to the front seat from the back before it restrains her even when it is adjusted to it's shortest length. I am looking for a replacement that has a better harness design.**Update: I got the kurgo trufit to replace this product and it fits my dog much better.**"
4,Keeping the Pet Buckle Harness in Place,"We put a single stitch in the plastic diamond (where the straps cross) to custom fit this for our dogs. You can cut out the stitch to resize if needed but it keeps the straps positioned for safety. Because the buckles slap around when walking, our dogs were very happy using this as a walking harness. Hope this helps because it was a good car harness."
5,very good,"Although I am an experienced user, I have learned a lot from this book. It is very thorough and detailed yet easy and even fun to read. Thanks to McClelland's co-operation with Adobe, it contains inside information that I never spotted anywhere else (this is the 5th Photoshop book I've read), but also constructive criticism towards the Photoshop team.My only complaint is that some of his examples are (although very extensive) not very practical: I learned the effects of the Exclusion blending mode, but no useful purposes.But still - along with the very specialised 'Photoshop Channel Chops' - this is the best Photoshop book I know of."
3,"Good, but not great, reference work","I've owned previous editions of this book, and really my greatest disappointment was that much of this book was the same. It is still a great reference guide (much like the Illustrator Bible for version 9), but it suffers from a bit of author protelization regarding various likes and dislikes. Still, this is probably the best ""official reference guide"" out there on Photoshop 6.0."
4,Every little aid helps,"As a ""senior adult"" with both arthritis and Parkinson's Disease, I need all the help I can get. My handwriting has become virtually impossible to read because it is so small. Trying to read my grocery list in the grocery store is sometimes a real guessing game. The Pen Again writing stylus is a real help. I am still adjusting to the new finger placement, but I do believe it is an advantage."
1,FAILURE,i AM STILL WAITING FOR DELIVERY. pLEASE CONTACT YOUR VENDOR OR CANCEL ORDER. DO NOT CHARGE MY ACCOUNT.
4,Better than a helper,"I needed something to bleed my older European cars. I got an '83 944 and an '85 VW Vanagon. On these cars you can not do the job correctly without a bleeding system. It works nicely on these cars with the supplied attachments. However I do the bleeding process a little different than the instructions. I DO NOT fill the ""Power Bleeder"" (""PW"") reservoir with brake fluid I only fill the car's brake fluid reservoir. I Attach the ""PW"" unit and pump up the pressure (see your manual for the proper pressure). I then bleed the system. I checking the pressure and re-pump if I have to. I keep an eye on the car's brake fluid reservoir and only add fluid to the reservoir not the ""PW"". It takes a little more time and you have to disconnect and reattach the ""PB"" to fill the reservoir but no mess."
1,Very simply: Motive 0250 Universal Brake Bleeder does'nt work,Very simply: Motive 0250 Universal Brake Bleeder does'nt work.Very cumbersome to use and unable to get a tight seal on Master Cylinder.
3,"Overpriced, lightweight, rust-prone","I had a hard time replacing my old, beat up small stockpots and was thrilled when I found ones to match. I also needed to replace the larger one and this matches the smaller ones. I was willing to pay more than I thought I should have because it matches the others.They are all really nice for the money, but a lot lighter weight than the old ones. The only disappointment was finding that the knobs rusted after I washed them. I washed them by hand when I first got them but when I pulled one out to use for the first time, I saw that the knob was rusting where water had gotten under it. I just ordered new plastic knobs for the whole set. Now I will be able to put them in the dishwasher, too."
4,"""variety, moderation and balance"" Very Inspiring","If there is one thing,but there were many,that I got from this book is that the Love of food and dining my mother has shared with me is healthy. For the rest of the women who are in the a constant state of ""diet"" Ms. Waterhouse explains that you need only trust you own body to find its balance. Very Zen"
1,DO NOT BUY USED,I ORDERED THIS BECAUSE i WAS STARTING A AT HOME POSITION AND PAID FOR 2 DAY SHIPPING AND IT SAID IT WAS LIKE NEW THE DAMN THING DIDNT EVEN WORK !!! SO DISAPPOINTED THAT I PAID EXTRA SHIPPING GOT THE PHONE AND IT DIDNT WORK I ENDED UP GOING TO OFFICE MAX BUYING PHONE AND PAYING 3 TIMES COST WHEN U SEE A GOOD BUY NOT ALWAYS A GOOD TRADE OFF WOULDNT RECOMMEND
5,What a great solution!,"As we needed to set up a temporary office, we did not want to invest in a complex and expensive telephone system. We did, however, want features such as call transfer and intercom. This phone does it! We are very happy with it and highly recommend it to others."
2,Keeps getting worse ..,"I got one of these phones about a year ago. It is a little big, a few too many options, but I thought it would be OK. The first thing I noticed is it doesn't light up when a line is in use. I let that go. It took awhile before I noticed it would drop any calls put on Hold. Then the Intercom light comes on and beeps for no reason. Now all the EXT lights on the right side keep flashing.I gave it two stars because it still works (after a WHOLE year - sarcasm), but lined phones are not new technology. They shouldn't have this many unexplainable problems. Maybe I should give it one star!"
3,"It's okay, nothing special","It's okay, nothing special. Although it holds 50 phone numbers, by the time you scroll down to the one you want, it is almost faster to just dial it yourself if you already know the number. It might be better for a business than a private home as you can write in up toeight extention numbers."
2,Not a big fan,Have to bend over to see the caller ID- Which is not lit when a call comes in. It would be nice to just glance at the phone. I don't like the variety of ring tones.
4,Solid speakerphone,Good quality phone that I would recommend to others. Only complaint is that there is only 3 speed dial buttons on the phone.
2,Hey Panasonic: Time to Update Your Phones,"The KX-TS3282 works fine; that's the good news. The buttons are labeled well enough, the speakerphone works OK, etc. But gee whiz, Panasonic, the design looks like it's from the 80s: The display is low res, and not back-lit, the button label text and layout is dated; all-in-all, it looks like a product that's begging for a refresh. Especially a back-light for the display. But as a phone, it works."
4,Business Phone,I had a chance to use the Panasonic KX-TS3292B in my home office thanks to a friend who lent me one. Now I need to buy my own. This is a great phone for any small or home business although I'm not sure why it's listed here for $129.99 list when Panasonic's own site shows the MSRP as $99.95.
4,A great land line,"We are all so tuned into wireless, but if you need a 2 line land line phone, this is the one. The sound quality is outstanding, and it has enough bells and whistles , but it is not overloaded with useless functions."
2,high tech company with short vision for reality,"There is no display light in the caller ID panel. I read the reviews and was aware of it not being there but had no idea how poorly the display was so uinreadable. Terrible waste of money for the huge inconvenience of this badly designed sysytem. Othereise the phones works all right.Dr J Dallas, TX"
4,"Good, solid performer",I am happy with this phone - it has more features than I need and the voice quality is adequate.
3,Missing a couple of features,"This phone basically works well, including the speaker phone which on a lot phones works poorly.Missing from this phone is an voice mail message indicator (ie:flashing light)and the line in use lights do not light whenanother phone is the office is in use."
1,Poor service,I am very disappointed with the product and product support. I bought the units primairly for the intercom capability and can not get all four to communicate with each other (only three) I have been E-mailing and talking with Panasonic almost daily with no success. The individuals that I deal with appear to be reading from a script after you tell them the problem. If I still had the boxes I would return them. Very frustrating. I paid for a telephone wiring technican to inspect all the lines which check out OK. The telephones work fine. If you can help my case number is 29555167. A dissaatisfied customer
3,Odd workings with a headset,"Just an FYI for users wanting to use a headset with this phone.When you have a headset connected, you can not use the speaker phone nor Handset on this phone. In order to use them you need to disconnect the headset connector.Otherwise the phone is adequate, but wish it had a back lit LCD.If I had to do over, I would choose something else. But I will be keeping it rather then go through the hassle of returning it.***Update*** The Headset operation was to annoying in the long run, I returned this phone."
2,It's ok,"The physical quality of the phone is good. My major complaint with this phone is that everyone tells me my voice cuts in and out when I am on the speakerphone talking. I have to get down right next the the mic and even then it is not that good. Most of my time is spent on conference calls, I was really looking forward to this working right, but when I have to speak I need to pick up the handset if I want to ensure that I am heard correctly."
4,Great Phone,Excellent phone. I was looking for a phone that would handle 2 lines and have a good speakerphone built in. This did the trick.
1,Arrived DOA,"I had to replace my old AT&T; 962 and wanted to use a headset with the new phone. After researching for weeks I ordered the Panasonic KX-TS3282B.As soon as I unboxed the parts I noticed the handset was very bulky and felt like I was holding a shoe against my face. After connecting the phone to power I was disappointed to see there was no image on the display and none of the lights such as speakerphone, line1, or line2 would light. It would ring but was obnoxious. I suspect a bad power supply, so I returned the unit.Recommend an AT&T; 993. Speakerphone sounds great and the handset is comfortable talking for hours."
1,Bad Receiver/Handset,"I received this phone and the Receiver/Handset was not working and I was unable to get a replacement for it. The customer service is terrible, as I believe Panasonic does not support this model anymore.I received this phone and the mouthpiece on the handset has never worked.I decided to try and replace the handset but nobody sells the part, so I was essentially stuck with a ""paperweight"".As stated the mouthpiece of the handset has never worked. The user can hear the person on the other end but the person on the other end cannot hear the user. The phone has never worked and I could not find a replacement part."
3,Great phone but cannot adjust mic volume on headset,I got this phone for its two line caller id and speakerphone capability with the added capability to use a headset for teleconferences. The caller id and speakerphone work great.The basic problem I had was that the Panasonic headset I ordered at the same time had no mic volume adjustment and many of the people I called reported that my voice was soft. There appears to be no solution for the mic volume problem other than buying an amplifier that costs about the same as the phone!
2,Great sound / lacking features that are needed,"Like others here I'm wishing I had read the reviews. I saw how many 5's there were and read the product description. I'm astounded that the phone has (a) no message indicator for voicemails; (b) no indicator light when one of the other lines is in use (so if I pick up the phone and start dialing I may well be interfering with someone else talking on the line in the house); (c) no backlight on a display that is difficult to read even in decent light - especially because the phone angle is so low that I have to change positions (almost stand, leaning over the phone) in order to use the display. I assumed these three items would be standard issue. I do love the sound quality - I record webinars and I'm probably going to keep the phone for awhile only because the sound quality with the headset jack is so good. (Hence a 2 star rather than 1)."
3,Be Careful which item you're ordering!,"I haven't had a chance to use this product yet, so this is NOT a quality review. Three stars are due to Amazon and their misleading title/description of the product which has led to a problem. This is a prompt post to prevent others from having the same problem I've just run into.Amazon lists this as item 0107 which is the Motive bleeder with THREE PRONG adapter. However, today I received my order and I was sent the TWO prong adapter set, item number 0106. The description for the product says you may receive either adapter, but from the item description, it appeared I was getting the 0107. I now have to contact Hoerr to get this fixed, and I'm sure it's going to cost me a bundle in shipping. Just FYI before anyone else orders so you don't get the wrong item. The title is misleading."
4,still many choices,"Chevance gives good coverage to both the hardware and software issues. In the field of multiple/concurrent processing, there is still a variety of hardware offerings. You get a discussion of trends. Most importantly of whether the Intel or AMD chipsets might predominate over more specialised chipsets for future architectures. The economics of mass produced cpus suggests that you may want to hedge your bets as to what you commit to.Further up the food chain, the book goes into various software approaches, especially with an eye towards being deployed on Web servers. Unlike some specialised multiprocessors, which might be mainly used in science, the Web servers have broad appeal. Here, Enterprise Java Beans, object pooling and other subjects are gone into. However, while this section of the book may have broader appeal, it is more comprehensively covered in other texts."
5,A LONG LOST CLASSIC!,"grab this while you can!...this looks fated to be one of those power pop lost classics unless it gets a miraculous reissue soon..the label that issued this crashed and burned and with it the promotional budget for the record..MTV refused to show the controversial video for ""action kid"" which featured lead singer eduardo llanes simulating ""it"" with puppets....pick it up before its going for 100$ on ebay.. trixie is about as creamy as they come..eastern market soho will get in your brain much the way a guided by voices songs does and never leave!....a little bit of pixies a little bit of the kinks...a whole lot of pop from washington dc's reigning psychedelic power pop supremes"
5,Trancendent!!,"Quite possibly, the finest rock and roll since Sir Paul, John, George and Ringo went thier seperate ways. Thack 8, Ocean City, is the bounciest, trippiest tune in decades. Try it! Listen to it! You WILL like it!"
4,been looking for years!,I had a copy of this album several years ago that was lost to time. I was thrilled to have found a copy of it here. It worked fine and has entertained me yet again. Thank you kindly!
4,Grunge reborn,"Michael Pitt, more known for his cinematic work than musical, is a great songwriter and proves it with his band Pagoda. The effort is a solid album that can take repeated listening. The only thing to criticise is that it does sound like they want to be Nirvana. Saying that, they do have a less 'produced' sound than Nirvana ever had (the sound resembles Bellow's ""Look Out! Bellow..."" e.p.), and the inclusion of a cello-player in the band lifts the music above 'just another grunge band'.Thurston Moore has put his name on the sleeve to support the band, a gesture of good will no doubt, because of the work he and Michael Pitt did together on Gus Van Sant's superb ""Last Days"".Pagoda is an album I've listened to surprisingly many times. ""Death To Birth"" is a truly captivating and addictive song. It's the stand out track amongst many superb concoctions.I hope to hear a lot more of Pagoda over the next years!"
3,A TENDER & ROMANTIC REUNION,"At seventeen, Marni Lange fell in love with a very handsome young man during a summer in Maine. The romance was cloaked in secrecy, which added to the pain and guilt she suffered after a tragedy that abruptly ended the relationship.Fourteen years later, Marni is the CEO of the family corporation, poised to launch a very special magazine. And who should show up as the photographer hired by her publishing division? None other than ""Web,"" now known by his full name of Brian Webster.What follows is a story that might seem predictable, but that brings to it the conflicts, obstacles, and finally, a resolution that was denied the two of them years before.WhileFirst, Best and Onlyhad very little in the way of a plot, the romance was portrayed beautifully. The settings were gorgeously described and the reader could feel herself right in the midst of it all. Enjoyable story that earned three stars from me. Not Delinsky's best work, but a sweet tale nonetheless."
1,Delinsky's latest was a let-down,"I have been a Barbara Delinsky fan for many years, now. However, her latest, ""First, Best and Only"" was such a disappointment. She leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination where the love (sex) scenes are concerned, and I found the story line dull and shallow. This should have been published in mass paperback, in my opinion. I won't invest in any more of her hardbacks."
3,Enjoy AGAIN!!!,I read the reviews but I still read the book. I understand the complaints however I enjoyed the book. It was short and refreshing to me. Maybe because if I had the opportunity to have a second chance of my first love I would jump at the chance. Stop being bitter. Most love stories are alike. Different names different places but the heart is where it all happens. Enjoy every love story you can enjoy one two and maybe three times.
2,Preachy,"I had such high hopes for these books. I only read the whole series because I did fall in love with the characters, but you need a vivid imagination. Ms.Wallace writes her books about teaching a moral or a lesson and incoporates her characters around what she's trying to preach about. Instead of the lesson and morals Ms.Wallace tries to have her readers pick up on, she looses us because within the whole series her characters do not grow. Some of the dialogue is so horrible! Ms.Wallace writes lines between Erik and Isabelle (and many other characters) that get right to the point, that bring up the past right away like they haven't spoken about it which for bestfriends is really unrealistic. Though the book isn't a terrible loss to an extent, there's so much potential."
5,"Oh, The Pains of High School!","It is so easy to get wrapped up in the imagery and life of Erik and Isabelle. I found myself reliving some of the painful and good moments of high school, almost 35 years ago.Young people now have gay fictional characters they can relate to in Erik and Isabelle. Also, this book may open dialogue among many students as they are introduced to high school and a world of diversity."
4,Decent,"The packaging doubles as a reusable case. The driver's handle is cheap and made of plastic. Otherwise, it works well. Better than the cheap set I bought at Radio Shack."
5,"It's Rosemary Clooney, people!!! Enough said! :-)","Who doesn't like the Cole Porter songbook. I love Rosemary Clooney and purchased this disc for one song- ""In the Still of the Night""... I think it's from Rosalie.. it's an awesome song that Rosemary jazzes up and owns. I couldn't tell if this disc was audiophile quality, but on my car's Bose system, it sounded awesome!!!! I would definitely recommend this cd."
1,What Would Jesus Read?,"Jesus would probably not like his followers to read this book. It is a moralistic message and the gospel and the work of Christ is NOT primary. This ultimately makes it a person centered book and NOT a Christ centered book. If it is Christian at all it is christian with a little ""c"""
2,Could be better,"This starts out fine, with a great premise (living your life asking ""What would Jesus do?"" in each situation), but gets bogged down about 2/3 of the way through and doesn't recover. Plus, the author only tackles this from the patronizing view of the rich practicing Christianity on those less fortunate. Too bad he didn't throw in a few chapters from the viewpoint of po' folks. Still, the original premise is well worth thinking about."
3,"Inspiring, but weak","The first half of Sheldon's book, which popularized the phrase ""What would Jesus do?"" in the early 20th century, is poignant as it drives home the meaning of that phrase, which for many people today has become just another Christian slogan with too little meaning. The first half of the book is worth a read as it brings practicality to the much quoted phrase.However, the second half of In His Steps, grows a bit stagnant by the end of the book. Though there are connections between the two parts/settings, we are yanked into the second half (and second setting) without much apparent reason. More bothersome, is Sheldon's overuse of extreme statements (i.e., ""never had he...""), which in the first half of the book is alright, but by the end becomes tiring.All in all, this book may be worth reading, but I can't help feeling that it would be much better off with only the first eighteen chapters."
3,Odd Book,"This wasn't a bad mystery, just a very odd one. This is the first book in this series I've read and will be the last. The two main characters - a ghost from the 40's, Jack, and a modern bookstore owner, Penelope, have a strange sort of symbiotic relationship going on. The author even seems to be pushing towards having them fall in love...which seems to make no sense to me. The plot, which is about the murder of various society debutantes, is rather sensational and boring. I just couldn't buy into the entire ghost relationship of this book - I don't have anything against books that use ghosts, just this one is way too out-there for me."
4,Mystery in the Mystery Book Store,"Alice Kimberly has once again piqued the entertainment quotient of the reader. She has the ability to cause out-loud laughter, particularly in the dialogue between her central character, Penelope Thornton-McClure (bookstore owner) and her ghost PI, Jack Shepard, who mysteriously died in 1946. Although her romantic notions are a little bit of a stretch, you, as the reader, cannot help but read on....knowing the farce is provided as a ""fun-filled scenario"".The quirky characters, written for background, includes help-mates for Penelope and suspects for the crime. Sometimes, the reader is not sure which is which and that provides the happiness is....... meter count for the reader.If you have a rainy Saturday afternoon - or a quiet no-one-is-available-to-do-anything evening - pick up Alice Kimberly and I promise - the hours will go quickly because of a pleasurable book."
5,ghost and the dead deb,"Good old fasioned mystery. No gore or violence, just a bit of humor and good plot lines. I realy like the author."
5,Love it!,"I absolutely love this series! The characters are easy to relate to and entertaining. Its a fun, easy and quick read. Highly recommended!!"
3,"GROW SOME BACKBONE, GIRL!!!","I was really hoping the heroine would develop more strength for herself in this second story of the series but she was still the hand-wringing, bowing-to-anyone-to-stay-away-from-any-confrontation doormat. And to only add to my negative opinion of her, she does some really silly things in this story regarding evidence. Also, there was too much of the heroine and not enough of the supporting characters so the book became rather stale with a pretty bland ending. The next one (The Ghost And The Dead Man's Library) was much better."
5,A Small Treasure!,"This is a short book that can be read in one good, long sitting. But he who has the perspicacity to read it will have gained great initial insight into traditional Catholic prophesy.It must be noted that the book is a bit dated in terms of historical interpretation. Completed in the early seventies of the last century, there was much emphasis on the monolithic communist empire in terms of historical interpretation. But, if the Zionist movement is substituted for communism, the prophesies and interpretation make perfect sense even today.This lovely little book should be a source of great reflection and further study. We are very grateful to the wonderful folks at TAN Publishing of Rockford, Illinois for bringing it to print in this attractive new format."
5,This is simply a great book,"Hello,I strongly recommend this book to everybody, even to those who are not catholic. This book contains a lot of important information relevant to our times. It is easy to understand that we approach the historic moment when many of these prophecies will be fulfilled. Some of these prophecies were written hundreds of years ago, yet they seem to describe our time in detail. The only point that distorts the interpretation of the prophecies proposed by Ives DuPont is when he speaks about communism. However, we should consider that the book was written a long time ago when communism was very important in the world. These prophecies have been stored by the Holy Catholic Church through the centuries and they are meant to be a convincing proof for those who question the authority of the Pope. The fulfillment of these prophecies will be the ultimate sign to establish that God really exists and that He totally supports the Holy Catholic Church. May God bless you all."
3,"Interesting, but dated","Dupont presents a comprehensive list of prophecies made by various Catholics (mostly saints and popes) through the centuries and adds his own interpretations. It is an interesting read, but this is a very dated book. Dupont relates most prophecies to the Cold War - he talks about Soviet Russia going to war against Communist China, about East Germany rising as ""Prussia,"" etc. He is also highly crtical of the post-concilliar Church and implies that the coming chastisement is in part brought on by Vatican II."
5,See Ya!,"The magic of the songs on this CD is that they groove and move you at the same time. The music is great for dancing and the messages are encouraging. Most of the tracks are in the ""house"" music tradition, however there is one ballad ""Then What?"" with a wonderful guitar melody, and a latin beat groove, ""Lambada"". Gillia's voice is just wonderful. This artist can truly sing and does not use electronic tricks like many new recording artists today. I am really enjoying this CD. If you are the type who can appreciate great dance music that's fun and soul stirring, you'll enjoy it too."
4,A great disc,"This disc has great power. It's sort of a combination of neoclassical, power, and thrash metal with a super excellent guitarist. The song ""17th Century Chicken Pickin"" is one of my favorite shred instrumentals. Only downside is that sometimes some of the songs start to sound the same (can't hink off hand, but the opening riff to ""speed demon"" can be heard in about 4 other songs) a good disc for those interested in shred and metal."
4,A Worthwhile Purchase...,"I haven't listened to Impellitteri since ""Stand In Line"". (due to Graham Bonnet's departure)Guess I've missed out! At first listen, ""Crunch"" is a well crafted disc that begs to be heard by the masses. Rob Rock's vocal range is quite good, though I'd like to hear him belt it out a bit more. (scream for me!)All the guitar riffs are fresh and don't suffer from what I like to call ""Malmsteen syndrome"". (too much soloing) Since you get both ""Crunch"" and ""Screaming Symphony"" for one price, its an offer you shouldn't refuse. I'll add to this review or start another after listening to ""Screaming Symphony""."
4,This CD is good but too short,"This is a great CD but the songs are too short. If they really wanted to get 101 bands on an album they should have released a few discs, but what can you do? Now, onto the CD. It has great songs by Blink 182, which is just a bunch of foul language, NoFx, White Flag, Black Flag, Anti-Flag, Ataris, and AFI. There are however some really bad bands.(Lunachicks) The best thing about this CD is that the songs featured are not the best songs by each band. It is great in that it gives you the opportunity to discover 101 bands for eight bucks. If you bought a CD from each of the bands on here you would spend almost $1500, OUCH! One more thing, there is a confused reviewer talking about 5 yrs on the streets, which is another great punk comp, but don't get them confused. they say blink's ""Dancing w/ Myself is on here but it's not. They also say NoFx is not on here. So just watch out."
2,Ehhh,"Short Music For Short People is perhaps too short for me. The songs aren't really songs, like someone said. It seems to me that Fat Mike said, ""hey, let's take a chance"" and he did, but it didn't work. If you ask me, the best songs are from the already established bands like Blink 182, Offspring, Green Day, Pennywise, The Vandals, The Ataris, Unwritten Law, AFI, Nerf Herder, NOFX, Misfits, Guttermouth, etc. A lot of the hardcore bands on here (Spazz to name one) are just terrible, and what's the ... deal with the Lunachicks? Some of the songs are just noise or unstructured music. A lot of people say the bad songs don't overshadow the good, but I disagree, to me, [money] isn't worth the 15 minutes or so of good tunes, and an extra 40 minutes of .... If I were you, I'd say download the songs from the bands listed above: after all, it wouldn't take that long to download, and you saved yourself [money]. I didn't. Be happy for that."
4,"It's not 'Nevermind The Bollocks!', but it's FUN!","I picked this up for the reason that it only cost [a little bit] at a local record store. I didn't expect much from it considering it is 101 bands doing 30second songs. When I popped this in, from start to finish it was awesome! It's not like all of the songs are revolutionary, but they are all fun, SHORT songs.I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good time."
2,Too short,"The songs are too short, and only a few are decent, NOFX and Bad Religion to name two. Other than that it really is a waste of money because a lot of the songs are just jokes, you will probably regret buying this."
1,It sucks.,"This cd suffers from the same thing all punk rock cds sell. It sucks. Like punk rock itself, this cd sucks so bad it's scary. It's a complete waste of money, like any punk cd. If you want real music, and want to hear people with real talent, go buy a Jay-z cd, or DMX."
5,How good does it get?,"This is fantastic for people with short attention spans. From the hilarious to the irate, there's songs on here for everyone. Bands I hadn't heard of before mingle with some of the greats. The concept of this album is superb."
1,"Not scary, no suspense, no violence","Don't let Tobe Hooper's involvement in this mess fool you. This movie is not scary, there is no suspense, and there is virtually no gore or violence. The plot revolves around a college student who gets a job managing an apartment complex. Strange people live there. That's about it. The plot is non-existent, and there are no chills at all. It's somewhat funny at times, but I think the joke is ultimately on the viewer. Tyra Banks is only in a scene or two. Various fairly well-known performers must have had pressing mortgage payments. Taken as a flat comedy, it rates a ""D"" as a horror flick, an ""F."""
1,Just one minor detail needs to be mentioned...,"Even though the publication date of this book is listed as 2009, it's actually a reprint of a work originally written in 1894, so the information is a little, well, out of date, sort of. Like about a century or so."
1,a bit annoying,"So - i'm looking for a relatively recent synopsis of the geology of north america. Eventually I'm sure I'll find a good one. My search is made more difficult because apparently Amazon has recently scanned a lot of the historical geologic reports made two centuries ago and republished them. This is great! A lot of insight into how the science developed, interesting anecdotes, very cool. HOWEVER when I sort my results by publication date, I really mean ORIGINAL publication date. Though interesting, the memoir of so-and-so's trip west in 1873 and the geological features he observed along the way probably ought not to be listed as published in 2011."
4,I am a Toys R Us kid!,"Literally, they pay my paycheck. hehe.. I had this given to me on a lark this Christmas. It's really a marketing ploy disguised as Monopoly. But the thing is it's a GOOD marketing ploy. They want you to become familar with the new layout of Toys R Us that was completed in 2001, when this game was completed. It's an excellent game however, and really fun for a worker from TRU. I think unless you're a huge TRU fan or you've visited the Times Square store, I would say elect for a different version of the game."
5,I like this one,"This version of monopoly just goes to show you how popular and fun monopoly is. If a store such as harley davidson and toys R us have monopoly games and organizations like MLB, NFL, NHL, and hockey have monopolys its very cool. I think this monopoly proves my point straight. GO MONOPOLY!!! Nathan Ward, age 14"
3,pricey and vague,"For such a small book, this one is expensive. Hall didn't really tell me what I wanted to know; he was too vague. I was expecting more."
5,The most uplifting compilation of gospel music,"If you like uplifting gospel music, you will enjoy this cd. Whether you are a workout maniac or just enjoy praising God, you will want to play this cd over and over again!!! The success of this cd is blessed by the strong and all-praising voices of very talented gospel artists. A must addition for all gospel music lovers who also enjoy working out. You will not be able to wait for the next day to exercise and praise our Lord through music!!!"
4,Works fine for how cheap it is,"I only use the #2 because I cut my own hair and do it all with the 2. It works fine. I do have to be somewhat careful that it doesn't fall off and stop quickly if it does because it doesn't hold on to the shaver super tightly, but it works fine as long as I'm careful. Oh, and it's plastic, not metal."
3,"Good read, but forgettable....","I had watched the film Money for Nothing years before ever reading this book. The difference between the film and the true story is classic example of how Hollywood is afraid of showing the reality of a situation or an unhappy ending. The film version is a total cop-out and I'm actually glad it bombed at the box office because it was not true to the story. Even if the true Joey Coyle lived to see the film (he killed himself three weeks before the theatrical release), he would have been disappointed.The book itself was an easy and quick read (I finished it in about 6 hours), and it was fascinating enough to not at all lose interest in the story itself. My only real complaint is the fact that it's pretty forgettable once you finish it. A sad but entertaining story is well brought to light in this book, but I can see myself forgetting all about it in a couple weeks."
1,Not a lot of substance to this book,"I bought this book after reading a complimentary review online. Unfortunately, this book proved to be a very bland, unentertaining read about an unintelligent, vanilla main character who doesn't even give himself a chance to keep the money that he found.Nothing spectacular really happens in the book; in fact, this probably would have been a better feature article for a second-tier major newspaper.I found the characters very difficult to follow, much less get interested in. I do not recommend this book at all."
3,How to lose $1.2 million in one week,"Some of you may have seen the movie ""Money for Nothing"" with John Cusack. Some of you may even like it. The movie is partially based on the true account of Joey, a Pennsylvania drug addict, who back in the early 1980's caught a break in life. He found $1.2 million that fell off a truck and over the course of a week managed to lose most of it, before getting caught by FBI. Apart from the incredible luck this man had, nothing else is much interesting about what happened with him. Readers of the book will find out the numerous stupid choices he makes in an effort to keep the money.Bottom line - the book is interestingly written, but the story is ridiculous and doesn't deserve the time it takes to read it.- by Simon Cleveland"
4,Feel good read,"A well researched and written quick read. Definitely not fiction as there is no way you will believe any of the story if it were made up, but of course it is all true. Also you will definitely feel better about yourself when you read this one as there is NO WAY that you could screw up finding a substantial pile of money worse than Joey does."
3,a good quick light read.,"very entertaining but a little short for my taste. being a fan of Mark Bowden brought me to this book and I'm glad I read it, but honestly I should have bought it at half-price books."
4,Good reading at the beach...,"I actually read the entire book in a few hours while sitting at the beach in Gulf Shores. While it does not have the depth of Bowden's other work, it was a fun read. The main character, Joey Coyle, is an idiotic junkie who manages to piss away huge amounts of money over a short period of time. I laughed a few times and couldn't generate any sympathy for Coyle as his life spun out of control. The best part of the book will be your own daydreams as you wonder what you would do with $1.2 million."
3,not really that great,This book is the worst of the 4 Bowden books I've read. It's mildly entertaining and much too short. It seems like there really wasn't enough of a story to turn it into a book. If you want something short to read it's alright I guess.
1,To be read in one sitting (if at all) because you may never pick it up again...,"A detailed chronicle of a lost soul that finds a million dollars yet still can't find himself. Bowden assembles the pieces of a pre-fabricated story that simply isn't worth a writer of his talent.Never quite earning your sympathy or even your hopes for a happy ending, Coyle settles for your pity... but fails in earning even that. Is it a greater tragedy that opportunity goes unfulfilled or that such opportunities fall where no other outcome is possible?The story never manages to raise itself above the status of neighborhood lore, belonging somewhere on the shelf next to Rocky V in the annals of Philadelphian history."
3,"It's okay, but...","installs easily and works well if just trying to print. I am using it as a hub to 3 computers and for the most part it does what it says. On the downside, the printer is an HP Officejet All-in-One, and the hub does not work well with the HP software with regard to electronically faxing or scanning when switching between computers. More often than not, I get a communication error causing me to reboot the computer and the printer. I'm thinking of spending the extra cash and going full wireless for full functionality. If you just want to share a generic print function, it does do the job, and is a low cost solution."
5,"Perfect, Low-Cost Printer Sharing Switch","By having both big LED buttons and easy-software, the 4-Port USB switch worked great with four non-networked PC's (or four networked PC's needing to share an inexpensive, non-networked printer). It would have worked (without software) with four Linux or four Mac computers just as well. This is a useful device. BTW the buttons are compatible with the switching software. As a result, no training is necessary for the people with whom you work."
1,"OK switch, awkward cables, unacceptable software","I wanted to like this product. It did hook two computers up to a printer for me, and it works as a manual switch (as others have noted, automatic switchers are impractical for USB, because there is no defined start or end to a USB transmission).But the unit has some big strikes: The ""in"" and ""out"" cables are on different sides of the device, which makes for awkward cabling no matter how you use it. The software driver does not mitigate the dreaded ""you have removed a USB device unsafely"" Windows error message, which happens each I switch the switch. Beyond that, the software driver status regularly gets itself out of sync with the switch. In part to solve that, the manual goes to great lengths to tell you to disable all your energy savings settings in the operating system. That, quite frankly, is unacceptable in a world with global warming."
3,K&N quality and saves money over paper filters.,"I replace the paper filters in my vehicles with these. With the price of paper filters getting higher, these pay for themselves quicker. Unit comes pre-oiled and ready for installation. Some will say it lets more dirt in, well that debate goes on.Allows for easier breathing of your engine and usually results in better fuel economy. This one is in a Mercedes 300D. It did increase the intake noise of the engine, not a good thing on an already loud diesel. But could be a plus if you want the noise.Do not let the local service shops over oil these things. Many shops will try to oil these with every engine oil change. These only need oiled every 50k miles or so.Get these for all of your vehicles.Warning, some motorcycles do not like these. Also, if over oiled, they may crud up your mass air fuel sensor. The sensor will then need to be cleaned before working well again."
5,SOMETHING NEW,"I was lucky enough to Language Room perform live in Houston. They are by far, one of the best bands I have seen in a really long time. I have been listening to this album religiously for almost 4 weeks. Would have paid twice as much for the album!"
5,Great Book,"Great book! What else can I say? Timeless principles that can change your perspective on life, work, family and friends. Charge ahead and go cow tipping."
3,Rhinoceros redundancies,"The encouragement to be who you are is very good, but the continual rhyming rhinoceros rhefences were rhedundant andbecame laborous very quickly."
5,Absolutely Terrific,"""Rhonoceros Success"" was given to me by a close friend and I am grateful that this book fell into my hands! This book is jam-packed with life lessons that ultimately guide you toward prosperity and abundance in all areas of life. It clearly charts out the path of success and if you heed the recommendations, wealth will surely follow. I especially enjoyed the part about happiness. Since everyone chooses their own state of mind, choose to be happy and you will be happy! That alone is a simple concept that has very powerful ramifications (positive) if you make the choice. Treat yourself to success and buy this book ASAP!- Dr. Matthew J. LoopAuthor of ""Cracking the Cancer Code"""
2,A corny book making an attempt to motivate,"A strange little book about ""charging ahead. It has basic principles like having a belief in God, no debt, positive attitude, and an ""attitude of success."" It's all about having momentum in whatever you do. The message was clear: don't be like everyone else and have a ""winning"" attitude."
2,Written for cows...,"Rhinoceros Success is a fun, odd little book with the basic philosophy of ""full speed ahead!"" for life. While that sort of simplicity can be refreshing sometimes, it can also become glib very quickly. The author, Scott Alexander, preaches this 'take no prisoners' attitude throughout the book, touting it as the surest path to wealth and success. However, there is no discussion of the ethics, personal sensitivity and discretion necessary to the success of even a ""Rhino."" The book is the notable effort of a fresh college grad, but it's neither deep nor thorough. Another reviewer had the right idea; stick with Wallace Wattles or Napoleon Hill for books on prosperity and success."
5,GET THIS!,"Information is As relavent today as it was then! I went out and purchased a rhino necklace after reading this book, oh and the second book. I gobbled up this book in one sitting! AMAZING, most motivational book i've ever read (i've read quite a few) certain authors appeal to certain people THIS AUTHOR APPEALS TO ALL. There is a very slight christian insertion maybe 3 pages of the entire book, but it does not affect the books quality or impact. If your a christian, you'll love it that much more; if your not, it's as easy to skim over."
5,Buy The CD!!! The Troops Love it!!,"I feel This is one of the best CD's I have heard, I seen Trudy Perform this song Friends Prayer, and when 1000's of people from the 9-11 Stand and salute, with lighters, and an autograph line extends for hours, I salute her!! I am a Judge and I never even knew who she was married to, and frankly I don't care but that has nothing to do with her popularity and If I was Trudy Andes I would file a restraining order on the X-wife that deframed this young ladies character. Along with filing a Slander suit, as in this country we have rights, and that is clearing against the law for someone to purposely harm someones business and character in this fashion, by stating false accusations, and never purchasing a CD."
1,Not Good!!,"Well, honestly, I don't think there's anything special worth mentioning about this album. Trudy's voice is very untrained and she doesn't quite hit the notes right on most if not all of her songs. I'm not suprised at all."
5,The Girl has CLASS!!!,"From a Record Producers stand point, this CD is a must buy!! I bought the CD ""World Tour Live"" All I can say is ""The girl has Class"". She is a great singer, songwriter, and beauitful to look at. I am a very strong critic of music. I bought it, I like it, I recommend it!!!"
1,A real waste of time.,"The author waited 2o years after he left the Mormon Church to write his expose. Other than the first two dozen pages of his personal history, there is nothing new or original about this book. He repeats what most other anti-Mormon books claim is ""The Truth,"" but is really just the same old pack of questionable assertions. This book is a real waste of time."
1,Bad!!!!!!!,"This is one of the most boring videos I've ever seen. Don't waste your money or time to view it. Instead, see a Fellini-directed movie rather than one ABOUT Fellini!!"
3,Decent melodic D&B,"This is a nice little album which will undoubtedly go overlooked, largely because its beats are softer and hardly even imposing. In the world of D&B, I gather, this would be akin to a crooning kitten among a pride of lions. Nice sweeping waves and bleeps actually seem to take a stab at musical continuity, which is too often drowned out by that gee-darn thumping of the elite. This is better than that, but it's no standout."
5,A Powerful and Emotional read,This book has really opened my eyes to the devastating effects of this disease. I personally do not have the illness but know many that have it and reading this book has shed light to an area that is shrouded in darkness and denial. There were many moments when I was moved to tears. I highly recommend this book as an educator and as one way to understand the suffering.
1,An OK book needing major revisions.,"I was very excited that someone had decided to write on these cars but was very disappointed in what I found here. There are numerous miss-identified photos and text errors, page 6 showing a photo specifically stated to be a ""ponton"" but in fact a 300a ""Adenauer"". Something so obvious going unnoticed is not a good start. The errors reach a fever by the time we reach the W114-115. Additionally numerous non-standard cars are used as illustrations that will confuse the unaware. As a long time collector of these cars I could only suggest this book if one has enough knowledge to know when it is wrong. I have dozens of automotive books that I lend out and I will not let this one out because there are so many errors. Lastly, the author has a strong pro-British car bias, understandable in light of where this book was published, but it is clear he does not care for his subject. I am no relation to the author."
1,"This is for leaning, not for sitting for long periods","This stool is essentially an enlarged bicycle seat. Contrary to the product description, there is NO back support. The company I work for (a large website named after a river) requires its fulfillment center employees with desk jobs to use these stools. Since I am short and my feet don't touch the floor, I have a specially made step stool on which to rest my feet. How's that for high-tech? These stools are a nightmare: they may serve a purpose, but it is NOT to sit at a computer for 10-12 hours a day."
1,eCommerce nightmare....,"Greetings, the Safco Taskmaster is only good as an item to lean against. Using this pseudo-stool as a chair at a workstation can be dangerous due to the teeth that hold the seat to the frame can bend and have broken at the facility I work at. Namely amazon.com's Newcastle distribution center. Due to certain ergonomic issues sitting at a taskmaster for prolonged periods will reduce productivity. While increasing risk of lower back injury. There are many good choices for seating at an elevated workstation but this item is not one of them."
1,Im sliding off this chair,"Despite this being the ugliest chair on Amazon I decided to purchase it hoping that it would be the perfect companion to my standing desk. It isn't, unless it's meant to make me stand, a task it is great at accomplishing.I literally slide off the chair when I sit on it. I'm trying to figure out who designed something so stupid. However since tigersupplies took 2 weeks to ship the damn thing I can barely walk and this piece of crap serves as a convenient way to sit for at least 15 seconds at a time. I initially thought, ""hey a luxury stool that costs more than the desk ... This must be good!"". Boy was I wrong :("
4,R&B Brilliance!,"David James Jr. is a sleek singer,...and Curtis Marolt along with Paul Wolf are top notch producers and songwriters! End of Story! Buy it and have the women in yer life love you a little bit more."
5,Beautiful!!,I purchased this as a gift for my god daughters 4th Birthday. I used it as a cake topper. Everyone thought it was beautiful even the Birthday girl.
4,Great Compilation,"This CD features 13 different guitarists heard in selections taken from their Concord albums. Herb Ellis appears three times and Joe Pass twice (including their joint exploration of ""Seven Come Eleven""); the other fine bop and swing-oriented players include Laurindo Almeida, George Barnes, Kenny Burrell, Charlie Byrd, Cal Collins, Eddie Duran, Tal Farlow, Freddie Green, Barney Kessel, Remo Palmier and Howard Roberts. Overall this is a nice sampler but it would be preferable to acquire the complete sessions instead.That being said, getting this CD, if you're not familiar with many jazz guitarists, it's a great way to find out who you like & get their CDs."
3,A Mixed Bag,"This CD has some excellent cuts. Particularly exciting-- Kenny Burell's ""La Petite Mambo"", and the live Joe Pass/Herb Ellis ""Seven Come Eleven"". There are also some really dull cuts here that aren't worth a listen. I picked up this CD very early in my jazz listening, hoping for a ""Who's Who"" in jazz guitar, but this hardly represents what's out there. Yes, you get greats like Pass, Ellis, Burell, Freddie Green, Tal Farlow, and Barney Kessel, but not necessarily at their best, and thrown in are second rate players like Charlie Byrd (sorry to offend any Aquarius fans)."
3,Not what we thought,Went to see the Beat Daddys and bought the CD. But was really disappointed because of too many horns and background voices. I just want plain blues and none of the back up sound. They need to just play the blues and forget the rest.
5,A great detective thriller!,"Brad Stratton's first novel, ""Colored Waters,"" clearly indicates that he is a major writing talent. He has combined an exciting detective mystery with an action thriller, and it's easy to see how this book could be turned into a great movie.The book's hero is the detective Michael Chambers, whose age is never given, but is old enough to be very practiced and knowledgeable in many areas, and young enough to attract the ladies and manage some pretty skilled physical feats. He's also quite witty, which keeps the story appropriately light at times. The mystery begins when he gets an assignment from a Hollywood mogul to figure out who is blackmailing him, and it quickly turns into a much more sinister entanglement with Los Angeles's criminal underworld. I can't tell you more, but it's definitely a page-turner!It's too bad that Stratton isn't more widely known, but I for one am looking forward to now reading his second novel, ""White Lies."""
1,Poor Condition,"The Gardenia Scrapbook, although the design is beautiful, the craftsmanship was poor. The minute I opened the package, the pages were falling out of the book. I am very disapointed with this product and as a result I would like a refund and recommend it to no one."
3,Is it just me or is the reverb excessive?,"Of course this is an overdue accomplishment. But I've noticed an inordinate amount of reverb in many of the songs--especially in the piano part--which negatively affects the blending and the richness of the sound you would get if there were less ""highs."" It often sounds like it was recorded in a vast, empty auditorium. With respect to recording quality, Dietrich Fischer-Diskau's and Gerald Moore's recording of Schubert's lieder is far cleaner and richer. And those two are generally more compelling in their interpretation."
3,Concur in Full,"I concur in full with the previous review of this marvelous collection. The liner notes, photos, and additonal information from Graham Johnson in the original individual discs were the best I have ever read. I have about a dozen of them. I was sorely disappointed to find in the big box only a small-print version of the songs, convenient in one place, but without the splendid commentaries. Bring on the bukly reprint!"
5,Don't Buy!!! (Review Edit),"Vyco is simply the best. The material is perfect for just about any use and you will not be disappointed. I purchased it to use on top of my glass desk and the quality of this product is top-notch. Its very easy to cut to your specifications and to apply, just get some double-sided tape and your done. Its just that easy and I highly recommend this product.By the way, this sheet comes with some instructions to prep it before cutting and just follow them and you will not have any issues. Basically, you just have to lay it flat for 24 hours.EDIT TO MY REVIEW: After using this product for a few weeks, I realized my initial review is completely wrong. Don't buy this product or from this company. After normal use, its starting to stain, fad, etc. I contacted both the manufacture and company who sold me this product they refuse to help me out in any way possible. Basically, this product is extremely bad and don't waste your money. You will be disappointed big time!!! Just crap!!!"
4,This CD is a bit under the ordinary,"it seems as if every new CD good riddance comes out with get's worse. However this is in no case a bad cd, I think it's great and a step up into grazing the hardcore genre. I love good riddance and can not criticize them so by this cd"
1,Not Really Searchable,I am looking for a kindle searchable English thesaurus (like the kindle default dictionary) but this one does not have that functionality.
3,too much,"What I really needed was just the knob & base male connection, so I had to unscrew the end piece and throw it away."
3,Anything but Ordinary,"The Ordinaires are a group of six guys and three girls playing bugle, violin, tenor and alto saxophones, clarinet, trombone, flute and congas. They're trained classicists, and this CD is a sampling of their unique instrumental approach to circus marches (Imelda & Hope), freeform jazz (Brenda) and rock (Kashmir). Seriously folks. The eye opener is the Bonham-Page-Plant composition `Kashmir.' At just over six minutes, this Indian flavored rock composition owes more to classical sensibility than it does popular music. It is as spellbinding as the original Led Zeppelin release, and the silent breaks are heart stopping. The Ordinaires are anything but ordinary."
5,Birds love it....Me too! (after),My experience at first was negative..birds could not figure this thing out.I finally put some plastic wall screw anchors (the plastic u put in walls after you drill a hole) into the space to create a little more space for the birds to peck and get at the sunflower seeds. After I did this the birds use this feeder as their number one place to feed. My wife loves the fact that you can see the birds on all sides of the feeder at the same time. Birds took a while to figure out..but once they do..this will be your favorite feeder. I got the 6 quart model...and am glad I did...dont have to fill too often.
4,Nice feeder,"Very sturdy and easy to assemble/disassemble. Definitely need to use a swivel hook to hang this, though! Excited to use it, I hung mine in the wind & within an hour, it unscrewed itself, came apart, & went crashing to the ground. Had it hung from a 2nd story deck, & it didn't break, though. Have a swivel hook now... no more problems. Can't say whether birds can figure out how to use it easily or not yet. Mine's only been up a few days."
5,Beautiful mouse pad,Love this mouse rug. It is so easy to use and looks fantastic by my computer. Other types of mouse pads seem to stick and look dirty. This one doesn't. The best part is the rug itself does not shift around.
5,"Pretty quilts, fun to do!","I enjoyed reading this book and am now making one of the quilts. The instructions are good, the illustrations are colorful, and the quilts are neat! This book isn't just for beginners. Advanced quilters would find it just as fun. The four quilts are: At The Seashore (a scene with ocean, fish, boats, shells), Peaceful Night (a scene of houses on a street), Checkerboard Floral (a design of blocks with roses, starflowers and tulips), and Through the Seasons (a design of blocks with snowflakes, flowers, pinwheels, suns and leaves). Each one will be like a masterpiece and you'll have fun doing them!"
5,Looking forward to the next book!,"This book was one that had characters that you could relate to. In my reading, I felt like I was living right along side of Aubrey and I was on the adventure with her. This is a book that I am definately recommending to my friends who read and I am looking forward to the second and third books in this trilogy.Amber D. Anderson"
1,Not What I Hoped It Would Be,"My initial excitement over this book quickly turned to disappointment. Being a priest and a member of a religious order I thought it would be great to read the memoirs of a priest my own age. However, I found very little insight in the book. It seems to me that Father Beck goes to great lengths to tell us about the people in his life yet he reveals very little about himself. Even his musings about God and spirituality at the end of each chapter seem shallow and condescending. Perhaps the writing of memoirs is best left to those who are well seasoned."
5,truth sets one free,"there are many complicated issues facing priests, brothers,sisters and lay people today...what Beck does he faces the issues directly and says what he honestly thinks, THIS IS SO REFRESHING , AND HAS THE RING OF TRUTH. I liked especially his experience in Peoria and how he dealt with it in a mature but painful way. Similar situations are going on in many parishes today and all of us need to stand up and be counted.Also his experiences with cancer patients is deeply moving, especially the cancer of his mother...good read, it kept me up all nite."
2,I don't get it,"Perhaps it's because I'm not Catholic (though I am a Christian) and therefore don't rever priests, or perhaps I was looking for something a little deeper, but I just didn't find a thoughful priest writing this book. The little stories with their Sunday school endings, the misplaced angst, and the name dropping of Carly Simon just don't rise to the level of suggesting that this is a man on a difficult spiritual journey. While I can appreciate his continued questioning of the demands of his calling, that is part of the maturation process, not necessarily unique to a priest. I felt cheated by the time I finished this book, for I have known Catholic missionary priests who've lived hard lives who would find absolutely nothing in common with Fr. Beck. I think he thinks he's wasted his life and this is his apology for it."
2,disappointingly uncreative,"I bought this book to use in teaching an undergraduate course on John's gospel. The premise was promising: a feminist reading of John's symbols that didn't pit women vs. Jesus/God/the Bible.I was greatly disappointed. Much of the book summarizes traditional scholarship without much critique or creativity. The book could use some substantial editing: it is redundant and just not very well written. And in the end, the author barely delivers on the premise.The best parts of the book were near the ends of each chapter when she engages other feminist scholars who overreact against the very real oppressive reality of patriarchy by throwing out the while Bible."
5,Should last a lifetime.,"Great measuring spoon set, which I use without keeping them clipped together as they are easier for me to handle that way. (I keep them clipped together when returning them to the drawer where I store them. The clip that came with the set I bought is hard to open and close but should loosen up over time, and maybe a shot of WD-40 will help. Otherwise I'll find something else to keep the spoons together when they are stored.) There are cheaper sets made of plastic and cheaper metals, but this set is reasonably priced for its high quality. The measurements are etched into the handles and therefore won't rub or wash off the way measurements stamped or printed on the handles of some plastic measuring spoons do. These attractive, practical measuring spoons should last a lifetime."
1,Rusted,"Seemed like a good set. The straight-sided spoons can be used for leveling. The clip is easy to undo so the set can be taken apart for use and put together for storage.However, the first time I used them I left them in a cup of water overnight and the 1/2 tsp totally rusted. So much for ""stainless"" steel."
3,The Gypsy antique dealer hunts down a murderer.,"I enjoyed this early Martin Cruz Smith mystery. The main character, Roman Grey is fascinating in many of the same ways Smith's later heroes are... quiet, humble, competent, quick, enigmatic. As with his later novels, Smith gives some interesting information about a group of people that the mainstream U.S. doesn't usually think or know much about; in this case, gypsies in the U.S. in the 70's, v.s. later novels inhabited by Native Americans, or Russians, or miners. In this case, I think the circumstances of the Gypsy are sometimes more interesting than the story itself. Not that the story is dull. But I found some of the plot to be a bit stretched.Martin Cruz Smith is a fantastic writer, and I'd like to hear more of Roman Grey, though I don't really expect we will."
3,"Fascinating material, but ultimately collapses","Martin Cruz Smith has a real knack for rooting his stories within really fascinating backgroups. The Russian police in GORKY PARK, bats in NIGHTWING, the development of the Bomb in STALLION GATE, etc. etc. This very early novel of his is no exception. We get to delve into the life of an American Gypsy, something few of us have any background in. And we learn a lot about antique furniture, which I never thought I'd be interested in, but it was so well done, I found myself quite drawn in.But the actual plot, the mystery, if you will, is pretty thin, and quite frankly, the ""final showdown"" is really not very good. There's a lot of stuff with ""hippies"" that seems painfully dated today. The book is a must for people who read Smith avidly, as I do, but I wouldn't recommend it as a starting point for delving into Smith (just plunge right in to GORKY PARK for that), nor would I recommend it to the casual mystery reader, because the mystery itself is not much."
2,"Well, you can tell this is his early stuff!","Martin Cruz Smith is literally my favorite author. So, when I found an copy of this at a flea market I was overjoyed. However, after reading it, I'm kind of wishing I wasn't so lucky. The book has a quirky sarcastic lead, like Arkady Renko, but beyond that there are little to no similarity to the Renko series which is utter gold. This is a just a writer learning and perfecting his craft. Just part of the process but sadly, a part I could have skipped."
5,GREAT THINGS DO COME IN SMALL PACKAGES !!,Passage to Liberty is a MUST HAVE for any person of Italian Heritage. Although this book is small in pages (32) it more than makes up for in content. My heart was full of joy and at the same time sadness reading this book as it made me think about my Grandparents and all The Italians who came before us to make a better life for the rest of us !!
2,It's ok,"Son just had to have another one since the other wheels broke off. So we got another for Christmas. Well the quality of plastic is quite thin and the ""rubber"" on the wheels seem unable to stay on. It's a clumsy toy. Open and closing the ramps is hard and you need to be pretty coordinated to work it.All in all I give it a poor review twice."
2,Maybe it was just the one I got....,Had issues collapsing the ramp and in general lots of trouble using it. My son still liked to play with it but every time he would try to close it it would sound like it was breaking. The button underneath was useless. Also I threw away all the cones because of choking hazard for younger brother.
5,food to keep brain alive,"IKIRU means to_live in japanese and this beautiful movie is one of the best representations ever of what really matters in life. Facing an incoming death due to a cancer, a bureaucrat who has wasted 30 years of his life doing nothing uses at his best the last 6 months he has in store.I recommend to watch this movie and also read Seneca's ""De brevitate vitae"".Life is really too important to be wasted in the idiot things we are forced to do by the stream that carries us away. It is good to watch a good reminder, as this movie is."
5,A wonderful movie!,"It was sad, but life affirming at the same time. One of Kurosawa's best! Highly recommended!"
3,Overrated,"This 1952 film by Akira Kurosawa, about a civil servant learning he has terminal stomach cancer, and trying to do something socially meaningful in the last months of his life to redeem his boring and uneventful life, has become a bit overrated. Some people had even called this film a masterpiece. The material is certainly moving, but the movie is stilted and static, the performance of the main actor is of one note, and the dialogue explains often what is obvious to the viewer. Realistic movies were not Kurosawa's forte. One cannot help but notice that at about the same time Ikiru came out such directors as Ozu and Naruse were making much stronger, fluid and unmawkish movies dealing with the everyday life in postwar Japan."
1,Somebody has to say it...,"This is a lousy movie. Tedious, badly written and badly (over) acted, with an excruciatingly slow plot and too long by about an hour. The main character is utterly unsympathetic, has about 2 facial expressions, and perhaps it didn't translate well to subtitles but his inability to spit out a complete sentence--mildly humorous when remarked upon by another character--rendered the movie almost unwatchable. The two most interesting and somewhat sympathetic characters play brief roles and then are gone without a trace.A real stumper is why he was able to make something of his life by pushing through a proposal to turn a cesspool into a park, yet was completely unable to find some connection to his son by the time he died. In fact his son (and to a lesser extent his daughter-in-law) plays a puzzlingly minor role in the overall plot."
3,Classic movie but HORRIBLE TRANSLATION!!,"When I saw this movie for the first time a few months ago, I walked out thinking it lived up to expectations. When I bought the DVD, I was very unimpressed...I didnt remember the subtitled translation being so bad! It almost kills the movie. Knowing some Japanese, I could still understand most of what was happening BUT for I felt pity for anyone who was stuck having to read the subtitles. NEW ENGLISH TRANSLATION PLEASE!!!"
5,Marvelous and haunting!,"The last day of a simple man who is dying of cancer , makes for him a real transformation in the values who held him . When he decides to give a surprise to his own daughter to tell her about his illness she captures in a powerful statement where she states she wants he dies as soon as possible .He closes the door and that reason will carry him through the reconsideration about a lot of things .One of the supreme masterpieces of all the cinema story . Many people consider this is the most expressive and poignant work of Kurosawa .I do not agree but undoubtly it is a real gem .Unforgettable!"
4,"Pretty Voices, Catchy Tunes","These lovely tunesmiths make me smile every time I hear them. This new album is a strong collection of well rendered, meaningful pop songs. Listen to it once and you'll find that the harmonies are gorgeous, the instrumentation is strong and engaging, and the lyrics are from the heart. Listen to it twice and I bet you'll catch yourself singing these songs in the shower"
1,Painful toothpaste!,"I have sensitive teeth, so I thought this stuff would be great. I used it for about 6 weeks, and it hurt my teeth more and more every week! It's sitting under the sink, where it will probably stay until I move..."
1,MOUTH SLIME,I hate this toothpaste! It leaves slime like mouth boogers all over my mouth. It can take 10 minutes to get it all out. Pretty embarassing out in public. I threw mine away.
1,ouch!,"tears up the inside of my mouth. I find myself brushing faster just to get it out because it strips off all the layers of skin in my mouth and gives me sores if I leave it in there too long. though the company may claim that it's good to get rid of dead layers of skin and it's just super powerful antibacterial stuff, I actually find myself having yuckier breath in the morning... besides, I can get a nice clean mouth without the mouth pain and dead skin that I get with this sucky product."
1,whoa,"I actually work in a dental office and had noticed the slime after using some of the samples my office recieved. I shook it off thinking it was just a residue left from the tooth paste and stopped using it to avoid the uncomfortable after math of using the product. Just recently a crest and oral b rep brought several full sized tubes to the office for the staff and after my colgate total (which i loved) ran out I started using the free pro health I got from our rep. Bad idea I started noticed the slimy film in my mouth again and actually took the time this go around to google it only to find out its not a residue left behind from the paste, but the skin in my mouth peeling off?!?!! I was mortified and ill be sure to discuss this with the doctor and have our office no longer recommend this horrible product."
1,Yuck,I got this with the free mouthwash and have been using it for a few weeks. The gritty feel is weird but it is the aftertaste that I hate. It seems to hang around for hours after you brush. I would never buy this again.
3,More for your gums than your teeth.,Decent product. A lot of people are complaining about the staining from stannous fluoride. Doing some research you see that stannous fluoride is a very powerful anti-bacterial agent that really does help getting rid of the bateria that causes gum disease. I've talked to dentists about the stains and it is easy to remove in your regular cleanings. They are right they came right off on my cleaning. I've also found it seems to stain the plaque on your teeth and not your actual teeth (but I'm not sure about that). Bottom line is if you have issues with your gums I would throw Crest Pro-Health into your routine and possibily rotate it so you lessen the staining. However I would like to point out that I have not had that much staining from it. But the fluoride might be causing a bitter aftertaste in my mouth. In the end...$4.00 for this toothpaste is a much better deal than $20 for the prescription stannous rinses.
1,Awful,"I used this toothpaste for a couple weeks. It left the inside of my mouth feeling numb and dehydrated. I also got big gobs of disgusting slime in my mouth each morning. Initially I blamed a new toothbrush, but from the rest of the reviews I think I can conclude this was another side effect of the paste. Yuck."
1,Unctious Slime,Using this product make my mouth slough-off into some kind of discussing unctious slime that is hard to remove. A new kind of adhesive?? Don't buy this product unless prepared for this effect.
1,Worst toothpaste ever,"After brushing, it causes the inner layer of skin inside my cheeks and inner lips to sluff off. It feels disgusting and disturbing. Not only that, but it leaves an awful aftertaste, which ruins the flavor of food for several hours. And it leaves my mouth feeling tortured and slimy rather than refreshed and squeaky clean. Love Crest. HATE Crest Pro-Health."
1,Ouch,"I've tried using this for 3 days in a row, and each time, it hurts my teeth like hell. I thought I just had really super sensitive teeth or something, but looking through the other reviews, I see I'm not the only one with this problem. I switched from Sensodine Whitening, and never had that problem before."
1,Stannous Fluoride stains your teeth and slouthing of the mouth,My Dentist gave me a sample of Crest Pro-something can't really call it health. I read the ingredients and even the statement on the box says that stannous fluoride stains your teeth. After reading the reviews I'm definately avoiding the mouth slime and teeth staining. If you have to go to the dentist to get it off of your teeth per the other reviews it isn't worth it. I'm not waiting until I get sloughing of the mouth just like Chemotherapy that also cause slouthing of the mouth. I wonder if I can throw it in the trash or is it considered hazardous waste.
1,Terrible Toothpaste,"Had a coupon to purchase 2 of these for the price of one, brought 2 tubes home. 1 and 3/4 of the tubes are now in my county land fill. Plaque build-up increased, teeth did not fill as clean, and the stuff left my mouth feeling uncomfortable (weird) and painfully sensitive to cold liquids for 1 or 2 hours. Not something I'll purchase again in this lifetime."
3,Leaves mouth feeling really clean.. but yuck.,"I'm pretty sure it's not slime that the toothpaste is leaving in your mouth, but the dead skin cells from the inner lining of your cheeks. Yes, I have experienced this almost every morning and I've been using this toothpaste for several months now. I'd be hard pressed to find a toothpaste that leaves my mouth feeling cleaner, but I can't stand having to take a tissue and wiping the inside of my mouth everyday. Time to find something new. But once again - it's not toothpaste slime, it's your mouth slime!"
1,Gross and destructive to your mouth/lips!,"As others have said, this toothpaste really tears your mouth apart. Not only does is have a slightly off taste, it does a number on your mouth and lips. I too have experienced the thick filmy white stuff coming off of the inside of my mouth - it's disgusting to pull out. I've also experienced a lot of burning of my lips while I brush and I've noticed that they are very chapped. I have, as of today, discontinued use of this terrible product. I don't care if it's good for my teeth - loosing the lining of my mouth is NOT worth it!"
1,Destroys the taste buds!,"Initially I loved this stuff. My teeth felt clean and I didn't get the staining. BUT...aside from the fact that it kills an entire layer of skin cells inside your mouth every time you use it, and that the FDA seems to let a lot of bad stuff slip into the retail market, and that we have no idea just how much 'bad stuff' is being absorbed through your oral mucus membranes into your system every time you use this stuff...after a while you completely loose your sense of taste! That's great for dieting, I admit, AND I want my teeth until I'm 100, but there has to be a better way! The loss of taste is a well known side-effect of the Pro-Health Mouthwash!"
1,destroys your mouth,"I constantly have canker sores all over my pallet, gums, and tongue as well as the slime everyone is talking about! Terrible product, I will never buy this stuff again."
1,Agree with everyone else! HORRIBLE!!,"I was getting gingivitis from using Organic, all natural toothpaste, so against my better judgement, I bought ""regular"" toothpaste and tried Crest ProHealth. Well, for about the 4th time since I started using it, my mouth became very raw and painful. I thought my tongue was burning while brushing my teeth b/c of whatever ""rash"" or something, I had. HOW could I not realize that it was the toothpaste causing it???? My mouth hurts so bad and I didn't enjoy the food at a wedding today because of it :(I will never buy this crap again, or any other Crest product!!!!!"
1,Stains teeth,"After using this product for four weeks, I developed terrible brown ""stains"" - actually, some sort of brown deposit, on my teeth. I tried whitening products, but nothing would take those stains off. I was at the dentist today. Both the dentist and the hygenist told my that Crest Pro Health caused those stains. It took the hygenist an entire hour to get them off of my teeth. This product should be pulled from the shelves."
5,Ooh La La!,"Care to Tango? Cha-cha? Fox-trot? Rhumba? Swing? Dan Newton's Cafe Accordion Orchestra plays them all. Gotta Dance! Did you dance to their music in Minneapolis? New York? Vienna? Well, if you missed those venues, you can buy this CD and dance in your own living room! So, order this one up and be musically transported to a little sidewalk cafe in Paris."
4,Almost Authentic French Cafe Music,"The instrumental music is wonderful, but when they start to sing it sounds more American than French. The good news it's mostly instrumental."
1,Good in theory but not in practice,"I was super excited to get this line because my research pointed to braided lines being superior. On my first cast I knew I had a different animal all together as the line went out so fast that I almost sliced my finger open. I had to use a glove to for the rest of my trip. The real problems come do to the line not holding knots. I used knots specifically for braided lines and they still slipped. Everything time it would slip a knot I lost not only my fish but an expensive leader as I was saltwater fishing. All of these I could deal with until on the last day (what was going to my last cast) I cast my bottom rig out like a I did all week and I hear ""rip"" and I whatch my $10 leader go flying into the ocean and look down and the line totally failed. I could understand If I have been fishing for 6 months with this stuff as saltwater is harsh on everything but this was 6 days. My mono lines never did that."
4,Great,I purchased this item for my wife and it look very sexy on her. I suggest that you should order a size larger because it's very narrow other wise that two thumbs up
2,Disappointed,"This is the second remote I have purchased made by ""Universal"". The first one (MX500)I was very happy with until my son dropped it for the 30'th time and it finally died. I purchased this one because I liked the look of it better, and the price was about the same. I wish I would have ordered another MX500. The buttons on this one feel cheap when depressing. There is a little resistance, then it clicks down. Not smooth operation like the other. The down button doesn't work every click either. I had to program a different button so it would work consistantly."
5,URC200 Universal Remote Control,"This is a great universal remote at a great price. It is easily programmed, intuitive, and user friendly.I love the enclose DVD where the company President comes on and pretty much says ""Hi, its ok, I know you are electronically challenged, that is why you bought this thing. BUT its ok, you can do it, I'LL HELP! I'LL HELP"". Thank you President guy. It is a good product."
2,The little remote that could't,This is a very limited and basic remote. It has macros but they are irratic and programming them can be tediousswiching viewing sources from satellite tv to lets say dvd viewing will usually just turn everything off. Believe me if you have multipe components and an HD tv this remote will not get the job done. This is starting to make my annoying Harmony remote 880 look good. I have decided to keep it as a back-up
4,Excellent value for a Universal Remote with Macros,"This remote is an excellent bargain in the universal remote arena. I use it to control my HDTV, Surround Receiver, DVD/VCR Combo and my Satellite Receiver. Without it I'm sure my wife wouldn't be able to watch what she wanted. The URC200 has plenty of macros and plenty of programmable buttons to go with them. You can also edit all of the key labels with ease. Additionally, you can learn buttons/codes from other remotes to fill in any missing keys in for the device after programming with the supplied codes. All in all a very good remote and I got it far cheaper than any other comparable remote on the market. Cons are that learning codes takes some time an patience and I had some issues when I used the same name/label for buttons on different devices."
5,Good product for a good price,"This remote does everything I could hope for. Replaced tivo, television, surround sound, dvd, vcr, hdtv tuner and cable box remotes."
4,"Generally Good, But...","I mostly agree with the other reviewers. My only complaint is that it can be a bit difficult to access the most commonly used functions on a given device if you have a longish list of commonly used functions. For example, even after customizing many buttons and menus, I still need to go two levels down to access some cable box commands. This is because I use a lot of the cable box (DVR) commands, and I just ran out of ""hard"" buttons, so I needed to use the ""soft"" buttons. It's a lot of pressing just to ""swap"" or skip back 15 seconds. The real cable remote is actually better suited, as there are just more buttons.I am still trying to get used to using this remote after two weeks. I am using it primarily for cable box and TV. When I am in a hurry, I find myself grabbing the original cable remote.Would I buy it again? Hmmmm.... probably not... but I don't regret getting it.... The backlight feature alone makes it worth the price."
5,The Tragic Treasury: Songs from a Series of Unfortunate Events,"My daughter LOVES these songs and plays them all the time! She is the biggest Lemony Snicket fan ever! -- (the books, not the movie)"
3,"Pretty good, but some are better than others","We bought this because we loved the clip from the audio book of ""The Reptile Room."" We did enjoy that song, but also felt it was one of the better songs on the album. For fans of the Unfortunate Events series, it's probably still worth it."
5,"For Wolfe, Not for Archie","I purchased this as a gift for somebody who loves listening to Nero Wolfe mysteries. He particularly enjoyed this one. I've read the novel a couple of times and liked it very much. I think the title, ""Too Many Women,"" is humorous because even one woman is too many for Nero, but the 500 employed by the Naylor-Kerr engineering firm of this novel are just barely too many for Archie, who is working undercover as an efficiency expert, trying to determine who murdered one of the firm's employees. Archie enjoys meeting all the beautiful women, but he realizes that all, or perhaps only most, of them are not telling the truth. So he counters with lies of his own, in order to trap the killer. This is definitely one of the best of the Nero Wolfe mysteries, with lots of witty dialogue, reversal of situations, the whole cast of Nero's helpers, and a surprise ending."
2,WRONG,"I want my money back. There was nothing new in this book that CNN has not already reported. The dates for some of the attacks are also wrong. The USS COLE was bombed on OCT 12, not the 5th as written by the author. The author must have spent little time on research, it's all cut and paste text."
2,"great movie, but wished they had kept the original overdubs","this film is really entertaining, and it has some great action sequences that are sure to spark your interest. however, in the remastered DVD version, the overdubbing was remastered as well, and the voices used this time around are 100% lame. as someone who enjoys the classic, cheesey-style kung-fu movies of the 70s and 80s, i was very upset by this. it really takes away from the whole viewing of the film. but besides that, the new picture and surround sound seemed really crisp. i just wished they hadn't changed the dialogue."
5,One of the Great Chinese Period Pictures,"This film has everything: intrigue, suspense, swordplay, and flying Ninjas. Lots of flying ninjas. The film is actually very entertaining, and brings up some interesting philosophical issues about honor and dedication to country vs. family. By the way, did I mention the flying Ninjas?"
3,"Old ""skool"" Kung Fu!!","This flick was just o.k for me,,,I'm not one to enjoy kung fu where the dudes fly through the air like birds,,aswell,,I'm not too into swords play,,that killed it for me. The story however, was great,,the fight scenes nicely choreographed. However, don't think I would re-visit this one,,,for me it's just a one time watch!!"
2,A decent but outdated movie,"This is not the worst movie in the world, but it is rather slow at times and has some pretty atrocious acting and costumes. There are a couple of nice fight scenes and the ninja action is out of hand, but these scenes are few and far between. The rest of the time is filled with attempts at arty wuxia drama which just doesn't work. It was one of the earlier ""arty"" kung fu swordplay movies, so it was novel when it was made, but in hindsight, it is just not nearly as entertaining as later classics like Swordman II, Dragon Inn, etc. HK fanboys and collectors should check it out for historical reasons, but casual kung fu fans should check out some of those other mentioned titles instead."
4,To Determine the Greatest Swordsman,Such an awesome martial arts movie with a unique story and twists. I wanted this in DVD format since I only had VHS. Quality is good and I'm glad to have updated and added to my collection!
2,DON'T BUY THE FOX VERSION!!! IT'S SUCK'S!!!,"MAN! Im soo ashamed. The FOX version says that the movie is ""Digitally Remastered"" and it's true, but what they DON'T tell you is that they RUINED the sound effect synchronization!!!!!!!All the sound effects are heard before the action. If you can tolerate this GREAT mistake then you can enjoy this movie, but if you don't, then stick with the original chinese version.P.S: I gave this movie 2 stars because of the dvd quality, but the film itself is a FAST CrAzY ACTION MASTERPIECE!!! It's a shame that FOX didn't saw it that way.Adios."
1,Needs Power,"I purchased this phone to replace an existing 2-line AT&T; wall phone. However, I never took this phone out of the box because the instructions stated that you had use the AC power supply. A call to Panasonic support confirmed this.It would have helped if Panasonic had mentioned that AC was required (unless you want to constantly replace the backup batteries).Unfortunately, there is no electrical outlet anywhere near the phone's location. {Even if there was an outlet, who wants a power cord hanging down the wall?}"
1,misleading LCD feature,"This phone was listed with LCD features but not suitable for my needs.It was shipped by Beach Audio.Contacted Beach to convey my disappointment and return the telephone.I was required to go through ridiculous red tape procedures plus $10.20 shipping and ""required insurance"" I purchased this phone on Nov 17, 2003 and returned it on Nov. 23,2003.My visa was originally billed for $94.85including shipping&handling.I paid a total of $105.50.Until I called today there was no credit on my Visa.BeachAudio is allowing me $79.52. This is highway robbery."
3,2 line corded phone,"As this is a home phone, I have no use for most of the special features. My major complaint is that there is no backlight on the 'caller ID' panel, which makes it impossible to see the name of the caller unless you have a bright light shining on it and you are VERY close to the phone. Unfortunately, I depend on this function to screen my calls. When I called Panasonic I was told this feature does not have a backlight. Disappointing."
5,perfect corded phone,that's all I can say...it is the best and always has been..great sound and great functions!
1,Panasonic flop,"This is the first Panasonic product I ever considered a bad design. Forget the display. Without Hubble eyes, perfect lighting and angle you wont see squat.Line2/data only sends data from Line2 of L1/L2 jack. An answering machine connected to that port (as shown in the manual) will only take calls on line 2. Almost useless.Panasonic help will give you the wrong part number for a workaround line splitter adapter from Radio Shack but, will not send one to you.Talk on line 2, get a call waiting, switch hook (like every other phone in the universe) to take caller #2. Phone switches to line 1, disconnects both callers on line 2.Phone w/caller ID does not flash indicating that a call came thru.Like the other reviews I've read, the number of speed dial buttons is only 3. Not very useful.The few nice features it has are overshadowed by the shortcomings and not worth the money."
4,intercom goes crazy,I have 8 of these phones in my house and they normally work fine. But occasionally one or two of them will go crazy and start beeping like a ghost is pressing intercom buttons. One may start flashing all intercom lights and forget its station assignment. I don't know if one phone is bad or if there is some intermittent noise on the wiring. I have checked the wiring and called Panasonic.And the LCD is hard to read. Otherwise a great phone.
2,Review,Very nice phone with lots of fetures. We had trouble using the phone with our T-mobile home phone service. We ended up returning the product. Probably would have worked well with other phone service.
3,Not with DSL,"This looked like a great phone but I purchased two specifically for the intercom use. When we couldn't get it to work, I called Panasonic customer support as requested in the manual. The only help they offered was to add a noise filter, which all of our phone lines already had. So, after trying various connections we decided it wasn't our fault and I returned them to Amazon and got a prompt refund. If they had stated the intercom feature does NOT work at all with DSL, I would not have gotten them."
4,telephone with speaker,"I had no interest in the intercom feature, so haven't used that. The speaker is good. Unlike some telephones, the audio is very good."
1,Great phone,"I recently purchased two of these phones for my office to replace two very disapointing GE models, as soon as I had them set up, I immediately bought a third for my home. It might seem to be a minor detail, but even the batteries were included. The hands free feature is excellent, programming is a snap and fairly customisable, the intercom is great, it's expandable up to eight extensions, great sound quality all around. I hope that panasonic will make a cordless model that is compatible with this system."
1,Recommended by AT&T Serviceman...Phooey!!!,"I was having trouble with my AT&T 2-line phone. There was an annoying hum in the background on only Line 1. An AT&T repairman came out and checked all my lines and he said it was the phone. He said that AT&T phones were junk and that I should buy a Panasonic phone, ""they're the best."" I purchased this phone and hooked it up and low and behold...there was now an annoying buzz on BOTH lines, loader than on my junky AT&T phone. All I want to do is conduct my home business with clarity on my phonelines. Is that too much to ask? DO NOT BUT THIS PHONE because you will be putting it right back in the box like I did. Now I don't know where to turn. UGHH!"
4,NBA Hoops Comforter and Pillow,My son loves it and the minute it arrived could not wait to sleep with the pillow. We also bought the comforter. The colors and very bright. My son is eight and can not wait to sleep in the bed and his sisters teenage boyfriend is jealous and wishes he had that set.
3,neither fish nor fowl,"author pursued two story lines and really did justice to neither. as an earlier review states, there was no real solution to the murder mystery. I learned quite a bit about Poe(he could have not invented a more tragic character than himself), but might have done so more easily by picking up a biography. Whether I would have done so is another story, so maybe Stashower achieved something here. still feel larson is more successful in weaving together two plots."
3,Interesting but far from spectacular,"This book basically attempts to cover the sort of history/crime nonfiction that Erik Larsen mined so profitably in ""Devil in the White City"" and ""Thunderstruck"" (neither of which is quite as gripping as Larsen's non-crime-oriented ""Isaac's Storm: A Man, a Time, and the Deadliest Hurricane in History."") But Daniel Stashower's effort to link a once-famed/now-forgotten crime and Edgar Allan Poe's career is, alas, only intermittently interesting."
3,"Interesting Book, Needs to Decide What Story to Tell","There are parts of this book that are very engaging and interesting -- life in lower Manhattan in the 1830s and 40s, for example; the beach and spring scene in Hoboken along the Hudson River, the sad and tragic case of Mary Rogers, and of course Poe's life story.But this book fails to find a convincing narrative that links all of these parts together. Instead, the author gets bogged down in side stories, and works too hard to link it all together, not very convincingly.As a result, the book is slow going, and somewhat frustrating. A good editor was needed here."
3,"true crime, biography and history rolled into one","This nonfiction book covers an unsolved murder mystery and provides an interesting view of the time period in New York City. It is also a brief biography of Edgar Allen Poe. Skilled writing makes this an enjoyable read. However, the story begins to drag half way through the book and I found myself scanning large parts. Still if you like true crime this is worth the time."
2,It had potential.....,"This book could have been more interesting with better editing. The same point is repeated over and over again. How stupid does one need to be to get the point of what the author is trying to convey?Poe's story is interesting. The fervor of the press at the time is just like the paparazzi today, so it was interesting to see how little things have improved with tabloid journalism. The reports of the bumbling of the coroner and the police also shows how those departments have been picked on since they came to be.The author either did not have enough interesting material or simply lacked the imagination to fill this book."
3,Beautiful Cigar Girl,"This book was filled with information about NY in the early to mid-1800's and gave the reader good insight to the development of the police force, the crimes of the time and some government issues. A great portion of this story is Edgar Allan Poe writing his comments concerning the Mary Roger's murderer and along the way, there was lots of information concerning Poe, the man, which I was interested in learning about. In many ways, this was a book about his life. Since this is, in fact, about a real person's murder and the detection methods used to discover who did it, it proved interesting BUT I do not especially like ""true crime"" types of books so was a little disappointed because I was reading a genre I'm not too comfortable with."
2,Slow read,"This book read like a bunch of newspaper clippings from a variety of papers published at that time. The author puts forward several theories of who killed Mary Rogers, but they all have holes in them. Best part of the book was about Poe's womanizing and alcoholism."
2,For Want of a Resolution,"Although I found the period writing style interesting and the review of Poe's life refreshing, I was puzzled how the death of Mary Rogers and its coupling with Poe's "" The Mystery of Marie Roget "" really broke any new ground in our understanding of the unsolved murder.Both the police and Poe engaged in an array of theories and speculations regarding the Beautiful Cigar Girl's demise; however, neither was able to successfully deduce who the real perpetrator or perpetrators were. This made for me the reader a conundrum unfulfilled and wholly unsatisfying - thus wondering why the author went to the trouble of writing on this frustrating subject in the first place.Next time I would suggest that Mr. Stashower choose a topic that offers the reader more substance than tone and period atmosphere - one with anactual resolution."
4,"""Nevermore""","Although this book holds itself out to be a review of the grisly murder of Mary Rogers in 1841 New York, it appears to, instead, turn into a biography of Edgar Allan Poe. That's not to say that this is a bad thing, but perhaps the title should have reflected that more than it does. The book is well written, with emphasis on what the newspapers of the time reported. That there is no solution to the murder mystery does dampen the enthusiasm of the reader somewhat, but that's what often happens when dealing with true crimes. I found the atmosphere presented very tangible, and I did enjoy the Poe biography (I've been to his grave in Baltimore), so the book held my interest. Perhaps others, not as interested in Poe as I am, will not find the book as enjoyable to read."
5,Excellent book,"Stashower has done a number of things extremely well here. He's uncovered an interesting, historical true crime murder; he describes the scene so well you can hear the snap of the buggy whip and smell the horse manure in the streets; he's brought in one of the most fascinating characters of the period, Edgar Allen Poe, and he's tied it all together with prose that's as good as is being written anywhere in fiction or non-fiction today. Read it."
2,Acorna's Soul is Shrinking,"The first volume of this series was wonderful - a great story, with great characters, danger, intrigue, romance...well, you get the picture. In the course of her search (in 5 volumes), Acorna has encountered a number of people - very few of them with any socially redeeming value. The few new characters introduced in the later sequels are almost entirely nasties, if not outright villeins. It seems that McCaffrey (or someone) is determined to show that all peoples, particularly those from a venerated past, are mean, low and self-centered, particularly scientist types who really want to either exploit or explore our heroes without their consent. I'm not sure where this is going but I sure hope McCaffrey and her heroine get there fast. Sometimes characters and plot lines have a half life - I believe this one died two books ago and is starting to smell."
5,LOVE this book,"hey there. i had gotten this book as a replacement for one i had lost, and i love this series. i have not finished it yet but i cannot wait to rent out the next book and keep on thru the series. it is just awesome, and i hope they make the books into movies one day. thanks :)"
4,quite exciting nonetheless...,"this series never ceases to amaze me....after the first two novels i couldn't help but continue. although there have been bumps in the road i feel that acorna's search a definite read, especially for those who have read the previous four books. it is a fast read, with alot of twists and turns that keep you wanting to find out what's going on. i thought the ending was alittle cut off, but i guess it just means another acorna book will be gracing the bookshelves in the future. a definitive book concerning the linyaari and their personal history and more informative source to acorna, aari, maati, thaarinye, and company, certainly more detailed and more enlightening. i thoroughly enjoyed reading it. another triumph for anne and elizabeth!!!"
3,A BIT DISAPPOINTED,I love Anne McCaffrey and the Acorna character. But it certainly seems as though her books suffer when there's a co-author. Less action and sooooo much description included that her characters suffer from malnutrition. In some of her co-authored books I could probably tell you which chapters were written by each author. In this one it's not as clear although that may just be my lack of attention. Having said all of that I will not be able to resist buying the next Acorna book--or anything else by McCaffrey!
3,IF IT DOES FIT YOU MUST ACQUIT,"I ordered the Putco window chrome window visor. The system allows you to make sure it fit by putting the year, make, model and style; however, upon recipt it did not fit my 2006 Dodge Ram 1500 ST like the comformatin said it would."
5,Probably the Best Hardcore CD ever,"Its amazing how such a young band can pump out music this beautiful, meaningful, deep, insightful, powerful, melodic.every Song is a winner. and ""End of An Era"" is probably the greatest song ever written. period."
5,Amazing,".hopesfall. is a very talented 5 piece melody-filled hardcore band. This EP is absolutely amazing. Each track is very well done, filled with beautiful melodies alongside some excellent backup vocals. Do yourself a favor and buy this."
1,"nothing fit, I will return the item","the bumper did not fit, so I don't need the westin 97800 universal rear bumper mount kit. no recommendation from me"
2,Plastic is very brittle,My daughter has collected Breyers for years. This Breyer play set is not worth your money. The plastic is too brittle and the stable is designed very cute but not easy to play in the different rooms. We also bought our daughter the Playmobil Stable. Buy the Playmobil it is worth the extra money!
3,"Cute, but not very durable","This is a really cute stable, but it's pretty flimsy. I got it for my three year old and I'm afraid it's days are numbered. Too bad, because it would be easy to make this toy durable and sturdy :("
4,Not for little kids!,"I have been collecting Breyer horses for twelve years now, and the Red Stable was one of my first Stablemate purchases. It is so cute yet authentic at the same time, and the little extras that come with it make it even more realistic. Putting the barn together was easy since everything slides or clicks into place.I believe this barn would be better displayed or suited for older children than younger ones; it doesn't take much effort to swing the stall doors open, and wrenching on them all day long would certainly lead to breakage. As for the horses, Stablemates are geared toward older collectors due to their size and fragility. If you have younger children, invest in Classics- they're not too big or too small for imaginative play."
2,cheap and flimsy,"We bought this last Christmas for our then 5 year old daughter. I was hoping she would play with it a lot, but the roof keeps falling off and the construction seems very flimsy. I guess the roof was made to come off so that you can see inside easily. But the pieces are thin and brittle and although she is not rough with her toys, I am pretty sure it will break soon. Next time I would purchase a sturdy wooden set that you can open up to see the whole thing."
2,Cannot keep this stable together!,"I bought this as an ""entry level"" horse stable for my 4 year old daughter, before going out and purchasing a more expensive wooden stable. I now wish I had spent more money on a more durable stable. My daughters are very gentle with their toys and I cannot keep this stable from coming apart. Doors and windows have already broken off, which is bad enough, but when the actual walls don't stay on, it's very frustrating to play with. I was really disappointed with Breyer."
1,"Parents DO NOT BUY THIS... read, it will make you laugh!","This was our visit to Santa yesterday... my 6 year old daughter looks at him and says, ""I want horse stables, but NOT the ones you brought me last year, they fell apart!!"" and she was pissed!!! And yes, it was this set!! Santa was NOT HAPPY...LOL Don't buy it, piece of junk, get the melissa and doug wooden set instead!"
3,Stablemates Red Stable Set,"Product shipped very late. Its ok, Not easy to get together and keep together. I thought the item would be more stable then it was."
1,SO FLIMSY and CHEAPLY made,"I have never reviewed a product before in my life. But this toy was so disappointing, I had to tell share. My 4 year old is horse-crazy, and Santa brought her this as a very special gift. Santa was under the impression that Breyer is the best when it comes to horse stuff. Unfortunately, when Mom went to put it together, some of the thin, brittle plastic parts actually cracked and/or broke off during assembly. The joints of the barn don't stay joined, the barn doors come off, and as mentioned, the horses don't stay standing up. If all your child wants is to create a horse display, and if you have room in your house for such ""hands off"" displays, I suppose this would be fine. For a kid who likes pretend play, this is worthless."
1,not good,Still cannot get it together right crooked and way to small did not look like that in the picture child does not play with waste of money
1,Terrible,"My girls wanted a stable for their stablemates so much. They were plently old enough to play with this toy carefully. Everytime they went to play with it, it fell apart. The doors wouldn't stay on and the roof pieces wouldn't stay. It is one of the worse toys were have ever purchased other then the Polly Pocket Race to the Mall. Piece of junk that got thrown away. We just purchase the Melissa and Doug Stable to replace - much more pricey but should be worth the money. Wish we had never bought the Breyer one. Good luck."
5,Horse Lover,"When I got this stable for my birthday,I just loved it.The doors and windows are perfect and it is very stable.I have to say it was hard to put together but it was worth it.If I were you I would listen to the good reviews and not the bad."
1,Plastic Junk,Very dissapointed! Made from very cheap plastic. It has to be put together and the cheap plastic is only put together by snapping them in place. Good to only look at at. If played with it just comes undone. I was afraid to sneeze near this item!
1,expensive junk,"My daughter loves horses and received this stable plus the truck and trailer for christmas. I am extremely disappointed in the quality, VERY flimsy, the roof hasn't been on the stable since the day it fell off (the day it got put together) the side of the stable is falling off, the horses won't stand up. I thought it was a little pricey ($25 each) but for a good quality toy, I don't mind spending the money, unfortunately, this is not the case with these toys."
1,Disappointing Quality,"I had Breyer horses as a child, and a very nice wooden stable. I bought this for my daughter and the cheapy plastic pieces don't even stay together properly. The hinged doors/windows broke off easily, and in fact the whole structure falls apart. I wouldn't recommend this toy for a child at all, it is too frustrating to play with."
4,My daughter enjoys it!,"Easy to install. A little flimsy the plastic could brake. My kids are enjoying it & using their imagination. Didn't spend too much money for the gift, that was great. Would recommend only for kids 3+."
3,"Cute, but only suitable for display","My daughter (aged 5 when she received this item, now turning 7) loves the Breyer horses and the Little Red Stable. Unfortunately Breyer is to look at, not play with. The horses do not stand well and several have suffered broken legs. The Stable is made of a very thin, almost brittle, plastic. My daughter is not rough with her toys, and though she enjoys playing with the set, the broken horses and sharp plastic are a put-off. I wouldn't recommend this for enthusiastic play or for portable entertainment."
5,Collectors Beware (You will fall in love!!),"To those serious collectors (such as myself) the barn detail is not good enough for showing, but the detail on the horses is incredible. To those collectors who still play with their horses (such as my self) the barn is extremely well built and durable. The horses legs do not take a beating well, but the other toys included do. I wouldn't reccomend this for kids who still ""eat"" their toys (has small assecories), but it is definetly a nice horse piece to ad to any collection!!"
2,Made in China,"It's made in China, and sadly that says it all. While it's a lovely looking toy, and I'm sure if all were factory assembled with care it would be great. But,the roof on our's doesn't snap properly so the only way to lift it is by the bottom; hardly something for kids. It's nice and fun looking enough that we may exchange it, but I would suggest buying in a store, so you don't have to deal with the wait on shipping if you receive one that's defective like our's."
3,Pretty Nice,"As stated, the stable is not very strong and will not hold up well under continued use and play.Breyer stablemates have just as much detail as their larger counterparts but they are much more delicate. Their little ears and legs are very prone to breaks, even through gentle play. One must always be careful with them.However, a note to those interested in collecting. The two stablemates included in this set are not available any where else. They can not be purchased seperately. Similar models are available, but not in these exate colors and poses."
