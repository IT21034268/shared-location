4,gone too soon,I thought the album was probably her best so far... it was a bit more mature than her last two. I was sooo devasted to hear about her death; it was so unexpected. The beats on the album are very unique and she has such a sweet voice.
4,R&B's best,"The best album of all time equal wit Foxy Brown's ""Broken Silence"". The production is top quality and the lyrics are very meaningful. Top picks are:WHAT IF - awesome rock song, my fave song of all timeI REFUSE - incredibly powerful and meaningful, starts off slow but builds into something dramatic and ... words can't express it, you just have to hear it.EXTRA SMOOTH - cool beatNEVER NO MORE - very important messageWE NEED A RESOLUTION - very exotic, Timbalands vocals really compliment the songSo why didn't this get 5 stars? Read Between The Lines is a little annoying, but is the only track that is less than perfect. Also, you may find that the album isn't instantly likable, it'll take a few listens to get into the groove of it, but once you do you won't get this out of your stereo.Aaliyah will NEVER be forgotten because she left this incredible album for us to remember her by."
5,Really Good beats,"Superly Talented Aaliyah takes takes a more dance like beat in her songs. This 3rd album not only catches the truest essence in her voice, but shows her range as well. I would say that it is truely bewitching, drawing in the listner like a vacume. It is a Cd that you can listen to 5 years from now and still be able to move to it."
3,A REAL FAN WOULD TELL THE TRUTH,"I Was reading some on these reviews about what people are saying about this album, I am a big aaliyah fan and i disagree that this was here best album. It is very sad that aaliyah died but this was not her best work, it wasnt bad, but she has done better. I do like a lot of the songs but One in A Million was the best album she dropped. This album is ok dont get me wrong but the other 2 or much better. For all the true fans of aaliyah they know this album is not all that everyone is making it seem to be and most of these peeps on here only got the album cuz she died, if u was such a fan u would of got it JUST CAUSE not cuz of her passing But anyway............ rip baby girl"
2,eh..I've heard better,I was very disappointed when I heard this CD. I liked Aailyah's earlier work. I liked the songs on the radio. And after hearing all the hype about this WONDERFUL CD I went out and bought it and was so dissappointed. I think Aailyah's voice is beautiful but these songs weren't really that good. To bad this had to be her last works. She could have done so much better.
5,mature aaliyah,"one thing that i noticed is that Aaliyah's music has always been mature, mature in the way of how the music sounds but not only the music but her lyrics. she is not like others that sing about stupid things, she has a unique stlye. this cd is not so much hip-hop but is more of a baild cd even though not all the tracks sound slow. this cd is a great cd to listen to while trying to get some pace and quite, this cd is great to listen to on a low volume. im not saying it's boring im saying it's a great sound to listen to but is not at such fast pase as you might think it would be.this cd has the coolest beat's,they will have you jammin,jammin to cool ""slow"" groves."
5,AALIYAH IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"No1 can deny that!! Aaliyah was and still is the best R&B singer out there and this album proves it. If I could give her more than 5 stars, I would!! I luv the whole album, but if I had to pick favorites it would be ""We Need A Resolution"" and ""More Than a Woman."" Those songs had the best beats; courtesy of Timbaland. He always came up with some crazy hot beat for her to sing to. The beats never drown out her voice like some other artists voices get lost in the beats. It's ashame that she had to die before people realized how great of an album this was and how great of a singer and a person she was also. Not a day goes by that I don't listen to an Aaliyah album and I'm not exaggerating. If you had any doubts about buying this album, throw them aside and buy the CD!! U won't regret it, I promise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Good Aaliyah CD,"I thought this CD was good, it was a ""skip around"" for me, but overall it's pretty good. My favorites are Rock the boat and It's Whatever.......It's her last CD so it would be good to have."
4,jerome,"yo im jerome im writing about aaliyah,s aaliyah album writing about why i didnt give it 5 stars thre,s two reasons however 1st reason:i like a lttle slow sad songs this is just for people um stariaht up [sorry if my spelling is wrong;hip hop 2 reason:um its just a few of the songs were good such as rock the boat,we need a resolution and those were the days this cd is not by far aaliyahs best work but all im saying is it is good not brulliant"
4,aaliyah thank you,"i would like to say to the review yes it,s ture aaliyah was minor artist but she willing to do something that nobody done in a longtime most of today singers are clones aaliyah done something that bandy, mariah, and whoever else you can of won,t do she let the music speak for itself micheal jackson, gloria estefan, and even luther said something that realiy touch me they said today singers get in the way of the music and they don,t allow the music speak for it,s music yo bashed my mom was also bashed aaliyah a while until she saw romeo must die. and for the person who parise whitney houston over she has (Whitney houston) and (Gloria estefan) and (Sade)her idols to thank for."
5,r.i.p Aaliyah ill alwayz love ya music,"i havnt herd the whole album but this iz a ablum that shuldf be treasure cuz my boo aaliyah will alwayz be remeba by me a thug str8 from the street and ill alwayz bump ya muzic, luv ya aaliyah alwayz and 4eva rip aaliyah 1979-2001 luv ya alwayz"
2,Aaliyah minus Timbaland & Missy = very lame release,"I was a huge fan...but with a release like this, I think she will be losing a big part of her fan base...not one hit on this album...."
3,"Eh...not bad r&b, but she had better...","Aaliyah's final album was not bad, however nothing really grabbed me from it. The beat is alright, and it does provide nice ambiance, and I can't think of a particular track that made an impression on me. She still is missed though."
4,Aaliyah RIP,"Aaliyah ashamed that she's gone she was a good influence on everyone she had an amazing voice so she was an great actress in ""Romeo Must Die"" in 2000 she was good very good she recorded a song called ""I Care 4 U"" I really like that song and ""One In A Million"" and ""Hot Like Fire"" and ""4 Page Letter"" and ""At Your Best (You Are Loved). RIP Baby Girl, We love you"
2,I wouldn't advise you buying this album!!,"I have to say that Aaliyah isn't one of my favourite people because I think that her voice is only mediocre and after listening to her album, I have become even more convinced of this fact. I have been brought up listening to well developed singers with excellent vioces, all of which are somewhat naturally talented. Aailyah isn't one of these people. Trust me!! I have listened and listened to this album trying to find that special spark of something that was worth listening to but my tiresome journey has failed (miserably). I wouldn't advise you buying this album unless you were a complete Aailyah fan otherwise I personally think that it would be a waste of money."
4,"the finest women on earth forget halley,j lo,and the rest.","aaliyah close to perfection,what more can i say."
5,AALIYAH IS THE G.O.A.T.!!!!,"This new album self titled AALIYAH is the best CD out right now to me! She came real strong vocally and displayed a diverse taste of RnB. From hype dance singles like ""More Than a Woman"" to soft and sensual ballads like ""I Care 4 U"", AALIYAH is definately the BOMB!!! If you don't have it, you missing out!"
5,"""Aaliyah"", just ordered it from England","I guess you have to do, what you got to do, in order to get great stuff! I ordered ""Aaliyah"" from For Your Entertainment (F.Y.E.), and it arrived from England 7 days later. It also featured ""Try Again"" on it. And the whole packaging of the album was different. It folded out, instead of just opening up the plastic regular case. Now, I cant stop listening to the unique and lovely sounds of Aaliyah's voice. This album is timeless. And so many people are hating saying that this album isnt that good. Well, a lot of people probably expected Aaliyahs younger sound from 1996's ""One In A Million"". She grown up a lot from that sophmore album, and Aaliyah must of had likes varieties of music. So when people bought this album they were a little dumbfounded, just remember that artists do not like to put out the same old material. But back to ""Aaliyah"", the album is amazing, and really deserves 5 stars!!!"
5,The Best,"Of all her CD's this is the best. If you want a CD that will move your soul and make you bounce, this is it."
3,"Average, she had done better before.","Yes, I was one of the ones who purchased this album after she passed away. I had been a minor fan from before, but before her death, I didn't even know she had released an album. Her two albums before this one ""Age Ain't Nothing But A Number"" & ""One In A Million"" were great albums. But for some reason she tried diffirent producers on this album. It's an okay album, not horrible but she had done better before. There are a few catchy tunes. ""Rock The Boat"" is the best track on the album and the albums biggest hit. Also the video that was being shot, when her plane crashed. The other track that is worth a listen is ""More Than A Woman"", both singles were Top 20 but still nothing of what she accomplished before. More than likely, she would of recorded a better album. She is deeply missed and I know her star would of gotten more brighter."
4,"Aaliayh, you were truly an angel......",Aaliyah has the voice of an angel. Her singing is so beautiful. I love Rock The Boat and Whatever. Anything this girl sings sounds beautiful. She will truly be missed by everyone.
5,Sleek & Smooth.,"Aaliyah is my favourite artist of all time. This album is amazingly sleek. The variety in the tracks flows flawlessly from one to the other.Summary: Intelligent, Sleek & SexyBest Songs On Album: We Need A Resolution, More Than A WomanWorst Songs On Album: What If.*****"
1,keepin it real,"Yo she was an o.k. singer, but she was no acter. Her new c.d. was wack and everyone knows that. Just because she is no longer with us everyone feels the need to lie and not keep it real. She was tight nahh I'm lying, she was wack and couldn't write a song at all. I think every hit song was written by someone else. She never did tell the truth about her and R.Kelly, that is when she was tight. RIP---Aaliyah"
2,A disappointing book for such an incredible 3D program.,"The book contains some good tips and tricks and the author seems very familiar with the tools. Unfortunately, the models that appear in the book look very amateurish. This is certainly not a book you would use to show off the capabilities of Amorphium Pro. The author also annoyingly exports most of the models to Bryce for rendering instead of using Amorphium Pro's renderer. How does that show what Amorphium Pro can do? It doesn't.At one point he makes a snide remark that ""Liquify"" is spelled wrong in the program and should be ""Liquefy"". This seemed petty to me, and according to my dictionary both forms are acceptable. The book also doesn't cover texturing as well as I thought it should. Still, considering it is the only book currently available on Amorphium Pro, it does have some handy tips and if you have the money to spare, it is worth a read. At least until more comprehensive and professional looking Amorphium Pro books are published."
4,MoH: Sick Girl,"Super grossed out by bugs even more. I wasn't too sure about this one but since im a huge fan of MoH, I had to get this one too. Suprise ending made me laugh."
4,A really good little horror film,I have not seen all of the series but I was disappointed with the ones I did of the Masters of Horror. That being said Lucky McKee in my humble opinion is not a Master of Horror. This is a good little horror film really well done. A really strange and well told story of a Lesbian entomologist.
5,My favourite in the Masters of Horror series.,"Others may have their favourites, but this one is mine! It has no boring elements in it anywhere, Angela Bettis is superb as the quirky entemologist, even better than her performance as the title lead in ""May"", (another good movie to watch if you haven't already seen it) but the star of ""Sick Girl"", for me, is the cutest little green leaf bug I have ever seen; witness him waving his little arms around as though in a greeting, so sweet! This episode has everything, interest, originality, great sets, great effects, quirky lesbian relationship, and insects; most of all, that sweet little leaf bug, a star in his own right! Delightful.Other good ones in the series, for different reasons: ""Imprint"" and ""Haeckel's Tale""."
3,Bettis was Brilliant!,"This was a good episode-- on the surface a light hearted, tongue in cheek spoof, but once it settles in, it becomes clear that this is a macabre, twisted, bizarre piece.Bettis turns in a terrific performance as an introverted, nerdy lesbo scientist who becomes involved with another lady... uh, and eventually some bug from Brazil plays a role in a menage a trois type deal.If you are into cult horror films with a surrealness, then check this one out. The focus is on the characters and not so much the gore or suspense. A very good entry which would have made 4 stars had it not been for the rushed, punchline ending."
4,"Sick Girl is sick, but fun.",I really love B-movies of all sorts so I was predisposed to enjoy the Masters Of Horror series. This film is another entry in that august collection. It's a twisted take on a romantic comedy featuring lesbians and mutation spawning insects. Lucky McKee is well represented in this quirky little horror/romantic comedy. His previous work (the film May is a prime example) mostly consists of emotionally rending surrealist horror. It's nice to see him going for bigger laughs with this work.
1,"Dull, drawn-out lesbian horror fare not worth watching","Please oh please tell me why anyone would call Angela Bettis an actor? I've seen her in two films and in both she's as stiff as a board and seems to be attempting to channel Frazier's ex-wife with the stacatto vocal delivery.This show is about a bad bug that eats into a person's brain and eventually overtakes them. It's not scary and it's only gross toward the end.Masters of Horror hasn't been all that horrific other than the ""On and Off a Country Road"".Really not worth bothering."
5,GREAT JOB AMAZON !!!,"I had ordered the t-50 staples for my new staple gun and when they arrived the box of staples had come open during shipping and the staples were scattered all over the box in little pieces. I called Amazon and they assured me it would be taken care of. THE NEXT DAY I HAD MY STAPLES !!! Amazon shipped them 'overnite'... Thanks Amazon,...It does not get any better than that :)"
2,Watch the shipping cost,Should of stayed home and bought didnt read discription on shipping cost way more with the shipping cost.
5,Worked fine,I purchased a staple gun as well and it was perfect for what I was doing which was re felting a pool table and bumpers.
5,fine,"good staples were too short for the thick heavy duty job i had this time so got the same thing locally in 3/8, same brand etc; pleased! 1/4 will work on thinner fabric!"
1,Will never buy staples online again...,"I purchased 4 different sizes. They must of gotten abused during shipping. Unfortuneately, I didn't check them for a couple months after they arrived. Every single stick of staples was broken into dozen of tiny pieces. Thought I saved money buying online, but really just threw the money away."
1,Beware,"These staples arrived two weeks afer placing the order. All of the staples were smashed, perhaps due to inadequate padding in the shipment. Essentially, the product was unusable when it arived. I would not recommend purchasing this product online from this supplier."
4,Mystical,"I found the first half of the book put-downable, meaning that I didn't have a COMPULSION to read it. Nevertheless, I kept it with me and was enchanted whenever I was reading. [NB It evoked similar feelings when reading it to Gabriel Garcia Marquez's Love In The Time of Cholera, so if you liked that, you will surely like this]However, as Eva moved out of her childhood, and the character range widened, the book became more and more un-put-downable, to the point where I was reading it walking down the street.Allende is a beautiful story-teller. That you learn about the social and historical background of Chile - unstated, but unmistakeable) is a subtly conveyed bonus.Thoroughly recommended!"
4,MY REVIEW,"Allende's use of magical realism in her book,Eva Luna,is highly redolent of the style of other Latin American writers of the same genre e.g Gabriel Garcia Marquez.However, unlike them,she gives her own unique touch to it,thereby creating sometHing fresh and seemingly new.I enjoyed reading most of the book but felt the end was a bit rushed.That Eva should end up with Rolf Carle was not exactly prefigured.I somehow missed the subtle innuendos and other hidden messages one would expect would lead to both of them coming together.However, Allende's evocation of imagery is stunning and her characters are fully formed and easily recognisable-Rogelio,the Turk,the Turk's wife who kills herself physically after an emotional demise, when her young lover departs.They are all people we see everyday , interact with and talk to.Infact, they are all of us, in a sense."
4,Um...it's okay...,"It's pretty good. I actually picked this up from my sister's bookshelf and it's the first Allende novel that I've read. Honestly, I'm a little disappointed. I've heard she was really, really good and I was expecting something phenomenal. Maybe that spoiled my appreciation for it...or I just picked up the wrong Allende book. Next time, I'll go for ""House of Spirits."""
1,I. Allende books are PITIFUL 0 stars,"As it happened with The House of Spirits nor depth or intelligence in the story is to be found. Some ideas put together at random with a disrespectful (because it`s just hollow and unadvertently made use of) politics background.Reading I. Allende I got the idea, she picks some good-sounding topics from somewhere or someone and applies them both here and there in her stories.She never engages in risky considerations about the characters.Every might-be an interesting beginning to go on working throughout the book is always aborted after a few lines and let alone never to be mentioned again.I`ve got the impression, she just can`t do it."
5,Khalia,"Eva Luna reigns as one of my favorite novels. It simply ooozes tapestry of imagery, adventure, and vivacity. Every year, I read this novel at least once. To hear Eva tell the story of her rich life just exhilarates me."
3,Eva Luna Review,"I enjoyed reading Eva Luna. In comparison with the other books, it did not have the suspense I was expecting. Nonetheless, I truly enjoyed the journey of Eva Luna's life."
5,My Favorite book.,"i love the way Allende writes. she's a master!! this is a great love story. but it's not typical. its not expected. it is epic and it doesn't just limit its focus to two people. you meet many wonderful, crazy characters. what a world she has created. it's like one long dream reading this book."
3,This is the ENGLISH LANGUAGE VERSION,"Do not be fooled by the first sentence being shown in Spanish above (as I was). This is the English language version of Eva Luna, and Amazon mistakenly put the first sentence of the Spanish version by the title. I know this is not a review of the book, but I would like to prevent someone else from making the mistake I did and ending up paying almost the full price of the book in shipping charges to try to return it and get the correct version."
4,Great gift,I bought this for my boyfriend who is a Spiderman fan. He loved it! His only complaint...not big enough. BUT...he uses it every day!
4,Fathers day gift,Ordered this as a replacement for the shiny one they used to sell at universal. It is not as flashy but was a cost effective replacement. Should make Dad happy on Father's Day.
1,no logo,there was no dream-catcher logo on these mats. I had to return them and it's taking forever to get my money back.
1,Not Good!,"This review concerns the original 1955 edition and the revised 1972 edition which is a shorter version of the original. Frank and Joe's friend Tony inherits a collection of curios and immediately a gang of thieves is interested in a couple of medallions that were apart of the inheritance. The mystery of the medallions takes Frank, Joe, Chet and Tony on a treasure hunt to Guatemala. Personally, I didn't find this book very good. I thought that it lacked much action and many of the chapter endings didn't entice me to read more right away. The plot of the book was rather weak and not very creative and it took the Hardys and their friends no time at all to find the treasure after arriving in Guatemala; although, that didn't happen until page 160. While some fans may like this book, it definately wasn't one of my favorites."
1,Stuffy,Published in 1955 - I have never ever cared for this volume and until I read The Mystery of The Aztec Warrior thought it was the worst in the series. To me I always found it a suffocating book and I can't explain why. Tony plays a prominent role in this one and to the books credit at least they encounter the criminals a fair amount and there is a little action. The latter chapters were fairly decent. Its worth reading - once -but honestly compared to the other volumes in my opinion this is among the cellar dwellers. (Almost a 2 Star - but not quite) RATED D
4,What ECD int he USA sounds like!,"This group has been playing together for many years. The sound of the album reflects that. They all sound as if they have a great appreciation for what the other person is doing. They don't get in each others way. The melody is clearly carried along and they have a lot of fun with it. To take these very simple tunes and make them sound this good really is a sign of great musicians. I don't know if people who are unfmailiar with Contra and English COuntry dance will like this album, but anyone who likes this style of music will enjoy it, and it is very musical and melodic, so lots of other people who are turned off by the mixed production and musical qualities of folk albums by other groups, will enjoy this. It is good music played with spirit, skill, style and taste,"
4,Ooops Upside Your Head!,"That cut is pretty much the centerpiece of this sophmore albumalong with the rollor-rink classic ""Steppin' Out"" and thestopping ""Who'd you Call""-how could those tracks go wrong.Wellgrafting them onto an album not nearly as interesting would be apretty good start."
5,Perfect for my front door entrance,This is not your same old wind chimes (not that there's anything wrong with them). The unique look and sound of my Emperor Gong make it perfect to hang in my front entrance way.It can get tangled in a strong wind. But that is easily fixed.
3,A Piece of Art,I love the looks of the Gong as well as the sound. The problem is that it takes way to much wind for the striker to hit the gong.
1,Doesn't gong!,"Have had this gong hanging in 3 different places outside my house...even in the strongest of wind, it doesn't gong. The whole thing blows, but, never does the striker actually hit the gong. Save your money!"
4,"Interesting Design, Beautiful Sound","After seeing these for sale while on vacation over four years ago at a flea market, my wife had to have one. However, being a tourist hot spot, the asking price was beyond unreasonable.. This is where Amazon comes in. We were able to locate this with ease, the price was reasonable and shipping was quick!We hung it on our patio where it got plenty of breeze to keep it singing. It's not a loud gong, as there is a rubber ring around the ""mallet,"" but it's very relaxing to sit and listen to. We got lots of compliments on it. After four years of ownership though, it was time to retire this gong. We live in the midwest, and the weather has not kind. And, although we only hung it three out of our four seasons; the wood was badly pitted and chipped, the varnish was all but gone, and the metal looked as if it had been through battle.. but it was still functional! The sound wasn't as vibrant as it once was, but it held up well."
3,This Isn't About the Story.,"This book is one of those trick-gadget books that people come up with in the hope that it will lead children to explore books and begin a lifetime of reading. The story is quite short and features a a young cowboy pup. There are a few Cowboy Western slang words that younger children may not understand, but other than that the story; which describes the daily adventures of Cowboy Pup is easy to read and understand. Kids love this book, but it's not for the words. They love it for the furry puppy face that is pasted on the end, but through cleverly placed holes appears on every other page. It's a nice book to look at, but without the furry face, it's just mediocre tripe."
4,Did slow down the vomiting,"When I switched my very senior cat to this, he went from throwing up every day to only every once in a while. However, it is hard to get him to maintain a healthy weight on it. I think the method of slowing down vomiting was the larger kibble, so it takes him longer to eat it- so I may try to find a food with a larger kibble and less fat to keep him at a healthy weight and vomiting less. Otherwise I was happy that this product worked as advertised."
5,My cats love it,"I've been having problems with my cat vomiting recently. He scarfs up his food and immediately regurgitates it. Some mornings he'll do this two or three times in a row. Both cats have had dental issues. After research i decided on this one. Both cats love it. There has been no more vomiting. Me, my cats and my carpet are greatful."
5,the best cat food!!,"This is the only dry cat food my picky cat will eat. Plus the vet said his teeth are looking better now that he has been eating it, when I adopted him he had bad tartar/plaque and early gum disease. He has much less hairballs now too! My younger cat eats mostly this dry food. My older cat still prefers his canned food but always saves room for this too."
4,Works as advertised,My 3 cats love this. The larger kibble does get them to chew instead of just gulping it down like the smaller kibble. A big bonus is that the daily vomiting has stopped. I would rate this 5 stars except that I am not crazy about the amount of grain in the ingredients. Other than that this is good stuff.
5,Twice the Quantity for Lower Cost,This is a great product for an older cat with a sensitive stomach. Very few if any hairballs and really helps keep the teeth clean/gums healthy.
4,Suprised,Ive read a few of this author's books and her pace is alittle slow but still an enjoyable read.This book was easy read with just the right pace.I was very happy with this book.
5,Gettysburg Family History,If you want to get a look at family life in Gettsyburg during the Civil War this is a book worth reading. Civilian life goes on in a suprisngly normal fashion. This is one of many books written by civilians and has diary notes of a newly wed McCreary family member.
4,Guilty Pleasure,"OK, once you get over the fact who's singing, you realize this good, catchy pop and a real tribute to a great producer. It's a complete throw-back to New Wave and that's fine by me! It's not deep, or going to change the world, but heck it's just fun that sticks in your head."
4,A Catchy One,"I bought this cd upon its release, having heard that it is a departure from some of Kelly Osbourne's earlier work (Shut Up). Well, it is. And although I liked Shut Up (See other review), I do find this cd in a more frequent rotation. It has an increased production style that makes the album much more listenable for long periods of time. I usually set it on repeat and hardly notice when it starts over. I find many of the songs repeating themselves in my head throughout the day. This fact may be a deterrent if you do not like her music, but for me, it's wonderful. I like it when a song can enter my head like that and continue to provide me with a melody throughout my daily routine. I think that, if you didn't like Shut Up, you should give this disc a try. You might just like it."
5,Another amazing cd by Kelly....,"Once again Kelly managed to make a magnificent album!Her first ""Shut Up/Changes"" was just so amazing, I loved every song on it and she totally blew me away. Im disappointed she didnt like her first cd, because I loved it, and I think it was totally underappreciated. Kelly may not have the best voice out there, but she does have talent. Her music is original, she wrote all her songs, which many artists out today need to do, maybe they could take a lesson or 2 from Kelly on how to make an album that is actually GOOD. Hopefully this album will succeed higher then her first, because Kelly deserves some praise for her amazing work."
4,Sound's alot like Berlin too!!,overall good album some good songs. It's obvious that one word title track was ripped off from visage. Another song that sounds alot like a classic from the 80's is secrect lover sort of sounds like berlin's metro. Not to original but still a good cd for your collection.
1,you've got to be kidding!,"What a piece of junk. Some label actually wanted to put out a disc by her? She has completely no talent and only has a disc out because of Ozzie. Of course some songs sound good - in the studio they can do ANYTHING with her voice. With all the good music out there, why waste your money on this?"
3,wont play in my computer,"the CD won't play in my computer, all I could get to was the data track, and that had a nice vedio of one of the songs, I play my Cds on my computer, so this was a problem for me, I finaly found a program called audio crusher that managed to extract the songs to my hard drive so I could listen to them, I don't know if they had atempted copy protection or not, but it will not play on a standard windows XP or 98 computer.I love the songs, just not the way they are put on the disk."
2,Slepping in the Nothing CD,"The music is dated and reeks of early 90's. Linda Perry, an obvious untalented has-been, wrote all the songs in this horrible CD. There is no inspiration, the songs are simply terrible, the drums are boring; Perry is a disaster. Kelly should have known the songs were garbage, I find it hard to believe anyone would like them. A couple of high points are that she actually sings pretty well and is aware of her voice limitations. She keeps within her voice range. The first two songs could have been awesome had the teeny bopper bells been deleted and the overkill flanger effect minimized. The second song has a 70's disco drumbeat that just doesn't work - it weakened the song. Song three and four are latrine filler. The rest of the songs are low average. Ok to buy the CD if you like early 90's music and Kelly's voice."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I was amazed by this CD it's Gwen Stefani meets FeFe Dobson, it's awesome. ONE WORD and DON'T TOUCH WHILE I'M SLEEPING are by far the best, the others are good as well, like UH OH>I CAN'T WAIT and ENTROPY."
2,K. Osbourne vs. Visage,"Listen to One Word (the first track on the CD) and then to the 80s hit ""Fade to Gray"" by Visage. Sounds familiar or what???"
4,"Good workout music, anyway","I'd give this 3 and 1/2 stars, but the system doesn't allow it. I don't have her other CD (and I'm not going to), and like J.Brady, I got suckered in by the great single ""One Word,"" which really is GREAT, Visage-ripped or no. (Well, I know it is.) But I really don't mind listening to the rest of the album. They're cute little pop songs that are good for when you're out jogging or on the dancefloor. Plus I just have a weakness for that '80s sound, which is competently replicated here. But if you're just sitting there listening to it with no other distractions, they really do start to sound quite similar. Still, I think it's a promising album for any future work she does, if she's in this game for the long haul. I get the feeling that in 5 years we'll all have forgotten who she is . . ."
5,One Of The Best CDs Ever-This Is Exactly What They Were Like,"Anyone who saw these guys in their prime in the early '80s (when this set was recorded) knows what they could do - and this CD shows it. One of the best live boogie/blues/rock bands ever, puts out a collection without one weak song. Mark Wenner is unsurpassed on harmonicas and Jimmy Thackery's guitar is high energy all the way. While almost all their other CDs are a mix of some great and some OK tracks, this one is great all the way through. Crank this up and picture yourself in a small smoke filled club like the old ""Double Door"" in Charlotte, with these guys so close that Thackery would actually walk out into the audience for some songs as they shook the walls. If you don't find yourself stompin' your foot to this CD, you're older than I am (maybe dead)."
5,"The Blues With Tatoo's, the Bad Boys from Bethesda, the Nighthawks!!!!","Just thinking about this album gives me a thrill, the thrill that I getwhen I seen these guy's live. I have said it before, the live venue isthe best way to listen to the Nighthawks. Plus they never disappointwith their song list, yes on the live albums you may get songs fromprevious live albums, but what the heck, their song range is vast, andthey prove how vast it is through out their full catalogue of discs.Strong, wrapped almost too tight blues, fuled by 100 octane, caution keepaway from open flame or sparks."
2,Dimensions incorrect,"This brush was misrepresented and is not 10.5 inches long, but 7 inches rather. The only reason I purchased this was because it said 10.5 inches and it will not work for my purpose. Additionally, the bristles are not as tough as I thought they would be."
4,works better than I thought,I thought it was too big but it worked better than I thought it would-not too soft or hard. I use it for cleaning up spills on my rugs--
2,"Good itea, but....","I like the idea that the blinds hang on a standard curtain pole, so you don't have to fuss around with mounting. However, the selection is slim, and I don't think you can even find these anymore. I did order the natural/ivory color, but they are not lined and don't keep out the light at night, when I want the bedroom to be DARK. I also have a pair in dark purple, which blocks the light better. I agree that you have to be very careful raising and lowering them, the mechanism is rather flimsy."
5,Majestic Marianne,"Someone else already said this, but this album is worth every penny just for ""I'm On Fire."" This has to be one of the best songs she has ever recorded. It's a majestic hymn with her talk/singing about happiness and love coming to her in disguise, but being able to find the happiness and leave behind the pain. It just sickens me this will never make it to radio and become a hit for everyone to hear. It puts everything else on the charts to shame. And Billy Corgan from Smashing Pumpkins helped her write it. This may be his best work ever as well. I could go and on about this one song, but the album is full of wonderful tracks--""Sex With Strangers"" and ""Wherever I Go"" just two of them. I have loved Marianne for years and years and she just keeps getting better and better. Cheers, Marianne."
4,Kissin' Time,"Kissin' Time being Faitfull's 2002 release and is a collaborative effort with the likes of Beck, Billy Corgan, Dave Stewart and Blur. The sound is a mix between new wave, rock and experimental rock. All the lyrics are included in the booklet and some very modern art. For each track we also get info on whom plays what on the track. Allmusic gave the album 4/5 whilst Rolling Stone gave it 3/5. I am in more in line with Allmusic and give this album 4/5."
5,They put The Funk Back in It!,"Damn they came back strong on this one!I got stuck on ""We've Got"" for six times,""Sex God"", & ""All Fired Up"" had me going! The other cuts are also great tunes If you dig live musicians & great singing pick it up. Carlos ""NYC Bass Playa"""
1,"I really wanted to like this, but it's dragged down by a weary vibe","I'm a fan of BNH's style and CDs of the mid-'90s and was excited to find out that they put out a new disc with the old lineup. I was really disappointed in the slower tempos, lack of vocal bounce and general feeling of tiredness coming through. I can see how people who like a more sedate and ""mature"" approach might like this, but I miss the energy and positive vibe of the old BNH.It's great when musicians ""grow,"" but it works best when they are able to discern the framework that got people to like them and develop that framework. This disc abandons the brightness that made BNH so refreshing in the past and replaces it with a kind of weariness that is unbecoming for this band."
2,Feels underwhelming upon several listens,"A lot of the songs on the BNH's new release did not grab me. The best song on here is ""All fired up"" IMO. This cut is funky. I welcome and applaud the musicianship on here, but compared to ""Shelter"" this cd falls short of my expectations. I'm all for sticking with a formula, but they need to mix their signature sound with a more updated sound IMO. This cd lacks experimentation and artistic growth. Welcome back BNH, but please take risks on your next cd."
2,just ok,"i use to really be digging this band back in the early to late 90's,but they just got stuck on a groove&now seem desperate to re-connect when if they had have kept things on point they would be ahead of the musical curve. bringing back N'Dea is a little too late now. a New producer&some new Songwriting ideas might do them some good. there first 3 albums were cool,but it's been a good minute since I felt anything by them. there are Grooves, Hooks&Runs in there music,but this ain't like it use to be. glad they are still around doing there thing,but I feel they need to up-date there sound&add some new writing."
3,Getting used to Get Used To It.,"Unlike a few other reviews on this page, I found this CD a little lame to begin with and I loved, loved, loved WE WON'T STOP - JAPAN CD. I thought it was funny, fresh and sexy. However, my disappointment was N'Dea dampening down the covers on this album instead of stomping them up. But like all good CDs after a few listens I'm getting used to 'GET USED TO IT'. I just wish they would play alittle more in their home country. I love you BNH always have and always will whatever you play. It is always played your way! xx"
1,It's not what I've got used to,"""Get Used to It"" and ""We won't stop"" are TBNH releases that share the same category: boring music.Where's the energy? Where's the passion and love? Where's the catchy music?How I miss TBNH from Shelter and Brother & Sister!!"
5,Sensational,"""Get Used To It"" by The Heavies is another installment of true funk. We've Got, I Don't Know Why, We Won't Stop and SexGod are by far some of the most seductively funky tracks that I have heard in the last few years. N'Dea has again provided us with a old school/ modern sound. Her vocals are truly masterful. At times she sounds brash and others withering but you can sense she is baiting you. Then she leads you down to a tremendous explosion of vocal mastery. Welcome back N'Dea. The sound the Heavies are offering is nothing short of what you should expect from a group with this talent. They have found a way to place you back into the music just the way that the mature artist of the 60's and 70's did. This is a must purchase with caution. You will listen to this way too much and it will lead to other purchases of BNH CD's. All of which are good things. Enjoy!"
4,good brush but but bristles are soft,"This is a really good brush but I was surprised at how soft the bristles ended up being. So far it works great but I'm wondering how it will hold up to tough grim. Brush arrived on time and packaged well. If you don't mind softer bristles, I would recommend this item and seller."
5,OXO flexible bottle brush,"How much can you say about a bottle brush? It's flexible, has a fairly long handle, and a nice brush head that allows you to move it around some curves and right spaces, but it will not necessarily fit all the nooks and crannies in certain containers because unless you can manipulate the long handle, you won't be able to bend it enough to fit into the tight spaces. Otherwise, a great product."
4,Kind of flimsy but good,"Kind of flimsy but not bad for the price. The shape is unique and useful. I only bought it as an add on item - not sure I would have bought it otherwise, but it's nice to have"
2,Not good for scrubbing,"Too soft, reach bottom of container but brush is so soft at tip make cleaning very difficult. Would not buy"
3,Bottle washer,I bought it for the water bottles and the water bottles that have a narrow opening can be a little tricky for this brush.
5,Useful!,"Very useful, still have it after all this time. Cleans our thermos well and gets into those hard to reach bottlenecks. Good purchase."
5,Great,Its a bottle brush - you dont really need any more than this one. Fits almost all bottles ive put it in and allows you to clean the bottom and sides (some dont have bristles on the bottom)
3,Bottle Brush,"Does anyone actually love a bottle-brush? This is what it promises to be - a functional bottle brush. The bristles could be a tad stiffer for my taste, but it does the job."
1,Does not fit in a bottle,I wanted this to clean bottles. It does not fit in most standard bottles. Why do you call it a bottle brush? You should call it a cup and glass brush.
1,"Bottle brush for crystal, not for the coffee pot","I can see how this would be the perfect brush for delicate items. Crystal, anyone? But...I don't have delicate items. I have lots of things like the coffee pot that frequently get built up residue that will only come out with a stiff bottle brush. This is not that kind of bottle brush. The bristles are very, very soft. You might be able to irritate the skin on your hand with it if you rubbed the brush on it about a thousand times. Don't try it - this is just a way for me to let you know how soft the brush seems to me."
5,good for home and travel,"Using this brush on a regular basis at home allows me to quickly wash things off without putting my hands in the soapy water. On a recent trip I decided to take it along with a little dish soap to wash out water bottles and baby's sippy cups. it worked great in the hotel rooms and at our destination. after use, i put it in zip lock bag until we reached the next destination.I bought one for my daughter (the mom of baby). I also bought one for my son, who commutes to work and stays in a remote location, so he could wash out water bottles and other dishes easily. Very handy. i store upside down in a small utensil crock when at home so it dries out between uses."
5,It does what is's suppose to.,I needed this brush for my water bottles and reusable soda bottles. I also use it for my daughter's cups. It's a good product.
4,good brush,"The brush is good quality & does fine for glasses & baby bottles. I, unfortunately, bought it to use to clean swing top bottles that I use for kifir soda. It will not fit through the opening. I decided on this one after another reviewer said that they used it to clean beer bottles. Their bottles must have larger openings than mine."
2,Bristles are too weak.,"I was hoping to clean the inside of my stainless steel thermos coffee pot with this brush. The good thing is that it fit through the small opening and the handle is long enough to reach the bottom of the 12 cup thermos, but the brush's bristles are so weak that virtually none of the brown coating from the coffee came off the sides and bottom of the thermos. I tried both dishsoap and a scratch free cleaning powder along with hot water, but this brush was useless. I'll have to keep searching for one with more sturdy bristles."
1,NOTHING like the old Oxo Brush that I have,"Bought one of thse brushes years ago that has a black handle and still have the brush this day, using it EVERY DAY to clean my coffee pot, parts and cup at work. Bought this new Oxo brush with the white handle to use at home and left it in the hot dish water and found that the bristles are so soft that they warped on one side just sitting in the dish water. In any case, this brush is absolute junk compared to the old Oxo and the company ought to be ashamed."
2,Mediocre bottle brush,"The bristles on this brush are softer than you would think. The white bristles are pretty soft, and the blue ones are a little more stiff. It just feels like when using this to brush out my hydration bottle, that the bristles are so soft, they don't do much because they just bend to the core of the brush instead of sticking out and actually brushing the bottle. After one use of this brush, my blue bristles are already bent out of shape and stuck to the core of the brush...would not recommend to anyone else...."
1,"Bristles are much, much too soft","Great design, very poor execution. The bristles are so soft that the brush deforms if you leave it in the sink. Doesn't clean my stainless coffee carafe thoroughly."
5,Excellent for cleaning all kinds of bottles and carafes,"I use this brush to clean narrow-necked, glass bottles; stainless-steel, sports water bottles; glass carafes; and 16-ounce, tall, water glasses that are too narrow for my hand to fit inside.This has a really nice rubber grip. The bristles are firm enough to clean well, but not so hard they aren't flexible.Highly recommended!"
5,Great Brush,I originally bought this brush to clean out baby bottles. It has since proven to have many uses. The long handle gets into pretty much any container including those hard to clean drink containers. It is sturdy and the brush is abrasive enough to get things clean. I found that some of the brushes have metal handles that will rust and break after several months of use. I have had this one for quite a while and it is still in perfect shape. Would highly recommend.
5,Best Bottle Brush we have purchased,"BOTTLE TYPES WE OWNWe have numerous water bottles and stainless containers (Foogoo, Camelbak, Thermos to name a few). Some are BPA free plastic, some stainless inside and out.BOTTLE NECK SIZEThe neck opening of each of our bottles varies from 1.5 inches up to 3 inches (this is a Foogoo lunch container).BRUSH BRISTLES AND PERFORMANCEThis brush is the best one we have tried (we have tried three other brands). The bristles are firm enough to clean the bottles, but soft enough not to scratch them (unlike others we have tried). The handle just below the brush is flexible so it bends making it very easy to get every nook and cranny in all our containers.We use it on a daily basis. I donated our other ones after receiving this."
2,too big,it's well made and comfortable but the bristles are too large to get in narrow 'bottle' openingsbetter as a dish scrubber
4,Good value as an add-on. Not as nice as the stainless version,I picked this up as an add-on item to substitute for the stainless version. It seems like pretty good quality for what it is. I have yet to test the dishwasher safeness of either but plan on it. I do wish that these had the replaceable brush head like some of their other products.
2,to short,i am looking for a brush to clean thermos and they say they are long but they are not long enough so no it does not do the job
4,"Does the job, just wish the bristles were a little firmer for tougher jobs","This brush fits into bottles very easily, and does a really good job for things that are not dried on, it's not quite as effective for gunkier/dried on things, but filling the bottle with water and letting it soak first helps."
3,Bottle brush,"It's a bottle brush. I mean, it is a great bottle brush, as bottle brushes go. If I had to do it over again, I would just buy one at a local store."
3,Just the same as a toilet bowl brush and just as stiff,"Okay, MAYBE a bit more sanitary than a toilet bowl brush but it is one stiff bristled brush. Crazy stiff. If you want gentle, don't buy this."
5,Works great - For narrow and wide mouth bottles,This works great for both narrow and wide mouth bottles. I was not sure if it worked for narrow bottles after reading reviews here that it may not work for narrow mouth bottles. Glad it worked for my narrow mouth bottles.
1,Only Automatic Dish Soap Works,The only way to clean a Thermos is Automatic dish soap and boiling hot water. Shake every five minutes for 20 minutes and it will be as clean as a whistle only way to clean a thermos. Does not clean the side of the Thermos because it is too stiff and it will not even clean the bottom. I scrubbed for half an hour and looked into the thermos and the bottom only had a small area that was clean...So this looks like it will work but it won't...
3,Must have a wide mouth..or it doesn't fit.,"Bought the ""bottle"" brush to clean out beer bottles and wine bottles. Alas! The end is about 1/2 an inch too wideto fit into any wine or beer bottle..since these tend to be about the same size. In OTHER words...useless for what myintentions were. Now if you are going to use this brush on another wider mouthed bottle...go for it! It seems well made.Since it seems to be a little bit misleading in the way it was portrayed. 3 stars>"
2,Doesn't fit into the Guinea Pigs water bottle,"Have a look at the photograph and you will see that the head of brush is about half to three quarters an inch across, with the bristles I would guess you would struggle to fit it into any bottle with a mouth less than 1 inch.It is also very short (shorter than most bottles and flasks).In short it is too wide and too short to use in most glass bottles, thermos flasks, or the Guinea Pig's bottle (which is what I bought it for). It would work for wide mouth baby bottles, wine glasses, and plastic sport bottles, but I have no problem cleaning these without buying a special brush. I don't know what I will do with mine - probably keep in the drawer and throw it out next time we move..."
1,disappointed,"I was really disappointed in this brush. The way I viewed it was to clean the inside of the top of the Contigo lid. I did not want a bottle brush. I did not send it back , as I will use it for a bottle brush. Those lids need cleaning very good when you use it every day as I do. Look for something to clean them with and I will be happy. I love the cup! Sharon Briceno"
5,Good Brush for your Coffee Tumbler,"Works great for cleaning coffee tumblers and works pretty effectively on a CPAP reservior. I've also used it on my 1L Nalgene bottle and it cleaned it very well. Its next test will be my 3L CamelBak reservoir. I found if I quickly roll the handle quickly between my hands with the brush head in the empty sink basin (to catch the spray), it dries very fast."
5,Very Useful,"OXO Good Grips Bottle BrushI use these brushes to clean out my thermos bottles. They get the bottom well scrubbed becausethe bristles aren't just on the sides but also cover the bottom of the brush, so you can clean all surfaces of glasses, cups, and especially thermoses.I also use one of these brushes to clean out the little squares inside my clothes dryer drum where the lint filter is. The bristles grab and hold onto the lint.We've used a lot of OXO products in our home because of the quality and ease of handling.I've liked almost all of these different kinds of OXO products."
5,Too big for fingertip sized bottle openings.,"My hummingbird bottles need regular cleaning. They are glass with a narrow opening at the top. It is about finger tip size and I was hoping that this brush would fit but it didn't. So I can't really report on how well it works, but it does appear to be well made."
3,"Nice Idea, too short for the work","I have a 1.8 liter, (61 oz) Thermos bottle and when I bought it from Amazon, this Bottle Brush was suggested to go with it. I bought the brush thinking it would be perfect for cleaning my thermos, but alas, it is too short to make it to the bottom of my thermos. (The thermos will hold an entire 12 cups from a standard coffee brewer, so it's an unusually big thermos).But the brush does come in handy while washing other dishes, and its great for cleaning mesh strainers."
2,too big for standard bottle neck,"Whoa,unbelievable,the diameter of the plastic shaft is BIGGER then a standard wine, water, etc etc bottle.I cannot believe that is not even a consideration worth mentioning in the manufacturer or amazon description"
5,Soft and Flexible,I finally got my old Nalgene bottle cleaned out that has been hiding at the back of my cupboard with this great brush. I thought the bottle WAS clean until I saw that the slightly cloudy film that was on the very bottom was not there anymore. I couldn't be happier knowing that I won't be drinking anymore germs or excess cleaning products that failed to rinse. When this one wears out I will purchase another.
3,Durable Works Well WIth Only Wide Neck Types!,CAUTION! DOES NOT CLEAN A 32 Oz. Real Lemon Type of Narrow Bottleneck and Similar Bottles! Peanut Butter Jar and similar type does work well. Basically any size BOTTLENECK OVER 1 inch in diameter. I still have to rely on my old partially rusted wired brush bendable bottle cleaner.
4,Cleaning!,Product is just write for any cups. Oxo is one of my kitchen favorites. This brush is also easy to clean after use too.
4,Love this brush!,"I run an in-home daycare that uses a lot of sippy cups and also use a lot of reusable water bottles. This brush has held up remarkably well! It hasn't ""scratched"" the insides of the bottles or cups. You can also throw it in the dishwasher to clean it. I haven't used the sanitize cycle or heat dry because I do worry about the bristles melting but it comes out clean and stink free. I didn't give it 4 stars because the handle is thick enough that if you try and hang it up on a hook is lays a little funny against the wall."
5,Love this brush,"I purchase this brush with a mug for my husband, but now I this brush more than the mug. I even use it to wash my 2-years-old's Avene bottle. The neck is flexible and long enough so you can reach all the angles and make it all clean. Ultimate brush!"
5,"simple, effective.","durable, flexible, excellent for cleaning up juicers and the glass Aquasana bottles. The rubber handle is comfortable and has a great grip."
2,to soft,"the brush is very, very, soft maybe too soft to effectively clean what i needed it to. In a case such as this its best to touch test before purchasing"
2,Doesn't do a great job cleaning,"I usually love OXO products so I had high hopes when I bought this. But it does an inferior job to either of the other two bottle brushes I have, the sponge one and the hard bristle one. I would never buy it again."
3,Does not fit in beer bottles,"I bought this to wash bottles for home brewing. Mostly I didn't even look at it properly before i ordered. Its still a great little brush to have around for dishes and water bottles and such, but heads up, it doesn't fit in beer bottles."
5,Great tool,"I have had problems finding bottle washers that are long enough and durable enough for cleaning thermos bottles, but this brush is ideal."
3,good for its intended purpose only,"I washed my Klean Kanteen with ease, but the bristles are way too soft to clean a tea stained mug."
5,Oxo Bottle Brush- great for Nalgenes!,"I searched high and low for a bottle brush that would fit in my Nalgene Narrow Mouth water bottle, and that wouldn't scratch it up. I purchased this on Amazon and it works great! It easily fits into the Narrow Mouth opening and the flexible neck allows you to clean all areas of the bottle. I don't like to put my Nalgene in the dishwasher, and this makes it so I don't need to. The soft bristles don't scratch the bottle, so my Nalgene continues to look brand new. This is the best bottle brush around!"
5,long,Its a nice size for water bottles. Its long enough so I am able to clean the hard to reach bottom of bottle.
2,"Well, you get what you pay for...","It's not that I don't like it *completely* because it's sorta-kinda usable, but I don't know for how long. It's pretty flimsy, and I'm afraid to put a lot of pressure on it. I bought it to use with my Hydro Flask stainless steel drinking bottle, and it is too flimsy to do the job correctly. It was a $5 add-on, and I couldn't be bothered to return it. YMMV."
4,Nice brush,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it. So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled. This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations. Not good as a toothbrush, but good back scratch! I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good, and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
3,A little more flimsy than I would have liked,"I bought this brush to clean our travel mugs and stainless steel water bottles. It reaches where it needs to reach but there doesn't appear to be enough bristles and the white stick part of the brush is too flimsy for my liking. I would have preferred a hard plastic stick. As it is, the brush bends when you apply the slightest pressure so you can't really scrub well with it. I understand that this is a bottle brush but sometimes you get gunk on the bottom that you want to clean out which would be difficult with this brush because of the way it gives. It works well with my travel mugs that just have coffee in them and are cleaned daily. I might find something else for the water bottles that have a biggest bottom surface area that is harder to reach and clean with this brush. For baby bottles, this would work well."
2,Too soft,I was expecting something a little firmer to really scrub out the gunge in my water bottle. This only works if I use it while things are still 'fresh'.
3,Brush needs firmer bristles,Its OK Would not buy again it's to soft need firmer brush.But it does the job.I love OXO products never had a complaint with any other product.
5,Works well,"There's not a lot you can say about a bottle brush, it either works or you wasted money. This one works well and is large enough in diameter to clean the inside bottom where the milk likes to hide. 'nuff said!"
5,Makes cleaning easy,"I use this to wash out my thermos or tumblers. When I drink coffee I usually add a little chocolate powder, so if I don't end up finishing my cup it stays at the bottom or it can get on the sides and that can be a pain. This brush helps a lot. It reaches where a normal sponge can't and it cleans it well."
3,Fits into bottles but bristles are too soft.,"I know, I know. Too soft? How else would they fit into the small neck of a baby bottle, right?Well, I have some scum in the bottom of these baby bottles and this is not working to scrub it out. No matter how hard I push. So while this fits into bottles, and will ""clean"" bottles that don't have dried milk scum on them, it won't scrub them. It's about as soft as a soft toothbrush. We have a dishwasher, too, so this is stuff that won't really come clean without some powerful bristles.P.S. The milk scum is from almond milk, which we gave my daughter when she was sick with a chest cold instead of regular milk, which makes the mucus thicker."
3,1 Pro and 2 Cons,PRO = The handle feels comfortable and sturdy. Very ergonomic.CONS #1 = The bristles are like a soft bristle tooth brush. Ok for light cleaning but not for scrubbing.CONS #2 = The top is too wide for cleaning baby bottle nipples. Our old clean brush tapered at the tip so it can fit narrower areas. Not a problem for cleaning coffee mugs and cups but not too great for baby bottles and other narrow at the top containers.
3,Good and bad,"The product is pretty solid for most of the bottles. But it does not fit 1"" mouth bottles. I think the minimum is 1.5"". it should have been stated in the product specifications."
3,"Good brush, but not great with Aquasana bottles","As the title says, this is overall a very good brush. But Amazon (based on the buy these items together link) misled me to believe that these would actually work well with the Aquasana 27oz glass bottles. They do indeed fit in the mouth of the bottle which is a feat, however, they leave the bottom 2-3 inches of the bottle untouched due to the width of the rubber on the handle."
5,Good brush,This is a good brush for the money. Not much more that you can say about a basic item - I'm happy with it.
5,Excellent,I stockpile these. I prefer these to sponges and these make it easy to clean the delicate glasses and the hand-trapping traveling coffee mugs/water bottles.
2,Not the least bit entertaining,"David Harum is an old guy who loves to tell long, drawnout stories about nothing in particular. The author writes Harum's stories in dialect, a pet peeve of mine. It would be endurable if the stories had anything to do with anything, but most of the time they don't. There's even a long, drawn-out story of Harum telling a long, drawn-out story! I'm doubly damned. There's a secondary character of John Lennox. We get a brief glimpse of his story and the cold fish he ends up with, but his main purpose in the book is to be the audience for Harum's tall tales. I don't recommend this book at all."
5,very nice and eazy,this kit is very nice bright and very eazy to put on and didnt have a problem with them at all from when i put them tell now and still dont
4,Comfortable,"Valerie Wolzien has again written a new version of the simple cozy. She weaves a blanket of established characters who are good friends, new suspects who are unique and interesting, and a plot that twists and turns. Her style draws me into each story looking for the new information the setting will offer and leaves me feeling warm and satisfied with an outcome that surprises but does not disappoint me."
4,Another good cozy by Valerie Wolzien,"Ms. Wolzien once again takes us back to Hancock, CT. A former resident is visiting obscure civic groups and promising them huge donations it they recognize him with a plaque or statue. He calls all the civic leaders together at the Hancock Inn to announce the winner of his largesse, but is found dead in the wine cellar. Guess who solves the mystery?This is another wonderful cozy by Ms. Wolzien. The characters are both new and old and the mystery is well crafted. I certainly wouldn't want to live in Hancock."
4,Annoyed by Short Life Span.,"A little over three years ago, I bought a new low-volume toilet for our redecorated bathroom. It worked fine until a couple weeks ago when the fill valve ceased to function. I've had this happen numerous times in my life with other toilets so it was no big deal. I took the valve out, took it to the local hardware store and bought a new identical model, a Fluidmaster Toilet Fill Valve. It was fairly easy to install, although I had a few minor gripes about leaking until I finally fixed it. Now it works fine, just like the old one did, I like the fact that it is adjustable. Well, my only gripe is the short life span. Do toilet valves really have to be replaced every three years. Surely not. This one must have been defective. My only reason for buying a new one of the same make and model was my hope for simplicity of repair. I'm annoyed at the short life span and hope this new one will do better.Gary Peterson"
2,Mixed Results,"I am happy to see several content albeit not handyman customers. After installing a number of these 400A's, I would say you have a 50-50 chance getting a functional one. I just installed another one and the float doesn't float! Therefore the valve kept shooting more water every 30 seconds until it overflowed the tube. What should I expect, cheap product, cheap results.If you review the Korky Quietfill Valve here on Amazon, you'll find numerous Fluidmaster 400A being tossed for them. Much better construction and overall dependable function. Also, if you don't have a water descaler like found at www.stopwaterscale.com, then you will get scum build-up on the 400A in a couple years sufficient to require another replacement of the Fluidmaster. The sliding float gets caught if the center tube is slimmed with scale, which causes it to fail. The Korky Quietfill Valve has no such problems and should last as long as your water softener membrane, which is subject to city water chemicals."
4,Just Fine,"Works just fine. Take ""Universal fit"" items with some common sense, Do all research possible for your items and you'll be fine. Go out on a limb and get it for a brand or model not so commonplace and you'll be taking your chances unless it is specifically listed as a replacement for that brand/model. I had to download the instructions for my American Standard model from the internet as I had misfiled them. They called for this item by part number. Fixed the problem. Easy install not any problems. Only gave it 4 stars because I think float assemblies should last longer than they do in the first place. I'll be lucky to get 3-4 years out of this one just like the factory installed one or another replacement. Installed in an American Standard Champion 4 which is too new of a model to have any issues at all in my opinion."
4,GOOD PRODUCT,"It is a good product. easy to install and it work well so far.In ref. to Robert R. Rainey Jr. problems; I experienced the same at the beginning and I resolved the problems by replacing the old toilet flapper. The old one was hardened and it didn't seal the opening completely, a very very small leak, I can't even hear it. The leak takes hours to activate the refill action for a second"
1,You will be replacing this annually!,I made the big mistake of replacing a couple of toilets in my house with Briggs 4400's. They use the Fluidmaster 400 tank fill valve and I have problems with them every single year. I have city water that is a little hard and it causes the black float to bind on the gray tube after about 1 - 1.5 years. I have tried cleaning the parts but you can't clean inside the hole of the black float. So every year or so I have to replace the thing. Fun.
1,cheap and not long lasting,This worked... for less than two years. Then it started running. Apparently it chose to do this while I was on vacation. You can imagine my dismay at the astronomical water bill. Recommend you get something else.
5,My Girlfriend loved it.,"I bought this book for my girlfriend and she loved it, from the illustrations to the content. I even found it interesting to put my own ideas in order to write my stories."
1,Felt Scatterbrained.,I felt the booked lacked a lot. The art was great but i learned nothing from the book in regards to writing. I was expecting something a bit more descriptive and was disappointed. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
3,Where are they headed to?,"The best thing to do with this CD is to lie in your bed with those really big Mickey Mouse headphones, turning the volume waayyyyy up, and to feel your soul leave your body as you savor the tracks. Then fall asleep. You will--exhausted. Each song is textured so that you feel like you're on a fashion show run-way and in a jungle at the same time. Some songs that stand out are ""Anthem,"" found on the ""Pi"" soundtrack (also check out Clint Mansell); ""Northern Lights""; ""Purple""--the highlight of the EP and previously on ""Polydistortions""; and ""Sleepytime."" Though ""Gus Gus vs. T-World"" doesn't compare to ""Polydistortions"" stylistically, it certainly is highly listenable and better than most electronica music out nowadays. Buy it, and you'll get a free history lesson of the house/trance genre."
2,"Come on, it's not Gus Gus","While hyped as Gus Gus' new album, GUS GUS VS T-WORLD is actually just repackaged tracks from proto-Gus Gus effort T-World (circa 1995). It's a collection of boring house mixes. Little on here is actually fun to listen to, and they all lack the characteristic Gus Gus groove that (sadly ex-) members Daniel Agust and Hafdis Huld brought to the band because they had yet to join Biggi Veira and Herb Legowitz and make the Gus Gus most of us know.The album is doing well on the dance charts as I write this, and I agree that some of the songs here might make a good background for those looking for uninvolving techno, but those expecting a bona fide Gus Gus release are going to be disappointed."
3,not new at all,"I bought this album as a holiday present for my wife, because she has their others and it was dated 2000 with a big sticker saying ""7 All New Instrumental Tracks."" Great, except its a LIE!Every track on this album has been previously released, and im ticked off because I already own the other albums!Don't get me wrong, the tracks are great to listen to, just dont bother if you already own Polydistortion and This is Normal."
2,"Really, really, boring repetitive low-key techno","On it's own, this record may be (barely) decent, but compared to Gus Gus' other efforts it is surprisingly lame, boring, monotonous, unoriginal, etc. I know it's their earlier work, and perhaps they were ahead of their time--but instead of appreciating their ""roots"" it's much more enjoyable to listen to their more developed recordings. This CD has no standout tracks, save for ""purple"", which was already released on their other records. This CD does not seem like a ""Gus Gus"" CD--it could be anybody making mediocre techno music with a synthesizer and boring samples. Buyers beware, for die-hard fans only..."
2,Is this even the same band that wrote polydistortion?,"Polydistortion is, in my opinion, one of the greatest albums in the last decade. So what's the deal with this stuff? Frankly, its not horrible. Anthem is catchy, and the rest of the CD makes great background music for your party. But its unadulterated suburban dance club music, plain and simple. It's stunning that a band could deteriorate this bad this fast. You might like it, but promise me you'll at least listen to it first. Keep your mind open and your expectations low low low."
4,"Good Value, uses smaller bulb","This lamp is a good value. The only problem I had is that the lamp does not use standard size light bulbs. The bulb base is smaller than a ""standard"" bulb. It comes with an incandescent bulb and I wanted to use a fluorescent."
1,What a joke!,I know that dog toys don't last but I have a 28lb Beagle and he likes to chew I got him this for his first birthday and first the package on Amazon looks much bigger then it actually is to say it is a trinket is an understatement and it lasted about 1 hour before it was done. I dont recommend this but I highly recommend Kong products as they are very good but this was a disappointment.
3,"Good legal thriller, but...",Good legal thriller but poor research in non legal areas with unbelievable scenarios and dialog.
4,"What ever happened to ""Broken Edge""","Look I love the karate kid. It siginfied a glory time in my life. That year I saw the Outsiders, Eddie and the Cruisers and the Karate Kid...need I say more. It was awsome. However this soundtrack needs a bit of help. Number one no Cruel Summer by the infmaous Bananarama. Everyone (mostly chicks) always think of this tune and poor little Daniel son weaving in between busses when they think of the ""karate Kid"". Also why isnt Broken Edge's ""Please answer me"" on the soundtrack?? In the infamous dance scenes listen closely to the hook of this tune right before Ali (with an I) trips the Cobra Kai, and you'll get the money shot of all dance tunes. Yep folks it's up there with the Plimsouls role in Valley Girl. Nonetheless what ever happened to Broken Edge?? I'd love to know, apparently they were a Reseda band that got lucky and were in the movie and the soundtrack. So if ya know email me at chrisnope@yahoo. Im a musician/producer myself now and I want the chords/lyrics!"
5,I Want the SOUNDTRACK!!!,"I love the movie, a true american classic. The music in the movie is so motivating and inspirational."
3,Average at best,"I bought this CD in anticipation of hearing most of the good songs from the film the Karate Kid. This CD features a number of good songs, but is lacking many songs from thne film. Cruel Summer, The Ride, the song from the beginning of the film, the song when Daniel was in the dance floor in the shower, and several others are missing on this CD. On top of that some of the songs are not even the originals featured in the film.The song ""Feel the Night"" is one such example. The version of this song from the film is missing in this CD. It was good to hear some of the classics from the 1980's, but only how I wish this CD had all the songs from the film."
3,NEEDS PANFLUTES,"This is a pretty ok soundtrack with good 80's songs but like so many others out there, I was really hoping for some instrumental music, the panflute music that was played in the movie is heavenly. It is what really makes the movie work. If they ever release the instrumental music to the Karate Kid trilogy I will snap it up in a second."
4,Great Soundtrack with Killer Music,"This soundtrack is a must if you liked the movie. It has everything that I love in a soundtrack, but the only thing it doesn't have is Cruel Summer by Bannanarama."
1,Not a Soundtrack,"This album should be called ""Songs from The Karate Kid"".I expected to see some of the songs on this album but not 'only' the songs. Where is the beautiful instrumental music from Bill Conti? A major disappointment."
4,Bill Conti Karate Kid collection released,"I'm such a fan of the Karate Kid films -- at least the first two -- that I'll take anything I can get. This is a great set that reminds me of the film, but it's missing Bill Conti's music. However, Varese Sarabande has just released (March '07) a 4-CD set containing Bill Conti's score to ALL FOUR Karate Kid movies. It's a limited press run of 2000 copies, available only on their website. It's fantastic. Now all I want is a CD of the Karate Kid Part II soundtrack that I had on cassette, containing Dennis DeYoung, New Edition, Carly Simon, et al. -- that would make me deleriously happy."
4,"great music, but missing a bit.","The sountrack is almost as good as the movie, except for the fact that it is missing Cruel Summmer by Bannanarama and it doesn't have any of the cool instrumental music played during the movie. I loved the pan flute but was dissapointed to find out it wasn't on the soundtrack."
5,I like the Karate Kid soundtrack.,This was a good soundtrack. Hard to find and well worth the effort. The last song on the soundtrack was the most motivating song i have ever heard. I recommened people try this album out if u r a 80's fan.
4,Not bad,"The steel finish on these picks are not matte (like in the photos) but shiny more like chrome. Cosmetically, over time they get scratched up when used to get into the nooks and crannies of hardshell crab. Functionally, though, they work well."
4,Very useful,"We had crab tonight, and these seafood picks work really well. The crabs have all the chambers at the connection between leg and body and the picks easily scooped out the meat. These picks are heavy and well made, with a soft grip that comes in handy because our hands tend to get messy from the seafood, so we can get a grip on the picks.I was worried the picks would be dangerous because one end is very sharp and two pronged and I worried that while I scooped with one end I might poke myself with the other, but that didn't happen. The sharp two prong end is perfect for grabbing hard to reach bits of seafood."
4,works as it should,These are a good design because they do not slip. The finish is good. The only issue is they are not the most beautiful picks in the world and probably won't look good on a fancy table. You shouldn't have to give up looks for good design.
5,Nice when new!,"I bought these for my crab-loving hubby and for myself to help get mussles out of their shells. Works well in both respects and they look nice. I like the dual ends-- one spoonish end for scooping and the other sharper end is more like a little fork. Ours are still new, so they look great. If they do dull down a bit, I still think that's a five star rating (unless you are using them in your own restaurant, I guess!)"
1,Piece of Junk,"This stapler is not worth a penny. It constantly jams. Every time I reload, it takes about 10 jams and half of the new clip of staples until it starts working. And yes, I am using genuine Arrow T50 staples for reloads. I know this is the only stapler like it on the market, but you would be better off with a hammer and a box of staples. Save your $20"
2,"Never jams, but pretty weak","Works great for putting 1/4"" staples through thin material. But if you are trying to put 1/2"" staples through even a few layers of paper or fabric, bring your hammer, because you have to help the staples for the last 1/8 to 1/4"". And of course, the staples will just bend then.Tried to use this to tack roofing paper down and most recently for reupholstering some dining room chairs. Again, the 1/4"" staples worked fine, but once the fabric was double in places, the 1/4"" wasn't long enough, and the 1/2"" didn't go in all the way. And yeah, I was leanin' on it too.But it does never jam."
1,Actual Stapler NOT as shown in picture,I offered to purchase this for a family member for Christmas and after researching a lot os sites found what I thought was exactly what I wanted here. The PICTURE SHOWS the stapler in a case with the two attachments that I was looking for. The attachments are also listed in the description. My brother already HAS the stapler but I bought the whole package to get the case and the attachments. ALL YOU GET is the staper. Could have bought that at HOME DEPOT FOR THE SAME PRICE. Now I have no gift and look like an idiot because I trusted AMAZON. First time buyer and VERY DISAPPOINTED. PUT THE ACTUAL PICTURE SO WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE BUYING!
1,It jams... alot,"Ok, I've had nothing but trouble with this stapler, and it quite possibly could be a simple defect in my particular one, but I have to comment, regardless.I put up with this staple gun for some time before moving on to another (Stanley, actually and hasn't jammed yet), because this one just kept jamming... over and over. Despite using Arrow staples, in all sizes recommended for this model, I just couldn't get more than 3-4 staples in without it jamming again.Seems that others have had better luck, and that's good. Maybe my issue was just a fluke. Just be aware, there could be more out there with the same defect as mine."
1,Defective,"Just adding to the chorus. I purchased one, with Arrow staples, used as directed, and the gun simply does not work. On the first 20 tries, it spit out about 5 staples, then it stopped working altogether. I was checking out the action and I think the way the gun is built, it fails to push the staples to a position that is square prior to contact with the firing pin. Unfortunately, I can see no way to get into the gun to remedy that defect. I'm amazed that, with so many reviews like this, stores still carry this product on their shelves. Perhaps you'll get lucky and buy one without this defect, but how can you trust a company that sells broken tools?"
1,If you buy this staple gun buy a hammer also,"I bought this staple gun because staples are not being made for my 40+ year old Bostitch any longer, and this stapler seems to be one of the few choice around. I am really disappointed. It does not seat the staples like my old Bostitch, so I end up driving most of them home with a hammer. This stapler is poorly designed since the amount of pressure needed to shoot staple does not result in a seated staple. My old Bostitch was easy to push and still seated the staples."
1,Arrow T50P 1997,Never worked well. Needed 10 trys to get one staple in. I did used correct arrow staples.
3,Jambs often,"I have had a T-50 staple gun for many years. It frequently jambs. I have learned to take it apart with my pockey knife while hanging on a ladder to clear a jamb. If I climbed down every time it jambed, I wolud spend all my time going up and down the ladder!Other than the jambing, it has been an OK tool. It works just as well with Stanley staples which are cheaper at Wal Mart. Jambs with them too!I would suggest another brand but don't know of any that are better, I had another brand which had the same problem. Hope you have better luck!"
1,Absolutely worthless piece of sh*t,"If you enjoy constantly having to take a stapler things apart to remove jams, then the Arrow T-50 ""heavy duty"" stapler is for you. And I never ran any kind of staples through it other than Arrow.Picture this: As darkness was falling, I was trying frantically to staple down tar paper on a new roof in preparation for a predicted heavy downpour. So imagine how happy I was being forced to stop work every 5-10 minutes to take the whole front end of my Arrow stapler apart (snap rings and pins) so that I could pry out a jammed staple with needlenose pliers. When the roofing job was finished, I took a sledge hammer to that damned Arrow stapler. Never again will I buy an Arrow product."
4,"Slavery and the Evolution of Cherokee Society, 1540-1866",Outstanding book that addresses for the first time (for me) the relationship the Cherokees had with whites and blacks in the early years. This fills a real hole in our historical understanding of the peoples that make-up the majority of the United States.
3,"Nice bag, No tote","I ordered this bag for my nephew who adores race cars. We like the bag- it's quite cute, but we'were disappointed that the storage tote that is described as coming WITH the bag was not included with it. For anyonw who has tried to roll one of these up- and keep it rolled up- well, you know how attractive a selling point the tote can be. So I asked for some help and Amazon responded quickly, ans they even shipped us for free a replacement but it didn't have one either."
3,Blunt,"Westcott is a big name in scissors, and I've had good luck in the past with this brand, so I thought I'd be safe in ordering this inexpensive item. However, what I got was a nice looking but not very useful scissors that has trouble cutting almost anything I've thrown at it. Paper, plastic, other simple household items--should cut like butter. Maybe I got a lemon--not properly fitted--because it just doesn't bite into things the way you'd expect a 200-year-old technology to handle. Oh, well."
5,Very nice,"These scissors are sharp and easy to use. The grip is nothing fancy, but I found them easy to hang onto. I received them on time without issue."
2,I Can't Lie - it's Kitsch,"But you can't blame the guy. He's got to eat just like the rest of us. Back in 1968 he noticed that Christmas records just sell and sell and sell, so he recorded one (""The New Possibility"") and wouldn't you know, it became his best seller - not Blind Joe Death, not Railroad, not The Yellow Princess or any of those other masterpieces. So he put out more Christmas albums over the years (I think I count five) and this is the ickiest one of the lot - can you stand ""The Skater's Waltz"" or ""Do You Hear what I Hear""? The music is mostly duets with Terry Robb, and most mellifluous they are too. And I guess guitarists will like the arrangements. But as a Fahey record, this is for completists."
2,tedious,"NY romance writer agrees to go to attractive but staid sex scientist's Scotland castle to help him with research in return for $20K which she needs to bail her younger sister out again from trouble. Both are attracted to each other but certain challenges bar them from giving in to their attraction.I really liked George's other books (i.e., To Die For, Art of Seduction) but I did NOT like this book. It was a chore to read. Many things (dialogue, characters, scenarios) were too contrived. It didn't flow well, which made for a s-l-o-w read. The romance & sexual chemistry did not draw me either. This book didn't draw my emotions...except maybe feelings of irritation.Cautiously recommended."
3,Mixed feelings,"I usually prefer historical romances and read something else just for a change of pace. I don't think this is as good as George's historicals.There were some funny moments and some good chemistry (although sometimes the romance between the lead couple's best friends was spicier than the main romance). The third & fourth romances were unbelieveable and unnecessary. Please! Some of the scenes were silly rather than funny, and yes, far too many cliches were tossed in there. The author also had the bad habit of repeating herself. But there were good moments.My advice is to borrow the book from the library rather than buying it."
3,Yet another virginal heroine gets her groove on,"Mallory is a virginal novelist who writes steamy erotic novels. When her sister comes to her because her bookie wants his $21,000, Mallory takes a job as a romance consultant to help wealthy scientist Dexter learn the art of romance so he can be a better husband to his fianc?. She does not count on her geeky scientist actually being a hottie, nor his favored pet being a temperamental monkey. It does not take a rocket scientist to guess that Mallory will forsake her virginity and start rolling in the sheets with her ""student."" I guess you could call it homework. But the two eventually fall in love, despite his promise to another.Though humorous at times, the story does get tedious and is riddled with cliches. The more engaging couple is Mallory's best friend, Freddie who trades cynical and witty barbs (and eventually more) with Dexter's butler, Cummins."
5,If you want to laugh . . .,"Ok, I'll start off by saying that if you want to laugh, this is the book for you. For some people, there may be too much humor. But for me, I eat it up. If you liked the secondary character of Reggie in George's historical, Devil May Care, then you'll .love Freddie, the heroine's best friend. The zingers she comes out with had me on the floor! And if you think Dexter is a bit of a stuffed shirt in the beginning, hold on for the ride and see his transformation! Brava, Ms. George."
4,Romantic comedy full of humour and fun,"Courtesy of A Romance ReviewThe Mating Game is a romantic comedy full of humour and fun. Not only are the hero and heroine attractive characters but also the secondary characters, Freddie and Cummings, make the story more alive, interesting and full of laughter. These two always argue and fight verbally like cats and dogs - Freddie, in a too straightforward way and Cummings, with his dark humour. Frankly speaking, these two have more sparks throughout the stories than Mallory and Dexter."
4,Instrumental wonderment!,"Your Zodiac sign set to music! This is basically a duet from Rick Wakeman & Tony Fernandez (keyboards & drums) with each track a musical interpretation of the 12 signs of the Zodiac. As such, the tunes go thru a variety of moods and tempos. This was one of the very first CDs I bought when I got my first CD player back in 1991, and I STILL hold it up as one of Wakeman's better efforts. That's really saying something when the guy has done OVER 50 solo albums to date! (And I confess here: I've often used the opening track ""Sagittarius"" to accompany my morning exercise routines. I bet Rick never envisioned THAT when he penned it!)"
2,AGH,Well I just got it. It is completely dented and bent. If it is made out of steel then why are the people so careless in handling it??? Really I cant imagine what it would look like if it were plastic. Whatever. Return shipping and refunds are a hassle. Just be warned. When you buy things on amazon they may be damaged. This is my fourth damaged product. Oh and the actual movies are terrible. These movies and the Garlic jr. are the worst things that ever happened to DBZ.
3,Decent,"Video:Amazing, vibrant, 1080p! Looks like I'm watching it in a movie theater. There is a bit of film noise and the original reel dots which is a bit distracting. 4/5 stars.Audio:English dubs are great. Original Japanese audio very quiet. Extremely disappointed that they didn't leave the original Japanese score behind the English dubs. 2/5 stars.Price:Worth it to any DBZ fan. 3/5 stars."
3,"Movie great, case has minor scratches","The movies were great, but the case itself had scratches on all four corners and had a small indent on the bottom left front,an inch away from the corner. The thing is that I can't complain, unlike the other two guys review, I had it easy. Just be wary when buying because if your a die hard collector that want it in mint condition, you might be disappointed."
3,Chipped after much abuse.,"Only after much use and abuse did some of these bit begin to chip and cam out. But, of course, the price is right."
3,It is heavier than I expect.,The tip didn't last long enough to buy this brand again. I am using my old bit for Phillips tip.
4,Nice sound track- but dated orchestration,"I love Celtic music, and being a huge Knopfler fan I bought this without auditioning it first. Good CD with a few very exceptional tracks- beautiful melodies. Be aware that the stereotypical mid 80s synth and drum sounds run thru most of the tracks. It would have sounded much better if they'd used a real string section. I was expecting a more authentic ""roots"" sound.dg"
4,A soothing score,"This Knopfler score has only a bit to do with the action of the film itself, I think - it certainly lacks the drama of the film's action; and yet, it is one of Knopfler's most listenable scores. Although not on a par with his lovely and on-the nose ""Local Hero"" score, the score for ""Cal"" still rates as one of Knopfler's best."
2,"Boring, depressing Irish music","There are three very good tracks on this CD featuring Knopfler on guitar. The rest is basic Irish music featuring a traditional Irish type of flute. It is an aquired taste. I found it to be high pitched and annoying. The music works well as the soundtrack of the movie which is love story set in the background of the IRA. But, the story is bleak and depressing, and so is the music. Out of the context of the movie, the music isn't that pleasant to listen to, and would be a real downer for a Sunday brunch or a dinner party. Someone calls it challenging. It is a challenge to sit through it.If you like the Titanic soundtrack, you would probably appreciate this. As a bonus, you don't have to listen to Celine Dion sing."
5,Very good product,This is easy to hold and did a great job for us. We had really dirty grout lines. This brush and baking soda cleaned them right up.
3,Will wear out fast!,I used this brush on a 3 x 3 section of my floor and doubt that it would last for the remaining 5 x 16 floor.
5,It will help...,Brought it and was glad I did when I attacked the grout for the tile in my bathroom. Worked great...
3,Brush Bristles Wear Easily,"This is my second OXO grout brush and their must have been a change in the provider of the bristles because these are not the same as on my first brush. I use this brush to clean the grout lines in my showers, specifically along the corners and rail for the shower door. I use with a travertine cleaner, and while travertine requires a soft brush, this replacement brush seems to be much more delicate than the one I am used to.The handle is still well designed and I prefer the OXO design to other brushes on the market. It is lightweight and has an ideal arc to the handle which allows you to scrub out the grout lines without rubbing out your knuckles. Now it is a narrow brush and not ideal for scrubbing the entire wall, but as far as being able to get the grout area with minimal effort, this brush is a good choice.Maybe I just got a soft brush that was part of a bad batch and at this price point I cannot really complain. So I would recommend and buy this brush again."
2,no work,"this one totly not work, when i use it, nothing happen at my sink, i am so dispoint about this one."
1,Totally useless,Purchased this a few weeks ago to clean tile grout.Bristles bent out of shape after a short time.OXO usually makes good products but not this one.A loser.
3,works but ....,nothing I use really cleans better than scrapping the top of the grout. It is a good built brush
1,Misleading advertising,I purchased a Wagner 915 steamer. This advertisement led me to believe that it was a Wagner attachment and could be used with the steamer. It is nothing more than a brush that could have been purchased anywhere.
4,GOOD GROUT BRUSH,"This grout brush sure beats using a toothbrush!! It has firm bristles, a comfortable handle and it sure cuts down on the back breaking labor of cleaning grout. Wish is had a handle that you could screw an extension into so that you wouldn't have to get on your hands and knees to clean the grout on tile floors. I guess that's just my ""old age"" and ""bad back"" talking....but it would sure help! Maybe Oxo is listening...lol."
2,Brush,I have stuff I needed to scrub really hard to get clean. The bristles on this brush bend and fold over. They are long and just don't feel like I can get any muscle behind my scrubs.
3,What can you say about a grout brush?,I used the grout brush with the ZEP grout cleaner. I used the brush on the edges and hard to reach areas. It was fine.
3,Ok,Works ok if you have a spray that cleans the grout. Maybe can use on other surfaces in the house.
3,nothing special,"about this brush, I would say it's slightly overpriced. It's hard bristle brush with the handle. I just tried it, it's OK like any other brush."
4,Decent grout brush.,"The OXO Good Grips 3781 Grout Brush does a good job cleaning very dirty grout. I'm using it withHoover AH30285 Floor Mate 32-Ounce Tile and Grout SprayandHoover FloorMate SpinScrub Wet/Dry Vacuum Cleaner, H3044.My process is to spray a heavy coat of the grout cleaner, wait 4-6 minutes, scrub with the Good Grips Grout Brush, wipe up the excess cleaner and loosened dirt with a sponge, and then scrub with the FloorMate.I like the Grout Brush, but there are two improvements I would make. First, I would have a longer handle. With the short handle, it's definitely a hands-and-knees operation, and that wears thin when you have many square feet to clean. Second, I would make the bristles stiffer. I've used the brush to clean about 450 sguare feet of tile, and the bristles are already beginning to seem a bit mashed. That might be because I was cleaning very dirty grout, but it does make me think that the life of the brush may not be that long."
1,Too soft to effectively clean grout,Very disappointed in this product. The bristles are too soft to really clean grout and the shape of the head isn't optimal for that purpose either.
4,No more toothbrush,"After several attempts to really clean some light colored grout in a very soiled environment with a soft bristle toothbrush, I decided to buy a proper tool and quit skinning my knuckles. OXO almost always makes good products, and this is no exception. The bristles are tough enough, and set at the right angle to really get into the grout cleaning process. The handle is comfortable. I have not owned the product long enough to give it a 5-star rating, but if it holds up until all my grout is cleaned at least once I will consider it a 5-star item. The price is right and the tool is appropriate for the job."
2,I tried to like it..,This CD is billed as cruising music; however it would be better described as a blues CD. Sarah performs the entire album with a six string and a very bluesy voice. Overall the songs are about boats and people but very little content to get you motivated. I would recommend you listen to it before you spend money on it..
4,A small package full of information,"A great little book, varierty of moves, well explained and nice photos of each move. Nothing new or exciting but good direction on the regular moves which is great you can never be too safe when it comes to proper form on the ball( we all know what it feels like to fall off!)"
2,The Great Body Ball Handbook,"This book cost too much for what it is. It is a light weight paperback for almost $10. I bought the Get on the Ball book and was recommended this book. While it does have some good moves and stretches, it was NOT worth the money."
3,The Great Body Ball Handbook,Another book that was a bit of a disappointment..more of a 'booklet'has good info just would like more!
1,One-Star Travelouge!,"I was disapointed with this travelogue! Specifically: 1) The sound level varied significantly - especially in the beginning; 2) The music track was mainly a loop of some flute music that started to get on my nerves; 3) too many locations were attempted in a short 38 minute program which resulted in seeing little of any one location; 4) Too many closeups without allowing enough establishing/wide shots to give the viewer an idea of what the general areas/cities looked like; 5) Live shots were somewhat shakey and at least one shot, the view of Neuschwanstein Castle, which was depicted on the cover of the DVD and one of the places I looked forward to seeing, was only a single photo of what appeared to be a postcard.I was hoping for some local culture in the way of people, dress, food, drink, customs, festivals, and tourist attractions, including some of the beautiful churches that were shown, but not that many. All in all - disappointing, for the most part."
2,not so cuddly,"Not exactly a plush doll,more like styro-foam. And of course it's made in china. What's in that stuff? The material it is made of is so dense it makes it hard. Not so snuggly for my 3 year old who specifically requested a Bart doll to sleep with."
4,"Eye-opening, engaging, and fun","When I first heard about this book, I thought`-- Don't women already know this stuff? I read it at the suggestion of a friend and discovered that there was plenty I did't know. That, for example, doctors and anatomists don`t agree on the shape and size of the clitoris. I'd suggest that every woman read it, even if they start out a bit skeptical, like me."
1,A complete waste of time,"This is a terrible book. What little it does tell you, it repeats over and over and over and over... The tiny amount of information to be gleaned from this amateur attempt at insight into female sexuality could have been paraphrased in three sentences. 1) Don't be afraid of asking for what you want. 2) Sex is better when the woman has orgasmed first and 3) You deserve it! Get a life women and figure it out on your own."
5,7 blade,excellant product saves hours of work and is very rugged these cords are a contractors dream a must if you have employees
5,"Good quality, molded plug","The plug is molded, which is great. It is very substantial and well made.Each wire is rated correctly (neutral and 12v for example being a heavier gauge than the turn signal).I would buy again"
1,Awesome quality control...,"I bought this as part of completely rewiring a trailer. Hooked everything up per standard wiring colors, and the breakaway battery doesn't charge, the left taillight blinks with the turn signal, and both brake lights are on with the taillights. Awesome job getting all the connections wrong, thanks. I really wanted to have to cut the plug off, buy another plug, and do it right."
5,Hopkins 7 blade molded trailer cable,"Cable worked perfect. This molded connector was sealed to the wire part of the cable.All copper wires and of the proper sizes. The eight foot length was just about right for my car trailer to truck application. Probably could have cut off one foot, but left it.Be sure to clamp the wire to the trailer so there is no tension on the little wires coming from the trailer. Grease all stripped copper wires before inserting them into a crimp type splice connectors. Use shrink tubing over the top of the connectors and shrink with heat gun. This will help corrosion from ruining the connection. I also put a little grease into the end of the connector where it would plug into the truck. When you unhook your trailer, face the connector end down so rain or dirt don't get in."
4,Nice cord but does not like cold weather.,"I like the cord being presided to the connector, but I found the plastic shield is very stiff if winter, almost to the point of not being able to use. Spend a litle more and get a rubber jacket if you are in the Midwest. Otherwise a great cordset."
4,"If you hurt no one, you've done nothing wrong.","Oglio Records rereleased Barnes & Barnes first two albums on CD. Those must not have sold well enough, because they didn't rerelease the rest of their albums. Instead, the third Barnes & Barnes release by Oglio Records was this ""best of"" CD. It features material from all their released albums and unreleased albums, plus newly recorded songs. Ten of the songs have never been released before. It's a good overview of Barnes & Barnes recorded output, from the sublime to the ridiculous. Fans of Art & Art need this CD. Yeah."
2,Disappointing collection,"I first heard their collection called Zabagabee: The Best of Barnes and Barnes in the early 90's and immediately fell in love with their music. If you can find that it would be worth your while. What I really don't understand is that this collection has about twice as many songs as that one did, and hardly any of the same songs. About 4 of the 24 tracks on this collection were on Zabagabee."
4,Woo!,"The only thing wrong with this CD is that it doesn't have the ""Three Drunk Newts"" song on it.Other than that, it's definatly a must for any fan of sillyness."
2,Guide to Catskill Trails,"This book was very imcomplete. It skimmed the surface of the hiking and camping situation in the catskills and would be suitable for only the most casual of hikers. There was not nearly enough information on the the types of camp sites, whether there are fishable lakes and what the regulations are for the region."
5,Why is the rest out of print?,"Here's a Boswell diary entry. 'Good heavens, what a loose did we give to amorous dalliance! ...In a moment I felt myself animated with the strongest power of love, and, from my dearest creature's kindness, had a most luscious feast. Proud of my godlike vigour, I soon resumed the noble game. I was in full glow of health. Sobriety had preserved me from effeminacy and weakness, and my bounding blood beat quick and high alarms. A more voluptuous night I never enjoyed. Five times I was fairly lost in supreme rapture... Louisa had an exquisite mixture of delicacy and wantonness that made me enjoy her with more relish. Indeed I could not help roving in fancy to the embraces of some other ladies which my lively imagination strongly pictured. I don't know if that was altogether fair... I have painted this night as well as I could. The description is faint; but I surely may be styled a Man of Pleasure.' (12 January 1763) Indeed. Get hold of this book immediately."
4,Boswell the biographer at the beginning,"I read this for background on Boswell before I tackle his biography of Johnson, and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The young Boswell's writing skills are on again/off again, but still the writer to come is evident. Boswell's London Journal outshines most any other journal you could read, and provides insight not only into the young (and maddeningly self-absorbed and trivial) Boswell, but also into a London culture that seems only remotely related to the 21st century western world.A must read for any Boswell fan, and a good read for anyone interested in late 18th century London society."
3,cute but not worth owning,"We rented it and it is cute, but not worth owning. There is a section toward the end of the movie which is a cheesy take off from transformers that really made the end disappointing. There are cute moves and the James Bond type gagets are funny. Not planning to add to the kid library of videos."
3,G-Force,Wasn't quite as good as I had expected considering who it was produced by. It could have been better.
1,Perhaps I am too old for these type of movies...,"I don't mean to be negative about it, but this movie is just another one of those ""let's put animals in the movie so that we can impress the kids"" but my son and his friends would not sit in the theater to watch the movie because it did not catch their attention very well. At first, they thought it was cool because the hamsters were talking, but then they just got bored. It is pretty sad when talking gerbils do not even thrill 6-year-olds... maybe animal lovers liked it?"
2,VERY GOOD CGI--VERY WEAK SCRIPT,"I would strongly recommend that you rent this film and view it BEFORE you decide to buy it. Most viewers, young or old, are unlikely to want to watch it twice.The animation of this little film is first-rate. What it lacks is a good script with characters who have some traits we can care about one way or the other. In only two brief passages, both near the ending, did this movie come to life.OVER THE HEDGE, KUNG FU PANDA, ICE AGE, MADAGASCAR, its sequel, MADAGASCAR--ESCAPE 2 AFRICA, and especially HAPPY FEET are examples of films with talking animals that do hold the interest of people of all ages and DO make us care what is happening."
3,They could make better with these cute creatures.,Every speaking animal films like this are not that great in the viewpoint of storytelling. Maybe it targets the youngest audiences in the film market. But they should remember that the person who brings them to theater is an adult and they also want a good story in his viewpoint.
2,Just Getting the Movie to Start is a WAR,"G-Force is a great movie, I highly recommend it, but wait for a better DVD Treatment.Allow lots and lots and lots of time to get the movie started.UOPs (User Operation Prohibition) are enabled on this DVD meaning that you cannot skip over many parts of the DVD and are FORCED to watch things you have no interest in.While it is easy to purchse a DVD player that overrides UOPs, there are no Blu-ray players that do this YET.Avoid this presentation of the movie. When a later one is released that is not hostile to the viewer, buy it only then."
1,"Cute kids movie, lousy product",I bought this as an entertaining video for elementary aged students. They liked the story despite the fact that the sound and video were completely out of sinc.
5,G-Force,"I have no kids, but I bought this movie for my husband and I and it was a very fun and cute little movie, so even if you don't want it for yourself, you would definately want it for your kids!"
4,Interesting Adventure Movie,"This is a really good adventure movie, With Gophers as the main characterswhich adds to the humour, 3D really enhances it"
3,Cute movie,"There are some kid's movies that are funny on both a kid and adult level (think Shrek). This movie, which is cute and occasionally funny, will mostly appeal to kids. The digital version is a nice bonus."
4,Great deal.,"My kids loved this movie, and like to take it in the car for long rides. So we still get blu ray quality and a movie we can watch in different rooms other than the living room blu ray! For a reasonable price!"
1,Big Disappointment,"I thought this would be an interesting kids movie, but it is not worth watching. Don't waste your time. Watch Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs instead! That movie has heart and is tremendously enjoyable. Not this big disappointment!"
3,Needs Heart,"G-Force was disappointing. As an adult, I was in the wrong audience age group. The story, such as it was, was long on explosions, action and impure, non-humorous jokes, and short on good acting and heart. It was probably made primarily for pre-teen boys. I didn't empathize or identify with the character's plights at all.The story was simplistic, about a misfit team of animals saving the world. Humans were depicted as dolts at the mercy of the animals' superior intellects. The acting, whether voice characters or live action, was tongue-in-cheek and dull, with the exception of Nicolas Cage's part. It seemed like they couldn't get into the story.When the movie was over I turned it off with a feeling that I had wasted my time and my money.I gave G-Force three stars because the animation is good."
1,Weak Plot & Bad Humor,"This was a poor attempt to sell a movie to kids with the technique of animal animation. The rodents were one-dimentional, unemotional, and failed to establish their own identity. Animals sell, and that is what the producer is counting on.The plot was weak and lack any credibility. This was just another ""animals being chased by the bad guys out to destroy the world"" movie. Haven't there been enough of them made so far? Why another one? The plot lacked a single ounce of creativity.The graphics were terrible, and void of modern technological advances. The movie relied on hyped up music and singing animals to provide any semblance of entertainment value. Weak!Finally the humor was terrible. The ""jokes"" were the type your 80 year old dad told 60 years ago. A little originality would have been nice.I hate to give a poor review to a kid's movie, but this one was bad. Even the kids I watched the movie with were bored.Save your money, avoid this movie."
5,Great for adults too - pure entertainment,I'm an adult and I loved this movie ! It's pure entertainment. I've seen it 3 times now.Some of the reviewers here on Amazon have given this movie low ratings. I'm baffled about this because this movie is very entertaining. The plot is clever and unexpected. The ending is a surprise.I recommend this movie to anybody that wants to watch something that is truly entertaining.
4,Actually quite good,"This was one of those movies that I avoided at the theaters when it first came out. But my children wanted to see it, so we rented it, and wow, was I taken back. This is actually a very funny movie. Starring mostly lesser name actors for the human characters, the guinea pigs are voiced by stars such as Steve Buscemi and Nicholas Cage. The story is quite a simple; two scientists develop technology that gives human intellect and speech to small animals such as flies, guinea pigs and moles. These upgraded animals are then used to fight international crime and terrorism. This movie is part action, part comedy, and part adventure. The special effects are kept low-key but they are effective, especially the movement of the animals. The dialog is quite engaging, with each of the animals having their own unique personalities, attitudes and slang. Best of all is the storyline, which keeps you guessing to the very last minutes of the movie. Overall, quite worth the watch."
3,three star,"This movie had a few cute spots, but was a tad boring! Not something i would care to watch again."
3,"Gee, Look","With great anticipation I bought this movie as it was on sale and the blue ray version to boot. Three disc set with digital copy, DVD, and Blu Ray disc. Ok, fine.Setting down to watch the wranglings of our fine, furry guinea pigs left me a tad overwhelmed. Yeah, it's got talking animals, yeah there are some funny moments, and yes there was a plot....sort of. This movie could have been so much more but gets bogged down by it's own hype. Kids will more than likely be attracted to this due to the talking animals. As an adult I was attracted to it as I was hoping to see something really funny. Perhaps the gag lines were held in check as they meant for this to be more for kids than adults. All-in-All, this movie was just OK, nothing great and kids older than 12 or so might find it a little boring as well. It's worth viewing but not buying. Save it for a rainy weekend and when nothing else is on the ol' tele!!"
4,Great Fun - get the bluray!,"My wife and I and our grandson really enjoyed this movie. The color is vivid, and the sound was great thanks to Bluray and Dolby Tru-Audio. We watched on our 95"" Widescreen 2.35:1 projection screen powered by Runco with Autoscope. Being in the Hi-Tek business I found it very interesting. The Micro chip thing in the appliance is reality. All of these things will be able to talk to each other and their masters via the internet with TCP/IP over powerline. So while it is fun as a movie it does make you think does it not?"
3,"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, No G-Force","For those who made the mistake of renting G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (See my review), you will notice the striking similarity of plots. The ending was also very similar. The real only difference in the movies was this one is actually for the family and occasionally fun and funny. If my Eleven Year Old were to review this movie he would have given it 5 stars. Good Family Purchase or Rental. Enjoy."
5,Good family movie,Great family enjoyment?. A little scary. A good story about being aTeam even if you are not special. Okay.
5,Cute and action,"I enjoyed this movie. action: yes, animation: very good, great for the kiddo. The story like has a loveable scientist working with animals. He tells them how special they are and how they were made for the job they were doing."
1,Phew...This movie stinks,"Well, on the positive side this movie was clean without too much crude humor. Of course it had the gas passing humor that you find in most films of this genre. Negatively speaking this has to be one of the most boring and stupid movies that I have ever seen. It just was lacking something. I never really cared if the rodents suceeded in their mission or not."
3,Excellent animation but unimpressive plot,"The animation (especially the hamster's fur) is well done, but the story is flat and cliche. If they ever make a sequel they need to improve the story."
3,Other movies have been better..........,"This movie was, well, ok. It was about 3 guinea pigs who work as spys kind of. there's this project to ""change the world"" or something with these appliances and they're trying to stop it. meanwhile they meet a new guinea pig who joins the group and one of the other agents gets taken away from them and then tries to destoy thr humans. but then everything works out and no one is hurt. so, i would reccomend other movies, but it was ok."
4,"Really good sutff, if not melancholic","I really like this album, and out of the 3 albums I have heard(this, Summer in Abbadon and Autumn of the Seraphs) this actually comes in last. But thats NOT saying anything bad. The complexties of their rhythms and melody are intact throughout, and this one is indeed very infectious. But I must say, they definitely get better after this one. I think ""Summer"" and ""Autumn"" are about on par with each other... That being said, I believe the only quibble lies in the fact that after Concrete Seconds it gets so melancholic that by the time XIY comes, its a true reilief, befoe it gets down in the depths again, right before the wonderful and majestic and arguably the top 3 of songs they put out, closer ""Tres"". This closes this outting so well, its so hypnotic that you just cant help but want to play it again. That melody will stay with you for some time."
3,Intellegent catchy ness,"3 1/2 starsThe repetition found throughout this disc leads to inspired head bopping serenity that doesn't quite sound, or effect, like anything else out there. At times overcome by their elaborate progressive-pop echo chambers, they often triumph in delivering that rare combination of quirkiness and melancholy, driven by a hungry ear from singer/guitarist in their layering tendencies inside the already intricate guitar and vocal layouts. Unabashedly melodic and quirky with subtly progressive undertones, Pinback can definitely help build some great bridges for some terribly dull music collections for alot of young listeners out there.."
3,Strong 1st Half,"This is a good album to lull me off to Dreamland. The first half is excellent, from the dreamy ""Concrete Seconds"" to the cinematic bassline of ""Penelope"" there isn't anything to complain about. ""Boo"" is the album standout and was the show-opener when I saw them live. The only problem is that the 2nd half of the album suffers from more-of-the-sameness, where none of the tracks really stand out from each other. This is pretty much how I feel about their first album as well (not much after Loro is worth listening to). So I suppose if you put the first halves of their first two albums together, you'd get a swell disc that could accompany you on rainy and sunny days, high ones and sober ones."
3,Almost Great.,"When I first heard ""Offline P.K."" I listened to it repeatedly. It was an excellent track that covered new musical territory with its layered vocals, soothing harmonies, and unusual production techniques. ""Offline P.K."" and the track that follows are alone worth the price of admission to this CD.My complaint: a good band traces new musical territory; a great band traces new musical territory and then probes deeply into that territory's boundaries. (check Built to Spill or ace-fu-label-mates Ex-Models). I feel that Pinback is basically content to stay near the center of their musical terrain, which makes most tracks on the album sound... about the same.Don't get me wrong, this is a good album and Pinback is a good band... but they're not yet at their creative peak. I look forward to their future releases."
4,A nice clean breath of rock...,"After becoming extremely jaded with the current emo-rock scene, Pinback's latest release, Blue Screen Life, combines acoustic guitar, enchanting vocals and riveting melodies into a healthy combination of indie and emo rock. Bright voices in the genre, the duo managed to put out a fresh release into the year without deviating from their previous style.The basic Pinback style remains intact: articulately picked guitars, dual vocal lines and sweet harmonies. While it can be argued that they did the same thing on their debut, this record helps to accentuate their skill as musicians and singers. Songs such as ""Boo"", ""Penelope,"" ""Talby,"" and ""X.I.Y."" particular come to mind as enchanting tracks with both musical and lyrical brilliance.In a year that was run by the re-emergence of a once-great emo-rock giant, Pinback's strong outing really rings out. Pick up the album as soon as you get the chance and prepare to be amazed."
5,Shrimp-lover's right arm,"I am a card-carrying shrimpaholic. Before I found this gadget life for me was different. I would cut corners like skip the deveining (yuck, I can't believe I did that!) unless the shrimp or vein was pretty large. Everyone who has ever eaten shrimp knows how tedious shelling is. This little tool is revolutionary. In one small swoop the vein and shell is gone, leaving only the tip of the tail. No kitchen should be without it."
1,Don't waste your money.,I got this thing and it worked good until the tip broke and rendered it useless within a few uses. You can get a dozen deveiners that work better for the same price.
5,Cleaning Shrimp made Easy,"I was skeptical when I first bought it.....my wife wouldn't even believe in it...Previously, we were reluctant to buy shrimp, because cleaning it with a knife is a hassle and takes a very long time. But, after cleaning a pound of shrimp with it, we are both convinced about the utility of this tool.The Oxo shrimp cleaner takes a little while getting used and then is a breeze. The rubber grip gives a nice non-slip grip and feels pleasant in the hand....I strongly recommend getting it."
1,shrimpboy,Buy a cheap curved knife from the dollar store. This item is all plastic and doesn't work very well.
2,Good for tearing the shrimp!,"This product only kind of works, I work in a 4 star restaurant called risottos and I have to clean 1,000's of shrimp on occasion. I was looking for something to expedite the process. This is supposed to make it so you can remove the shell and the guts all in one motion but the problem is that the teeth are not sharp and it ends up tearing the shrimp and ruins the presentation you are better off using a file knife."
3,Not the best Oxo product,"Oxo Good Grips makes some interesting kitchen gadgets, but I think this is not one of their finest efforts. Something about the blade - it's flexibility, the serrations, I'm not sure exactly what - make it work less effectively than it should. I got better results with the hard plastic cheapie shrimp tools, although I'm sure this should last longer.Mine got warped in the dishwasher, so I'm trying the Cuisinart next."
3,It's okay...,"I really really wanted to like this more than I do. I read all of the reviews that said how easy it was to use, then when I got it there was one comical looking cheesy picture showing how to use it. I am not a cooking novice, but I felt like a real retard trying to use this. Several mangled shrimp later, I finally got the idea, but still continued to mangle the occasional shrimp. And the thing is, I think it took me more time to mangle the shrimp with this thing than to peel shrimp manually. I gave it three stars because if you have a lot of tenacity, and you want to devein and that is really important to you, this will devein the shrimp nicely, if you don't mess up. I just find that this complicates things too much for me about two thirds of the time. Take this as you will."
3,it's ok,"This CD is quite ok, but it ain't jazz....It would be nice for background at a cocktail party, not disturbing the conversatio. If you like that, buy this cd, if you are looking for jazz, pass this one:)"
1,Don't buy this one!,"The first 2 songs are good indeed, but all the others are super-kitsch, really horrible, over, disgusting! Try to find the right CDs from this master. I had read the other reviews and bought this one, and now I feel like throwing it through the window."
2,Barfin',"There is no bigger fan of jazz guitar or rock guitar than me. I cut my jazz teeth on Wes and Grant Green. They are both great but this disc is not. It sucks you in at the beginning of nearly every track and then the strings come in and you just want to vomit. Did this stuff really sell in 1965? Elevator music in the extreme. Sorry Wes. Jazz fans, seek out the Fantasy Jazz titles. ""Incredible Jazz Guitar"" is the ultimate. All the others are good or great. Forget this turkey."
5,"A classic album! My favorite jazz guitar album! An audio ""hug""!","This is my favorite Wes Montgomery album (I have them all!), my favorite ""jazz guitar"" album (I also collect Johnny Smith, Herb Ellis, Tal Farlow, Barney Kessel, and others) -- and one of my favorite albums of all time (in a collection of over 2000 CD's and 2000 vinyl albums).There are some who are too narrow-minded to appreciate the strings -- well, there are many orchestra-less guitar albums out there for that minority. I love the strings! They turn Wes's bare trio into something warmer and richer! The strings turn these old 'Sixties chestnuts into something transcendant. Don Sebesky's string arrangements are top-notch and I would like to buy up every album Sebesky ever did.But the star is Wes! Such heartfelt guitar! Great choice of songs! I put on this album when I need a hug. It always warms my heart. It takes me to a place where there are no wars or religions or pollution. I may buy a second copy to keep in my car."
3,Lose the orchestration.,"Why doesn't someone in the industry put out a ""Bumpin"" CD minus the extra orchestration (just the original rhythm section with Wes)? They must have it since the arrangement was fleshed out later. In fact there must be gobs of great Wes stuff buried under all those those dated orchestral arrangement records he made. I love Wes Montgomery's playing but hate the fuddy-duddy arrangements. I have all his small combo stuff. It would be fantastic to hear some of his other stuff minus all the strings, etc.What a concept!"
5,A Great Fantasy,"Cary Conder has been able to take the old Arthurian legend and give it a fresh face. If anyone is looking for a good, clean fantasy novel without a lot of sex or violence, this is the story for them. Ms. Conder, thanks for giving us a new, interesting and family-friend fantasy author to read. Looking forward to more of your stories. Happy writing (and please don't take too long for the sequel.)"
4,More Please,Except for the numerous typos in the first book it was an excellent read and I could hardly wait for the sequel which was equally as good. I thoroughly enjoyed both books. Will there be a third? I hope so.
4,does what it claims,"It's a great product to clean something like potatoes, carrots and other root vegetables. Not so much for fruits like apples, or soft things like tomatoes etc."
4,"Definitely a ""Good Grip""","I have and have used at least 15 other vegetable brushes. All for the most part were decent. The OXO is a step above most but not perfect. The size is great for a small to medium size hand and adequate for a larger hand. The bristles are firm, great for potatoes, carrots, etc. I would recommend a second, softer brush for more delicate fruits and vegetables. Combined with a vegetable wash likeFit Fruit & Vegetable Wash, Soaker/Refill Bottle, 32-Ounce Units (Pack of 3)and you have an excellent 1-2 knockout punch for dirt, pesticides, bacteria, etc. Once you see the difference in just how clean your fruits and veggies are after you utilize your new secret weapons, you wont go back to hand rubbing, guaranteed!"
5,Great little brush,"I use this brush several times weekly to quickly clean carrots, potatoes, radishes and other root vegetables. It works wonderfully, is easy to grip and does not slip, and clean up is a breeze. Great product that fits right in the palm of your hand."
4,Vegetable Brush,Purchased it originally to clean vegetables. Happen to use it to remove the silk from corn on the cob. I thought it was the perfect brush to remove the silk. Left it at my daughter's home when visiting and cooking. Going to get me another one.
4,Does what I need it to,This works as advertised. I haven't had bristles fall out or anything wrong with it. There is nothing about it that makes be think it is better then any other brush but I don't expect a lot out of a brush just to do the job it is intended for.
5,Very good for firm fruits/vegetables and wax,"Very happy I bought this little brush for getting the wax covering off apples. Also use it on pears and potatoes and carrots. If fruit has gotten soft like ripe peaches, then it's a little too stiff, but the soft brushes won't really work on the hard stuff. So you really do need both."
4,Handy tool,"This is a great brush for use on vegetables. The bristles are stiff enough to scrape off dirt, but not as harsh as to damage. The size is just right and fits in the hand well. The rubber makes it comfortable and easy to grip without fatigue."
4,Good price + free shipping = no-brainer,"I bought this for $3.99 and the shipping on it was free, by itself. It feels secure in your hand and it has done a good job so far. I would not recommend that you use it as a replacement for a peeler, but it definitely deserves your consideration to scrub the dirt and chemicals from the outside layer of vegetables.The circular grip is something that will probably be hit or miss for some people, as would a long handle for other people. I like the ergonomics of this product and I think others would as well."
5,When it works it works,"Recently I've been switching out a lot of the stuff in my kitchen with OXO brand versions. Every time I try a new one out it just seems to work. Given there is nothing revolutionary about a vegetable brush but this one just works well. Its got an easy to grip surface, is ergonomic, and easy to clean. In the end thats whats important and OXO delivers on that."
4,This brush DOES IT ALL!,"Oxo Good Grips Flexible Vegetable BrushThe bristles are *more* than firm enough and the brush itself is designed to facilitate ease of use when cleaning fruits or vegetables.If we had one suggestion that would be followed, the brush would be just a little larger.Reviewers who comment on the bristles being too soft must want or need a steel-wool pad instead!"
3,Good for some things...,"I find this brush to be good for some things, but not for others. The bristles are too short to fit in the cracks and crevices of things like bell peppers, apple tops/bottoms and knobby or uneven root vegetables. At first, the bristles were much too stiff, but have softened up, with use. It is easy to clean and hold, especially for aching hands, but you still need another veggie brush for the things this one can't do. It works well for scrubbing cutting boards and the like. I would buy again, but it isn't the only one to own."
5,The Best,"Of the many vegetable brushes I've used over the years, this is the best by far. For years I've used the brand my mother used, even though it didn't do a very good job of cleaning vegetables and even though it wore out quickly. I accidentally came across this brush while shopping for a friend and figured I had nothing to lose. Am I ever glad I bought it: it fits my hand perfectly, is comfortable, and the brushes are strong enough to take the dirt off immediately---no scrubbing and scrubbing. For anyone who ever washes root vegetables, this is the one."
4,Great scrub brush for most vegetables,"It works very well for potatoes and most other veggies, but it kind of tears up mushrooms because the bristles are very stiff. The rubber grip is great to prevent slipping so you get better leverage when scrubbing."
4,Works OK,"Helps clean vegetables ok. Better than if just rinsing by hand. Nonslip grip is nice since brush is always used with water. May bruise mushrooms, but just go really light on them and they seem to do the job fine."
4,"Excellent product, takes a little breaking in",I love and trust the OXO brand and am more than happy to pay a bit extra knowing I'm getting a quality product and this little brush upholds my brand loyalty!The grip fits perfectly and comfortably in the palm of you hand and doesn't slip when you're running it under water to clean the veggies. The bristles are very stiff the first few times you use it (it actually took the skin off yams the first time) so I would suggest using it on firmer veggies before using on anything fragile like mushrooms or tomatoes.All in all GREAT product and I'll for sure stick with OXO brand for future purchases!!
4,Good but NOT flexible,"First of all, this is a very good vegetable brush. The bristles are quite stiff but work very well on all the vegetables you are likely to buy. The ""body"" of the brush is not flexible at all; it's made of a hard rubber or plastic material. It works very well though, and fits comfortably in my hand, much better than using a brush with a handle. I'd give it 5 stars except for the fib about being flexible."
5,A Great Brush!!,"I always thought vegetable brushes were created equal. Well, they're not!! This OXO Good Grips brush is absolutely wonderful!! I have a garden this year so have lots of carrots, beets, potatoes, turnips, etc. that need cleaning. This brush makes a quick, easy, and thorough job of it. Peeling is kept to a minimum because it does such a good job cleaning the vegetables. I highly recommend this product."
4,May not be his most original but it's still solid,Overall this is still an enjoyable album. The other reviews hold him to a very high standard but that doesn't necessarily mean that since it may not be his best it's not good. The sound is great. Terry Robb is certainly capable too. It's a good listen.
1,Lousy,I've listened to enough John Fahey to know this disk is way sub par. Terrible selection. Dull presentation. Very dissapointed with this disk.
2,Batmobile Pedal Car -- much too small,"Our grandson is barely four years and of average size for his age, yet the batmobile is much too small for him. For a kid who loves batman, it is intriguing and he did try to use it as he pretended to be the batman of his imagination. But after just 2 or 3 days, he gave up and returned to his tricycle. As a result, except for the initial 2 or 3 days of limited pleasure he got out of it, the batmobile has been a waste of money. On the other hand, for a child of 3, it should be fun, I think, for at least awhile."
2,Ad Misleading,"This item had a description for ages three and up. This isn't even close. Now I'm stuck with a toddler toy for a five-year-old who is so attached to the fact it's a Batmobile he can get in, even if his knees practically knock at his chin, that I'll never pry it from him. He's only going to be able to even get in it for probably two more months. It was a complete waste of money. It's suited for two to three-year-olds and small four-year-olds."
2,Very disappointed,The product description is very WRONG! They lie!!!!! The product is (...) to small. The car is for toddlers. The age limit should be 4 years old.
1,easily broken,"I would not recommend this product for anyone over 3 & 1/2 years (unless small for their age). My 4 yr old son (36lbs) got it for his birthday, and broke the steering wheel within 10 minutes. There is plenty of room for him on the seat and inside the car, but its been ""parked"" since broken. I wish we would have spent the money on something that would have lasted. The plastic seems cheaply made. The voice buttons and noises are loud and work well. Stickers have already started to flake/peel off after 1 month. Consider a bigwheel!"
2,Came Defective,"The concept is perfect. It is small but fit my bigger 3 year old okay. The pedal mechanism is difficult to master, but doable. The steering is for slight turns not any sharp turns. I rated this item 2 stars because the box was obviously opened prior to me receiving it. It most likely was a returned item. It was also defective with the metal rod for the pedal mechanism totally disassembled. I fixed it but then the other medal metal rod came apart as well. The product is very cheaply made, but the sound effects and look is perfect for a Batman lover. I have written to EToys, and I will see how they respond. My sons loved the car nevertheless."
3,Good intentions....bad plot,"I wanted to like this book, I truly did. But in the end, it left me completely unfulfilled.Here is my main problem with the book. Many novels, as does this one, start in the present and then flashback to the past to see how the protagonist actually made it to this current place. However, in order for this to work, a reader's attention must be grabbed at the very beginning to make us truly wonder and care about how things became the way they are. In this book, the present (as it starts out) is very bland and uneventful. The past, as we find out later, actually had some good twists and turns. However, by the time we get to the previous events, we really don't care about the main character or his predicament.While some of the descriptions are quite good and vivid, this short book will leave most readers completely unmoved."
3,EMPTY PROMISES,"I bought this CD based on previous reviews claiming that the CDB had returned to their ""roots"" of true southern rock and roll. What a disappointment. I am a true CDB fan from the beginning, catching many concerts back int he early 70's when they toured the south regularly and many times with the Allman Brothers. Although I agree that the playing on this album is better, cleaner and more inspired than on their recent albums, it primarily focuses on guitar rock. Several of the songs are simply not worth listening to and really only two live up to expectations. And if they have truly gone back to their roots, why is there not a single ""fiddle tune"" on the disk? It will take a true dedicated and devoted CDB fan to enjoy this offering."
4,"GOod, but sometimes cheesy","In each track of this album, there's a different band formation, composed of Gary's guest musicians like Glenn Hughes, Neil Carter & Phil Lynott. It contains big sucess of his career, like ""Out in the Fields"" and ""Military Man"". It's an irregular record, however, and it's not on of his best. THe subsequent ""Wild Frontier"" is more coherent."
2,Gary's pop metal album.,"RUN FOR COVER has the dubious distinction of having two of Gary's most pedestrian songs ever: the obnoxious ""Out Of My System"" and the abomination ""Listen To Your Heartbeat"". Also, the album has that loathed reverbed drum sound typical of the pop metal / hair metal bands of the eighties.But, since we're talking about master Gary Moore, you'll find some gems here. ""Military Man"" is a masterpiece, while the title track rocks harder than ever. This remastered version also has a good booklet containing the lyrics. Gary used different line-ups for each song, including hiring the services of Glenn Hughes to add lead vocals to some tracks.By a large margin, this is not his best hard / metal album."
5,One Of The Best,"This is one of Gary's hardest rocking albums. His playing as usual is superb and his vocals are far better than he is utilising today. Maybe part of the reason is the heavyweight guests backing him: Glenn Hughes and the late Phil Lynott. Both contribute much and it shows. Not a weak track to be found. Great sound quality. If you prefer the harder stuff to his blues excursions of late, this will satisfy. 10 Tracks/45.45."
2,Gary's pop metal album....,"RUN FOR COVER has the dubious distinction of having two of Gary's most pedestrian songs ever: the obnoxious ""Out Of My System"" and the abomination ""Listen To Your Heartbeat"".

5,I also have to...,"...chime in on this one, this may be my favorite Gary Moore album of all...including Thin Lizzy, Colosseum II, Skid Row, early solo stuff and whatever else is lurking out there. It's a bit of a toss-up between 'Run For Cover' and 'We Want Moore!', only because I saw the 1984 tour (opening for Rush on their 'Grace Under Pressure' tour). The live album is absolutely mind-blowing, as was GM in concert. For studio LPs, 'Run For Cover' has to take the biscuit. From out-and-out rockers to melodic ballads to in-betweeners (whatever happened to that series by the way?), it has something for everyone and bonus tracks too! The production is excellent, unlike a lot of 80s 'metal' albums. If you are uncertain as to where to start with Gary Moore, this is a good place. The live album DOES have a monster version of the Yardbirds' 'Shapes Of Things', so you may have a bit of a decision to make, but as I said if you need help choosing a place to start THIS IS IT!"
1,Disappointed,"I had read good things about this cutting board and I was disappointed to find that after 2 months it began to warp. It has never been sitting in water, we'd wash it and let it dry upright. Not sure what made this happen but hard to recommend based on this experience."
1,cracking already,"I was initially very pleased with this board, but it now has a small crack appearing in the edge. My last board lasted 20 years and it was half as thick as this one. I think that the wood was not aged properly by the manufacturer, hence it is developing a crack after less than a month. (I have treated it very well (oiling it with mineral oil and drying it with a cloth each time I wash it. A good board will last years when treated like this.) When the board is too cracked to use I will replace it but certainly would avoid this manufacturer."
1,Pro-Warp Board,"I read the negative reviews but I thought I am sure if I go extra mile caring for the board it will be fine as probably other reviewers did not. Wrong. Oiled it daily for the first week, then every few days thereafter. Slowly but surely began to warp. Had better luck with John Boos 16x10 maple board."
1,Horrible,Used this cutting board for 8 days before it warped. Rolls all over the cabinet now.Don't buy......get a plastic board or the cutting sheets that sell for about $1.00
3,cutting board review,"Calling anything ""pro"" doesn't make it so. This is a decent, household weight cutting board. Any professional, however, would laugh that the manufacturer thinks its for ""pro's"""
5,Salvation,Let me tell those people that are going to buy this book. the book speaks the truth. I was going through these very same steps.Still My God had enough mercy to forgive of all my sins. Satan will blind you spiritually and tell lots of lies. I know how it feels. I made up my mind to serve the Lord My Savior. He too can be your Savior. This is a good book. May God Bless You my friend.
1,Liars,Those five-star reviewers at the bottom aren't real teenagers. They're probably Mr. Jones writing good reviews for his own publication of insanity. I find that quite disturbing.
1,Save Your Money and Your Time,"The only thing in the movie that was good was the young boy in the movie has acting talent. The story was horrible, unreal, unreasonable, and just plan not believable. The sad thing is the nature of the mother's illness and its ""realistic"" impact on a family could have been a good dramatic story. This story was just so unreal."
5,Some Girls Europa XL Mix!!,"I already gave a review on cd 2 so I am going to keep it short and simple. The one reason you must buy this cd for is the Some Girls Europa XL Vocal Mix, it is a great mix that you must have!!"
5,an evergreen classic,"A beautifully rendered novel with high intelligence, captivating character, and cosmic soul. In many ways, Sylvia Engdahl's writings are the logical successors to Heinlein's derring-do tales of gifted individuals making a difference in human exploration of other worlds. But Engdahl's pace is more leisurely, reflective, and the tapestry she weaves may well outlast Heinlein's. Here, she introduces Elana, with a very special mission.... (For further exploits of Elana, and a crucially important argument for the necessity of space exploration right now, see Engdahl's The Far Side of Evil...)Although Elana is young, this is a novel for adults of all ages."
5,"I loved it 20+ years ago, and my kids love it now.","The cover says it is a Newberry Honor book. The story is copyright 1970. I remembered reading the book when I was in about 7th grade. I am now reading it to my 6th grade and 4th grade daughters. Once we got past the first chapter, they fell in love with it. It combines fantasy and science fiction by applying a twist of Clark's Law (""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."") while delving into the question of ""What sorts of goals are worthy of commitment and sacrifice?"" It is enjoyable on several levels. I would recommend some caution for children under age 10 as some of the concepts are sophisticated and things such as death and severe poverty are included."
3,Nice to see things from different perspectives...,"Elana is part of a highly advanced society, but they keep themselves secret to all societies below them- at whatever cost. During a mission to save a Youngling planet from another that is more advanced than it, Elana comes along, but she isn't a full-fleged Agent yet. Elana ends up working with her father and the boy she is to marry, as she helps try to perserve the planet with a native's help. What is science to Elana is ""magic"" to the people of this planet. We see things from Elana's viewpoint, the viewpoint of the invading society, and the viewpoint of the planet that is being invaded, who all have very different ways of thinking. Sometimes I felt the plot went off course talking about ""responsibility"" but otherwise, pretty interesting stuff."
3,hm...,"This book was...well, interesting. When I first picked it up, it seemed fascinating. But, once I got into it, it was slow. The plot was good, but nothing really memorable-it seemed old-fashioned...if that word can be used to describe plots. It didn't really get in touch with me. While it was good, it certainly wasn't the best."
4,A heavy duty tool,"If you are used to one of the newer lightweight levels that are so popular you might be surprised at how heavy this Johnson level is. Get your forearms in shape for this one. The sighting bubbles are not over sensitive and move in a smooth useful arc. Everything about this tool is heavy duty and substantial, and it's nice to see that ""Made in the USA"" stamp for a change"
5,Love it!,This item has changed my life! I've been married for many years and have never been able to get my husband or son to put the new paper back on the dispinser when they need a new roll. No more soggy swollen toilet paper on the counter anymore!! Just slide it on and your done!
5,This is alot better than you guys say!,"Why do you all say that this is such a bad album? I have over 400 CD's in my collection and this is one of the most listened to albums in the whole collection, it's an excellent album, me and my girlfriend love it, the songs all have a purpose, people that are saying this is a [...] album probably have no particular love for music, so Tea party fans, don't listen to everyone else saying that this is a [...] album...it is a very very good album, i'd recommend this to anyone! (I'd also recommend all other Tea party albums!)"
1,Sonic Fodder,A lackluster effort that was shelved within a week. This band is capable of so much more that it hurts to listen to this release.
2,quick review,"It has already been said, ok rock album, but disappointing release from such an innovative & talented band. As far as the guy who said Bob rock was a good choice, Bob Rock = bad albums, i.e. Metallica & Our Lady Peace."
1,What happened?,This band has taken every bit oftalent and originality they had and thrown it all away in favor of Tom Morello guitar riffs. They sound like a bad(der)version of Audioslave. RIP.
1,SELL OUT'S,THE TEA PARTY SHOULD BE ASHAMED FOR RELEASING THIS SUB PAR PEICE OF TRASH. THIS CD IS RADIO TEA PARTY AT BEST. WHERE IS THE GREAT GUITAR WORK THAT WAS PROMISED? NOT ON THIS CD. ALSO WE DON'T NEED TO HEAR STP'S INTERSTATE LOVE SONG'S GUITAR RIFF AGAIN AS FEATURED ON THE TRACK THE SEVEN CIRCLES. THIS CD IS A CLONE OF EVERYTHING PEOPLE DON'T WANT THE TEA PARTY TO BECOME LIKE EVERY OTHER BAND THAT HAS NOTHING LEFT TO CONTRIBUTE EXCEPT TO SELL OUT . BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME GUYS FROM A VERY ANGRY FAN!!!!
3,"It's good, but I expected a lot more from Tea Party.","Is this a great rock cd - maybe, it is definitely a good one. Is this a great Tea Party cd - NO."
5,BRAVO !!!,"I am a HUGE HUGE fan of Jean Luc Ponty. I discovered his music in the early 1980's and this man has my heart. I have all of his albums, and to me, they are my treasured gold. Anyone who can appreciate Jazz Fusion has to listen to his brilliance. Simply amazing, simply stunning. Give it a listen !"
5,THE BEST PONTY ALBUM,"I love this album. This was when Ponty was at his best. Steve Smith & Daryl Stuermer both add to this album. My favorite song is Trans-Love Express, the second-best song by Ponty (only to New Country on Imaginary Voyage). No words can describe the mood I feel when I listen to this music."
5,Awesome Road Music,"In the 80s while in the Air Force I did a lot of cross-country driving and ""Enigmatic Ocean"" was one of my favorites for the long haul. That cassette got a lot of play time (thank goodness for auto-reverse!). This is one fantastic CD. Get this along with Al Di Meola ""Elegant Gypsy"" and Return to Forever ""Romantic Warrior"" and you won't be disappointed."
4,"Small, But Nice Gift Basket","I purchased the Sunflower Gift Basket a few weeks ago and was shocked at how big the basket was. However, this basket was not so big, so naturally I was a little disappointed. It is a very nice, but small gift basket. I would not pay the original price for it, by no means, but it is well worth the $4.99 that I paid. It will make a very nice gift for those occasions when you don't want to spend a lot."
4,One of the greatest warnings for the future of America,"Many reviewers have said this can never happen in America.They have been disillusioned. It is those women who say that this many never can happen who are the ""Aunts"" of this book.Many aspects of this book remind us of the woman's life in many Muslim nations. People say that will never happen with Christianity, please remember that there are fundamentalist nutsos in every religion. In this book The President, Congress, Government were eliminated, killed. This book makes every woman treasure the freedoms and choices she has. This book is also a warning for men. Many posters on this board suggest men wouldn't care about this novel----how many men do you know that would stand for not being able to make love to a woman, look at a woman, talk to a woman, touch a woman?I urge every woman, man and teen to read this book. Open your mind. Open your heart."
5,Dystopia of too much zeal,"This book appalled me- in a good way. I found the concept of a patriarchal dystopia where women are forced into inescapable castes so disturbing that this book still comes to my mind very often. Atwood did an amazing job portraying a society in which a woman's value is determined by her fertility, which leaves her with no access to education, career options, or personal goals. This book also portrays a great irony of the more zealous aspects of feminism; there is such a thing as being too protected from danger."
5,Excellent!,"Loved this book! Not so much because of the theme, but because it was beautifully written, well-constructed, and full of suspense. Anything could have happened in the story and I kept reading in anticipation. Very exciting, continuously unfolding story told by a fascinating character. Can't wait to try another of Atwood's novels!"
2,A long nap,"This book was an absolute bore. I kept waiting for the peak which just never came. Overall, such a disappointment."
3,Satire?,"This book is seen as a satire in my opinion and was labeled and instant classic. When I read it in 2000 it was in the classic section of the library. This is a topic about how a government can become too religious. It is good to separate church and state o prevent something like this from happening. This had adult topics in it about extra marital affairs, a married woman allowing her husband to impregnate another young woman and keep her as concubine. This reminds me of a cult or something which is a good example of what not to do and what the world would be like if we allowed fanatics to go too far."
4,The Handmaid's Tale,"Macabre and dark, this novel about life in post-apocalypse America is far-fetched, but somehow fascinating and strangely believable. History you hope will never happen."
4,it was really good in an unusual way,"This book starts off kind of confusing but after the first 100 pages it starts to pick up. It's not like most book because you don't read for the plot or action or because your attached to the character. Its just interesting to read. I was a little dissapointed with the ending, but not because of the loose ends, it's the kind of book you want to keep going and giving more information that not even revelant."
3,Interesting,"I had a little familiarity with this title before I read the book. The story is interesting as a description of a alternative future, based socio-politico issues from yesteryear and continue today. I suppose some people might find the feminism issue thought provoking. As a woman of color, I am generally less struck by the feminism issue, experiencing the racial issue more profoundly anyway, and that society wants to have it all ways, is not surprising to me, as it seemed to be to the Handmaid and expect acceptance and cooperation from the oppressed. Nevertheless, as sci fi, it was an interesting read of a future history that one should beware."
1,"Disappointing dystopian ""satire""","Very disappointing after such epics as Life Before Man. The plot was complicated and character development was minimal. Disjointed prose made it difficult to read, as did the never ending time shifts. Atwood's ideas, although possibly relevant when the book was published, are now outdated in this post-feminist era.Surely the theme, although horrific, is not as bad as it seems? When their is a choice between sufferance of the living and the quality of life of future generations (and if there is to be one), surely this makes the issue undebatable.If you want to read the book, then good luck. The film version is also Ok, if unfaithful to the actual text.PREPARE TO BE SHOCKED, CONFUSED (AND SOMETIMES BORED)IF YOU READ THIS BOOKER PRIZE NOMINATED TOME. OTHER DYSTOPIC NOVELS ARE BETTER.........."
1,waste of time,"If I could have given this book no stars I would have. What a waste of time - it was as boring and repetitive as anything I've ever read. I'm a woman and I suppose I should have identified more with the underlying message, but all I could see was the insult to my gender. I finished it ony because my daughter is taking a literature class in college, it was assigned reading for the class, and I promised her I would read all the books so we could discuss them. Had it not been for my promise, I would have stopped reading after the first 20 pages. Yuck! This is my first Margaret Atwood book, and if it's representative of her entire body of work, I'll never read another one."
1,Stilted Polemic,"When observing the puppet-characters of this novel, the strings are always visible, for they have but one reason for existing - to implant the attitudes of the author in a new generation. The far-fetched setting also has one reason for its creation - the same. Wherever the reader looks in this novel, he or she sees the uneffaced hand of the author, for this entire polemic exists exclusively as a pulpit for Margaret Atwood to pound out her bigotry against religious people. The Handmaid's Tale is the literary equivalent of Ayn Rand - but with hate instead of philosophy. As a piece of literature, it is stilted."
1,"Dull, far fetched",A book based on thought process should somewhat resemble what one is actually like.
2,"This book could have been great, but wasn't.","I had read the amazon reviews and was looking forward to this book, but after reading it I was really disappointed. The story was good, but it felt underdeveloped and immature -- by the end of the book I was more irritated with Offred than sympathetic. The characters were shallow, at best, and overall it just didn't seem to come together. The idea was certainly interesting and the book had all the potential to be really powerful, but it just ... wasn't."
5,A Brilliant Literary Work,"This last year, I had to read this book for an ""independent reading project"" that my AP English teacher assigned. At first when I heard the title I was thinking about how dull the book would be, about some handmaid to some person... ""How exciting..."" However, being as how I'm interested in stories with a female protagonist, I was still willing to at least give the book a try. Instantly I was hooked with in the first few pages, already brewing questions as to what exactly is going on and why things are as they are portrayed. Margaret Atwood was able to set a great story with the perfect setting and a plot that twists in such ways that can leave you asking questions until the epilogue. Even then I found myself still asking questions. I highly recommended book."
2,It just goes on and on,"This was a difficult book for me to get through. I felt like I had to read every page (waiting for something to happen that never did). I think it would have been great if it was a short story, but as a novel, it was just too longwinded. The descriptions of things just went on and on.I thought it would be more exciting. I have read numerous dystopian novels and enjoyed Hunger Games and Enclave. I think I was looking for something more like them, and this book is NOT. It is more like The Road but without anythign ever happening."
3,The handmaid's tale,"While I found this book quite interesting, I have to say that for me, after all is said and done, it was also quite forgettable. Truly original and well written but not something I would read again or recommend to my friends. After reading the reviews for it I was expecting to be totally swept away and that never happened. Definately a chick book."
4,An unsettllng story,"A great story although quite unsettling at times. A story, set in the future, about a want to be perfect society gone wrong. About the control of many by a few. An unknown society for most Americans (other than our political system) but probably not so far off for other current societies around the world."
2,"Not very good, but okay","Atwood deserves to be on the Wall. Just kidding, but basically, the book put me to sleep. I disliked the way she kept flashing back and forth between her memories and the present time. The ending left you hanging, which I REALLY HATED. If I hadn't been forced to read it, I never would have given it a second glance. The movie is better."
2,I hated this book,This book was flat and boring! I hated the character especially Offred. I don't know what message Atwood was trying to send and by the end of the book I didn't care.
1,"Ridiculous, unlikely, feminist paranoia","Before reading this, you should know that this book is extremely anti-Christian, and full of nonsense. This is a future world where very few women are fertile, and ""Christian"" religious right men are in charge. Because so few women can have children, those who can are used as ""handmaids""-essentially, they have babies for the men and their sterile wives. Now, there is no mention in this novel of why egg donors and implantation aren't used, or why fertility treatments aren't employed. There are also women used as prostitutes-those who are defiant about the existing order. This is a paranoid feminist novel, one completely unlikely to happen, and one that will piss you off to read. It isn't even a good story. I had to read this for school and hated every minute of it. There is no truth in it, just a rallying cry for NARAL. If you're conservative like me, skip it. It will only make you angry."
2,Tries too hard,"The story, IMO, tries too hard to gross out the reader. Plot is all over the place, and though I have read more than 60 percent of the novel on my Kindle Fire, that's the best I can do. I enjoyed the frequent wordplay in the novel, but that couldn't carry me through the whole novel."
2,It was ok.,"For some reason I found this book kind of boring. I understand her life was boring, and that all she had to look forward to was a sneaky romance. The reality of this to ever happen in the future is unrealistic. It's a story to be easily forgotten."
3,"Scary futuristic plot, but a little dull","As a whole, this book was a scary way to depict the future as a ""my way or the highway"" world. But as a story, it took me a little while longer to get through than most books. It's plot kind of drops off into a lull in the middle. Just not what I expected."
3,Original,"Of course this is a classic. It is a lot for all women to think about, and will definitely put you in touch with your inner feminist, no matter how it might be buried these days. The movie with Robert Duvall is even better than the book!"
1,the handmaid's tale,"Could not get into this book and after the first chapter - I put it down. Rarely, do I not finish a book that I have started"
1,"Waste of time to read,","I read because of a book club that I am a member. The book had no positive themes within in it. Not realistic as a futuristic fantasy. Ending had no resolution, and so on,and so on! I would not recommend."
2,Not a big fan,"I didn't think it was that great. Atwood is a good writer, and there are some beautifully written passages in the book. Overall it was hard for me to get through. Mostly, the lack of logic in the plot annoyed me. And I got really sick of the narrator character. Basically the whole book takes place inside her imagination, which is a place I would rather not be. She didn't seem very smart, and I thought she was a pretty boring and weak person. Also, I'm not a big fan of reading about racey infidelity.Also, I prefer stories about people attempting to fix their problems instead of just whining about them. I know that negative stories can often teach us things. But I don't feel I gained much more than a headache from reading this particular story."
1,Ignorant,"This book has been made into a cheesey ""opera"". That should tell you everything you need to know about this book.The plot follows. An extremist religious group gains control of the US military and overthrows our government. They then establish their own theocracy where women have no rights and they persecute members of other religious groups, not much unlike modern day Iran (2002). If you don't know why this is not very imaginative and laughably impossible you need to spend more time in reality and less time in fantasy land."
1,Horrible,"This boook was just horrid. I will admit that it was well written, but it is not meant for high school students to read. I am a Junior and I was required to read it for my Honors English class and it was just too crude. It talks a lot about sex and is just too harsh for young ears or for any ears really. It seems as if all our culture revolves around anymore is sex and having a Junior English class read it just validates that statement further. If you want to crowd your mind with pornography related scenes and just plain filth then read it, but I advise you not to and to not recommend it to anyone else."
4,An interesting dystopia,"The story is told from the perspective of a woman whose life utterly changed in her mid-twenties due to a gov't coup in the US that left the executive and legislative branches dead. A totalitarian regime is put in place that controls women as breeding resources. The only thing that really bothered me about the book was that I found the timeframe unbelievable, that in 5-10 years society could be completely upheaved to where people accept this new power structure and imposed religiousness. I kept feeling it'd make a better story if the main character was one generation removed from the coup, but so much of the story as delivered depends on the woman's experiences pre-coup. I, too, was disappointed in the open ending; though the fictional ""historical notes"" addendum gives you some indication of what happened after the story, you still don't get any specific indication of what eventually happened to the main character."
5,"Sexism, classism, and public executions in the Christian Utopia of Tomorrow!","The United States has become a Huckabee-meets-Palin Utopia, a WASP military dictatorship based on a racist Protestant reading of the Bible. Women are property, illiterate, and subservient.The white military elite engage in the erotics of Scrabble and dressing up in cheap costumes. Unfortunately, nobody seems to be happy, which is odd, since one would expect a little more glee and togetherness in the American Christian Republic. The public executions and rampant classism (Hello! Econowives!) also make it a not-so-nice place to live.Instead the reader is shown that this utopia is nothing more than a dark mirror to theocratic tyrannies like Saudi Arabia, Utah, and North Korea (with Kim Jong-il treated like a god).A highly recommended book to give to all your conservative Christian friends and co-workers."
4,Fear the Future,"This novel, the first I have read by Atwood, captured my attention quickly with its first person narrative and distict jumps in time. The confusion I sometimes felt as the audience, is nothing compared to the confusion and horror protagonist Offred goes through. I am not a fan of sci-fi yet I thought the futuristic vision Atwood creates of humanties inhumanties as chilling. The Republic of Gilead claims to honor women in their enforced creation of a sisterhood. What this futuristic government accomplishes is degrading women even more so than the violent rapes women were experiencing in pre-Gilead days. An excellent book for a women's discussion group."
5,An extremely well written book!,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was one of those books you get so wrapped up in that when your done reading it you are depressed because its over. This book took over my life in some ways and made me look at everyday life without the blinders on that we all have. Margaret Atwood is a truly respectable writer.She knows what the reader wants and what they don't expect.This book was a interesting adventure.If her other books are as admirable as this one, she will have a new fan!"
5,Book Club BOok,This is suppose to be a really good book. I haven't had the time to finish reading it. I know that book club loved it.
3,Lacks any definite resolution,"This book was great.. while I was reading it. When I got to the end, I sort of shook my head and said ""yah, so what was the point?"" Atwood seems to be trying to make a commentary on gender and sex roles in this novel, but I don't think she quite makes it there. I was hoping that the end of the book would see the handmaid running from her master or throwing herself into her role or ... something! Instead the novel just kind of peters out and nothing really comes of it. Too bad, because there could have been so much more there."
3,Overrated,I found this book average. I think the concept is good but The author is selfish with the information provided and at times I lost interest.
1,Sorry to hear that Atwood sold out...,"I thought that she was a superb author until I found out about her acceptance of the Dan David award for $10 million at Tel Aviv University. I thought she was an anti-colonialist and anti-racists. The book is good, but it turns out the author is a bad person. You can't pick and choose which certain racisms, certain colonial-settler projects, are more acceptable than others. What a disappointment! Shame on you, Atwood!"
3,Satan was her editor!,My first question is What does Atwood have against God! What a terrible book against Religon. Satan was truly Atwoods's editor! THUMBS DOWN ALL THE WAY
1,Firewood is cheaper,"As an undergrad in college I was required to read this novel for an English course--go figure. From what I remember the story is centered around a woman who is caught up in a theocratic regime which takes over the US, and she is forced to abhorrent things like have men in the administration sire children through her.Looking back now, the situation described in the novel reminds me more of the Stalin regime than any type of theocracy I can think of, even the kind they have in some muslim countries (Yevgeny Zamyatins ""We"" comes more to mind--Stalin admired that novel). In fact, the ""abhorrent"" situation I described above is not much unlike the ""Lebensborn"" program (a.k.a. ""human stud farm"") which Heinrich Himmler used to propagate the ""Aryan"" race during the Third Reich. And you youngsters who have been brainwashed into believing that Hitler's government was Christian, you ought to read up on the occult roots of Nazism (see e.g. Peter Levenda's book)."
1,Why I did not enjoy The Handmaid's Tale,"I am an average reader. I read The Handmaid's Tale as a school project. I found it to be poorly written and incredibly boring. The book doesn't have much of a plot, the character development is amazingly poor, and the author's use of sensationalism was really quite revolting. The author seems to say, ""This is what will happen if we let those damn Republicans in office!!"" Personally, I don't mind hearing the message once or twice, but it is repeated over and over throughout the 400 pages of this horrible book. I can see how a leftist feminist might enjoy this book, but I don't think it is possible for anyone else (including the entire male gender) to enjoy this book."
1,What a waste of money and time!!,"I saw a recommendation for this book in one of the threads on the Kindle discussion board; my bad for buying based on the majority of good reviews and not even trying a sample first!Good grief, what a waste of time and money - I may have read a worse book, but if I did, it has blessedly left my memory. I struggled through 50% of this piece of garbage; really only kept reading that long hoping something would happen to give it some redeeming value since I'd paid for it - no such luck.Lesson learned."
1,No,"I personally believe ""Best Sellers"" should be decided by how many people actually WANT the book.And just because a book is a classic doesnt mean its any good."
2,The Handmaid's Tale: A Novel,"I found the writing style abrupt and rigid. I did not like the way information was given to the reader. It was difficult to follow at times. Though the topic was very disturbing, it was an interesting insight to the possibility of a police state. This book was chosen for a book club read and though I did not like the book it will certainly make for a good book club discussion."
3,I've read better,"It was o.k. I liked it some parts were funny, but it seemed like the same old thing. Book about the terrible things that might happen in the future if we don't clean up our act. I totally compared it to ""The Giver"", but ""The Giver"" was better. The ending sucked."
3,it wasnt that bad i guess,"ive read better. but i read it for school and for a school book i dont guess it was bad at all. but as a recreational book, its not one of the best. i did recommend it to my girlfriend. i think its worth reading, it has its ups, but it has its downs too. it leaves a lot to wonder about, but a sequel would definitely kill both books (the original and the sequel). i didnt really want to give it 4 stars, and i didnt really want to give it 3 either. but its more a strong three than a weak 4. so im going to leave it at 3. sorry."
5,Just as relevant as when I first read it 15 years ago,"With the rise of fundamentalist extremism in America, it's not difficult to imagine the scenario fictionalized in The Handmaid's Tale. A religious and militant state is a frightening thought, but presented in a very plausible fashion. It is certainly a gripping read, as well as a cautionary tale."
2,Review of the handmaid's tale,"According to my opinion the handmaid's tale by Margaret Atwood is not worth reading. The general idea of the novel is not bad at all, but the style of writing is very boring. For people who are not interested in depressing dystopias it's a waste of time to read it. The story is often confusing and incoherent. Also the fast changing time levels make it hard to read.Even though it was a torture for me to read it (at school), the topic of the book makes quite sense as we all live in a fragile society and it is not unrealistic that we might end in a world described in the book. So that's why i gave two stars of five."
2,Ultimately flat and boring,"While I agree with many reviewers that the subject matter is interesting and perhaps relevant to today, where women are stripped of rights in some places in the world, I did not like this book. As a result of her situation, Offred's character holds herself distant from the world around her. While a reasonable response to a screwed-up world, her narrating is just as distant and flat and I found myself not really caring what happened to her. The plot moved very slowly, and I wound up reading the plot synopsis on Wikipedia just to see if anything better is coming. It doesn't appear so, and so I'm not sure if I'll even bother with the last few chapters of the book."
2,"By the end, it was impossible to continue...","When I first started reading, I enjoyed the beginning. It captivated me and I expected a really good, developed story. However, as I continued, the monotany and general boredom took over my thoughts and the book became a horrible chore to read. Margaret Atwood also drove me up the wall with her lack of astounding vocabulary. She never diversified her words. By the end of the novel, I was thoroughly disappointed and I refused to read the historical notes. I didn't feel like going through the epitomy of boredom for another 20 pages."
3,"Interesting, but. . .","This book had a shocking and interesting idea behind it, but the actual story was somewhat lacking. While the idea of Womankind being totally subservient to men is appalling, it definitley keeps the reader riveted. That said, I found myself wanting to know more about who Offred was before she was a Handmaid. What was her real name? Her daughter's? I realize that the reason Ms. Atwood did not share those details was because Offred was basically supposed to be Everywoman, yet in a sense I felt a little cheated after I finished this book. I thought that the ending was totally lacking. What ever did happen to Luke? Offred? Was she pregnant? I would not recommend this book to anybody who dislikes cliffhanger endings."
2,Fnord,"The first part just plain sucked. The thought that our world could degrade to such a point is simply pathetic. Suspend the constitution, Oh Puhleeeze! Afterm page 200 it gets better and things start to fall into place. But you have to read the historical notes for it to make any sense at all. ""NO sir, I don't like it."""
3,Misinterpreted,"I fail to see how people classify this work as a feminist novel. As a matter of fact, there are several places where the author makes some acerbic jabs at feminist theory and actions. The future presented in this book is not necessarily totally a fundamentalist extreme- it also takes feminism to its extreme, with the idea of ""protecting"" women from everything- even themselves, in the end.The other thing I see often complained about regarding this book is the characterization. I found it to be refreshing in that the characters weren't overly strong or daring- they were normal people, with doubts and fears, anger and loneliness. I could identify with Offred's reactions to certain things, and that made the book, which dragged at times, easier to get through.I think I see this as more of a warning about how all extremes are bad than a feminist or antiChristian rant. You just have to read this one carefully."
3,I expected more,Knowing that this is a highly rated classic I was very excited to read it. The main character jumps around so much that I had a hard time trying to relate to her at all.
5,A most excelently cautionary tale!,Margret Attwood stuns in this story of the oppression of women and brings to light all of our duty to preserve the basic freedoms from those that would steal them from us in the name of safety and security.
4,Women against Women in a Patriarchal Society!,I thought the book was really well done and prosaic. It was so truthful as well. The stakes in this novel are very silent because it's more about the events that occur before and after than really about an actual edge of your seat plot. She makes a brilliant satire of todays world but it isn't plot centered. It's centered around the setting of the novel. It's world dictates the actions of everyone in it. The women turn on each other when they realize that men have the control. Men take them in to have meaningless sex. It's all so relevant.
5,Even if you don't like to read fiction...,"Years ago I picked up this book. I don't know why. Something about the cover art. Then I noticed the Table of Contents appeared decidedly different from any other I had seen. Intrigued, I started reading and couldn't put it down.In many ways, I'm a typical guy when it comes to reading fiction. I'd rather read a manual on roadbuilding or microbiology than the Lord of the Rings. Sad but true. I won't bother rehashing the characters and plot as you can get that from all the other reviews here. But this book was chilling, scary and pulled me in.I'm writing this review today because I'm recommending--make that buying--a copy of it for my most awesome friend, Trisha, who is giving the gift of life, as a surrogate mom to a lovely young couple.Go Trisha.PS: Don't waste your time on the movie."
5,Atwood at her best,"When I first year this book as a 14 year old highly devote protestant, I was utterly disgusted and thought Atwood was making a personal attack on my faith and the faith of thousands of other. Now as an upper year University student, this book has taken on completely new meaning for me. Rather than attacking Christianity, or any faith at all, Atwood masterfully blends together elements from past religious traditions to produce a chilling dystopian warning of what is possible in our world. She is not attacking Christianity directly, as she herself openly admitts. Instead, she elaborates on things that have already ahppens and projects a nightmarish future possibility. This novel is clasic Atwood, written with her usual sharpness and eloquence. perhaps more so than any of her other books, this novel grips the reader from start to finish. However, it isfar more than justa thrill read, leaving the reader with much to mull over in her abrupt and provocative ending."
5,"Chilling, thought-provoking","THE HANDMAID'S TALE is a tale that needs to be read. This one by Atwood is not simply a work of feminism, as some try to portray it. It's a work also (I would say primarily) of secularism (or the artful plea for more of it). In a post 9-11 world, can anyone ever again say that religion taken to its logical extreme doesn't hurt anyone? Maybe fundamentalists think it hurts only women and that that's all right. Just as the nightly news proves them wrong, sadly night after night these days, Atwood will prove them wrong, too, only more poignantly."
5,"Really, really good. One of my favorites.",Made an impact on me. Pushed me against the wall and forced me to think. ^_^
4,Great!,"Margaret Atwood presents a chillingly convincing futuristic story of sexual slavery in the former United States in this tour de force in the mold of Brave New World. Offred leaves the house once a day to attend market and lies with the Commander once a month to procreate in the new Republic of Gilead. She can recall a different life when she had a husband, a family, a job and money of her own. The Handmaid's Tale, a, is infused with biting humour and topical commentary, in the best science fiction tradition."
1,repeat and repeat and repeat again to make sure we understoo,"boring, repeatedly boring, nothing new, nothing bizarre, How come people are amazed by this book don""t they know anything about History ? Atwood is not inventive, besides if you have time enough count the few words she uses...always the same. Atwood is not a great writer, she is merely a writer. A boring dystopian novel...already written by others in a real better way. Don't read it better ACT."
1,A novel to be reckoned with,"This novel is one of the dreariest novels I have ever read. It even goes into describing the flies on the wall. I had to read this novel for my English class in my final year of high school and I would sure feel sorry for the poor buggers that still have to read it. Im sorry Atwood, but you're a dreamer. Your day dreaming when you write hardly does your hypothesis any justice. My advice to readers is to read things that are presented that way you would like to read them. If you have no life, go ahead and read all of Atwood's novels."
1,"A dull, unremarkable look at the future","A very boring book that has some interesting ideas but unfortunately fails miserably in bringing those ideas together. Atwood may be a good writer but her writing talents are spent here. In Offred, she creates a very pathetic character that is too uninteresting for the readers to care about what happens to her. I could not wait for this book to end, although I applaud Atwood for her creativity. This book belongs in the 70s when the feminist movement was taking shape. In the 90s, it is outdated. If anything, this book is NOT timeless. ""The Handmaid's Tale"" is a waste of paper that should have been written by a better writer or as a better story."
1,Maybe I just don't get it.........,"First of all, this book was so difficult to get into that I almost gave up on it. But then again, I don't like science fiction.The only way to spice up this boring, ridiculous story was for me to pretend it was from a different world, such as a Star Trek episode. Then it just became funny.I was not moved in anyway with this book, except for possibly lightly humored. It was not disturbing because it was so laughable and unrealistic. The most disturbing thing was the bizarre nightclub scene, because it seemed to be just thrown in there to be provacative, which unfortunately, it wasn't.Just wasn't my cup of tea at all. Sorry."
1,Boring and derivative. I want my money back.,Boring anti male story of a nazi like society in the US where women are forced birthing slaves. As if any man would ever want to live in Atwoods world. Very sloooow book. I cannot disagree more with the positve reviews. I want a refund. Totally derivative of Orwell with characters you wont care about. Many other near future sci fi books are much better. Dont waste your time with this one.
3,"Interesting book, but mediocre characters","I found Offred's character not to be terribly developed. I felt that she was to fulfill that Everywoman function too much leaving her seeming almost generic. Moira had the potential to be an amazing character, but never really got out of that Strong-willed Man-Hating Lesbian sort of stereotype.Another example - Atwood missed an incredible opportunity to explore Luke's character more fully, especially in relation to Offred after her freedom had been taken away.The plot itself I found really interesting, but the lack of character appeal made me much less sympathetic to the women's plight."
2,Trite and unrealistic.,"The blurb on the back of my copy reads something like, ""...Atwood takes today's trends and extends them to their chilling and logical conclusions...""Excuse me, what? This book in no way convinced me that American society would end up in the bizarre '1984'-like ripoff presented here. To even suggest this as the logical future is completely shortsighted and ignores all advances women have made towards equality in the past hundred years or so.The entire book reads as an extremely heavy-handed attack on sexism. It fails to conjure up a realistic society, its characters defy common sense and reason, and it even falls flat in illustrating an interesting love story. The themes presented here have been analyzed a dozen times in far more interesting and coherent books. Skip this one."
2,handmaid's tale-really worth reading?,"In my opinion ""The Handmaid's Tale"" by Margaret Atwood is a rather annoying lecture if you are not interested in the issue of dystopias and totalitarian states.Lenghty and very detailed descriptions of the everyday life of the protagonist might force the bravest readers to surrender.The basic idea, however,is well chosen and the topic offers a lot of potential to create a disturbing and even horrific vision of the future. Atwood delivers with her novel a new aspect in the various dystopias of the 20th century: the tyranny of a fundamental christian sect.Considering all these aspects one could remark that the artistic realization leaves a lot to be desired.But the final question,if the handmaid's tale is really worth reading is difficult to answer.If you are interested in becoming acquainted with dystopian novels you will be more content with one of the classic dystopias, such as Orwell's ""1984"" or Huxley's ""Brave New World""."
2,not out of choice,"I had to read the novel for an English lit course and it one of the poorest I have ever had the misfortune to read. I am sorry to say that I found it very slow and over written. The characters are shallow, the story line is far fetched and the nding is just downright unsatisfactory. And then, just when you think you've reached the end you discover 'Hisorical notes.' We are all aware that it is a story so why prolong our torture with 'Historical notes'? Its not real and the notes are irrelevant. Not only that, they pose the question of how Offred was able to record them. No-where in the novel does she relay any such detail as her difficulty in keeping records. And finally, my last moan, why are the notes at the end? They would provide a good basis and outline of the novel. They belong at the front. Though to be perfectly honest the whole thing belongs in the bin. Never agin should a student be subjected to such rubbish."
4,it's good,"it's a good book. it's not the best but it's good. i love the author's style and creativity, and the silly way she presents what possibly happened to Offred and Nick and the Commander."
2,Thinly-veiled Lefty Rant,"Thinly-veiled left rant disguised as Orwellian thriller. Well-written and a good read overall, but one wonders why a writer of Atwood's obvious gifts could not have been a little more subtle and less pedantic."
2,Interesting but...,"It was very well written, with imagery so vivid that it was at times disturbing. However, the ending ruined the entire book for me. I had never read anything by Atwood before, and I never will again. What a letdown!"
5,I like a book that makes me think,A beautifully written book that requires the reader to think. Atwood's book has a well deserved place in classic fiction. I loved it!
3,A story without a story,"If you are looking for a fascinating plot, The Handmaid's Tale might not be for you. In re-creating her dystopic, monotonous world, the typical event structure of novels is sacrificed. The setting and characters, however, are incredibly well-thought-out and detailed. From clothing to titles to shopping methods to coming-of-age ceremonies, Atwood has left nothing out. There is no real beginning, and no real ending either--just a slow march of pages (indeed, there are at least three chapters entitled ""Night"") that still keep you enraptured and horrified.While a fascinating book, The Handmaid's Tale is an exercise in imagination and thus might not be for everyone. However, if you have an interest in women's issues, this book is almost required reading."
2,not for me.,"Bought this based off reviews and I think it was on sale for .99. This book wasn't really awful but just boring. I read the entire book looking forward to my ""other"" book waiting for me. Sadly this was not for me."
4,Engaging,"An engaging fictional read, will make you reflect on your own faith (in religion or humanity). I would recommend this book to my friends."
4,If Orwell was a woman,"A very frightening alternative reality stressing the utter fragility of our country. Not too far fetched if the religious fanatics that we all know exist in this country get organized and take action. Just think of it, a return to the dark ages in terms of ideology but with nuclear weapons. Very dark, very frightening, impossible to put down. A brilliant piece of work."
5,interesting from begining to end,"I enjoyed this book from the very begining. Judging by the title, I thought it was going to be a typical school book. I thought it was going to be boring and lifeless. Trust me, it wasn't. I probably never would have read this book if it hadn't been for my Modern Novel class. I had never even heard of Margaret Atwood before this book. Because of The Handmaid's Tale I want to read more of Margaret's work."
5,GREAT BOOK!!,"Ijust finished reading this book, and it's increadible!!!! I LOVED IT!!!! I've told everyone I've talked to to read it. It takes me away from this world and places me into the world of Offred and the other characters. There were a lot of unanswered questions, but that is part of what made the book so good! I read Orwell's 1984 and there were definate parallelisms, but the situations were so different that it was hard to compare the two. As soon as you read this book, it will be one of the top books in your collection.. it's defiantely one of my top five!!!!!!!!"
4,Reality check,"The Handmaid's Tale is a very eye opening book. It makes you think about how despensible your own rights can be. I think that it was very interesting how Margaret Atwood had taken the events that were in her book from things that have actually happened in the past. It was weird to hear that these sorts of things could be heppening in the world. I mean, could you imagine going to work one day and being fired because it was the law? I would be crushed. My job is my freedom. Without it I would be totally dependent on my parents, being as I am a 17 year old high school student. Margaret Atwood takes a book about a women sitting in her room and being locked up in a small area and turns it into a very compeling and interesting book. I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to anyone that believed in their own rights along with the rights of every human being."
4,Distressing...,"This story is extraordinary...chilling, but extraordinary. As with all of her books, Atwood as a canny ability to insert the very basics of human nature into the most outrageous and horrifying of environments, which is essentially what makes this book believable. I challenge any reader to keep the chills at bay when they come to the part of the story where it is explained how the United States is overtaken by a group of religious fanatics and the world as we know it is mutated to a dystopian hell."
2,The Handmaid's Tale - Ugh!,"I was disappointed with the style of Atwood's writing. It felt as though she was trying to find the biggest and most obscure words to describe the environment. I am not the strongest reader, but love to read. I found this book to be one that I had to force myself to finish."
1,it's a different version!,"I was buying this book for class but it turned out to be a different version, without the crucial additional introduction - it's really disappointing."
5,Excellent Read,"I thought about giving it 4 stars, because I needed to know what happened at the end and I felt a bit sad the book only speculated. But, this is a great Dystopian book, before the genre really became popular."
2,A strange tale,"This was a puzzling, somewhat frightening story. I didn't enjoy reading it, but I had to see what happened in the end. Quite well written, but I got annoyed with all the descriptions--just tell the story!"
3,No Real Ending,"An interesting book to read, but there wasn't enough forward action and there was no real ending. It could have easily been the first in a series."
5,The things that stick with you...,"I didn't know what to expect when I decided to read this book, but I'd heard it wasan excellent read, so I decided to give it a try. And am I glad I did!This is one of those books that stays with you forever!A few memorable items about the book:1) The constant references to the way a situation can forcea person to forget everything they ever were or believed. It's aninteresting study into the methods of mental adaptation in the humanspecies.2) The way it's set up like an ancient oral tale that is eventually studied,picked apart, and made fun of in a long distant future. That chillingacademic response to a woman's experiences is hard to forget.This is a must read!Adora"
2,Yawn,"This novel might have made a decent short story of about 50-60 pages. After you've read that far you've gotten all there is to be gleaned from it and it's a struggle to proceed further. Yes, we get it Margaret Atwood, you find religious extremism scary. And well you should, when we've seen what the Taliban and Islamic fundamentalists have done to women and gays all over the world. Had your story been more mythical, as opposed to a poorly veiled attack on Christian fundamentalists (and I am not one so I have no particular dog in this fight) it could have been intriguing. Instead we have a dull and misguided polemic about how backward and misogynistic Christian evangelicals are."
3,The Handmaid's Tale,"Purest piece of crap written, hopefully as a WARNING. A great read to warn people against religious fanatics & sexist MEN."
2,"If you like to be left hanging at the end, read this book.","Book was very interesting and thought provoking, but exceptionally slow-moving and you really don't find out most of the stuff that seems important in the story that the main character talks about. I had thought that there was more to the book (because there was a historical overview at the end that I thought was ""more book"") and when I got to the last page, I was stunned at how little they told. I'm a ""conflict to happy ending"" type of book reader and this was DEFINITELY not the book for me. But it was somewhat enlightening."
4,I really enjoyed this book overall because it made me think.,I'm not sure if anything like this Republic of Gilead could ever happen but it makes me grateful for the world we live in now and how I take for granted all the freedom I enjoy. Atwood really knew what to write to make people want to read more about this strange society these people put up with. There are so many questions I had but that was part of the mystery of this world and it actually made me imagine what was happening if Atwood didn't directly tell us. I enjoyed this book alot and am very glad I read it.
4,Don't take freedom for granted.,"Atwood tells us in a very loud voice that a situation like Gilead is more probable then we think. As Offred leads a life of constant boundaries, even down to what they can feel. She makes you respect her strength,and you see Offred's light from within that keeps her alive. Offred shows us all of the daily freedoms that we take for granted, that in some countries in this day and age are deadly sins. Read it and I guarentee it will make you think and expand your reading horizons."
4,pet people,"Have you ever had a pet? What if you were the pet, and kept up in a cage for most of your life? This book gives us a glimps of what it might be like and what it could become if we all worked together to build a perfect world. I liked it. I found that after reading it my life didnt seem so bad and felt an added compasion for people in other countries that dont have the feedoms that we do."
5,"A Classic, Chilling, Cautionary tale!","This would have to rank as one of my all-time favorite books, and certainly one of Atwood's best. This story of a society dominated and controlled by an unfettered right-wing Christian government is absolutely terrifying. The movie does not do justice to the book, but it was a nice effort."
2,"Too cold, not thrilling, actually","A lackluster dystopian fiction, about what may happen in the future in a free country such as the US, if ruled under an authoritarian facist regime, where citizens behaviors get closely monitored and women lives are subjected to the will of the State. the story is dull, and told under a monotonous, first person monologue, that of the Handmaid. The editorial reviews promised a level of drama, mystery and intrigue, I did not experience in any chapter of this tale."
5,My favourite Margaret Atwood book,"The Handmaid's Tale was the first Atwood book I read and it remains my favourite. As I was reading the book, I was by turns fascinated and infuriated. Fascinated by the story and infuriated by the treatment of the handmaids.The Handmaid's Tale follows the main character through her new life as a handmaid to a powerful government/army man and his wife. The couple have been unable to conceive a child of their own so they have been given a handmaid, whose sole purpose is to conceive and give birth to the man's child. Through flashbacks we discover how the handmaid got to be in this situation and the life she used to have before she became this ""non-person"".Like all Atwood novels, the Handmaid's Tale contains many rich layers of meaning and symbols. It's the sort of book that I could easily read two or three times and come away with something new each time."
5,dystopian fiction at it's best,An amazing book. For anyone that loves to read dystopian literature this is a must read. Brilliantly written and capturing till the last page.
4,Personal Freedoms,"I think what Margaret Atwood's, The Handmaid's Tale is a foreshadowing to our own futures. In this novel all peronal freedoms are taken from the main character and all the remaining people. I think this is a good representation of what could happen when people stopped participating in the social/political happenings around them. Everyone must make sure that even the smallest freedoms being taken away from them must not be overlooked. We must keep our eyes open and stay active in our surroundings and decisions regarding our lives."
2,Rambling Narrator,"Told in first person, the story strayed quite often with inner thinking that appeared to ramble and was sometimes random. Flashbacks came without transitioning or warning. It was an interesting idea for a novel; the plot was just a little slow moving for my taste. Most importantly though, the ending just left me hanging, which compels me to take away one more star. =("
3,Classic dystopian novel,"In Atwood's near future, a revolution has turned the United States into Gilead, and some number of mostly unnamed things have caused the birth rate to go down significantly. As a result, powerful men get not only Wives but Marthas (cooks and housekeepers) as well as Handmaids, whose job it is to procreate on behalf of the Wives. Unsurprisingly, not everyone is happy with the new world order, and one of them has managed to write about it for posterity.This is a classic in the dystopian novel genre for good reason, along with Brave New World and 1984, which are often read in literature classes, although the fact that much of the plot revolves around the society's sexual practices make this thoughtful and thought provoking novel appropriate for a slightly older audience."
2,Be wary - abridged and has bad review,Not yet transferred to Ipod but depressed to find this is abridged - my error
4,Religion and politics gone awry,"Offred, a sexual slave, writes a memoir of her experiences in the repressive male dominated future of the United States. The US experiences a serious drop in reproductive levels due to environmental degradation, birth control, abortion, etc... As a result, a religious militant cult forces these women to be breeding vehicles and restore reproductive levels to it's former levels.What's most interesting is the perverse use of religion to justify its cruelty toward women and ironically many of the enforcers of this nightmare are also women. It's an easily read book and a dire warning to fight the current illogicality in religion in today's age"
5,Life Changing,"Everytime I read this book (and it's been about 12 or 13 times now) I take something new out of it. It will change the lives of any female or male who reads it. You'll think about it the next time you go to the ATM or use a credit card or anything. The book will haunt you in the scariest, best way...Read it. Go. Now. Don't wait."
5,one of my favorites,"This is definitely one of the best books I have ever read. I've read it multiple times and each time I find something new that I hadn't realized before. I think it is incredibly powerful and really makes you think. I had to write a school report on a dystopia and I chose to do it on this book. There is so much in this book to talk about. It's a fast read, very interesting, thoughtful, entertaining, and even a bit scary. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a great book to read."
2,Magaret Atwood -- please no more political books,"Margaret Atwood writes yet another book with more weak and obvious messages. I have read Oryx and Crake, then it was about genetic engineering, corporate power, etc. This time it's about female rights and warning women to assert them to what I can engender. Now, I can handle a book with a weak and obvious message, however, Atwood decided to use Orwell's technique of boredom but throughout the entire book. It worked and I was incredibly bored. Oryx and Crake was at least enjoyable because of it's excitement and humour. Atwood's writing style and wit is so rare and I wish she would not waste it."
1,If i could give this 0 stars i would.,First the kindle copy isn't perfect. Words are misspelled and abbreviated wrong. I'm not very picky about this and it bothered me so it's that bad.Secondly (Im not going into detail since I don't want ruin the story if you plan to read it)the story line is awful! The ending is awful. I wouldn't suggest this book to anyone. I read it after rereading the giver and that's a similar story line but this story jumps around but with no warning. It's hard to fallow and it's hard to relate to the character since she sleeps around. I'm not planning to watch the movie after the awful book.
1,Bonkers,"I had to read this book for school. I am one of those people who, when I start a book, I have to finish. Nothing bothers me more than to have to stop reading a book for an extended period of time right in the middle of it. I stoped reading this book around page 200."
1,"Depressing, boring waste of time","I never normally get around to writing reviews but this book was just so terrible I felt compelled to write something for once. Atwood seems to want to tease the reader by failing to explain any of what is going on directly, and instead wastes our time describing how things used to be, ie. the real world that we all still live in. The plot is implausible, the characters are dull and many of the events described are horrific. If you start reading nad get the urge to stop then do it - don't waste your time dragging yourself on - it doesn't get any better!"
1,A trop of Lustful characters,"I have found that people don't like to read negitive reviews, but I fear I must give one here. I did not like this book (this I am afraid is a grose understatment of my feelings towardes 'The Handmaids Tale') I read this book and was shocked and discusted by the sextual content and the vularity. The book in some way uses the characters sexual activitys and swearing as sings of rebelion. I do not think this is the best way. The plot might have been intresting to me had the characters not all been so sleezy, and lustful. they were always, it seemed, dreaming/doing sextual things. I felt like I was reading a book by an auther whos main influances were flowers for algernon and sience fiction storys, the kind you buy at shoppers drugmarte."
3,Not as good as some others say.,It was okay but it was not as good as I thought it would be. I didn't read all of the Historical Notes because I liked how the book ended without them. Leaving the ending up to the imagination was the best beacuse you could end the book however you wanted. Whether Offred found her little girl or if she was taken off somewhere to be beaten or killed. I really enjoyed this book alot and would recommend it anyone. Margaret Atwood has written a masterpiece.
5,One of the best books ever written.,"This book should be required reading for every woman in America. Period. Brilliant, haunting, genius. I've read it a million times and never tire of it. One of the modern classics."
1,Too tough to read... Had to put it away,There's too much interruption in train of thought. Overuse of punctuation. I put it in a collection I named LATER. Perhaps I'll re-visit it some day.
4,I read this book and then threw it across the room.,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was great. It was hard to put it down, especially after page 200. But the ending was irritating. It was so annoying that so much was left hanging. No real closure was given at the ending. Then after the book went barrelling across the room, I sat and analyzed the ending. It really was better that way. No real ending could have been written without ruining the book completely. Atwood's writing style is pure genious."
4,Nolite te bastardes carbonderium...,"This book leaves me speechless. Absolutely haunting, it left me dazed and slightly fearful of our present society, in which everything is controlled by computer. It took me all of a day to finish the book for a modern novel course, after which we interpreted the book through photographs. I was amazed by the things i saw that made me think 'Handmaid Moment'. Did you see that the personal notification service for amazon.com is called the Eye?"
4,This was a good book,"I really liked this book. It was creepy and it was very suspenseful. I was totally happy with the ending and I would definately recommend it to anyone. If you're a person who has problems with trust, this book will change your life. As soon as I was done reading it, I cried with joy for about an hour. It was very poetic, which maade the story so much better. It's a little hard to take in at first, but after the first 100 pages, I couldn't put it down. It was great."
5,I LOVED it!,This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. It was well written and definitely well thought-out. I did feel that Atwood left a few loose ends that may have been explained a little better.
4,The Handmaid's Tale has made me value democracy a lot!,"After reading this book, I thought that it was a warning of what could happen. I know it is hard to imagine that one day everything could start changing like it did in Offred's life, but you never know. I think this book also makes us think about how we take things for granted, like our wonderful government-democracy. This book has made we feel very good about the world we live in now. Like any human being, there have been many times that I have been very mad at our government. I realize that we are free, though, and our everyday actions are not controlled and restricted like they are in the Republic of Gilead."
5,Thankfully it's only words,"Words are items that can effect us individually in many different ways. I say thankfully it's just words because one can learn a great deal from reading Atwood's text. Offred is in limbo and realistic to anyone who reads the story. What's scary is the fact that the scenes in the book are far too real and transport the reader to a place they can easily escape from, unlike Offred. Thankfully the book is composed of words that we can learn from. This is a book you'll want to put down in horror and pick up the very next second in intrigue. A must in any library or future generations."
5,"Interesting story, something different","Some of the other reviewers complained that it was boring listening to the main character's thought processes. I disagree. The whole point was to show the tedium that she endured. Yes, it is ""another dystopia story"" but it is a truly unique one. I enjoy the peeling away of the perfection of the society. Especially like the section at the end where the experts of the future are debating the authenticity of the text, but I think it would have been better to have that as an introduction. I definitely recommend this one."
4,Great Book,"I thought it was a good read. I still can't decide it was enjoyable or not. I found myself unable to put it down, and read it in one sitting, but the ending left me wanting some relief from the situation Offred was in. I definitely had some emotional responses to the story. It was frustrating what the government was doing to the rights of women, backpedaling on hundreds of years of work seemingly within moments. Also, I was waiting for an answer for the tough circumstances Offred was in, and there seemed to be no end to her suffering. Overall, I think the ending was left unwritten so that the reader could decide Offred's fate. I would like to think she ended up with some semblance of her old life back."
3,One Reason To Buy This CD,"The only reason to purchase this CD is for the nearly 17 minute version of ""Love To Love You Baby"". Yup, it reaks of mid-seventies disco, but isn't that the point? It was the first of it's kind and somewhat of a collector's item. The other five songs seem like dated fillers, but the title track is great music, produced at a time when dicso could be listened to as well as danced to. A real band with no synthesizers! Great memories!"
5,BEST OF DISCO/SOUL,A GREAT INNOVATIVE ALBUM BY ONE OF THE FEW TRUE DISCO ERA STARS.JUST WORTH IT FOR THE 16 MIN TITLE TRACKGREAT SERVICE OF PRODUCT AGAIN.THE BEST PLACE TO BUY CDS
1,"wow, thanks for not selling us the 16 minute song!",It's amazing that the extended play version of the song is not for sale. Looks like I won't be buying this!
4,Great U.S. Debut,"""Love to love you baby,"" the album's title track is what actually launched the short-lived disco era. The song is 16 minutes and 48 seconds long, but it's known as being the ""17 minute version."" It's filled with orgasmic yelps that hypnotically puts your body into a trance until the next song, ""Full of Emptiness"" begins. I gave the album 4 stars instead of 5 because there are only 6 songs, however, each of those 6 songs are special in their own right. When you hear ""Full of Emptiness,"" ""Need-A-Man Blues,"" ""Whispering Waves,"" Pandora's Box,"" and ""Full of Emptiness (Reprise)"" you'll notice why Donna hasn't faded along with her fellow singers of the disco era; her voice and connections with her songs tell you she has the ability to stay for as long as she wants. These songs are a collection that would make any artist proud to have on their debut album; they truly are remarkable."
2,"It has historical value, but...","this really is not Donna's best work. I can see why she cringes when she hears this now. While I dig the title track (hell, who doesen't?), this album is not very strong overall. You can tell Donna and her producers were still tweaking her sound (which would materialize on ""A Love Trilogy"" the following year) and trying to establish her as an artist. But ""Need A Man Bules"" is just unlistenable, while ""Full of Emptiness"" and ""Whispering Waves"" are just average. Her voice is high and lovely, but you can tell she holding back. I really liked ""Pandora's Box"" because you get to hear Donna flex those pipes the way she does on her later work. Since this is the album that really got the disco ball spinning, it is worth having in your collection, but as an album it is just average. For a better picture of Donna, check out ""Four Seasons of Love,"" ""Live & More"" or ""Bad Girls,"" among others."
3,Donna's Disco Debut,"For her second album, Donna & producer Georgio Moroder decided to jump on the bandwagon of what would later become Disco music, and honesty, nobody did it better than Donna. This is the album which launched her career here in the States (her first LP, 'Lady Of The Night' was never released here), but is not her best offering by far. The title song, showcased here in it's full-length 16+ version has earned it's place as the epitome of the Disco classic, unfortunately it outshines the rest of the album. Thia, now, is the only way to get the full length ""Love To Love You Baby"", but if you're looking for a good Donna Summer album, well, this isn't it."
5,THIS IS DONNA BEFORE COMMERCIALISM,"FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD LIKE TO CORRECT ANOTHER REVIEWER ABOUT ONE OF THE SONGS ON THE ALBUM. SEEMS HE DIDN'T LISTEN TO, OR UNDERSTAND THE LYRICS TO WHISPERING WAVES. IT IS NOT ABOUT HER IMAGINING THINGS ON THE BEACH, ITS ABOUT HER LONGING FOR A LOVER WHO ABANDONED HER SUDDENLY, WITH NO WARNING.WHEN THIS ALBUM WAS RELEASED, I WAS 16, AND AMAZED TO FIND THAT THE WHOLE ALBUM STOOD UP, NOT JUST THE TITLE CUT. GEORGIO MORODER USED TO PRODUCE MANY SONGS FOR DONNA, AND FOR DISCO EVEN, SOME OF THE MOVEMENTS WERE QUITE INTRICATE. SADLY, FOR ME AT LEAST, DONNA NEVER MATCHED THE INTENSITY, ARTISTRY AND DELIVERY FEATURED IN THIS DEBUT VINYL. SHE MADE A COUPLE MORE ""O-K"" SONGS, BUT THIS RELEASE IS THE FLAGSHIP. TAKE IT FROM A GUY WHO HAS BUMPED, BOOGIED, AND STEPPED TO THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM IN CHICAGOLAND WITH HIS WIFE OF 25 YEARS, SINCE WE WERE TEENAGERS WHEN IT WAS RELEASED. NUFF SAID."
1,Bristles fall loose - all the time,"Worst pastry brushes I've ever bought. I bought three and have used all of them more than once, so it isn't first time blues. This is just shoddy quality.When using for a marinade or to spread melted butter on a cake tin, all of the brushes consistently loose bristles. In the last cake I made I found five bristle fibers stuck to the bottom of the cake.The bristles have a rough consistency and after a couple of washes fray easily. I can't see you using this for any delicate work.I would compare the texture to the splinters that fall off wooden skewers.Spend the extra mullah and buy a better product."
3,Smelly,"This brush smelled when I received it. The bristles are natural, maybe that's why. I washed it in the dishwasher and it still smelled when it was wet but got better when it dried."
3,"Ok, but not perfect","Somehow I thought that this brush would be a bit larger than it is. Can not use it for what I had thought, but works well in tight areas"
4,An easy introduction to Biblical Hebrew,"Like the author's book on New Testament Greek, this book is pretty easy to get into. The CD is fun to listen to. I especially like the voice of the woman who does some of the narration. I feel, however, that some of the diphthongs should have been explained in more detail."
2,La Mer,OK way to try product with low $ price. Would not buy regular size. Use the La Mer cream all the time but this concentrate is not worth the $$$.
3,very nice maps,"I bought this book to go along with a History of Islam course at my college, and though this book does not go into the historical details of Islam, and its treatment of it at times is simple, its maps allow me to follow along with the narrative in my class with an illuminated vision of where the action is taking place, in additon to other books, The Historical Atlas of the Islamic World has really helped me to understand my material better."
5,Love Note,"This is a good movie for to view. It was not a typical tear jerker movie. However, it will touch you deeply as you see this young man who gets to know this new girl in his school little by little. He has good intentions and always asks help from God. He deeply wants to understand what is troubling her and show her that God can help. He doesn't know why see is so bitter and tries to show her that life is not so hopeless. She finds the love of God and believes in his eternal love. This story makes you feel emotinal and you feel that you are not alone and that God loves us and gave his life for us. You will like this movie."
4,a post-modern classic with heart,"tense, absorbing, a miracle! this shows that the love shared by 2 teenagers and their creator does not have to deteriorate into just another love triangle tale. my only quibble: they obviously sped up Craig's spinning backfist in the climatic fight to make him seem more formidable"
3,A Chameleon's Life,"Marvell's is not an easy life to write. His remarkable caution in a remarkable time led to a dearth of biographical source material. Murray, at times, seems to have limited sympathy for Marvell, and the thinness of his source material sometimes gives the impression of 'slightness' to his treatment. But in the last third of the book, I got a glimpse of a Marvell I'd never seen anywhere else - tough, fearless and at risk in ways we can't imagine. I give the book THREE STARS, but relative to other available biographies on Marvell, it probably deserves FOUR. If you're interested in Marvell, it's well worth reading."
5,great,used this to weld a mild steel flange to a cast iron manfiold. I hammered and sanded of all the flux coating and used it with a tig welder. Worked great!
5,The Bible (Cliffs Notes),"the book was in really good condition - and less expensive than buying the old and new testaments separately. also, it's a very interesting read - more 'the bible as history.' it in no way seeks to interpret the bible or be a substitute for it."
4,Works fine so far,"So far everything has worked fine. The only bad thing is that the power block feels really cheap. I've read other reviews that have said that the power blocks have failed, and that doesn't surprise me. Hopefully if I take good care of it I won't have any problems."
3,It works,"The unit works, but it feels very cheap. Feels like it's a generic rip-off of someone's product, the power felt hard to push in and the SATA cable doesn't have a tight fit. The images displayed are not the actual product. I would rather spend the money on something that has a better quality. Overall, it works but I would not buy this product again."
4,Took a Little Effort...,"It took some effort, but I managed to get it to work. This kind of device appears to be meant for people of medium+ computer knowledge. One downside is that if you're using it to access old EIDE drives, like I did, you need to reboot your computer for every individual drive you access.Pros: It works, enabling you to access old drives without having to open your pc case.Cons: Not for everyone, requires a little know-how in order to work, and requires a lot of reboots to access multiple drives.Overall: Albeit it takes time and effort, it does work, so I'm going to give it 4 stars."
1,Product I received doesn't match the picture,"The product I recieved looks nothing like this picture, mine had no led lights letting u know it was working, and sata drive plug goes I'n the top. Just by looking at the product I received U can tell it is very cheap, I used it once, worked fine now for It to work you have to push the IDE contact on an angle, it's obvious the contacts opened up already after one use."
1,Support Company out of business,Really think the product would have been what I was looking for except it did not include drivers and when I tried to contact the supplier they had gone out of business
3,Works OK with XP,I bought this item for data recovery from a HDD to PC via USB. I now have Vista and Windows 7 and it doesn't work with those Operating Systems.
4,Does the job,"It's not a terribly pretty product but this little kit certainly does what is advertised. I used it on two separate SATA drives and one IDE drive. There were a ton of cables to contend with, which made the whole thing pretty messy but when all was said and done, the cables worked as promised. For the price, this was a great product."
4,Simply put...,Allows you to pull a hard drive from a computer and then access it with a USB connection.
5,Worth the price,"I find this type of adapter very useful. The very first unit like this I bought was this brand, I later bought a couple of cheaper models from a different company. The cheaper models work fine for shorter periods but if doing anything that requires more than a few minutes the cheaper models transformers overheat and the units quit responding. The Cables Unlimited model holds up without overheating, its about twice the price but certainly worth the extra cost."
4,"Good, but expensive.","This product was very easy to set-up. I plugged it in, connected it to USB, and powered it up. Instantly Windows 7 recognized it as a USB device and I had full access to my hard drive.I think the only con to this product is the price point. For $20+, I could have just purchased a IDE/SATA -> USB Docking station. That way I could have had a drive enclosure with it for around the same price."
1,Beware of who you order this through...,"I ordered this from a company called HDE. They did not send me the Cables Unlimited product, instead they sent me a generic product that they advertise for less than half the cost of this item.My review is rated solely on the company HDE sending the wrong product."
2,Fried My SATA Laptop Hard Drive,"I was able to use this perfectly with some old IDE drives.But I lost all my wife's iTunes music and personal data connecting this contraption to her old 250GB SATA HD after installing Windows 7 on a newer HD. It basically fried the board so it was no longer responsive (platter doesn't spin) - even when installing it back into the laptop it used to live in. I bet the data is still there, but I'd have to pay a recovery service big money to get the data off the platter. So because I paid for the cheaper version of this, I now have an unhappy wife.Buying this device falls into that category of ""penny wise and pound foolish."" Go higher end and don't risk the damage of SATA equipment because of a low-end SATA power connection. I no longer trust this thing - it's going in the trash."
5,Works Great,"I needed this cable to rescue data off of 2 old IDE drives after the old HP 510 died and this item did the trick. Set the jumpers to slave on the drives, plugged it into the new W7 machine and it worked straight away. Copied all the old data and iTunes libraries over to the new machine without a single hiccup. The documentation was included (I didn't need it in the event, but it is included).a great item at a great price!"
3,"Good quality, missing power switch!","A good quality product, however it has one MAJOR flaw.There is on power switch on the power adapter!!! Unplugging the power adapter is not an ideal way to turn the hard drive on and off.I ended up returning this unit and getting one from Rosewill instead.Aside from this issue, the rest of the unit is good quality and works fine."
4,Excellent product,It is simple to use. I used it for all my sata drives.It is a must have for guys who want to fix hard disk issues
1,Cheap Junk,"Be warned Cellular Factory intentionally put up the wrong pictures on this listing. This is the cheapo adapter with no activity lights. You might as well buy it elsewhere for half this price. Cheap, cheap, cheap. False Advertising."
4,Data Saver,Had a hard drive crash and the computer wouldn't recognize it as a hard drive. Plugged this guy in and retrieved all my data. Good buy. Worth every dime.
3,"cheaply made, but works","i used it on both connectors and with both of the power supply adapters and after jiggling them around got em to work. nice. did what it was supposed to. unfortunately the thing took for ever to get here. i mean, it took almost a month from when i ordered till i got it, super lame seller, but a good, if not cheaply made product."
1,Worked fine but power supply,When I first purchased this I thought It didn't work. I plugged it into the hard drive and connected the power cord and nothing. I forgot about it till I needed something off a hard drive and figured I'd try plugging it into a spare plug in my computer for power and use it just for the SATA to USB that did work. Why the power supply that come with would not work I do not know and for less than $20 I am not to bothered to bug the seller.
3,Not perfect,"The SATA power converter interface on these is very cheap. It is hard to get a good connection and it comes out easily. I had to tape mine to get a good connection to stay. It is also angled at 90 degrees for no apparent reason. It wouldn't be such a big deal, except it is angled in the wrong direction to use it so you have to bend it (which stresses the already cheap connection).Aside from the cheap connection for SATA power, it works as described. I would, however, pay more for something that wasn't such a pain."
5,Marc Anthony has the most beautiful voice!,"I love to hear him in English or Spanish... if you love to hear perfection in song, you MUST get this CD- and all others by Marc Anthony! He is just beyond incredible! And this is a light-hearted, sweet love song... it's great! GET IT!"
5,Anubis Statue,Great quality statue. I ordered 2 of them to sit on both sides of my LCD TV. Both were identical and packaged in a Styrofoam box. Also received same week as ordered.
4,Tombstone; an Iliad of the Southwest,"Great old book. Very informative and presents details, events and names of people that modern writers have overlooked or choose not to include in there condenced versions of the events that took place in Tombstone. Burns does invent a few details but if you have a good working knowledge of the Earp boys and Tombstone you will have no trouble spoting these few inacurate statements. I think everyone who is interested in the Tombstone legend should read this book!"
2,very Iffy,Not up to snuff as a clam knife. It's too thick to prise open a shell. It might work on oysters but not clamsI bought this via Amazom prime
1,terrible,too thick to actually be able to get in between the shells to pry open. Maybe I'm doing something wrong (but have been doing fine with other knives. The oyster shucker on the other hand is excellent!
3,clam knife,I'VE USED THE CLAM KNIFE TWICE. I WASN'T ABLE TO OPEN ALL OF MY CLAMS. I WISH THE END WAS A LITTLE THINNER.
2,Not As Advertise!,"I purchase this ""CLAM KNIFE"" in 2010, after doing a little more research on how to open clams, I now realize that this is not the proper item to use. This Knife is actually a ""OYSTER"" knife. I was ever able to open a clam from the from the front unless it was slightly open. I eventually figure out how to it using this knife, and that is by sticking the tip of this knife into the back of the clam where it's soft & rubbery then work the knife around to the front of the clam. Most times I'll end up breaking the shell, but a less it's opened."
4,Fine product,The phone charger works great. I am pleased with the item. The only thing that would have made it better is is the electrical plug folded making the item easier to transport during travel.
2,A flaunting Bitch!,Not my cup of tea! Just a typical young flaunting European female traveler. I met one over there once that was kinda typical of this one. I got away clean however and never looked back. I should have known better than to get involved with a pick up. Ha! Yuk! BB
4,It's nearing the end...,"Those who've bought the one's before know what they're buying now. For the newbies out there curious, buy the first one. First."
4,NOT THAT BAD,4 STARS because most of the fun declined after the take over .But there is still action/adventure there still of course.It is still well done & creative as before.But what i do not like is the wars.But the theme of creating peace is what i like a lot.
5,Great brush!,"It seems silly to review a scrub brush, but this is just an excellent tool. I've used it to scrub my shower and it takes grime and mildew right out from the tile crevices and I've scrubbed a few other things with it. So far, it has done everything I've asked of it, working with little effort compared to other things I've used to scrub, and it still looks almost new. I""m getting ready to order two more for our home."
5,Not your average scrubber,"I sort of can't believe I'm leaving a review for a scrub brush, but this is truly a much MUCH better product than the ones I'd been using before. Previously I'd thought that any brush would do, and just nabbed one at the CVS or Walgreens. But this brush has made me realize that cleaning could have been easier.I use this to scrub my bathroom sinks, primarily (with a handy mix of baking soda and cinnamon), and it doesn't scratch them at all. It also seems to glide over surfaces more effectively, while also giving them a thorough cleaning.Am definitely getting a second one of these for my kitchen sink."
5,Great product,"Seller was efficient and product is excellent, seems like industrial strength...not one of the kitchen brushes I bought in the past from the local Target that wore out quickly."
5,It did a good job as we expected,No quality problem with this product. It is cheap but meet every need you want with this brush. I use them for cleanning hard surface. It really works very well. The brush is either not too hard or too soft. And the design is perfect for its function. I would recommend this item to other people looking for brush.
5,LEEEEEEEES BACK!,"IT IS SO COOL THAT LEE HAS HAD 2 RECENT NEW CD'S OUT.WOUNDED HEART WAS GREAT AND SAME RIVER, DIFFERENT BRIDGE REALLY SHOWS HOW LEE'S VOICE IS LIKE A FINE WINE, IT GETS BETTER WITH AGE. KEEP SINGING TO US LEE.WE LUV YA!"
4,Noiseland,"Before touching heaven with their ""Loveless"", MBV made this excellent record. New ideas, noisy sounds and an own style make this record to sound still original (after 11 years), sure it is not as elaborated as ""Loveless"" is, but which one it is!. MBV are (or were) the most audacious explorers of noise."
4,Lucky Accident,"I bought this out of a cut rack for $3.99. It sat in my CD tower for at least 5 years before I ever really listened to it.I couldn't stand the way it sounded over my stereo and I came close to trading it.I brought it to work and put my headphones on and it sounds like a completely different album.I really like the whole experience. I'm lucky I brought it up here-it was going nowhere at home but I'm playing it a couple of times a day over my headphones. I don't know anything about this band,I bought it on a whim,but I'd reccommend this album and I may follow up on this band."
3,For MBV fans only.,"A good album, but easily destroyed by their masterpiece, Loveless. While there's some noteworthy tracks (All I Need sounds like a framework for Loveless), the uneven production hinders an otherwise decent album.Of all the albums of their still in print, Isn't Anything is probably the least essential of them all."
2,Not for average Joe/Jane!,"So I love ""Loveless"" and so decided to add some more MBV to my collection. And seeing that this album got the same ratings as ""Loveless"" I went for it - sadly, without listening to the preview clips. Alas, I found this album to be, frankly, an absolute MESS! None of the semi-melodious, invitingly-droning, enveloping, soundscapeness that makes me fond of ""Loveless"". Very hard to listen to, not very approachable for an average music appreciator. My face was kinda scrunched up in confusion as I tried my best to listen to every track but ended up skip forward through them all within a mere 20 minutes and started wondering how much I'm gonna get for it at the used CD store. Yikes. I ended up getting cold feet on the other 2 MBV cd's I ordered along with it and they currently await the postman to take them back to Amazon unopened for a refund."
1,"Pretentious,self-involved,artlessly atonal swill.","This is college mope-rock at its absolute worst. Having enjoyed 'Loveless', I was shocked to hear how dry the production is. This is not kind to ANY element of MBV, and shows why Shields dialed up the guitar and swept everything else under the rug on 'Loveless'. An act of sheer necessity. From the milk-carton snare to the absurdly morose vocals of Shields and Butcher, to the droning, insipidly downbeat drivel of the songs themselves, this is bad, bad stuff here, folks. If this was MBV's last record, only the most defiantly non-conformist indie poseur would like this or make the effort to convince themselves they did."
4,A very under-rated album,"I like the album more than loveless. Don't get my wrong, loveless is great, but it is very calculated and every song shares the same sort of sound with the dense layers and the voice turned down. Isn't Anything is pure shoegaze. This album rocks with funky songs like soft as snow and seven girls galore, to the bleak ""sueisfine"" and ""you never should"", this is a really great album worthy of its follow-up and worth a listen."
4,my bloody valentine Is Something,"You know, it's kind of ironic, my experience with this group. I thought of 'em as a real head-scratcher band when I heard ""Loveless"" a couple years ago, one of the first times I realized that ""indie"" music wouldn't come to me as easily as I had initially thought. However, there was a romantic overtone and nice tunes that fascinated me at the same time and while I don't think it's 5-star good, this album sort of warmed me up to it.It's a pretty solid album throughout. It's not the overproduced experiment of ""Loveless,"" but rather, more them making pop songs in the vein of Jesus and Mary Chain. They still have their own identity though. Feedback rules over ""All I Need."" My favorite two songs are ""Soft as Snow (But Warm Inside)"" and ""No More Sorry,"" which showed that they had genious in them before their highly praised swan song. I wish I enjoyed the second half as much as the first, but it's alright."
5,Dementia 13,"Coppola and Corman...what could be better than this. Also, you will notice that certain aspects (e.g. the eerie music and the say that we have a kid mudering his sister) of John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN seemed to have been copied from this Coppola film."
2,A slasher with gusto,"Can you believe this movie is Francis Ford Coppola, and produced by Roger Corman? Nether can the viewer. I am not sure how it made it to film. However it has collector value.Dementia 13 is not a bad movie; it is a little dark in more ways than one. The just is nothing significant about it other than a few hacker scenes.We find our self in a Castle with a murderer who is bumping every one off. The question is ""who done it?""Was it Lizzie Borden or Jeffery Dalmer?Maybe it was mommy?Or the mad doctor?Who knows?This movie makes a good addition to slasher movies and it is not as mindless as most.Apocalypse Now - The Complete Dossier (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)"
5,Damned becomes palatable,"This is a pop album by a punk band, retaining the energy of their previous releases while adding hooks and harmonies. It even has dynamics, with the mellowness of ""Under the Floor Again"" to the rapidity of ""Ignite"". A must buy."
3,It's a mediocre rock album,"If you came looking for punk, this album is NOT for you. If you want a band that was musically broadening their horizons through experimentation, then get this album. When I got this album I was expecting a rocking punk LP, but I was disappointed. Strawberries marks the point where The Damned decided to leave the punk scene in favor of Goth/New Order. Some call them sell-outs for it and in a strictly punk sense they are. But the music is solid. No one can ever say that The Damned made bad music.I'm not partial to this genre and would've liked to hear another album like Machine Gun Etiquette."
3,pretty good,"This record does not live up to the hype. A bit too ambitious, it falls flat. A few catchy hooks and interesting arrangements save it from oblivion."
2,Fairly lame,"Hey, I'm as much a Laymon fan as the next guy, and I don't pick up his books expecting Tolstoy or anything, but I thought this one was pretty limp. The violence is so overbearing it comes off as cartoonish (not even fun cartoonish, just yawn-inducing), and the characters are as 2-dimensional as they can be in a story like this. Want some fun Laymon? Pick up ""Ths Stake"" or ""Island""."
4,"A thrilling, quick and satisfying read","Richard Laymon has a knack for basing an entire story in a short amount of time. The last book I read by him, Among The Missing, also occurred in a single evening. And Laymon makes it all seem so easy and natural, or unnatural as the case may be.This is another excellent book in that vein. This time a mysterious black rain falls on a town and everyone who is struck by it turns into a enraged killer. As is also normal, a wide number of characters are all involved in the story and each and every one of them seems real. And that tops off what you would expect from a horror novel: a good story, excellent characters and a fast paced read. Definitely a recommendation!"
3,Not bad. Different.,"This is my first Laymon novel and it probably won't be my last. It wasn't as rich and textured as a good Koontz novel, and the ending wasn't as developed as I'd hoped (and grown used to), but overall I enjoyed it. If gore turns you off, you might think ORN is excessively violent for violence's sake--lots of blood, very graphic descriptions, some cannibalism--but given the plot it seemed to fit. ORN was a fast read with enough oomph to pull me along to the end. Not a fantastic book when compared to Koontz, King, Wilson or McCammon but definitely worthwhile for horror fans."
2,"TRUST ME, HE HAS WRITTEN MUCH BETTER","Sorry, as a longtime fan, this 1991 reprint lacks the subtle yet brutal depth of his later works: Check out Savage, Bite, to name a few. Yes its titallating, gross and violent, but seems more cartoonsih than his later works...C'mon Leisure Books, release Body Rides and other 90's novels.."
4,Superb,"Superb, sick, perverse, gory, and detailed. All of the ingredients for a Laymon classic. 100% unbridled gore from beginning to end. A fantastic, and compelling read"
2,DISAPPOINTED!,"This book really did nothing for me. It was the first of Laymon's books I read and probably the last. I don't mind far-fetched story ideas, in fact I love Stephen King, but this was borderline ridiculous! Halfway through the book I couldn't wait for it to end, not because I really wanted to know what was going to happen, but because I felt I was wasting valuable time living! After reading it, I thought Laymon might be a new author still trying to find his style, but then I caught a glimpse of his picture and bio on the inside back cover and - oh my! If you're looking for some classic horror, I'd suggest Stephen King's PET SEMATARY, Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND, or some newer authors like J.G. Passarella's WITHER and Ronald Damien Malfi's THE SPACE BETWEEN (more sci-fi, still a good book). Whatever you choose, I would not recommend this book!"
2,blah!,"this book wasn't all that great. and, that's being nice. i love horror, and it had mediocre reviews on here, so i thought i'd check it out. i was disappointed. it does have some good points. i enjoyed the sections with the young babysitter and the little girl she was watching. but, the rest just sorta sucked. the rape scene wasnt frightening. it was ignorant. and, it isnt all that gory of a novel. as for the political point, we get it. that factor is too simple, too cliched, and too trite to mention. also, the trying to overcome the racism aspect of the book makes the book racist in itself. as simple as it is to read, im having a hard time getting through to the end. and, the other reviewer on here was right, he uses the word ""rump"" about 117 times in the novel. buy another book, instead. or, do what i did, check it out at the library."
2,My Least Favorite Laymon So Far,"I always try to keep my reviews short and sweet. Laymon is definitely not for everyone. LAymon always lived in his own world where common human psychology does not apply to his characters. (Example: a girl gets raped and an hour later she is ready to get it on with another character; or someone's boyfriend gets killed and later she is off having fun.) However, Laymon is usually an easy read that does not go very in-depth. This book was not as enjoyable as other books I have read by him. It was rather boring and very preposterous with too simple of an ending - even for Laymon. My recommendation: start with something different by Laymon."
1,So bad I couldn't even finish it!,"This book was bad. Plain and simple. I've only read two of Laymon's other books, The Traveling Vampire Show and Among the Missing, and this book pales in comparison with those two. I got about 1/3 of the way through the book, and I totally lost interest and stopped reading. Even if you are a Laymon fan do yourself a favor and skip this one."
2,Fast-paced but unfulfilling.,"The plot of ONE RAINY NIGHT can be summed up easily: black rain falls, turns people into killers, and the unaffected few must try to stay alive. That's it.Granted this is my first Laymon novel, and I already have BITE so I will give that a chance, but if this lowest-common-denominator material is the sort of horror people are raving about, I feel sad for the future of the genre. This is b-movie stuff, and fit only for a short story or novella, if that. Like Bentley Little's UNIVERSITY, the author simply uses a device (in this case, the rain) as a vehicle for sex and violence, but there's even less to this particular story.ONE RAINY NIGHT is easy to breeze through, and if you're looking for something to read on the train or on the beach it may be perfect. I thought it was a disappointment."
3,One Rainy Night- Richard Laymon,"I love Mr. Laymon's novels. This one was great nasty fun until near the end when it came to an abrupt, what-the-hell-happened climax. He has the occasional habit of just leaving his characters dangling. And I don't much care for his referring to women as ""gals"" all the time. I'm not a stickler for PC terminology, but that just rubs me the wrong way... However, this novel is most certainly worth reading."
2,Very Contrived,"As an avid reader of horror fiction, I looked forward to reading this author's material for the first time. I was quite disappointed.Yes, it is a page-turner, but a very shallow page turner. I found myself skimming as I hit the middle of it...and once I begin skimming, that's the death of a novel to me.The characters have absolutely no depth. Their various motivations make little sense. Why would a police detective run an obstacle course of insane murderers to find a woman he knew only a few days...risking the lives of people under his protection? Why were three teenaged boys so bad to the bone? So many more inconsistencies and unexplored questions.I seriously doubt I'll pick up another of his books."
4,Don't Read It On A Dark & Stormy Night....,"This was a fun (but rather silly) gory adventure. It was a suspenseful read and certainly grisly with its violence, but definitely entertaining. The main vein of the plot - a black rain falls from the sky, transforming those who get wet - was certainly unique, and the opening scene was downright shocking. The explanation of the rain was not the high point in the book, but it didn't detract from the fun of this horrific read."
3,Not worth the premium price.,"The Oxo Good Grips handle is wasted on this duster since you will not be gripping a duster hard enough to get any benefit from the handle design. Go with Oxo when buying knives, peelers and paint brushes. For a feather duster, you might as well get something cheaper.Also, the photo makes this duster look larger than it is. The duster is only about a foot long and more than half of that is the handle. This is a good duster for shelves cluttered with knick-knacks, but for larger areas (blinds, top of the fridge, cabinets) you'll want a much bigger duster."
1,Cheap but worthless,"I bought this hoping to get a few dictinctive, recognizeable licks under my belt quickly. I was greatly disappointed. The snippets are mainly tiny, especially for the better songs -- several are so short you do not even get a feel for the song. Others do not seem authentic and vary from other tab/music scores I have seen (Sunshine of Your Love for example varies from two other versions that I own and is inferior to both). For Layla I don't think they chose the best guitar part (the original has at least 4 guitars). My girl is just one measure/barr!! Save your money, there are better books and magazines than this one."
3,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!,"Great horrific movie that has something to do with AHHHHHH sreaming. Movie about a group of teenagers that are being terrorized by s slasher in the midst. Really gory something to occupie the kids. Rated R: for Violence, language, brief adult situations."
4,A Scream From Start To Finish! 4 1/2 Stars!,"Scream: A Screenplay is the original uncut script for ""Scream"". It has cut scenes, different lines, and, if this was the way they shot the movie, it would have been way too predictable who the killers were but, luckily, in the movie they took the scene out. It also has pics from Scream and Scream 2 and an intro by Wes Cravan! A totally worth- while read!"
5,The Coolest Horror Movie of the 90's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Scary but mostly gore in Scream! Neve Campbell,Drew Barrymore,Skeet Urlrich,Matt Lillard, Rose McGowan & Jamie Kennady star in the funniest/scariest movie of all time!!!"
4,Good background and pictorial of Classic and Vintage T-Birds,This book provides an in-depth review of the development of the original Classic T-Bird and also dispels certain myths surrounding the Early Birds. It also provides excellent detail photographs for the restorer or enthusiast to use as reference in putting their Bird in order. A must have addition to the Early Bird enthusiast's book shelf.
4,Black and White Bliss!,"For a T-Bird restoration enthusiast, this book is an amazing resource. The pictures are mostly in black and white. Color would've made it '5-stars'. Nontheless, without a shadow of doubt the book itself is truly a T-Bird lover's collector item. There is a great lot of detail on the A-40 (1954-1957) models. Since I'm doing a 1957, it truly works for me."
5,Thunderbird an illustrated history of the ford t-bird,This is a nice coffee table book. We want a t-bird one day. Why do you have us to this for every item? It seems a little un necessary.
2,Not so great...,"I had high hopes for this product after all the hype from Oprah and reviews. Well, could just be my body, but it did not work for me at all! I am 5'6"" and 140 and wear a 6-8 and all I wanted was something to help hold in the tummy and smooth the bulges. It does do that, but with-in one minute, the top is rolling down giving me the ugliest ""muffin-top"" I have ever had! I ordered this with the Spanx Camisole and tried tucking the camisole in... NOPE! The camisole rolled up and the bottoms rolled down. My husband had a really good laugh and said something about it looking like sausage casing. Not exactly the look I was going for. Both the bottoms and top will be returned. Try Sassybax ...much better!"
1,no motion so might as well throw in the ocean,"light looks nice and lights up great but regardless i even had a electrician look at it , could not make work on dusk to dawn and or by motion detection !electrician told me after the fact of my purchase that these type devices have a poor rate of proper function .well he sure was correct about my purchase this summer. not worth the trouble to send back but now just use as a standard on off carriage light."
3,One Important Thing is Missing,"The only thing that is missing from this DVD is when Hillary Clinton came onstage, she was heartly booed. I have the live video from VH1 and it is funny to watch. I was at the show, and people where shouting at her and her husband.Besides that The Who stole the show...."
3,Great in some places terrible in others.,"I did see the live concert on VH-1. The quality of the DVD is great (as would be expected from a DVD). They did a good job of cleaning-up the audio. The Who was awesome as well as most of the other performances. HOWEVER, they cut out the second Eric Clapton song as well as the first song performed by the Goo Goo Dolls in favor of stuff that was utter [disgust] (Jay-Z, Jimmy Fallon's 80's melody, Hillary Clinton, and Slick Willy just to mention a few). And speaking of Hillary, they eddited out the boo's and hisses when she took the stage and replaced them with more cheers. Nice rewriting of history, but what else do you expect from a bunch of socialists. If they didn't like boo's and hisses, why didn't they just completely get rid of Richard Geer? He was a joke! For all of the edditing, they did do a nice job making everyting flow (especially with Melissa Ethridge)."
5,couldn't ask for more!,When I watched this program on TV that night I was mesmerized. I am so grateful I was able to get my own copy.
3,GOOD,"I bought this as a gift for my brother-in-law, a musician. He liked it very much. Although there are many interviews and other non-musical footage in between, the live concert itself and the music is great."
4,Excellent except it has been censored,"This video is great except it has been censored. My wife and I watched it live and when Hillary Clinton came out, she was boo'd but when we bought the video and watched it, they replaced the boo's with cheers. It should have been left the way it was.The producer must be related to Michael Moore!"
4,a surprise!,"The concert was a bit long, featuring some very poor performances. I was actually blown away, however by THE WHO. For someone who has never seen them, and has heard very few of their songs I was floored! GREAT JOB!! Paul McCartney was good,as well as james Taylor and Jagger and Richards."
3,not the whole concert,"This is the 9/11 concert in MSG - it is not the full concert, U2's brilliant performance is not on this... very disappointing to find that out so buyer beware."
4,Two OF the Great Vocalists Ever,Sarah Vaughan&Billy Eckstine Sound Good on this set.at times the arrangements don't always do them Justice but overall their vocal Power can't be denied.it's a treat having Two OF THe Greatest Vocalist ever Singing TOgether.Worth a Checking into.
5,Smooth as Satin,"Incredible! That's only word I have to describe this recording. The beauty of these two combined vocalists is awesome. It's one to cherish because Eckstine and Vaughan actually didn't record together that much, which is a surprise considering Sassy always considered Billy her mentor and great friend. The vocals are as smooth and polished as one could hope for, but not at the expense of Berlin's sentimentality and emotionalism. This is an unforgettable meeting of two musical forces. Billy has rarely topped his rich baritone vocals here and Sassy complements him beautifully. The orchestration, while saccharine and maybe a bit TOO polished at times, frame the voices beautifully. All 11 tracks are recorded splendidly, including one solo song by each."
3,"The ""mix"" on some of the duets is distracting.","The choice of songs is pleasing and the solos are ""easy listening."" However, the duets don't rate the same description. When Sara Vaughn has the melody, Billy Eckstine's harmony is great. In reverse, with Vaughn singing the harmony part, one would think she still had the melody. I suspect it is the mix on the recording. Whatever the reason, it is a strain to try to hear Eckstine's melody when it is overpowered by the harmony. It makes for a disappointing experience."
3,Very Disappointing,I never understand why manufacturers of a great product have to change the design but that appears to be what happened with this dustpan. My daughter has one that she bought a few years ago and it works beautifully - there are never any small lines of dirt or dust left at the edge of the pan - but hers has a small rubber strip at the bottom of the pan and that must be the reason why hers works so well. I bought one this December because my cheaper dustpan always left that line of dirt but the newer version doesn't have that strip - and it does leave a line. So now this dustpan doesn't work much better than cheaper ones.
5,"Very nice little dustbin, good quality","Like most OXO products, this is a bit more expensive than other options, but also a bit better quality than other options. I like the rounded end and the way this helps join the brush to the pan. Works well."
2,Terrible at Picking up Cat Litter!,"While the broom itself works fairly well, the dust pan doesn't lie flush with the floor. This means it's impossible to get fine particles into the pan. I continue to sweep and there's always a fine line of cat litter on the floor. Since that's the main thing I purchased it for, it's a complete waste for me. I'm now off to search for a stand up broom and dustpan instead...hopefully one that will pick up traces of cat litter. If only I could train my cats not to track litter or to sweep up after themselves..."
1,wow! the worst brush in the world,"My old dustpan and brush was getting a bit nasty, so I ordered this as replacement. It really didn't pick up any dirt at all. Amazing how useless a product can be. I'm still using my old brush."
2,Doesn't work very well,"The dustpan and brush look nice and handle fairly well also, as expected from an OXO Grips product. Unfortunately the dustpan doesn't sit flush to the floor, so when you sweep dust and garbage into the pan, half the dirt misses the dustpan."
2,Didn't work for me,"I ordered a half-dozen different pairs of Hue tights and love them all except these pantyhose. The top of the panty--where the waistband would have been--rolls down creating a thick, tight band of fabric. I phoned Hue and they graciously offered to refund the cost of the pantyhose. Great company, but this particular style didn't work for me."
3,"Mediocre - but wait, there's more!","This is the third studio album for Marty, and it doesn't measure up to the first two. It is darker and doesn't have the fun that was present, especially on the ""One Night With A Stranger"" album.HOWEVER - the full box set has been issued and includes ALL the songs from the first three albums. Blind Records has it and it would be THE set to get if you are a Briley fan.I happen to have all three albums on vinyl and am glad to be replacing them, as I have worn the grooves right out of the first two."
3,"Good book, but a little too basic","It is a good book, but I was expecting something more complete and ""in detail""."
3,"Basic Information, Little More","This book seems a little outdated and is a slim volume. The photos are colorful and well done. For someone who knows nothing about Conures and parrot species in general, it may be a good place to start. I found the explanatiion of Taxonomy to be beyond the the average pet owner needs or even wants to know. The book had a clinical, scientific feel to it, but did little to explore the joys of owning one of these highly intelligent and affectionate birds. If your budget can only afford one Conure book, you should pass this one up. For those collecting books about these faciniating parrots, it's a good addition to your parrot book library. Those wishing to start breeding their own Conures will find the section on breeding helpful, it provides a good overview of the process and is something that is hard to find in most books about particular parrot species."
5,Five Star PLUS novel,"This book is absolutely incredible! I love metaphysical fiction and this book tops my list by far. F.P Dorchak not only entertains the reader, but cause them to think, contemplate and fantasize about a variety of posibilities and situations. This author caputures the reader to the degree I felt as though I was part of the mystery. This book was excellent the first time around, and if it is at all possible, it was even BETTER the second time! This book is a must read for anyone who enjoys adventure mixed with mystery with a hint of curiousity added in!!"
5,New Territory,"Franks book touched alot of new territory for me. It opened up a whole other world of excitement and drama. Some of it went over my head to the otherworlds that I will wait to explore with his next book. Couldn't find a place to stop alot of the time, so finished sooner than expected. Excellant work ."
3,"Fascinating subject, lousy writing","I was really eager to read this book. You don't often see metaphysics in novel form. I wish Mr. Dorchak had the talent to tell this story better! There's a lot of teenage-style angst about what it all MEANS, terribly self-centered, as if the main character and perhaps Dorchak have no idea that these questions have been asked by anyone else, ever. The writing is frequently stilted and just bad (""Linda and him""). The German trainer at the gym says things like ""Choo been holding out on me...? Dat's not a good ting choo do..."" Too bad, since there's a good story to be told about a middle-management type suddenly forced to deal with multiple realities."
4,"Great story, difficult to read","This is a fascinating account of a young man who in 1910 decided to see the world without money. He worked and walked and even took a few photos with his ""kodak."" I bought the kindle version, which apparently was scanned. It was difficult to read due to low contrast and small type which couldn't be altered. And of course the pictures were impossible to make out for the same reason.But it's a great story of the world before mass communication stretched tribal boundaries from the village scale."
2,"Good handle design, poor steel quality","just like other reviewer said, after 5 or so dozens of oysters, the tip of the knife got bent and now it is difficult to use. Need a knife with better carbon steel blade. Just bought two Dexter-Russell knives with 2 3/4 and 4"" blades - expecting better results"
5,Great for amateurs.. like me!,"After reading all the reviews on here, I find it a bit funny that so many amateurs and first time shuckers are having success with this knife while ""4 star chefs"" and all these other professionals are having such a difficult time with it. Well, I'm a pro oyster eater but never successfully shucked a single oyster myself until I bought this knife about a year ago. I have no idea what the proper techniques are, all I know is I was finally open oysters up myself with this knife! I can happily report that my knife is still going strong and I am back here because I'm about to purchase a few more for my mom's house. Haven't tried other oyster knives yet (just been unsuccessful with screwdrivers and butter knives) but at just 8 bucks a knife, it's totally worth it! Btw, I rarely do reviews but I love oysters and this little knife so much I just had to. Happy shucking!"
1,"I'm an amateur, Love OXO products, hate this knife","If you are a first time shucker, who plans to open through the hinge (as most guides and youtube vids will show you), DO NOT BUY. I'm normally a big fan of Oxo Good Grips products; I own at least 10 other kitchen gadgets they make and LOVE them. This knife, however, bent out of shape after shucking barely a dozen oysters. My suggestion is to buy one from whoever sells you the oysters. They know what they're doing, and the knives are usually very cheap in price, but solid in their construction.Generally, I'd recommend people stay away from this knife."
5,Worked as expected.,"The knife worked exactly as expected, comfortable grip with a sturdy knife...no problem at all to open oysters.Highly recommend it any one."
4,good quality,great ergonomic handle the blade is made of good quality steel and does what it is intended to do i would recommend item to my family and freinds
5,Works GREAT,First time cooking oysters and the knife was wonderful-- My husband got the knack quickly and was easy to use
1,Dont waste your time,i bought this oyster knife because i work in alaska and i have to shuck oysters daily i went to use it on the first oyster and it bent it took me over an hour to shuck 6 orders (36 oysters) which normally would take we 20-25 mins so i suggest that you do not buy this knife go to a local kitchen supply store and purchase one from them
1,useless,this thing is useless I was a chef for over 12 years and have shucked hundreds if not thousands of oysters and this by far worst knife I ever used it bent after 1 use
3,"Good design, but poor quality","This knife has a good grip and a good shape, but the quality of steel is very poor. After 5 dozen oysters, the tip of the knife is bent and it is very difficult to work with it now. This is not what good steel is supposed to be!"
1,wimpy wimpy wimpy,"the first time this oyster knife was used it bent itself silly within 6 oysters, and it was in the hands of a 4 star chef who knew what they were doing.dont waste your time and money..."
1,"small head, off balance design - not worth the price","light, small and narrow head and with a heavy handle. A bit off balance for use around kitchen. As the handle is too heavy, you loose the feeling of connection with the broom head, compounded with a small and narrow head, I have a difficult time picking up things from the floor. Not as expected from read the reviews. In comparison, my old one from local home improvement store is much easier to handle and faster in cleaning the floor. I realized that it had a wider head and lighter handle which you can use by one hand and have a great connection with the floor. It is almost parallel with the feeling on the steering wheel in cars. To me, the OXO is more expensive but hard to use. It is solid build but not ideal around kitchen or inside of the house. in fact, I am not sure where it would be an ideal use with the rather limit head. I am 5' 10"", male."
3,OXO makes great products...but came up a little short here,"OXO makes great stylish products, that one can always count on to be durable and useful. With this broom OXO came up a little short. First, when the broom was delivered it looked as though it had already been used. Also the head of the broom was a little small. OXO still delivered with their trademark rubber grips which makes sweeping a lot more comfortable. Who knows maybe with this broom I can even get my boyfriend to sweep for once?"
4,Comfortable buy-it-once broom,"It's a little spendy for a broom, but it's comfortable! As with all OXO stuff, it's pleasing to the eye and has that soft rubber grip that's easy on the hands. High quality, can't imagine having to buy another broom after this one. Works great!"
3,"Broom nice, packing problematic","It might be good to review how to best pack this admittedly difficult-shaped object for shipping. I got the broom and the first thing I used it for was to sweep up some plastic pieces that had broken off from the base during shipping (the packaging was essentially sticky plastic sheeting wrapped around the broom twice). The broom works well and I'm not going to bother returning it, but there wasn't the normal ""ooh, something new"" feeling . . ."
1,Don Henley is a tiresome kvetch!,"If you want to encounter a textbook example of the ""Hollywood Left"" in all its absurd contradictions and vanity, go no further than this album. On the one hand Henley rails against corporate greed, Reagan, and America's sins, while on the other, he strikes a careful fashion pose on the record jacket, cigarette in hand! The entire record preens and struts this multi-millionaire's moral superiority without a shred of irony concerning exactly who it is who's lecturing us. Undeniably, Henley has his share of talent, particularly as a singer. He chooses good collaborators to give his more popular songs a distinct sound, i.e. the Bruce Hornsby piano chord pattern echoing thru End of the Innocence. But it is ultimately shallow and uninspired. Henley wants to be Bob Dylan, but in the end he's closer to Barry ""Eve of Destruction"" McGuire."
1,Was he really a member of the Eagles...,"Together with the other guys in Eagles, Don Henley assured his immortal place in rock history. I wonder - how can a man who was a part of something so great as the Eagles release such a [bad] bunch of songs? I just don't get it! I owned this album for many years but when it was time to ""weed out"" my cd collection I decided that this one have to go. But before I sold it, I wanted to record the best songs from it, but I must admit that I couldn't find a single song I really like. So, now it's gone, and I have not missed it for even a split second!"
5,Henley's best,"THE END OF THE INNOCENCE influenced me greatly a dozen years ago when I was in my late 20's and faced crisis regarding the direction of my life. It would be silly to attribute life decisions solely on music (listen up to the cowards who blame crime on Rock-N-Roll), but Don Henley issued a batch of songs so brilliantly reflective and wide ranged I have to thank him for the help. Eagles fans would probably disagree, but I think this is the best work of Mr. Henley's career, including his contributions to the great Eagles albums of the 70's. My favorite of the rockers on this album is I WILL NOT GO QUIETLY. All of his softer material here is equally moving. Buy the CD. It is truly timeless!"
1,not what I expected,They might as well have been the pointed ones which I already have. The slant is too oblique for me; I can barely catch anything. I just got back from buying a pair (same brand) that I could inspect before purchasing; less slant and work well.
3,Doesn't compare to Rubis,"I bought these to replace an old pair of Rubis combination tweezers, but they just don't compare. (My Rubis still work, but are a little beat because I used them for things other than the intended use.) The Tweezerman tip is larger, and doesn't come together as well. The stainless steel material is not as heavy as the Rubis. They might do the job, but I returned them and will order another Rubis for the quality. These measure approx. 3 3/4"" length."
3,Great if you get a non-defective pair,"My sister has a pair of these and loves them. I love her pair, too.Unfortunately, I have not been able to get a good pair myself. The one I ordered from Amazon was defective - the tweezer only met at the tippy point, not all along the slanted edge as it's supposed to. Amazon sent a replacement and that, too was defective.I gave this product 3 stars because I know they can make a great pair of tweezers, just not reliably. I would suggest purchasing these from a retail location so you can inspect the pair before you take it home."
2,A total pain,"I have plenty of Tweezerman tweezers, these are by far the worst. The product was as described, but as far as tweezers go stay away if you're using these on yourself (especially if you have fine hairs). It requires a lot of pressure to grab the hair, and it's really difficult and uncomfortable to do it on yourself. I'd recommend every and any other model of Tweezerman tweezers over these."
1,Doesn't work,Tweezerman makes great tweezers but these are not very good. They break the hairs instead of pulling them out. No bueno.
4,Perfect for a Sunday Afternoon Read,"While others have compared Emily Eden to Jane Austen, Eden's character development and plot are clearly not up to Austen's brilliant writing standards. These simple morality tales/romances make enjoyable fiction, without being heavy, philosophical, or brilliantly written. However, these delightful stories are sweet and fluffy, perfect for a light read!"
3,Pretty,"Moodsville was a subsidiary of the Prestige family of jazz labels; it was originated to spotlight jazz musicians in the ballad setting (1960s edition of bedroom jazz or jazz to eat dinner to). The most successful of the three or four dozen albums that were produced were the ones where at least on a tune or two the musicians were allowed to up the tempo a little bit. Otherwise the same slow tempos tended to become monotonous (unless you ate fast and changed the record). Unfortunately, that was not the case here: all 7 tracks, two of them blues, are done slowly. By far the best track is EARLY MORNING, a most attractive 12-bar blues and, ironically, one of the best tunes found on any of Oliver Nelson's Prestige/New Jazz/Moodsville recordings of the period. Not an essential recording (except for the above mentioned track), though Nelson fans will want to have it. Lem Winchester is on vibes and Richard Wyands on piano."
2,What happened Lars?,"Lars' side project appeals to me because it songs pretty much exactly like Rancid, and their first CD was pretty awesome, a solid punk album for all fans of Rancid. They were a safe haven from the transplants stuff and Skinhead Rob's rap. This record is not bad, in fact the music is actually really good and some of the tracks are legendary (1% and Skins, Punx, and DrunX).There is one problem, and it's BIG!The lyrics drive this album right into the ground. After the fifth or sixth song about prostitutes and how we're gonna screw them and then kill them, you're about ready to put this CD away for a long while. I agree with the guy who said that the album booklet was completely unneccessary, and even Tim Armstrong couldn't pull ""My Life to Live"" out of the fire.This is just mediocre, bottom line. I know punk lyrics are nothing deep, but c'mon guys, spend more than half of five minutes and write something at least decent."
2,This could've been something,"Now it's official Rancid have not only turned their own albums into garbage but their side projects are starting to suck too. This album has a few decent songs but it doesn't even come close to their first album. Also Lars and Tim are talking about sex and prostitutes , how freaking macho they are. I thought they were supposed to be punk and above all that stuff. Sometimes with all the shout out and city droppin "" Shout out to Oaktown"", it just sounds like a transplants album especially with Rob Aston in the mix that guy could ruin Kurt Cobain coming back from the dead and recording a new Nirvana album. Overall there are some ok songs but nothing memorable and also their are some laughable songs in which Lars tells us how much of a thug he is, ""Switchblade""."
3,good some of the time,"yeah this is pretty much average in my book.it suffers from the same disease as the first transplants album and rancids indestructible album. that is it can be amazing at times or it can be very dull. take the first song for example..""bastards"" lyrics make me wanna yawn and i usually find myself skipping it. and the second song made me laugh when i first got this because it made Lars seem in love with farts that were ""Silent But Deadly."" (i know its SPD not SBD) the lyrics suffer for the most part. that last song..oh man..where do i start. Lars, your life is cool and all but man that track Viking makes me laugh. all in all, good buy if your a rancid fan, if your the purest of the pure type person i say avoid. yeah get their first cd and all the rancid albums minus indestructible before this though."
3,Just Okay,"Being a big Rancid fan I am automaticaly drawn to this album. While it does hold up though it fails to step out of the shaddow Rancid has cast. While Tim Armstrong was able to crate something competely new with the Transplants, this sounds like a Rancid release with all songs sung by Lars. The inclusion of Amrstrong vocally, as producer, and songwriter also does little to solidify Lars' ""solo"" credibility. If you are a Rancid fan you will enjoy this album. Just don't expect too much."
4,Not bad,"8.5 STARS OUT OF 10I'm a huge Rancid fan. As you can imagine, I was pretty excited about a second Lars album coming out. Lar's first album surprised me in how good it was, and I was expecting more of the same with Viking.When I first cracked it open, I didn't care for it. It seemed all over the place. The first and last few songs had a Rancid 2000 feel to it. Throw in a couple of covers, a ballad, a few mainstream punk sounding songs and you had Viking. It wound up in my CD case after about a week.A few months later, I decided to pop it back out, and I can say the album really grew on me. It's sometimes hard, sometimes soft, but always catchy. As usual, Tim Armstrong is all over the album with his lyrics and even a guest appearence.Much better then 99% of the junk out these days."
5,EYE CANDY,"This book is Awesome! So many beautiful homes, I don't know if it makes me happy to see it all, or depressed that I'm not a billionaire! Oh, Well, we can't have it all, but having this book can make you feel like you do.Keep it in your living room for your friends and guests to see, they will spend hours w/their noses in it. 1,000 pages of delicious architecture. Highly recommend."
3,Coffee table variety,"This is a handy coffee table variety book, with very few drawings, and though it gives the overall idea of the houses included, as most of them have been constructed in the '90s, it is by now quite dated."
5,A great tool,This product is wonderful. You can get any cookie off the cookie sheet without scratching the non-stick surface. It is also useful for removing bits of things left on non-stick pans. It scrapes almost anything off anything without leaving a mark. It isn't a heavy duty spatula and It wasn't intended to be used for heavy food or scooping. I love it and have bought several for friends who love it.
2,not too good,"i have been on a quest to find the perfect spatula and i thought this would be it. the first couple usages were great, but then they started to get really stained and no matter how hard i scraped and scrubbed, i couldn't get the bits of food off them. in theory, it's a great idea but actually using them is not. i cook every day and need a sturdy utensil. this was not it. i am still looking for the perfect spatula !"
5,Replacing a favorite,"My mother bought this spatula for me 7 years ago, an like the one star-er I thought this thing is hokey, thin and cheap.... until I got to know it. This spatula is the very best tool in my kitchen along with myFox Run Stainless Steel Magic Whiskreally absolute favorites.I just purchased three of these spatulas because my roommate killed my original.I highly recommend this small wonderful addition to the kitchen"
3,Broken after 3+ years of everyday use,"I have had this spatula for over three years and it has been my go to utensil for cooking with my cast iron pans. It's thin and flexible, but not at all floppy, making it easy to slide it under fried eggs and other delicate items in cramped pans where a more rigid spatula won't do the trick.The reason I'm giving this spatula only three stars is because after three years of use the spot welds that hold the metal spatula blade to the handle have come undone on one side. The spatula is still usable, but I'm weary about the other side coming loose soon. I originally bought this spatula because it was pretty inexpensive, I remember only paying $5 or $6 for it. If that were still the price I'd have no problem writing a glowing five star review, but at $13 I think the product should last a bit longer."
3,A little disappointed,"Makes turning eggs, etc. easier, but eggs want to stick to the spatula. So, that totally negates the benefit of the spatula... I have had their other products and am a little disappointed in this one."
5,Nice spatula,"I bought this spatula on the nice write-up by America's test kitchen. I had a few plastic ones that were really getting on my nerves. They would stick to eggs when you tried to turn them over, causing as mess. This new one works great. I'm glad I bought it."
3,A very poor product,"I dont know what I was thinking when I bought this product. Like who really needs a flexible spatula--it holds nothing. Back to the old-fashioned ""pancake turner"" for me or in some cases ""nylon pancake turner"". Was really disappointed as OXO makes such great products for those of us who have arhritis."
4,Great spatula for specific tasks!,"Would you have just one spoon, one wisk, one measuring spoon? Probably not. This spatula is just the right one for eggs, as everyone else has already indicated. I see where someone dissed it for cookies. I find just the opposite. It's the best spatula ever for getting cookies off the baking sheet. It is not to be the sole spatula in the household for sure, but for specific tasks, it is SUPERB!"
3,Not quite Evanovich,"A lot of comparisons were being made between this series and the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich. While there are some similarities, this book didn't quite grab me like an Evanovich book.....which I will normally read in one setting! Sierra's poor use of the English language was very distracting to me as a reader. I guess my English teachers pounded certain rules into my head a little too much!"
2,Cheap entertainment,"Fans of more skillful Florida mysteries such as those by John D. MacDonald or Carl Hiaasen will be left wanting by this tepid first novel by Nancy Bartholomew. Her Philly-born exotic dancer heroine, Sierra Lavotini, is a mass of contradictions, but for all the facets Bartholomew tries to build into her, she remains a warmed-over knock-off of Hiaasen's sleuthing stripper from <Strip Tease>. Sierra's poor English makes for a distracting narrative voice and, unfortunately, Panama City is never more than a flat backdrop for the plot, which could just as easily be set in Myrtle Beach, Padre Island, Daytona Beach, or any one of a number of other southern spring break venues."
1,A gift that disappointed,"A friend gave me this book for my birthday, and though I wouldn't tell my friend this, I found this novel dull. It's too bad that this writer felt it necessary to take a small story about one young woman's (Maya's) bad relationship choices and draw questionable parallels with political strife in Israel. The plotline that follows the lives of three women seemed to fall back on Israeli ""types"" of women rather well drawn characters. As one who's quite familiar with Israeli political history, I felt this to be a misguided attempt."
2,Disappointing characters,"This book looked so promising and turned out to be such a disappointment because the three women are all such weak characters. I associate Israel and Judaism with strong people, both male and female, and I felt this story was very untrue to both the place it's set and the people. I was impatient and bored with the three central characters because they were so blandly rendered and so uninteresting.It's too bad the author didn't use some of the more interesting supporting characters in more important ways. I really can't recommend this book to anyone."
1,Interesting issue,"Simple. Ankerberg and Weldon in their continuing quest to bear false witness for profit. They've been busted on misusing Pike's work (antimasons never get around to quoting the preface, it utterly destroys their case), claiming false Masonic rank for their ""experts"" (this is know as lying) and quoting from rituals that were never used by any regular Masonic organization.Considering Revelation 22:15, I'd seriously wonder about these two gentlemen. If you start with Exodus 20:16 and follow through, the burden of proof falls on them to repent and be saved. Old and New Testament, failure to keep the 9th commandment almost invariably points to both a false salvation and other sins.Amazing how these guys make a profit for their ""ministries"", while most of the Masonic sources that blow them out of the water are freely available on the Net."
1,Zzzz...,"i could only read an hour of this book. harvest house should b more selesctive of what they back. confusing details, winded, nowhere going."
4,excellent and a half,"It is amazing how well this work holds up almost forty years after release. While Vertigo had the best--if not the most well known--opf progressive rock, they also had hard rock units and Thin Lizzy was one.Johnny The Fox is chuck riff heavy rock that still sounds great. This band locks tight and grinds hard on riffs more complex than they might actually sound.While prog was for 1970s eggheads, Thin Lizzy were the turf of the kids not going to college, working in the factories and gas stations. There was a whole substrata after the counterculture of teens with limited prospects, who wanted to party, not protest. Thin Lizzy, like label mates Black Sabbath, where the voice and the bump and grind for these teens.But listen today, and you hear the complexity of the riffs, the tightness of the playing, and the bands ability to make these tracks sizzle. Take any digitized rock band on your Ipod today, and this almost forty music still blows it out of the stadium at 25 paces"
5,Classic Rock Album Ignored!,Thin Lizzy made classic rock albums and radio and criticsingored them in America. They were big everywhere else inthe world! This album proves they were just as good if notbetter than the so called greatest rock n' roll bands thatare still played on radio. This album is one of the greatestrock albums every made and Thin Lizzy is the greatest bandin rock history as far as I'm concerned. If you don't havethis Lizzy album or any buy it and them and hear what realrock music is suppose to sound like! Johnny the Fox is a classic.
3,"Not the best album, but it was great live!",Johnny the Fox was (I thought) underwhelming as an album. Myopinion changed dramatically when I saw it performed live aspart of the Bad Reputation tour in 1977 at Winterland in S.F.Wow!Some bands were just better live and this was certainly true ofThin Lizzy.
1,"Not Worth the Money, Even at a Low Price","I ordered this without benefit of having seen the previous reviews. Having taken the Russian river cruise, I was looking for something visually impressive by which to remember the sights and the journey. Unfortunately, this was not it. I concur in everything in the previous reviews. The content is superficial at best and does no justice to the country or to the cruise. The folklore show to which so much of the DVD is devoted is actually only an optional tour on most of the cruises, one which we elected to pass up with no regrets, while many of the more important sights were completely omitted. Finally, the photographic quality is just dreadful, not much better if any than an old home movie. This is not worth the money at any price."
1,Poor quality is the theme,This homemade DVD should not be something advertised for sale along with the professional quality DVDs that are also sold by Amazon. What a disappointment for me and a waste of good dollars.I would like my money back.blueskycinnamon@gmail.com
4,Hard Drivin' Rock & Roll,"Grew up watching these guys in the DC area. One of the best bar bands in the area. They add new life to such great classics as Can't Get Next to You, Little Sister and Heat Wave. Not to mention Stop Breaking Down and Memo From Turner. The music is raw and unrefined but than what would you expect for true rock and roll. This is a must for any Jim Thackery/Nighthawks fan."
5,My Meditation Chime,"I am a happy owner of this product. Hehe..Pro: Beautifully crafted. Beautiful sound. Compact, and travel friendly.Cons: When I recieved the chime, I realized that it does not sit evenly on an even surface. (Sad)However, I have found a fix for that! I sticked two 3M small-size black rubber anti-slip mat on the base of my chime - My chime now seats comfortably on any solid surface top.Click on the link below (Woodstock Chimes Official Website), you can play and hear a media file of the sound of the chime.http://64.106.200.92/woodstock/public/publicCat15403Home_Chimes.html"
4,It gets their attention!,"As a teacher this gets their attention without using my voice, and that's a great thing!"
3,Just Okay,"I bought this item to use as a classroom management tool. I have had teachers use chimes in my own classes, and they worked very effectively. I went for the cheapest option, with only one bar. Looking back, I would have upgraded to a two or three bar chime, which is what my teachers had used. To get my students' attention I have to hit the chime hard, which causes a very high pitched noise that hurts their ears, causing the students to make more noise from groaning and complaining. The chimes with more bars do not need to be struck as aggressively, and thus avoid this high pitched, unpleasant noise. So, the chime is a good idea, but splurge for the chime with more than one bar."
5,Perfect; crystal clear tone,"I love this little chime. I'm using it to start and end my ""quiet time."" The clear tone lasts longer than you might expect, and I love it every time. Worth every penny!"
5,Woodstock Percussion Zenergy Chime,I really love the sound of this chime. I have it on my altar and use it during my meditation practice. I highly recommend this product.
2,It works,"The product is as advertised. It is visibly cheaply made. The wood and metal detail is sloppy. The metal rod was not in good geometric alignment with the wood. Pushing both ends of the rod with my thumbs while bracing the wood with my fingers, I was able to get the rod to look OK and to sound a little better. I've seen a better version of this sort of chime and it sounded far better.You get what you pay for. It works."
2,the sound was not great,"the sound was not too nice, I am not into music so I did not know what to expect.. however I do suggest the trio chime is sounds very pretty I might say. this solo one is not a good purchase.."
2,Zenergy Chime,There have been a few times where the I have been able to hear the sweet resonance of the chime - I have not yet mastered the art of the right touch and it often sounds clangy and discordant. Much possibility - how much practice is enough to deliver it consistently?
5,Great for calling dogs in,"I have the single chime. I got it for a group I am facilitating to signal the end of breakout sessions etc. I discovered a secondary use however; if you ring it at the back door, the dogs stop everything and run in. They usually came to me because I can whistle, but my husband was having trouble getting heard. This is a very sharp tone. Even if the girls are having a heated discussion over the fence with the dogs next door, they can hear this chime. And it's much easier on the neighbors late at night. Highly recommended."
5,Chime sounds great,The chime looks good and has a great sound. I put it in a nicer box and wrapped it for a retirement gift. Bought another for a friend that just completed a yoga instructor training. 1-Tone Chime
4,Delightful,Kaplan's settings for the Old Testament texts are refreshing and delightful. I had put off actually purchasing this collection for far too long. Each piece stands on its own but the album can be treated as a suite as well.
4,That's the time....,"...when I feel like making love. Always a challenge to sing these wellknown songs. But Karin and her band give there own touch and they do it well. Listening to the CD I was pleasantly surprised about ""Sorry seems to be the hardest word"", but ""The Moon is a harsh mistress"". I never heard a better and more appropriate way of performing of this song. Love you, Karrin! Karrin shows nog only to be a good singer, but gives something extra to it that cannot be put into words. 'Feel like making love' is a beauty and 'The first time I saw your face' dweeps with the heavens. There is really something to get here! A band that understands her and a singer who sometimes touches the beauty of eternity! Love, Joop"
5,It's been worth the wait,"Karrin you never let us down! Karrin's beautiful voice and unique interpretation, breathes new life into songs we've known all our lives. Very nice listening indeed! A great smooth late night listen!"
1,SCHMALTZ! Embarrassing to listen to,"These covers are simply awful. Karrin Allyson does not need to make a departure from what she knows and does best. From the tacky cover art to groaners like ""Wild World"", it's obvious that she and Concord Records need to regroup and get back to jazz. Into the used cd bin for this one. Looking forward to better things from one of my favorite JAZZ singers."
2,I heard it in the background,"I heard this recording in the background while dining outside in a lovely wine bar setting. Wow, I thought, good stuff. After downloading this via Amazon, I can now say, it's only ""so, so, material"". Nothing orginal or creative. I love covers; however, expect the covers to reflect the performing artist's own personality and style. Ms. Allyson just doesn't do it for me, and hey, I live in Kansas City. Overall, I find her vocal work as nothing special and the arrangements to be less than out of the ordinary. I say, if you wish the standards, the classics to be ""today"" try Holly Cole. Perhaps, Ms. Allyson should also take a listen."
5,Well worth the money,"I've been looking for a strainer that I could use to rinse both rice and quinoa and wasn't having much luck. This strainer cost more that I thought I'd have to pay, but it would work for my purpose. I'm really glad that I spent the money and purchased this strainer. The mesh is fine and the strainer is well made. I'm so glad I spent the extra money, this one's a gem."
4,"Great for coffee, rice, etc","I wanted to start cold brewing coffee, and bought this strainer to do large batches. This item is also great for rinsing rice, quinoa, beans, and even small quantities of pasta. Love the versatility."
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,I've been using this strainer for a long time now almost daily and highly recommend it. It proven to be sturdy and durable.
3,Works great until...,"I had one of these, worked great until the handle broke off and I lost a whole batch of noodles into the sink of dirty dishes...."
3,not so sturdy,"I was disappointed in the insubstantial feeling and quality of the stainless steel....made in China, btw. I doubt it will meet the requirements of durability and longevity I had come to expect from OXO.Frankly, I am disappointed."
5,Very sturdy - worth the money,"I bought this at Whole Foods for $22 plus tax, because I needed it right away. It's cheaper on amazon, but still pricey for a strainer. You may wonder why it costs so much more than other strainers.Well, as one other reviewer pointed out, it actually has a double layer of mesh, making it mush sturdier than other strainers, and able to keep its shape. Nothing out there compares.I used it to sift dry ingredients for baking, but I also intend to use it to make vegetable stock. You will not be disappointed with this strainer!"
3,not very deep...,"I was looking for a replacement for a 8"" deep strainer & came upon this one on Amazon. I used the demension of 8"" to decide the size strainer to purchase.I chose Oxo because of their quality & reasonable pricing. It is good quality as expected but to strain off a package of spagetti, it is a challange. Though I did purchase the right demension I did not get the correct depth & I figured wrong that this product would be deep enough :(The next time I purchase a strainer I will check for the depth demension too. Other than my oversight, it is a good product & should last for years to come...."
5,I love this tool!,"Bought both the 6"" and 8"" Oxo sieves. Useful every day for cooking tasks; for boiling little bits of things to go along what's in the pot, or for straining what comes out of it. Great size and sturdy construction. (Although I think they are too expensive. After all, they are only strainers to remove water from food.)"
5,Perfect size,"This is an absolutely perfect size. It is not so big that you won't find a place to store it, but large enough to hold a bunch of angel hair pasta that would slip right out of the little holes in a traditional colander. It also fits over the sink so that I can pour the pasta (or whatever I'm draining) right into it, water and all, and have the water drain into the sink.It doesn't say in the description, but this is a double weave strainer. In other words, there are two layers of thin metal mesh to ensure even the smallest seeds and particles are caught in the net.It has a traditional soft black rubber Oxo handle, too. This is important when using it over the sink as it keeps it from slipping around when the water hits it.Nice!"
5,Great little strainer.,"The mesh is double which makes it very strong and the handle is comfortable and strong... It is great for small items that might go through the holes of another strainer. This is the best mesh strainer I have. It is small in size. I love it for tiny pasta, crushed pineapple, etc."
5,Yay!! Quinoa doesn't fall through!,I was looking for a strainer that would keep quinoa from falling through. This one is perfect. Other reviewers said it was good for quinoa.That was a deciding factor for me. So thanks to the people who thought to mention it. This strainer is well made and seems sturdy. I'm very pleased.
4,Sturdy & Reliable,"This strainer is perfect for small jobs around the kitchen (I use it for draining freshly squeezed lemon juice. While it seemed a bit pricey, it's strong construction and reinforced edges make it the perfect kitchen tool!"
1,Worst Low Budget Film Ever,"This has got to be one of the worst low budget movies of its kind. I have never seen such mess. The actors cannot act at all, the sex scences are ridiculous, and the story line is horrible. They should be ashamed of putting this mess on the market to sale. It wasn't even worth the few dollars I spent on it."
1,Watch out - no return policy,"The fire extinguisher arrived with the pressure gauge just barely inside of the green zone, which I consider unacceptable charge for a brand new unit. But when I attempted to return this unit, I got a message that this item is a fire hazard and cannot be returned to Amazon. The customer should dispose of it in accordance with Local, State and Federal regulations. Tis ""no return"" policy is not mentioned anywhere on the original screen with description of the unit. And if the item is defective, we customers are supposed to just throw it out. Thanks for your ""Easy Returns"" policy, Amazon!"
5,Home,just wanted to say this is a great piece of equipment that should be in someone home. never can have to much safety items in the home place.
1,Beware- one use only,"I had to use this fire extinguisher for a kitchen fire. It worked well, but then the gauge pointed to ""recharge."" Today I tried to find a place that would recharge it. Found out that an extinguisher with a plastic handle cannot be recharged. The label on the canister states ""Extinguisher must be RECHARGED by a qualified fire equipment service company..."" This leads one to believe that recharge is possible. The label should state ""ONE USE ONLY. CANNOT BE RECHARGED."" I am upset because I now have to put the cylinder in the recycle bin. Seems like a box of baking soda would be a better and more ecological solution."
1,Discharged in box,"I'm afraid I have a review similar to ""Westphalia."" Mine had also discharged in the box. Everything was covered in white powder, and the pressure gauge indicated that the bottle was empty.I'm not sure if this is because of poor construction by Kidde, or if it is because of bad packaging. I can say that there was very little packaging material in the box, so it had plenty of room to jostle around.Just contacted Kidde customer support, and they directed me to Amazon. Hopefully I can get somewhere with them.*UPDATE*I contacted Amazon customer service through email, and they are placing an order for another extinguisher at no cost. Great service. Hopefully this one makes it intact."
1,Empty product!,I ordered two of these and came with the gauge reading empty! Amazon does not take returns on this type of product!!
4,For our daycare,One of the most affordable type 1A10BC fire extinguishers out there. Also easy to find in any hardware store. I bought one as a requirement for a home-daycare. Approved by the fire marshall without any problem. Came with its own plastic wall attachment accessory. Easy installation. I feel I have to reinforced the gypsum wall attachment with a double-sided tape to make sure it is secured.What does 1A10BC stands for?The number preceding the A multiplied is by 1.25 to give you the equivalent extinguishing capability in gallons of water. The number preceding the B indicates the size of fire in square feet that an ordinary user should be able to extinguish.A = ordinary combustible materials such as paper.B = flammable liquids and gasesC = energized electrical equipmentHopefully we would not have to use it in the future.Made in Mexico.
4,Nice Size,"The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars because I didn't use it. Hopefully, I will never have to use it. The extinguisher is not big like you would see in a business, so it's lightweight. I actually like the size because it's more portable. Make sure if you buy it that it's full by reading the gauge."
3,As represented,"Nice fire extinguisher for home. Hard to rate without having used it, which I hope to avoid! Otherwise, feels solid and as represented online."
5,Good,"I have not had to use this (thankfully), but wanted one in the house for safety. The instructions are clear and easy to interpret. It is a good value and good safety item."
4,"Seems ok, but how would we really know unless...","Seems ok, but how would we really know unless we had a fire to test it on. So I'm giving it 4 stars for looks, price, and the fact that it comes with a full-empty gauge and mounting bracket.5 stars if it's not empty when/if I need it, and successfully puts out the fire quickly."
4,Seems good and stable,"Received this on time and well packaged. Easy to mount on the wall and hold with the help of the bracket. All in all, hope I never have to use it, but in the possibility that I do need to use it, it looks promising enough to be a good buy."
5,Fire Extinguisher,"I bought two of these extinguishers-one for myself and one for my son and his family. I have never had to use it so, I can't know how it works, but I'm hoping I never have the need to see how it works."
2,a bad surprise,"When I open the box, the powder was scattered everywhere, the lock was not in its place, and the pressure only less than half left. It was terrible! What was very hepful was only that Amazon was willing to return my money."
2,broken at arrival,I got the product in broken condition at arrival - the nozzle was broken. All else seemed fine but I dont think I can use it.
3,Filled,"A lot of comments stated that this particular extinguisher arrived empty/emptied, so I was a little hesitant.Mine arrived full, and as described. This is not a refillable, so I have not tested it. But it will serve its purpose in the kitchen I'm sure.If you are buying for a garage I would definitely purchase a higher quality extinguisher that has the capabilities of being refilled (as these with the plastic head/nozzles can not), but for a kitchen or something for a one-time use I feel this will be adequate.---EDIT 11/11/2011---After a year of non use it's almost in the red (Empty).So pretty much, this was like a $25 insurance with a one year expiration.I think when this ones done for I will spend the extra money and get a refillable."
3,Dented But Do-able,"Hey, I got a great deal. I am happy. I picked up two of these, one for the truck, and one for the rented mule, er, room I have near work.They are alright for the job.If it goes down, empty one on it and bolt.Stuff is insured or replacable, life is not. Not yet.Mahalo for the decent deal. Watch for dents."
4,You cant really test a fire extinguisher..lol,Smaller than I expected. But cute. Had a heck of a time snapping the mounting strap around the extinguisher. The strap was too small. Extinguisher too fat. I hope it works if I ever needed it..lol
1,Bad purchase,"I purchased this fire extinguisher and when it arrived, it was COMPLETELY EMPTY! I contacted Amazon and did get a refund."
4,Hope I don't need it!,"It seems to be a good Fire Extingusher. I believe though if I bought another one, it would be a ""refillable one"". Seems like such a waste to use it once and then discard it."
4,GOOD HYDRANT,good hydrant i'm glad and blessed i had the chance to have this in my life. thank you god. love u
2,Damaged Delivery,"Hard to say how well the product works because I got it delivered and the box was damaged pretty badly. The indicator also showed that it was only about 70% full. Fortunately, Amazon gave me a refund and didn't even require me to send it back (I believe because of some mailing restrictions re shipping hazmat). So basically 1 star for the product and 4 for Amazon."
4,Hard to judge a fire hydrant,"It came in good shape, with the gauge indicating it was full. It's a nice size and isn't unwieldy to pick up. Other than that, I can't rate it since I won't use it unless I have an emergency."
5,Nice compact extinguisher,Got mine at the local Home Depot for $19. Opened and checked it in the store to ensure it was fully charged and there were no leaks. Looks sturdy and well built. I can't comment on whether it works and how good it works until I actually use it...and this is one product I hope I will never have to use.
1,Not a good quality shirt returned it / return policy negative,found shirt to be lacking in quality more like a 20 dollar throw awayreturned shirt and discovered negative return policy to be in placefound same pattern & better quality shirt for less elseewhere
1,"Boring, poorly shot","I wasted money on this based on the wonderful Amazon Recommendations. I think this is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen. It was poorly shot, even for a low budget film, and was very boring. The acting was bad, almost but not quite humorously so. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,80s Schlock,"Oh dear. This from one of the Eagles??? Obviously Don Henley was the Eagles and Glenn was a passenger. OK, I haven't heard any other GF albums and I won't bother on the strength of this. 1 star each for Two Hearts and Soul Searchin' (nice backing singers) but I'm afraid that is being generous. If you have the money to buy this, Don't! Buy anything from the Eagles or Don Henley."
1,A lot more searchin' needed,"Glenn Frey's Soul Searchin' isn't good. Very 80s sounding album with little to offer and a lot to annoy. I mean, coming from a founding member of The Eagles this should at least have some good tunes on it. Instead it's just one of those terrible albums that came out during the worst period in the history of recorded music: THE EIGHTIES. It's best avoided."
3,A mixed quality bag,"The print of The Cat and the Canary is pristine; absolutely beautiful (I would give this film 5 stars). Unfortunately, the other movies in the collection did not get the same restoration treatment. The Ghost Breakers looks awful - full of 'sparkles' and other film artifacts - it has definitely not been restored.. The others vary in quality. I bought this collection for Canary (which has been a favorite for years). But you should be aware of the variation in quality of the different films here."
3,"""Uncle Cyrus' ghost must be holding bank night""","So many great lines in the Bob Hope CAT AND THE CANARY, which I've been praying to see in a real DVD release for years. All the other Cats and Canaries pale!But I hate this habit these DVD sets have of putting one decent unreleased film in a set with a lot of repeats and filler. The Paleface? Road to morocco for the 11th trillion time? Hell, why didn't they include 'I'll take Sweden'?"
4,good tight miter box,This miter box is metal and has nice tight tolerance. I use it to cut nice even cork fishing rod handles and works great for that.
2,A toy for craft or model work,"Nice tool, if you're only doing craft or model work. I'm not, so it wasn't a good fit for me."
3,Not as good as expected,"My children just love Lego Bionicles and they watch the Bionicle videos over and over so of course, we eagerly awaited to get The Legend Reborn to add it to our collection. Too be honest, it was very short and both my boys(age 6 & 9) were disappointed. The story did hold their attention to get through it once, but it definitely did not hold a candle to the 1st three Bionicle videos. Plus,they have never asked to see it again. I would suggest renting it or borrowing it unless you are a die hard fan and must have it for your collection."
3,Amazon on-line movie Bionicle: The Legend Reborn,"Kids loved the movie, I did not enjoy buying a movie and waiting for buffering during viewing. So, I am hesitant to purchase rights to watch other on-line movies. It may have been an unusual occurance."
5,I Miss Me/ I Meant to,"I think this man is brilliant, both in his song writing and of course his raw talent of just singing. On top of that he is a whiz on the keyboards!!! Not too bad to look at either!! This whole album is awesome! My only question is...where is he now? I wish radio and CMT/VH1 Country would have played him more, they didn't seem to give him enough air space, too bad, it is our Loss-Let's hope and Pray he keeps pushing the pavement cuz he is so talented...I want to hear more! If you want to hear one of the best new singer/songwriters of this decade...RUN to buy this CD, you can't be dissappointed-I promise!"
5,I loved Brad from the beginning - these songs are great,I love both of these songs. I actually think I like I Miss Me more than I Meant To. I hope he has a long career. He really has a terrific voice and it is perfect for country music. I saw him on the Grand Ole Opry and he is just adorable and very appreciative. I cannot wait for his album to come out.
1,Not worth it,"The DVD was defective, but from what I could view of it, it was not worth it. Don't waste your money ..."
4,"Pretty Decent Crab Crackers, nothing to write home about","These OXO Good Grips Seafood and Nut Crackers work pretty well for the task at hand. They have a good heft to them, are sleek polished stainless steel with rubber inserts, and appear to be assembled with high quality in mind. The heft, notably, is advantageous for dispatching fellow diners or dinner guests who attempt to take more than their share of the crab legs. I find a quick ""whap"" upside the noggin reminds them that ""there are other people."" Similarly, should your crab bake be set upon by agents of a foreign government, these crackers would make a handy boomerang at some range. Closer up, one might be able to use the ""Nut Cracker"" option to incapacitate the interloping ne'er-do-well. All in all, good crackers!"
2,Silly and corny,"I have seen George W. Bush on TV many times but I confess I knew little about him. Watching this movie, I do not feel that I have learned much about him or what drives him. I could not even identify the character I have seen on TV with the actor. I then read up on George W. Bush in the Wikipedia and I do not think that this movie is a fair representation of the man.The acting itself is not particular good. No character struck me as playing particularly good except for Toby Jones.The filming was only ordinary."
2,"Love Nixon, not W.","i saw nixon the day prior and to say i was let down by this one is an understatement... brolin was decent, whoever played the part of rice was horrible... it just seemed like a really poorly acted, scripted movie... no insights, no real life portrayals of the struggles in the white house, especially between bush and cheney in the later years... turned those 8 horrible years into a joke... a horrible joke most of us have suffered through..."
1,W. ow,"I can't believe such high caliber actors would embarrass themselves to this degree.Josh Brolin...Richard Dreyfuss...James Cromwell...Jeffrey Wright...Toby Jones...Ellen Burstyn, etc. I literally felt embarrassed for them. And you know some of them probably did this for free just for the chance to ""show the Bush administration.""There are movies that are bad...then really bad movies...then bad ""made for TV movies"" and bad movies barely show on TV. This movie is the toilet paper in the dirty bathroom of the gas station where bad movies barely shown on TV buys its cigarettes."
5,BEST MOVIE OF 2008!,"This well crafted fascinating movie with bravura performances by all should have been awarded the best movie of the year. Josh Brolin's performance as George W. Bush was outstanding and the performance of Richard Dreyfuss as Cheney was a pleasant surprise. As much as I dislike the worst President and Vice President in history Bush and Cheney, I didn't want to be reminded of what total lowlife scum they are and how they hurt us, our country and worldwide reputation, but enjoyed this amusing and entertaining movie. Put this one on the top of your list to see!"
2,"UH NOT EXACTLY SUBTLE, OLIVER","There was a time, very long ago, that Oliver Stone made relevant movies, granted he always had an ax to grind, but his movies were not provocative, just to be provocative. W. is a perfect example, it's obvious Stone is no fan of the former president, but he tries I suppose in his own warped way to understand Bush, and im sure he feels he was fair, but really this is just a badly filmed pseudo intellectual mess. The performances are all over the place, it's like the actors are as confused as the director. Brolin is passable as Bush, but he really doesnt ever make you forget that you are watching a caracature..the rest of the cast does sort of bad imatations, with the execteption of the singular Cromwell as Poppy, not really sure 41 was like this, but it's a riviting performance none the less..but really there is nothing to recommend here..it's Stone at his most indulgent..granted this mess is not as bad as Alexander..high praise indeed."
3,W.,"Could have chosen someone who favored W. Bush a lot better. Should have stuck to more historic facts. Almost tried to be a comedy, when I expected a true to life fact filled movie."
4,Skeptical,I was very skeptical about this movie as I didn't like the idea of making fun of a President. I did enjoy it and it was not as bad as I heard it was.

1,Unbox not always Reliable,"After I downloaded the movie W. , the movie stops playing at 1 hour 42 min. I have deleted the file and the Unbox player and reinstalled and downloaded the movie and THE EXACT THINGS HAPPENS AGAIN AT THE SAME TIME AS BEFORE !! Amazon has really disappointed me this time because the purchase is useless to me. Even the troubleshooter within Unbox cannot fix this AND AMAZON STILL HAS MY MONEY FOR ONLY 3/4th of a movie that I paid for. I am thinking that I will go back to BlockBuster movie downloads in the future since I have no problems with digital downloads with that company. As of this date, 3-8-09 NOBODY FROM AMAZON has contacted me for a resolve to this issue. How 'bout that customer service ?"
1,Huh?,"I realize I am a latecomer in the reviews for this film, and Obama is succeeding in his competition for the title of our worst president (isn't it convenient that as of yesterday, he is able to take credit for killing Bin Laden...just in time for his re-election campaign?). However, I expected much more from the director of JFK (which still doesn't do justice to the conspiracy, but at least debunks the Warren Commission).I'm only about 1/2 an hour into this film, and I have already spotted some glaring errors. There's Phi Delta Kappa, the fake fraternity that W is shown being initiated into (apparently Stone has been intimidated into keeping silent that W is a Bonesman), and W claiming to be a Texan (he was born in Maine) and an Episcopalian (he's a Catholic), and there's still another 90 minutes to go!The best film out there if you want the truth about both W and 911 is Alex Jones 911-The Road to Tyranny."
1,"Wendy rates ""W""","I think the movie, ""W"" was well-done, although it's not my favorite. That's probably because it's about politics, one of my least favorite subjects. Richard Dreyfuss and Josh Brolin were the only actors I knew by name, but the movie still held my attention with all the punches 'George W. Bush' gave; that was what made the movie interesting."
2,Far from good,"I didn't need this boring, long winded movie to tell me just how insane, stupid and inbred that man really is. I was awake for the last eight years. Try to avoid this movie, unless you weren't."
1,W. didn't tell us anything we didn't already know.,"W. didn't tell us anything we didn't already know. Although George was almost charming in this movie, it didn't tell us anymore than we've already seen on CNN. Personally I was hoping to see a little about the year before 911 and maybe some Paul O'Neil."
1,W,"As usual, we have a producer/director that thinks he knows what's going on in the world; when, in my opinion, it's all in his own mind. The movie, in my opinion, is totally slanted. Portraying W as weak and readily lead to decisions by any one. Tell me, those of you that think that you are so intelligent, what would you have done if you were president when the tragedy of 9/11 happened? How about having the worst hurricane season right after? No, the problems in New Orleans weren't W's fault after Katrina. Look to the governer and mayor (who was elected again although he let New Orleans go to hell during Katrina). At some point the people in the US have to start taking responsibility for themselves. Do I recommend the movie W? Only if you want to push your problems off on the government. Then again, if you want to do that, you have to go back many years."
3,"Like ""The Doors""","Were you present when Jim Morrison died? Neither was I, nor Oliver Stone so we are left to speculate. You can research all you want about W, but in the end, who can say for sure. Perhaps not even the Uniter himself.With no disrespect, I think he is best forgotten--not the subject of a major movie."
3,Better for laughs than for info.,"It's basically a big let's laugh at george w. bush fest. Although if you can look past it, you gain pretty good insight into what was going on in the administration and the personalities of each cabinet member. And also of Bush's relationship to his father if it's portrayed accurately. I watched it hoping it would be a little more serious, which at the right times it was, it's just that George W. Bush's character is so obnoxious oafish and distracting I felt like I couldn't really pay attention to the plot. I just felt like it was really made to get the audience to just laugh at bush, which I was hoping it wouldn't be."
4,A good character study,"This was a good character study of George W. Bush.his life and the influences various people had on his decision making process. It does have the Oliver Stone slant, but that doesn't seem as evident as in his other movies. The ending was obviously meant to be symbolic, but of what remains a mystery to me. Not finding WMDS?"
5,Good Movie,I like this movie because it told me what I already thought was true. Once again seeing how the / or our Government works.
2,Just for the history,This movie is worth watching only if interested in some facts and history. The world's rotten politics is amazing. The politicians and analyst are worse.The acting is not worth mentioning. This is not a recommended movie
4,Interesting biopic,"The Bottom Line:The spiritual successor to Stone's ""Nixon"" (and a better film, in large part because it's an hour shorter), W. is a surprisingly empathetic biopic that follows the classic Greek tragedy form of a man undone by his flaws--in this case, that he's just not smart or strong enough to be President--to tell an interesting, if probably largely fictitious story; if you're interested in Oliver Stone or the Bush presidency the film may be worth looking into.3/4"
3,Not to interesting,Some of this movie is interesting but it is definately not something that will keep you awake. If you're tired I would suggest not watching this movie. The way George Bush made his way to the presidency was interesting but the remaining parts of the movie could have been left out. I should have read a review before purchasing the movie.
2,Caricatures and cliches,"In this movie George W. Bush is depicted in his early years as a hard-drinking, opportunistic, ne'er-do-well who bumbles through life riding the coattails of his distant, disapproving father. Later on, after a moment of conversion, he is shown as a simplistic, religious fanatic who bulls his way to the presidency and who seeks nothing more than a kind word from George Sr. Each of the characters is instead a caricature and the movie is full of misrepresentations and giant leaps of assumption about the interactions and motivations of the major protagonists. ""W"" is depicted as a cowboy who jumps on his horse and rides it to the bitter end, insisting that he is always right and never makes a mistake. Oliver Stone's comment that this movie is not political is ridiculous and is only superseded by his assertion that he got ""into the skin of George Bush"". The sad truth is that he never even scratched the surface."
3,Disappointing....,"If you are looking for factual details behind historical events...or even an educated guess on what goes on behind the political curtains...you will be greatly disappointed in this film; however, if you are looking to be entertained by a toned-down version of the media's portrait of this President's personality (yes, it's superficial)...you may find it amusing. Bottom line...buy this for the mild entertainment factor, don't expect a history lesson."
5,Excellent!,"I hate George W. Bush as a president. He has done more to divide us as a country and tarnish our reputation around the world than even Nixon. He deserves far worse treatment than he's given in W. However, that treatment has been dished out in so many documentaries over the years that it has become trite. For Stone to make that type of film at this point would be just as trite. It's easy to to condemn his empathetic exploration as some sort of pardoning or endorsement of what Bush has done. That is not at all the point the point of this film. Stone has repeatedly criticized Bush on his actions. He calls on those actions in the film as well. It might not be as heavy handed as most of us want but it is indeed there. I judge a film by how much I get absorbed by it and W had me quite engaged. The acting, directing, writing, and cinematography are all solid. There are flaws. It could have dug deeper into significant events. Still, I highly recommend it."
3,People and fish can coexist!!!,"Great performances abound in this mildly interesting doc about the inept boozehound that stole the throne in the Oval office. It shows you a glimpse of his party life in college, his pathetic attempts at sustaining a ""real"" job, and his incessant family afflictions.But W avoids being too political, much like Dubya did himself. Although it comes off at times as somewhat critical of the president, it also avoids much of the controversial and significant moments in his presidency. Like the doubts surrounding the election, the speech to rally public support for the War on Terror, and the inexcusable reactions to Katrina. By dodging these topics, it leaves you feeling disappointed and manipulated. Another well-made but ambiguous version of the truth by Oliver Stone."
1,Abysmal movie both directing and content or lack thereof),"This is one of the worst made movies I have ever seen. It is a mess, tells the most confused view of Bush I have ever seen, suggests there was a little good a little bad in the man, nothing new and no insights either good or bad. What a waste of time (for reference Fahrenheit 911 I thought was brilliantly made - one either hated it or loved it, but it was well made and sure got its point across.) W gets nothing across other than the director had not a clue about what he was doing or even trying to do."
5,New view of Bush,"The frightening thing about this movie is that it makes you feel sorry for ""Dubya"" rather than hating him. Definitely not what I was expecting. But excellent, and interesting none the less."
4,what happens when a muddle-minded mediocre man becomes president?,"Stone follows the bizarre rise of the most improbable president in our nation's history. A basically hollow image who became the most powerful man in the world and proceeded to turn it into a mush-minded, bloody morass. Great actors in supporting roles, and a virtuoso performance by Brolin. A deft and provocative study of the banality of evil."
2,Shallow,"Not much needs to be said about this film, because the film didn't have much to say either--nothing new, at least. Any American who has been at least semi-conscious for the past eight years knows that Bush got us into an expensive war based on false information put forward as absolute fact; failed to capture and punish those responsible for 9/11, that Bush countenanced war crimes by Americans; that Bush violated the fourth amendment to the Constitution; that Bush had people held without charges, without legal representation, The list probably includes another list of things we don't yet know about.Oliver Stone's film covers the Bush administration, but so what? Tell us something we don't know. The acting is mostly okay but a little wooden at times. Brolin's Bush comes across as a buffoon, an ex-drunk who used religion as a cover for his sins. But everyone already knew that.I wouldn't recommend this film to people of any political stripe. It's just not worth one's time."
3,Pointing at others,"All movie attempts to present Bush Jr. as a cheap shadow of his daddy, Bush Sr., look mostly like the funny bubbling of own kid nasty sometimes but always ""own bastard"".Oliver Stone's speculations of Iraq and Afghanistan wars would much more convincingly sound if for start the predominant majority of American voters reject, once and forever, a non-stoppable usage of their personal cars in big cities to ease dependence on energy sources well feeding terrorists back on the American soil de-facto absorbing increasingly for ""humanitarian reasons"" new waves of terror breeding seed."
2,Stone goes easy...,"but even that is cutting. You watch and say ""He was elected twice!"" What will future generations say?"
2,Boring,A let down...pretty boring. I didn't even finish the whole thing. I rented it mainly because of Josh Brolin and his past roles.
2,Am I missing something?? Did the above 2-star reviewers actually see this movie???,"The only reason I gave this 2 stars and not one star is because of Josh Brolin. And did Chris Crocker write the script? Because this movie is too sympathetic. In fact, it should be called ""Leave Bush alone!"". Granted, Brolin's performance is great. It's almost like watching George W. himself play the role.I agree this movie had lots of potential. It's a look at George W. Bush's presidency, and I admire Stone for trying to do that. Howver, just because you did it with ""JFK"" (which is a fantastic movie IMO), doesn't mean you should do one for Bush. That said, this movie fails to reach its potential because the whole time it seems as if it's trying to get us to sympathize (sp?) for Bush.There are some good moments in the film and they do highlight some of the actual events in Bush's reign. But other than that, unless you actually do sympathize for Bush, this movie is a complete waste of time."
3,Another average movie from Stone,"It is clear that this movie was made by a Bush Hater I watched it out of curiosity and did not find the movie as entertaining or factual. Once again a movie that portrays conservatives as idiotic and evil.However it was well acted, Josh Brolin does a good job, however looks old when he tried to play W in college. Oliver Stone stumbles badly because he tries to hate the President and tries to suggest that all his decisions were driven for the approval of his father. I would recommend it only if you miss Bush. I know I do....I used to love Oliver Stone but he has not made any notable movie lately, to make matters worse he is recycling his old movie material watch out for Wall Street 2."
3,Good potential that goes unrealized,"Here's a movie from Oliver Stone that turns out to be very restrained, somewhat drawn out, and ultimately not that compelling. There was so much more that could have been done here, but too much time was spent on W's daddy issues and his ballpark fantasies. Also, there should have been some mention of W's bungling of the Katrina hurricane disaster.That said, Josh Brolin got the inflections down just right, while Richard Dreyfuss virtually stole the show as Dick Cheney. The flashbacks were not confusing, and the choices of songs were perfect.A mixed bag."
1,W = BS,"So easy for people to applaud a movie like this when you still have both of your legs, are NOT on almost 10 medications just for your head alone due to severe PTSD, nightmares and panic attacks... Oh, and you basically don't LIVE at the VA hospital and don't have the privilege to compare mental inpatient treatment programs across the globe about every other year. I am only 32 years old, for Christ's sake (which is actually OLD compared to most of the injured vets that have come home/coming home)! His place in history for me? A murderer of my comrades as well as The American version of a ""dictator."" ... And I may actually have to tell my grandchildren (if I live to have any) that this man was my ""Commander-In-Chief."" Yes, I am extremely angry, and have every right to be. It will take me AGES to heal. Now choke on that. I guess ignorance really is bliss, heh."
1,Political Cartoon,"This film is just a political cartoon showing a caricature of George Bush. I've seen George Bush interviews on TV many many times. I've read books about Bush from several different authors. (I read a lot of books about historical figures.) My Dad has interacted with George W Bush. The film fails to show the friendly compassionate Bush that so many talk about. I'm no fan of George W Bush's politics, but this film is a flat one sided approach to a person who has a friendly compassionate side that doesn't show up in the film."
2,W the movie,"the acting was good, I thought it was a fair depiction of our former president. Not too negative and not too positive, The acting was very good"
2,A Project that Misfired,"As one who had read quite a bit about the Bush Family and about W himself, his life, childhood and personality, this movie was a big disappointment. Giving ample space for artistic license, which I actually encourage, this still was too much caricature and too little authentic truth to leave a credible impression of what ""w"" really was like.W's story, told with sensitivity and depth, and without rancor, is actually quite sufficient to carry a meaty if not a robust plot. However, this ""cartoon of W"" should have been beneath a filmmaker of Stone's caliber. This movie even casts a negative shadow over some of Stone's earlier work, which I actually thought was quite well done. However, in light of this ""rush to judge"" W badly, Stone screwed up.I left the movie thinking more about Stone than about ""W"" and that is a statement in itself.Two stars"
3,Not a Bush bashing film,"Going into this movie I figured it would be a Bush bashing film. I was wrong. It was actually very balanced and an interesting look into the former president's life. His hard drinking days up until when he quit drinking (age 40), was an eye opener and almost disturbing at times. Another head shaker was his father (George Sr.) bailing ""Junior"" out of one mess after another and the film depicting George W. as a perpetual party animal, time waster and unable to stay gainfully employed until he stopped his boozing. It is a worthwhile watch. BnB Beatles Depot"
2,Suprisingly dull,"You can usually expect intense, provocative movies from Oliver Stone. He achieved something special with JFK and Nixon. I was expecting this would also be provocative and really have an opinion about Bush. Instead, its just a boring, standard biography. No insight or and special messages.A real disappointment."
5,The Moneychangers,"I read this because it was by Sinclair Lewis and wanted to know more about what he wrote. I was amazed how close he was to present day problems where greed takes control of political forces. Amazing easy read that shows things never change, they just get more tech involved. I read the free Kindle version."
4,Don't look back,"This was the Everly Brothers ""comeback"" album. It is a good album. I especially like the Everly's version of ""Lay, Lady, Lay"". Here is the track listing:1. On the Wings of a Nightingale2. Danger Danger3. Story of Me4. I'm Taking My Time5. First in Line6. Lay Lady Lay7. Following the Sun8. You Make It Seem So Easy9. More Than I Can Handle10. Asleep"
3,Ok Reunion Effort -- Sounds a Bit Dated Now,"I like this record, a comeback effort produced by Dave Edmunds. Edmunds punches up the sound, the guitars bear his trademark sound, and there is a fine song penned by Paul McCartney as well as one by Jeff Lynne. What I find difficult when listening to it now, however, is the cheesy 80's synthesizers which back up most of the tracks. They distract from the fine songwriting and make you think The Thompson Twins are about to join them at any minute. If you can get past that it's worth picking up."
1,"Yep I agree, it's cheesy","The acting is absolutely terrible, and the Mom changes her opinion much too fast, even after the horrible people she has to deal with at NP Enterprises. Save your time. This movie sucks, and the ending is completely bad."
2,cheesy. I had hard time even to finish it,"It is so so cheesy. If you want to gather your family to see a fun movie to get you in the mood of Christmas then do not waste your precious time on this movie.They try to make you think the good people are bad and creepy,, then at the end,,, here is the big surprise! they were not bad after all.. .. the mom did not believe in Christmas or Santa ,,, the kid did.. The kid will do his best to convince mom that Santa is real!! the acting was not that great as well. I am glad I watched it before I get all the family together."
4,It's cheesy but festive,"This is a cheesy Christmas movie and the acting is not fabulous. Patrick Muldoon looks like he's been drinking a lot for a very long time in my opinion. The mom is a bit too cynical and if my kid ran off all the time like her's does, we would have a serious discipline issue going on! However, I have a large Christmas movie collection and I do DVR this on TV every year so I wanted to add it to my DVDs."
1,Worst Christmas Movie ever,"It's been said before, but the boy is soooo obnoxious. He runs off and disobeys his mother through out the movie. It seems insane that a wealthy banker would become a short order cook in a dive diner. The auto mechanic is rude, and the setting is like any other small town with touristy looking people in shorts. It is not what I picture as ""Christmas Town"", as it looks like it's 75 degrees outside. Someone told Patrick Muldoon that it's cute to not ever comb your hair. I had to look away..."
2,Nearly unwatchable,"Setting aside the bad sets and the retread over 15 min. of the main plot points (Yes, we get it, she works a lot).The child actor they hired for this was ridiculous. They had a kid who looked older, say 12, acting in ways that would have been forgivable for maybe a 6 year old. I don't know if the kid they cast is that way or if the director has no children, has no neices or nephews and possibly has never met a child in their lives, because after 15 minutes of his whining we were going to turn it off, and only kept watching because it was so bad it became fun to make fun of.Also, one thing that always makes me suspicious of some reviews, are when the people who have given a movie 5 stars have never reviewed another movie on Amazon. Sounds like somebody got a friend to write a review for them. Seriously, there are some wonderful Christmas films out there, and there are some very decent made for TV movies. This just isn't one of them."
5,Christmas Town,Enjoyed this movie very much. Great family movie. Patrick Muldoon was also great in A Boyfriend for Christmas. He handled his part very well. Will watch his movies and enjoy them during the whole year.
1,Apparently not remanufactured,"I did all my research and finally decided on this coffeemaker. It had great reviews and a great re-manufactured price! When it arrived, I got it all set up and made a pot. It was great coffee and the perfect temperature. That was the first and last pot of coffee -- the clock quit working, the programmable feature quit working and even the on/off buttons did nothing. So, it is on it's way back to Amazon. Though I am disappointed in what I received, Amazon has been very easy to return it to (and they are paying the shipping on the return, so I am not out any extra money). They cannot replace it (Amazon does not have any more in stock) so I am awaiting a refund. I'd rather have a working coffepot, but it looks like I'm back to researching coffepots!"
3,Outlasted the warranty,Bought it in 2007 on Amazon for $30 with a 90 day warranty. It worked perfectly for 6 months then died. So I've got a $30 Thermal carafe that works great when I have company and need more than one pot going at once.
4,"Not her typical English setting, but still worth a read...","I have been a huge fan of Joan Aiken ever since I read Nightbirds on Nantucket in grade school. This book departs from her usual British ""flavor"" but I still found it fascinating. The characters and plot resonate with you long after the book is over. People who are familiar with the King Arthur legend will get the most from this book, as some of the references are hidden or not explicit. One caution -- there are some disturbing images (as there are in all of Aiken's books) and I would not recommend them for young or overly sensitive children."
3,very strange and not at all worth reading,"I love Aiken's Wolves Chronicles, but this one isn't even worth being part of the series. It's fairly good writing, and a pretty interesting plot, but it has no relevance whatsoever to the rest of the books. For some reason, Aiken leaves off with her pseudo-Dickens mode, which makes this book a lot less amusing. The legends of King Arthur and Guinevere that play such a major part in this book are completely improbable. Read it, but not as part of the series."
5,Rhymes and reasons,"Most of the material for this book was gathered fifty years ago in British schools, but I'm sure readers in all countries, for all time, will find it amusing and revealing. When I'd finished it, I felt I had a greater insight into children's minds and concerns, which they express, of course, in the games they play and the rhymes they say. I felt at the same time great respect for children. For unasked and unobserved, they have been keeping our traditions alive for us. Many of their dictums and ditties have changed little for hundreds of years. It seems that all the Barbies and Action Men and other expensive toys can't distract them from this valuable and enjoyable task of conservation."
5,so far so good,"I've tried other soap dispensing brushes, they've all fallen apart (or, leaked) within 6 months. I'm on my second month with this one, and everything on it looks solid as a rock. I'm hoping to pass the 12 month mark with it and at the moment I'm expecting to do so."
2,Oxo Dish Brush,I have many Oxo products including the older version of this dishwashing brush. The new one has a removable/replaceable brush which I thought would be nice. But the brush often comes off. Needs some tweaking before I'd recommend the new version.
5,"Which ""I"" is me?","My first reading of this book was like a casting off of ""dogmatic slumber"" for me. Never had I read a work that laid out so very clearly and precisely what is required to work upon ourselves and begin to live intentionally in the world. This is not only the first book to provide someone interested in the Gurdjieffian 4th Way, it's a pivotal work for anyone demanding more of themselves and life than what is provided by alleged exoteric authorities. There are more tools for change in this small book than in many massive tomes offering similar tools for self growth and change. Highly recommended."
4,Good product for what you need,"I purchased three Rubbermaid 5 gallon water coolers for use with our running group. We use them every weekend and haul them all over the place filled with water and/or sports drink. My only complaint is the lids will leak even if they are screwed down correctly and tight if they fall over. If you don't put the lids on right, they will also leak while hauling them about as the liquid splashes inside the container. The lids sometimes take a time or two to screw on correctly as the threads don't always line up correctly the first time. Insulation is ok, about what you'd expect from a cooler like this. All in all, very pleased with the product as it has held up well over the last year of being hauled all over the place. One last thought, make sure you unscrew the lid slightly when you're ready to use as it will sometimes create a vacuum which will keep the spigot from flowing."
3,"screw top rocks, leaky faucet stinks","I simply love the fact that if this cooler gets dumped out of the truck or boat or off the porch, that nothing spills out. The screw-top lid is the most secure of all.But the problem is with the spigot design. When the rubber ""cover"" gives out, you've got a leaker. What a bone-head design. I'm going to seal up the spigot hole as I don't use this cooler for water anymore. It was used for that for a couple of years, then became my camping/fishing/truck cooler. Now it is side-lined until I repair (permanently) the leak.I'll buy Igloo the next time i want one of these type coolers-especially if I want to depend on it as a water cooler. But also note that I'm very hard on coolers."
5,Fantastic Masher!,This is a fantastic kitchen tool for mashing vegetables. While we primarily use it to make mash potatoes we also use this to help mash avocados when making guacamole!The masher works great and is very comfortable to use for long periods of time which really helps when making a lot of mashed potatoes. The masher is well constructed and feels like it will last a long time. For the price I don't think you will find a better masher out there.We have washed it in the dishwasher many times already and it has come out clean and in perfect condition each time.
5,Superior design of handle and mashing head,"I was able to mash 7 large potatoes into creamy perfection within 10 seconds. I've never been able to do that before. Better than even a food processor.The handle is shorter than most mashers, allowing superior leverage. Plus, the size and design of the mashing head allows the potatoes to freely squish through the masher, making it easier and not allowing overmashing. The potatoes are mashed perfectly."
5,Finally,"Finally I can make mashed potatoes without using my mixer. I am a quadriplegic/tetraplegic (C5-6 for thos who care) and I can use this tool. Traditional potato mashers just require more grip than I have in my hand. Plus the horizontal handle makes the pushing easier, as well.My mother with mild arthritis likes this as well as her traditional masher.As with most Oxo tools it is highly ergonomic: it fits the hand and does the job it's supposed to."
2,sticky fingers,"This does mash nicely, but if you use it in more than a very small pan, you get your fingers covered with potatoes! The handle is really too short, and I don't actually find it ergonomic. It makes you get in a slightly strange position, since your hand has to be clenched on the top rather than gripping from the side. I'm buying something else!"
2,Handle dissambled,Within four months one of the handle was dissembled. Otherwise it was good. I have nothing to do with this now :)
3,Bent within 2o minutes of using it.,I was using it to press down cabbage for sauerkraut and not potatoes so that is why I didn't give it 1 star. Anyway it bent on one side after about 20 minutes.
2,"Ok, not great","I received this as a wedding gift (we registered for it). It's alright, but I find the mashing head is a little too narrow, making it difficult to get an even mash quickly. The base where the metal arms connect to the head gets gunked up very quickly and it's really tough to clean thoroughly. I like the large, wide grip, but that's about it. I'm asking my grandmother if I can have her old potato masher from the 30's, which has a much wider head on it and mashes more evenly and more quickly."
1,Wasn't impressed,"I wasn't impressed with this item for one reason. It arrived at my home broken. How well made could it have been if it arrived in two pieces?I have loved all the other OXO items that I have purchased, but this one was a loser."
4,One minor flaw,"This is an excellent masher. If you're doing skin on potatoes it clogs up slightly - but still made short work of a few batches of mashed potatoes (with and without skin) & mashing up sweet potatoes for another dish.The one flaw of the design? It's short handle. However, it's not a deal breaker. In fact - the plus-es of this more than made up for it's sole shortcoming. My old masher (vertical handle) was about the same height and had the same issue.There's only one masher I've used that I liked as much as this one - but it was literally twice the price (it's a Cuisinart model). However, I would still choose this one over that other model because there was no hand fatigue with the Oxo. My family loves mashed potatoes and when I make them I make a lot. This was definitely put through some trials for Thanksgiving. I'm looking forward to using it for Christmas, and for meals in between."
4,Nice tool,"Bought this for my daughter - who has managed to destroy 2 other potato mashers - didn't even ask how. Know OXO makes a good tool so I thought she could try this one. It does its' job fairly well and she says she is happy with it, but she is waiting for the day she can inherit the potato masher that my mother used, I currently use - and was bought in 1955. The two side bars does make it a bit harder to use in certain pots - and it is short for some taller pots - but nothing you can't work around."
2,Not what you see,I bought this swaybar bushing kit for the front of my 07 FX2.All you get is the bushing for the front swaybar to frame.No greasable brackets.or endlinks.I guess I didnt read good enough.
1,Don't believe what you see,"Picture shows bushings, brackets and end links,but all you get are the two bushings. Am i supposed to know when it says 34mm that this is all you get, I don't think so. No way am I paying 38 dollars for 2 dollars worth of plastic. Get ready energy, cause it's coming back!"
1,Mormon and Pychic based program,"I was shocked to find out that this program is filled with Mormon theology. It is based on such theories as Suggestology, which is listed under Pychic studies in Amazon search. This is just not a program that I think any child or adult should expose themselves to.Here is a list of the other theories this method is based on and where the information can be found:Suggestopedy by LoranovTotal Physical Response by AsherSilent Way by GattengoComprehension Approach by Krashen*As described in Dr. Blair's book Innovative Approaches to Language Teaching."
1,One of the best all time records from an underrated band.,"Stuart Adamson was right all along. The reviewers here pointing how the lyrics are paranoid and wrong are brainwashed by corporate media. The Flame of the West was with us here in the 80's. America saw him return here in the 2000's for eight loooonnnggg years. And look at us now.Sad economy, loss of jobs and the demise of the decent middle working class. If there is anytime for this gem to be revived, it is now. I rated this release a 5, but be forewarned, the sound on this remaster is ugly and we hope for a re-release soon.EDITSo still in 2012 no remaster, the Crossing gets a re-release, they hire a different singer and they go karaoke now. Very sad. My opinion is that the management has always stifled Big Country, that is clearly evident now. Great band but I'm putting Big Country at the back of my collection till this album gets fixed."
5,One of the Best,"This is one of the best rock albums I've ever heard. You should buy it. If you like U2 and comparable music, you should love this album. It has great emotion, great lyrics, and great compassion for struggling humanity."
1,"Landmark Album, Terrible Remaster","I waited along time to find a remaster of this record, one of my all-time favorites. The original, while weak in volume, certainly trumps the sound quality on this. They corrected the volume, but the lack of clarity is unacceptable, especially for something calling itself a ""remaster"". Very disappointed."
3,Publisher's Shame,"I bought this book because I wanted an updated copy. On the front cover in a big black circle it says ""New"" & The best keeps getting better. Well when I got home I looked at my original copy which was from the late 60's or early 70's and compared it to the ""New"" edition. It was the same exact thing. Didn't think something around 40 years old could be considered new. Shameful cover advertising."
2,Unnecessary,"I purchased this when I bought the new translation of the Brothers K by Pevear and Volkhonsky. The book turned out to be much easier to follow, both plotwise and thematically than I had expected and used this crib sheet only at the very beginning. It isn't necessary to an understanding of this great novel."
5,Fun little recipe book!,Fun little recipe book. Never imagined all the uses for a tortilla! Would buy again! The author has quite an imagination.
1,Great and easy recipies and easy to follow.,My daughter uses this book quite often. They have good recipies and easy to follow. It is a hit with the family.
1,very disappointed,It was not at all what I thought it was going to be. It's the size of a cd...not a cookbook
2,DON'T KNOW,I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO TRY ANYTHING YET.. I JUST GOT IT AND I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO PUT IT TO USE YET
3,Intyeresting ideas for tortilla's,"Many ideas to use tortilla's and although I'm sure they all taste good to someone, most tend to lay on the fringes of my likes."
5,tortillas: the edible canvas,"Stephanie Ashcraft is someone who understands how to unlock the potential of the tortilla. Though this delicacy has long been recognized as a favorite by mid-century minimalists such as Yves Klein and Josef Albers, Ashcraft proves the tortilla is a relevant medium for contemporary art as well. Her stirring arrangements of lettuce and shredded cheese display a keen sensitivity to color and emotion, and establish her as the unrivalled queen of postmodern cookery.Also, she demonstrates out that the tortilla can be used as a frisbee, a parachute for small pets, and--with a little creative hole-punching--a terrifying face-mask! The possibilities are truly endless."
3,Incorrect advertising,"This book is advertised that it would be a good cookbook to go along with the tortilla shell pans that I ordered. It doesn't, as it's all regular and roll-up type tortilla recipes."
2,Not what I hoped for,"It can open a bottle, but takes a lot of work. The lip on the opener is not large enough, causing it to take 5-10 attempts to get the cap off. Still look for a real bottle opener even though I have one on my keychain now."
1,FAKE,This is NOT a brand name Brewzkey bottle opener. It's a cheap knockoff. Different shape without the logo. I would know because I already have purchased two of them before as gifts. Very disappointed.
2,"Very Durable, but not very functional","I ordered this one after my third aluminum keychain opener ate itself to death. This one is definitely much more durable, however the bottle notch is poorly formed. The pivot point is positioned too far away from the tooth and doesn't hit anywhere near the center on a typical bottle cap. The tooth is also too small, so it often fails to catch on the lip on the first few tries.It is hard enough to work with that you actually have to practice in order to be able to open bottles. I find if I hand my keys to someone to open a bottle at a party, they usually give up after 3 or 4 tries and I have to open it for them."
3,TSA just took it,"I'm sitting at the gate at Dulles Airport. The TSA just took mine saying it was ""serrated."" I assume all keys are, and I complained on the TSA website. The brewsky works fine, and I carry it everywhere. But after this experience and the lack of free shipping, I will probably replace it with a different model."
3,Works In A Pinch,Most of the reviews on this thing are super long for some reason. Thought I'd give a more concise version.PROS: Solidly built. Conversation starter.CONS: Doesn't work nearly as well as a conventional bottle opener.BOTTOM LINE: Skip this product.
2,Not an actual Brewzkey,"Key Bottle OpenerThe item shipped to me is not a branded Brewzkey. It is sturdy, well constructed, hard, stainless steel. The bottom edges are not beveled like the brewzkey, simply rounded. It takes at least two attempts at different angles to pry to open a bottle -- the angle on the opening apparatus seems a bit too open. I do not know if an actual name brand brewzkey would function any better. I'd like to think that it wouldn't, if only because it means that I wasn't totally screwed over."
2,Large and doesn't work well,"This resembles a key but it's larger than most keys. I though that that was so it would work better, but turns out the size didn't matter. It takes several tries to open a bottle. Still better than opening a bottle with actual keys (as I've had to do on occasion), but not that great a product."
3,Small yet effective,"This is a decent idea for a bottle opener, and well implemented. Doesn't take up too much space on a keychain (it's about the width of a house key) and allows you to have bottle opening functionality wherever you go without bulkier alternatives. Rather cheap in cost, nice workmanship on the item, and the packaging was fine. Would definately reccomend it's use, and it might be a good cheap gift for someone.EDIT: after some more serious use, it is a bit tricky to get it to work on the first try. this should definately be a backup and not a primary bottle opener for whoever gets one of these."
3,Works great. Not the same as picture,"Received the item and it pops open a bottle pretty well for the size. I was disappointed that the item received does not match the picture. The image appears more key like with beveled edges and a logo, but the item I received was larger, and very ""raw"". Appears to have been stamped and shipped without any additional cleanup."
4,Do the job,"Do the job well, it's not too thick or too thin, the size is as expected, why I don't give a 5 star? because I saw a friend a bottle opener better designed than this one but it was a promotional item of clothing brand."
4,Pretty cool,Pros:*Blends in with the rest of your keys*Works pretty good*ConvenientCons:*It doesn't quite latch on perfectly. They should have notched it a little deeper on the lip so it would get a better grip under the bottle cap.*The opener is in the middle of the key so it's leverage isn't as good as it could be either.
4,Concept is great,"The concept of the key is great! It fits so nicely on my key ring and I am always the first to offer an opener when a sober friend is in need of help. However, the key is just a bit too narrow to really grab onto the bottle cap. It takes an attempt or two to get the cap off, but ultimately does its job. Perfect for a compact, once-in-a-while opener but I wouldn't go opening bottles with it all the time."
2,Not easy to use - but looks cool,"I bought one for my bf at the time, one for me. We both thought it looked awesome because it blended in with our other keys. alas, it is just about the worst bottle opener I've ever tried to use. The bottom part doesn't get a good hold of the cap of whatever you're trying to open, and then you start hurting yourself and it's just really inconvenient. usually it takes me 2-3 tries on different sections of the bottle cap to really get to my beer or whatever it is I'm drinking. but aesthetically it's awesome - I'll give it that."
4,Works great.,"The bottle opener works perfectly, and is relatively small. Opening bottles is incredibly easy, and it's nice to always have an opener on me at all times."
1,Barely works,"Requires careful alignment of tooth to flute on beer cap, even then slips off 7 out of 10 tries. Most bottle caps are crimped on tight enough that you cannot catch the edge of the cap to even get started. If you are lucky enough to grab the edge of the cap, the fulcrum of the brewskey will dent the cap to the point of puncturing it. The whole operation requires a lot of force since this opener has no leverage at all. Hey, a church key is the simplest tool in existence, and to make a crappy one is simply unforgivable! You would do better with an old, rusty Boy Scout knife, since they all had a bottle opener blade!"
1,Brewzkey Bottle Opener,"If I could, I would give this bottle opener zero stars. It doesn't work, at all, with any size bottle cap. It just doesn't get underneath the cap, the hook is to small and not long enough. Also, they must have started getting them mass produced or changed manufacturer because it didn't even come with the logo that they are shown with. Completely useless and only takes up space in your keychain."
2,not the best,"This bottle opener is too thin and doesn't work really good. sorry, but for the price what do you expect"
3,last resort,It gets the job done but it cuts into your finger when you use it so after a couple of bottle there will be a mark maybe even a cut. Basically like pressing down on butter knife pretty hard. It does get the job done but unless there isn't any other alternative I won't use it.
5,"Awesome product! Great idea, Great Quality","I bought this after searching for a gift to get a 21 year old guy. I had a few ideas in mind but I bought this with a 6 pack! It's great quality! The only noticeable difference between this key and other keys is that this key is bigger but if you are just glancing you would never know that this was not an ordinary key! Huge idea, small package, great gift! I am so excited for him to get it! It's a clever little gift! This from now on will be a staple gift for anyone turning 21! :) Very pleased and you cannot beat the price!Edit: I talked to the person I bought this for recently and he is constantly getting asked where he got it. He loves it and so does everyone else! Thanks Brewskey for the incredibly nifty gift!"
1,Flimfsy Junk,"I purchased this out of convenience from amazon. I am a Prime member, so I get it within 2 days. The bottle opener is total junk. It's super thin and fails to grip bottle caps efficiently."
1,not funny or functional,"I bought this because I liked the ""Brewzkey"" joke, and I needed a new bottle opener. But it doesn't have the logo that it has in the picture; instead it's a monkey head (with no tag-line). And it doesn't have the leverage to open bottles well; it takes a few starts to get the cap off."
3,"Works in a pinch, but isn't the best beer opener","I got this because I lost my previous key chain bottle opener. My old one had a greater surface area and was easier to open bottles with. This takes a few tries, but eventually gets it. The good thing is that it's not bulky on your key chain."
3,Nice low profile opener,"I bought this because I like the idea of a bottle opener disguised on my key chain. It's not the best opener -- it usually takes more than 1 shot to get the cap off. But it works, and that's all I care about."
5,This book has helped me in many ways,"Luanne Oakes is an amazing writer with original ideas. As you apply these techniques you will notice a subtle shift. I personally feel more balanced,things that used to fluster me just don't anymore. I highly suggest purchasing Luanne's Sound Health Sound Wealth CD program. It's a great addition to this wonderful book!"
5,Sound advice for energictically healing yourself,One of THE BEST books I've read on sound and energetic healing.... and I have a HUGE library of integrative healing books! I enjoy the CD often... especially in the evening.
4,Great awareness!,"This book opens your eyes and mind, it provides a stucture that works and few people actually do, it's like a road map to success or even like a treasure map!"
2,Sound Health Sound Wealth,"This book is another self-help book. I enjoyed the book HOWEVER, IT LOST SOME CREDIBILITY WHEN I read the last sentenced, in the first paragraph of page 171 of Chapter Six, The Principle of Sound and Light. It reads:""In the physical world of matter, Sound precedes Light, as we know from hearing the thunder before we see the lightning in a storm. *****Maybe, I am confused, but, I see lightning FIRST and start the ONE ONE THOUSAND count down to hear the thunder and determine how far away the storm is."
5,"An unbelievable resource for spirit, life, balance, and peace","It seems that every few years i come upon a book that is truly extraordinary. A book that stands out over the other ones i've been giving my time to. Ms. Oak's Sound Health/Sound Wealth book exceeds the truly extraordinary. This book has helped me to balance my life. I feel as though since reading the book, absorbing the clear descriptive distinctions it makes regarding my body, my life, and the world i live in, and breathing in its teachings and offerings, i have been living in true health and balance. i recommend this book FOR EVERYONE. it isn't some wishy washy elusive rambling, it is a scientific, clear and inspiring offering from an unbelievably wonderful author and person. Her use of language to clarify the most grand and microscopic aspects of self and life and priceless. click the buttons that lead this book to arriving at your door."
5,Why Didn't I Think of That?,"After wrestling one too many greasy fowl out of the oven with makeshift tongs and prongs, I finally decided to get this tool. At first, I was hesitant to make this purchase since I didn't see how such a simple instrument could wrangle a roast holiday bird. But wrangle it did! The simple hook design provides ample leverage for even a 20-pound butterball and the rubber grip ensures a steady grasp. Never again shall I be scalded by boiling goose fat."
5,Mystery gift,My mother reports that this works beautifully. It also makes a great mystery gift (without its packaging). Ask people to guess what it is. the answers will be hilariously varied.
1,horrible styling,"collar is too big, the length is too long and fit is very loose,not what I was expecting. from the photo it looks different."
5,Columbia Fleece Vest,This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them. I would recommend this vest to anyone. I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties. Looks sharp.
2,A disappointment...,"I've worn Columbia fleece for years, and their vests are a particular favorite because they are so versatile. I've loved the quality and the details in the design. However, this Cathedral vest falls woefully short in both those categories. First of all, there is NO DRAWSTRING at the bottom, and that is an essential for the fit and warmth of a vest...the bottom just hangs open and the drape of the garment just doesn't work without that simple elastic drawstring. Further, the workmanship isn't any better than the no-name brands available for half the price, and the material is thin and insufficient. Not up to Columbia's very high (and usual) standard. Wish I could get my money back. Try again, Amazon."
5,Well made and fits perfectly.,Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable.
3,Weird fit,Had to return. Seemed to be a slim cut. Bought for husband in Large. He has several Large vests by Columbia but this Large had to be returned. It looked like a ladies cut.
1,Very thin material,We've purchased a number of these vest over the past few years and we actually had to return this one because the quality of the material was so poor. It was very thin and flimsy. The collar wouldn't stand up as it should because the material was so thin. Very dissapointed.
5,Exactly what I wanted,"Quick service, good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month. Considering ordering another in a different color."
4,"Comfortable, soft, lightweight","Fleece is fleece, but this vest is surprisingly well put-together. The only thing is it missing is a third pocket (the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have)."
3,"Columbia Sportwear Men's Cathedral Peak Vest, Gypsy","I probably would never purchase this product online again. The material was not what I expected. I found the same product, the same price at the Marcy and the material is much better and thicker."
4,Comfortable vest,The vest is comfortable and is made well. The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars. The vest runs on the large side. If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear. It would be better with an elastic draw string too.
2,"Runs a size big, poor stitching","This is the sleeveless version of the Steen's Mountain jacket. Runs a size big (5'7"" 160 lbs, small was loose). No drawcord in hem is less than stellar. Useless against wind. I'm having to edit my review because the stitching is coming loose around the bottom of the zipper. It's not only fraying, it's also interfering with the zipper operation. I hope Amazon will take it back."
2,not warm,"bought this vest to supplement a Patagonia fleece vest i have. To my surprise the vest is not very warm, does not feel like i have a fleece vest on! Otherwise the fleece has a nice material and nice look to it but it is not doing what it is supposed to (keep me warm) & also as others have mentioned in the posts here it runs a size larger (i bought an L but should have gotten an M - for all my other stuff i have Ls)Hope this helps."
2,Vest Review,The vest did not meet my expectations. The quality of the fleece was not what I expected. I expected a thicker fleece. It is very hard buying some things online without details of the construction of the item. Thanks Scott
3,not as good as I hoped,"it was for my husband and he thinks it looks cheap, definitely not to keep you warm, I thought Columbia was a good brand."
4,Cozy vest,Lightweight. I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night. Layers well. Added a drawstring at the waist. Easy to do but would have preferred it was included.
5,"Great Service, Easy to deal with","Dumb me, I ordered the wrong size. No problem with this purchase. It was easy to return and reorder the correct size. Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back. This firm is ""On he Ball"" when it comes to handling a situation like this."
4,comfortable and nice looking,"While I don't get too excited by clothing, and this is no exception, I do find this is a well made, comfortably warm vest, that I am glad I purchased."
3,Columbia Vest,"This vest was so thin that by holding it up to the light you could see through it. A large size which I usually wear was way to big--should have gotten a medium. Rather than returning it, I gave it to a friend who likes it and wears it all the time. I ended up buying a Lands End Polartec vest which I like a lot better than the Columbia."
3,Gift,I bought it as a gift so it is hard to review it. It looks great and warm. I'm sure he will love it.
4,Good vest,"I bought this for my husband last year, for Christmas. At this point in time, no complaints at all from him. Washes well and wears well, and its light color doesn't show white dog hair, which was a must for a new vest!"
3,good item,I bought this vest for my father in an XXL size and it was WAY too large for him. The fabric is a lot thinner than I expected.
5,Very Pleased!,"I ordered several of these in different colors. The quality is great and the sizing is true. Furthermore, they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time. If additional colors become available, I won't hesitate to order more."
5,Colunbia Vest,"Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas. Beautiful red shade, and fits extremely well. He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition."
5,"Perfect fit, well made product","Like all Columbia products, this item arrived true to fit and size. I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time. It washes well and is very durable. We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new."
3,"Good quality, but no drawstring on hem","I like the quality of the vest, and have always been pleased with Columbia products. The problem is the description says drawstring along the hem and it does not have a drawstring. I'm a 5' 11"", 'trim' build and the Medium vest fits fine in the shoulders, but is too, too large in the waist. I have a 31"" waist and it's better suited to a 34""-36"" waist. If you like a loose fit around your waist or have a bit of a paunch then it should be fine."
1,No drawstring!,There was no drawstring to cinch the waistline as was stated in the description. Very unhappy with this purchase! Boo!
5,Monkeephile,"I own as many LP's as I can. Yes, I said LP so that will date me. Barring paying close to $170 for the actual CD version, this is the Best option to hear how the Monkees developed the best album put out in the their name. Yes, it is repetitive. Yes, you will hear songs you've heard before. But - if you are a true Monkees fan, you will appreciate the glimpses into the recording of their best album. Is this a value for someone not familiar with the Monkees? No. Is this perfect for the Monkees fan who wants a glimpse into the recording process? Absolutely! I wouldn't pass up the chance to hear the group in the studio."
1,how old is this material?,"This book seems very dated & a bit sexist. It has a strong underlying message of ""being a bridesmaid will get you a man of your own."" The excerpts on The Knot's website are funny, but the book as a whole is rather pathetic."
4,Humorous and Helpful,"As the author of [...] I thought that this book was humorous and helpful. I read it before my first ""tour of duty"" as a 20 year-old maid of honor and no idea what I was doing. I made it through the experience alive and have occasionally referenced this book in my many, many tours of duty since. What was most helpful in my situation was the tactful tips on how to handle unhelpful bridesmaids."
5,God Send,This book is awesome! A must read for anyone who has been asked to be a bridesmaid. I have recently been asked to be the Maid of Honor in a friends wedding and really had no idea where to start. I got the book on Friday and by Monday I had already called the Bride and Bridesmaids to discuss everything from the shoes to the bachelorette party...I was so lost without it!
1,Outdated Emily Post,"I thought this book would be a fun gift for my bridesmaids. I bought one copy and realized that it was more of an instructional manual with tips on where bridesmaid's stand in the processional etc. (information we will cover at the wedding rehersal).Other tips include a shower game called ""The Clothespin Game,"" which is so outdated my grandmother must've played it at showers when she was young. Mrs. Cleaver or Aunt Bee would be perfect hostesses for this type of game. I can't see anyone born post 1940 being entertained.Overall this book reads like an outdated Emily Post primer filled with information which is obvious. The title is cute, and had me expecting the book to be cute. The attempt at engaging the reader consists of a series of ""war"" metaphors. I thought this book would bore my bridesmaids, so I chose not to give it."
2,Helpful but feeds the beasts,"The bridesmaid's only real duty is to stand up for her friend who is getting married. NO ONE is ""obligated"" to hold a shower, since these are a gift to a bride, not something she is entitled to have and absolutely must get.A bridesmaid with sense should ask up front if she has to pay for her own dress, shoes, hair, etc, and a considerate bride will tell her anyway. Only a bridezilla would give this to her maids and say ""this is your job. Do it.""I suggest Bridezilla or a visit to the etiquettehell dot com site for real, free instructions on what one's polite duty is to the bride, and what a considerate bride's responsibilities are to her maids."
5,Memoir of experiences,"This memoir is written by someone who lived the 1930's development to war and other significant societal changes right up to the 1960's shift in conciousness. It is to her credit the effort to encompass her own development in a memoir while staying completely focused on the topic of extra-sensory perception in her experience. British, worldy experience, authentic in the sense of being a real person but not always a kind person.I ordered the book based on author Sonia Choquette reference in another book. I expected it to be a throw-away, sort of lah-lah-lah ain't it great to be psychic. But I'll end up reading it twice before donating to the used book store."
2,The Complete Guide to Horse Care,"Not a book for the beginner. Used too many terms without giving any reference. I had to refer to other books just to find out what the author was talking about. Alot of medical, longwinded jargon that isn't useful in real life when a simplified, straight-forward description would suffice. If you have a horse and you want to learn how to take care of your charge I would not recommend this book to do it. Great book for a medical student."
4,You May Have Missed This One!,"This album was originally released back in the early '80s, but it never received the attention it deserved. After Gary released this he went on tour in support of Def Leppard on the Pyromania tour. Although he was able to play in front of huge audiences this album never did ""take off"", and it's a shame because this was a great release.The intro to the song End Of The World featured a terrific instrumental piece that would please any shred fan, and this was before shred became popular. Don't Take Me For A Loser was a very good ""rocker"". The album contained two ballads (Always Gonna Love You and Falling In Love With You) that if they had been relaesed they would have been #1 hits, and they would have sent this album soaring up the charts. If you like great guitar playing and good ""melodic"" harder rock songs pick this one up. You won't be disappointed!!"
5,Moore Rocks!,"Gary Moore rocks out on this album which originally came out in 1982. I love this remastered version with the 3 bonus tracks. All together you get 3 versions of the song ""Falling In Love With You"" which is a great rock ballad;I especially love the instrumental version where the singing is replaced by excellent guitar solos. Gary's guitar playing is top notch throughout the album. The guitar work at the beginning of ""The End of the World"" is blistering. This song also features Jack Bruce from Cream on lead vocals.Another familiar name apearing on the album is Ian Paice of Deep Purple who plays the drums. This is cd is one of Moore's better ones,right up there with his other 1980's hard rocking cds."
3,Uneven album that has some outstanding guitar solos.,"I have been searching for this cd for years. Gary Moore plays one of the greatest solos in rock history on ""End of the World"" plus the vocals are performed by Jack Bruce from Cream. This song alone makes the cd worth buying. ""Rockin every Night"" is also a good tune but the rest of the cd is filled with blues and r&b songs that Moore went on to play in his later work. This cd is neccesary for any early-mid 80's hard rock fan."
4,Powerful.,"Gary Moore teamed up with Deep Purple drummer extraordinaire Ian Paice and legends Neil Murray and Jack Bruce for this 1982 set of metal guitar pyrotechnics augmented by well written songs and a soulful vocal delivery.Gary shines all over this album,of course,but what really stands out here is Ian Paice's authoritative drumming which,again translates into kudos to Moore for having the inspiration to surround himself with such prime talent.A classic collector's item."
3,or maybe 3.5...,"""Corridors of power"" is without doubt the best heavy metal album by Gary Moore. It's melodic but still energetic. The material is strong and many of the songs get stuck in your head, like ""Don't take me for a loser"" and ""Cold hearted"". The main problem with Gary Moore is his ability to sing. Of course it's not out of tune but his voice are far from the better in the genre.The follow up album ""Victims of the future"" is a weaker copy of this one. After that Moore's song writing would never reached the same heights with the exception of a song here and there (like ""Run for cover"" and ""Over the hills and far away""). As we all know he finally abandoned heavy metal and decided to go for the blues."
3,Corridors of Something less than maximum power...,"For me, a Corridors review boils down to a couple things. Overall, the metal here is maybe a little above average, not great, 80's metal. And for the most part, what you've really got is just a slew of metally love songs. I guess GM was going through one of those periods, but this CD devotes way too much to it. Even with the bonus tracks, all three are love songs, even the new title. To me, this adds insult to injury by no less than doubling the number of love songs--when there were already too many to begin with. And we're not talking something really good, like ""Love Drive"" (Scorpions), or even ""Hold On To Love"" (GM-Victims Of The Future). In the end, the tracks don't do much for either their topic or genre. It's about a 2 1/2 star CD, I'd say. Get GM's Victims Of The Future for some of the very best 80's metal you will ever hear."
2,"Alright, if you have no other choice","This book was published in 1971, and is very proud of ""modern"" archery technology -- while this makes it a funny read, it's not really very useful anymore. The author skims over all the necessary subjects, giving them mention and a very brief explanation, without going into any of the necessary depth. You will learn from this book if you know nothing of archery, but if you've already shot a bow, and know what the nock point is, try for a less condescending book. It does have groovy pictures of archers with bellbottoms, though."
2,Great music - corrupted MP3 file,"I was very intrigued when I read about this album and listened to excerpts on NPR's website that I bought it from Amazon's MP3 store. I thoroughly enjoy the album, but am very disappointed that one track, Disillusioned, cuts off before the end of the song. I re-downloaded the album, hoping that the problem occurred when it was transfered to my computer... but the problem was still there. I even listened to it on my 'Amazon Cloud Player' -- still has the same problem.If folks would like to buy this album, I would recommend that they purchase the CD instead of downloading it from Amazon. (Unless you don't mind an abrupt and premature ending to one song.)"
5,My Favorite Christian Reggae CD!,"Youth Exodus is the best Christian Reggae band I've ever heard. A fan of Reggae music, over the years, I have yet to hear anything put out by a Christian band that I truly enjoy listening to again and again. I've had this CD for a few years, and still find myself pulling it out from time to time. It's too bad they never made any additional recordings (that I know of). The sound quality is a little on the crude side, but is more than compensated for in talent, both in the songwriting and performance. I highly recomend this CD to anyone who loves both the Lord Jesus Christ and Reggae music!!"
2,Stupid movie,A very good looking woman who is also a deer kills men. Thats is it. We never see her kill them only what is left of them after she does. That is it. My problem with this and all these Masters of Horror movies are that they are only a hour long. It is hard to get a good story line going in one hour.
1,Embarrassingly awful brain-dead installment of otherwise Great Show,"Do NOT judge the Masters of Horror series by this lame and pointless episode--and if you are a fan, please skip it! The story yielded neither surprise nor insight, the dialogue and acting were clunky and the attempts at humor were astoundingly atrocious. Check out Lucky McKee's Sick Girl. Now that's a masterful blend of absurd horror and humor!"
1,Dangle Heart Ring,The O ring that holds the charm on has already broken off and is now unwearable and the charm was lost when this happened since I didn't know when or where it happened. I really liked it until this happened. It really didn't seem that fragile.
4,Very expensive but worth it,"Like most of the songs on this album. It may be a bit pricey for some, but it is so rare that's to be expected.""Square Rooms"" is excellent. Wish the extended version were on this album.A good place to listen to a few Al Corley tracks is imeem (free - some songs may require registration, but again, won't cost you anything).If you aren't into the 1980s music these days, you probably won't bother with this genre. (I don't care for most of today's 'new' music.)"
1,Not What I expected,"I expected this to be a walkthrough for people like myself who have a knowledge of physics but are far from being experts and are interested in reading the classics of science. This is a guide for the modern Professor of Physics, not a guide for the common reader as it says. If I had known that I wouldn't have bought it. I get the impression that there is certainly a demand for such a walkthrough. I thought this would be it.A BIG disapointment!"
5,Uncommon price for a book intended for common reader,"I have not read this book, but would love too. But the price is just too high for a book that is intended for the common reader. It is unaffordable for the common reader.(NOTE: My stars rating is meaningless because I have not read the book.)"
4,"Good trays, just don't overfill","I agree with a couple of the other reviewers - just don't overfill these trays and they are golden. When filling, use the notches throughout the center of the trays as max-fill markers. This will ensure the lid doesn't get ""sealed"" to the base of the tray when put in the freezer.The lids were a little tight putting on the first time, but after the first freeze, they slid easily and effortlessly. Only knock might be the width. I don't have a problem with it yet, but they are wider than my other trays, which could cause a problem depending on the freezer.Overall, I like them, the cubes come out a nice size for any glass, the lids prevent the trays from sticking to one another and it's easy to get the ice cubes out."
1,Garbage,"I couldn't agree more with the other negative reviews on this site. The depressions for the cubes are too small, resulting in the need to fill the trays to the top to get decent-sized cubes, and when you do so, the water runs everywhere and the lid freezes to the tray, making the tray frustratingly difficult to open. These trays are actually less functional and harder to use than the cheap plastic ones you can buy everywhere for under a dollar."
2,"Don't buy now, needs some work","I had seen this in a magazine stating that it was a great product so I trusted and bought this because it looked so cool and is a great concept; unfortunately it needs some work. The good part is you don't have to fill each individual cube, you can just pour water in and it flows to the right part. The pushing each cube out sounds great but because ice expands and the bottom is flexible it gets stuck and you really can't get the cube out unless you let it melt a little before. The cube size is neat because it's oval but they are a little big for my taste. I would wait a while and see if they make improvements on the design, hopefully someday."
2,Buy if you like to water down your drinks.,"OXO normally makes wonderful products that feel solid, and this cheap plastic tray disappoints.I haven't had as many issues opening/closing the lid like others. However, i have to state something I feel is more aggravating- I hate putting the ""cubes"" in my drink and immediately hearing the ice crack, and then have it virtually disappear in a few minutes. The ""cubes"" have a very large surface area to volume, which is responsible for this.Instead I purchased Tovolo ice trays which offer real cubes, and ones with larger sizes that melt slower. The cubes keep their form, don't immediately dissolve, and still cooling a drink while providing a small desirable amount of dilution.I guess it depends on what you want from your ice... not for me."
4,Peg,"Wow!!! I expected these to be so terrible...I had heard that the people at Cooks Illustrated (a great cooking magazine used them in their test kitchens)so I knew they couldn't be that bad. I ordered three trays,they work just fine.You don't spill the water out of these when filling any more then a tray without a lid.After frozen the lid slides off just fine.So have no fear if you decide to purchase.Four stars not five because after all it is just an ice cube tray."
2,Annoying piece of plastic,"Instead of a typical review, I urge you to read the one submitted by Blake Scholl above. He said basically everything that I was going to, and I feel it's a 100% accurate account of the product.I love OXO, but this ice cube tray is a pain in the arse. Its only redeeming quality is the fact that I can stack things on top of it because it is covered."
2,"Good idea, poor execution","I purchased these trays because I liked the idea of the lid to make extracting the ice cubes easier. While the extraction is, indeed, quite easy, the mess I've made every time I've attempted to fill them has made them useless.The cubes themselves are rather shallow, and there little to no wall outside of the filling area. Water does not flow well from one cube to the next, instead spilling over the side. Most frustrating to me is the fact that the entire tray is somewhat convex in shape, so balancing it horizontally to prevent spilling is next to impossible; if one portion of the tray is horizontal, another portion will be at enough of an angle to pour its contents to the floor.I would definitely not recommend these to a friend, unless, perhaps, that friend has a particularly dirty kitchen floor that might benefit from an occasional soak."
2,A poor wannabe,"I have four covered trays made by Tupperware, I was trying to save a buck, bought four of these because I have liked other Oxo products. It was a mistake. While these work, the cubes are small, the trays are difficult to fill and cap without spilling water, and they are clunky in the freezer compartment. All I did was compromise, buy and waste my money, and now I need to go pay the full price for the Tupperware trays that work and that I should have bought to start with."
1,Good concept poor design,"The idea of covering ice cubes so that they don't evaporate (a problem in frostless refrigerator/freezers) and don't pick up strange odors is a good one. However, the cube trays in Oxo's design are too shallow and the lid is very rigid. The lid does not slide closed at the outset and once frozen it doesn't slide open. It's a struggle to try to slide or clamp the lid onto the tray a good bit of water spills. After one use in the freezer, the lid seems to have warped a bit so that I have to force it as flat as I can while lining up the lid with the tray."
2,Chilly Fit,I really wanted to like this product. It seemed like a good idea. You fill it full of water and slide the cover over and place it in the freezer. No it wasn't that easy. The cover is to snug and is jerky when closing and even more difficult when frozen. The ice that comes out is okay but no where big enough. I have a drawer freezer so placing the tray full of water always spills (no the lid is not water tight) This was a great idea just poorly executed. I would not recommend this product.
4,does what i needed,"i got this item for freezing baby food in just right portions while keeping them freezer burn free. i have had this product now for over a month and am extremely satisfied with it. the tray is easily bendable to pop the food cubes out. it does an excellent job keeping freezer burn out up to about three weeks, which i usually pop them out by then anyway and store in ziploc freezer bags. i have no complaints really from this product other than the lid can sometimes be hard to maneuver on and off, although i think that is b/c i am using them to freeze food and not ice."
1,"Water, Water Everywhere!! I wanted to rate it 0 stars....",I couldn't hate this product more. There is no way to fill tray or close the lid without sloshing water everywhere. Then the very short trip to the fridge usually results in more dripping.1. Make the lid watertight2. Make the lid removable by either sliding or popping off if the slide area is obstructed.3. Do something about that weird slant the trays have that doesn't allow the water to flow smoothly between cube spaces as you fill it. Usually resulting in overflow & spillage from the spaces you've already filled.
3,Not as good as expected,"I found the lids are challenging to put on and take off. When the trays are frozen, the lids are even more challenging! I would have preferred snap on lids vs the slider type."
2,"Nice cubes, useless cover",They didn't design the cover well enough so the ice would not lock it. So in general you'll always have to fight to get your ice.
2,Make my ice!,This ice cube tray make fantastic ice. Be carefull with the slider as it may get frozen to the tray.
4,ice trays,I love the size of the cubes but it is inconvenient to have to stop and slide the tops back. Wish I had ordered a differend kind.
1,Worst Ice Cube Trays Ever!,"I'm a huge fan of OXO, and own lots of their utensils, but these are terrible. The cube ports do not have a lip, so water spills constantly on the trip from the counter to the freezer (even if you fill well below the rim, which results in a very small cube). The plastic cover, supposedly designed to keep out odors, leaves a gap all the way around the tray, making it easy for odors to penetrate the cubes (and adding to the spilled water annoyance). Don't waste your money; you will only be frustrated."
2,Great idea but flawed,Although the idea of these ice cube trays is great the actual use and operation of them is not. They can be very difficult to open up after they have frozen your ice cubes. Needless to say that is frustrating and it ends up making a mess all over with pieces of chipped ice and so on. The internal surface of the lid sticks to the ice cubes making opening up the tray very difficult if not impossible and leads to frustration and a mess in general.I would not recommend these to my friends or family.
3,bulky and expensive,This thing is pretty bulky and really not much better than the covered ice cube trays that my local dollar store sells.
1,OXO Ice Cube Tray,"Total piece of crap. At $9:00 when I bought it in June of '12 it was defective. Now, for a dollar more, and an month later, OXO has fixed the product after discovering how bad the first version sucked. Last OXO product I'll ever buy. Is all their stuff impulsively designed, produced, sold and then improved based on the failure of the first version? Don't buy this thing. If you do, you'll be sorry. OXO says, ""DirectionsTo Fill: Remove lid and fill tray with water. Place tray on countertop, and steady tray with one hand while sliding the lid back on. To Release: Twist tray to loosen ice cubes. To dispense cubes, slide lid until the desired number of cubes are fully exposed. Turn tray over to release cubes."" They can't even tell the truth when their write about the crap they make!"
4,No Spills and easily tucks under this and that,Easy to fillEasy to release iceand tucks neatly underor on top of whatever is in the freezer.
2,Terrible covers,"Covers don't slide on or off easily, so you end up with water all over your floor. Thanks OXO!!! Nice job."
1,I hate these,"They drip water on the way to the freezer from the sink, the cubes are small, they are hard to open when frozen."
1,Very disappointed,"When I first saw these tray I bought them IMMEDIATELY! I was so excited because this is a great way to keep things out of the water while it's freezing. I thought this was a fabulous idea.But the covers are difficult to get on and off. When you pull them off theyre stuck at first, so you pull harder, then I usually end up with a fast jerk, causing the water to spill everywhere, or cubes to fall out.The cube shapes themselves are half moons, so the water just falls out of them so easily and all over the floorEVERYDAY when I refill the trays with water and put the covers on I end up having to wipe water off the floor.I ended up throwing them away and getting normal deep cubed tray.This is an EXCELLENT idea, but I think they need to go back to the drawing board with this one.I hope they do because I'd love to buy an improved version."
2,Not as I thought,"These trays are not spillproof. I guess it doesn't say that in the advertisement but I assumed since they had lids that they would be spillproof. I guess I assumed incorrectly. Also, they are larger than regular trays so they did not fit into my freezer space as I had planned."
2,Inferior Product,"I bought these mainly because I was hoping they would be easy to stack in my freezer. They don't stack any better than regular trays. The tray is shaped in such a way that all extra water flows off the tray and onto the floor; rather than most trays where the extra water flows into the next cube.I've actually taken to filling the trays in the freezer with my brita pitcher to avoid carrying the trays across the kitchen. The cover sticks making it very difficult to slide it on without the water falling all over the floor. Once the ice cubes are actually made it performs well. You can serve the ice cubes one by one. But honestly, I'm thinking I'll just go back to regular trays."
1,Piece of Junk,Excellent concept but bad execution. The cover is hard to take out once the ice hardened. I dont believe on the quality of all products made by OXO from now on.
4,The perfect time,"Wave of emotion is a perfect mix between the heart and the brain , is a masterpiece , the sound , the tones, the music is perfect.Richie guitar play mode is a particular and strange .Is one of the best guitar player around the world.Sit down and listen !"
2,A bit too funky for my tastes,"This album by Kool and the Gang, while not as annoying as their 70s recordings, is still too funky for me. I think they really hit their stride with ""Joanna"", and singer J.T. Taylor took it to a new level with his solo career which he really caps with the amazingly smooth ""Sex on the Beach"". My suggestion: steer clear of the funk and go for the sweet lovemaking music in Mr. Taylor's later work."
3,A nice one,"This was the late 80s/early 90s McShee/Jansch led Pentangle line up which lead to the later (and in my opinion, stronger) release ""So Early In the Spring"". But there is some nice work on this one- I partularly like ""Open the Door"", ""Mother Earth"" and ""Yarrow""- and Bert Jansch's ""A Taste of Love"" has always been a favorite of mine."
5,Steffon is real,THis album take you back to the old school gangsta Rap. Tracks as Frost Bit and uncut funk will take you back to the old days. Steffon Trippin` wit no luggage is a real good album with some good funky tracks. Eazy-e did the production and Rhythm D the instumental and that will say enough. I reccomend this album to every fan off Ruthless Records and Eazy-E.
3,Christmas With Patti Page,"I am looking for a song that goes like, Shake me I rattle, squeeze me I cry, please take me home and love me.It was sung by either Patti Page or Doris Day, back in the 1950's?"
5,Great!,Super BooK! I found here everything I needed!!! Everything! Even the most unknown radio stations!I even found a record store! It doesn't matter where you live because it has everything!
1,Don't bother!,I bought this cd and was very excited about it! When I got the cd it was wrapped up and when I unwrapped it there was no cd in there! I also ordered the club and venue part and that cd wasn't even wrapped up and I was afraid to use it on my computer. It looked like some bootleg cd. I was very unhappy with this purchase!
1,Don't Buy this,When I bought this cooler it came in a box and the part for the cupholder was glue on not properly and i believe it use. don't buy from them.
2,What is on this turtle's head?,"This is a perfectly acceptable baby toy, I guess -- my daughter liked it when she was about six months old and teething -- but it has a penis on its head. I know it's supposed to be a snorkel, but it looks like exactly one thing, and trust me, everybody who sees the toy will notice it immediately. All of the Baby Einstein turtle toys have the same stupid snorkel thing -- our crib mobile has the same problem.I'm not a prude but this is a pretty dumb design for a baby toy. I sure wouldn't buy this as a gift."
3,Advanced practices,"Well, the books not expensive and it reads like, the man that wrote it knows what he is talking about. But the practices he gives you to do are some really advanced practices. I am sure the practices he tells you to do daily. Would produce results, its just that a beginner in concentration exercises would be really hard put, to get anything from the knowledge contained in this book. Jeff"
5,My favorite book in the whole world.,"Any time you spend reading from this book and doing the exercises, no matter how minimal your discipline, will be time well spent."
3,Technical Foundation,"This book is written as a technical overview for the subject of Fire Investigation, this I would reccomend only for seasoned or well knowledged Fire Investigators."
4,Good; notice caution,"I ordered this to use with my 1st grade music class after we did a unit on ""Carnival of the Animals"". Even though much of the humor was over their heads, they really enjoyed Bugs and Daffy's shenanigans and recognized the individual pieces as they were played by the orchestra. My only note of caution is that because in today's language, some formerly innocuous words now have derogatory meanings, I deemed it necessary to skip over the introductory and closing remarks to ""Wild Jackass""."
5,GREAT CD!!,"These songs are so pretty and Reba sounds so pure and unaffected. I listen to this one all the time because its country, pure and simple!! The production values on here are great as well!"
4,"Not your ordinary Reba cd, but still good","This cd is not the frisky Reba we know and love. All the songs are slow, no uptempo songs. But Reba can belt out a ballad like no other. I rate it good!"
4,Sneaky in the best possible way,"I keep waiting for the electronic fans to come out of the woodwork in support of Echoboy, but it doesn't seem to be happening. Well anyway, this album is less tuneful and more ambient than ""Vol. 2"", and just plain better than ""Giraffe.""If you've heard neither, than here's what the album is: psychedelic lo-fi electronic, good for night drives or days spent cleaning your apartment alone (sad, but true). It would probably make you rip your hair out if you were high, since it manages to ease into harsh industrial sounds before you can notice, but in a sober state this is often an unexpected and pleasant surprise. The best thing about this album is that it proves restraint is still an asset in the electronic world. Just because you have everything but the kitchen sink at your disposal doesn't mean you have to throw it all in. Echoboy doesn't insist on grabbing the listener's attention. He just waits for the listener to give it up. That takes guts to do."
1,Buy a silicone brush!!,The bristles definately fall out. I'm tired of having to pick them off of my BBQ'd chicken. I'm in the process of looking for a silicone brush that won't have this problem.
1,It leaves more bristles than marinade,"Run, do not walk, away from this brush. I don't know what type of glue they used to hold the bristles in but it must be the Post-It Note glue."
2,was good.now trash,"This brush was great for awhile on my grilled stuff, as well as on all of my baked items. Unfortunately after about ten washes half of the bristles came out at once! Oy. Don't buy this one unless you don't want something that lasts."
1,ALL the bristles fell out!,"A few months after buying and using this brush, *all* the bristles fell out in one big clump. Yikes!"
1,terrible unless you like boar hair on your basted food,"the bristles come out non-stop. oxo took back my first, sent a replacement, which proceeded to do the same thing. shoddy build on this item, stay away. That said, OXO has great customer service and other products I've used are better."
3,Cheap,"It's decent, gets the job done. It looks and feels cheap. Its probably worth like 5 dollars. Comes with screws. Make sure to drill the right hole size. You may have to guess at it."
2,"Gets too hot, but it works","This enclosure is great except that it does not have any automatic power shutoff and it's passive cooling is in my opinion not enough. I have a 500 GB WD Caviar drive in there running all the time, probably wasting a lot of energy because when my computer goes into standby mode to save power, this drive for some reason continues to run, so it is always fairly warm. I have to physically turn it off at the switch to save power. Maybe I am missing something, but I guess I thought it would be smarter than that. Other than that, it is lightning fast, and it does my full backups (>300 GB) much, much faster than USB hard drive enclosures. As far as speed goes, this is a great model. If I could do it over, I would buy an enclosure with active cooling."
2,"I am woman, hear me slide","I just bought this CD, my first by her, and am somewhat disappointed in it. Well, lets just say I couldn't listen to it anymore this morning after about half of it.The musicianship is excellent. The vocals, though powerful, are so affected that it became unlistenable to me.I can hear that she has her own voice here and there, but to a greater degree she's trying to emulate something, and it gets grating to keep listening to it.I also found the CD titles of all her stuff to be a bit affected too. Is she afraid that someone will forget she's a woman?Gone Woman Blues, I am Every woman (oh puhleeze), Mama's Blues, etc, etc. Makes me wonder if she's jockeying for the Holly Neer Award in the Delta Blues category.If I could find another CD of her's where the vocals come from her heart and not from her marketing plan, I'd buy it."
5,Smouldering Fires,The beginning kept me coming back for the big ending. I would recommend it for anyone.
4,The Gunsmith encounters a mysterious plague.,"Clint Adams arrives at a town that is plagued by a strange disease. The story moves along and The Gunsmith does his best to help. A sub plot developes and turns into an unexpected ending. The ending was just a shade to abrupt, but it still worked. Good book in the terrific Gunsmith series."
4,From the cover:,"From the back of the book:Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the word ""hate"" is being used in society more than ever, argues the author. This book is at once a psychological, theological, and sociological analysis of hate and an argument for moving from hatred to compassion in dealing with others. The author explores the different levels of hate, which he believes range across a continuum, from extremely destructive to constructive patterns of hating. As he discusses how it it possible for hatred to become compassion, he helps the reader understand hate as it operates in ourselves and in others, and he proposes a path to help us move away from violent expressions of hate."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO!,"Jackie plays a henchman of the main bad character, not a lead role at all. This film features Jackie for about 5 minutes, all he does is get beaten up."
1,Horrible,"This is an absolutely horrible movie. It has a very similar plot to ""Rummble in the Bronx"", but this movie has none of the good fights (Jackie Chan barely does any marial arts or stunts at all)that ""Rummble in the Bronx"" has, none of the plot, and really is not a true Jackie Chan film. Also stay away from ""Fanatasy Mission Force"", it is just as bad."
1,A Jackie Chan Movie ??????!!!!!,"This movie is simply a compilation of clips from Spiritual Kung Fu, Shaolin Wooden Men and many more.Lo Wei was very disappointed when Chan left him for Golden Harvest and made this ""movie"" to cash in on Chan's new found stardom. The movie is also known as The Young Tiger."
1,"Save yourself some money, don't buy this film, read below","With the rising success of Jackie Chan this 70s flick aka police woman was re-released with the title rumble in hong kong, trying to cash in on the success of rumble in the bronx. On the box, it even makes this point. Don't buy this video. It is a pain to watch. It is awful. Jackie Chan only plays a minor role in this and the fight scenes aren't too much fun either. The dubbing is awful and the movie hasn't been reformated for standard tv viewing. Don't be like me and ignore the reviews of others, this is truely an awful film and if only I could get my money back for this."
2,Looking to waste some time?,"...because if you are and your time is of utterly no value to you than this is the film for you. I found this film to be extremely boring. I fast forwarded through almost half of it. The fight scenes were horribly choreographed (even with Jackie). Bottom line this movie SUCKS!!! Even if you are the biggest Jackie Chan fan in the world you will have to agree this movie is a waste of time. I am sure this movie's original title was nothing to the affect of ""Rumble in Hong Kong"" and this is just another marketing ploy to get people to buy some crap-o film that Jackie was in a looooong time ago. On a positive note, I did enjoy the movie's soundtrack."
1,This is pretty bad,"I wasn't sure at first whether I had seen this one or not, but When I read another reviewer's note ""bad mole"" I thought oh yeah...Jackie is not the main character, he plays a bad guy, yes one of those ridiculous bad guys you see in all other bad Hong Kong action films, the kind that make stupid mistakes and are no match for the Heroine/Hero. The print I saw was just as they said, terrible. Sometimes you can't even see who is talking, or you see half of their faces and the dub, oh man-shoot me now! I adore Jackie, but this is one you can skip. That mole sure was ugly...hairs sticking out...."
2,Poor transfer of a run-of-the-mill Hong Kong action flick,"The folks at budget label Madacy Entertainment are at it again. This is a really crummy transfer of a very ordinary 1974 Hong Kong action flick which has been retitled to capitalize on the success of Jackie Chan's ""Rumble in the Bronx."" Jackie's a villain in this one and has a pretty good fight scene towards the end of the film with the hero (a taxi driver!) that gets this two stars rather than one. The DVD includes a lengthy filmography for Chan, as well as a list of the injuries that he has suffered over the years in making his films. But other than that, the transfer is the equivalent of a VHS tape at EP speed and the source print itself is bad. For Chan completists only. All others, save your money. I paid five bucks for this and felt like I was robbed."
1,Not worth your time.,"This is a poor bootleg of the 1974 movie called Police Woman. Though it is being marketed as a Jackie Chan film it is not. His role in it is only that of a cameo and his character is referred to as a ""gang member""."
1,the worst movie ever [.],"Before I get started I want to make one thing clear. This is not a Jackie Chan movie! Jackie only comes in for a few scenes.And when he does appear he has a huge clump of hair on the side of his face! Dont get this movie confused with Jackie's box office smash Rumble In The Bronx. This movie is A.K.A. Police Women,and Young Tiger. So watch out! If you are looking for a Jackie Chan movie don't waste your money![.] If you are looking for a great Kung-Fu movie try somewhere else!"
2,More of a reference,"This was more citing origins of urban legends then telling the urban legend story. I was disappointed when I got it. I didn't really care about where a story originated or what experts thought about the legend. I want to know the story, which most the time it didn't retell."
5,PvD never ceases to amaze...,"Once again, Paul van Dyk has done it. This time with a wonderful vocal guiding the driving nature of yet another PvD classic. ""Tell Me Why"" may just be of the same magnitude as other classics ""For An Angel,"" ""Another Way,"" and ""Avenue."" If you are anyone who is interested in pumping trance which fills the soul with deep bass lines and a delicious melody, then buy this record immediately. Add another van Dyk choon to your repertoire and spin it! You wont be let down and maybe the real thing would be to say (instead of ""Tell Me Why""), Paul - ""Tell Me How"" you do it...time after time after time."
5,Great!,PvD creates a dance-floor monster by mixing St.Etienne's ethereal vocals with his trademark minor-key melodies and pumping beats. This is awesome and if you live in the NYC area try to catch PvD live at Twilo. He is incredible.
5,My Prescription - Dr. History!,"I first heard of Dr. History when I lived in the San Francisco Bay Area. During my morning commute, I often listened to KNBR's morning show, hosted by Frank Dill and Mike Cleary. A frequent feature was a brief talk about some little-known anecdote from California's past. This was presented by Jim Rawls, who was dubbed ""Dr. History"" by Frank & Mike. The stories were always short, but interesting.Jim Rawls has placed that format into book form, very successfully.The stories are still short -- good for a quick bedtime story to a child or for that brief reading time in the quietest room in your house.Following each story, Rawls has a section called ""Something More"", where he encourages you to go somewhere to experience history for yourself. (Most of the locations are in the Bay Area.)I highly recommend this book, especially for parents who are hoping to get their kids interested in history."
1,"Another ""Copy Protection"" nightmare!","Wow, thanks, Sony/BMG! You've just made a CD that's incompatible with the world's biggest online music service (iTunes). These bastards have decided to install copy-protection software (i.e. syyware) on their CDs, making them COMPLETELY worthless for the millions of honest consumers who burn music and have iPods. Granted, the DualDisk isn't copy protected, but why should I pay MORE for a DualDisc just to burn it? I should be able to rip the CD and keep a physical copy in case my computer crashed. Copy protection is self-defeating and benefits no one. Everyone loses: the artist, the consumer, and the music industry. Go to hell, Sony/BMG!"
2,'Defined' Needs to Be redefined...,"I was totally blown away by this groups first release and I couldn't wait for the next. As soon as it was available I got, played it and was absolutely dissapointed. The song choices were boring - why are they doing the same few songs every current 'pop opera' singer or group is doing? The background dance mix on a few of the selections didn't add - but detracted from the song. It was liked listening to two differnt recordings playing at the same time. On the plus side there were a few saving and wonderful pieces, but not enought to save this recording. They each have beautiful voices and collectively sound awesome, but this release does not showcase them to their best - it's a cliche and it made me sad."
1,Very disappointing and not for iPod users either,"FIRST, IF YOU HAVE AN iPOD, THIS CD WILL NOT COPY TO iTUNES OR THE iPOD.Second, overall this appears to be a poor attempt at furnishing the kind of modern classic quality which others have already done so well. Listen and if you don't want to use on an iPod, consider purchasing it, but don't buy it before you have listened to Il Divo first - very similar style but streets ahead in musical quality.Probably the most tiring recording of Nella Fantasia I have heard.Overall, it isn't bad listening, but for what they produce, there is much better out there that isn't so pompous as to protect against use on the iPod."
4,It is hard to make a sequel that is better than the original,The quality of the voices of these artists is extraordinary. At times they have the sound of a great chorale and then the clarity of a single voice that lifts one up. How five voices can be so well teamed and blended is a testament to a great producer and conductor.
4,amici not so friendly,"Alright the music is good, but we had difficulty finding anything this would play on. Only one car stereo would play the copyrighted disc. We tried computers (understood), non recordable boom boxes, a walkman and three car stereo systems also without recording capabilities. What a pain. This was good but I wont buy any more."
3,OK,"Without going into yet another song by song break down of each track, I will only say that I was left somewhat disappointed with this sophmore release by Amici.While the formula that has made their first release such a success is still intact, I found mysself at odds with most of the songs.While I very much enjoyed their twist on ""Nessun Dorma"" and ""Senza Catene"" on the last CD, I was less than taken with their interpretation of the Opera arias here.The pop/classical stuff also didn't quite grab me.Basically, I found this CD somewhat banal as compared to the first one, and thus the 3 star rating."
1,Jwin,I was disappointed to find that the system is not totally wireless and I am having trouble contacting the manufacturer regarding the remote control for the DVD player. This remote pretty much controls everything and it doesn't work at all.
2,Ewing never a stable singer,"I am surprised to read the raving comments about Ms Ewing. I watched the production as it was broadcasted by C4 about 10 yrs ago. The whole performance was just wierd. I cannot say I could enjoy the production, esp. Ms. Ewing's singing."
2,"Oh,Please...Is This Singing?","Just glance at Salome score;what the hell is she doing?Lots of groans and guttural speech in substitution to music!This evasive vocal performance by Maria Ewing can deceive ROH audiences but not Strauss' music lovers.Moreover,her calculated grimaces was always the same as to Carmen,Dido,...In despite of all his diligence,Devlin's singing hardly can be regarded appropriate to Jokanaan.In fact,he completes his performance so exhausted,just like he was drowned himself on the Sea of Galilee.After all,this is the worse Salome I've seen.There are much better on Cd's and the Malfitano/Terfel Dvd."
3,"Mediocre ""Salome""","So-so singing from Ewing. She should stick to Carmen which she does extremely well (and both videos she has done will attest to that). She does get most of the notes but the sound is not pleasant on top. I don't think I'd want to hear her live. Sometimes the singing is so soft it's barely audible. And if it can't be heard on tape it certainly wouldn't be heard in an opera house. She is capable of some fine acting but I don't think this production shows that off. Also, I find the production a little stagnant. Not much happening or interesting to look at. And if the singing isn't top notch ...."
5,"Bravo to all, especially Ewing",Oh my God! I just finished watching this. Maria Ewing is amazing. Her intense focus is wonderful. I saw a live performance of Salome a few years ago in the midwest and wished the Salome and the whole production had been more intense and a little crazy. The whole thing was just too tame. I came away wondering if Salome could be done convincingly. I wonder no longer. This is a stellar performance. It's true that Ewing doesn't always sing the notes but who cares! She gets across the meaning beautifully. Keneth Riegel is also a standout. Kudos to the whole cast. Highly recommended!!!
2,Motor was made in China!!!!,The motor was made in China. The first motor the gear did not mate up. It made a loud grinding sound. I returned it and the second motor worked OK
3,"OK, but not the best","White Mountain has been in our family for years and of the three ice cream freezers that I purchased two have already shot craps. I have had them for less than 30 days. When they work they are the best ice cream maker I have found, but I have been having motor issues. However, in White Mountains defense, when I called and explained the problem the customer service rep got some info and I got a brand new motor in the mail; no charge."
3,White Mountain,My brother bought one a few years back. It was made in America and was great quality. I bought this freezer thinking I was getting the same great quality. The first one that came only lasted 5 min. The gears locked up. The second one that came I turned it on and it made a lot of noise that I felt was not normal. I disasembled the unit and greased the gears and as of right now it is still working. The freezer performs great and is very powerful when it works. It is just a example of when it is manufactured in CHINA it is an inferrior product!!!!!!!!!
1,"GREAT ICE CREAM, VERY BAD MOTOR","Purchased the White Mountain 6 quart unit about 14 months ago. I loved it for the first year, but after about 12 batches the motor has now ground to a halt. I read the reviews when I first purchased the ice cream maker and now am a believer that the unit is a giant piece of junk. Do not purchase this unit."
5,great product,This freezer makes the best ice cream ever!!!! Had one for over 15 years and it finally wore out.
4,Good ice cream,"This machine has a good reputation so I decided to buy one and try. It did an excellent job. When we plugged in the motor to start making it sounded like a jet taking off. It is very loud, needless to say we were glad it didn't take the whole minutes to make as noted. The ice cream was very good!"
4,6 quart Ice Cream Freezer,"The first unit I received had a defective in the gears and would not run. The Amazon return process was extremely easy and the second unit was here within 2 business days. The 2nd unit works perfectly. I've had freezers from other manufactuers in the past and the White Mountain Freezer is clearly a superior unit. The other units would stop and the ice cream was still a soupy consistency. The White Mountain just keeps running, you have to listen to here when it starts to struggle. The ice cream is FROZEN to a consistency harder that what you would get a Dairy Cream but not as hard as what you get at an ice cream parlor. Yes it's expensive, but the results are worth the extra $$'s."
1,less than 5 minutes!,"I received this as a Christmas gift. When I finally got a chance to use it this summer the gears started grinding after less than five minutes. The motor shrieks like there is also a bad bearing in the top. If I take the power head off and shake it, it will sometimes run a few seconds quietly. When running quietly the drive goes about twice as fast as when it's noisy. The power transmission is the heart of an icre cream maker -- I can see expecting a cheap machine with plastic gears to have a short life span. This, however, is not a cheap machine with plastic gears. Have contacted Rival and received no feed back other than the automated message claiming 1 to 2 business days. Hopefully they will make this right and I can revise the review; otherwise my recommendation is to run the other way so you don't also end up getting three quarts of ice cream out of a $180 unit. I would give the machine zero stars if I could at this point."
1,Aluminum Ice cream yummy,Dont buy this one unless you want Alzheimer's disease .It should have a stainless steel sleeve not Aluminum . also anything with acid in it will attack the Aluminum and yummy Aluminum lemon sorbet will result .All chefs know if you use a whisk in an alumium pot your white sauce will be grey (full of Aluminum )Cheap nasty machine .
1,Defective Latch won't hold the motor to the bucket,I bought this and the first time I put it together the latch that secures the motor came right off. So I returned it and Amazon was kind enough to immediately send me a replacement. The replacement lasted a little longer. I was at least able to secure the motor and begin to use it when once again the latch came off and I had no way of securing the motor to the bucket. I'm returning it for a refund this time and shopping for a different freezer.
1,Must Have Muscles,"I love making homemade ice cream, but have to say the Rival plastic tubs ones are much better. This beast requires a hammer to close the latch, impossible to get put together, and if the paddles happen to be turned when you turn it off - good luck getting them out at all. By the time you are done, you are worn out and sweaty fighting this thing. Oh, and it leaks and you have to put it in a plastic tub."
5,Absolutely the best ice cream maker,"You can't go wrong purchasing this ice cream maker. Being ""newbies"" at making ice cream we thought it would take a while to get the hang of it. Not with this machine. Every batch has turned out great! We are delighted at how hard the ice cream turns out, not like a thick milkshake.It is a great investment; based on the quality of the machine & hardware I doubt we'll ever wear this machine out. 5 Stars for sure!!"
1,Amazon stop selling this piece of junk.,"IS A SIMPLE MOTOR SO HARD TO BUILD THESE DAYS... Mine crashed after the second use. REALLY DISAPPOINTED :(This a bad imitation of the real White Mountain, not even close. I suspected that when I saw a mispelled spanish word on the box. It is CUARTOS NOT CURATOS YOU CHINESSE LOOSERS..."
1,whitemountain 6qt electric ice cream maker,The best home made ice cream ever. Easy to operate. Great recipes come with machine. Well worth the cost.
5,White Mountian Ice Cream Freezer,"I wondered when we ordered this it wouldn't be like all other ice cream freezers that make baby food-like ice cream. It doesn't ! It's the real thing, and definitely worth the money."
3,Ice Cream Maker,"I have used this product three times and tasted a metal taste in the third batch. I notice that the chrome was coming off the metal dasher. I was also disappointed that there's no cut off switch you have to unplug it. However, it does churn well.This is one year later, when I took it out last week the dasher is rusted. I made sure when I put it up it was completely dry and rapped it in a piece of cloth. The dasher should be made of stainless steel it might cost more but it would be such a better product. This was my second one."
1,Bad,I was very disappointed in this purchase. Used it twice and the latch broke off. There are no clear instructions with it. The lid never fit properly. The ice cream would run out into the ice. Way overpriced. Actually I would not take it if you paid me to.
2,Disappointed,"It makes good ice cream, but my goodness is it noisy! For that money I expected a substantially quieter machine."
2,Love Ice Cream/Hate the Warranty Hassle,I have had my WM 6qt for 11 months. The ice cream was great but the motor has stopped working. BE AWARE THAT AMAZON only warranties this product for 30 days. The manufactures warranty for the motor is one year. I now have to go to the hassle of contacting White Mountain and securing service for a product that they did not sell to me. I anticipate issues. For a unit that cost this much the seller should back it for the indicated periods.White Mt was very easy to deal with and did replace the motor. I only gope is that it last longer. Great Ice Cream.
1,What a disappointment,"I purchased the 6-quart electric freezer. I used the first one only one time successfully. The motor burned up the second time I tried to use it. Amazon/White Mountain replaced the motor free of charge. However, the second motor only lasted 2 times. What a disappointment for this much money!!"
2,Not so good,"I had more problems with this unit then it was worth. It was really hard to close the latch, I had to use a hammer many times. The mixing blades dont seem to do a great job. I really love making icecream but this unit takes the fun out of it for me. The wooden base sometimes leaks and I do not want to spend the time trying to make the wood swell before using it each time. A plastic base is much better."
5,GREAT ICE CREAM MAKER - EASY TO USE,THIS IS A VERY NICE ICE CREAM FREEZER FOR THOSE HOT LAZYSUMMER DAYS. JUST POUR YOUR ICE CREAM MIX IN - PLUG IT INKEEP THE ICE TO THE TOP ADD ICE CREAM SALT TO THE ICE FORQUICKER FREEZING. IN ABOUT 20 TO 30 MINUTES THE UNIT SHUTSOFF ON IT OWN (WHEN ICE CREAM IS FIRM) LET STAND FOR A FEWMINUTES AND ENJOY A VERY TASTEFUL BOWL OF HOMEMADE ICE CREAMTHIS IS THE 2ND WHITE MOUNTAIN ELECTRIC ICE CREAM FREEZER THATI HAVE PURCHASED. THE 1ST ONE IS STILL GOING - THE NEW ONEIS 6 QUART INSTEAD OF 4 QUART. ALSO THE NEW 6 QUART MOTOR ISNOT AS LOUD AS THE THE 4 QUART (THE 4 QUART IS 20 YRS OLD)
1,Rival 6-Qt. Electric Ice Cream Freezer,I will be returning this ice cream freezer within the week. I have made ice cream with it 3 times and yesterday when I tried to make it again the motor was making a terrible noise. I had previously returned another one of this same freezer due to problems with the motor. I do not recommend it. My first White Mountain lasted for years but I do not think it was made by Rival. I've had nothing but problems with the Rival White Mountain electric ice cream freezer.
2,Not the machine it once was...,"Once a year in Nashville we participate in a city wide ice cream making contest to benefit a local charity. The winner has their ice cream produced by Purity Dairies for a year. Every year I try out different flavors and tweak my recipes to enter. I've won a couple of ribbons for my effort. A few years back I splurged and purchased a White Mountain Freezer because cheaper brands did not have a powerful enough motor to freeze ice creams containing lots of cream, chocolate, or eggs. The good news is that the White Mountain worked--initially. The bad news is that in only a few years, I have had to replace the motor three times and the replacement cost is almost as much as the original machine. Each time it fails more quickly than the time before. Do not rely on the overall rating for this machine as many reviews are written by new owners whose motors have not yet failed. It does make great ice cream, but only for a while."
1,warning! bad motor on 6 qt freezer,"I am very disappointed with the rival White Mountain freezer. If I am lucky in 4-6 weeks I will receive a fed ex sticker to return my defective motor with. The first person I spoke with after using the freezer 3 times and it broke, said they would send me a new moter. That was great. Then they called me back and said, oops, bad info you need to send the bad one back. We know we have issues with bad motors but sorry, you need to send it back and we will try to repair it. After 2 weeks I called back and they said it will take 4-6 weeks just to send a sticker in the mail. Who knows how long before I get a repaired, defective motor back! Needless to say, I will not be purchasing anything from Rival in the future.I will be careful what I buy from Amazon at all. I was very disgusted by this shoddy service as well as the shoddy product I was sold. Thanks for nothing Rival!!!"
5,delivery and product,Could not have been any better as far as the delivery or the product. Delivered a day earlier than posted. Product arrived with all parts in excellent condition.
4,Ice cream freezer,"A great freezer, I already own two White Mts., this is the first electric. If they would make the tub hoops of stainless this would last a life time, but I guess that's why they don't."
4,Works good,"I've used this 3 times over the last month. Works great. The only issue I've had so far is the bucket leaks which is not a big problem since i set it in a wash pan anyway. I followed the recipes I found in the book that was included and they are pretty good. I made peach, vanilla and cookies and cream. I churned the ice cream about 25 minutes each time. I have a problem hardening the ice cream after it is made but that is not the freezer's fault."
4,Great heavy duty product,"Really enjoy making ice cream in this product....we purchased the optional manual hand crank as well. It brings back the memories of making Ice Cream with my grandparents, and has given my kids a feel and insight into that time. But then when you are sick of nastalgia, you can turn on the powerful motorized crank and go to town making fabulous Ice Cream!The unit was a little on the expensive side, but in the end well worth it. Great quality on all parts. The stainless drum and lid are very high quality and the dasher head and shoulders above any other I have seen....worth the investment.In fact, I am enjoying some homemade strawberry right now...."
2,White Mountain F69206-X 6-quart Electric Ice Cream Freezer,"Very disappointed in this White Mountain ice cream freezer. After 3 uses the motor stopped working. White Mountain used to be a premier manufacturer, but not anymore. It's a shame because the first 3 batches of ice cream came out great, even though the motor literally screamed when you used it. I had read quite a lot of reviews that said the same thing, but I was hoping they had improved their product because of all the bad reviews, but they didn't."
2,The Latch is Weak,"An expensive machine with cheap parts, and crappy workmenship. After first use the latch that hold the motor in place fell off. (A small rivet broke) We replaced it with a 3/16"" nut and bolt. Now we'll see what else fails."
1,White Mountain Electric Ice Cream Freezer,I was considering buying the once reputable White Mountain Electric Ice Cream Freezer until I noticed all the dissatisfied buyers who purchased from 2009 to present! From 2009 to present not a single review is positive as all have stated that the machines broke down. They are now MADE IN CHINA and JUNK!!!!!!!!
1,Motor jammed after 2 minutes,Unfortunately I never got a chance to test this machine because the motor jammed up after only 2 minutes. I had barely started putting ice into it. I had guests coming over so was forced to go buy a cheap maker for the party. I am ordering a replacement that I hope will actually work.
1,I can't reccomend this item,"Although this item arrived when expected (I'm a Amazon Prime customer), I only got to use the White Mountain 6 qt ice cream maker 1 time - on the 4th of July. The 2nd time I was able to use it, the motor burned up. If I had not decided to check it, it would have caught our house on fire.The worse part is is that Amazon recommends contacting the manufacturer for warranty repairs/returns even though I have only had the unit for about 6wks. It arrived June 11, 2010."
2,Save your money,"It locks up about 50% of the time and then you can barely get it apart with a hammer and that is BEFORE the ice cream is frozen and still in liquid form. For the cost, it should last a lifetime with NO problems! Would NEVER buy it again!"
2,Rival ruined White Mountain,"My family has been using White Mountain ice cream freezers for over 30 years. My father had to replace his after 15 years for reasons that were not the manufacturers fault. I bought my first freezer a couple years later. These new freezers may carry the White Mountain name, but they are no way in the same class as the originals. Rival is the new owner of the White Mountain name. The new freezers are prone to break, IMO. After 2 years, the motor on my new freezer broke some teeth off the internal gears and became unusable. My father's new Rival White Mountain had almost the exact same problem. The support process with Rival is even worse. Getting a new replacement part is impossible."
3,J Erdly,Construction is ok. The motor was very noisy and finally stopped working. Motor replaced under warranty but still noisy and sometimes does not start. Grayish grease like stuff appears on lid while running and sometimes gets into the ice cream.
1,Poor Quality Construction,"I purchased this product in June of '09. I have used it less than 10 times and the gear drive in the motor unit has completely destroyed itself. There is a one year warranty on the item, but mine did not break until month 13! Although I had a parts list in my user manual, the manufacturer no longer will sell the individual parts within the motor head. They now only sell the complete motor assembly for $86.99! After making a fuss I was able to get 25% off of that price. And of course the new motor comes with a 30 day warranty.Beware! If you buy, you will be shelling out additional money to keep this thing running. It not a lie when they say, ""They just don't build them like the used too!!!!"""
5,White Mountain,"Rival F69206-X 6-Quart Electric White Mountain Ice Cream FreezerJust made the first 2 batches of ice cream with this model. It was delicious, smooth, creamy and the leftovers keep well.The motor is very strong, but also rather noisy (lets the neighbors know it is in use! so they can come and share. LOLThe wooden paddles could be attached more securely and durably, I can see that they will be a problem in a few years. I expect this freezer to last, it seems to otherwise be very durably built."
3,Ice Cream Churn,The ice cream churn was as advertised and was what my husband wanted since he had had one years before.
3,The Noisemaker,"This product looks nice, does not leak, and performs as advertised. However, the motor is so loud and noisy, you cannot stay in the same room or area with the unit. The factory says that the noise is normal, but other I/C makers we have owned were not as noisy. I will definitely not recommend this I/C maker to anyone."
4,Good but a couple small problems,"The latch holding the moter to the tub snapped off on first use. The cheap brass rivet holding latch to the tub needs to be replaced with corosion proof bolt with washer and self locking nut so that latch tension can be adjusted as required. Otherwise the icecream freezer apears to be of high quanity. Also, there were warranty information included and no contact information from the company."
1,Never purchase one,Received freezer and the motor was already bad. It smelt like burnt wires and was so loud we had to unplug it. Packaged it up and sent it back. Still have not received a refund. Will never order again.
2,Not what it used to be,"After growing with a White Mountain freezer, I believed it was the best machine to have. I finally purchased one, and to my dismay the motor quit working the second time I tried to use it. To be fair, when I called the company they said they would immediately send me a new motor. The new motor is actually in transit. I hope this solves the problem."
1,Last of a great American made prouduct,"I purchased my electric White Mountain ice cream freezer in 1993. One of the reduction drive gears finally wore out in the head unit. Like other reviewers, I'm finding that you cannot purchase components (bushings, gear sets, etc.) to repair these great old ice cream makers. An electric head unit (motor and drive assembly) can be purchased, but they're cheap Chickity-China garbage!! Hand crank units are still available, but I've heard the late model ones also have cheap Chinese made gear sets (some plastic) and will not last for more than a few batches of ice cream! What a shame this company is trading off the old reliable reputation of one the last traditional American made products. Guess I'll just have to design my own drive unit."
5,Great ice cream maker,"Ordered the unit w/2 day shipping. Received the unit on time. The ice cream maker works perfectly. Our ice cream making isn't often, so hopefully this machine will last a long time."
5,Rival 6-Qrt Ice Cream maker,"This is the real thing! I have tried other ice cream makers and this thing worked flawlessly out of the box and makes real ice cream even in a hot and humid environment with ambient temperatures of about 33 degrees Celsius and 85% humidity in a RESTAURANT kitchen and I have been using this everyday to make at least 2 or 3 batches everyday!Would definitely recommend it. A durable item that holds up in today's disposable times. A bit on the loud side as in other reviews but in a restaurant kitchen, who cares as long as it does the job reliably!"
4,Good Ice Cream!,"We found the ice cream maker itself very good and reminded us of the models available that we used in the 70's. The only complaint was the recipe book which gave the recipe for vanilla ice cream for a 6 quart freezer. We made the amount according to directions and found it was way more liquid than the recommended just over 1/2 fill on the container. If we add all of the ingredients as to cups of liquid it is much more than 12 cups. This needs to be corrected. Otherwise, it was wonderful!"
1,Peice of junk,"I bought this icecream maker in 2009 and had only used it about four times. Now this last time i went to use it 2011, the motor screeches and my husband says the gears are stripped. I'm sure it is not returnable. What a hunk of junk. This is truly a disappointment especially because I never even came close to getting my moneys worth. I will now look to buy a cuisinart and tell everyone to not purchase this item!"
3,The Motor was quite noisy .... Made good ice cream though,"The unit made some awesome and smooth ice creams. I had a couple othercheaper freezers that didn't make as good and smooth ice creams. The double actionmake a bid difference.The motor died after probably 20+ uses. It actually didn't sound right from Day-1 but Iwas too excited to use it for making some good ice cream.There were some black flakes on the top of the ice creams that I made - seems to befrom coming from the motor, but we haven't died from it.Now I need to get a motor replacement - it is gathering dust at the moment."
1,Doesn't Work,We have been successful making ice cream once with this freezer. The motor bogs down with only the slightest load (sometimes immediately after plugging it in). I guess we'll have to buy a new motor. From other online information it seems like this version was faulty and has been updated. Too bad for me.
1,Don't waste your money!,"White Mountain NDWMIME611 6-Quart Wooden-Bucket Electric-Motor Ice-Cream MakerI bought this item last year and had to return it as soon as it came. The first time we used the freezer, it was so loud we couldn't stand to be in the room with it. The sound was ear piercing! They promptly sent a replacement, but it was also very loud. Now, after using this churn a total of 4 times, it no longer will turn. I have had it less than 11 months. I would have been better off to buy a cheap one and replace it after each use than to waste my money with this product. I had read some of the bad reviews, but thought they were just a fluke, not the case at all! This product is junk!!!!!!"
5,Superb machine,I have owned this machine for two years and have been very well pleased with it's performance and expect to use it for many years to come. Superior workmanship. Built to last. This one was purchased as a Christmas gift for one of our children for this year.
5,White Mountain Ice Cream Freezer,A very well built product. Works real good. Have used it several times and enjoy the ice cream each time.
1,"Delicious ice cream, low quality parts","After five uses, one of the parts in the motor broke and now it won't churn. It is less than a month old and has been used to make 5 single quart batches of ice cream. I can't believe that the manufacturer would allow such cheap parts to be used in a $200 ""commercial grade"" motor. When it did work, the ice cream was amazing. I'm just glad it's still in warranty."
1,White Mountain Scam!,"Since White Mountain Ice Cream Freezers are well-known as the Cadillac of ice cream makers, I failed to read reviews before placing my order. BIG MISTAKE! We followed the preparation directions explicitly and were very disappointed with the results. As soon as we plugged in the motor, we had to quickly insert earplugs to protect our hearing. The motor screeched off and on for over 42 minutes and the ice cream never hardened. We noticed the sticker on the motor said ""Made in China"" so that explains the problem. After digging a little further, I found out that Rival owns White Mountain. I have been making soft home-made ice cream for years with my Rival Ice Cream Freezer, so I'm returning the White Mountain a.s.a.p. for a full refund. What a disappointment! Don't buy a White Mountain. Save your money! If you have an old White Mountain that was made in the USA, count yourself lucky! The only good thing about this purchase was the ease of return with Amazon's great customer service."
2,An American Product Ruined by a Cheap Chinese Motor,"I have owned many bargain priced ice cream makers, so I decided to purchase, the supposed, best ice-cream maker on the market the White Mountain. To date, the first ice cream maker that I ordered was broken on arrival, the second one the motor quit working after only 6 uses, and the third one is still undetermined as I have only used it twice."
4,white mountain,I have used many ice cream freezer over the years. this one with the wood tub works the best.
5,ice cream maker,Have used 5 times and makes fantastic ice cream as long as you follow directions. I use my machine outside because it is a little noisy and I don't want rock salt to get on anything inside. Suggest putting burlap or towel over machine to cut down noise and keep unit ice cold.
5,'Birds in Flight,"This is a stellar reissue, but lacks the earlier LP on Contemporary by this duo that more than one person I've met thinks is the greatest Jazz record ever made (oooh, that's a bold statement, I know)... called ""The Cry!"". Get this one and lobby Fantasy to reissue the other one as well!"
4,"Protects the EF 15mm f/2.8 nicely, but fits too tightly.","I bought this pouch to protect an EF 15mm f/2.8 fisheye lens I own. It is strong, well manufactured, and protects the lens. Then, it doesn't protect the lens as well as Sigma pouches. Then again, Sigma pouches have large volume, using a lot of bag space.Problem is the pouch is a tight fit to the lens, so unless care is taken, the lens come out without the cap, which is held by friction only.Largest problem with Canon pouches is Canon doesn't include lens hood & pouches with non-L lenses, then charge a nice markup selling those separately. This contrasts with the policy of such companies as Sigma & Samyang, who include a hood & pouch with every lens."
5,Added Protection,I love the quality of this product. The leather bottom adds more cushion that helps me to feel good about the protection of my lens.
5,Remember Flight 93,"This book is a tear-jerker; but a real tear-jearker. This is about Americans who sacrificed and were sacrificed for others. It is about the lives of each individual on United Flight 93. I say a tear-jeaker because as a Dad I cried at the thought of the many children who would not have a Dad to be there for them. Or the Dads who would no longer see their children grow up. I marveled at the lives of many of the individuals, and how full they lived. This book is indeed a memorial for who they were, how they lived, and how they died. May it help us be better people."
3,"Heartbreaking, informative. Writing style is lacking!","The information contained in this book is mesmerizing. The detailed recollections of the telephone calls are heartbreaking (told by family and friends of the victim passengers). The resolve of the passengers is inspirational - no panic, no hysteria, complete selflessness. Truly, a Higher Power was with them all.Although, moved by the information, I found the writing utterly appalling. Longman's narrative might be good if one were reading a newspaper, MAYBE; however, the writer's poor grammatical phasing got in the way of the story.""Among the Heroes"", a gift from my husband, is a quick read and, as I have said informative. The ""Sources"" section provides additional books, articles, and websites, which I have used extensively in my quest for information. Not knowing the price, I cannot say one way or another if this book is worth its cost. However, if it were more than ..., I would wait for it in paperback!"
