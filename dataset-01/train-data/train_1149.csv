5,Damn Fool,Read this book if you want to see a guy who takes an uneducated chance and losses all. Damn fool.
5,Excellent historical adventure book,"This is the best book I've read on Scott's ill-fated expedition to the ""bottom of the world,"" the South Pole. Solomon does an excellent job of defending Scott's 1912 expedition but early in the book the reader will wonder who were the audacious judges to to criticize and second guess Scott. He and his crew journeyed 900 miles through snow and ice, with long periods where the average temperatures were minus forties degrees Farenheit. In blizzards and storms, and with the primitive tents and clothing of 1912, where nobody can escape severe frostbite, they propelled themselves through brutal conditions as much for national glory as for scientifc discovery. They were amazing men."
4,Solomon's defense of Captain Scott the most articulate so far,"Susan's effort was the first I've read about the Scott expedition. Her insights are most interesting in understanding what those poor men faced in 1911-1912. However, she didn't convince me that Scott was only a poor victim of miserable weather.How can you, on one hand, be viewed as a ""scientific officer"" and show interest in progress and advancement and, on the other hand, force everybody to travel like cavemen men-hauling when dog-sledging with ski had prooven far more adequate and superior?That non-sense it's so obvious it makes Solomon's case irrelevant.But if you want to somewhat balance Roland Huntford's views and opinions on Scott, this is the book to read."
2,Confused,"The bag is nice enough, but it's just that, a bag. I ordered it thinking it was a case for my daughter's clarinet, only to see that it is a bag for a case. I suppose if I needed such a bag, this would fit the bill. However, since it is just a bag, after all, I could easily find one that was of equal quality for less than the nearly $30 I paid for this one."
4,summary of my use of the product,Have read this product but not used it yet. I believe it will suit my purposes.
1,Distinctively Christian? NO WAY!,"While describing this book, the Stephens Ministries site says that ""Dr. Haugk blends the best of the social sciences with a distinctively Christian approach to caring and relating to provide a valuable guide for nonprofessional caregivers.""This leader's guide is in no way approaches caregiving in a uniquely Christian way. In fact, this book often blends Christianity with Buddhist teachings and practices into the exercises given. How can a book be ""distinctively"" Christian with underlying Buddhist thought?"
5,"A great ""how to"" book","A clear, concise explanation of best practices and pitfalls for thosewho would offer caregiving in a compassionate and Christ-like way.This is no sappy, do-gooder book... and it's no ""fix-it"" messageeither."
1,Don't be mislead,"The book is like an ocean, poorly organised. No pictorial representations (which I think is very important when we discuss data modeling). I bought this book to refresh my data modeling knowledge-- disappointing. May be useful for some students to clear some papers, for pros - please find something else."
1,Not even the right cable...,"I received this item in a ripped up box, but more importantly, it was the wrong cable. Instead of the firewire plug, it had a regular usb. Amazon took care of the problem immediately, but I would stay away from this seller!"
1,"Actor Yes, Singer NO!","If you are looking for music then let Ol' Billy Bob alone. His voice is off key more than on key and his back-up band is primative at best. Also, the sound/recording quality is lacking which will prove to your ears that Billy Bob's home studio needs a little professional help. Did I tell you about BBT's song writing skill? There is none! BBT's albums are fair comic recordings but music, it is not there. CAUTION: Play the samples before you buy so you will know what to expect. Like I said, his movies are great but don't let him sing."
3,Tedious,"If you own Queensryche's ""The Warning"", you already own everything this opera tries to deliver. Eight different singers and every one of them imitates Geoff Tate every time they open their mouths. The instrumental backings all sound like Queensryche tracks copied, cut and pasted (multiple times) in Cakewalk. Absolutely no innovation whatsoever, the lyrics are straight out of Dungeons & Dragons, and the best compliment I can give the endeavor is ""competent""."
1,What's so great about this cd?,"First, let me say that I had great expectations about this cd before I bought it. Everybody seemed to love it. But man, was I in for a surprice. This is just an very ordinary cd. It could be any of Tobias earlier releases with Edguy. This is in the same vein. And you know how it is with Edguy: If you have heard one you have heard them all. There's nothing new here either. And haven't all you guys got bored with Tobias voice? At least I have. I don't see the point in spitting out cd after cd if it all sound the same. If you can't write great, catchy songs, it doesn't matter how many of the worlds greatest musicians you put together on the same cd: it will still not be good. The only light on this cd is Michael Kiskes vocal. You do off better by buying Edguys only good effort: ""Theater of Salvation""."
5,excellent,"Definately not poser/nu-metal, and if you like Edguy then you'll definately like this because it's true, they're pretty similar (and if you're complaning that they're too similar, duh, the frontman from Edguy made this). I listened to it once, got hooked, bought pt. 1 and 2. It's basically metal with a story line and melody with a few ballads thrown in."
1,Boo Hiss!,"I purchased the Kensington Accessory Adapter to connect my iPod Shuffle to my Bose Sounddock while at work.Used in this application, the adapter creates an annoying ""hiss."" Playing at a louder volume can drown out the hiss, but it's always there in the background.Bad unit or just unsuitable in this application?"
2,Not appropriate for all applications,"This adapter worked fine for charging and for sound output, but be aware of some key limitations:1) This adapter is too large to fit into many docking stations. I found I could only connect it to other items using iPod cables.2) Although it will charge and allow one to play music from the iPod, it doesn't provide full functionality. When I connected it to a computer, my Mac did not recognize the shuffle. This was the case whether or not I'd pre-launched iTunes.So, if all you want to do is connect your shuffle to a car transmitter/charger or other cable-based device, this adapter is fine. If you want to use docks or make your computer-connected iPod cable do double-duty for your shuffle and for your other iPods, this isn't the solution for you."
3,retro NFL nostalgia almost at its best,"These are your typical great quality Riddell (yes, the exact same company that make the real NFL helmets) Pocket Pro (or mini) helmets with a retro twist. I love how the packaging it comes in puts the old division names--Capital, Century, Coastal, Central.The only picky points I have are the LA Rams' horns look way too thin, the New Orleans Saints logo looks way too oversized and what is going on with the Philadelphia Eagles logo? The wings so not look as smooth as Harold Carmichael.I think Riddell did a better job with the 1969 AFL Throwbacks than the NFL ones."
4,Monster Cable High Performance Component Video and Analog Audio AV Kit: Review,"I recently purchased this for my 32"" Samsung Slimfit HDTV and right from the get go I could notice the picture difference when compared to the standard Component cables(Yellow-Red-White). Especially in very dark scenes, you can tell the difference.All-in-All you are getting Monster quality cables which is one of the best when it comes to durable cables. I would recommend these cables to anyone who is looking for a picture upgarde on their HDTV but at the same time, dont want to spend too much $$.Good buy, but not a great buy."
1,Terrible,"I know, it's not wasabi and it's not supposed to be. I get that.However this tastes LITERALLY like horseradish mixed with mayo. There are wasabi alternatives that actually taste somewhat close to natural wasabi. This stuff is horrible, I picked some up today at Kroger's and am thinking about taking it back (I've never done that before in my life)."
2,Easy to use but...,"S&B Wasabi is very easy to use. It is packaged in a nice squeese tube. However, the so-called wasabi just tastes like horseradish made with green food coloring. If you are a picky fan of sushi as I am, it might be best to look elsewhere for the wasabi experience that you are looking for."
4,Great Taste,This is the best pre-packaged Wasabi I have found. It has a great texture too. I only buy this now that a friend recommended it and I tried it.wa
5,Wasabi,I love wasabi and in particular the S&B brand. Finding it online at a great price was wonderful and the seller shipped it quickly. I will return to this seller again.
2,Neither good electronic nor good Metallica,"As a long-time Metallica and electronic music fan, I am quite disappointed with this CD. Not only does this album not do justice to the Metallica songs it attempts to recreate, but it's also nothing special as far as electronic music goes. This CD was probably envisioned to do something similar to the S&M album, which exploited the amazing qualities of two clashing musical genres; but it definitely fails to do that. On most of the tracks, the Metallica lyrics are not skillfully integrated into the techno beats, so the words sound just plain useless. Many of the tracks distort the songs so much that I could not even tell which song a track is trying to imitate without looking at the track listing. This is quite a poor album, I would not recommend it."
1,Horrible Just Horrible,"Those Bastards in this tribute cd don't even deserve to listen to the best metal band since Sabbath. The covers sound gay because it sounds nothing like the real thing. These covers are so stupid don't waste your time or your money, for crying outloud get real people that know Metallica,s Music. Good examples are Anthrax and Apocalyptica."
4,They said it's quiet - and it IS quiet,"One of my main problems with excercise bikes of any kind is that they are just so noisy. This one makes really no noise at all. Very pleased with it. I just wish there was some solution that could be done with your legs under the desk. Oh well, this is a pretty nice unit, and certainly superior than having a big bike sitting around."
4,Great way to exercise lower body,"I have very bad knees and this pedal exerciser helps a lot. The only thing I have had to alter is adding weights to the base nearest to me as I sit. Without the weights to stabilize the machine, the exerciser wobbles as I pedal."
3,Ok ring.,"I ordered this ring because I am allergic to nickel. The length is somewhat short for me. I broke the top ball the first time I put it on, because I twisted it on too hard. I haven't worn it again, but plan to when my piercing gets better and when I find another top ball."
1,Not a good table,"I bought this table set a couple of days ago for my son's 2nd birthday.He loves it.I hate it.It's going back to the store asap.The chairs tip over easily,I think because they are so lightweight,of course my son thinks this is great.We have wood floors and the chairs slide and tip when he tries to get in or out,plus the back of the chairs are so short that when he leans back they tip.Not a safe table"
1,Not Real Stable,"There are a couple things I don't like about this set. First and foremost those chairs. Everything that you've read in the previous posts about the chairs tipping are 100% accurate. My daughter has fallen off enough to the point that she's afraid to be put near those chairs. Another thing that I didn't like too much was the actual table top. It wasn't straight. If you put a crayon in the center of the table it'd roll off. It was hard to do anything with it. Who knows maybe our table just had a defect. Either way, thank goodness we still had it's orignal box because back to Toys R Us it went!"
1,Don't buy this table.,"We bought this table and matching toy box for our daughter. Love the toy box but hate the table. After setting the table up we noticed that the table top had a big bubble, we packed it back up and took it back to toys r us to exchange it for another one thinking it was just a defect. All of the tables had the same bubble. Don't waste your time buying this table"
1,This is dangerous!!!,"I purchased this set less than a week ago and it's going back to the store. The chairs tip over too easily. My daughter has fallen off the chairs numerous times hitting her head each time. She has fallen when trying to get onto the chair, off of the chair and also while in the chair reaching across the table. The legs have been designed too close together and have no stability. The chairs are so lightweight, this is inevitable. Lightweight is usually good but not this time. As they say, you get what you pay for. But I cannot afford too many trips to the ER so this is going back."
1,This thing SUCKS,"Creates air leaks. I rated it 5 stars for educational value, because it taught me that sticking something in the middle of fuel line is a stupid idea.I also rated it 5 stars for durability, because when I yanked it off and threw it into the street, it was still just as crappy as it was before.Don't waste your $10. If you're going to do so, send me $10 so I can tell you how much it sucks. I don't even charge shipping!"
3,Save your money,"You are better off spending your money elsewhere. This book is not well written, and gives cursory treatment to many important areas of Micro theory. Compared to the other dominant Micro texts, it falls way short."
5,Wellness Pure Vension Treats,Our bulldogs have a restricted diet. These treats work well for them and they love to eat them. No issues with allergies to the product.
2,TITLE MISLEADING,"this is a story book! this book is only based on HER life experience and OPINION. If that's what you're looking for then this book is fine, and it may be interesting to you if you want to read of one person's experience as evidence of the validity and reliability of the chinese zodiac.but personally it was not helpful for me, because i'm not interested in reading someone else's opinion for this subject, because i already have my own, you don't need to convince me that people display characteristics of their sign.this is a story book, so the title is misleading!it's not a bad book, but it wasn't useful to me, it's just not what i thought it was going to be, it's not what i was looking for."
5,Classic Great!,"I really love this movie! I love westerns, and this is one of the best. I will watch it again, hopefully with my grandchildren. I am a grandmother!"
5,This book does a great job of explaining what wrong with the Us,"Rauch's argument is that the system is broke, largely because the system has been become infested with interest groups. These interests are lobbying government for their own benefits, which does not always align with the larger public. The interest groups are successful, so this ensures that policy will move away from the common good. With all the groups at work in DC and with all of the success they have, the citizenry cannot expect the common good to animate the creation of public policy. The end result of all this, according to Rauch, is that innovative and effective policy reform cannot be expected to occur. Thus, the system will never be fixed and will always cause some people to be angry and unhappy with the system."
4,Wish printed materials came with it!,"The DVD is a bit dated, but okay. It is difficult to follow the pieces since there is no printed materials. Looks like there is version for sale with a book - I should have probably gotten that one."
4,Excellent recording,"The Bill board review is spot on. The remastering on this is excellent. I had the original CD since it was released on Virgin in 1988 and the difference is great between the two. The texture and atmosphere on this is so much better and the soundstage is clean and wide, easy to pick out the playing and really appreciate what Laswell and friends accomplished here."
3,Simply Wonderful,"This CD is just as great as the more recent ""Ronan"" CD. I clicked on 3 stars in error. This is a 5++ star album! His voice is sheer perfection, and the songs are wonderful. I also highly recommend the DVD of ""The Impossible Dream,"" even though I didn't care at all for the London Community Choir who sing four songs. Note: The American version of the DVD doesn't have the 25-minute ""Dr. Courageous"" extra on it that the Irish version does. I saw him in concert last month, and besides having a voice that soars to the rafters, he is warm, funny and endearing."
5,Jill Paquette,"Seldom does a CD of this quality come along for any style of music. This CD has everything; meaningful lyrics, great melodies, beautiful guitar playing, and Jill Paquette's fabulous voice and singing style. Very highly recommended!!!"
5,A fantastic addition to my music collection!,"This cd is simply wonderful. Not only am I constantly listening to it myself, but I have also given it out as a birthday gift and purchased 4 more for Christmas gifts! Jill has an amazing voice, great instrumental talent, and her lyrics are touching and inspirational. I highly recommend this cd to anyone who appreciates great acoustic music and intelligent, thoughtful lyrics."
3,paul creston: symphony n.4- violin concerto,"personally i think that the 4th symphony is less spontaneous and inspired than the previous ones and than the following one, whereas the violin concert reveals a full knowledge of the form and of the instrument by the composer. very good execution"
1,Boring and Uninformative,Probably the worst book I've ever purchased on the Supernatural.To say that the information on the ghosts themselves is brief would be an understatement.If I just want to get directions to a place I'll buy an atlas.Save your money.
1,Buy it on sale,I bought this book for $1.97. It was worth the price I paid--not a penny more. It wasn't very helpful in finding the haunted places within. I agree with the others in lowly rating this book
4,Cool Book by a New Author,"What can I say except she's got me very curious to know what's gonna happen in her next book. A plot of love/lust, betrayals, vengeance...and the characters were realistic--my favorites were Alexandra, Kurt and Antonio. (Kurt dressing up as WonderWoman for the campus party was hilarious). Sallos was completely throwed-off (in MANY ways)to be a vampire, which was really cool and different--I never saw a vampire with so many rage issues-- and I'll back Heather up on this...I totally agree with a lot of the stuff he said about the world and the people of today. I also like the idea that it took place around Halloween. I hope the author gets to be as popular as today's well known writers-this book should definitely be checked out!"
5,Another Good Old Horror Movie,"Lon Chaney, what can I say besides he is a great actor.Not sure what year the movie is made in for sure but it is an old black and white movie. The movie has 3 stories in it told by ""the devil"" Lon Chaney Jr. The First story is about a photographer that takes a picture of a woman next to a house. The woman is far away in the picture but every time he looks at the picture the woman gets closer and closer. The next story is about a group that is down in the mines and they come across a woman in ice. One of the men goes crazy over the woman and says that he loves her. The last story is about a man that has a dream that he is in a dark alley and he sees a door and goes inside. There is a Fortune Teller that says that she will kill him at midnite.This is a really good old Chaney movie. If you like some of his other movies I think that you will like this one. Pick it up at amazon."
4,Good resource for someone in the business,"This book is a must-have reference for anyone in the jewelery business, but probably too technical for someone interested in learning about jewelery. Nicely organized."
5,"The only box, i'll ever buy or need","I bought one of these boxes about 10 years ago when they were a pretty new style and i loved it, the amount of storage Plano fit into a tiny box still baffles me. After my tailgate came open on my pick-up and my box fell out, there was only 1 style that i was going to replace it with... the same one. A great box by a great American company. 5 stars isn't enough."
4,Super Dave's new move is great,"I thought it was a great movie. Anyone who watches this film will laugh almost as much as they probably did when they watched the first Austin Powers movie. Even if you have to clue who Super Dave is, it is still a very funny movie. I can't believe that this was never released in the movie theaters."
3,Not what I thought,"When Super Dave first came out years ago, I thought it was hilarious. Now, pretty funny but I don't see it as the riot like I did back in the day."
1,Not a good movie,"OK, I laugh as just about anything including Super Dave skits but this was a poor attempt a movie. Some funny spots but you will wonder if you can get your hour and a half back after watching this. Those that ""really liked"" this movie must be promoting it because they have copies to sell. Don't buy this if you are looking for the same level of humor as the old Super Dave skits."
3,Not bad,"As big of a Super Dave fan as I am, I have to say I was a little disappointed in this movie. As with Mr. Bean, Super Dave's ""bit"" is at its best with short skits, and deviates from its genius in full-length movies.There were some entertaining parts, but the movie frankly is not that good and can only be enjoyed by die-hard Super Dave fans. Regardless, it is Super Dave, and an average movie is better than no movie."
5,A Good Read for Brant Lake & ADK Enthusiasts,"I loved this book. I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Roberts as a seven year old child (in 1962),while vacationing on Brant Lake. This book had just come out. He was a lovely man. Although in his eighties by that time, his enthusiasm and sincerity was that of a young man.A terrific read if you enjoy learning about life in the southern Adirondacks at the turn of the (last) century.I still spend summers on Brant Lake; I love to read this and visualize the areas of his homeland as they were."
1,Loading new lead is not convenient at all.,"The BIC ClicMaster #2 looks great and has an amazing eraser. My problem is the tedious manula loading required for EVERY new lead replacment. You have to pull open the eraser, grab one of the extra leads, then hold down the buttons as you slowly feed it into the pen!Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I doubt it. I've tried opening everything. I've tried patiently clicking the pencil 100x's w/ no lead coing through.Bottom Line: find something else and save yourself from the messy re-filling required!"
1,Wate of Money,"Soon as i took it out the bag, the fur started falling off. very cheap material. By the time you finish using it, you'll be left with just metal."
2,not strong enough,it is very week doessnt actually restrain partner the rud fuz falls off very easily . . . . .
2,Do not buy!!!!!!,Fur falls off instantly!!! I feel like i waste \d my time and my money. Definitely do not recommend this to anyone!
2,A Gimick,Not even very functional but I guess it works if all you are looking for is a presentation.
5,I love this book,"Pocketful of Miracles is absolutely the best book out there, especially if you are looking for daily meditations and uplifting stories about life. I first purchased this book in 1994 shortly after my mother had passed away. This book was so intuitively on target and provided an avenue to put everything in life in perspective for me. I have since given this book as a gift to friends and family, as it is extremely helpful if you are going through life changing situations. It combines all of the wonderful aspects of all religions and provides insight into the human condition.If you are searching for some answers, or just trying to figure out life, I highly recommend this little book. It is definitely a ""miracle"" book."
5,Daily Reminders,"I like this book because it is gentle. It does not command or direct. It more suggests ways to get in touch with the best in yourself. Even in the the Introduction, the author does not chastise the reader for going weeks, months or even years without opening the book. Whenever you can get to it, it is useful. It is a book for a lifetime."
5,great,"uplifting, spiritual, touches all religions....bringing them all to the same community. It is a great gift for anyone, fine way to start the day!"
5,Pocketfull of Miracles,"Pocket Full of Miracles in PaperbackI have purchased this book many times, especially as gifts to my friends. They all rave about the contents and its effect on their spiritual growth. I love this book!!!!!"
1,Deception,"We were very disappointed, upon opening the package, to see how small the glasses are. I was concerned about this when I purchased them, but could find no info on size (and the seller is very careful to not show them near anything else that might give you a hint as to how small they are (2 inches in diameter at the largest point and only 4 1/4 inches tall; I can hide the entire glass in my closed fist)."
4,Recommended for self-study and classrooms alike,"LL ENGLISH FOR NEW AMERICANS is an excellent resource for a self-study program as well as a great addition to an ESL (or, in my case, EFL) classroom. ESL/EFL students will find its format easy to follow and its content useful for their everyday needs in the States. The accompanying video and audio cassette are motivating and provide ample practice for listening skills. The accompanying workbook provides practice for written skills. The ESL teacher will also appreciate LL ENGLISH FOR NEW AMERICANS as a stimulating supplement in the classroom. Many activities can be expanded into roleplays and many situations can be transferred to students actual needs. Without a doubt the program is recommendable to both students and teachers."
4,pleased,"the tips i ordered were awesome. they came in a perfect variety of sizes and work great for a variety of things like piping mashed potatoes and veg. purees; not to mention perfect for various designs for frosting cakes. i recommend these to everyone who enjoys cooking and or baking. the best part is they are stainless steel so they last forever. Easy to clean, and the hold their shape way better than plastic of tin."
3,Samples from a master,"These five stories, ranging from weak to strong, are nevertheless the unmistakable craft of a master storyteller. The words flow from the page as if spoken aloud in a quiet firelit room by someone accustomed to entertaining a rapt audience.Forsyth, like a distinct cuisine, should be sampled, and this collection is the perfect opportunity to do so. Not all the stories will be appealing, but they are all masterful."
3,3 out of 5,"NOTE: I'm not actually 1. I just can't be bothered to creat an account.Normally I'm a huge Forsyth fan, but this I can't say that this was one of his materpieces (in the tardition of Jackal, Odessa, etc). Having said that, ""The Veteran"" is one of the finest stories I've read in a long time. Ot had me going the entire time. ""The Citizen"" was riviting, yet mildly predictable. But then again, the prediction I made turned out to be wrong. And ""The Art of the Matter"" was great for its detective work. The other two didn't do it for me. Despite winning the Edgar for it, ""Snakes"" let me down - it seemed too easy and rushed. And ""Wind"" was too implauasible for me. He gets cred for trying, but it just didn't pan out. This is a fabulous airplane book - will get you from North America to the UK. Buy it for cheap at the airport, or get it from you local library for free."
4,Mostly good stories,"""The Veteran"" was fantastic (stop whatever you are doing and go find this story now)So was ""The Art of the Matter"".Despite what other have said I also like ""The Miracle"" however that is where my praise for the collection ends.The Citizen is fine and would be good if it had not been done 5,000 times before.Whispering Wind starts out strong true to its genera and then does a stupid Rip Van Winkle turnaround. It is a completely moronic plot twist I was left scratching my head."
3,"Well written, but no payoff","I like this author's novels, but this collection of short stories was disappointing. I can see that the ending of each is supposed to be a shocking twist, but there's really not much of a payoff. The tough part is that the guy is a very good writer. By the middle of each story, you're really into it, and you're anticipating great things, but then it just kind of limps to the end. I suppose they're OK if you just want a quick diverting read, but there's not much more here."
3,The last story was terrible,First time i 've read the author with short stories. 3 Stars and well spaced out in terms of believablity and holding one's interest.An exception is the last story in the book. Hard to believe an writer of Forsyth ability could pen such drivel.Over the top to say the least. Not close to his quality. If i didn't know better i would suspect he borrowed it from some 5 th grader.TThrasher
2,A Forsyth Fan Disappointed,I'm a huge Forsyth fan...his writing is usually second to none and his thrillers are real page turners. It had been awhile since he wrote anything so I was elated to see this book hit the stands. Unfortunately it was a big disappointment. The writing was tired and the stories very predictable. It was not at all his usually quality of work. Either he unearthed a selections of short stories from when he was just learning to write or he needed money badly and vomited out this drivel. I pray his next effort is better. I remain a devoted fan but warn the reader that this book is sub-par.
2,Kinda Bored and quite disappointed,"I've tried very hard to finish the first one. I was very impatient to read along and could not help thinking while trying: If a short story would have made me so difficultly to read along with the going-nowhere and bored to death storyline; a short story that after 5 minutes seemed to become longer and longer, what if it's a novel? Two thugs and one old limping guy, with bloody broken nosebridge and coma. flower shop, hospital, wallet.... What's going on? I have to regretfully admit that after failed twice to appreciate ""The Fist of God"" and ""The Icon."" and after so many years craving for his upcoming new novels, I finally have to drop this author as I've dropped so many others such as Thomas Harris, Stuart Woods, David Morrell, Lawrence Block, Robert Parker.....and even Robert Ludlum. SIGH...... As to Jeffrey Archer, well, his later stage novels kinda ..., but his collected short stories are still the best and quite eye opening!"
3,"ORDINARY PEOPLE,WEIRDO STORYLINE, O.HENRY'S ENDING","I bought this book a few days ago.TO my suprise ,this is the first time that Frederick Forsyth wrote the short storys.The publisher called them the suspense fiction of Frederick Forsyth .Each story has a different theme,of course the different storyline.They're all independent.Not like the orignalnovel he had written,they are all about small guys.Some can predict the ending before you finish them, some have the O.Henry's ending that will make you astonished,but don't feel good as <The Devil's Alternative> which has the best O.Henry's ending that I've ever seen."
2,"Good, but...","Forsyth is a ""monster"" writer, one of my all-time favorites, but, as it's often the case, he's already past his prime. That happened with the obnoxious ICON. As for this collection, it's good, but one can see clearly that FOrsyth has the hability to produce stuff like that by the hundreds, even in his sleep!!The stories in theirselves are good, but you will miss absolutely nothing if you do not read them, even being a Forsyth fan.In short: for the completists only!"
1,How the mighty have fallen!,"If the name Frederick Forsyth evokes fond memories of The Day of the Jackal or Dogs of War keep it like that and do not buy this turkey. It is hard to believe that the same author penned The Veteran and the aforementioned books. The plotting is strictly ""by numbers"" at a level of creative writing class run at a community centre, the characters are two-dimentional and laughable and the ""twists"" would pose no intellectual challenge to a first grader of average intelligence. The blurb states ""Five breathtaking tales..."". Yes, the ineptitude of the writing certainly takes your breath away. Yet another sad decline of a once great writer."
1,Superficial and dishonest analysis,"As a Catholic theologian and ordained clergyman, I am embarrassed by this sort of superficial analysis. This is not a sincere attempt at establishing a serious dialogue, but a cheap caricature. Moreover, the author's own views are presented as though they reflect Catholic tradition. Instead, they reflect Catholic modernism, thinly veiled. I accept historical criticism and the legitimate gains made by modern scholars, but the view of Scripture in this book is much closer to liberal protestantism than to the Church's official teaching. Fundamentalism serves as a convenient surrogate for attacking the Church's own high view of inspiration and inerrancy. What a shame. And a sham."
4,Good Celtic dance music,"The music here would be best done in front of a live audience, but thie is good Celtic dance music. It lacks the pinache of Silly Wizard, but you still et a good feel for the ""stutter step"" style of playing on the fiddle."
1,Irish elevator music,Was looking for a good St.Patrick's Day CD. Picked this up without any recommondations and found it was very repetitive. Way too much fiddle playing.
2,Nice ideas but poor writing,"Jason Dougherty's bio says he's a musician. Well he might have some musical chops, but his writing chops leave a lot to be desired. Although his ideas are good enough, his prose is awkward, wooden and predictable."
4,Fascinating.,This is a fascinating book. There's a lot of great science in there and many educated guesses and hypothesis that are fodder for thought. Would makea great book club choice for the very adventurous group discussions. Parts of the book(example stories) were surprisingly racy and unexpected. Basically sais that the body has it's own agenda to reproduce and that's separate from your own plans. Hormones bridge the differenece and cause spontaneous behaviors. The real interesting stuff is the science of how the body undermines your own plans to either conceive or not conceive--both for men and women. Also interesting is how the state of mind affects fertility. What a fascinating mystery. I was left with amazement at how easy it is to get pregnant when you're not planning and how difficult it can be when you are! Each child is so very miraculous--a result of so many bizarre variables that all come together in a moment.
4,Interesting,"I found this book very interesting although I did not agree with every conclusion the author comes to. I think it is fascinating to see some of the real subconscious reasons that lie beneath our actions. I disagreed however, with the simple descriptions and reasoning for oral sex. I believe there is more to it than that, especially for women. He seems to think the only purpose for oral sex is to sniff out infidelity and I doubt that is the case because oral sex for many women helps bring them to orgasm and an orgasm causes contractions that push sperm faster towards the egg. The chapter on gang rape was disturbing and I thought the portrayal of prostitution was probably a little too happy go lucky but overall an interesting read."
2,meh,"I was hoping for something along the lines of ""The Moral Animal."" This book cites no sources, too much fluff, and seems like just hypothesis. I'm aware that he says that another book he published had the sources and research but that's what I thought I was buying."
1,Fantasy and Lies - NOT Science!,"A book named after something that doesn't even exist.There's a reason why the author of this fantasy book avoids citations (no, it's not the reason the author gives in his book).It's the same reason why the original subtitle ""The Science of Sex"" was changed:this book is NOT based on science at all. It's based on the author's fantasy.Robin Baker is a mediocre scientist (at best) - he's even worse as a fantasy author."
1,Dubious science - buyer beware,"Just a warning to readers of this book. The favorable ratings and reviews fooled me into thinking this was established science and well respected in academia. It is not. While the hypotheses and stories are intriguing and entertaining, the science behind it has not held up in the past decade. People have not been able to replicate many of Robin Baker's findings, and the whole notion of ""sperm wars"" in humans seems to be false. For instance, under the microscope, the ""kamikaze"" sperm and ""egg-getters"" don't seem to exist. Combining two men's sperm doesn't increase mortality of the sperm either, dispelling the notion of ""killer"" sperm that don't attempt to find the egg. The fact that Robin Baker has left academia and now labels himself an ""author"" not a biologist should be telling. More recent work has provided a far more nuanced and less hyped version of sperm competition."
3,"A little disappointing, but worthwhile","I had high hopes for this book after hearing so many of my friends rave about it. However, I was a little let down. First of all, there are no foot-notes or citations for any of the claims/statistics that Baker writes about. I understand that the book reads easier without them, but it takes a lot of the credibility away from the message. Also, the constant referral to previous/future ""scenes"" (37 small stories) throughout the book really made it difficult to follow.I read in a couple other reviews for this book that a lot of the ""science"" Baker writes about has been proved wrong. One of the reviewers actually posted a link to a scientific article which conducted some experiments contradictory to Baker's research, so if you feel inclined it's on this website somewhere.Anyway, the book did have a couple (valid) discoveries that were new to me, so all was not lost. Just wish Baker had done a better job of backing up his research!"
2,"Sex is fun, this book . . . less so.","This book is just really weirdly written. Each chapter begins with a little soft-core porn scenario - like something you'd find in a romance novel, only slightly less sexy. It's then followed by a fairly long explanation of what just occurred. Baker opened the book saying that she would try not to get too statistical and biological-sounding so as to not bore the crap out of us . . . but even without charts and tables, it's tough to get through. The sex scenes certainly appeal to the voyeur that lies deep within every sexual being, but the rest of the book is hardly worth it. When there are so many other books out there on this topic written so much better - more interestingly, with humor, whilst still being scientifically factual - Baker really dropped the ball on keeping her audience captivated."
3,A Somewhat Stilted Portrayal of Introverts,"This book surveys the life of the introvert from childhood all through later phases of life. While many of the difficulties which introverts experience, and Meares discusses, are real, I think that they are exaggerated. Also, Meares fails to consider the fact that people can change. In fact, many shy children grow up to be well-adjusted, if not exactly outgoing, adults. This book does not come to grips with this fact."
3,Search out the original material instead,"It's a shame that Jack couldn't stir up enough interest in the new material included on this best of Joykiller compilation. The ""Dear No One"" Gentleman Jack certainly deserved it's own full length CD; for Jay Smith's excellent contributions to the material make for what, to me anyway, ranks as Grisham's best post TSOL material bar none! Sadly this cannot be said about the follow-up ""Go"" material. Seems to me that too many cooks spoiled the broth on this disjointed effort. Having said that I still feel both should have been released on their own merits. Do yourselves a favor and seek out those who may actually own the original Go/GJ recordings, make yourselves some copies, and then decide if you really need this cobbled together release. Even better are the never released Ron Emory/Jack Grisham Joykiller demos...oops...I've said too much already."
1,"Defective, Amazon won't help","Only charges to 63%. Amazon has no system for complaints, returns, resolutions - because it was sold by amazon and it is battery (hazardous).They suggest the manual, the manufacturer - which I am trying, but, we have a commercial vehicle down in a field waiting for a jump.Frustrating - it is better to purchase from a reseller than from Amazon directly."
4,Almost perfect,"I have been trying to find a great old fashioned wiener, like the kind I use to eat when I was a kid. Schwan's home delivery had some fantastic ones for a couple years, but they have been discontinued. They were the best that I have found - so far.The Bavaria Old Fashion Wieners are pretty close, and are very tasty. I like them better than the Boars Head natural casing wieners - available in most supermarkets.They were shipped in a Styrofoam lined box, with ""blue ice"" type freeze bricks to keep them cold.Excellent service and very tasty!"
2,these are not Bavarian Wieners,First it was a mistake to order this Product because I wanted Casings so I can make my own Sausage but it was my mistake but than I tried the Wieners there are O.K but defently not German or Bavarianso every German who is out there and is looking for a taste from homeI'm sorry you want get it with this Product
1,Ace wheel barrel,"We bought this wheel barrel and by the time it got here in pieces we found it was neither the color we asked for or worth the price. It was sent back by us and we had to pay for shipping and handling inspite of THEM not sending the right wheel barrel! I shouldn't have bought another one there, but since we needed one we did. The wheel was flat on arrival, unfortunately we kept it and by the time I went to use it in the spring, it was flat again. It was too bad for us, and too late. I recommend sending back flat wheels as they are usually defective if they arrive like this. It rusted out the first summer of using it in my small gardens and this was not ""industrial use"" by anyones measurement. I don't feel this was a good value at all. I wouldn't buy it from them again. I didn't like dealing with ACE and I felt their product was over rated and not at all like the picture they used to sell it. I wouldn't buy from them again."
4,This book was a good quick read.,"I am an 8th grader and this book was a very quick read. It was very gripping and well written! I never got bored with it, and I finished it in two days. I reccomend this book to anyone 5th grade and up who likes mystery or action books!"
5,A great singular release from an underrated artist,"I bought this CD after one of Milo's concerts with Mountain Stage in 1991. I remember being completely emotionally struck by the lyrics in his work, as well as the intimate nature of his guitar work. I have always wondered what became of Milo, and I feel that his songwriting vicariously lives on in the work of like artists such as Jonathan Coulton and other Witrock songsters. I strongly suggest this sweet and bitter album for all."
2,Too small,"This is a good idea, but I find the cloth too small. It's also too difficult to push the cloth back into the little bag. And finally, I think clip attachment should be a little longer. I don't recommend this one for professional work. See my uploaded photo."
4,worked as expected,"This is a simple, self contained wipe. it does what it is supposed to do. It simply clips to a camera strap and when needed the wipe is unfolded from within a little pouch.I have it on my 60D and use it regularly. I have had no negative issues."
4,works pretty well,still requires quite a bit of wiping but I guess this is to be expected. I like the fact it is on a clip (I attached it to my camera bag) and that it all retracts (almost) in its little red riding hood to stay clean. pretty clever.
4,Works as advertised,You can't ask for more than is advertised and that's what this cloth did. It worked well. Can't ask for more than that.
3,nice and cheaper than Nikon version but,"you could just use one of the free micro fiber cloths that came with the glasses you got from your optometrist. Those are washable, by the way, and never wear out!Otherwise, this is the way to go."
2,I don't have much of a review because it wasn't much of a film...,"This was one of the most boring films I have ever seen. It was extremely short for the subject matter presented, and the acting was amateur at best. There were too many people and dialogs moving in and out of certain scenes that made it seem like amateur stage acting, something you would have seen on Monty Python's Flying Circus, only The Pythons were actually entertaining."

4,Great design for the guys...but made for smaller ear lobes,"I bought these as a gift for my son and he was very pleased with the design. Very good for the guys out there looking for a hoop earring that's not girlie.The mechanics of this earring have good and bad sides though. The earring is very difficult to ""click locked"" into place on a larger male ear. Perhaps they should consider making the stem a bit longer to fit the male ear. However, that being said, once it is on, you won't have to worry about losing it! My son doesn't remove his, so its not an issue - at least at the moment!"
4,Don't be a sucker again!,"This should be a book that every consumer should read. What I find very interesting was that many of the techniques employed by sales people or con artist that was used on me was discribed step by step in this book. Though I didn't fall for them back then, it was eye opening to see 'their' textbook on persuading you.Most of the information and studies in this book are quite old. But nonetheless it is still revelant today. This most fascinating part for me was how retail stores and supermarkets showcases their merchandise. Or how simply by putting a more expensive item next to the cheaper item will generate more sales on the cheaper item. Sounds simple, but it isn't, that is why companies spend so much money on marketing and research.More rational people will generally not fall for tricks illustrated in this book. But unfortunately, these tricks do work because there are enough irrational people out there that are susceptible to them."
5,"Excellent- Necessary Reading For Anyone Who ""Buys"" Anything","As Mark Helprin noted in ""Monday"" in _The Pacific and Other Stories_, we've become a nation of advantage-takers, where someone who doesn't squeeze every penny out of his mark is himself a sucker. In Levine's superb book, he helps the reader arm him- or herself with knowledge of some of the strategies and tactics purveyors of all sorts of things - from consumer goods to salvation - use against those of us who assume we're walking into such situations evenly matched. As someone who has spent his career in corporate procurement (and who wrote his thesis on advertising) I can attest that Levine is spot on with his cautionary analyses. Read this book carefully and pass it along to others, especially the young who may not have built up their defenses against some of the tactics described herein. If nothing else, at least you will recognize what game is being played with you when it happens."
4,"Good book, but...","...my only complaint is that it is strikingly similar to 'Influence' by Cialdini (which is excellent and, of course, a classic). Too many examples from that book also appear here. If you haven't read 'Influence', however, you are likely to enjoy ""The Power of Persuasion"" much more than I did. In either case, you can consider this book as an investment, since you won't be an easy prey for advertisement manipulations anymore. And if you think you are not gullible to ad claims, you are the perfect victim and should definitely read either book."
5,Great book,"Easy to read. Lots of new material. Doesn't have a sales focus but is still a must for every salesperson.An academic who doesn't try and impress you with who he is. This is a fine book. Along with Hogan's The Psychology of Persuasion, this is one of the best.DT"
3,Become more aware of salesmen,"Levine explores persuasion in a very interesting and easy to read book. He begins by saying that everyone of us is persuaded to do, buy, believe, everything you can imagine all the time. Although this sounds pretty obvious for many of us, he analyzes the processes involved in persuasion. For example, who do we trust more?: a so called ""expert"" who we don't understand what's he's talking about? or someone who seems ""likeable"" to us?There are many examples like this (developed more thoroughly of course). He finally explains the limits of persuasion and mind control techniques that can be found in some religious sects."
1,The fps is BS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I took this gun to a local air soft store and it chronoed at 80 fps with .2s. This gun is good for nothing in an actual game and the accuracy is Horrible. It will shoot straight one shot then shoot way off to the right or left next shot. It would acutely be funny if I didn't pay money for this. Either my gun is defective or this is probably the worst air soft gun you can buy.
3,Last MFU novel is another OK Peter Leslie effort,"According to ""The U.N.C.L.E. Tribute Book"", the series of Man from U.N.C.L.E. novels was still being published by Ace Books until 1971. The last book _should_ have been David McDaniel's famous (in fannish circles) ""The Final Affair"", but Ace cut the series off at number 23. It's an OK but not altogether satisfying end to the series.Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin go to the south of France to investigate a series of mysterious, deadly crashes that have been destroying airliner after airliner and killing hundreds of people. As a fourth-season episode, it would actually probably have been rather good; the perhaps-overly-serious tone of the book matches the tone of that season quite well."
1,Needs expert peer review,"Be carefull relying on only this book for studying, I have found errors both factual and typing in mainly (but not limited to) the Review Questions sections."
1,I NEVER GOT IT,"I'm sure that the book would have been great considering I REALLY want to learn Urdu, but the book never showed up. :-( That's upsetting!"
1,Didnt like this easel,"I bought 2 different easels this Christmas for my 7 and 8 year old. One was $29.99, and worked great. Chalkboard worked very well....the other was this little tykes one. Though I like the extra storage space, my daughter kept using her brothers because the chalkboard on this one was very scratchy and didnt write nice. I am takin it back and getting the one that was half the price. Being a Little Tykes I thought it would be great, but ours wasnt...."
1,Chalkboard? Where???,"Why call one side a chalk board when chalk doesn't work on it?! We used a baby wipe to take the marks off that we made by pressing REALLY HARD, but then it left trace where we scribbled. Also, there were dots of paint and glue from the manufacturer on the chalkboard side as well. This was out of the box for only 5 minutes. We are definately returning it. Not the usual quality from Little Tikes."
1,very bad quality,got this as a christmas gift and was so disappointed in the quality of the chalk board - the chalk just doesn't write on it and we have tried all different kinds of chalk. i think this came from walmart and they may get a lesser quality product. with no box and no receipt i guess we are stuck with it - not happy about that.
2,The Collapsable Easel,"My son received this easel as a Christmas present. He played with it for about an hour before it came crashing down on him. The reason for the collapse is because of the way the easel is constructed. Four little wooden dowels hold the tray in place. This tray keeps the easel in the upright ""A"" stance. However, a little pressure on the tray and the little wooden dowels break causing the tray to fall which then causes the easel to collapse. We took it back and bought the less expensive Crayola Double Easel. This product has large plastic arms that lock in place. The trays have nothing to do with the easel keeping it's stance. So far we are very happy with this alternative product."
3,Not worth it!,"My 3 year old daughter got this easel for Christmas. It came with no dry-erase markers or chalk (which is fine) BUT... I first bought cheap dry erase markers (considering they don't always get the lids back on tight!) but they didn't erase with the ""standard"" eraser that I purchased... so I bought the expensive EXPO dry erase markers... they don't erase with the eraser... so everytime my daughter is finished with her drawing I have to get the EXPO spray and spray down the board, wipe it with a paper towel and they she has to wait for it to dry to start over. The chalk doesn't seem to write very well on the chalk board either. I picked this product based on the fact that the wood easels look better than the plastic easels, but it wasn't worth the money. I expected better."
3,Pretty Good Album,"I believe this was the first album I bought by Robert Plant. I've always thought it was funny that I've never been a Led Zeppelin fan, but I like a lot of Plant's solo stuff. This album is quite a departure from the first solo effort. It's got an atmospheric progressive touch melded with traditional rock. I also like the way he uses keyboards also. ""Thru With the Two Step"" has a nice sound to it, but the best tunes are ""Other Arms,"" ""In the Mood,"" and the classic ""Big Log."" ""Big Log"" has always been a great song, and is also very emotional. Good album."
5,Same great voice,"I loved Robert Plant in Zepplin and love this style music even more. I especially love the slower and more mellow songs. Love Big Log and In the Mood. Yes, I used love twice and loved once. If you like RP, this CD is worth buying."
5,another great solo effort!,"Robert Plant just keeps getting better with every project he does, i will always be a Plant fan for his dedication and presentation of his majestic music"
2,"""Not his best effort""","This was Plant's 2nd solo album and in my mind a concentrated effort not to sound like Led Zep which is maybe why the album is so lackluster. There are two very good songs here in ""Thru with the 2 Step"" and the album's best song, ""Big Log"". In both of these songs the vocals, music, and emotion all mesh well together. Most of the rest of the album sounds too restrained and the guitars sound thin and wimpy. I used to listen to this album quite a bit back in the day but it just doesn't hold up well now days."
3,PLANT IN A MINIMALIST MOOD,"The title and cover say it all. And the reviews here are all accurate in describing the album. Plant's second solo album sees him largely trying to get away from the Zep sound, and deconstructing the heavy riffs. ""Big Log"" was a big surprise at the time with its (if you saw it) existentialist video. This was the guy that sang in Led Zep? People were surprised. But Big Log and In the Mood have indeed as one reviewer puts it below, become Plant melancholy classics. The main criticism with this album is that the instrumentation is deliberately sparse and sometimes mechanical. But hats off to Plant for trying something different here, and succeeding in parts. Anyone buying this album will probably have a few favourite songs from it, but as an album in entirety - it's a bit too minimalistic!"
2,Principle of Moments,"The one song ""Big Log"" which should be called ""On the Road"" is excellent. The other songs in this collection are all second rate."
1,"Big Log, indeed","A Log Drop shall be forthcoming when listening to this CD. A ""Big Log"", in fact. Choose another selection, but not in the Robert Plant section, please."
3,Make Spyro Gyra seem like Coltrane,"This is a very nice CD, for sure, but does it ever get formulaic fast, the way Spyro Gyra never did.Each tune starts with a slow feeler to set a tentative mood. Then we're into an underlay of completely uninteresting drums and percussion -- what passes for ""funky"" now -- soon overlayed by snippets of Andreas Vollenweider-like woodwinds, guitar, and keyboards. These are choked back to the point of asphyxiation so that things never get too interesting. Everything is held at a monotonous ""family room"" tempo with a break two-thirds through each track so we don't fall asleep.Sorry, but this is music to discuss what happened at work today by, or read a novel by. Kenny G meets Whitney Houston, without the singing. None of it is memorable.I still whistle Spyro Gyra licks that have stuck in my brain from 20 years ago. There's nothing wrong with the genre, man. It's just the careful milking of the schtick that gets tiring."
5,Ziggi and the raggaie revival.,"As a crazy raggaie fan from Australia, Ziggi live is what i want to witness. Any one who knows where Ziggi Marley is performing in August 1999 let me know by return email and i will be there.. Thankyou...Honeyjack@hotmail.com"
4,Serious reggae CD,"This is definitely the spirit. ""Tumbling Down"" and ""Tomorrow People"" are the two stars from this collection, but overall it's a very positive and enjoyable CD. I came late to Ziggy Marley fandom, so have worked my way back to this CD. I can tell the band's grown from here, but this is still a fresh and fun sound."
1,Awful Pencil,This pencil is perhaps the worst i have ever used. the lead breaks so easily that i constantly have to pump out more and there is no tension on the lead so you have to hold the pencil flat for it to come out or else the whole piece falls out. I would recommend spending the extra money and getting a quality mechanical pencil or just using an old fashioned one
2,ARGH! Lead always pushes up!!,"The one BIG problem with these pencils is that if you put any pressure on the lead, it goes back up forcing you to have to click constantly. I don't think I put excess pressure on the pencil (the lead doesn't break), but I'm having to constantly click to bring the lead back down because it keeps pushing back up. Frustrating!!!I would try another product, I wouldn't buy these again."
4,Still Better than PaperMate,"So far, there isn't a ""great"" low-price mechanical pencil, but these are probably the best in this category. They last a long time, the lead is fairly high-quality, and the erasers work well. I recently purchased PaperMate's version and was sorely disappointed with erasers and leads falling out and the lead breaking constantly, so I promptly went back to Bic. To be fair, the complaints here about slipping leads are accurate, so don't expect perfection, but at this price point, Bic is still the best."
2,Too Expensive!,"Thought this was a good buy for my grandson who loves mechanical pencils. However, I could have bought this cheaper at Target!"
5,Great for School,I purchased these for school and was very impressed with both their quality and their price. They have lasted me an entire semester without breaking; and I paid as much for them as I would generic brand mechanical pencils.
5,Love love love Click Clack,"I have purchased many sizes of click clack, tall, short, wide, skinny. They keep items fresh wonderfully. The wider ones hold the large Costco bagels, so they stay fresh longer (probably two days longer as bagels do get stale quickly). We store nuts in them, fishy crackers, cereal, coffee....the list goes on as I find new uses all the time. I can stack two very nicely on the kitchen counter. The lids come apart nicely for cleaning. It takes a little finesse getting the plastic cover off the inside of the lid (and it's not always necessary to wash that part depending on what has been stored). I have to admit that I do use a small DULL screwdriver to wedge under the inside of the lid just enough so that I can pull the rest of it off, then you can rinse the top part as needed."
4,Sheer sensation,"This album hits the sensitive string inside me. All songs are about broken relations or unanswered love. And the voice of Max Werner is just very good. But ofcourse, there are some songs without these thoughts. Let's have a closer look at the album:Close To The Fire: 9/10 The title track, very goodWhen Hearts Grow Cold: 9/10 Very sad emotional songDream Child: 8/10 Good as wellFrozen Flame: 8/10 Nice, nice melody, and well sungForever: 9/10 Another good song, this one reminds me to the earlier KayakWorlds Apart: 7/10 good songCrusader: 9/10 nice melody, very goodTwo Wrongs (don't make a right): 6/10 the worst of the album, but not badAnybody's Child: 9/10 this is a classicHere Today: 8/10 Just well doneJust A Matter Of Time: 8/10 nice song, perfect for happy timesFull Circle: 10/10 the best of 'em all, great drum solo'sRuthless Queen: 9/10 a 10 for the song, a -1 for the one who sings itThat was my review, I highly recommend it to you!keep On Rocking!!!!"
3,Not bad for the price,This book provides a basic easy to read version of the greek myths that is fun to read but is clearly aimed at at younger audience. I also found that certain stories seemed to just pop up for a paragraph inserted among another tale altogether and seemed a little glossed over such as the tale of Arachne. Still for the price this is by no means a bad book and would make a good introduction for younger readers.
4,Great for a Greek mythology novice,"Having visited Greece and not being able to fully take in the mythology side of their history, I decided to buy this book. I found it easy to read, and though I still don't have all the Greek gods & goddesses names down pat, I have a much better knowledge of who is whom and what they did. Definitely one for those that want to get into mythology."
3,Good intro to Greek legend,"Basic stories about ancient greek stories. Nothing special. Nice cover but the story is very basic. It is okay, but not great."
4,Great read,Great for kids to understand written with great detail but clear and simple language. It was engaging and exciting without being too scary or abstract and gave a good sound knowledge of the ancient tales.
5,My son loves the book!,My son absolutely loves the book! Received in excellent condition and delivered timely! Many thanks!
1,Tales of the Greek Heroes: Retold From the Ancient Authors (Puffin Classics),Green is deeply knowledgable of the myths-scholarly so- yet he presents same with simple clarity and I-want-to-know-what-happens-next suspence. Superb introductions to the myths for younger first-time myth readers. Behind the action suspence looms the enormous meanings of the archtypes which are implanted for memories' later work of 'reminding' the understanding as life experiences reflect them.Orders the myths for further ease of understanding.
2,"Good on concepts, lacking on examples","With high hopes, I bought this book. But it has been a big disappointment. The book explains the concepts of OLE DB templates and the various macros, quite well. Lot of figures explaining the relationship between objects. But it is very much lacking on real usable examples. There is not a single complete example. Most examples are real simple. Inserts and Deletes get just one page each, hardly useful, and also the example used for these is with a CTable. How many people use a CTable for inserts and deletes? It is like saying ""Delete/Update the first row in the database"", which is hardly practical. There are about 30 OLE DB types, but no examples on how to use these. In summary, the book is better than the SDK documentation on OLE DB templates, but not much useful if you want to get into OLE DB programming quickly."
2,Almost ok - READ THIS,"As you can see, there are not many books on the subject. However, this book contains very few code lines and it is not organized well. The fact that a programming book does not have even 1 (!) full example can't be good. You will get a fair amount of information from this book; however, YOU WILL visit MSDN regularly. The author spend time on known subjects like performance again and again (although that C++ programmers are well aware to this subject) and less to the whole concept of the templates. He is breaking up all the objects very well, but failing terribly in providing the whole system. A ""nice to have"" book as a second or third reference. Don't buy it as first."
4,an excellent treatment of a complicated subject,"The current dean of Boston historians, Thomas O'Connor writes with a definite passion for his subject matter. O'Connnor deftly navigates the various personalities and political administrations that brought about the redevelopment of ""The Athens of America."" O'Connor adds touches that only a local with his experience could. Highly recommended"
4,/a victim's view,"As a victim of this great renaissance, I have a less golden view of this destruction of neighborhoods and disruptions of thousands of lives that turned Boston into a yuppie paradise by displacing more traditional residents. A black mark in Boston history fraught with racism and antisemitism. don't let the golden words fool you."
3,Tap Tap Dee Dah!,"This is a very challenging DVD. The choreography is not the hard part, the presentation is. Jared shows you the steps a few times but he doesn't really tell you the steps so you have to watch his feet and it is hard to pick up the steps. I will keep working at it but it is not easy to learn it. I would recommend the Shim Sham Shimmy with Leonard Reed or Bonnie Franklin's I Hate to Exercise but Love to Tap DVDs instead of this one."
5,Miracle Cream,I get horribly dry cracked hands in the winter. I finally bought some cotton gloves and this cream and wore them for the first time last night. A HUGE improvement in my hands after just one night. I highly recommend this cream!!
2,It may have been mistaken,"The novel was in very great condition, except that excuse me if i may sound rude, but i don't think the picture for this item should be the manga, because it completely mistaked me for the book shown and not the book i got in the mail. i read the bold writing, and was certain it was not the book i ordered. I may have been the one being mistaken but i still was not satisfied when i did not get the book i was expecting."
2,Not outstanding,"The workbook itself is not bad, although it could have been more imaginative. I did not like the second half of each letter page being a simple tracing exercise.The CD-ROM learning game was a disappointment. The games section of the program is very confusing. My 5 year old tried a few times and could not get the hang of it. He is not interested. The ""movies"" are not animated, they are puppet shows with music. There are much better learning materials out there."
5,Great!,"Sailor Moon Classic! In great condition and always entertaining, hard to believe it's been twenty years! Highly recommended to any anime/manga fan."
4,It's OK {I think...Perhaps Akia has gotten to me...},"Well, overall it was a good manga, but seriously, I wasn't as engrossed as with all the other ones {ie, SuperS #4} It IS more expensive than the singles comics, but it's more durable and has extras! *^_^* Anyways, bye!"
3,not a how-to-book,"An interesting book. As mentioned in one of the previous reviews, if you are looking for a how-to book, this is not it. This book is more of an account of one person's experiences in the out of body, specifically, what one can expect when one passes over to the 'other side'. It is a little different from other books of the same genre because, again, it has the author's bias and interpretation. It has more symbolisms than some of the other books. Perhaps this make it more easy to understand what is going on. But for me, I felt that there were too much symbolism to make it believable. It is however an interesting book to read but for me it is not an essential book for my library collection. I would give this book 3 stars."
3,83 hours,"In 1968, twenty year old Barbara Jane Mackle was kidnapped from a hotel room she was staying in with her mom. Two individuals, took her into the Georgia woods and buried her in a coffin-like box. Although she was told they would check on her every two hours, she was left utterly alone for eighty-three hours. At her parents house in Florida, her father received a ransom call, demanding $500,000.00 in unmarked twenty dollar bills.I found the first half of this book riveting. I was unable to put it down until Barbara was rescued and restored to her parents. I found the search for her kidnappers and their trials to be a bit anti-climatic after the action-packed beginning. Overall, I enjoyed the book and reading about a historical kidnapping."
1,Save your money,They need to make this clip a bit larger to even come close to fitting like it shows in the picture. Piece of junk.
3,Satyri-flat,"Okay, what can be said about this, the latest piece of musical darkness spat from the decrepit bowels of Satyricon... in a word - flat. The mix has a surprising lack of impact or pulse. If I were Frost I'd assault Satyr for his pompous and neglecting mix. Songs that have the potential to be totally black, of only Satyr would suck it up and buy a black metal distortion pedal instead of using that awful, Korn style fuzz box, and if only he would crank the guitars up and crank the drums up, because at the moment it reminds me of something played through a soggy tissue box.Ranting aside, this is a great album, it has all the elements required of a great black metal recording, it just has a painful mix. The lack of darkness and heaviness has seen Satyricon all but ejected from the black metal world, but I appeal to you to give this album a second chance... it's all just a big misunderstanding..."
5,Something like flying,"Listening to this cd is as easy as breathing. Turn it on and suddenly you are alive, suddenly you have ancestral memory, suddenly you are soaring through the tree tops like you did forty thousand years ago, like you were meant to do. Get this CD"
4,Nice...,"The Survival section is funny, but takes up a small part of the book. Most of the book deals with the history and background of the Daleks. A very detailed section of Dalek types and Dalek Special types, but much of the information in the book is available from other sources, both books and websites.Nice to add to one's collection. A cool gift for a Dr.WHO? fan and cheap to boot."
5,THE DALEK SURVIVAL GUIDE BOOK IT WAS SO GOOD!!!!,The Dalek Survival Guide rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it is a very small bookI do like the daleks it is very rare!! book.age 10MarkThomann
4,Super Reader,"The second Waylander book is in reality a little more about his adopted daughter Miriel.Karnak and others decide to dispose of Waylander the Slayer, and send assassins and men to kill him. A mistake, as he has trained his daughter well, and two other warriors end up fighting with him.Thrown into the mix are a Nadir shaman and his plans for the coming of the Uniter of the tribes.Everyone must also worry about the Dark Brotherhood."
5,Love these....,"I love these and first purchased at [...]. I don't know why [...] stopped carrying them. I'm crushed. My daughter would take to school for healthy snacks. And I would have one at work with my coffee for something sweet in the morning. I love that it is only 60 calories and all natural ingredients. Hopefully, I can find them locally otherwise I'll just purchase here. I'm so glad to find them on Amazon.com. I was afraid they were gone forever."
5,Great new group,"Three Men and a Tenor (Paul, Chuck, Mark, and Glenn) is a refreshing, new group. They bring a new sound and interpretation to some great old classics, like ""Big Bad John"", ""We Three"", and many more. The CD, ""Listen To the Music"" is enhanced, and for those of you with PC's, you can see the group biographies, photos, and performances of ""It's You"", and ""They Are There"". This is A Cappella singing at it's best, enhanced with some rhythm instruments like tamborine to add a bit of spice to their performance. Highly recommend this album and group."
5,totally intense!,"i've been using the carmen electra dvd 2, and let me tell you mel b blows it outta the water! i love the set up menu so you can pick and choose the target area and the order you would like to work out in. i also like that she has a warm up section and a cool down section to do at the end of your work out. mel b is very in your face and gives you a bit of inspiration, versus the quite carmen electra.today is only my second day using the dvd and i believe it is gong to take me at least a month to build up into, but if this doesn't get me totally fit, then nothind out there will! i'm excited!"
4,I was hoping for better!,"I was really hoping to love this dvd based on others reviews, but I was kind of disappointed. As others pointed out the camera angles are distracting but you can deal with it. The 1 minute intervals she uses for the exercises actually seem to take a long time! The minute really seems to drag on some of these exercises. It would be better if she broke it down to 30 second intervals and introduced more variety of exercises. Overall, you do get a good workout, but I was hoping for a more exciting workout-something that would keep me pumped up."
3,Mel B's Form is Terrible,"But the skinny blonde girl in the back seems to have decent form throughout. Just follow her. Otherwise, a nice workout!"
2,Not for beginners,"I feel that you need to be ""totally fit"" in order to do this workout. Mel B gives no instruction on form and there is very little modification (one woman does not use ""weights"" during the arm section) to the exercises. Also, the exercises are done at a very fast pace and I'm not entirely sure that this is effective for anything other than the cardio sections. Advanced exercises may enjoy the fast pace but those looking for instruction and exercises that build upon each other should look elsewhere."
3,"Just okay...not good, but not bad either","I thought this workout was just okay. It wasn't amazing, but it wasn't terrible either.It did take me a while to start sweating though. Some of the moves did nothing for me, while others really worked those specific areas. I like Mel B as an instructor though; she's funny and actually seems real. She does the entire workout with you, which was nice to see. I also like that she uses water and soup as hand weights, showing the viewers that you can workout with what you have, and you don't necessarily need actual weights to workout."
4,"Totally burns, but a bit boring","The workout led by the vivacious Mel B is a burner. It works the muscles in your arms, legs, and abs with repitition of weights. Which is great. It's what I want, but it can get boring fast because the repitions are a minute long. Doing lateral raises for one whole minute works the arms and it also tests my patience. If I didn't feel so good and burn so many calories after the workout I'd probably not do it.Also, it helps that Mel B is so peppy yet not annoying. She's like your fun friend you go to the gym with who works hard and moans n' groans with you."
3,Oow and Wow,"Love the dvd, Mel is hilarious! The work outs are fun and not too lengthy. Have yet to determine if they are doing any good. Only time will tell. I will give it a month and get back to you."
1,Inappropriate if you have children in the room,"I did like the workouts, but after doing it a few times I started realizing that a lot of the camera angles are focused on her chest, stomach, and between legs (I'm trying to put it nicely). I quickly began to feel uncomfortable putting this video on in front of my children because it's clear this is also meant to be used for adult ""entertainment"". I ended up throwing it in the trash. If you want something more family friendly, any of the jillian videos give a great workout and can be viewed by anyone in the family."
1,NO DVD CAME,Well over a month and no DVD.No replies to emails either.DO NOT order from this seller!! No refund yet either.This is awful.AND I am in NY too.No excuse!
3,I like Mel B.,This is a pretty good dvd. I like that Mel B. is down to earth and lets you know that all of the exercises are not easy for her. She seems like she's in it with you. She's very pleasant and likeable. I dislike that Mel doesn't really identify the moves or explain how they should be done in proper form (sometimes she doesn't appear to have the proper form herself!). He cueing is off so sometimes she was a few reps into a move before I realized what she was doing. I guess repeated viewing will remedy that.
5,Great DVD,"You can tell Mel B. is not a professional exercise instructor. This is just something all celebrities are taking on. This I will tell you, she does kick your butt in this dvd. It is very intense and you will feel the burn and lose weight. You just need to do this dvd (3) times a week. I am very please with this dvd. I was doing the insanity dvd with Shaun T and I have to tell you, I did the first month and it was very hard on my joints. I quit because I was starting to injure myself. I gave Totally Fit 5 stars because it gets the job done and Mel B. has a great sense of humor."
2,too fast,Great exercises but performed way to fast for a beginner and there are no modifiers. Recipes are good. Non stop
4,"So fun, love Mel B","Rating this a four only because I previously had the deluxe version with bonus ab and back workouts, which I miss. If you can find the deluxe version spring for that (and let me know where you found it). I love this DVD, it's super easy to use to create exactly the workout you want to do. It's easy enough that it's not too intimidating to get started, but not too easy that it's not a good work out. You can adapt it to increase the intensity with more weight or modifications to the moves. Mel B was always my favorite Spice Girl too, so it is just a blast to be working out with her, she makes it fun. The length is also good, you can do just one routine if you are in a hurry, or the whole DVD if you are really pumped. Also, if you are deciding between this and ""Get Fit With Mel B"" for Playstation Move, definitely get this DVD. The PS3 game is boring, and too easy and not very accurate."
2,great idea--poor quality,"We purchased this item for our new guinea pig. I liked the idea that it was portable, foldable, and big enough to give him extra space. The problem is that the connecting slots that hold the playpen together broke almost immediately. The metal was way too soft so our playpen is now held together by a series of twist ties. This makes it difficult to fold and store so my children can no longer set up the playpen by themselves."
3,The mats i received were not perfect matches,I ordered two of these and one mat was much brighter blue and white. The other mat had either been sitting in the sun or was from a different dye lot.Still-they were super cheap and not worth returning as they will just be stepped all over any how.Just wanted to warn anyone who is buying for looks over utility.
4,Fun gadget,These are fun little gadgets. I only tried them once before I wrapped them all up as xmas gifts. So far I have good reviews from the various 3-6 year olds they went out to.
3,Cute but . . .,"I love gadgets and these were cute and very well made. However, onceI saw them in action, I realized they would have a very limited appealto the people for whom they were purchased and returned them."
4,Looked boring compared to other Kikkerland - it was one of our favorites!,After looking at all the Kikkerland toys. We bought at least two of each for Christmas stocking stuffers. Out of all of them this was one of the best.
5,Fun Sparks!,"This is a fun, cute, easy to use and entertaining wind up toy. I bought it for a 9 yr old but I can see many kids older and younger loving this just to have around. It looks cool sitting on a shelf or sparking while it's being played with. I think it is awesome for creative thinkers - not expecting everything that winds and moves to represent an animal or person - outside the box, to be cliche. =)"
2,"Luck of the draw, I guess.","My son (9) saw this in a store and LOVED it. I purchased one as a stocking stuffer, and thank goodness I decided to try it out because it doesn't spark at all! Ok, it gave off a few sad little sparks, but nothing like what we first saw. Definitely try it out before giving as a gift. I'm returning this and trying again because he really liked it... but I'm definitely keeping the receipt on hand."
3,Sparks Fly,Our grandson was SO EXCITED about this toy and couldn't wait for it to arrive. It was great fun for a few week and the the tension went out of it. It couldn't hold the tension after wound to make it operate. Was thrown ou a while ago
5,'' CLASSIC METAL '' !!,"ALTHOUGH THESE GUYS ARE STILL AROUND TODAY , ONLY A FEW OF THEIR RELEASES ARE CLASSICS. THEIR DEBUT OF COURSE, AND THIS CD AS WELL!EVEN THOUGH THE PRODUCTION IS A BIT WEAK , THE CD IS STILL VERY GOOD!THEY MANAGE TO BLEND AMAZING GUITAR WORK , INCREDIBLE VOCALS, AND KEYBOARDS TO MAKE ONE HELL OF A RECORD!! ALL OF THE SONGS ARE DONE SO GOOD THAT YOU'LL BE PLAYING AIR GUITAR AND SINGING ALONG TO YOUR NEIGHBOR'S REGRET..THEIR IS NOT ONE WEAK OR LAME TRACK ON THE CD.AND THE BONUS SONGS ARE GREAT TOO, WHICH ARE TAKEN FROM THEIR E/P CALLED '' WAITING FOR THE NIGHT ''..ANOTHER GOOD RECORD OF THEIR IS CALLED '' NOBLE SAVAGE '' !SO GET A BAND OF A BYGONE ERA, WHEN TALENT WAS FEW AND FAR BETWEEN.THESE GUYR ARE UNIQUE, ORIGINAL, AND REFRESHING!!LONG LIVE CLASSIC METAL!!"
4,"Good for traveling, but a spring winder is lacking","The Kensington Winder is a good product for keeping the power cable neatly compact. The Winder easily replaces the folder cable that is included in the Kensington travel adapters. Its size matches closely to the Kensington adapter, allowing it to fit into the travel bag along side the adapter.The winder is manually powered, and I find it unwinding in the travel bag. It is not becoming completely unwound, just enough to annoy me. A spring mechanism to wind and keep the cord under tension would make this the ideal travel companion.(T)Hank(s)"
3,Works okay,"The winder is sort of bulky, so this didn't turn out to be the weight and space saver that I was hoping for"
1,"Nice idea, poorly executed","This cable winder is one of the main reason I went with the Kensington adapter. It's a great idea, but unfortunately it is made so cheaply that after less than a couple of months it just doesn't work anymore as the mechanism that winds the cable back is shot."
2,Does Not Work with 120W Ultra Portable Power Adapter,"Key Point: This retractable cable does NOT work with K33197 120W Auto/Air Ultra Portable Notebook PC Power Adapter with which it is featured on Amazon.Reason: The tips have small tabs on top and bottom that fit into groves on the cable ends. On the retractable cable, the ends lack this grove on the bottom, preventing connection.Pros: Compact size and light weight. I recommend it to anyone that travels with size and weight constraints. Just be ready to return it if the the tips don't work with your Kennsington power adaptor model.Major disappointment with Amazon for combining incompatable products."
5,One more time,"This is one of those rare cds that I can listen to for days at a time and not get tired or annoyed. There is quite the musical mix and yet Kris's voice is constantly blending in perfectly as it floats over the music. This cd has it all: upbeat 'bluegrassy' songs such as ""Bobby Lee"", ""East of The Mountains"", ""Come Home"" and ""Short Work"". It has slow, jazzy songs ""Waiting Under the Waves"" and ""Juice+June"". Then there are the more 'rocky' songs ""Wasted Word"", ""Weathervane"". And of course, my personal favorites, the sad, mellow songs that really allow Kris's vocals to shine ""Too Late"", ""You're No Train"", and ""Mingalay"". ""Hummingbird"" is one of the most beautiful songs I have EVER heard and it is my favorite of this cd. I can get lost in this music and that is a good thing. Kris has a unique and soulful voice that can put me to sleep or get me excited to be alive. I love this cd and highly recommend it to all!!"
3,Not really for beginners,"I was a bit disappointed with this book. I followed many of the instructions to the tee as best as I could understand the ""language"" and it was difficult to follow. Not to mention, you had best know where all the tools are before embarking on the lessons. I can see this becoming a great reference book as I become more developed with CS2, but for a beginner I would not recommend it."
4,Poetic Aid,"This book is rather basic, but it is a good book. If you are new to poetry or need to write a paper about a poem and know nothing about poetry, this book willbe a tremendous aid to you."
5,great aussie rock,"This is a really enjoyable album. Kind of psychadelic pop I guess. Though a bit more rocky? Not a track I dont like. If you want to hear some great aussie rock on the up and up, you cant go past this little number."
3,zpg,"even though this film predates Logans Run and THX 1138 it still is a thoughtful and well done film for it's small budget. No matter what people say it's great to see any film with Oliver Reed in it. An actor who wasn't well known in the states. Oliver makes it worth watching. Now if only somebody would release ""THESE ARE THE DAMNED"" and ""HANNEBAL BROOKS"" you would make my day."
3,It was an ok movie,I thought it was a pretty good movie. It showed what it would be like it the world was over-populated and they had to take drastic measures to stop the population growth.
2,zero population,"This was not the dvd I thought when I ordered it. This was too much of a futuristic point of view where the earth was going to be in horrible shape in the 21st century because of overpopulation. The one I was hoping for dealt with people over a certain age not being given any medical help, and families limited to 1 child.I'm not into futuristic movies."
4,ZPG,"A movie that is ahead of it's time and like most of the Sci-Fi Utopia style movies like ""Logan's Run"" this could stand a re-boot. Though the significant fall out in our currently charged atmosphere about abortion rights and the like would make this movie a hot topic button item for sure."
2,isn't compatible with most phones,this is not compatible with most phones - i thought it would have universal plug but it does not :-(
3,Shipped quickly,"The product came as ordered in a reasonable amount of time and the price is good, I am sure this is a discontinued product from sony-e.However, you have to order multiple ones, at least I always do, because they last only a few months before they stop working."
1,terribly flawed design,"This item seemed the perfect solution for someone who only needs ""hands-free"" operation while driving, without messing with the cost and/or hastle of bluetooth. But the design of the earpiece is hideous. I'm a 6 ft. tall man and the earpiece is not even close to fitting in my ear. It's huge! WAS IT DESIGNED FOR POLAR BEARS OR WHAT?I'm trashing it because I don't want to spend the time or money to return it.It's back to the drawing board for me."
1,Seemed like an infomercial,"In many ways, this book reads more as a promotional brochure than a how-to book. I am convinced that the authors are either founders of, or shareholders in, one of the ""opt-in"" email list providers that they constantly plug throughout the book. On a more tactical level, the book is squarely targeted at absolute beginners, and didn't provide the level of guidance that I had hoped for."
2,A book full of information but leaving little impression,"The book is full of information but it is hard to summarize. I found myself repeatedly trying to find useful operational information and only partially succeeding by crunching the text.In the chapter called "" Writing an E Mail Masterpiece"" the author's recommend that we look at Amazon's other 75 books on the subject since "" This is not the place to lay down the well-worn rules of business writing"" . Well if a chapter, so named, is not the place to learn the rules then why use such an inappropriate title. There are obvious sections in this book where the content is illuminating but,overall,the book lacked continuity and was disappointing."
2,Less than adequate,"Great title, but the substance of the book is lacking. It reads with the big powerful words of a direct marketer, but it reminded me of the direct mail I hate. Alot of power words, but nothing to really sink my teeth into.A book that is great for the person starting out is Make Your Website work for you. It's a basic book, but it gives a more robust program. There's also one about affiliate marketing and developing associations. I think both will help you better market online."
2,Kind of jumbled and unfocused,"If you have never had ANY experience with email (and I don't just mean marketing with it), then perhaps this book is for you. This book is way too beginner-oriented (although it promotes itself as if it has loftier things to say). But the worst thing about this book is that it is not well-organized and goes into things that, frankly, aren't important if you really want to market with email. It's too all over the place and unfocused."
2,Fila Brazillia - Saucy Joints,"I'm all for remixes, remakes, and reconceptualizations. On their Saucy Joints EP, however, Fila Brazillia do none of that and instead have Djinji Brown deliver some mediocre raps over some of their classic tracks. Thus ""Little Dipper"" just becomes ""Dipper"" and ""But Momma"" becomes just ""Momma."" The rap adds nothing to the track -- more than anything, they detract from the originals. So just stick with the originals. Saucy Joints just leave a bad taste in your mouth."
3,Good Construction Poor Packages,"Overall the toys were OK, Great idea and the toy itself has great construction. My issues were with the packaging. We ordered 28 of these toys total for Christmas stockings after watching the videos on the Kikkerland website. But almost everyone of them were falling out of their packaging when they arrived especially Le Pinch.The second issue was on their videos these toys seem to last 15-20 seconds or more at a time. When in person they only lasted about 3-5 seconds each time they were wound up."
2,misleading,The advertisement is misleading as one is made to belief that you will receive 3 different toys instead you receive 3 of the same kind. Very disappointing.
4,IT WAS PRETTY GOOD.,I LIKED THE BOOK BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN PRESCRIBED WELLBUTRIN SR FOR DEPRESSION. HOW LONG BEFORE IT WORKS? HOW DID YOU FEEL? HOW MUCH ARE YOU TAKING? AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU COULD SHARE ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH WELLBUTRIN.
4,OBSOLETE TECHNOLOGY,"Although I cannot find a bigger or better book on the subject matter, it is such a waste to devote about one third of the text to obsolete woods (actually clubs made with wood heads). These clubsare no longer used by any pro or serious amatures.I will wait for drastic revision or coverage by new authors."
5,"rich, haunting, moving","masterful playing, wonderful musicians, haunting, rootsy, jazzy, americana. I hear new things with every listen. highly recommended."
3,BLAH,"More ads than actual content. if you are in the market for accessories for your home this would be a great magazine for you. It is full of ads with websites. You might just save the $ and google the items you need. Some nice pictures, overall, not the best home magazine I have ever had."
5,sonicflood's awesome,"i've never really been into praise and worship music...i like rock mainly. but i love this cd, i can not stop listening to it. there aren't any bad songs on the cd and it's awesome to hear the band's thoughts on how God is working in their lives. if you're reading this and thinking of buying it, definately get this cd. it's amazing."
4,no bad songs,This is a good Cd that glorifies God. I'm not crazy about every song but I don't hate any. Holy One rocks and has a Third Eye Blind sorta twist. I Want To Know You and Refuge are cool too.
4,"kudos for passionate commitment, and one mammouth gem...","This CD has one musical gem and that's ""Refuge"". It begins with a liquid tremello guitar, and just builds, builds, builds until it's racing along in praise. The guitars absolutely sing, reminiscent of Johnny Greenwood's soaring work for Radiohead, and the hooks are ear-candy melting and almost painfully sweet. Unlike other worship music, Sonicflood understood that when it comes to lyrics, nobody can improve on the Word. These guys know how to engage the soul and mind in a dialogue with the Lord like few I've heard.If one band can contribute something truly moving to the thousand-year-old pantheon of voices lifted up on high, there should be great joy. I believe Sonicflood did it with ""Refuge"". What a pity the original band is no longer extant."
3,"Alot of Potential, Needs Some Work","This CD is excellent and full of energy--until they sing ""I Could Sing of Your Love Forever"". It kind of loses energy on that song, and never really picks up again after that. The songs after ""My Refuge"" (definitely the best cut on the CD) are all kind of what they said they didn't want to do--generic Christian praise and worship, consisting of acoustic guitars and mellow vocals. If they could keep the energy of the first few songs from start to finish, this would be five stars. However, I will look forward to future releases from Sonicflood in the hope they can keep the energy. I also strongly disagree with the man who called this ""Snoresville"". It's not bad at all. Meanwhile, check out the Insyderz' ""Skalleluia Too"". It's really good."
1,Random Christian guitar players who want to get famous,"This album contains mediocre covers of worship songs. Any group of decent musicians could have gotten together and produced this album. The renditions of the songs on this album are totally unoriginal.On I Have Come to Worship, I Want to Know You, and Open the Eyes of My Heart, I find the lead vocals to be extremely whiny and annoying. If you want a better version of The Heart of Worship, get the original by Matt Redman.I am not putting down this album simply because it's mostly covers. There are a couple of original songs on this album, but they all (...). The Passion worship CDs are also mostly covers, but they do the songs much better and they also have some really good original songs.I am an avid collector of worship music. I have about 60 worship CDs in my CD collection. This SonicFlood album is probably in my bottom 5% of worship CDs."
3,"Good CD, but not without problems.","Overall, a decent rock album. However, no matter how honest these guys are, I think they may have accidently caused people to look at worship in a way that's a bit off. First, worship is not an ""experience."" It is giving to God through all of our lives...in this case music. Maybe if these guys practiced that they wouldn't be on the verge on breaking up and kicking each other out of the band. Worship is not something something we do to ""get"" something from God. Finally, worship is not about us, it's about God. Worship is not a time to basically say ""gimme gimme gimme"" to God. However, the music is good and well written...although the song ""In The Secret"" is a dead ringer for Third Eye Blinds ""Semi Charmed Life."""
1,Major disappointment,"I'm a big fan of Christian music - I want my kids hearing the RIGHT stuff when they're listening, but this CD is ""snoresville"". Good thing they didn't try to crossover to the secular market to witness to nonChristians, 'cause no one except Youth ministers and youth groups would give this more than one hearing."
5,Fabulous album!,"It's totally refereshing to hear a Christian rock band that's music is still really focused on Christ, and not where the latest single is on the charts. Would recommend it to literally everyone."
5,SonicFlood,"If You Like Christian Rock/ Praise&Worship,You'll Love SonicFlood. You Will Be Singing To It All Day Long!"
3,Great music and wonderful praise songs,"I just got this cd and I think it is really good. I really like how they base their songs on God, and not things of this world. I really like ' Open the eyes of my heart' because it shows what we really should be seeking if we are Christians. The song ' I want to know You' is the same way, because it also shows what we should be seeking, or wanting. It has its fast and slow songs, but everything is really good.I would recomend this cd to everyone. It really puts God in your mind again."
5,I'd like to go to Melanie's youth group!,"I am so jealous of you, Melanie. But, that's ok because unlike you, I did buy the CD. It gave our youth group new ideas on how to play some of our favorite songs. This CD is truly a keeper."
5,This is a great worship CD with an awesome sound.,"Sonic Flood is one of my favorite CDs. If your looking for something to bring you to ""the heart of worship"", this is the CD for you. It has many of today's great worship songs; songs that will bring you into a state of worship no matter what your feeling. The words just carry you away. And although this is a great worship CD, it doesn't have that ""praise and worship"" kind of sound that you normally associate with that kind of music. Sonic Flood has a unique and amazing sound that is simply captivating. Great sounding music with a great message that can have an amazing impact on your life. It's AWESOME!!!"
5,This album will bring you closer to God,"This is the best Christian CD I've ever bought. It is music you can sing along with. Sonicflood is awesome, and I'll be first in line for their next CD. You can't help but to praise God with all your heart while listening to the music."
5,What a pleasant surprise!,"Okay, I admit that I'm probably quite a bit older than the average listener of this CD. Being a 40-something mom of 3 almost grown kids, I wasn't too sure about this new CD the youngest brought home (chosen at the Christian bookstore at random?!). My tastes usually run a bit mellower than I thought this album would be.I was really surprised. This is a truly awesome album and fills a much-needed niche for ""edgier"" but very heartfelt and sincere worship music that speaks to the hearts and souls of kids today.My favorite songs on this album are ""I Want to Know You More"", ""I Could Sing of Your Love Forever"", and lastly but perhaps my very favorite is ""Heart of Worship"". This song just says it all.If you love the Lord and want to worship Him more, you'll love this CD! Please check out my other reviews of Christian music and books."
3,Works great for larger parts,I used it to cut M15 threads and it worked good. It was hard to get the small amounts I needed out of it though. Press the button and the pressure in the bottle really delivers...
4,Great product,"For the price, the product is good quality.have some discolor at the soles.but overall I'm satisfied."
5,Fun and Captivating,"This CD is so much fun to listen to! It's Drama, romance and a few shenanigans thrown in. I can visualize what is going on as the story develops and can just escape with the music. I can't wait to see it in production!"
2,Don't bother,"This CD is totally not worth spending the money on. I hope it was just a recording made for fun--the lyrics alone are pretty horrible. The rhyme scheme is simplistic (e.g. ""He's Zorro! Zorro! Defending the poor with each blow! Each blow!"", and so on). It's a shame that some of the people on this CD wasted their talents on mediocre material."
4,A MUST FOR DEBORAH GIBSON FANS,"In all honesty I only purchased this CD because it featured Deborah Gibson. Having been a fan of Deborah's since way back, it was a must for me. Living in the UK we don't hear much about Deborah. It was only when browsing at [the internet] that I saw this CD and purchased it immediately. There are 5 songs featuring Deborah, all of which are excellent, although I am perhaps slightly biased. The only downside to this CD is that the bonus tracks (alternative versions of the brilliant ""What makes a hero"" and "" Now that I have you"" Produced by Tony Moran) are not performed by Deborah Gibson & Ruben Gomez. All in all this is an excellent listen and certainly a must for ALL Deborah Gibson fans."
2,bad,bla bla...i'll just say that it's really badddddd.2stars only for coldplay.yellow is amazing song but not this version.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY
1,what the???,"I admit, I can't help getting caught up in the the whole ""chill-out"" music craze.It just gets the best of me.But if this turkey is supposed to relax you, I'm sure a 50 cent cd would get me more ""chilled"" than this junk.Seriously, I give it credit for 3 good songs on the first disc, but that's about it.The rest is either really freaky sounding acoustic music (friday's dust is one example), or cheap little techno beats.The more chillout cd's I'm buying, the more I come to realize that it's just a trend waiting to burn out-personally, next time I wanna get ""chilled"", I'll pop in some mellow r n'b, or somethin' jazzy."
3,Another ULTRA release...,"Ok, if you've bought any of the other hundred or so comps by Ultra, then you know what to expect already. For the uninitiated that means that Disc 1 is pretty solid after one skips past the first three to five tracks. Now those tracks may not be that bad individually, but that's where all the 'big names' on the disc get collected, regardless of how well they happen to flow together. Disc 2 is where things always start to look better. Better tracks that tend to work side by side in a logical fashion that creates the groove that the producers were shooting for in the first place. And this comp does have some very solid tunes. Gotan Project, Jazzanova and Koop off Disc 1 and very nearly all of Disc 2 is just smashing. Pretty laid-back over-all with some mellow drums in the mix, but nothing too fierce for what it is. And finally a 'Chill' comp sans Moby. Not too shabby."
2,Worst money I've spent for awhile,"In the act of buying cd's we all take chances. Sometimes we will go and read as many customer reviews and play the safe road. Other times we will go off and purchase things on a whim... Sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. This is one of the cases where it was definitely a turn for the worst. I thought that seeing a couple artists on the album that I really enjoyed was hedging the bets a bit in my favor, but I couldn't be more wrong. The entire mix of music on either cd is disjointed, and uninspired. The song selection takes no chances and rides with the sappy ""downtempo"" stereotype of popular artists. The 'chilled' part is questionable when we start getting assaulted by clubland beats that seem to do exactly the opposite. Don't bother wasting your money on this product that boasts only a decent design and a pretty face."
4,"Magnificent stuff, this","If nothing else, this book single-handedly shatters all the images of the micro-managing meddler that Groucho has been painted as over the years. We are given a look behind the scenes at one of the most brilliant radio and television game shows ever produced, and we see Groucho not only as a genius at the art of ad-libbing, but also of allowing a talented staff to explore their own creativity.I would compare this to ""Letters From Groucho"" only because it made me laugh until tears were rolling down my cheeks; otherwise, it is a unique book, the only one I've read on this witty man that chips away the stereotypes by someone who actually knew and worked with him."
2,Groucho made boring,"This book, while no doubt being historically accurate, manges to turn the life of one of our most colorful personalities into a complete bore. It is nothing more than an encylopedic listing of one fact after another. Somehow he has managed to include almost all of the unfunny interviews with contestants in the book and omit the great ones. Anybody who reads this book and had never seen the show would surely wonder why we all enjoyed it so muh"
4,Good book!,This was a pretty good book! I especially like the story of the young Russian man (it's been months since I read it...I forget his name). While not really a Titanic book it is an accurate account of the times and these men share their melancholy lives with us.
4,Ya gotta love Hamish!,"It's Christmas, and Hamish is sick. The unlikable Jane Wetherby from the island of Eileencraig thinks someone's trying to kill her. She runs a health farm, where lots of interesting characters are staying, all of whom, of course, become suspects in what leads to murder. DEATH OF A SNOB may be the 4th in the Hamish Macbeth series -- I've lost count. It's coprighted 1991. The awkward relationship between Hamish and Priscilla contines. This is a real cozy in the old tradition, with a group brought together on an island. It's fun, short, and light, but also moody and dark, with some elements of a real ""thriller"" thrown in, along with some fun characters. Once again, Beaton has made the nasty one so nasty that I'd have wanted to kill that one myself!"
2,Death of a snob,I stopped reading the Hamish Macbeth series because i do not care for swearing. I thought I would be entertained but instead I was offended. Enough said.
2,just sucked,as a math textbook which should explain easily mathematical problems it was horrible thou gh noted this book is better than the authors more advanced text books. so if u need for a classs buy it if not than dont waste ur money.
1,NEVER AGAIN,I had a very hard time with this order. I never received my books and still ended up spending double because I still had to photocopy the book at school.The seller wasn't help at all very unprofessional. I will never order anything from here again---- a terrible experience!!!!!!!!
3,A good offering from a master turntablist,"Rob Swift, DJ extraodinare from the X-ecutioners, gives us the latest in turntablism. Even though I was expecting more instrumentals, I wasn't really disappointed since the MCs that come show up go well with Mr. Swifts tight production skills- speaking of which, the MC best track, in my opinion is ""I'm Leaving"", which has one of the dopest guitar loop I've ever heard ( which perfectly compliments the somewhat melancholy subject of leaving your girl ), too bad it's only two and some odd minutes long. Other highlights are ""all that scratching is making me rich"", which is him on the ones and twos and various others on drums, guitar, and horns, each instrument taking turns over the scratches that Rob Swift deftly manipulates. All in all, a good solid offering of the DJing aspect of hip-hop."
4,All this scratchin's makin me rich,"A really good album of progressive hip-hop. Not only does it got great DJ'ing but the MC'ing is pretty good too. This is not the best album ever made, but I bought it and I listen to it reguarly. I especially dig his ability to experiment, like the turntable vs. keyboard deal. It's just too bad the DJ'ing on that song wasn't a tad better in some parts. Great concept, and works part of the song, but on some parts the beats don't seem to really flow right... All in all though, this is one of the better hip-hop albums I own and I highly recommend it to fans of underground hip-hop. I can't wait to hear more from him."

2,disappointing,"I was ready to really fall in love with this cd, but no luck. A couple of the songs are interesting, but the rest are boring and a few are criminally annoying. And all the talking between the cuts? Please. Just stick to the tables, bub.My quest to find another DJ Shadow continues...."
3,"Ah, what about the power supply?","The Tigellian's would die without their power source (the Dodecahedron)! So it explodes and the Doctor takes the earthman back home. Ahh! And just what are the folks on Tigella left to do? I wouldn't pass up a Tom Baker episode of course but they left a pretty big hole in the plot, no?"
3,Revenge of the cactus face!,"in my opinion this is not one of the best of Tom Bakers as are any of the ones from his last season.A cuctus like creature takes over the body of a human who then impersonates the doctor sounds like something blake edwards would be better at writing. It was nice to see jacqueline hill,who played barbara all those years ago in the begining, have a big part in this one, however the rather silly special effects (including some very bad CSO effects) make this one a bit hard to give more than 3 stars.I also has some problems with the video as it flicked at times and the picture became 'washed out' but i wasn't sure if this was a problem with this copy or with the release in general, and it was not bad enough to make me spend the time and effort to get a replacement only to find out it that every video was like that, so no biggie there."
3,How do I rate thee?,"Not the worst I've seen,but by far, its nowhere near the best. It's a strange story to boot. I wouldn't pay to see it but it is still going in my library"
4,Acoustic entertainment at it's finest,"A real treat for fans of acoustic swing. This CD is made up almost entirely of original titles many of which sound like they could have been written 70 years ago. Covering unrequited love, drugs, explosives, fetishes and UFO invasions this one has something for everyone. It's the next best thing to seeing these folks live!"
1,pretty downright banal,"heard the live album and thought it reasonable enough but this here pup lacks any of its spark. quite unremarkable songs and playing, which is surprising considering their previous efforts."
2,Hum..,"Well i only like this album for one song "" Yo no te Conozco"" that's an awsome song. I like the lyrics and i like the dipest voice he has also the rythym of the music"
1,Do Not Buy! 0 Stars For This!,"I have only had this a little over two months and it has lost all of it self propelling power that I was initially impressed with. It sounds like it's struggling and dying and gives off a bad smell despite frequent filter cleanings and checking for blockage. What a waste of money! I thought for this price, it would last for at least 6 months without complaint. I wish I had the time to research before buying; so thought that I help everyone else out by including my experience. Eureka should be ashamed of making such a poor product. I thought this was a brand I could trust. They will be hearing from me. Update: We finally figured out that the belt needed to be changed...after a whole two months..pretty sad!"
2,Not a vacuum for mothers,"I am not a mother, but I know that this vacuum is not for them or others who don't have a lot of time. On carpet, it works quite well, but 90% or so of my house is tile and it doesn't pick up on tile worth a bean. It's sucking power really isn't that strong, despite cleaning the filters and having the floor setting on the lowest setting it refuses to pick up cat litter or anything that might even resemble it. The beater bar of the machine never turns off, so when I go over the tile it just flings things back out all over the room and I have to go over the same spots multiple times. It's a pain. However, I do like the round handle; it's great for lugging it up the stairs. I bought this vacuum on clearence so I can't complain too much, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I'll keep it for what little carpet I have, but I've begun the new tile vacuum hunt."
1,Will never buy Eureka again,"After doing some research and also due to the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, we purchased the Eureka Uno vacuum last year. BIG MISTAKE!It does have great suction on the carpets, but the filter cap was constanly getting plugged up, even when the ""bagless"" cannister was empty. It was gross having to manually pull pet hair and dirt out of it every time it was used. The UNO actually made more dirt when used on the bare floors, leaving a trail behind bigger than what it had just cleaned up! After calling the company and taking it in twice for service, we finally threw it out. I felt sorry for the garbage picker who took it. Our local vacuum repair man said Eureka recently merged with Electrolux and ever since they have made ""junk"" I agree."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This is the most horrible vacuum I have ever owned! Should have spent more on a product as this one actually creates more work. Filter clogs very very easily and this vaccum blows dust, hair etc all over the place - basically picks up the dust/hair and shoots it off into a different direction. With the slightest turn, it does this. When I'm ""done"" vacuuming, the mess is much worse than not even vacuuming at all! Also, although there is a setting for it, it does NOT work on anything but carpeting - and actually doesn't work well for that either. Believe me, you do not want to waste your money on this item. I regret ever purchasing this and will turn to a different brand next time."
2,"Starts off strong, but quickly disappoints","When I first brought this vacuum home, I thought it was great. It picked up a ton of dirt on the first run and the power paw seemed to do a good job on stairs and upholstery. But after only 2 days, the belt broke, requiring 2 hours on the telephone with Eureka's service department (they did ship a new belt for free).It has now been 6 months and the power paw no longer works, the vacuum spits out dirt, and I can't even use the hose attachment because the hose actually releases dust rather than capturing it."
1,Do not recommend,Does not do a good job. Does not have much suction power so it cannot such up anything beyond very small items in carpet. One reason for this is the vacuum piping gets clogged up very easily. Should have been designed with a bigger pipe and/or filter at front to prevent anything that can clog the pipe from entering. Every so often you need to take the whole machine apart to clean out the pipe. Bad purchase.
2,Dirt shooter,"I laughed when I read another reviewer express sympathy for the person who collected the Uno when he threw it out onto the street.It was probably me! For a $0 vacuum it isn't bad. The HEPA is certainly vast improvement upon our last, non-HEPA vacuum. And I'm quite pleased with the fact that I have to empty the dust bin so frequently. Better in the trash than my floor.However, I caution against using the Uno with bare feet. One would be forgiven for believing a small army of ants was assaulting your shins and ankles with a barrage of rocket-propelled detritus. No matter how many trips about the room I made, a fine layer of unsuctionable grit remained. I have no doubt that each particle was spotless."
5,Best sugarfree candy.,I have tried many different types of Sugarfree candies in the past. This has the best flavor and texture. My kids could not tell the difference. I love it.
4,Powerful product,"I purchased this product to take in combination with clove capsules, and Dr. Clark's Green Black Walnut tincture as a protocol to assist in keeping breast cancer away. I take it before dinner. At half hour before dinner on an empty stomach it hit me really strong. My body had strong nausea and headaches. It may be the enzymes and Essiac softgels I was taking at bed time also contributed to the reactions. I would take this with caution and immediately with food. I had to take a rest from the protocol to recover the next day. It is meant to kill the virulent bacteria that we get in our foods which are the source of many cancers. It sure is powerful. It must be the die-off that I suffered from. I found that O.W. Bionics provides very good products that really do what you get them for. I expect to go back to taking it again, yet with caution and food."
5,Dawn of Remembered Spring,Collection of short stories with a snake theme by rural Kentucky author Jesse Stuart. This was a favorite book of mine years ago thats now out of print but I got lucky and found a copy for fairly cheap. Book still held the same magic for me after all these years when I read it again recently.
3,Eau de pooch,"Although my wife is not crazy about the baby powder scent, I think it's fine. After a wet northwest walk it does a great job of covering up the musty wet dog smell. Apply as you do topical flea medicine ... between the shoulder blades."
3,Puppy smells great!,"I picked this product for my new puppy, to help with smelling good longer from its bath it gets. The only thing I was not happy with is paying extra postage charges when it arrived. Not sure if the company was aware of how much it was going to cost to deliver this product."
2,Smells good but leave stain,I have a yellow lab and a white labradoodle. I used this product on both and it left yellow stain makrs on my white labradoodle but not on my lab. The product does smell nice and last for about a week or so but don't get it if you have a white dog!
3,Needs to be read along with other books,"As a computer Science student, I suggest that this book should not be the only reference and the following books should be bought together for a good grasp on real time systems.1. Real Time systems By Jane W.S Liu2. Real-Time Systems: Scheduling, Analysis, and Verification3. Real-Time Systems by CM Krishna and Kang.G.ShinThe above 3 books make a perfect combination to learn enough about real time systems.Regards,Yasirhttp://yasir03.online.fr"
1,Should've been worse,"This movie was not bad enough to be funny. The actors, while not great, were competent enough and had boring but competently written dialogue to work with. In terms of film making, they knew how to set up and properly frame shots, but the shots were not interesting to look at. The gore was tame by today's standards. There is absolutely nothing interesting about this movie. I recommend watching popcorn in the microwave or perhaps grass growing."
1,Don't rent this one,"Typical slasher movie leaving you with a lot and I mean a lot of unanswered questions. Skip this one, you will be glad you did."
5,Thanks for the support!,"Just wanted to say thanks for taking the time to leave a review. If you saw it at SCREAMFEST, you were a part of a very special moment for us and if you have pre-ordered, please let us know your thoughts once you've watched it & if you like it, please tell you friends...or at least invite them over to watch ;)Thanks again!Ace"
1,"HORRIBLE, least original movie ever!!!","If you're a true fan of horror than skip this piece of crap! If you expect anything awesome, new or fun go with the classics. Texas Chainsaw, Psycho, F13, ect.... because all this movie is is all old skool horror movies bunched into one. ""Terrifying"" mask, check. horrible acting, check. Redneck hillbillies, check. Lost in the woods, check. Whole town's in om it, check. Everybody split up, check. Never killing the killer when you have the chance... TIMES 5, check! Horrible decisions by the protagonists, check. A 5 year old could write this crap and probably did... so I guess if you wanna scare your 5 year old nephew or son, this one's for you!"
2,THIS KILLER IS PIGHEADED,"Here we go again. Five young students zip off to rural MADISON COUNTY to interview the author of a book about an elusive serial killer.Naturally, the locals don't want the snoopy youngsters around and find themselves targets for the deranged killer, named Pighead because....ta-dum, he wears a pighead mask!Director Erik England keeps the pace unusually slow for this style of movie. The script offers little new and has a muddled unresolved ending. The performances seem called in, especially sweet storekeeper, Erma.It's all been done before---and better. MADISON COUNTY should hit your local Wal-Mart's discount bin soon!"
5,2002 Mlllennium Collection,"Randy & the Rainbows have done it again! It's one of their best collections yet of their finest since their Top 10 hit ""Denise"" climbed the charts in 1963. In addition to ""Denise"", they have also recorded a recent Club Mix version of the same song, fully loaded with keyboards and the same great lead and background vocal sounds that has been their hallmark spanning the decades. This CD is a fantastic rainbow collage of recent songs, ""Silver and Gold"" and ""Laura"", as well as their older classics from the sixties. An absolute must-buy for those digging GOOD rock!"
1,Very disappointing,"My mistake about ordering this book was that I hadn't realisd that ""Holidays"" meant days off and not what the American author would have called ""Vacation"". so it wasn't the help I had wanted. Also the small rather pale print was not in any way compelling neither were the quotations in italics."
1,Difficult,"Tried this DVD in two different VCR's , then a laptop and then a desktop. Couldn't view the movie. Grandson took along to Indiana to see if it worked on their VCR."
1,Diary of an Annoying Kid,"I have a pretty high tolerance for kids movies but this one was more than I could take. I haven't read the books but, according to my 12-year-old, this movie is stitched together from several of them (no wonder it lacks any semblance of narrative cohesion). Also, they apparently changed Greg, the main character, so that in addition to being wimpy, he has an oversized ego. Hard to find a more annoying combination IMO. If you have kids, they may dig it but no adult should be forced to sit through this horrible excuse for a movie, which stinks more than that ancient piece of moldy cheese out on the playground."
2,Power to Losers,"Of the three teen self-empowerment movies currently out on DVD and rating for creativity, acting, cinematography, storyline and I never want to see it again vs. I've got to see this one again, is as follows: On a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 as a jaw dropping great) then ""Mystery Team"" is a zero; ""Kickass"" is an eight; :Diary ..."" is a three.So, good audience - choose your time (life) appropriately."
5,Great Movie,"The movie is fun, well assembled and well performed by actors and director; although some parts or names do not completely match with the books, this does definitely not make any difference on the final result; my kids love it!"
5,Great movie,"My whole family loved the movie, including my two kids who are 5 and 7 years old. We read the book first then watched, lot's of fun!"
5,Diary of a Wimpy Kid,A great trilogy for the whole family! Me and my family loved all of the diary of a wimpy kid movies. Your kids will want to watch it over and over again!
2,Shallow protagonist,"I watched this film with my 6 year old. The main character's arc is shallow, egotistical, punk-ish and self-serving. Maybe better enjoyed as a teenage viewer?."
4,Funny clean fun,"About kids, some really funny situations, some gross stuff, some scary stuff but not too intense. I'd give a 7 out of 10."
3,My kids liked it,"Obviously I'm not a member of the targeted audience, but my kids who are just loved it. In fact, my boys have been reading each and every one of the books that are out. If your kids like this series, they will likely enjoy the books, or vice versa."
3,Juvenile movies at amazon.com,This is a PG movie that is enjoyable for children between the ages of seven to twelve. An adult can find an occasional moment to smile or chuckle. The story of the exploits of a hapless boy is preferred by the older children but the younger ones will watch.
3,Diary of a Wimpy Kid,"The movie version of the first book in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series was released in 2010. It's pretty faithful to the book with the exception of the character Angie, who I don't remember being in the book. She is a seventh grader and serves as a mentor to Greg, who is only in sixth. She's played by Chlo Grace Moretz who I love in everything she does. She's such a fabulous actress (Let Me In, Dark Shadows) that it was weird seeing her in a goofy kids movie.The acting by the other kids in this movie was good and not over the top cheesy like in some of those Disney channel tween shows. There was a fair amount of grossness that boys will love. My six and eight year old boys thought this movie was hilarious and were riveted by it. My attention started to wane for the last half of the movie, probably because having read the book, I already knew what was going to happen. Even though it wasn't my cup of tea, it was a great way to keep my boys entertained on a snowy afternoon."
1,Horrible,"Never watching again, don't waste your money It sucks. I was very exited but was sadly let down with the bad movie."
4,Diary of a Wimpy Kid,Cute movie! I have considered renting this movie for a while. I am glad I did. Nothing else to say.
4,cute,"This movie was cute. it kept my attention and i thought that the story was a good lesson about bullying in school and the dire need in middle school to be popular to the point of just trying too hard to be something or someone that you arent. The irony that his friend and only friend would succeed accidentally at being popular where all of his attempts had failed was cute. The eating of the cheese was over the top, hence the 4 star instead of the 5."
4,"Fun, funny, and a little too much humor","This movie is a good kids movie about a boy who starts middle school. Middle school is actually shown like it is but, with some exaggeration. there bathroom humor, and a little more humor, an immodest woman, and they take God's name in vain at least 3 times. I know right now you may be wondering if you should really see this movie, but I liked it so, it's u to you now. :)"
4,Very funny,"I saw this in the theaters and at home. It's worthwhile watching with the kids and getting a good hour plus of laughs. There are a couple of scenes that are over the top crude, and more finnicky parents may wish to preview it to skip these. Overall though, the movie is excellently done, with the characters cast perfectly, especially the two major protagonists, Greg and Rowley. The humor is consistent throughout and there is one scene in particular that ranks for me among the funniest in cinema. If your kid enjoyed the books, definitely have them watch the movie."
3,Very good for those following the book series,"For any kid reading the book series, this movie is a most.It-s very funny and easy to follow. Kids loved this film"
5,movie,good movie it was in really good shape my kids loved the move thanks again for the movie and the shipment was on tim
2,Don't waste Time on Movie; Read the Book,"First off, I thought the movie would be animated as the book had many great cartoon images that are for kids. The book went into much more of the thoughts kids spend their time thinking about and presents them in a very thought provoking and funny way at their level of understanding. It shows kids that other kids have a lot of the same thoughts as they have. Except for maybe the first five minutes, the movie was not any of these things.."
3,It's OK,"It's OK. About what you'd expect. Fun, but at times painful, movie. Don't expect too much and you'll probably enjoy it."
3,The book is much better than the movie,"The kids wanted me to purchase it, but instead we rented it via instant video, and I am clad. It will be one less, unused DVD laying around."
4,Pleasantly surprised!,My five year old saw a trailer for The Diary of a Wimpy Kid and kept asking if we could rent it. I was afraid it would be to mature for him. Many of my friends told me how much their kids loved the whole series of books and how funny the dvd was. We were pleasantly surprised to find such a funny good family movie. We watched it with a group of people from five years old to sixty and everyone had a good laugh. It's a favorite around our house.
5,Great movie for kids of all ages!!!,"My son loves this movie and quite frankly, I like it too. Its very enjoyable. Bluray is good too. Try to get for under $10"
4,Good movie.,My 7 year old and i watched this together and had a great time. She loved it and i laughed out loud several times. Good movie!
3,It is fun to some ppl but not me,"It was a okay for a boy who get teased at the first day of school and tried with friend to be popular. He remind me of somebody nerdy , but he tried be cooler anyway. It aint really a loud ""LOL"" . It is okay as a cute that he has a story of his own life ."
1,Inappropriate for children,"While some of this movie was funny and entertaining, I did not care for some of the material, specifically crude humor and the picture of a half-naked woman shown over and over. This movie was marketed to children, but contained offensive material."
1,Disturbing,"I found this movie incredibly disturbing. Was I the only one? Here's a kid who lives in a house where his older brother bullies him constantly, and the mother doesn't have a clue and does nothing about it. This is supposed to be funny? And the middle school is portrayed as the most horrible place in the world. My son is going to enter middle school next year and found the movie scary, not funny. Is he being too sensitive?"
1,"Love the books, hate the movie","Some parts were funny and some parts were just plain weird, but it didn't follow the book. It didn't have a lot of the characters in the book and the ones they had seemed to have very different personalities than in the book."
2,DVD condition.,"This item was advertised as 'used, very good condition', however the case was in poor condition. The DVD itself was fine, but I was going to give this item to someone and it simply was not presentable. I have made prior purchases from this seller and have always been satisfied. I suppose 3 out of 4 satisfactory purchases is a good average."
2,"Bad title, Bad movie, waste of time, waste of money","This is an extremely terrible movie. In addition to be plotless, boring and annoying, the behavior, events and looks of the actors did not fit the age group they were supposed to depict! Instead of acting like middle schoolers, Greg and his friends behaved more like 2nd or 3rd graders! I can say no more except dont watch this movie! It is not amusing, entertaining or enjoyable! The only word to describe it is stupid!"
3,"Your sons already love it, right?","This plays *really* differently in live-action than it did on the page, which I found very interesting to think about while watching it. The book is so cartoony that none of the over-the-top things that happen to Greg are a problem, but they seem less likely -- and more dangerous -- with real twelve-year-olds. The movie is lovable like an ingratiating dog, but about as deep."
3,Not bad for younger kids,"This movie is alright for very young adults.... I would say up to 15 years old....For adults .... I would move on to another movie, this one has its moments but a good portion of the movie is about how one kid is leading another down a bad road, then at the end doing the right thing.I would not really recommend this movie to any teenager... maybe preteen... but that's a far as I would go..."
3,Good Movie For Pre-Teens,"My twelve year old son really enjoyed this movie, but my older kids said it was a little too juvenile for them. Otherwise good movie."
3,Amusing Movie,"Amusing movie, no thought required to watch it.Comes as a three disk set, Blu ray, Standard DVD and Digital for computers etc. Just as well because my Blu-ray player wont play that copy. I assume it needs a software update but the manufacturer is not being very helpful."
4,great kid movie,"I have seen all of these movies and they are lame but, kids 10-12 like them Very enjoyable to watch."
4,Good song writing.,"I bought this album back in 1982 for about $2 in a discount bin while I was in college and couldn't stop listening to it. This is some early work of Bruce Roberts who has gone to write some notable tunes (including the theme to the Kate Jackson gay love triangle film ""Making Love"", recorded by Roberta Flack.) A favorite tune ""I'd Rather be Alone"" is hauntingly touching and the duet on another track with Connie Stevens is - well, quirky. Bruce is probably known more as a writer than a recording artist but he has put out a few albums of his own voice. I'm glad to see this album is available on CD."
2,"Good beam, not all that comfortable","This is a product that offers great value for money, however, it took a long time to arrive, it was well packaged and well built. The only problem is that it is not very comfortable to work out on. It does not cushion your feet like a professional beam. The positive aspect is that it is 1/3 of the price of the professional beam. In retrospect, I would not purchase this item again, I would go with the professional beam"
1,THIS IS NOT TWO BOXES,"Don't be fooled by the ""2-"" in front of the 3715 model number, YOU ARE NOT GETTING TWO BOXES, even though the PRICE IS DOUBLE what these boxes cost at every other retailer. Amazon has clearly made a clerical error somewhere and is vastly overcharging for this item. These boxes should cost between $4.30 and $4.80 each and you can easily find them for that price elsewhere online. Unless you are buying just one box and a bunch of other stuff so you get the free shipping don't buy this box from Amazon until the price is adjusted.Full disclosure: when I purchased this item thinking I was getting two I informed Amazon of the price disparity and they agreed to double my order at no extra charge. So I don't fault Amazon for this, it's just a mixup in their price structure somewhere."
4,Black Custom Fit Three Light Wall Lantern,"This lantern offers versatility, which I could not find anywhere else. I had envisioned installing the lantern one way but when I tried it I didn't like it. I then modified the lantern to have the lights come down from the top rather than up from the bottom and then the lantern looked great! So if you're not sure what will look right, this lantern gives you plenty of options so that it will look great when you are done.My only negative comment was that the manufacterer did not appropriately package the small screws in a plastic bag. These screws fell out of the box when I opened it and I almost lost one of them. This is poor packaging design which would have left me with an unhangable lantern. They need to correct their packaging."
3,why is frankie being slighted??,"My boyfriend let me listen to this cd for the first time about 2 weeks ago, and I cant stop thinking about it the entire CD is off the hook and he is not getting any recognition for it.I would like to know why not you cant buy the whole cd anywhere and that is very strange and to think this cd came out years ago I dont understand this at all. Please advise???"
4,If I Had You I would...,Go and buy this CD. It is a really good song. It is something you can romance of of with your boo. If you buy this CD you will not be disappointed. I garentee it.
4,Everything I'd Hoped For,"""The London Encyclopia"" has it all, containing everything I ever wanted to know about the city. This thick tome covers both past and present London landmarks and is of particular benefit to anyone who enjoys history. Definitely a keeper. My husband calls me a geek because on sleepless nights I pour over these pages until my eyes ache."
2,London Encyclopedia,"While generally useful, this book contains errors of fact. I know because I have studied late 15th century England for 50 years, and those things that run contrary to my other books leave me dubious. It may be this book seeks to be too comprehensive.Caveat Emptor!"
5,The Definitive Version of the Definitive Documentary,Bob Dylan - Don't Look Back (1965 Tour Deluxe Edition)This is a must have for all fans of Bob Dylan. The paperback and flipbook are welcome added additions. Worth the price and highly recommended.
5,What Really Happened in Rock Music,"Says more about 60's Rock than anything ever made. Watch Dylan turn John Lennon into a blithering idiot. Why this video is not in production, I don't know."
5,An excellent view of Dylan before he went electric,"Dylan's '65 London tour was one of the last acoustic tours before he went electric the following year at Newport. It's also a wonderful look at how the press treated Dylan and other musicians (e.g. the Beatles) during that time. Rolling Stone wasn't around in '65, let alone rock critics and reporters. Hence, Dylan was upset with how magazines like Time would present him."
3,Dylan's personality a real turn-off,"Most people who come to see this are those who are fans of Bob Dylan's music. After seeing this, i still like his music, but one finds it difficult to admire the man behind the songs afterward. Aside from the gripping performances (and the amusing ""Subterrarean Homesick Blues""), we see Dylan rudely and arrogantly treating almost everyone around him with gross contempt. He's really hard to like after seeing this. However, Joan Baez brightens things up by allowing us to see her lighter side. She makes wild faces into the camera and does an amusing belly-dance parody."
5,It all stays good,"I first saw this film as part of the Vancouver Film Festival one summer evening in the late sixties. It engrossed me then and in its VHS form and in this new double cd release. What's great about this issue is the ""out takes"" have been reworked into a companion piece that accompanies the original release in this package. The commentaries supplied by D.A. Pennebaker and Bob Nieuwerth are fun and insightful. I loved it. and can't wait for someone to do a similar treatment to ""Eat The Document"", Dylan's tour with the Hawks a year and a bit later."
3,Dylan- Behind the Music (ho-hum),"After watching this, you will never want to see another English hotel room again. Most of the film consists of Dylan playing odd bars of music while his hangers-on laugh at everything he says. You will not find out a whole lot more about him. A little dull and disappointing."
3,Dylan - DVD,"The DVD that I ordered arrived on time and was the product that I was looking for. However, when the product arrived the plastic casing was a little wavy - indicating it had been used/moved quite a bit. The DYLAN DVD was labeled ""Like New,"" but did not look as if it were recently purchased."
2,Legendary doesn't mean watchable,"I might've expected too much .I'd seen Monterey Pop , which is by the same director and liked the energy of that .I'd heard a lot about this 'legendary' film . Too much of it is too slow .We already know Bob is hip - luckily there's some different aspects to the film , when the promoter is talking with TV stations negotiating a fee for Bob's appearance .There is interrupted music making and it is made obvious Bob is a celebrity , but he spends most of the film behaving like an idiot . In a way , I suppose this is a 'puff piece' , something to make Bob seem hip to all the kids .Bob is acting in this , so why not just watch something where we're sure he's acting in character ? Hang out for the DVD release of Sam Peckinpah's Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid .Subtitles would have helped - a bargain basement release almost redeemed by the commentary .A disappointment . Let the buyer aware - rent it first ."
3,Religion of Dylan,"If you belong to the Religion of Dylan, this is a five-star item. For the rest of us, this is a pretty good concert movie spliced with long episodes of hippie profound talk. The music makes it worth it."
1,WARNING! For hardcore Dylan fans only!,I am not a hardcore Dylan fan. I want to be upfront about that. I watched this last night with a friend that is a hardcore Dylan fan. I though this was just about awful and my friend conceded that this was one for big Dylan fans. Not interesting. No good performace clips. Dylan being an SOB to various folks. Rambling on ... Not good.
4,It was such a long time ago,"Of course I love Bob Dylan and I have most of his albums and I've even met him. His talent is limitless and far beyond everyone else's. He is as dynamic today as he ever was and his every song stands on its own merit. But, this video was shot such a long time ago -the 60s. It's arty and well-done and it's certainly an important historical piece. If you're a big fan you'll enjoy it but it's not the type of movie most people wold watch again. It's slow moving and can't compare to the type of documentary we are used to nowadays. Worst part is that there are no complete songs. The interviews and songs are cut up and mixed. I feel that one can't have Dylan explained to you - you have to open yourself to Bob Dylan and just feel the song as best as you can. Everyone will feel it differently. That is the mastery of his gift."
5,The 2nd DVD is....,"...worth the price of the set. Believe me, you will get as much enjoyment out of the performances on the 2nd DVD that you did the movie on the first."
4,Don't look ... listen!,"The best thing about the DVD version of ""Don't Look Back"" is the commentary. It puts a lot of things into perspective. But be aware that this is no restored film. The flaws, such as cracks in the negative, are made even more visible by the clarity of DVD. And read carefully: The full-length versions of the songs from the 1965 British tour are presented here in ""audio"" only. The fact that there isn't a single completed song in the film has always been a sore spot with me, but the filmmaker talks about that on the commentary. All in all, a look at Bob Dylan back in '65 is worth the time to any music fan. And this is currently the best way to view it, despite the few flaws."
5,Fabulous costume for little rail fans,"This costume was so cute on our little rail fan and he especially loved the gloves and hat. I have purchased costumes from this company before and they have great customer service, shipping and quality. I highly recommend this costume and company for anyone looking for an engineers costume for their little one."
5,Cute outfit,"I got this for my 12 month old's first birthday party. We did a train theme. He is a big baby, 30 inches and 22 pounds and it fit him perfect. Held up nicely in the wash."
1,Cheaply made - buttons fall off first time worn,This outfit was darling. My grandson wore it to see Thomas the Train. Came home and notice that the buttons were all lose. Went to take outfit off and the buttons for the overalls fell out of the stretched out fabric! Sad to pay this much for one wearing.
1,Size 2-3 ridiculously large,"I bought this for my son for Halloween. He is 27 months, and average in height/weight. I purchased the ""2T-3T"" which is advertised for children 33""-36"" in height. When it arrived, the item is ridiculously too big. The label reads ""Size 2-3"" immediately adjacent to a graphic stating ""Ages 3+"". I measured the length of the overalls themselves to be 33"". What I received is more appropriate for a 4-5 year old. I almost never buy clothes on Amazon because I don't trust sizing, but I mistakenly thought a children's costume would be safe. I guess it's off to the Halloween store..."
4,"Nice, but big","Great costume, length was good for my 4 year old but overall size was much to big for him. Sizing off a bit."
1,Oy Guvalt!,"Well, boys and girls, after a short career and a grand total of one hit (why that became a hit I'll never know), the Baha Men release a - get this - greatest hits album.WHAAAAAT??!?!?It's bad enough they released ""Who Let The Stupid Dogs Out"", but now they're releasing a whole album of clones? What is the matter with the record company? This is the kind of album that nine-year-olds buy and then regret buying when they're twelve. Parents, I'll just say this: If you buy this for your kids, make sure you have some aspirin nearby. I'm just going to stop here, reviewing this ""album"" any further is a waste of my time and yours."
2,Does not work for us,"I am a huge Charlotte Mason advocate and a fan of Karen Andreola. I tried very hard to like this book. The style in which the book was written makes it extremely hard to understand. My 8 year old son, who is not a fan of Language Arts to begin with, is more frustrated than ever trying to get through this. I have put a lot of effort trying to decipher what is meant by the explanations so that I can make sense of it to my son. The questions are very unclear and quite frankly, at times make no sense. There are some chapters that are better than others, and I may be able to use it as a reference in the future, only once a particular subject is already understood and if practice is needed. For those two reasons I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. Sorry Charlotte and Karen!"
3,A for effort,"I bought this book and found it was not in the format I could use to educate my children. They didn't have the patience to sit and listen to me read instruction to them, then afterward get out a piece of paper to answer the questions, flipping between paper and book. The wording appears simple, but the choice of words were not helpful for us. I gave the book a fair try, but got nowhere and had to start over using another format for teaching my boys grammar at the elementary level. They preferred worksheets and I preferred a series that would progress them through middle school without boring them.Someone else may find it useful as an introductory book to grammar. It is laid out simply and clearly, and admittedly, I was impressed with it; just not fitting for fidgety little boys. Know your children's style and preferences for learning, this may be for you. Then again, if they are like mine....don't bother!"
1,Strande book,"This was the most complex book ever! Didn't understand it , some one had penciled round sentences . Not for me at all ."
2,Bloated and Wandering,"The essence of this book could have been boiled down to 50 pages. The author goes on and on in a manner that at times seems incohesive. There are a number of other self improvement books that are more focused, clearly written, and ultimately beneficial to an individual striving to better understand and improve himself or herself by tapping into the subconscious mind."
4,I return to this one often...,"I first bought and read this book back in the early 90s, after reading an interview with guitarist Steve Vai in MUSICIAN magazine. This is the book that started Vai on a spiritual path, and it's been a favorite of mine as well.I've suffered from a cyclical depression for 12 years. Whenever I feel ""stuck,"" I re-read this book.There must be something I've forgotten, I think, or why would I allow suffering to take over?Better go back and read ""Magic in Your Mind"" again!We can have whatever we want in this life. KNOWING and BELIEVING makes it so."
1,what happened?,"Sebadoh is done. This album does nothing for me. I have witnessed one of the most revolutionary bands of the 90s turn into an average rock band right before my eyes. It started with Bakesale, and it's gone downhill ever since. I understand that the members of the band grew up, but i grew up too, and i'm not boring. So why are they? I now realise more than ever that ""Eric Gaffney"" leaving the band was the end of Sebadoh as i knew them. It's time for us Indie fans from the early 90s to move on. There are way better albums to spend our money on. And NO, i'm not talking about the new Built to Spill cd, cuz it sucks too."
3,This is not a bad album! (Just a bad Sebadoh album),"After releasing some of the best indie-rock albums the world has ever seen, it is easy to see why many, including me, are disapointed with Sebadoh's new album. That's not to say that ""The Sebadoh"" is bad, because it isn't. It's just not up to the standard that the band set for themselves with their last 5 records. There is still much to praise on this album. Some of Jason's songs, like ""It's All You"" and ""Decide"" are his best ever. Lou doesn't contribute anything close to ""On Fire"", ""Skull"", or ""Cliche"", but ""Weird"", ""Tree"", ""Flame"", and ""Love is Stronger"" are all pretty good."
2,the album i waited for?,lou-b and the boys really are floating.they're bored with their music: one more like this and I will be too.
4,sebadoh continues to grow and delivers an inspiring disc.,"the hooks and the ballads just keep on rolling with sebadoh. you wonder if they will ever run out of great ideas for songs. this one is full of great stuff, including the ""aw yah"" at the end of ""tree"". my favorite cd this year so far."
1,where are the songs?,"Jeez, this was disappointing, and I've loved Lou/Sebadoh back to ""Weed Forestin.""First off, given the amount of time they had to work on material, I'm amazed at how poor the songs are. For all the overproduction on ""Harmacy"", that album still had half a dozen or so really good tunes. Five minutes after listening to ""The Sebadoh"", nothing stayed with me.Secondly...I'm glad they've got a drummer they like. But, does that mean the drums have to be so friggin' loud? If that's my choice, I'll take Bob or Eric's sloppiness any day."
3,The Sebadoh,"Although it does grow on you a little, The Sebadoh is by no means the bands best work. Personally I was a little disapointed."
3,"Sebadoh goes mainstream, but it doesn't totally suck.","The Sebadoh was my first Sebadoh album. Since then, I have bought more in this order: Bakesale, Bubble & Scrape, Sebadoh III, and Harmacy. It was strange going backwards in time. At first, I thought The Sebadoh was really good. I played it constantly. But after buying the older stuff, I see just how great they used to be. They were more interesting and had more range, even though Eric was an oddball. It's impossible to match Bakesale's energy or Bubble & Scrapes variety. The Sebadoh is good. I loved most of Jason's songs, but Lou's songs seem pretty tame and dull now. Does he really FEEL anything anymore or is he just cranking songs out?"
3,Decent. Not their best effort.,"Following in the mainstream wake of Harmacy, this album isn't all that interesting or challenging. That said, Sebadoh fans will definately want to buy it. Lou Barlow, as always, is incapable of writing an uncatchy song and introduces several new standards here. ""Sorry"" and ""Love is Stronger"" are particularly good, with the former sounding a bit like his Folk Implosion stuff. Jason Lowenstein's contributions, as always, balance out Lou's sentimentality with their edginess. While nowhere near as good as The Freed Weed, Sebadoh III or Bubble & Scrape, at least this one is rawer than Harmacy. That album was way overproduced, and Eric Masunaga does a good job of recalling the band's low-fi roots on this one."
5,what's not to get ?,"First off, this is the best Sebadoh album since Bubble & Scrape. Second, they didn't kick out Eric Gaffney. He quit/rejoined so many times that it became tedious with the final straw coming when he decided he was better off as an 'absentee' member - i.e just send me my royalty check and I'll send you my songs. Third, I don't really see how people can't 'get' this album . What's to get ? It's a collection of songs. It ain't 'Sgt. Pepper' or 'Dark Side of the Moon'. There's no interwoven theme or message. There's some loud songs and there's a couple slower ones. Russ Pollard's drumming is great and adds tremendous rhythmic variety that's been missing. They took some chances - 'Flame' is unlike anything they've ever done. They use more keyboards (almost every song) then they've ever done. You people expect too much out of your geniuses."
1,Look this is not flamenco,"I get irritated seeing all these Ottmar Liebert clones with their so called 'Nouveau Flamenco'. This has absolutely nothing to do with Flamenco!!Flamenco is a lot more than elevator music played by people trying to look spanish. What is new about that? and what is even remotely flamenco about it??There is a wave of real new flamenco from spain, so listen to the real stuff instead.Its like my teacher from madrid said ""This stuff a five year old from Andalucia can play with his feet""And give me a break 'careless whisper' lol"
3,"Heavy on data, not so much on readability","Although it was refreshing to read an account of language acquisition from the point of the view of Pragmatics, I felt the text was very dense and not organized well within the chapters. Dr. Clark includes information about many relevant experiments, but at times it was hard to distinguish her own interpretations from paraphrased citations. The chart dealing with phonetics also had quite a few errors.I hope the second edition turns out to be better than this one!"
4,My Son Like it,I bought this because my one year old son & I used to listen these songs at Pandora. Then I decided to buy it. He likes it.
4,Playdate Fun CD,"Some of the words are different than the way I remember, but the cd does keep our little one entertained."
5,Sing-a-long for parents and toddlers,"I love to sing. Thankfully, my daughter is showing signs of a similar interest. So far. She turned 2 at the end of August 2009, and I bought this cd in July b/c she so loved me singing ""Row, row, row your boat"" and other oldies but goodies. There are all kinds of toddler tunes out there, but I wanted one to hearken back to my own childhood. Playdate Fun definitely fit the bill. Even my husband enjoys it, and he has commented on how he likes it better than the other cds we subsequently bought.My daughter asks for her ""cd...cd"" and we happily put it on. Buy this. You will not regret it. Plus, it's not annoying like some toddler tunes are! :)"
4,Three Worth Watching!,"There were many epic battles in World War II, but certainly these three stand out. I recommend this DVD to any WWII buff. It is well-done and informative."
5,Some Great Advice and Anecdotes,"Metropolitan Anthony (Anthony bloom) so gracefully presents some wonderful and very practical and useful advice concerning prayer. He takes the reader by the hand and journeys through the beginnings (an in some ways prayer is always about ""the beginnings"") and on through some of the pitfalls and blessings one may expect on the road of prayer. He shows us that prayer is indeed a lifelong endeavor which yields results that are sometimes hard to quantify, but nonetheless are tangible. I highly recommend this book along withCourage to Pray, also by Anthony Bloom. As a last comment, I would recommend anything Bloom wrote as something worthwhile, though his books are sometimes difficult to come by -- but the search is worth the fruits of the labor."
4,The Madwoman and The Oil Drillers,"The Madwoman of Chaillot ( as portrayed by Katharine Hepburn in the movie version) is a two-act play about the destruction of the forces of evil by one older, senile woman - the Madwoman. A group of money-hungry corporation presidents team up with prospectors who claim to have found oil right beneath the streets of Paris's Chaillot suburb, and the Madwoman rallies her bohemian friends and neighbors to stop them from destroying the city. The play is very dramatic and also humorous in parts; it seems primarily a fantasy, but has several fantastic parts for female characters, among them the Madwoman and her group of eccentric, delightful fellow Madwomen. I recommend it highly to any group of adolescent/young adult actors who are looking for a challenge."
2,Didn't know this was a play,I must not have read the description of this item correctly; I thought it was a book. Maybe there isn't a book.The Madwoman of Chaillot.
4,Although It's Been Many Years,"I believe this is the play in which the role ""Countess"" appears...and if it is, I would like to write my opinion based upon performing in the role of Countess many years ago. This play is hysterical, entertaining, and a joy for those performing it as well as those seeing or reading it. It involves eccentric, rich old ladies who try to carry on with afternoon tea despite thier various quirky personalities(mainly quirky due to senility and the hallucinations that accompany it). A great play for adolescent through adult actors. It is worth having on your shelf if you instruct drama in any way."
4,Good Product,"Simple, basic lotion; Absorbs quickly; not sticky; doesn't interfere with fragrances; not watery, not thick. Wish it came in a 16 oz. size."
3,Better than some of his previous work,"John has improved his song writing skills though his singing needs to be tamed a little. He sometimes tries to reach for notes that quickly start to sounds painful. I know this from personal experience as a former band member of one of his past projects (many as they are). Though I haven't kept ties with John, I can't deny that this CD is some of his best work yet even if it could use a little more of something. I regretfully even found myself learning the lyrics and singing along."
4,"Good story for kids, some creepy stuff though","We read this for my son's school book club (he is in 4th grade) and for the most part everyone in the club enjoyed it. Many of the parents commented that a few of the scenes were a bit grotesque, mainly the parts about the spiders that had baby heads, but on the same note, all the kids thought those same parts were pretty cool.The story is pretty predictable for an adult but to a child who is not yet familier with typical storylines, the book has plenty of suspense. While the book's main character is a boy, this book was recommened to the club by a girl in the class who had read it several times and had listed it as one of her all time favorite books so it appears that this book is entertaining for both boys and girls."
5,Incredible story,"I loved this book, I loved this book enough to go out and purchase the author's other books. This is only the start to a very in depth world. I think the author does a good job portraying the giant's broken family and adds a bit of mysticism to their home on top of the clouds.I like the added detail of just how much water a beanstalk that size had to consume to grow that quickly, also the subtle idea that it lends strength to the person climbing it. I also liked the portrayal of Jack as a rich, old man, with a legend floating behind him that no one quite believes.I had to feel bad for the giantess though, she went from an abusive husband to a cruel son."
3,Excellent Product with an unfortunate design flaw,"This is a truly well made product made of quality materials. The instructions for installation were easy to follow. There is one problem however. There is a small gap in the bottom of the door sealing which results in a small amount of water getting out onto the floor. There is no gasket under the curved metal frame on the hinge side that the glass fits into. When I called Kohler Customer Service, I was routed to a technical expert who told me they have had other calls about the problem, but there is nothing that can be done about it. I was dumbfounded. I paid $500 for a shower door that leaks and Kohler's response was not acceptable in my opinion. She also told me informally that other people ""just gunk in a lot of silicone"" to take care of the problem. I was very disappointed in the lack of a solution."
5,Excellent! Israeli Oriental music at its best!,"Eyal Golan's new album (released in Israel Nov. 2002) is truly one of his best albums to date (well, all of his albums are excellent!)The best songs are: (1) Elohai [My G-d] & (3) Tachzari [Come Back] - beautiful melodies and lyrics.Highly recommended! You won't go wrong with this album if you love Israeli/Middle Eastern music."
3,cool stuff,"I'm Martina from Indonesia. two years ago I listened to one of meja's song, i'm not sure what the title is. the song sounds like :"" i miss your love since you've been gone, i find it's hard to go on..."" and at the reffrain : "" i am missing you, waht can i do thousand miles away from you..."" so if any of you know what the title is, please write yoour review to amazon.com thank you"
3,It works,"I'm not sure how to review a storage box, but it works! It was shipped quickly. The box it was shipped in was WAY too big."
2,Kevin Ames - Get a new graphic designer,"This is the second book that I have bought written by Kevin Ames. This is a very big disappointment, and quite unlike the previous version of the same title. So, what's wrong? The text is nearly unreadable the fonts are all over the place, the sizes of the fonts chosen are way too large. Frankly, I wish I had my money back.Now the other side, Kevin's work is ground breaking. His suggestions about improving skin texture are to be found no where else. His technique is unsurpassed. I want to be sure that I make that clear. I also have his video from Software Cinema. So, one more time; Kevin is great! The book is useless to me, because the graphics are just bad. Would I buy another Kevin Ames book? Yes, but I would not buy it sight unseen.[...]"
5,An essential reference book for working programmers,"At my workplace, this book circulates between all programmers throughout the day. It is not a beginner's how-to book, but a reference guide with listings of operations, descriptions and syntax. A great assistance in developing new software."
5,Snow White's perfect match,The bag fitted loads in and matched my costume pefectly. It was easy to carry and didn't fall apart. I will deffo use it again next year!
1,No Book 1,"The low rating is based not on the quality of the books, but on the fact that the whole set seems to not really be available. When I received this set, only book 2 was included. Customer service was fantastic, and sent a replacement--but again only book 2 was sent. I was told then they could only refund my money."
5,"Great Shoe, Great Price","I love SuperStars, but they are so hard to find. They come and go out seasonal styles. Depends on the time of year and what store you go to. I love these old school sneakers but hate paying 80 bucks for them in a store. I have like 10 different colored pairs of these things."
3,A Specialized Classic,"I agree with most of what the previous reviewer said. This short novel is required reading for anyone studying French literature, women's literature in particular. However, the first chapter is mostly devoted to long lists of names and descriptions of various people, some of whom are important to the story and others who are not. This technique tends to make all the characters run together. It is very difficult to remember all of the characters, who they are related to and/or allied with, etc. Some sort of ""family tree"" would have been nice. Also, I thought the ending (which I will not give away) was a little contrite and not really up to the standard of the rest of the book. This translation is very readable, but reading it in the orginal language is preferable. This is not ""beach"" reading, but if you are deeply interested in French literature and/or European history, this story may prove rewarding."
2,Torn... good or bad?,"The tale of a fictional woman living at the French Court during the 17th century reign of Henry II. It is a very slow read at first, but then the pace picks up. Many real historical figures make an appearance, either in person or in gossip. A nice historical romance thus far, with plenty of detailed court intrigues. While the main character (and her mother) are fictional, the rest of the characters are not (including the Prince of Cleves himself, who never married in real life). Keeping in mind the period this was written, it's quite good. But the constant referring to characters by titles/surnames rather than given names got very old, and I found Madame de Cleves too hypocritical to like the character."
1,"So Bad It Almost Cost Me My ""A"" in English Lit","I was forced to read this literary sleeping pill way back in college, when there was no internet and not even any Cliff's or Monarch Notes for it. I refused to prop up my eyelids with toothpicks and muddle through it, and eventually found some off-brand cheat-sheet that had a three-paragraph synopsis of the book. Dreading the ""F"" I was sure to get on the upcoming test, I nonetheless memorized every single word of those three paragraphs, managed a ""D"" on the test and eventually kept my ""A"" for the course. Ugh.See the review ""A 17th Century Soap Opera"" for a more traditional take and plot review. This book IS a soap opera, and we all know how ""worthwhile"" they are."
5,This is worth the HYPE,"This CD is excellent - every single song on this album is excellent!!! I listen to it at work and while driving, I thank God for great Christian music like this CD. I am sure that even my non-christian friends will like listening to this music. Thank you Newsboys for having an open heart to let God lead you to create a beautiful album."
5,The 'boys don't disappoint,"As a big Newsboys fan, I have been eagerly awaiting the release of this album. The band comes through, big time, with a CD chock full of great music.The artistic core of the album is tracks 4-7:Thrive (the title track), a beautiful and melodic tune with wonderful lyics (the best lyics on the album in my opinion)Rescue, a lively, upbeat pop song that (like all great songs) sticks in your head and sort of becomes the soundtrack for you life for a few months. (It's my favorite cut on the album, really)It is You- pure, joyous worshipCornelius- an edgy rock song with the serious but somewhat offbeat lyrics the 'boys are known for.Not to say the other songs aren't good (they are), but these four are EXCELLENT and represent the varied musical styles that make this band so much fun to listen to. Every track is a worthy effort, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys music in the rock-and-roll tradition, Christain or not."
4,Good Christian music,"This is goood christian music for new or old christians. The Newsboys' CD is a good rock CD that will give you good, pure songs stuck in your head to remind you of God and His amazing grace."
5,Old school Newsboys,"Somehow I missed this album when it came out, but now that Peter Furler is gone, it's great to hear interesting, catchy songs that I wasn't familiar with before."
3,"Man, my head must be huge!!!!!!!!","Got an XL for a fishing hat and to piss people off because it's so odd looking, but theoretically functional.Thing won't stay on my head when I'm mowing.Most hats don't fit my great big, gravitational field altering noggin.Maybe there should be instructions, like with a condom."
4,It's all right,"My daughter really likes this book, and has for awhile. She is 17 months. She really enjoys it when I sing ""Old MacDonald"" and turn the pages of the book. She also likes to sign ""bunny"" and say ""quack quack"" to the book.I find the pages to be a bit repetitive, however I think this has helped her learn about bunnies and ducks.I do kind of wish that there were more animals on the pages (perhaps more verses of the song). The very last 2 pages have some other animals on them, but she doesn't really find those animals very interesting. (Those pictures are rather bland)."
5,Scott is at his best,"Love this album. Penny, Things Won't is my favorite song. Great album. Wished they'd re-release it."
1,I do hope this is Jakob,I was shocked by the garbage music of the samples listed on this page because i had just been discovering Jakob on YouTube and peaking out like i was on acid. i have been tripping on explosions in the sky lately. The previous review was helpful because I decided to Order.
1,Save your money. Buy the CANON battery.,"I've had this battery 11 months. It has seen limited use and I have alternated it with my Canon battery that came with the camera. They have both seen similar use.This battery worked great for the first 2 or 3 months. After that, it severely degraded to the point that now I can only take 10 pictures or so before it needs recharging.In contrast the Canon-supplied battery takes several hundred photos with the same charge and still retains it's charge.This battery is way to unreliable. I've lost several photo opportunities because of it. I'm tossing it and replacing it with one from Canon."
1,Save your money,"I used this product for canon rebel xti camera. This product worked good for 1-2 months, in fact it's life was comparable to that of the canon battery pack. But after 2-3 months its life just plummeted and now i can take 10-15 shots and that even without flash. It barely lasts to fire 2-3 shots with flash. I would say go for a original canon battery even if you are looking for a back-up cell."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought two of these batteries in September for my Rebel XTI. By December, one battery was completely dead (would not charge) and the other is down to only a few minutes of useful time before it dies. It's cheap, but you get what you pay for."
5,Replacement Battery,I bought three of thes batteries as my wife is taking a photography class. The replacement batteries have a higher amperage rating than the OEM ones. They have really come in handy on photo field trips.
4,Excellent Replacement Battery,"The battery is a perfect fit for a Canon Powershot (purchased 2002) which is now to be my 10-yr old grandchild's first ""practice"" camera. After an initial full-charging, the battery took a ""fast"" charge when it was near discharge and functioned perfectly. Power-life between charges well exceeds that of the original battery. I'm quite pleased with this price-wise product."
5,Works fine!,Works as advertised. No issues so far. Have had good experience with eForCity in the past and again this was a great deal and seems to be a quality product.I have used this in 2 Canon cameras: s50 and XTi.
5,Works great,Purchased for my XTi. I've used them for over a year and they still hold a lot of charge for a long time.
2,XTi battery,"Bought 2 of these and only one worked on arrival. Company returned my money for both and I kept one. It works. Charges and it works. But I still do not fully rely on it as I wouldn't be too surprised if one day it just stopped working.Buy if you're a photographer as a hobby. If you're a professional or seeking professional status and you have clients paying you, get the more reliable true Canon battery."
3,"Performance degrades quickly, but worth the price","I've been using this as a backup to the Canon battery on my Rebel XTi; I've had it for about 11 months. It's to the point now where it doesn't last very long and doesn't hold its charge if left unused for long periods.At first it had very good performance, lasting about as long as the Canon. But as other reviews note, performance degrades pretty dramatically over time.Still, it has come in handy enough times when I accidentally let my Canon battery run low that it has been worth it. I still carry it with me, and occasionally, when I really need to take a shot or 10 and my main battery is down, it pays off. I never trust it when I'm transferring images to the computer anymore, though."
5,my review,i love working out with leslie sansone. her dvd's are very easy to work out to. this is definitely a first rate fitness dvd.
3,A little disappointed,"I have used Leslie's tapes/dvds for years and I have REALLY enjoyed using them, but this one was a bit disappointing. First of all, she is by herself--I do like them better in a group; secondly, she doesn't seem to be into this workout like she usually is and the first mile was nothing but knee lifts and side steps! I like a well rounded mile and expect that with her workouts. Finally, she demonstrates using two different toning bands in this workout..but there's only one in the pkg. I realize the pkg. said there was only one; however, why would she use two of them then in the workout? I do have other bands, but I thought that was disappointing. I probably won't use this one as much. I really like the ones with the weighted gloves--it's a GOOD workout! and also the other 5 mile boosted one...but this one is not my favorite one at all. sorry, Leslie! I really love you!"
2,Sadly Disappointed,"I have several Leslie Sansone ""Walk"" videos and I love them all. So, when this one came out in 2011, I was so excited! That excitment, unfortunately, turned into disappointment. First of all, Leslie is doing this class all by herself, which takes away from much of the fun and energy of the program. Also, I found the music to be quite annoying and extremely difficult to hear! Leslie Sansone has plenty of really great walking videos -- this one doesn't happen to be one of them."
4,exercise for the older gal (71 years) ...,"I like exercising in private. And this is a nice way for me to keep moving in addition to walking the dog. With my two knee replacements, yoga and floor exercises are out. Her exercise bands (hardest part) are a nice addition. I appreciate Leslie Sansone's cheerfulness and encouragement. I only wish her laugh was less grating. But, clearly, she seems so positive and kind. And some of the people she uses in her demos look like real folks and not exercise gurus."
5,Love the workout,"Leslie Sansone's Walk if Off and Tone it Up: I have several of Leslie Sansone's Walking DVD's and I love every one of them. This walking workout is perfect for me because I don't have a good place to walk in my neighborhood and there is something wrong about driving to a gym to exercise. This DVD includes a ""Firm Band"" and Leslie shows you how to exercise with the firm band while walking. It is a good workout and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to exercise at home. My TOPS group is buying her DVD's to give as prizes for our biggest losers"
4,Only 1 band received,"Bought Sansone's DVD for self fitness use, the package only contained one band instead of two, as it showed at the beginning of the DVD, and also mentioned by Leslie during the program. Luckily I have one thinner band at home that can sub the one missing in the package.The program is good, I can do 2, 3, 4 miles, and all with sweat."
1,Very bad remakes,"It's admirable that these young musicians would pay homage to Arthur,Bryan,and Johnny. However save your ears and money and just buy the real best of package by Rhino called ""Love Story"". The remake of Alone Again Or on this compilation is the worst I have ever heard. If you want to hear a good remake version listen to The Damned. The performances and musicianship on this album don't stand up to what the songs deserve."
1,"where did they find these ""artists""?","I thank heaven for the sampling feature. I listened to excerpts from about half of these tracks and only have one comment: is this a travesty or a joke? No talent and mostly out of tune, I can feel AL turning over in his grave."
3,Need something sweet but sugar free?,"Good for that ""just got to have something sweet"" moment when you shouldn't have hardly any more calories for the day. Pineapple rocks! Only eat a few at a time, though. Too many at one sitting gave me gas and the runs!"
5,Just Plain Beautiful Joyous Music,"Hard to believe there was ever a time that I thought 'Cajun' was exotic. Now I see it as 'Americana', with a slight twist. If you're already familiar with Cajun music then this is a must-add for your collection. If not then this is a great place to start. Marc and Ann Savoy have been making beautiful music for many years now, and with the addition of the rest of their family they not only continue but broaden their musical tradition. This CD is so much fun. I had the pleasure of seeing them perform this last weekend at 'Fitzgeralds' and what a show! It's always nice to see people waltzing but there was some serious footstompin' when the Savoy Family revved things up. Marc and Ann don't let it it get too out of hand but their sons, Joel and Wilson, really kinda kicked out the jams. See them live if you get the chance. The slower songs are achingly pretty(so is Ann!) and the faster dance numbers build up like a runaway train. Whew!This is a fabulous CD!"
1,0 stars ... do not buy this,All this is is a reprint from someone recommending that people buy this book. I can't believe Amazon thinks they can charge $6 for this.
3,Excellent Tools for Bullying Prevention: Choose Language with Caution,"An excellent resource for the classroom teacher who is interested in reducing bullying in the classroom. One word of caution for this book and all similar books: Language that identifies children as bullies and refers to them as bullies must be regarded with caution. Labeling children as bullying is ""name calling"" and a bullying behavior itself. Also, be cautious with any text that make global or narrow statements about why people bully."
4,Excellent Read,"Andrea Peacock did an excellent job of describing theenvironmental disaster that has ravaged this smallMontana town.Peacock's description of human suffering,corporate greed, and ""bought"" politicians bringsthis true story to life.Highly recommended reading."
1,Sentimental,"This catastrophe deserved a more comprehensive treatment. ""When one person dies, it is a tragedy. When thousands die, it is war."" What happened in Libby, Montana was like war on a population, but this book treats it like several personal tragedies. The W.R. Grace Company is a corporation without a conscience and deserves to be indicted for its crimes, not be allowed to avoid all responsibility by going into and then out of bankruptcy unscathed. The book on what happened in Libby still needs to be written."
4,the polarization,The polarization is a very important issues today that we need to explore everything about this issues. The rewiew in this book is very generel and not specifiec in ters of the polarization.
4,better than most other brands,"This shirt is thicker than the others I've tried in the same price range; it doesn't look cheap or flimsy at all, and it feels good. If the color selection were better I'd have given it 5 stars. I'm 5'1'' and 100 lbs., sort of thin but I don't have much of a waistline; and as I get older my abdomen looks rounder. I wear some smalls and some mediums, and in this shirt I needed the medium."
3,Good shirt but runs small,"These are soft and really great thermals, however the sizing is off, they are very fitted and not roomy, if you're looking for a loose fit order a size up"
3,"Friday Foster-Vhs- Not that good. Watch ""Coffy"".but Pam Is in it!So...Still worth watching.","This movie compared to Coffy,is not that good, but Pam Is in it, and it's worth the watch, I feel it drags on at times. The good thing is the movie has a More positive spin compared to other movies of the genre,and with Most Pam Movies, it's not as violent or negative."
3,Would be a disaster if not for Pam,"Pam Grier's magnetic personality and spunky character pretty much save this otherwise outrageously stupid and trashy film. Yaphet Kotto is pretty good too, in a low-key way. Other than that, it has all the stuff that keeps Blaxploitation films form being taken seriously (if they were ever meant to be in the first place). Horrbile acting, atrocious dialogue, cornball story, poorly staged fight scenes, ad nauseum. My parents forbade me from seeing this when it first came out (I was 11 at the time). Now I see why."
4,Better Than Expected,"Most of us are aware of the great cover of Madonna's ""Like A Prayer"" by Madhouse, so it was with a bit of trepidation that I purchased the entire album, as one never knows! I was pleasantly surprised, as most of the songs are quite good, and do justice to the original versions. Other standouts are ""Frozen"" and ""La Isla Bonita"". Overall, a good purchase!"
2,Storaro: The Elements,"I saw this book,which might have been pretty good like thefirst book in this series,But Storaro for some reason makesdouble exposures for most of the frame blow upsWhy I don't know,Its really strange,the films don't lookthat way."
5,Great Product!,This storage box is a great buy! It's remarkably durable and long lasting! Would buy this product again in a heartbeat!
5,Works for me,"I like Plano stuff to begin with.First of all, the hinges are really ""hinges"" and not just a cheap flap of plastic that breaks over time. Secondly, the latches are really secure and no matter how this thing gets tossed around, the latches hold and nothing gets spilled out. The plastic compartment partitions are a good fit. There are no gaps at the top or bottom which prevent things - like hooks - from sliding into an adjoining compartment. I slide this Stowaway into a canvas book bag to take with me when I grab my fishing pole."
5,Amazing,"This product had done amazing things for me and it is by far helpful in life. It is something good to listen to while your awake, meditating or sleeping. It is helpful in all ways and all it takes is your will to bend it to do what you're seeking."
1,I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS WORSE!!,"I don't know what is worse. The death and chaos caused by this conflict or the boring, dull voice of Walter Cronkite. If you are looking for actual historical accuracy, you won't get it here. Cronkite instead voices his opinion based on his eye witness account of these events.Half way through, I found myself rooting for the enemy to kill Cronkitejust to shut him up!!! Terrible collection. Don't waste your money."
4,A Good Purchase,"I am really enjoying my new productTactics - The Complete Series""Tactics""... I got it in no time..."
4,"Good product, ok shipping.","The shipping was fast, got here two days early. But upon taking the dvds out, I realized that the fourth disc was not in the case the case was broken and had scratched the disc. The disc is fine plays great, I didn't have to return it. I would buy again just with some caution."
4,Misnamed but still good anime,"A good series but one that's best watched twice to get the setting. Or keep in mind that despite the spirits, demons and ghosts, it's actually set in turn-of-the-century (post Meiji) era. Early episodes do not seem to have a set story line, but set up the running story later. Nicely, the apparent main story line is only a distraction. It's definitely a people oriented story."
1,Save your money,"If this is like the other Wimbledon ""best of"" discs, the following review will apply, and hopefully save you 25 bucks.Total ripoff. Less than an hour including extras, more shots of crowd members than players, and the boring voice-over frequently reminding us that this is the only tennis tournament that really matters doesn't help a whit. A truly pointless dvd with very little tennis. Summing up hundreds of matches in about 30 minutes of footage? You do the math.Might be worth buying only if you were there and hope to see yourself in the many audience shots. Otherwise, with barely any tennis on the disc, what's the point? Pure fluff.Go instead to the infinitely better Classic Matches at Wimbledon series; the Borg/Mac 1980 dvd has more quality in five minutes than this does in 55, and costs half as much.Passola."
4,Track Listing,1. Sama Yie (my Sweet Mother)2. Jaramah Allah3. Makalou4. Adama5. Help The Children6. Asa Bombe7. Senegal8. Sie Sie9. Ali Camara
2,Terrible,"Bought these after my son played with them so well during OT sessions for Sensory Processing. When playing with the ones his OT brought for the session - he loved the feel of the blocks and how he was able to make his action figures and animals and pretend play - so I was SO excited to order these, and after reading reviews was confident I was getting a good product - what a disappointment. They do not stick together, they do not feel very ""bristley"", the plastic bends. . they are terrible. And to top it off, call(s) to the company asking how I can return them was never returned to me. Terrible"
3,Flimsy clamp and blurry instructions,"This kit worked eventually and the parts fit well on my truck, but the little screw clamp which affixes the wire to the lever which move the choke is made out of brass and is far too flimsy for this application. It was a serious disappointment to have it break just as I was finishing the installation. Fortunately, I was able to get a small, steel Chicago bolt which I carefully drilled a hole in for the wire to go through. After enlarging the hole in the lever so that the Chicago bolt would fit through it, I was back in action and the whole setup works very well. The instructions which came with the kit were horrible and almost entirely illegible, but I contacted the company and they emailed me a .pdf version of the instructions which, after I printed it out, was very clear and well written. I would recommend this product to others but with the provision that they be ready to replace the bolt clamp the way I had to."
3,Maverick ET-13,"Too big. I had a smaller Maverick digital that worked better and was smaller. This is large, and takes about 10 to 15 seconds for an accurate read."
3,EEEK what happened??,"Geez this manga was really good for the first three books. I read them awhile ago but after being distracted by about a hundred other titles I just recentlty returned to it. I really did enjoy the other volumes but I don't really like this book of the series.Volume four continues where three left off, their mission completed and now the world's left without a ruler in chaos. What happened to all the light hearted humour? This volume was seriously depressing. There are lots of other manga and anime I can turn to if I want a sad meaningful story but it just didn't seem to fit with this series. Augh why did they have to start turning the series into a freakin' drama. Everyone mopes around and acually APOLOGIZES for acting goofy and rude (but, I mean they were just messing around and having fun) in the first three books. I dunno I may or may not continue this series out of curiosity of how it will end."
2,Not very advanced,"This book reads well, but is only good as a very general overview of the subject. Do not buy this book if you are needing a supplement for a college level course, it does not go into enough detail."
4,"very very good TJ album, which means it's GREAT!!!","PLEASE NOTE: A GAVE THIS ALBUM 4 STARS, AND IT MAY REALLY BE MORE OF A FIVE STAR, BUT AMAZON'S SOFTWARE CHANGED IT TO 3 AND WILL NOT LET ME EDIT THE STAR RATING.If you love any of Tommy James' work, this will not let you down. Sound quality is excellent, the band is smokin', the songs are great. I think this is actually some of the best stuff he's ever recorded, and like all of his best stuff it has me singing along (and grinning like a fool!).Some extremely nice lyrical touches - still pure and easy but with an added maturity. And there are so many incredible vocal moments (individual and harmonic) that it soars!Way to go, Mr. James. Keep on creating new music, we surely need it."
1,"Kill the Birds, Kill the Music",What is it with these recordings with the birds and music? I envisioned myself in a garden with birds on both of my shoulders and an orchastra of rainsoaked musicians. Uhhhhh. Horrible. Help!
1,Horrible item EVER!,"Never and ever buy it! This protector has super-low quality; and most important it's in blue color!? Maybe I was wrong, I couldn't figure out which one this the real protector membrane... But, Again, this one is made in china instead of made in Japan which I had before with GREAT quality. After few mins trying and testing, It's got too many bubble and If you stretched it too much, the shape will not come back... So I teared it into parts and threw it away. I did not even care that 7 bucks I spent... Good luck, buyer -_-\\\\\Buy the correct one made in Japan! Don't worry about reading japanese, all you have to do is follow the picture instruction.Enjoy ur NDS with original HORI protector, Have FUN!"
2,Not so good.,"I purchased this items to protect the screen of my childrens (5 and 10) new DS. One, they do not fit well. Two, they did not stay on my youngest DS. Now this could have been just him, however the fit issue is the biggest downfall for me. Since the covers extend out the edges remain raised off of the screen which makes it difficult to use the pen on the outer areas of the screen. Yesterday I purchased a Nintendo brand cover from a store and had the same fit issue. Frustrating!"
5,the best you're going to get,"They worked great, no glue or mess. As with any film, you have to be extremely careful not to get any dust or dirt between them and get it right the first time but if you mess up and get it dirty you can actually take it off and wash the surface with soap and water getting it like new again (though I don't recommend relying on this).Just be careful and try to get a package in English, mine came in Japanese and I had to guess what to do."
4,"Great cover, but it almost covers the whole screen.","I got this screen protector after I found out it was made in Japan for the DS, and avoided the Pelican brand after reading bad reviews.Screen cover comes in a pair - top and bottom. Instructions are clearly written but it does not cover the whole screen so size up the screen protector to your DS screen and then start the process.Warning: The screen protectors are sandwiched between two plastic holders (you'll know what I mean when you get it) once you put the bottom screen protector on, there is a tab that helps remove the screen protector's top layer, be careful because the top layer for the protector can be removed off the DS screen by lifting it, so use caution.I already have it on for about a month, heavy use and shows little or no wear. A must for DS users."
4,good,"this only works well IF you put it on well. i read all the reviews and i was deciding to buy it or not buy it...let's get straight to the facts.you will not get all the dust out. you will have some on your screen. just staring at you. YES, this sucks. but if you do it right, they will hardly be noticeable. same with the air bubbles. the reviews said they go away on their own, so i'm still waiting for that.as much as the reviews said you dont have a second try, to me, i did. i actually put it on 3 times on the touch screen. here's a tip:get some really sticky tape with you, so you can get the dust out as you put it on. this is the most help i can give you.edit:im proud to say that all air bubbles are gone...after reapplying both again.this thing WORKS, as long as you do it right."
2,"Decent protection, impossible to remove.","They seem to be doing their job. During application I was trying to be extra careful but I still managed to get dirt and air bubbles. I put the screens onto my DS lite and then that was it. I could not seem to remove the things for the life of me. I've tried all sorts of tape and they refuse to budge. I don't want to use a needle or something like that and risk scratching the screen so now I'm stuck with protective layers and debris staring me in the face. I feel that with normal careful use, screen protectors are not necessary."
2,Great but hard to apply,This screen protector was good but it was very hard to apply. Dust kept entering the screen and it was impossible to apply without getting air bubbles. The protector also does not cover the whole screen. It also leaves an unprotected border around the bottom and top screen so it's not real good.
5,"Does the job but ""Removable?"" I don't see how.","The top filter went on fine. I got bubbles on the screen protector install. Its adhesive is extremely aggressive. Fortunately, the bubbles don't show when the screens light up. I can't imagine being able to remove the stylus protector (as the manufacturer suggests) to replace it.The product does its job so I can't fault it for that. It's already showing some wear after two weeks of my daughter playing on it but I can see it lasting several more months before I somehow replace the protector with a new one. It sure beats scratching up the DS Lite pad."
1,Very disappointed,"I wanted to protect my new DS and thought these filters would do the job. I only wanted one for the bottom screen to protect it from the stylus. When putting it on, I got a few air bubbles and wanted to try again. The instructions say to use a piece of tape to lift up the filter; this did not work at all. I decided to forget about the air bubbles but then felt the filter was preventing the stylus from making good contact with the screen. I found this too frustrating and wanted to remove the filter. This was almost impossible as I didn't want to damage the screen in the struggle to lift up a corner of the filter. Finally I did get the filter off and into the nearest wastebasket. Only $7 but a complete waste of money."
3,Not quite impressed...,"I purchased this screen protector thinking I must protect the Nintendo DS screen I recently gave to my son. Well, the instructions were in Japanese so I have to make do with the illustrations. The upper screen protector was easy; did it only once. But the lower touch screen was a headache. Not only was the protector a little bigger but I couldn't get rid of the bubbles!I have to cut it, do it several times and finally when everything seems to fit perfectly, it was filled with dust. I had to use my extra iPad screen protector by cutting it in its exact DS measurement.Such a hassle! I would not recommend this highly."
5,Does what it should,"Pretty good product. Did end up with bubbles as told I would by a previous reviewer, and going by what they said I will leave it as is and hope they will disappear. That reviewer is also what sold me on it.$7 seems kinda pricey (Prime makes it a steal though), but all in all it's a good value. The top screen cover is made specifically for the top screen, as it is reflective. The bottom cover is made specifically for the bottom as well."
3,must have for your ds,"easy to use, seamless protection for both screens on your ds. even if a bubble forms, you can easily rub it to the edge to eliminate it. protect your investment and prolong the life of the high quality screens on your ds. highly recommend."
4,good,good product but i don't good with how to stick it to nds lite.but the product quality is good.
1,UGH!!!!,I had no patience with either of the romantic leads. All either one of them seem to do is whine about why they shouldn't love each other. I never felt any passion or sparks or any other feelings between them. Nor did I ever have the notion that their respective jobs really meant anything to them.It just seemed the author just strung some words together with no idea of how to convey real emotions and Zebra published those words. Maybe it was a slow month for editors and they had to take what they could get.Don't waste your money on this one!
2,slow reading!,I am having a hard time reading this one. Nikki is so incompetent as a guardian it just annoys me!! She's a real disaster in the kitchen! I'm only halfway through this and I hope it'll get better as I read further!
2,Sounds OK; fit is questionable.,"Despite good sound on my end and no complaints from friends on the other end, I've returned mine. I wasn't able to get a secure fit from the over-the-ear design. Under the slightest tug from the cord, the unit would shift out of position, and when the little eargel doesn't line up exactly with your ear canal, you can't hear your caller anymore. I also found it to be irritating when wearing glasses."
5,GREAT hands-free device!!!,This device is light as can be and the clarity is exceptional. I strongly recommend it whether for driving or normal talking.
1,Very disappointed,"Died after around 6 months' gentle, non-abusive use.Apparently from reading other consumers' reviews also, I'm far from alone.VERY much too much money for such a lifespan.I'm not buying another one.Edited: Oh, I forgot to say that for while it worked, it was EXTREMELY too loud, right out of the box. Minimum-Volume-adjusting the phone didn't help. I had to remove the eargel and insert a compacted, wadded up chunk of soft foam and pack it down dense & tight over the earpiece speaker to subdue it to an acceptable range, before replacing the eargel over it.Should NOT have to do this."
2,Meh,"Sound is good. A little too loud for my tastes, no matter how low I turned down my phone. But it was clear. Unfortunately people on the other end said I sounded distant and was hard to understand. They would have to go to a room that was absolutely quiet for us to carry on the conversation."
5,Paula's Thriller Album,"""Forever your Girl"" is probally the greatest dance record ever.All of the cuts are fantastic.The first time I heard ""Straight Up,"" I knew this was a HIT,but when I saw the video,I was blown away.Paula Abdul had what they call IT.If I was only to have a couple records from the 80's,this would be one of them."
4,Pure pop fluff fun,"Ahhh... it's amazing what we think is cool when we are 14, eh? Just listening to this CD now in 2000 is like listening to a soundtrack of junior high. Back then, it was a fierce R&B-tinged pop album with strong rhythms and excellent production; today, it's more of a paint-by-numbers wafer-thin voice warbling over a drum track. No one ever called Paula Abdul a great singer -- sometimes it gets so bad, it sounds like she is singing underwater -- but at times, the production here *is* top-notch. ""Cold Hearted"" and ""Knocked Out"" are simply two good-sounding, danceable songs. Verdict? Dated lightweight pop that's just fun, with no real substance -- just like eating frosting right out of the tub."
5,One Of The Best Of The 80's!,"Without any doubt, this smash debut album by Paula Abdul is one of the best pop albums from the 80's! It's such an uplifting, diverse, appealing, energy-filled, likeable and catchy album! Paula's voice is warm and sugary, just the way dance pop should be. ""Straight Up"" is the winner here, a striking and infectious pop song that makes you want to dance. ""Cold Hearted"" is another strong dance track with a funky, electronic melody and vocal arrangment. ""Opposites Attract"" delivers a more 90's side of Paula, dueting with a sleek, troublesome cat with smooth rap. I also like the title track, a sort of jazz/pop blend, ""The Way That You Love Me"" and ""Knocked Out."" Altogether, you can't go wrong here. The amazing music videos are only topping on the cake. Buy it if you don't already own it today!"
3,"Paula,Paula.Paula",I actually like this album inspite of her lack of true singing.Paula is a talented woman and always has been beautiful.However her voice is very thin and it sounds like she talks the song but she pulled it off very well and her Forever You Girl album is one of the biggest selling debut albums in history.I favor the song Cold Hearted that song is very good some others.I think she did an ok job as a singer but better job as a dancer.
2,Nothing to write home about,"I remember how big a deal this disc was back in the late 80s, but I just never got it...or her. The ""Straight Up"" and ""Forever Your Girl"" songs were awful pop tunes and that ""Opposites Attract"" video was just plain awful with the obnoxious animated cat. Then the allegations surfaced that she never really sang leads on the album. I did like the ""Way That You Love Me"" song. Now that was pretty sweet."
2,2.5 Stars,"Some songs are good (especially ""Straight Up""), but some songs aren't as good. Anyway, it's pretty good to listen to."
2,ABDUL DOESN'T HOLD UP WELL INTO THE NEW MILLENIUM.,"I decided recently to pull out my old vinyl of Paula Abdul and spin this baby.Well I have noticed since I am now about 11 years older I realized Abdul's voice now gets on my nerves, and that her songs though they had their place and time in 1989 just don't hold up well today.Songs like ""Straight Up"", ""Knocked Out"", and ""The Way That You Love Me"", just don't infect me like some old pop songs do like The Emotions ""Best of My Love"" or Lovin' Spoonfuls ""Summer in the City""....get the picture?Unless your an Abdul fanatic, all I can say is this is really run of the mill pop with some infectious hooks...I think if Madonna, or Deborah Gibson (who have stronger voices) sang these dittys they may hold up better."
1,where to start,"she should have stuck with choreographing for the lakers. Miss Abdul's voice is just.... well not suited to sing. It isn't great, and most of the time it sounds strained. The songs pretty much stink in any era.. even the late eighties early nineties."
1,A template drowning in rudimentary business babble,"I was disappointed - the obvious differentiator for this book is the worksheets to create what will ultimately be a standard, templated Marketing Plan.Unfortunately that can only be accomplished by wading through lessons on Rudimentary Business including blinding insight such as ""Coupons are certificates, usually paper that can be used by your customers . . ."" (p. 287) and ""the only good marketing strategy is one you can successfully execute"" (p. 110). This is juxtaposed with the (unfounded) arrogance of comments like: ""these three sections are an integrated course that every MBA program should include and that almost none actually do."" (p. xvi).[...]"
4,Exactly what it purports to be.,This is really information you can use. The author provides forms to fill out at each step of the process and points you to helpful information resources along the way. It is not about revolutionary new strategies or marketing fads. It is about thinking through your marketing planning in a way that will yield insights and help with decision making. As far as I can tell every company does marketing planning differently and this book has something to offer for most all of them.
1,One mistake in the book cause me to doubt the entire book.,"Horror! Page 8 has a mistake so bad it makes me doubt the entire book, ""The first semi-conductor...was discovered ...in 1965... It took seven more years before the first commercial application appeared..."" I beg to differ. I was working in Fairchild Semiconductor, Inc. in Mountain View, California designing integrated circuits in 1964. I must be dreaming then or the the author in talking about some other technology. It makes me wonder about the rest of the book."
5,blue coral wipes,I just recently picked up a older honda accord from my son. It needed some major TLC. Using these blue cotal wipes helped bring the cloth seats back to life. Thanks Rusty.
4,Falconry: Art and Practice,"As a somewhat informed novice, I found this book very interesting and informative. It has good descriptions of the birds used in falconry as well as thorough beginning training techniques. However, the buyer should know this book was written for falconry in the UK. Topics such as governing laws, terrain terms and types of quarry are often ""foreign"" to ours in the U.S."
3,This book Is somewhat Vauge on the things you needs to know,It is a good book to learn most of the terms used in modern day falconry and also gives some insight on the ancient history on hunting with birds. It's desings for mews are quite elaborate and just not practical in some cases. It does though give excellent instuctions for makeing your own hood and pigieon harnesses.
4,"Uh, I liked it","Man, people hate on this record. Doesn't it seem unfair to expect that an artist as prolific as Sizzla drop a masterpiece every single time. The poor guy, nothing he ever does will stop being compared to Black Woman and Child. Granted, that album is probably his magnum opus, but that was 1997. In all fairness, he's probably too prolific for his own good. He has released something like 28 records since 1997 which is almost absurd when you think about it. And while I agree that some of his albums are well, not so good, Taking Over for example, I think Bobo Ashanti is a great record. Everytime I think Sizzla has fallen off he comes back with something like this or The Real Thing, which I also think is a great record. ""Whether or Not"", ""This Day"", and ""Wicked..."" are excellent Sizzla tracks and I can listen to this CD the whole way through. I strongly recommend this album to any Sizzla or contemporary reggae fan. Well deserving of 4 stars in my opinion."
2,Inferior Sizzla Release,"I agree with the reviewer below. How can the 2nd Edition of Rough Guide to Reggae rate this as ""Essential""? This release should not be compared to such masterpieces as ""Black Woman & Child"" and ""Royal Son of Ethiopia"". A real disappointment which is evidenced by the number of used copies floating around waiting to be purchased!"
3,Unclear quantity/ product description,"This product is fine. Amazon's listing is wrong though. There were two choices when I placed my order: ""One dispenser per pack"" for $3.09 or ""Two dispensers per pack"" for $3.99. I ordered ""Two dispensers per pack"" but only got one. Not worth trying to figure out where this would fit in Amazon's maze of customer service options for losing out on $0.90. Live and learn. ""Two dispensers per pack"" really means ""One dispenser"" with a total of 96 flags. Amazon should fix the listing."
3,White Shadow Connection...,"The best thing about this movie is seeing Joan Pringle topless. She was the principal on the ""White Shadow"" broadcast on CBS. Most impressive."
5,JD's Revenge,"Arrived just as expected, would recommend seller to anyone, great job and I will look forward to doing business with you again. A+++"
5,J.D.'s revenge,Everything was great. The item was exactly as stated. I received it a little earlier than expected
3,THIS WAS A SURPRISING FUN MOVIE TO WATCH,"DURING THE SO CALLED BLACK FILM ERA;OFTHE 70'S THIS WAS ONE OF THE BETTER MADEBUT,ALAS LEAST WATCHED MOVIES OF THAT-PERIOD ."
5,"Grab this one, Oceanic art collectors and would-be collectors","I can scarcely add anything to the three lengthy and enticing reviews already here, except to say ""I second those emotions"" and that when the book came last night and I scanned through its hundreds of plates, I was deeply grateful that I somehow found this magnificent work I've been wanting at such a great price. Mine is the one volume version of the two volumes, and must weigh 30 pounds, so it will live on the coffee table where it can serve as constant great art and war club. Photography excellent, to the extent that if you open the book at random you may scare yourself silly as one old god or another glares out at you. No time to write a thesis, just wanted to say there are about 10 more used copies at great prices (under $50) - get yours, like-minded ones."
3,Sam's Review,"After reading the other reviews I was excited to get this book. Now that I have the book it's not that phenomenal and I can see why it has the price tag that it does. First of all half of the 640pgs is art from Papua New Guinea. This isn't a bad thing if you are into PNG art, but I bought this book mainly for Polynesian art, and I thought it was lacking in this area.The Marquesas section was decent but the New Zealand section was disappointing. Hawaii was also sad along with Tonga, Fiji and Easter Island. The objects presented in the book aren't even that rare, they are easily accessible on the open art market, except for maybe a handful of the objects presented. That and the very brief object write-up says save your money and buy an auction catalog for the same price or buy Pacific Encounters: The Art of Divinity in Polynesia less pages but better pieces to look at it and study"
3,Informative Book For Jewelry Appraisers,Informative and detailed book for anyone starting out in jewelry appraising. Book needs to be updated for the current times regarding internet research and resources.
3,"Good, but can not read SDHC card",I was sad to find I can not read my SDHC (too new ?) card with this 64 in 1 reader and have to buy another one.
1,Broken pins and no response from customer care,"I purchased this unit in Dec 2007 and by March a couple of pins in the CF slot had already bent which made that slot unusable. of course this is more than 30 days after the purchase, so Amazon won't take it back.I tried emailing Sabrent twice and never even got a response. This product was not high quality and there is no customer support to back up these defective units. I would not recommend buying their products."
2,not worth it,"I had this about 6 months before it crapped the bed. It worked fine until one day none of the cards inserted into it showed up in ANY OS (being a network engineer I tried this in about 4 different machines and 7 different OSes) After thorough testing, I declared it Dead and ordered another cheapy that has last me at least 12 months and is still kicking."
1,not satisfied,my expectations for this item were quite high despite the fact that it is considerably cheap!!! I should've known better the item fails to start o my pc or mac it has a rounded window titled power that i believe its supposed to turn on but it doesn't unfortunately i couldn't returned it due that i missed the paperwork that comes with it!!!my advice spend few more bucks on brands more reliable than this one such a belkin
1,small card reader,"The price on the tiny card reader was reasonable but after I removed it from the packing, I noticed that the lable said that it was for a NOTEBOOK coomputer, and I have a desktop! I was upset and angry that it was not disclosed in the online description. Since it was already out of the packing, I plugged it in and it seems to be working. The 4 ports are too close together and I can only use 3 of them.I feel betrayed and a bit stupid for apparently buying the wrong thing.I hope better descriptions will follow."
3,lazy edition,I didn't read all of it but the code samples in the first 3 chapters has a terrible mismatch with variables names. Some of the chapter's paragraphs are repeating them self.I got the feeling they get to rush in this edition.But you should take into account that i'm very pedantic.Search inside before you make your decision.
2,Too many bugs in the codes.,"I bought this book several months ago and was disappointed. One of the problem is that I am consistently debugging the codes. I am at Chapter 5 now and have spent numerous times googling to try to understand what is the correct syntex for some codes, such as using xml method for column-level contraints, which was demonstated in the book, but does not work. The other thing I don't like is the lack of explanation about the code examples. Many times, a code was throw out without clear explantion, such as how cross apply, outer apply works."
4,Very happy,I got this for my husband for Xmas. I ended up giving it to him early because I couldn't wait any more. He was thrilled. It took almost three weeks to get it but it was worth it.The album is full of great stuff even if you are not Already a fan.
1,Not one of Kasey Michaels' better works...,"Unfortunately, ""The Promise"" isn't one of Kasey's better works... The storyline is very predictable.. and everything else is so predictable... Your heart certainly wouldn't miss a beat even if you don't read this book!"
1,Ensemble Unnamed for a Reason,"It sounds like a mediocre college (or pretty good high school) band. Clams and clunkers (wrong or misplaced notes) abound. The director had so little confidence in the piccolo that he had it lay off of the solo the first time through (when the rest of the band plays softly) the famous part of Stars & Stipes Forever. The recording quality is on a par with the musicianship. Sousa deserves much better.Correction (1/5/03): They didn't have the piccolo lay out, but they didn't take the last repeat (which is indicated pianissimo the first time through and fortissimo the second) - they play it once, loud. As written, the famous melody (""be kind to your web-footed friends"") occurs three time, the first in the Trio, with no piccolo obligato. It's still wrong."
4,"Expensive, but a nice fit.","These were not as easy to install as I had envisioned, and involved some body contortion and having to find a jack to make room under the wheel well because of my 35-inch tires. I have one gripe about the instructions: A warning on the first page IN BOLD TYPE would have been nice, alluding to the fact that the back of these flares are VERY SHARP. This might have prevented me from cutting the palm of my hand (#@!!) when taking them out of the plastic bagging they came in. They do however fit very nicely. $354 is huge chunk of change when you consider that they cost maybe a few dozen dollars to make from a mold. I realize you're paying for research and development, but it's still a little high. These two mentions are what kept me from giving it a 5-star rating."
5,Great Artist,"I heard one of these songs in a Rob Pattinson film (Remember Me), ""Hanging with the wrong crowd"" and loved it. But after listening to the whole album, its all good. Now its one of my fav cd's"
5,Your next classic,"I have heard the second track, Protect your soul, on the radio and immediately felt uplifted. If you wish the Pixies, Tom Waits (dare I say Beatles?) put out a new album, I think you'll enjoy this one. This is one terrific buy!"
5,Change for a lifetime,"I first heard Circle in 1971 when a friend introduced me. It was back in the days of recording from the vinyl over to cassette tape. I suppose I wore out several sets of cassettes listening to it over and over in the car. This album changed my music love for the rest of my life. It introduced me to Doc and Merle, Mother Maybelle, Roy Acuff, and even though they didn't play on it, in round about ways to Gram, Emmylou, Sam Bush, Tony Rice, Seldom Scene and the host of bluegrass and real country music stars.Every song is timeless, I've listened to them countless times. I know them all by heart. Circle ""one"" would be that one set of songs I would take to the deserted island to listen to over and over forever.Thanks to those hippies from Colorado who had the vision to team up with the greats of Nashville and change my music life forever."
3,Not the greatest,"I purchased all 3 volumes of this set, and vol 2 & 3 are much better. Vol 1 is 80% instrumental, I prefer more vocal."
1,Babbling,"The music was good but there is so much unintelligible babbling and talk before each song that is was a pain to listen to. On one track, Mother Maybelle mentioned that she was going to play the autoharp when doing Wild Flower but that was not the song played. The other conversations were garbled and did little to add to the listening. If they would have eliminated the crosstalk, they could have added 5 more songs to the CD. I'm sorry that I bought it."
3,Pretty Good,"I never have seen the need to have recorded conversations between musicians at the start of the several songs on the CD. You'd be hard pressed to find large groups of people who all like the same musician or groups. As a representation of diff. country styles, this is fine, but if you're a fan of Doc's and not of Maybelle's, (or others), then you'll find yourself pushing the 'next track' button often. I bought this cd because of Scruggs, but I've been made a fan of Doc's, and that's a good point. So, I have mixed feelings about it."
4,The Circle stays unbroken,"With this rerelease a new generation can relearn the tradition of pure country that has influncenced not only nashville purists but rock as well. Much as John Hammond preserved blues traditions, The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band has recorded tradional songs with tradional artists that would have been forgotten to this generation raised on Nashville star and American Idol. The importance of this music can be seen in the resurgence of traditonal country music and and its impact on rock and roll in the movie ""Walk the Line"" where the two are virtually inseparable in Sam Phillips Memphis and the million dollar quartet.This Album is a must for anyone interested in the history of country,rock or pop music."
5,I just want to read more of Lee's books!,"I love his style. I love his humor. I love his sick, raunchy, disturbing storyline.I can't wait to read more & more...."
5,Lee's On The Top Of My List,"I'm into horror novels and I picked this one up in my local library looking for something different. Boy did I get it! I got sucked in and could hardly put it down. I took the book everywhere I thought I could sneak in a couple pages. It was first rate. Edward Lee has moved to the very top of my list for must reads. Too bad my library doesn't carry much horror fiction, I'd be in there constantly. Initially I was disappointed with the ending, but after thinking I came to the conclusion that if it had been any other way, I would have REALLY been disappointed. Creekers is the first book by Edward Lee that I've read, but it certainly won't be the last..."
5,Very useful DBA book !,"I have been an Oracle DBA for the last 7 years and have used Oracle7, Oracle8 extensively. I usually buy quite a few Oracle books for my reference. I must say that this Oracle8i DBA Book is very well written and has a totally new format, the Questions and answers which guides the reader on how to implement the feature. I must say that the scripts that are available for download are very accurate and useful. The replication topic was excellent and I was able to replicate my two database fairly quickly. Partitioning has been covered in detail and with good examples. If you want to implement standby database then this is the book, it provides A to Z on it with examples. This book is much better than any other Oracle Press book on Database Administration. I have already used this book on a number of occasions and I think the author has done a good job in providing an easy-to-read book. I highly recomend this for intermediate to advanced DBA. - Good luck !"
2,Not the Soundtrack,This CD is songs from the movie but not the Original Soundtrack. Jane Froman sings truncated versions of the songs from the movie. OK but really where is the OST.
4,A brilliant chamber musical that's both chilling and moving.,"I was lucky enough to catch a workshop production of this show in New York a few years ago, and I can't believe it hasn't had a major production yet. The show itself is an extremely compelling chamber musical with only 12 cast members. Its main theatrical conceit is telling Lizzie Borden's story through Lizzie as an adult and Lizzie as a child. This echo effect is what gives the show its heart and also makes it chilling. Instead of a whodonnit, it's more of a whydunnit. The music in the show - and in the nicely produced CD - is wonderful. There are several memorable songs, some of which merit recordings by major voices. My favorite is ""House On The Hill."" Broadway veteran Alison Fraser gives a lovely performance as Lizzie and it would be great to see her open this on Broadway. The show also has some comic tunes, which relieve the tension created by the story and music. I would compare this most to ""Sweeney Todd."""
5,Outstanding! A must have for all musical theatre buffs.,"Christopher McGovern & Amy Powers have created a brilliant work of art - one that deserves to be seen and heard. In a musical about Lizzie Borden, I expected songs about murder, but I didn't expect the heart-wrenchingly beautiful, the humorous, or the many other varied types of songs. I've already purchased more CDs to give to friends. I'll cross my fingers that it comes to a theatre near me soon."
5,Lizzie Borden - A Stunning new musical,"The musicalization of Lizzie Borden could have easily been something to fear but with this new musical recording, you'll want to hear it again and again. Christopher Mc Govern's music lures you, uplifts you, romances you and then horrifies you. The story of Lizzie unfolds song after song and the strong lyrics and story will hypnotize and amaze you. Alsion Fraser finds the passion in Lizzie and sores through the score makeing it impossible to imagine anyone else more perfect. All I can say is Invite Lizzie Borden into your home and you'll never want her to leave."
5,This one I will continue to support!!!,"I now have the entire office listening and often even REQUESTING that I put this CD on.. NO KIDDING!! I am glad to know that this music, that has only had the benefit of a workshop production has found the following it has. If there is any justice, there will come a time when a producer will come to his senses and put this one off-Broadway or Broadway.. When that time comes I'll have the pleasure of knowing I was one of the first people to have the benefit of such brilliant songs as HOUSE ON THE HILL and FLY AWAY.."
5,Great emotion! I got a real connection with the story!,"I love ""Lizzie Borden""! The music is so lush and emotional. It drives the story and gives the listener a connection with the dramatic action.""The House on the Hill"" is such a beautiful melody and the lyrics of ""I Cry Alone"" just wrench your heart out. ""The Maggie Work"" is such fun and very clever. The voices are fabulous and I just love to listen to it."
5,pretty impressive,"I usually get bored with house/acid jazz/electronica sounds. They are usually too repetitive for my taste, with some exceptions.This is one of the exceptions. Impressive sounds and variety."
3,Okay Music,"I've owned Mr. Scruff's cd's for a while, and they are easy listening.Unfortunately, if you want to be challenged musically, this cd won't do it."
3,Mr. Scruff - Trouser Jazz,"On the heels of his success with KEEP IT UNREAL, Mr. Scruff quickly offered TROUSER JAZZ. This album, however, feels a bit rushed and not quite as realized. For one, the songs seem to lack direction or development; ""Shrimp"" is an example. It's catchy, yes, but it also goes nowhere. Even the cut-up end track ""Ahoy There!"" (again celebrating aquatic life) doesn't feel completely thought through. But tracks like the dark-hued ""Beyond"" or its equally mysterious brother, ""Valley of the Sausages"" (with Seaming pulling an Yma Sumac) go a long way in giving the album some pep. ""Come on Grandad"" encourages you to pull up your trouser legs and shimmy. Still fun, but certainly not as accomplished as his earlier work."
1,Useless with compact fluorescents,"Product only can be used with incadescent lights. This is as the unit leaks current when in the 'off' position. This will kill a CF very early in its life, defeating the long-life rating of a CF. No mention of this factor anywhere on the packaging until you open it up and look at the technical information packet. Considering most of the US homes today utilize compact fluorescents to some degree, I feel this deficiency of the product to be unacceptable and the fact it's ""hidden"" from you until you open it up just disgusts me!"
3,"works, but only for incandescent lights","This switch works as advertised, but only with incandescent lights. The remote switch did not work properly if there was a CFL in the light socket. The wall switch worked with a CFL but would leave it flickering oddly for a while when switched off."
2,Spuratic,It maybe to close to my wifi router but sometimes it works and somtimes it does'nt. I have noticed if you pull the battery out and let it dangle it works all the time. This leads me to say that the antenna is part of the 9 volt power supply. So I attached two wires to the power supply of the 9 volt battery. It works better but not as I expected..
3,Convient but with problems,"It is easy to install and use, and very convenient. BUT, if the switch is flicked too quickly, the light won't turn on or off. The biggest the problem is when using CFLs (which are the only thing we use, except now in this room). The lights continue to flicker when the switch (Zenith) is turned off as if the lights don't know whether it is on or off.I would not buy again unless I had to."
4,Lighting problem solver,Installed real easy works reliably at 20 feet distance solved a lighting problem in a finished kitchen and not wanting to make holes and pull wires.
3,Switch,"Works ok. You have to operate the switch up and down to get it to work. Sometimes up is on, sometimes down is on. Overall it solved my switch problem."
4,Heath Zenith BL-6133-LA review,"I have purchased tho pairs of Heath Zenith BL-6133-LA, wireless switch and wall switches. I am happy with this purchase. I found that holding the wall switch tight in your hands may prevent the RF control signal from turning the associated light(s) on/off. If you order multiple pairs of wireless switch and wall switches, make sure you specify that you want them to operate on the same channel or a different channel. The two pairs that I ordered were on the same channel and this is just what I wanted !"
3,Part of it was right ...,"I ordered the product from a model number on the back of the wall switch. I received that product, plus another that I could not use. We intend to implement the product elsewhere, but not for where it was intended. Product itself was new and in its' original container, customer service was great, shipping was prompt. I was just expecting another product, based on the model number requested. That was the only disappointment."
4,nice but could be a little better,"this was easy to install and worked from the start. As a suggestion, it would be nice if there was an optional switch cover for the switch that you are making obsolete to keep someone from putting it in the wrong position."
5,works as advertised,Heath Zenith BL-6133-LA wireless switch was easy to install and worked as advertised. I put the main switch in the front of the garage to turn on the outside light. I installed the wireless switch at the other end of the garage near the door to the living space. I can now turn on/off the switch at either location. No wires need between switches really simplified the installation. I highly recommend this switch for similar applications.
3,International Heavy Trucks of the 1960s,Slightly disappointed that it was only photos. Would have preferred some written background information on the vehicle build components.
4,another in a great series,This is a great series of videos for learning the Five Animal Frolics style of qigong. The videos are well done and easy to learn from. See my reviews of the Bliss and Power Qigong for more details.
5,A Film That Sears Itself to Your Heart,"The voiceover narration that opens ""The Search"" is totally superfluous. All you have to do is look at the eyes and gaunt frames of the youngest victims of the Nazi atrocities and you get the whole story. Few films have moved me so emotionally as ""The Search"" has. ""Schindler's List"" and the opening moments of ""Saving Private Ryan"" come to mind. Director Fred Zinnemann shot this film in documentary style and that intensifies the visceral impact of this masterwork. Montgomery Clift is fine as a G.I. who befriends a young war orphan but the real focus here is young Ivan Jandl. Jandl is quite natural as Karel Malik and one would believe that he was a survivor of the Holocaust. This film defies the star rating because it is compulsory viewing. It's a near tragedy that it's only available over the internet at an inflated price."
4,Early Monty Film,"Buy this through the Warners Archives Collection website!! $19.95 plus tax and shipping. It's still cheaper than these prices!This film was released before Red River, but actually filmed after that. It is the public's first view of Monty on film. A bit dated, but solid performances and direction. I wish they didn't wait 25 minutes before getting Monty on screen, however."
4,The bond between mother & child truly captured,"While this film is dated now, in black & white with quite loud & slapped-on background music, the essence of the story of a mother separated from her small child during the 2nd world war, then the journey that their search for each other takes them through, is absolutely captivating. The performances of the actors are quite stilted excpet for the small boy who is natural & believable. His is simply brilliant. Definitely a film I could watch more than once."
1,Review,"When I purchased this I was not told that this DVD can only be played on ""play only' device. As I have a combine Player/Recorder I cannot give a good rating."
3,CD is good --- but needs to be LONGER !!!!,"Bought CD, is OK, but just when you are really starting to get into the groove of each song...poof! It's over. CD definitely needs more play time. I feel short-changed."
3,Title Song Was Classic,"Even though I consider the album a bit standard, the title song (as well as ""Give Me The Night"") still rank as two of my favorite dance songs of the 1980s.Getting this CD will add to your collection, but don't spend over twenty dollars."
3,Lost in (cyber)space?,"I was introduced to this book because my enlightened sociology prof used it as a text for our discussions of sociology and cyberspace.Some intellectually stimulating articles, like Jodi O'Brien's discussion of gender. It was very stimulating . . . However, the book was far too focused on issues relating to North America and the West generally. What about the rest of the world?Some sections were extremely dull. This is exciting stuff, why must people pervert it into intellectual cheeseburgers?"
4,"Standard air combat stories, but well chosen.","This is a collection of 26 in-the-cockpit memoirs of air warfare: three from World War I, seven Vietnam and the rest (inevitably) WWII. All are taken from best selling biographies. Experienced readers will find nothing new, but it is always fun to go through these well-chosen yarns again, and the book will be a treasure for newcomers. Best of all, it stimulates the reader to track down the original books and points the way to lots of reading fun."
4,Char-Broil,"I find it to be a very good grill. Assembly takes less than an hour. The only headache I encountered was trying to reuse the plastic tabs if you need to re-insert them. The small tin holder on the bottom used for catching grease would fill-up quickly and splash grease around the gas tank, so I added an empty coffee tin and cured the messy clean up. The food warmer rack did not come with retaining caps to hold it in place, so it does un-hinge on one side sometimes. I have had my grill for about five years now and I haven't done any real maintenance besides cleaning it."
4,Boys Will Be Boys,"A classic buddy movie. Neighborhood friends hang together doing things that adolescent males did in the day - drink a little wine, try to get with girls, cut class, goof around, go to house parties, fist-fights. With all the high-jinks during the movie, it ends with tragedy, which spawned the everlasting hit song ""It's So Hard To Say Goodbye To Yesterday"" which was reprised by Boyz II Men."
5,Cooley High still Cool,"I watched this movie as a kid and didn't really understand it. Now as an adult, I watched this movie and fully understand why this movie was so cool to my mother's generation. This movie showed how life was for African-American teenagers, growing up in this era. Most kids didn't really have dreams while a very few of them did. This movie taught me not to listen to my peers and to follow my dreams to wherever they lead me."
3,So-so...,"The glow in the dark part only lasted a few minutes before it faded. So the novelty ""wore"" off quickly -- but it performs its primary function well..."
4,Glow In The Dark XD,"So i have yet to actually use these, but the packaging is really cool, and from what i can see, they really do glow in the dark.. I gave one to a friend as a gag, and he thought they were cool looking too."
4,night light,"It was fun to use. They didn't take long to ""charge"" up to glow. Super bright and the glow lasted a long time."
4,they glow in the dark!,They glow pretty bright. If you look hard enough you might see yourself in your girl.erthe erthr jur qwergt tiuk wtrhy w rtujetrh rukjrty eytj
3,"Condoms were not in a ""pack""","The condoms were not in a pack as indicated in the product description, just loose condoms in a bubble envelope. Maybe they were the extras from a used box that a previous customer had returned, I dunno. This might be a consideration if you're giving them as a gift (or gag gift), as the recipient might wonder if you kept the rest of the box for yourself. I'll update the rating once I've tried them."
2,Too small,"They do glow in the dark if you put them under a light for 30 or so seconds, however when using them they were too small and they felt really weird. I switched out for a Trojan Magnum. Please make these in a bigger size."
2,Extremely redundant but it's honest,"I have to say getting through this book was really kind of torturous. Basically, it's 100 things if that. The portion on ACT II is interesting if onlybecause so this is by far the most difficult part of a script. The author knows this and attacks all of the problems. But even then, it could have been written in three pages instead of 150 annoying little items. A thoroughly obnoxious format. Everything here is more or less in Lew Hunter's book anyway. The only unique thing is her perspective as a reader, but as others pointed out, why the hell do you want to write for a reader anyway? I'd say SKIP IT."
5,A Great Book From A Screenwriting Teacher Who Cares!,"I agree with Ervin Nieves' previous post about Jennifer Lerch, author of 500 Ways to Beat the Hollywood Script Reader: she's a screenwriting teacher who cares and doesn't stop teaching even after you've finished reading her book. Ms. Lerch supplies her readers with her email address and openly canvasses readers for feedback. On a couple of occasions, I emailed her and was delighted to receive prompt and extensive advice, often refocusing my attention on sections of her book I had glossed over, but contained the answer to my questions. Most aspiring screenwriters read dozens of books to learn our craft. Ms. Lerch's 500 WAYS PAST THE HOLLYWOOD SCRIPT READER is one of the indispensable reads. I loved her examples on creating exciting characters and story within a traditional Hollywood three act paradigm, since the paradigm is one of Hollywood's most successful approach to structuring a film that capture's one's attention from the get-go."
5,Valuable Supplement,"Look. There are a great deal of books on the subject of screenwriting. Some are good. Many are simply recirculating the same song and dance. Jennifer Lerch provides a nice peek into the brain of the professional reader. What are they looking for? What turns them on? Off? Here are very easy to follow guides for structure, action descriptions, dialogue, and adding spice to your story. It's not the be-all of screenwriting. It doesn't try to be. It simply serves as a guideline to bounce other advice and tactics against. Applying the advice Lerch gives has helped my screenplays to flow better, read easier, and avoid the pit of dullsville that 99% of all screenplays fall into. Greatly due to Lerch's advice, I now have a script in production for an independant film company. Read it. Good luck fellow writers."
5,Cuts to the chase!,"I have bought this book 12 times as a gift for various friends who aspire to be screenwriters. This book is deceptively easy to read and at first glance, it's easy to dismiss the content as ""phoned in"". Once you begin reading the 500 suggestions, you begin to see the structure and form of ""Drama"" come through. I keep referring to this book over and over as I write because One writes to be read. What Jennifer Lerch accomplishes is the gentle reminder that screenplays are literary experiences before they are visual experiences. That in order to get produced, the screenplay must sell the story and create a reasonable expectation in the reader's mind of what the audience will experience once the film is made. I've read all the other screenplay books and taken the seminars and all that and this book is the one I keep around because it reveals more information the more times you read it and take it's lessons to heart."
5,Quick. Interesting. Informative,I enjoyed this book. I am not much of a reader (of literature and stuff) but I have read quite a few screenplay books. This seems to have all the right info (i.e. brevity and purposeful details only). But I felt I learned a few new things too. I agree that this isn't the only book to read. Writing the Picture is the closet I have come to finding that. But this is an important one for new screenwriters to read.
5,Essential Information Made Simple,"As a story editor for a major production company in Hollywood, I would recommend this book highly to budding screenwriters. Ms. Lerch has encapsulated over ten years of experience into under 200 easy-to-understand pages, that impart VERY PRACTICAL advice on getting a reader's recommendation. After reading ""500 Ways"" you will know to avoid the common mistakes that prejudice a reader before page 10. More advanced writers will still find it a helpful reminder on how to keep each page fresh and engaging. I have not seen any other book that so focusses it's attention on how your script will be read - and judged - at this first critical step on it's ambitious pilgrimage toward the screen."
5,Oh. My. God. THIS BOOK IS A MUST!,"I have written several screenplays that I now realize are TOTAL AMATEUR JUNK, thanks to this book. I am, in fact, embarrassed that I have sent copies of my work to professionals without knowing the basic tips that Jennifer Lerch includes in her new Bible for Screenwriters -- 500 WAYS TO BEAT THE HOLLYWOOD READER. Now, I know we've all wanted to beat a Hollywood reader before -- like, WITH A STICK! But now we should get down on our hands and knees and worship at this woman's feet, her book is THAT GOOD. From tip one to five hundred, I read this how-to in ONE SITTING! I now flip through as I'm rewriting my script -- I'm not even halfway through my new draft, and I'm floored at how much better my writing already is. I'm realistic, and my script may not sell, but THIS BOOK SHOULD -- to every wannabe out there. You won't be a wannabe for long. Hey, from some of the movies I've seen of late, you pros should pick up a copy too!"
2,The online reviews are more interesting than the book,"I expect that I am not alone in being highly amused by the inventiveness of some of the online reviewers for this book, whose acidic sense of humour and satire seems lost on the more sedate minds of others. Might I suggest that 'Sue D'eauymme, 'Steven Spielberg' et al seem to have the making of great comedy screenwriters? It would be interesting if any of their scripts ever came across Jennifer Lerch's desk!The book, incidentally, is a rather average concoction which borrows heavily from other volumes and seems to revel in stating the obvious. There seems little point in reading it unless you are completely in the dark about screenwriting."
2,"If you've read one, you've read them all","This book simple restates the same message stated in so many others. If you have read The Screenwriter's Bible, then you have all the information found in this book. It contains the same do's and don't's that so many other books have. Get the screenwriter's bible. get William Martell's The Secrets of Action Screenwriting. don't get this book."
1,Fake Book reviews,"I have a feeling that many of the reviews posted for this book are, in fact, fake. Call it a hunch, but the 'anonymous' reviews all have the hard-sell feel of a tele-marketing commercial, and somehow don't ring true. There seems to be a lot of this sort of thing going on on the Net these days, and it's very, very, sad."
3,Has some good info,"This is an extremely thin book (175 pages) and most of it is the same old stuff we've heard: 61-63 Make your Characters Distinct. Yea, right.But other parts are very useful, 222: The opening sequence ... runs between 10-15 pages and contains between 3-5 scenes.Others I'm still pondering, 8: Get a Los Angeles phone number."
1,COMMON PLACES,"Beign honest, I cannot understand this flow of enthusiasm and starts about this book. It's just a bunch of common places and some cut+paste stuff. Is not clear and sharp but pretentious. Authors like Seger or Vogler take the effort of explaining the why's and how's of their proposals. The only ""background"" that Learch shows is an snob I-live-in-LA-and-got-some-friends-from-the-showbizz...At least, it's thinier and cheaper than other books of the same cathegory."
1,500 ways to take your money,"this book is total garbage. It has no examples to illuminate the points. It is composed of paragraphs, short snipplets of vague generalizations. The author was apparently in such a hurry to make money that she never bothered to unify her ideas into real chapters. In the final analysis, this is more of a book outline rather than a thought out book. Wait for a new edition that actually is written as a book should be."
4,A very good single,"The CD single consists of 4 songs and the ""Six Days"" video. Three of the songs are ""Six Days"" remixes: a radio edit, a full length album version instrumental, and a remix featuring new vocals and music. The latter of the three consists of the woman's voice from the song, with the music from The Private Press' ""Walkie Talkie"", and added lyrics from rapper Mos Def (I believe). Neither of these three remixes are groundbreaking, but the instrumental is very nice. ""100 Metre"" is a very cool song that is worth the price of the single. It has a dark tone (like a lot of DJ Shadow's work) that fits in well with the Private Press era music. If you are a fan of the new album, I would check this out. Its a nice single to have."
2,Our kids can't make it work,"WThis thing looks like a great idea, and we bought three of them, but the kids have never been able to get their skateboards into the hanger. Even my husband and I struggle with it. However, they work perfectly for a ripstick, and they also do a nice job of keeping tennis raquets organized."
4,an exciting match,"This is one of the most exciting and unbelievable wimbledon final. A thrilling fifth set !!!This match is best remembered because Ivanisevic was the only person to win the men's singles title at Wimbledon as a wildcard, having previously been runner-up at the championships in 1992, 1994 and 1998."
5,Rafter Vs. Ivanisevic on DVD...what a match,"Could not get enough of this tennis match. To watch the Wimbledon 2001 final with Patrick Rafter and Goran Ivanisevic going at it again was a joy. This match was a nail-biter as the championship could have went either way. In fact it lasted for 5 sets, and the stadium fans were very much into it till the very end. Although you can already 'predict' the outcome (the cover shows Ivanisevic kissing the trophy), you the viewer can't help but get involved in the match. The enthusiasm of the stadium fans is contagious; these are the rowdiest Wimbledon fans you'll every see, which added to the excitement of the moment. Rafter and Ivanisevic were two of best tennis players of my generation, and to be able to watch this historic match again was just awesome."
5,One of the better versions of Petrarch's sonnnets,"This is a magnificent version of Petrarch's works, capturing the essence and meaning of the original works. It is hard to find good translations to poetry, and this book is definitely one of the better I've read regarding to Petrarch."
5,Top notch science fiction for thinkers,"This is not romance-in-space, but really stretches the reader with imaginative and complex concepts and excellent writing. It's not the easiest book to read, but very rewarding."
5,Prepare your youth,"This is a great resource for preparing your youth as they leave high school and enter the college years. I am going to have my youth leader teach this book every year, March - May, in order to cement these truths in the minds and hearts of our youth.Tim Brown, PastorCalvary Chapel Fremont"
3,Reason for purchasing,"I did not purchase this item for the shows themselves, although I can really remember laughing a lot when his programs were on the air. I was browsing throuth YouTube several weeks ago and came across his performance when he did the Pledge of Allegiance and that is what I needed. I aleady have the printed copy of that performance, but needed the video (DVD) to show others. My plan was to read the printed copy myself, but of course, Red's actual performance of it is to stirring! A perfect fit for Veterans' Day next month."
4,A Young Band with Quirky Tunes,"Though this quartet calls New York home, Moth, on Provisions, Fiction and Gear, could easily have come from the Alternative Pacific Northwest. Vocalist Brad Stenz is a ringer for Modest Mouse's Isaac Brock, and Moth's music is like bite-sized nuggets of MM's sprawling tales of alienation. They've got hooks to burn, and burn they do on most of these 12 cuts. They keep the tempos moving, and overlay a few tracks with glossy new wave touches (the vocal on ""Lovers Quarrel"" is a histrionic homage to the New Romantics). They're shooting for the alt-mainstream, but are eccentric enough to miss by a few yards. In the end, their quirkiness saves them from being just another young band with catchy tunes."
1,Poop,"Glossy, overproduced and phony. I hate Los Angeles studio created rock and roll. It should be made a crime."
2,Drone and Slam---Too Much of the Same,"Maybe I'm just annoyed at the missing serial comma in the title ""Provisions, Fiction and Gear"" by Moth, but I'm clearly in the minority of reviewers. The drone and slam approach to music has never done much to excite me, and the notion that one has to adhere to a signature sound instead of trying out something new and different proves stifling. It's as though the band is drawn to produce this one sound much like a moth is drawn to the light.I like some of the tracks here---Cocaine Star, Burning Down My Sanity, and I See Sound---but it's the session as a whole that falters, leaving one in a stupor much like a moth stunned by cedar.One quick question: If this CD really merits all those 4 or 5 star ratings, why is it that used copies are going for less than a nickel?"
4,Excellent orientation on Jesus in the Gospels and Christ for today.,"As a student of the Bible, I have benefited from the presentation Marsh and Moyise offer of the Jesus made known in each of the four New Testament gospels, as well as in lesser known gospels not accepted as part of the Bible. Their simultaneous engagement with contemporary scholarship on Jesus as a prophet, as a ""word-spinner,"" as a political liberator engaged with the poor and with women as well, as a spiritual and ethical guide, and as the Christ of Faith provides a deeper sense of both who Jesus was and how we may understand him today."
4,Saki Set,The quality of the Saki set is excellent. Great Vendor. Shipped promptly.My only critique is that the carafe is a little small for 4 cups supplied with the set.
1,This is not an audio book! It's music from the movie!,"Okay, I should've paid closer attention while placing my order...this is just to try to keep someone else from repeating my mistake. I wanted an audio version of the book, and what I got was music from the movie. NOT what I wanted, although I can hardly complain to the seller at the price I paid ($2 plus shipping for a factory sealed cd). I haven't opened the cd to listen to it, so the music may be perfectly wonderful. If I could've given this a neutral rather than negative connotation with regard to quality or how much I liked it, I would've. Still, I won't have my book in time for my trip. :-("
2,My first experience reading a suspense novel....,"In the beginning as the mystery sets up, I was interested in the plot. There were many characters that were introduced, which made me pay attention to the story. But when Rei goes back home and to her normal life, I didn't understand why she wanted to be involved in solving Setsuko's murderer. I would understand if Rei and Setsuko were acquaintances, but they had no relation to each other at all. I found Rei Shimura very nosy and annoying because at times, she wouldn't speak up for herself, especially when Mamasan and other people she met were very rude to her. Her nosiness gets her into trouble most of the time, which made her look clumsy and childish. The murderer was revealed in an ""all of a sudden"" matter, which created no suspense for me. All in all, my first experience reading a suspense novel is only two stars, but I won't stereotype all suspense novels on this first experience."
4,Wonderful Taste of Japan,"This book is really wonderful. The author and main character are not Japanese so the sense of being on the outside looking in is very appropriate to most readers, making many of the mysteries of Japanese custom clear.It is an elegant, tight story with fascinating characters. I had never been interested in things Japanese but after reading this book I am obsessed with finding more mysteries from the Land of the Rising Sun. Thank you, Sujata Massey!"
1,Waste of time..,"Don't read this, if you are japanese mystery fan. This is not that kind. If you like Nancy Drew, it will work too. But, It was so hard for me to finish this book. Typical western and romance novel. Boring and lame. First of all the writer is not japanese practically. Don't be deceived."
3,Adequate but wandering,"There's much to like about this book. The mystery is adequate, although follows well-known lines where every ordinary event connects to a larger conspiracy, and the characters are personable. However, they're disposable plastic like the world that confines them. Massey writes convincingly of the conflict one might feel caught between the cultures of east and west, as does the half-Japanese half-American protagonist, but there is no hope to these people. A plastic world does something to them, and they react, and are given plastic rewards. I recommend this reading this book to acquire an enduring sense of hopelessness."
3,Just OK light reading...,"I took this book on a week-long backpack and it was great for that purpose. Nothing heavy or particularly downbeat. However there were a few bits and pieces that I found hard to swallow including a too-long glossed over obvious clue and the hate/attraction between Rei and Hugh.Mysteries aren't in my usual reading fare so I can't comment farther on the quality of the mystery itself. I figured it out however.But, you know, it might make a movie. The scenes and setting might just work. The sex component is there as is the beautiful people component. The violence is fairly subdued although Hollywood would probably insist on puffing up the violence level. The usual brainless, follow the leader approach.Anyway, borrow this book and read it for fun. Don't expect great literature."
5,Terrific Mystery that Enlightens as it Chills,This book is a terrific work that combines facts about Japan and women's roles within the Japanese community with a mystery that propells the reader to stay up nights just to read it. If you love cultural enlightenment mixed in with murder this is the book for you. This writer is gifted and all of her books are a great treat for the intellectual mystery reader
4,Mystery keeps you guessing,"I enjoyed this book - it was very well written for a first novel and the mystery kept me guessing.Rei, the main character is earnest, tenacious, hot headed and a bit irritating but for the most part always interesting.The brief glimpses of the culture and locales in Japan didn't overwhelm the story but did add an exotic background for the book.I didn't find the relationship between Rei and Hugh very compelling or believable. It seemed more of a basic sexual attraction than something that will develop into a full fledged relationship. I guess time will tell on that aspect of the story.I've already purchased the next two books in the series and hope they are as well written and interesting as the first."
4,Whodunnit?!,"This was a perfectly complex Christie type murder book with the added twist of being culturally educational. The story is told from the eyes of Rei Shimura, a half-Japanese American ex-pat living in Japan. The description of Japanese culture, from her point of view, is neither bored nor is it wide-eyed wonder. I felt like I was being informed of Japan as it really would be to someone in her position - a girl with one foot as a resident and one as a foreigner.The mystery itself is the standard whodunnit, with some interesting, again cultural, twists and turns. I was not very impressed with the ""love story"" as it were. But it did add another flavor to the pot.All in all, a good Christmas day read!(*)>"
4,"Good mystery, interesting insights on modern Japan","As an exchange student in Yokohama, it's interesting to read a book set in places I'm familiar with. The people, the attitudes, the ""Jinglish"" (or ""waseieigo""- ""Made-in-Japan English"" as it's known in Japanese), the struggle to learn kanji ... I could relate to it all. The mystery was interesting, the plot was believable. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone interested in mysteries with an exotic touch."
4,The Salaryman's Wife,"The Salaryman's Wife is an intriguing book that mixes mystery, adventure and just the right amount of romance. With an intriguing look at Japan through the eyes of Rei, a Japanese American gen xer, who teaches english in Tokyo. When she decides to go to the country on vacation over the New Year stumbles accross a murder, it changes her entire life. Following Rei while she uncovers the murderer is truely deligtful. I can not wait to read her other books now."
1,She shouldn't Get a Salary for this one,"Characters that are shallow, uninteresting,Story that is less than compellingPoor writing.Sorry, but this book does not have much to offer in the way of a plot or characters. I don't know how some authors do it, but you either love or hate the main characters. You care about what happens. This book had none of that for me. It all seemed shallow, and frankly, I was glad to be done with it. Now, on to a very compelling author; Leon Uris."
3,Pretty Good,"This seems to be a good book for people who are familiar with keeping lizards, but not anoles in particular. Since anoles are my first reptile pet, I found some parts of the book hard to follow and a lot of my questions were unanswered."
5,Its like the discover channel with pages.,This book is verry enlightning I found everything I need to know about the little devils...lol.
4,"Nice, basic book","I though that this was a good, basic book about anoles. It is a good book for general information about these lizards. However, I would have appreciated more detailed information about how to take care of crickets."
3,hard to understand,"the information is a little vague, and there are alot of big words. It makes the book a little hard to understand. If you are about to buy this book i would go with a different title."
5,Great Weight Watchers treat,"I was introduced to these by a friend at a get-together. Unable to find them in my supermarket, I turned to Amazon. At one point plus for 2 pieces, this is a tasty treat well worth the money."
4,"Sheba, Baby","Pam Grier being my favorite actress makes it hard for me to rate this video anything lower than a 4. But, in all sincerity, it's a fun, fast-paced movie of revenge and adventure on the high seas. Pam's sexy presence makes it hard to divert your attention from the video, even if it's to pause the tape to take a bathroom break! Pam Grier in one of her more tame roles is sure to please."
3,SELLOUT OR BE KILLED,"This was Pam Grier's final blaxploitation film. By now she had stopped doing nude scenes. Pam returns home to find her dad being muscled out of business by some thugs. She springs into action against them. What I like about this film is that it captured the era so well. The large automobiles, the colorful clothes with wide lapels, and the prices for fast food burgers. Pam apparently does her own stunts. The scenes of her running and shooting a gun are comical by today's standards. Pam ""runs like a girl"" which is unlike tough women in the films today. She also runs around trains, cars, and buildings instead of jumping on roof tops.As a regular film, it is somewhat of a let down, especially compared to Pam's other works such as Coffy, The Big Bird Cage Women in Cages, The Big Doll House, and Scream Blacula Scream.No f-bombs, not much in the sex and nudity department."
3,Pam Grier one of my Favorite Actresses-Not One of the Best Movies.Sheba Baby.,"I think Sheba Baby is a Good albeit not excellent movie, Coffy Is the best of this era, followed by black mama,white mama, then friday foster. Sheba, Baby is still a Pam Flick worth watching."
3,Pam Grier on River? Standard Blaxploitation Action Film,"The film is essentially suffers from a too ordinary story and set-pieces such as car bomb and shoot-out, but ""Sheba Baby"" will surely entertain Pam Grier fans.Sheba Shayne, a PI in Chicago, has to fly back to her hometown after hearing that her father was threatened by the local mob. Naturally, before she knows it, Sheba is involved in a fight against the cruel syndicate. The rest is almost the same as her movies prior to ""Sheba,"" only difference being some twists in a rather trite story. The most attractive part is the last chase scene on a river, and there Pam herself operates a motor boat. It is enjoyable, but has no cutting-edge of ""Coffy."" At least ""Sheba Baby"" is not awfully banal or impossible like ""Drum,"" in which Pam is to appear the following year. ""Sheba""s soundtrack by Barbara Mason. Strictly for fans of genre."
2,Don't Let the pic fool ya,Man I love any blaxplotation but this movie [is bad]. No action no T&A the plot is asinine the sets look like the movie was shot on someones back yard. Good for a rainy Saturday when you don't care if you fall asleep before the movie ends.
2,"Sheba, Baby","Let me start by saying I'm a big Pam Grier fan but this movie was one of her worse efforts. I don't know if it was just the particular disc I have but the sound was awful. I had to turn up the sound to a rediculous volume level just to barely hear it. Typical of ""Blaxplotation"" films the plot was weak, the violence gratuitous and the villians one dimentional. Our heroine looked good as usual but if you're looking for skin this isn't your film."
1,Also Bad TandA,"If you're looking for sexy scenes, and why else would you watch these movies, don't waste your time."
4,I bought this cd for one song only...,"After watching Betty Hutton being interviewed on TCM I was haunted by the song they played at the end - I Wish I Didn't Love You So. Up till then I'd only known (and loved) Betty for her zany numbers. This album is probably not the best out there (Somebody Loves Me seems to have better sound quality and more of her beautiful ballads), but there are some fun songs on this one. I Wish I Didn't Love You So really is hauntingly beautiful. The Satin and Spurs songs from the TV special are basically forgettable."
3,Slump continued,"People who gave this 5 stars must not be familiar with Mindy's much better former albums. This album is O.K., but only O.K. Mindy's first two were awesome, the third solid. This album, her fourth, is definitely her weakest. The bottom line is that the songs are just plain forgettable. None of them, except the respectable, Lips Like Yours, stick in my head. A bunch of songs from Mindy's other albums stick in my head. There are a few covers here: Maybe, Maybe Not was done better by Mila Mason, and Fire was done better by Chely Wright. Mindy kinda lost her way on this one, then had a bunch of personal problems. That's a bummer, cuz she is a good singer, one of my favorite, just not on this album."
3,"""Mindy McCready""","This was her weakest country album. It has numerous songs which might have been successful if marketed to the lite rock sect. Her music is soft and sensual which tends to get lost in Country music unless its very sad, upbeat, or sung by a man. Sexier songs are not as appreciated sung by women as they are in lite rock. Its very sad. ""Be with me,"" ""The Fire,"" ""I just want love,"" and ""Don't speak"" are sexy and great songs to dance with that special someone. They were undermarketed. Mindy is great. Share this with the one you love on a quiet night."
3,Mindy's SELF TITLED NEW ALBUM MISSES SOME BEATS!,"After such wonderful songs such as GUY'S DO IT ALL THE TIME, WHAT IF I DO, OTHER SIDE OF THIS KISS, and others, Mindy can definitely pick the right material. Her first album on CAPITOL RECORDS is very hit and miss. The opening track, MAYBE, MAYBE NOT is a winner as is SCREAM and THE FIRE (also recorded by Chely Wright) but the other 8 tracks are just simply middle of the road.....I am hoping Mindy goes back to her roots on her next album and does another winner! This fan knows she can do it and hope she does!"
5,VERY GOOD CAMERA!!,I have this camera one year ago and it is working very well.. Excelent photo quality.
2,This was a disappointing trip through the table of organization,"This book is mis-titled since it deals primary with by what designation the various units were known. It deals very little with the actual battles that took place in those days. If you want technical data, this is the one. If you want info on the battle, save your money."
5,USMC PTO 1941-43,Another great piece of history by Osprey: succint and informative. Nice addition to the Pacific Campaign of WWII.
2,10.50?,"i used to work in a food service establishment that'd sell candy at the counter. anyways, we had this tub and quite frankly these fruit slices are disappointing. oranges taste good- they're tangy sweet, and orangy. well, this candy just has that perfumey orange essence as if you licked the orange and sweetness, nothing else much."
4,"Buckley's ""Mongoose, RIP"" entertainingly provocative","As someone with little knowledge of the Kennedy years in the white house, given what we now know of the geo-political climate of the time, this book reads like a genuine, behind-the-scenes look into the Kennedy / Castro conflict. With ingenious characters and subplots, Mr Buckley provides the reader with an immensely entertaining, can't put the book down thriller. Blackford Oakes is a much more believable secret agent than that we are served up in any James Bond movie, more along the lines of a Jack Ryan, tenacious in persuing the aim of his mission. The flow of the story is exquisitely smooth and the surprise plot twists are most intriguing. Could these things have actually happened? Seems credible in hindsight...and a great read!"
2,The hero scarcely appears,"Chapter after chapter is devoted to Nikita Khrushchev's point of view, or Fidel Castro's, who are as cardboard as you might expect; thus any emotional ""through-line"" is lost. Blackford Oakes, the hero, shows up so infrequently -- I'd guess we see him in no more than one out of every six chapters. Which makes for a tedious read. Sorry."
4,"Pretty much the ""Best Of The Blue Note Years"" except for 3 songs.","As the title states if you already own ""Best Of The Blue Note Years"" you have this disc. Sound quality is the same. I was fortunate to have checked out this disc from the library rather than buy it: I already own the Best Of The Blue Note Years. Songs that aren't on the Best of Blue Note is: ""All The Things You Are"", ""Let's Cool One"" and ''Nice Work If You Can get It''."
4,Good place to start if you want ambient electronic music,"I'm not really of fan of ambient music. I never really have been to be honest. But Tangerine Dream's Pheadra (and similar works by TD and ex-member Klaus Schulze's solo material) is an exception. The music is dreamy and slow moving, yet over time creates a very tense mood. It's wonderful late night music and drifting off to sleep listening to it is a great musical experience. The music pulsates and shifts from form to form like a hazy dream. I don't really have much to say about it except that if you're looking to experience ambient, minimalistic electronic music, this is the perfect place to find it."
2,A long winded borefest,"A lot of people love this album and I understand why. Tangerine Dream as a band mastered the art of atmosphere and subtlety and were pioneers of electronic music. But, to somebody who enjoys melodic, soulful music, listening to Phaedra is about as fun as reading a Dickens novel. Too much air, not enough substance.The above statement may be unfair of me. Tangerine Dream wasn't set on making ""fun"" music. ""Interesting"" is a much better term. But it's not even interesting unless the sound of the wind perplexes you."
2,Overhyped,"Vangelis was much better at creating atmosphere than this. And, he had better composition skills. I can't recommend this but there are some interesting sounds and they probably started the ambient craze. I just think this music lacks focus."
4,Perfect for meditation,I have used this CD for more than a year as a background for meditation and prayer. The second cut is particularly effective.
3,Better Choices,"ACIM had a number of helpful nuggets. They were helpful as much as you would expect from a Columbia University psychologist. They were not Jesus channeling helpful. The ego in this book is overdone, too much repetition, and requires a heavy time commitment. There are a number of books that have more useful information and also include mind reorganization techniques. I highly recommend the Seth books by Jane Roberts beginning with ""The Nature of Personal Reality.""Peace, happiness, and harmony in your life journey."
5,"An incredible revelation, constantly amazing, unending source of insights","No need to provide an exhaustive diary of my quest for the truth that spans experimentation with drugs, firewalks and Buddhism, I'm sure your list is as long or longer. Suffice to say, I stayed with each diversion long enough to discover that they left me empty, and thirsting for ""real answers and truth"". After reading the first 3 pages of this masterpiece, I set it down and knew with every cell of my body that this book was a ladder to the truth. This is the most amazing book you will ever experience."
5,"Miracles, of Course","I loved the fact that the text, the workbook for students and the manual for teachers were combined into one book.This is heavy reading and I would not have made it thru the text without the help of the workbook and manual -- particularly the workbook."
5,A course in miracles,"The way life (as we know it), the bible, and religion have been described to me in the past never really made sense to me. no matter what, i would always tell myself, ""there has to be a better way."" well there is! this book explains that the happiness we seek throughout life, the unanswered questions, peace, euphoria, virtue, compassion, love and GOD are within you and all creation. i recommend the book to everyone so they can realize what truth really is and means. when you are ready to stop looking for for whatever it is you are looking for, when you are ready, this book will help you find it."
5,Meditation Guide,"This book is an excellent meditation guide for an entire year. It is a good place to start in your effort learn about meditation.G Biagasee, Author of ""Live Your Own Life, Die Your Own Death"""
5,Make take years to fully appreciate,"A Course in Miracles: Combined VolumeThis is my third attempt to enjoy this book, this time, I really do. So many layers, so high is the meaning density! The workbook for students is a powerful spiritual technique multiplied by profoundly professional didacticism. This book now fully agrees with me as a person"
4,great for mental course correction,"Amazing musings and great to pick up and read in small doses to keep your thoughts on a healthy trajectory. Also powerful for longer sittings when your commitment is to transform your relationship to the world,"
4,Be Warned--Small Print!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I've been doing ACIM since 1994 and am used to the Foundation For Inner Peace's original printings of the course. This version, although it packs in all of the extra writings (which I'm happy about, hence the 4 stars) also tries to pack everything into a smaller sized book and has used a smaller font size to do it. Had I known this, I wouldn't have ordered it, as the previous font size was perfect, this font size actually makes me squint, especially early in the morning when I""m trying to read it and meditate. If you need a slightly more travel sized version (bigger than a paperback, but smaller than the ""regular"" version), it IS compact, but just be warned that the font size is smaller and you'll either need to put on some glasses or be willing to turn the lights on really brightly and squint, if your vision isn't already spectacular."
5,Great service,"Thank you for sending me my order so quickly, the process of ordering went smoothly, l have ordered off you a few times now and there is no fear that my books are not goingto arrive on time and in good or perfect order depending on whether it is second hand or new !!"
5,Absolutely Fantastic,"The book came in just a few days, and shipping was free. It is a brand new book still in the original shrink-wrap, and cost approximately one half the bookstore price. The book itself is absolutely marvelous and I am loving every minute I spend reading it. I would recommend Amazon as well as this book to anyone."
3,amazing content which is somewhat tough to read,"There is a wealth of spiritual thoughts in this groundbreaking book. I found it enlightening and I had to stay focused and read some of the sections again for it to sink into my consciousness. And when it did, wow!This course has been taught and still is being taught all around the world and this is what started it all!"
2,All over the place,This was one of the hardest books I have ever tried to read. She is all over the place during her explanations. Edited properly this book would be about a third as long.
2,Not a book you sit down and read. More a COURSE,"This is something you study over a long period of time, about a year. There are many groups across the country that meet to work through the book. I recommend participating in one. I find I don't agree with the material in the book, but it is logical. You need to read it and form your own opinion."
1,Defining the truth...,"This book uses the name of God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit but it totally misinterprets and changes what the Bible is actually saying. If anyone were to actually read the Bible for themselves they could find the discrepancies between what the author is saying and what the Bible actually means. If you want to write a bunch of stuff about the value of man, changing your thinking and making your life count, fine, but don't assign God's name to it."
1,Do not read.,"After reading this book for nearly two decades, I finally stopped when I got really sick. Months of illness lead me to read the Bible, and what happened afterward I would not have believed if it had not happened to me. I cannot really explain the anxiety, fear and darkness, but suffice to say here that before you undergo any massive spiritual study, make sure you read everything out there. Once it is in you, it is difficult to get out. Have a look at the book The Light That Was Dark and The Beautiful Side of Evil."
1,BE WARNED!,"The ""jesus"" that wrote this book is not the true Jesus of the Bible. Jesus of the Bible Himself warned about ""jesus"" like this coming to deceive people. Please read Matthew 24 in the Bible. For a better understanding/exposure of what is going on, please read the book ""Reinventing Jesus Christ"" by Warren B Smith, of the Lighthouse Trail Publishing. It's available free on his web site. You can do a google search for it. I cover myself and all that are working to expose such deceptions as these, with the precious blood of the one and the only true Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God. May we never be deceived in Jesus name. Amen."
1,The gospel according to Oprah,"This book is garbage, a total waste of time and money. There is nothing here of any real substance. It is just more of the current crop of "" new age"" baloney being touted by celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey.I am an avid book lover and collector, but this one went in the trash can, which is where it belongs."
2,Caused problems on my Kindle,"I can't tell you much about the content of the book, because this Kindle edition was so electronically problematic that I had to delete it from my Kindle. It caused serious problems on my Kindle. Every time I opened or tried to navigate the book, it locked up the Kindle. I could not turn pages, I could not escape to the home page, at times I could not even turn off the Kindle. On several occasions the Kindle actually ""rebooted"" itself while I had this book opened. Twice I had to completely start over by resetting the Kindle, and then my well-organized folders turned up all shuffled and out of order. My navigation preferences were randomly overridden. Finally I just gave up and deleted the book from the device. Since that decisive moment the Kindle has been working just fine!"
2,I don't like this at all,"A lot of things about this book say 'CULT' to me. You have its adherents going, ""the course"", the book takes this authoritative tone - based on what? Let's not be misguided, this person speaks for herself. Even if some spirit told her this, it doesn't make sense to rely so much on it and I feel very aprehensive when she chooses to hijack the name of Jesus for this book's authorship. If this isn't the historical Jesus but a spirit that conveys the truth of Jesus or whatever that means ... why try to rope in people with the name; she knows she can sway people that way. First page says free will doesn't allow you to set the curriculum. Excuse me? What do you think you're doing? She gives her religion a formal title of 'ACIM' with a logo/""spiritual symbol"" of it's own. A lot of teachings might be found in other forms, Buddhism and so on. I'll take my info from there, not from some creepy person who sounds every bit like a sham cult leader."
2,A Course in Miracles,"Very philosophical and unpolished. Philosophy has an evaluative structure that makes reading philosopohy easier. However, it is not employed in this writing. Additonally there are over 900 pages - why? This is definitely not a weekend trip through literary genius."
5,A COURSE IN MIRACLES,Listen...and see if you remember an ancient song you knew so long ago and held more dear than any melody you taught yourself to cherish since.A must read if you awaken one not so fair morning suddenly lost struggling to find a helpful signpost. A wondrous strange blue book with an even stranger title.Doug L ............. Wash DC
5,A Clear Vision,"Best book ever for understanding who we are and who we can be. Not for the faint of heart, for it challenges everything we hold true in this world."
3,I am not perfect - or is it the book?,"My honest impression, after trying really hard, that this book is a genial psycho-technical contrivance. However, IMHO it violates the Occam's razor ""other things being equal, a simpler explanation is better than a more complex one"". A reconciliation of Christianity with Buddhism? OK with me, but Bahá'u'lláh already taught the world at an incomparably greater extent in 1850-60s that the Truth has been revealed through Abraham, Krishna, Zoroaster, Moses, Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad. The best part of the bookA Course in Miracles: Combined Volumeis definitely the Manual - but why it is necessary to make Jesus fortify a self-help technique borrowed from Buddha if it'd work all by itself? Or would it?"
5,modern day bible,"This book reminds me so much of a bible. The paper is fine, the paragraphs, or thoughts, are numbered and then each sentence is sub numbered. It is very deep and yet simple all at once. This book has been presented to me a few times over the last 3 years and I was always intimidated by it. But in all my books I have read about spirituality and the law of attraction, this book is quoted more often then any other. I figured that if this is the book that all the teachers go by then I should just go to the source. Now I see why! It is magnificent in it's writing and teachings. It has a student handbook part that is very easy to read and follow. It is the type of book that you could open any page and it would probably be relevant to whatever was happening that day. It has a magical all knowing energy about it. Certainly one for the library of one on a spiritual path."
1,Hard read!,"Maybe my IQ is just a bit lower than others, but I found this book a bit difficult to read.The preface/intro for the book did not really provide much of a intro on how to study the book. And I'm not sure how the text combines with the student lessons.Also, I think the book delved too soon into the ""deep"" stuff without much background."
4,"Well written, no ""fluff"" informative subject.","Very intense book, not meant to be read quickly. This book has been referenced by many other books I have read and I therefore felt it is required reading for personal growth."
1,Incomprehensible drivel,"This book is difficult to understand, page after page. After reading about a quarter of the book I gave up because I could not describe to myself what the author(s) had written up to that point. It was pure gibberish. I consider myself pretty well-read, but I felt like an idiot after reading 25% of ACIM.If you like extracting and extrapolating great meaning from incomprehensible riddles and then changing your life based on that, you might want to give this book/course a try. But I think spirituality and self-help needs to be clear and easy to understand so everybody can generally agree on what is being taught. ACIM is a failure in this regard, as are many highly regarded spiritual books including the Bible and the Koran. Incomprehensibility and contradictions breed conflict.I recommend Eckhart Tolle, Jon Kabat-Zinn, Stephen Batchelor, Thich Naht Hanh and Ken McLeod instead; they are consistent and clear in their messages."
3,"This review is on the BOOK, not the content","I love the content of the Course in Miracles, and it is so convenient to have all of the resources in one spot.BUT to fit all of that content into one book, the pages are VERY thin. I have a hard time turning them (often have to lick my finger). And forget about highlighting your favorite passages - it'll bleed right through."
4,really learning about myself,"I like that it's broken down into bite size pieces, teaching you about forgivenes and expansion. Now I'm more aware that if I have a negative thought, throught the spirit I endeavor to go to the polar opposite of possitivity..some phrases i don't understand. would prefer better lamens terms of some subject matter. love the fact that it's a 365 day cycle. i started 1 Jan."
5,ACIM,This is the Go-To book for ACIM - it has the text AND the Lessons all in one book! Cover is nice quality and print nice size. i mistakenly ordered the Mass Market edition first and had to return it as print was small for my eyes!
1,course in miracles,ordered this and after two weeks never received it they did send refund promptly but I'd rather have the books.next time I guess
1,Please go read this book,"For all those who like this book, please go read this book and then come back and comment. The title really should be; Everything I learned in Sunday School Was Wrong.Don't Blame God! A Biblical Answer to the Problem of Evil, Sin, and SufferingFor those of you who dislike this book, please read the same book. You will enjoy it immensely. Biblically and scripturally correct."
1,Goes directly against the Word of God.,"I bought this book hoping that I was wrong about it's content. I was not wrong. If you are interested in going against everything that the Bible teaches, this is the book for you. A Course in Miracles is very insiduous in that Ms. Schucman does quote some Bible scripture but obviously puts her own twist on it. The content of this book was dictated to her by a ""spirit"", but it could not be the Holy Spirit that the Bible speaks of because God never contradicts Himself. This book is not for anyone who wishes to follow the path of God. Do not be deceived."
5,Solved the cup holder problem,"Well, this is a perfect car seat for us because my son always falls asleep and his head no longer is at a 90 degree angle when he dozes off. As far as the cup holder problem, yeah most sippies don't fit so we bought that kind from the automotive section of the store that you hang in the car window.. hey, problem solved... minor $4 investment."
3,Good but not great....,"I do love Britax car seats and my son has had the marathon for 2 years now and was ready for a booster. I bought this one and took it back. I thought it was rather cheaply made. the cupholders are absolutely worthless. Yes, this is not a safety feature but still it's important to my son to have his cup nearby and they just fly out of the holder while you're driving b/c they are not deep enough. I also don't like that it didn't have armrests and though I like the idea of side impact protection, this seat snugs their head a little too tightly and my son couldn't tolerate it. he was constantly leaning forward trying to see out the window. anyway, I'm sure like all Britax products, this is a safe seat but just not the right one for us."
5,Great Seat!,"I bought his for my son, mainly because of its design for a side impact collision. We have captains chair in our vehicle, and I was concerned about protection in an accident. The head piece almost wraps around the sides of a child's head (excellent protection), which I also find great when my son naps in the car. His head no longer hangs forwards or leans to the side.As with all Britax products the quality is superior. Yes, this seat is more expensive than most boosters, but it is well worth the money -- nice padding, good head protection, comfortable fit, etc...."
5,Great Booster Seat,"We have been exceptionally happy with this booster seat-it provides great head support for our son when he is sleeping on long car rides, as well as is easy to install. Our son, who is four, can buckle himself with this seat and reports that it is comfortable. We will purchase another one when our daughter is ready to transition to a booster seat. The cup holders are too shallow, but aren't an issue as they fold nicely into the bottom of the seat and are then invisible. We don't use cup holders anyway, so that is a non-issue for us."
5,for safety and comfort and still booster seats the twins love,"Have twin granddaughters... Safety and comfort for them was my greatest concern but needed seats that would fit in the Jeep and still have room for the extras we alway seem to carry. No problem for this booster seat. The girls loved the seats from day one. Easy to install, have great head rests and best of all the seat belts stay in place so girls aren't always trying to adjust them like their old seats. Well worth the extra cost over the boosters I compared it too."
3,Initially I liked it but not thrilled,I purchased this booster for my twins. When you look at it side by side to other seats it is more sturdy and looks more substantial so I purchased it. Unfortunatly when my kids fall asleep they fold forward which scares me to death. I wonder are they truly safe in an accident? In addition recently my children were able to remove the top portion of the seat cover and snap the foam in half.I called the company and they will send me the replacement foam but I'm not sure if I'm satisfied with that. I would think they would stand by their product more? I'll keep you updated on what happens.
5,cupholder solution,"I bought this booster in February and love it. I thought I would share a solution I found for the cupholder that has worked for us from day one. I bought a cheap white plastic cup at Party City for approximately .69 cents with the Disney Princesses on it. They make all characters. The base of the cup snugly fits in the Britax cup holder and the princess cup is large enough that we use it as our modified cupholder. All of my daughter's bottled waters, sippy cups, even fast food cups fit inside. I never remove it except for cleaning and it works great! It did crack a little at the base from the pressure and indentions of the Britax cupholder, so you must remember not to pour liquid directly into it or you will have a leak. I have been using the same cup for five months now with success. Good luck!"
5,Mommy in Charlottesville Va,"Our son was a few months shy of turning 4 and his britax advantage was just too small for him now, even though he wasn't at the 40 lb limit to advance to a booster seat. We searched everywhere and did tons of research on getting him a new seat. I heard that the Britax Express was a good seat and I wanted to stick with Britax since we have only used that namebrand since he was an infant. The seat is great, comfy and it is perfect for naps, as the sidewings act as pillows. The only downside is the cupholders, not britax quality. Overall this seat is stable and it stays put. (not sure what the other people were talking about when they say it moved while they were driving) Worth the money as britax normally is."
1,Don't waste your money,"I don't understand why these got such rave reviews. I agree with EH. They are very poor quality. They are so thin you can literally see through them which kind of negates wearing them as a protective shield against contact allergies (why I bought them in the first place), the wrists are so baggy they fall off your hands unless you clinch them with a band or string, and the seams were already holey before I put them on, which only worsened after a cold water wash on the delicate cycle. I'd return them if I could, but I can't. I just ordered some 100% cotton parade gloves from Premiumuniformal.com I called first to try and get some info so I wouldn't repeat my same experience, but they wouldn't tell me how thick the gloves are. Instead they told me to just buy them and see (not exactly off to a good customer service start......). We'll see. Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised or maybe I'll just be throwing another $20+ away."
3,Not fitted enough,"I purchased this pair of gloves to wear at night while I moisturize my hands. I have small hands, but ordered medium based on the reviews. The fingers fit fine, however, the gloves are very wide and ""open"" at the wrists, causing the gloves to slip off during the night. Just wish they had been a little more fitted around the wrist...maybe a loose elastic? I would try a different type before ordering these again."
2,Max Cot,Don't let the 350lb rating fool you -->the center folding brackets bent (soft steel) over my first weeks use and I only weight 230lbs. Discovered the issue upon trying to fold it back into its carry sack otherwise worked well but I'm going to look for a better cot & manufacturer since Tex Sport won't stand behind their product but Amazon is great for resolving my issue!
3,I thought a set is bigger,It looks very nice but it is very small. It is good gift for someone who is indifferent to you.
5,Recommended,"I loved this book. I've read all Edward O. Phillips' books and can only hope there will be more. It is not a Mystery/Thriller as classified; rather the story of a 60s something bisexual's experiences and life reflections on a Caribbean cruise. Admittedly, I agree with most of his views. Funny, too.Lee"
5,VIVA DURANGO C_ BRONES!! 2ND TO NONE.,This album has no substitution. These are the songs that made this band famous and without a doubt they are second to none. These songs get to your heart and just make you appreciate this band for the music quality they produce. Arriba el Conjunto Primavera
5,Arriba El Mendozseno!!!!,"Hola me llamo Mireya Hernandez y soy de Garden City Kansas, Conjunto Primavera is #1 y like them alot also because I have El mendozseno in my blood. El Mendozseno is a ranch is Chihuahua,Chih. And that is where Tony Melendez the singer is from! Hurry go buy your Cd!!!"
2,Draggin and dull,"While I usually like books of this nature, I find the Thurlo's lacking in background and cultural knowledge. I won't buy their books again."
5,"A wonderful jump, boogie woogie, and good time blues cd!","This cd features one of todays best boogie woogie pianists, and cretianly the best boogie woogie player in the Los Angeles area today. Palmer plays plenty of hot boogie woogie and good time blues piano solos(this cd is similar to some of Jimmy & Jeannie Cheatham sessions), while backed by a sizzling swing and blues big band, with lot's of great soloists, some great Coleman Hawkins influenced saxaphone, and a wonderful male vocal on ""On The Sunny Side Of the Street"" that sounds like a cross between Joe Williams and Billy Eckstine! This cd has a definite groove, and will be a welcome addition weather your a swing dancer, or just enjoy good time jump blues. Fun music ,for parties."
4,provides an excellent historical basis...,"This book provides a wonderful examination of how emerging communication technologies impact the society that spawned them. Each major media advance (papyrus, parchment, paper, the printing press) causes major shifts in the social paradigms of the societies that adopt its use... definately worth the read. This edition has an afterword by Dr. David Godfrey regarding the impact of the electronic form."
5,Ro-nald Mc-Do-nald . . . Ron-ald Mc-Do-nald . . .,"Each track consists of Mr. Macharyas repeating a name over and over and over again to a background of music and/or noise. If you like that sort of thing -- and who doesn't? -- nobody does it better than Mike.The best track by far is ""Ronald McDonald,"" where he says ""Ronald McDonald"" over and over again in a sing-songy voice like he was taunting a kid named Ronald on the playground. ""Steven Patrick Morrissey,"" where he sounds like a bad medium trying to conjure up Mr. Morrissey's ghost at a seance, is also good."
1,Very poor casting,"I have to agree with Jos Ververgaard, this set as well as the Heroes set is badly cast with discoloration of the models and some air bubbles.This is overshadows the fact that the models are finely detailed, the amount of work needed to make these models representable is not worth itIn all not worth buying"
3,Takes some work to use even without paint,"Good looking figures overall, although the goblins I got are completely identical, not ""uniquely posed"" as the description states. I'm not a fan of the new trend of cookie-cutter bases which need some extra work to hold the figures. The ogre and the orc are the best of the set and have nice detail. The displacer beast is pretty shabby in that it comes in two halves which are far from made to fit together. The ball and socket joints which join the halves aren't even lined up correctly, but it's not quite a fatal flaw as it only has a couple gaps when glued together which can be fixed before painting starts. The dire rat is passable, but I'm not a fan of extra items on a monster figure, such as the treasure chest this one is on. I have no air bubbles in my set. Overall, this set is worth the money although most of the figures are fairly small and require a good amount of preparatory work before you pick up a paintbrush."
3,"Nice collection, with a caveat","This is a good collection of miniatures to start out with. The selection is well chosen, and you get plenty of figures for the price. Unfortunately, I found that most of them had extra bits of metal (called flash) that needed to be removed before they looked right. Also, a small error on the ogre figure is going to require some careful cutting to fix. However, the figures themselves are very nice and detailed, especially the orc and ogre. If you want a good way to start your collection, pick up this box."
5,New insights to Marian thought,"Bertrand's Buby's trilogy concludes with this publication. Volume III discusses the Church Fathers, the Great Western Theologians and others as it unpacks the various elements of Marian thought in the early years of the Church. Mary's virginity, the Mary-Eve parallel, and Marian symbolism are just a few of the subjects covered in an enlightening and clearly written style. Bertrand Buby brings the Blessed Mother out of the shadows of mystery and makes her visible to the reader in ways that are easy to grasp and understand."
4,compilation CD,"The is a best-of for only their first two CD's. Missing some good songs, like ""It Doesn't Matter,"" ""Last Train Home,"" and ""Finally"" all from their True North CD. If you only want to own one LTH CD, or would like a better understanding of their sound, this is your best bet.However, you should do yourself a favor and buy all of them. LTH mixes sad country, moving roots rock, and music-loving bluegrass quite successfully. For those who appreciate good vocals, great guitar playing, moving lyrics."
3,Good new songs - too much rehash of old stuff,"A promising band w/a unique style and the ability to write song lyrics that stick w/you long after you've finished listening. While the band's sophomore commercial efforts ""Love for Sale"" contains several jems, Lean, Lucky and a respectable remake of Heart of Gold,the CD relied too much on rehashed material from their furry broght green shoes CD (about half the songs on the disk). Dissapointed? Somewhat. After waiting 18 months for this CD, I would have gladly waited another 6 months for more new material (as I think most fans would). This leads me to believe that someone was after a quick buck at the expense of the fans. Still, if you are new to C-O, this disk offers a good representation from thier previous effort and is worth listening to."
5,An Obsession With Marlon Brando,"It's sad, but I'm obsessed with Marlon Brando. While everybody else was drooling over JTT and Leo DiCaprio, I was staring at the millions of pictures I'd gotten from various sites. And I mean, the young Marlon Brando. The Marlon Brando from 1950 (The Men) to 1958 (The Young Lions). In that time frame, he was cutest in Sayonara, and Sayonara was also his highest grossing film until the Godfather came along. Personally, I think Sayonara was the greatest movie he ever made. It touched every emotion from anger to romance to complete tragedy. And Brando should have won for best actor, though he was beat out by Humphrey Bogart (I think, don't quote me). Anyway, the movie is awesome, the man is attractive to no end, and now you have no reason not to see it! Do so, and fall in love."
3,Perhaps more interesting for what it represents than what it is,"A Korean War fighter pilot (Marlon Brando) and an enlisted man (Red Buttons) struggle against the institutionalized racism of the American military as they attempt to pursue romances with native-born women (Miiko Taka & Miyoshi Umeki) in post-war Japan. This romantic drama certainly has its flaws. It is too long and Brando's southern accent is terrible. A non-Asian (Ricardo Montalban) with artificially slanted eyes is unfortunately cast as a Japanese in an important role, the plot developments are too reminiscent of soap opera, and the women are stereotypes.On the other hand, there is much to commend it as well. Its critical stance on white racism toward Asians represents an important evolution in Hollywood's attitude toward non-whites. The film is respectful of Japanese culture and the pivotal women's roles are given to Japanese actresses. Filmed on location in Japan, it also offers some interesting glimpses of that country in the 50s."
2,Once is not enough.,Worked once then tape broke on second viewing..For a Classic looked very clear and good sound quality. I will make sure to purchase DVD versions of classics.
2,oh marlon what were you thinking,"ok im young and im so in love with marlon brando's acting that is's just sick ok. But this film was one of his worst of all time. It just didn't do anything for me, The accent he had was horrible. The story line was also lacking. It was a big waste of my time. This whole movie is about loving someone that you cant have and is set in hong kong and tokyo. Im going to say it agian it was just really, really boring."
5,great movie great copy,I have always loved this film...atleast since i caught it on A&E about 17 years ago and have searched for it since then. It was so nice to find it here and the copy is really nice with scene selection and great color. If you love Brando you'll love this film.
5,Good stuff!!,Delivery was fast and the product was just as decribed...NEW.Thank you for being a good seller. It was a pleasure.
1,"Incredible movie, unforgivable DVD!","The one star is to bring attention to the DVD transfer quality. This is a fantastic film! Brando is, as usual, unbelievable!! The greatest actor of all time, in my book, for sure!!!This DVD, however, is unforgivable, an embarrassment to the studio, the movie, and to home video itself. It is 16:9 letterboxed onto 4:3, making it tiny and grainy on a widescreen TV, and the transfer itself is washed out and dull. This is especially annoying since a good HD transfer does exist; I saw it on HDNet movies on DirecTV. That transfer is beautiful.Come on, MGM, bring the HD transfer to Blu-ray!"
5,god bless king britt!,The Reason was the first thing i heard by king britt that honestly and truly knocked me off my seat. the groove is just amazing and the vocals have so much soul in them it's amazing. well worth the effort it takes to track down the cd.
3,book review,An interesting book explaining the process they went through to obtains the monies needed to construct the bridge.An easy read.
3,Customer Review,The textbook was in good condition only thing was it turns out that the class I purchased this book for we only had to read a chapter from the entire book!! :(
1,Absence of Content,"It is rare to see an author tackle such a rich and interesting subject, and write a book so vapid and lacking in content. The material is ""explained"" in terms of inept metaphors and vague hand-waving assertions. After devoting several hours to studying the book, the reader has the feeling that he's ""been had"", since he has acquired nothing in return for his effort. In fact, the author appears to have no more than the faintest grasp of the subject he is writing about."
2,Spend the extra on the German version,"I bought this becasue it was cheaper than the German version Tap Tap Nagelspiel and regretted it once I got the package. While you get a lot more, the pieces and the hammers are plastic - I was expecting wood. One of the hammers broke the first day. My children still enjoy it, but the wooden version is much nicer and I do not expect this one to hold up as long. I ended up just throwing the hammers out and using the one from my previous Tap Tap set."
1,Caution!,"Unfortunately, this collection of songs is sung by The Pioneer Creek Gang, not the original artists. This was not clear in the Amazon information about these CDs. I thought the PCG was the producer or group that put this collection of songs together. The only positive thing about the collection is the humor in how awful the songs sound - however, that humor quickly fades when you realize that you've wasted [your money] Skip this one and go for the real thing. I thought [the price] sounded too good to be true for 2 CDs and all these great songs - and it was!"
3,Only ok,"I was excited about this toy because my son (2 years) is fascinated by the steering wheels in our cars. It only holds his interest for very short periods of time, though. It is also pretty loud. Wasn't as much of a hit as I expected it to be."
4,Kept her attention on the road,"I bought this for my 17 month old daughter to take on a road trip that involved 3 days of driving. It really held her attention for a surprising amount of time. Even by the third day, she was still asking for her ""vroom vroom"" and playing intently. We didn't find it too distracting for driving."
4,Super cute toy,"Super cute. My son likes it. Can't say it keeps him busy for a long time....but nothing does right now. it's got enough on it that its entertaining though.I think its pretty cool, especially since it also speaks Spanish. My husband is Argentinian and I like to find toys that help our son with his Spanish words."
3,Bilengual Driver,"I got this toy for my son for Christmas based on the rave reviews it had. However, this really doesn't hold my son's (one year old) attention. The toy is very cute and durable and we take it out and continue to try to get Trey interested, but this is definitely not one of his favorite toys. :("
5,One of my favorite CDs,"If you liked the international debut album of Frangoulis, ""Sometimes I dream"", you'll be astonished by this double CD. It has more warmth, more passion, and more songs. It features songs in Greek, Italian, English and French, all performed live.The high point of this album is reached at the end of the first CD when he performs songs such as ""Small homeland"" (mikri patrida), ""White page"" (selida lefki) and the song ""Ton eafto tou paidi"". At this point, his warm passionate voice overwhelms the listener with emotions. Also worth noting is his performance of the French classic ""Ne me quitte pas"" from Jacques Brel and the dark ""Empty chairs at empty tables"" at the beginning of the second CD.My only criticism to this CD is perhaps the less interesting performance of his female co-singer, which simply does not always match his own talent.Nevertheless, I consider this CD as one of the most beautiful CDs I own."
5,YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO LOVE THIS ONE!,"...EVEN IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LYRICS TO SOME SONGS, THE GREAT MAGIC IS IN MARIO'S VOICE. GO AHEAD, BUY IT. I PROMISE, YOU WON'T REGRET IT."
1,Grill was no bargain.,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. The grill was billed as a super discount item, that I found in many other stores for the same money. The grill was a gift and was damaged in transport, so I opted for a refund and bought a bigger grill for less money."
3,Entertaining but not Awe Inspiring,"I love GITS and the deep and complex stories as well as the thought provoking topics and ideas that are created by the writers. This book was a little snip-it of Batou's life and his dog. It was fun and creative but was a little dull in some places, but mostly it fell short due to translation problems. You'll see if you read it somethings just don't make sense. Overall i enjoyed the quick read."
4,Decent,"I found this book to be quite helpful with the sequencing of the activities, and the DIY tips were nice as well."
5,Incredible for the price,"I got two of these for overhead mics on my drums. I wasn't expecting much for the price, but I was blown away by the sound quality of these things. My drum recordings went from sounding bad to excellent. Worth every penny times 10. A sample recording with Apex 435s as overheads: [...]"
1,"Beware, defective mic and deceptive seller!","The used mic being offered here has a loose capsule and was just returned by me after a long hassle with the seller, Audiomidi.com. But a new one with Amazon's return policy instead of taking a chance by saving $9."
3,Eh,"I had trouble getting into this one. Only one time thru so far. It doesn't compare to ""Narita"" which I thoroughly enjoy."
1,Refused,"I refused that product because you made wrongly two orders for me at the same date. I received the first ""Thundersteel"" CD on 30th january.You have now to pay me back for the second purchase.Philippe GUERRA"
3,I think Ampad is listening to us via our feedback,"I reviewed this company's other recycled brown catalog envelope finding it very wanting. That envelope is no longer being made by this company. Instead they have created this envelope as a replacement. It has glue on both sides of the center opening (just like the other) but has a ""reuseable clasp"" and ""reinforced eyelet"" which take care of the center part of the back of the envelope making it more secure for shipping. I didn't think I would buy from this company again but when my small cottage industry ran out of envelopes, I decided to give them one more chance! So far so good...glue down center of back and along bottom and top seem to work better. Thanks for listening Ampad."
2,Bad quality,The product did not turnout the way it was mentioned and displayed. The gsm was bad and the thickness was also lacking.
5,unique and cool,"This brown paper is unique and cool because it looks like you care about the environment (since it's recycled), even if you don't. It feels vintage. Recommend."
2,OK for the basic beginner only!,"Combined with some hands on advice and training this book is only useful for the person with few computer skills and no knowledge of Notes. If the person is computer literate, say with Microsoft Office, then the money is better spent with a more intermediate text such as Lotus Notes in 24hrs by Sams. For the money, I feel any user would be better off putting the money toward a more robust volume for the beginner/intermediate user. In our case, we wasted our money."
3,Good but not as good as the first,"Originally titled Secret Rivals II, similar cast as the first and the kungfu is probably better than the first one, but a loss of Wong Tao in this film is bad. I would have rather see them cut out John Liu. The movie is about the twin of the evil guy killed in the first movie seeking revenge against those who killed his brother."
5,LIKE LIKE MOM USED TO READ TO ME!,"This is a timeless classic! Love the book....!Word and pictures are cute, and it is also educational for children.A fun book as well."
2,Way over priced,My son never really cared for this toy. The toy was very overpriced. It was a total waste of money.
1,The book is further evidence of the title.,"I purchased ""The Flight From Science And Reason"" to seek further support for the notion that understanding is decaying in my community, and I was not disappointed. Evidence of the decline of the ability to reason was supplied by every article, but not just by their exposure of the absurdity of some populist notions, but by the absence of plain English from the whole work. The arguments put forward lack clarity and simplicity, while employing unduly long words mixed with made up words. Though some articles are just ponderous others are incomprehensible ravings."
3,"break very easily, colors seem toxic","I had to tell to my son those are mickies. It's not very clear as those are really small. I don't like all those sprinkles etc, as it is pure sugar in the best scenario plus toxic looking colors. But have no way to avoid those with my son... hope it will go with age..."
5,Exactly what I wanted!,"These are perfect and super cute, they were exactly what I wanted to finish off my daughters 1st birthday cupcakes and cake. The colors are just as vibrant as the picture. The only downfall was that there were quite a few broken ones but they were still adorable on the cakes, so much so that I ordered a second bag after doing the test cake. I'm going to solely use these instead of attempting to draw his face again. I will definitely shop again!"
1,Fresh??,Urrghhh!! There is nothing fresh about this scent. Why did my curiosity have to get the best of me? I should have stuck with Baby Powder scent. I just hope their Baby Powder version is pleasant to the olfactory system since this one is an assault to it!
5,The Jewish Emergence from Powerlessness,"Gun control is a burning issue in America today. Bauer raises legitiate concerns about this issue in relation to the ability of the Jewish people to protect themselves from tyranny and extermination during the Nazi era. Bauer discusses the inability of the Jewish people to defend themselves before, and during, the Holocaust because of anti-gun laws which disarmed the civilian population. Though commentary on armed resistance is only a portion of the book; this section alone made the writing worth the money spent, and has profoundly affected my stance on private gun ownership."
2,Very disappointed,"Overall I've enjoyed the storytelling very visual until the end.It just seemed the end was rushed,and was saved for the very last few pages of the book. It left me puzzled I was like ""Get out of here, You must be joking all this great storytelling,and it ends in such a tame lame fashion"". Did the author have a plane to catch? Too bad all the energy and excitement 3/4 of the book is drained away by the 1/4 ending what a shame."
1,"utter crap, anyone?","this person is a terrible writer. the plot is ridiculously contrived, the explicit sexual descriptions are overdone and the crow theme has been tarnished by this story. the only people who should ever read this book are hardcore crow fans. and then only to say you have."
3,What Was I Thinking?,"What was I on with my last review for this book? Anyways, being the 4th book so far in the series, it did manage to add some different elements, like past lives and supernatural forces. I liked the fact that Stephen Lelliot could call upon crows to help him in his journey. What I didn't like though was that the action didn't start until 3/4 of the story. That and the end battle was very confusing and what I could understand, there wasn't enough happening. Also, the villian,""Dirk Temple"" seemed like a cousin to the bad guy,""Joseph Lethe"" in Lazarus Heart. Too many times for that type of character in my honest opinion. Out of all these books so far, Clash By Night is the best one(in my honest opinion)."
3,"Good, but...","As a fan of the ""Dark Fiction"" (alright, horror!) genre I have enjoyed the various entries into the Crow universe. I must point out that I truly loved both Poppy Brite's and David Bischoff's entries into the field. Sometow leaves me flat. Flat is the best word to decribe the entire work. I've not read much written by the man, but the reader is left with a distinct sense of distance throughout the thje piece. Perhaps this is an embodiment of the often stated Bhuddist notion that life is illusion, so we should not be overly concerened with what goes on on earth. Unfortunately, this philosophy acrries over in the book and one doesn't really care about the characters, the events, or the settings. Its a great deal of beautiful fluff waiting for plot and characterization to save it."
3,It Was Alright,"I am a big fan of The Crow, so naturally I had to check it out. All in all, it was a good book. Some parts a little grotesque and the ending a little to short, but all in all a good book. It had me intrested in to try out another Crow series book."
3,an alright book,this to me did not seem like a crow book. it was to magical and the crow is only in the book himself for about 15 pages its a alright book but dont read it expecting to see the crow.
4,A good beach read,"Everything you'd expect in a beach read, astutely observed and well researched, if a bit predictable. The characters seem a little too stock and not original enough, not like people you know, which would heighten the suspense. A very good writer delivering a solid mystery, but it would be fun to see him try something truly original and out of his margin of comfort."
4,"A Good, Fun Beach Read","This was a good, fun beach read. If you are looking for something deep, then this is not the book for you. It was a quick read, and I enjoyed it."
2,Formulaic departure lounge novel,"It didn't really hold any surprises, especially having read the previous books with the main protagonists. Picking the outcome became clearer as the book progressed. However not a bad read when looking for something mind numbing and unthinking to do. What was really disappointing though was the amount of errors in the book. Grammar, spelling, missing words, typos etc.... for an online book this was not only frustrating but unforgiveable. For an author with multiple publications and who, according to his own website, pioneered the ebook format it was perplexing it got out of the editors computer. Basic spell check programs would have picked up most of the errors. This is why it has two rather than three stars."
3,A fulfilling McCallum story,"In this story I found the writing to be everything I expected. Prescott never fails to write characters solidly and with just enough personal insight to keep them interesting. Tess is back in LA helping to stop a serial killer. The story introdcues us to Abby, an engaging but perhaps overly produced character we find recurring in other stories. But the two together save the day for a least one potential victim. As far as the plot goes, it was tight enough, but I found the title character's contact/partner to be predictable. All-in-all this was a good read. I'm sure you'll find it entertaining. On to the next in the series."
3,"Not as thrilling as I had hoped, but still a good read","I've read several of Mr. Prescott's previous novels and enjoyed them all. This one wasn't as exciting as I had thought it would be, but still I enjoyed it. I will read the original book feature Abby Sinclair."
3,"Entertaining read, as usual","I really enjoyed Dangerous Games and as in all of Michael Prescott's novels, he creates characters and events that draw us in and excite us to keep reading! I definatly will!"
4,Engrossing and entertaining,This is a book both engrossing and entertaining. A quick and very easy read. I'll try some other of his books.
2,Disappointing,"I've read all of Michael Prescott's novels and loved them all except this one. DANGEROUS GAMES was a major disappointment.I hate having to admit it, but I found it so boring that I couldn't even finish it.Hopefully his next one will be better."
4,Another great Prescott read,I love this guy - Dangerous Games is the third Prescott book I have read and I plan to make his books one of my guilty pleasures.
3,Just so-so,"This is my first Prescott book and probably will be my last, as well. I couldn't connect with any of the characters. Both the female leads were brash, rude, and not real likable. The plot line was interesting, but like another reader commented, it's not real likely that a major city would pay a ransom in such a situation. The book did hold my attention; it was not boring. I'm glad it was a daily special so I didn't pay full price."
5,Dangerous game time,Michael Prescott always comes through with an exciting read.This had a surprise twist near the ending. I think someof his characters are so funny and so believable.I am never disappointed with a Michael Prescott story!
5,Greek mythology,"Too bad Dr Who isn't remade on DVD. Tom Baker was the best, and this one was difficult to find. The British know how to act without all the special effects."
1,Caveat emptor!,"Ai yi yi! Another bottom-of-the-barrel release from the abominable season 17! If you are not familiar with stories from this season you should avoid all of them except 'City of Death'Doctor Who: City of Death (Story 105). It resembles a British Christmas pantomime more than a good Doctor Who story. Tom Baker was bored with the process and decided to make his own fun by going off-script and way over-the-top. Fun for him, deadly for the overall production (although even Tom Baker at his best couldn't have saved this mess). A serious contender for one of the worst Whos ever made. Save your money for the really good Tom Baker stories that have yet to be released on DVD like Seeds of Doom and Terror of the Zygons.For masochistic completists only!"
4,the most UNDERrated show on Television Period,"Although I can't really rate it five stars, I can rate it four. This is a good adventure that probably few love, many hate, and most don't even know about(even so-called whoivans don't know it). It has an excellent cast of character actors and cool sets and back drops. The story is about a race of bull/buffalo-like humanoids who use black holes to traverse from place to place. What I like is not it's ""realism"" but its fun factor and humor. The atmosphere is farout as well. I first watched this as a kid and loved it all the way through highschool it was broadcast many times then fatefully, Doctor Who was banned from PBS in the US 1988 Feburary 27th and I never got to see it again until now."
1,This man thinks we are all stupid,"I was predisposed to agree with Mr. Wanjek -- I bought the book for ammunition. But his elitism, constant denigration of TV watchers (of which I am not one), insults of people who disagree with his positions, and sneering at or ignorance of the science that *does* support a number of herbal remedies put me right off. There are better books on the topic, including physicians' handbooks that are quite readable, and which make clear which remedies are scientifically supported and which aren't. I suggest that prospective buyers shop around for something a little less insulting to their intelligence."
2,OK If you actually think this is a good book i am sorry,"It's not that this book is horrible, but come on. Does anyone see how redundant everything is? How many different ways can you say the same thing over and over and over. I mean do I look like a complete idiot or something and didn't get it the first 3 times you said that? The information in the book is also someone bland. I guess if you have never picked up a health book and even a magazine you would think this is such great information. Well, I hate to break it to you, it's nothing kept in the dark. I am so bored when I read this book. If you like to read books before you go to bed, this one will surely put you to sleep."
1,acer service terrible,"do not buy an acer unless you never need service-hah!absolutely under no conditions buy acer, they do not service what they sell."
5,A GREAT STORY CONTIUNES IN BOOK FOUR,"I got this book sometime ago and I am very surprised that this author's books has not taken off in sales. In this fourth book, Willard takes on the horror of the Vietnam war. The story seems to be more edgey. The edge in this story is probably because Willard is a highly decorated paratrooper. The characters comes off as real people. And because TW has witness war firsthand, it really shows in the writing. TW deals with issues peculiar to blacks in the military with insight and compassion. This is a history lesson told in an adventurous, dramatic and sometimes a funny way. TW next book deals with a member of the Sharp family in Desert Storm. Those of you who have not read the Sabre Chronicle need to check out this great story for the first time. I recommend you start from the first book named Buffalo Soldier, then The Sable Doughboys and later the Wings of Honor. This story will not disappoint; guaranteed !!!!"
4,Unique monograph will delight serious Sherlockians,"Forensic Investigator Thomas Hanratty selected and sketched crime scenes from seventeen Sherlock Holmes stories--out of sixty.Done in the style ofHans Gross, the sketches are as Holmes might have drawn in his notebook, if he used one. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's own stories are descriptive, to be sure, though generally enjoyed without the benefit of illustrations. The classic pen and ink sketches from the likes of Sidney Paget and Frederic Dorr Steele tend to focus on our two main characters, of course.Several paragraphs from each relevant story are included alongside Hanratty's sketches, setting the scene, so to speak. I would have liked more selections from the canon, and the typographic style clearly dates this amateur yet sincere effort.Privately printed, 1976. Comb bound, landscape layout."
5,Simple yet effective,"I'm on a wellness kick. Why wait till you get ill before you do something for your health. 6-degress of freedom, simply 25 minutes every morning and after 4 weeks I CAN tell a difference. Do yourself a favor and commit to Warrior Wellness for yourself and your family. Per the author's suggestion I have not attempted the intermediate or advanced workouts yet ... I am waiting the recommended 6 months."
3,"Good, but why put down other systems?","This is a good way to keep joints working. I just don't understand why Sonnen has to put his ideas above others'. His claims that this will help 'fix the damage' caused by other modalities, including yoga, is very misleading: Properly done, yoga, (or even weightlifting), is perfectly healthy, while done sloppily, even 'Warrior Wellness' can cause injury,(I've since seen Sonnen doing plyometrics, which are notorious for causing injuries). Decades, (even centuries, in the case of yoga) of benefit, make Scott's put-downs seem juvenile, especially considering that his copyrighted ""Prasara"" -is- yoga, along with much of 'Warrior Wellness'. If you compare his work to the performances of any expert, whether an Ashtanga adept, or even a top-flight highschool gymnast, Sonnens 'way' breaks down to mid-level ability at best in performances of multiple arts: Nothing wrong with that, but leave the real guys alone."
3,mature vocals - silly lyrics,"There is one thing I really cannot stand with this artist and specially with this new CD: the overall dull, meaningless and even silly lyrics: ""Oh girl I'm missing you so, life is nothing without you, I want you, I want you so, I'm crazy about you, wanna touch you, wanna see you, wanna feel you, give you all I've got, you're everything I need, fulfilling all my dreams""...like that! Incredible, since this vocalist is far from being a teenager. Everybody knows that Glenn Jones definitely can sing, and the music is not bad at all (despite some tracks being a bit boring) - it's the awful lyrics that spoil the quality. Very sad and very annoying!"
4,cute tent,"I have a 4 year old son who loved this tent. It fits nicely on the bed. When I am ready to take it down or put it up, I can do it very easily."
2,Express Train Bed Tent,"This product is ok, but my almost 3yr. old son has not used it very much. It's ok to play in I guess but the fabric is hot and holds in a lot of body heat. Perhaps if the mesh windows were bigger to allow more ventilation and if the floor of the tent could be a cotton fabric it might be more comfortable to be in."
5,Glorious,This band is fantastic. There's a little bit of Beatles flavor with that Austin twist. Definately check them out; it's music that can only be enjoyed.
4,Mary's Place; if you thought Callahan's was wierd.....,"Although Callahan's crosstime saloon was vaporized into a sizzling crater, the gang is all back. A new bar is open; called ""Mary's Place"" in rememberance of Calahan's daughter. The puns, wierdness, and genuine camadarie are just as strong as ever...in addition to an un-lucky duck, a guilty scientist, a walking thirst, a computer that turns itsself on, and a surprise appearance (sic) by an old favorite. Grab an Irish coffee, curl up with this book, and laugh until you cry with those folks we're so fond of"
3,Only Tangentially House of M Related,"This is a pretty good story, but this is being billed as a House of M Prelude, when only a handful of pages of this collection are really about the House of M thread. The vast majority of this book is about the Weaponeers doing some kind of coup in a small country and several Excalibur and X-Men members team up to stop it. It has Angel in it, Calisto, and a few other mutants that serious X-fans probably recognized but I didn't. Then there is a small side-show story involving Professor Xavier and Magneto's attempts to help cure the Scarlet Witch. If you want an actual prelude to House of M then I recommend reading Avengers 500 - 503, which is the ""Disassembled"" story line arc. That's a damn fine comic story. This one in Excalibur is a good story, but it's being billed as something it really isn't, and that's why I give it a somewhat low score."
2,Unnecessary,"Billed as a ""prelude"" to Brian Michael Bendis' House of M event, there is really nothing here that any reader, newbie or veteran, will have to read to get the big picture. After the Scarlet Witch goes crazy and slaughters the Avengers, she is taken to Genosha by her father Magneto who, along with Professor Xavier, seek to repair her broken mind. Naturally, as anyone who has read House of M knows, that is easier said than done. There's also some additional stories including interaction between Archangel and Calisto, but there's really nothing here that would be needed to know what is going on in the long run. Legendary X-Men scribe Chris Claremont doesn't do much here to add any kind of flare, but Aaron Lopresti's art is pretty good mostly. If you want a read ""prelude"" to House of M, check out Bendis' Avengers Disassembled storyline, which leads to the House of M, which would lead to the current shattering events of the Civil War."
3,"Good, but not needed to understand House of M!!!!","It has a decent battle in it between Angel, Husk, other mutants and a group of killers called the Weaponeers.It also has a story featuring Pro. X, Dr. Strange and Scarlett Witch that leads into House of M.However, it's not needed to understand the House of M books. Everything is re-explained several times in the House of M tpb."
3,Story's not bad - but it's not really got much to do with House of M,"Nearly the entire book is about Excalibur and the Weaponeers, with only blurbs in the first chapter, and the entire last chapter being actual House of M material. Overall though, the story is pretty good, I liked it.What's criminal, however, is vendors on Amazon selling this book for excess of $40. This is one of the cheapest Trade Paperbacks from the House of M collection, only being 11.99 as printed on it's cover. You can probably find this book at your local comic shop for cover price, and you'd still not be paying anywhere near the highway robbery that are these Amazon vendor prices. Heck, if you even had to drive to another city or town to a comic book shop to find this title, you'd still not be paying anywhere near what these Amazon vendors are charging. So don't buy from Amazon, you'll save a ton more cash if you buy it from a store."
5,GREAT!,I'M A FAN OF THE HAMMER AND THIS ONE IS A BLAST! ORIGINAL GANGSTAS IS TOO MUCH FUN! LOVED EVERY SECOND OF THIS!
3,I remember those times,I was born in Gary Indiana where this story is supposed to take place. I used to buy donuts from the bakery and go to the theater that is mentioned in this movie. I was even born at the hospital were Fred Williamson's character goes to see his father. Fortunately for me I joined the service just as the city was starting to decay. I enjoyed watching some of my favorite black action stars walking the same streets as I did when I was kid. For nostalgia's sake it is a good film.
3,great re-union of 70's actionmovie st ars,"if your a film buff, and wanted to see just outta curiositywhat happened to the black star's of the early 70's...see this movie, sorry to say that most of the aging star's except for pam grier now could be cast in a new version of sanford and son...as fred's old buddies from the hood drinkinggrape ripple. it was a good social commentary of life in gary,indiana and how dependent that city was on the steel mills and the off shoot business's that gradually closed down, see this movie on a saturday afternoon,,,but if you have to mow the lawn or paint the house...you'd be better off doing that."
2,good idea but bad come out,"Fred Williamson(Black Ceasar, From Dusk Till Dawn) is John Bookman and he returns home after his father is shot up by a gang called the rebels, a gang he formed back in his day, led by Spyro and Damien..two ruthless thugs who changed the gang from what it used to be, the rebels think they own the streets. well Bookman and co. join forces to try to stop them. an allstar cast including Jim Brown(Mars Attacks,Salughter) Ron O'Neal(Superfly), Pam Grier(Ghost Of Mars, Foxy Brown, Jackie Brown), Paul Winfield(Mars Attacks, The Terminator), Richard Roundtree(Antitrust, Shaft, Corky Romando) and many more. takes its toll on the 70's black films but is too much uninspired with wooden performances and a lack of, anything...was expecting much more"
5,You must own a copy of this!,"Saw 'Focus' perform live once. Had to have the CD after that.All of the performers shared their personal testimonies of how God had dramatically worked in their lives. You hear that in each powerful track.This is my all time favorite album. Whenever I need a boost, this is where I go. I only wish there was more.Focus, I pray you are all doing well."
3,Pretty Good but...............,"Got introduced to George Haslam through his two excellent efforts with Mal Waldron.His Baritone is hard to peg outside/inside (in that order) with a penchant for South American music (three volumes of Argentine Adventures).He also combines string avant guarde in an interesting blend.But the one that really knocked me out was another Slam (I think) release called ""Cuban Meltdown"" which is a small big band with UK and Cuban musicians.But almost all of Haslam's stuff is accessible even to the person who thinks they don't like ""out"" music because he really isn't that atonal or out.So check the Waldron Duo's and ""Cuban Meltdown"" first before the Argentine CD's but what I have heard I liked.CheersChazz"
5,Great CD!,"This is one of Mariah's better single's. The remixs are awsome! And the So So Def is version is tied into Biggie's part of ""It's all about the Benjumins"". Tracklisting: 1. Album Verison 2. Bad Boy Remix (featuring Ma$e & the Lox) 3. Classic Mix 4. So So Def Remix (featuring JD & Da Brat) 5. Classic Instrumental. Go on and buy it."
5,MULTI-TALENTED,"she is one singer that is multi-talented and multi-faceted, she has a real great innate talent in writting and also a real superb natural vocals that soar high and high...HONEY is one song thaat display her unique ways she display her talents in singing ballards and street rhythmn"
1,"A ""No Go"" It ain't of fire.","It's too bad that someone can't just stay pristine and beautiful in the world of the music business...or at least pretend to. Ms. Carey takes her singing, producing, songwriting and overall act to new depths. A song as lude as ""Honey"" doesn't constitute four (bad) remixes that all sound the same, except for that AWFUL rapping noise that sounds surprisingly like...what? Talking? Mariah, you aren't on fire. You're ice cold."
5,Great single!,"This is my favorite single. I want to get the #1's CD, but I'm not sure if my mom will let me. I'll have to get the lyrics."
2,Enter Mariah the Slut,"Mariah started to lose me as a fan when this song came out. I've always regarded Mariah as a meaningful songwriter who writes lyrics about important topics (""Make It Happen"", ""Hero"", etc.)but this song is all about sex. Leave that to Madonna and Janet! And she doesn't use her seven-octave range at ALL!I haven't bought a Mariah album since ""Rainbow"" and probably never will."
2,"Never in my life had ""Sand"" in Zaatar",I have purchased this product 3 times and have found this to be the only Zaatar to have hard SANDY particles mixed in with the spices. I would recommend to avoid this brand of Zaatar unless you want chipped teeth. There doesn't appear to be any date on the jar of when it was packaged.
1,Don't waste your money,"I have no idea why this book is so highly rated. The writing is cutesy and the ""advice"" is absolutely basic at best, and most of it is repeated in section after section. I am a first time mom with very little experience with babies, and I already knew to try most of the tricks in here - most are just common sense. To prospective moms out there - trust me, you already know most of this stuff, too. trust your instincts with your baby and save $10."
2,"Unless you have NO idea what youre doing, I'd skip it","I thought most of the info in this book was pretty common sense. Its sort of a cute little book which is why I gave it two stars, but I didn't learn anything from it."
5,"great movie,great acting","very realistic and raw,the fact that their are people out in the world just like these guys makes it even creepier,i agree with the other reviews the goofballs that gave it one star should stick to disney films,if you watch a movie based on true serial killings expect violence. the entire cast is believable and i agree some parts could have moved faster, but overall an intense flick."
1,Just Plain Bad,"Bad Acting, If You Want To See This Movie Try To Get A VHS Copy With DENNIS FARINA. Don't Waste Your Money On This. Dennis Farina was in The Made For TV movie, The Hillside Strangler And It Was FANTASTICK."
1,This Movie IS SO Incredibly....,"Dull,Stupid,Boring,But the casting was really bad. Direct to vid star C. Thomas Howell still can't act his way out of a paperbag. Nicolas Turturro (NYPD Blue) is equally unapealling as Angelo. Both are losers who take out their aggression on females. Not much character development. But not much fear or menace either. I know less about the infamous case than I did when I saw this movie. I enjoyed the bio-pics ""Gacy,"" ""ED Gein,"" and ""Ted Bundy."" This is not in that league. Skip this one folks and buy the three mentioned above, or the director's earlier work ""Dahmer."" Those movies capture the real menace and horror of their crimes. This movie is just criminal."
4,Nora Roberts Irish Trilogy,"As always, Nora Roberts writes a good romatic story. I have only read the first book in the trilogy and really enjoyed it. I look forward to reading the next two books."
5,Find Your Own Way Home (2007),"Find Your Own Way Home is Reo Speedwagon's first album of new material in eleven years. This version of the album comes with Hi Infidelity Live Again and a dvd of interviews and performances from XM studios. With this edition of Find Your Own Way Home you get a lot of bang for your buck! Find Your Own Way Home is possibly Reo's best album since 1981's Hi Infidelity. Smilin' in the End, Find Your Own Way Home, and Dangerous Combination are just a few of the highlights.For Hi Infidelity Live Again, it contains the whole album Hi Infidelity recorded live in the XM studios. While of course it isn't as great as the original album, but it is very well performed and a lot of fun to listen too.The final disc is a dvd of Reo performing some live songs and answering a few questions in between. You got to hear the acoustic version of Ridin' the Storm.Overall, a great package. I would recommend this to all Reo Speedwagon fans."
5,"Incredible art, amazing story!!","Finally, America is starting to wise up and realize the value of translating artbooks-- common in Japan -- so that we can enjoy the lush color and technique that is usually edited to a blurry black and white copy when it makes its way stateside.Kaori Yuki is no less than a genius, and her work truly shines when you see the depth of her artwork.Angels and devils; not all beautiful, not all ugly, but all seriously intriguing and entertaining. This is a must see!!"
5,perfect second artbook,un super bouquin d'artwork pour les fans du manga angel sanctuary. les images sont superbes comme d'habitude et le livre est un très bel objet
2,Outrageous!!!!,"I have all the Karen E. Taylor books except this one, but I don't think this book is worth paying $20.00 for. I love all of these books but I think it's outrageous to pay so much for it!"
1,"great, a slick way to lose your phone","this item has the obvious benefit of protecting the phone from damage.the down side is the clip that attaches to whatever, will, and i repeat, will, come lose and your phone will fall with the possibility of you not knowing. good bye phone.this is an item that only strikes me as a joke. it will protect the phone from a fall so that the person who finds it will be tickled to find a very expensive device in perfect working order.people who create such an accessory obviously do it only to sell something. it is never tested for usefulness.jlw."
3,Dust Off Your Bible and Get Ready...,"I echo the words of a previous reviewer: this is a ""fun"" read. Not only is Shea bright and funny, but the tools with which he equips you in this book (almost without you even knowing it) will stay with you forever, and drastically change the way you read the bible.Borrowing from the wisdom of the early Church Fathers, Shea shows us how to read the bible with a new pair of eyes, eyes that will penetrate deeper and deeper into these all-too-familiar texts.As a newcomer to Catholicism, I've been absolutely reveling in this revolutionary (if something 2,000 years old can be called such) way of reading Scripture. I've begun to host bible studies using this method, and the attendents are loving it! I had one girl say, ""I've never read the bible like this - this changes everything.""Let Shea introduce you to the early Christians, and let him show you how to read and learn the bible."
5,making senses out of scripture by mark shea,this is my all time favorite book on scripture. after reading you'll wonder why this is'nt manditory for all christians to read. I will never look at the bible in the same way again.
2,I loved Velocity Girl....,"I loved Velocity Girl- Forgotten Favorite and Crazy Town are my favorite tracks. So when I found out Sarah went out on her own and tried a different style that was compared to Burt Bacharach with Dionne Warwick, I picked up the disk. The voice was still great but the song construction and melodies are lacking. I listened to the disk twice and have put it on the shelf."
1,don't buy,"this is the most disgusting thing i even drunk. it has the worst taste imaginable. i put sugar in it so i could drink it and not waste it, and that STILL didn't help. i would not recommend buying it. i didn't buy it from here though i bought it from Jewel."
2,Misleading Title,"Actually this particular simpsons episode (2 of them) were not up to the standard. Eventhough I am a big fan of Simpsons I could not watch this one completely. ""Monorail was a tragedy"". and Marge's acting along with Ned was stupid."
5,The Best Love Story Since...,"Sophie's Choice or even Anna Karenina! Set in New York and St. Petersburg! From the man's point of view! Gorgeously written! Darkly Humorous! This book does New York justice, it does women justice, it does love justice. I couldn't ask for anything more."
4,"For all those who have/had a ""Russian Phase""","I loved reading this book, having being a Russophile for a few years. While an extremely smooth read, it is clear the writer's insights comes from a very personal relationship with Russia and Russians, and I could identify with much of what was in these pages. The book does not pretend at great literary achievement, but its insights are very human and very real, and the readings into Katya's psyche and the author's ambivalent emotions about her are something I could readily identify with and for me, in spite, and perhaps because of its unpretentiousness, it was one of the best novels I have read in the last three years. A very genuine work."
1,unchargeable as delivered,"The Sakar battery refuses to engage the charging circuit on the camera. Therefore the Sakar battery is unchargable. The factory battery charges fine. I've called their customer service. They will charge me 6.95 to exchange the battery. I figure that by the time I've paid to have the original battery shipped to me, then paid to have the defective battery shipped to the return point, and then pay them 6.95 for the privilege of getting what I should have gotten to begin with (a working battery). I haven't saved very much money at all by buying this product now have I ?"
1,No fit on ZR85,Purchased this battery for our ZR85 and the mounting slide does not fit tight enough to recharge it. Now we are having to pay shipping charges on its return. The Canon BP535 says it fits all ZR style cameras. What's up?????
1,Don't buy this if you have Windows 2000!,"After much driver patching and updating, I managed to get all of the discs to install and play a little on Windows 2000, but the ""Elmo's Preschool"" and ""Elmo Through the Looking Glass"" discs will lock up our computer HARD (requiring a cold boot to fix) after 5-10 minutes of play. The ""Sesame Street Preschool"" disc hasn't locked up, but we can't hear any SOUND with it, so that sure doesn't make it playable either. My 33-month old son was very disappointed and keeps saying ""Elmo's broken"". :("
3,Good CD to own if you buy only one AoL CD,"this is my first Archers of Loaf CD and it just so happens to be a culmination of b-sides and some new works. of course, this was back in 1996 when the CD was released.anyway - a lot of this sounds kinda dated, but that doesn't make it bad. i actually enjoy a lot of it; it reminds me of the when indie started to be ""big."" lots of these songs remind me of early Soul Asylum and some Jon Spencer Blues Explosion...not so much for an exact sound but as a style. i also feel like i am listening to a progression of the Pixies.if you are looking at getting a single AoL disc, i can't see that this one is a bad way to go. ""Wrong,"" ""Quinn Beast,"" and ""What Did You Expect"" are all standout tracks for me...but I really did enjoy them all.enjoy!"
1,Did nothing for me,"I bought this hoping to get reasonable reception in an urban area away from serious geographical barriers and broadcast interference. I didn't. In fact, I got better reception for some channels with a plain coaxial cable."
1,Don't waste your money,"I wasted my money on this piece of garbage. I pick up about three times as many stations with my old rabbit ears. I'm pretty sure I'd be better off jamming a length of wire into the back of my TV rather than using that antenna. I even disassembled the unit, hoping to find that a lead wire had come loose, leading to the utterly miserable reception, but no dice. Also worth noting: the build quality is pretty poor, and the co-ax connector is the push-on type rather than the (much better) screw-on type. Spend your money on something else."
2,Not what I was hoping for.,"I had been using a single rabbit ear on my HDTV and was able to pick up more than half the digital broadcasts in my area. With this antenna I get one less. It's a nice design and easy to set up, but users will experience results relative to their location or distance from the broadcast towers. It can be great for some while doing almost nothing for others. Basically it's a dice roll."
4,TERK TV4 Indoor Ant.,Very good clear reception in Jacksonville Fl. However bear in mind I amonly about 7 mi. from the transmitting towers for all the local stations.
3,Too easy,"As a single guy, I love to glance at books about dating regardless of who they're written for. (Actually, I pay close attention to what the women's books say about where to meet men.)I found this book amusing in that it boils down a complex process (meeting your future spouse) to a short checklist. It's easy to find counterexamples, at least among my married friends, but the interesting part was how the list describes a set of behaviors that an ""ideal"" man should follow. Making the first move, calling within a certain timeframe, etc. (Never mind that these actions will be considered ""creepy"" if the man is unattractive.) It's like a recipe for how a woman (or the authors) hope to be swept off their feet.Even though dating and mating is too complex to boil down to a checklist, some of the authors' points are decent and probably correlate with marriage-minded men, even though the correlations may be weak and, as a list, incomplete."
4,if you're with the wrong one,"I don't think this book is good if you're looking for marriage and not in a relatioship because you will probably marry the first man who exhibites everything on the list. It does seem like despiration. This book is good for if you want to get married and you are already in a relationship. This helps you determine if it's going anywhere so you can take the necessary steps (get rid of him or realize you don't have a future and just have fun in the now).This book is a guide for women who are ready to settle down. I don't agree that it only takes a month because I had a list guy and it took three months (maybe because we were 19). However, I do believe you can see signs in the first month that says he's NOT going to marry you in the future.This book is good on telling you if the guy is ready for marriage. What it fails to ask is if you are ready to marry this guy."
4,Although At First Read I Didn't Understand....,"""The List"" Completely, I would recommend this book....Yes women are attractive at all ages...However, it is NOT optimal to wait till the 12th of never to get serious about getting married and starting a family...Author OfBlack Women Deserve Better"
5,Wasting Time,"If you have been in a relationship with no commitment for some time, you are just servicing the man till he finds his list woman. When he does you will be out and she will marry the man you thought was for you. There is magic in a relationship that will lead to marriage, and these writers have nailed all the important signs.Great read!!!!!!!"
5,The List,"5 Stars 3 thumbs up...I saw the authors being interviewed on FoxNews ""Dayside"" January 20th, 2006 - Very impressive women...Looking for a great reference guide as to ""how you would know if your man is the one"" and will he marry you...Buy a copy of ""The List"" by Mary Corbett and Sheila Corbett Kihne. Trust me when I say that I followed their tips and after 4 months I'm on my way down the isle. The authors nailed it! I love their advice ""dump him"" This is an easy-to-read and one book you'll go back to again and again...until you get it right!"
2,not practical,"This book is not really recommended, it will cause you to feel that your relationship isn't right when it could very well be headed in the right direction, just because he didn't follow some list items. Its a bit crazy, and I think that the best thing to do is enjoy your life, because you only go around once and you should live on your own terms, defining your own happiness. Enjoy your time together rather than analyzing everything. The list probably could weed out some guys who are just plain bad but its not a surefire method. It will make you insecure if anything..."
4,Great guide!,"This book was recommended to me by my best friend.For the last few years, I've had a hard time finding guys that were worthwhile, and for a long time I wondered why. In the last year or so, I realized that it's the kind of guy I attract - commitment-phobes. If all you find are the wrong kind of guys, it's impossible to find the right one!This book really helped me pinpoint the guys that were worth my time. If you're a woman my age who is ready to get married (I'm 32), you don't want to waste any more time with the wrong guy. I used to give most men the benefit of the doubt, but this book has tipped me off to a lot of signs that a man isn't ready to settle down.Ladies, if you're looking for a man who's ""light is on"" as they say in Sex and the City, then this book is for you!"
4,"Good, but not as good as the previous sets","This set has, as always, 6 excellent episodes. But it lacks the Tracey Ullman shorts that came with the previous four sets. The shorts are replaced with a montage of some prank calls to Moe, which is the same in each video (and cuts out Moe's responses, which is dissapointing). The first video includes ""Marge vs. the Monorail"" (one of the most acclaimed episodes of the entire series) and ""A Streetcar Named Marge"" (with an outstanding performance by Jon Lovitz). The second volume contains the 1995 duet ""Who Shot Mr. Burns?"" which, while good, are the least satisfying episodes of the set. The last volume has ""Bart Gets Famous"" (a good look at show business) and Krusty Gets Kancelled (the fourth season finale, with lots of guest stars). The title of the set can be misleading: only three of the six episodes can be related to Hollywood (A Streetcar Named Marge, Bart Gets Famous and Krusty Gets Kancelled). The packaging isn't as good as the other sets'."
3,Good Video Idea Bad Episode Selection,"As a practicing Simpsons viewer I was interested by the idea of Simpsons episodes grouped by their context, but with the exception of ""A Streetcar Named Marge"",""Bart Gets Famous"", and ""Krusty Gets Kancelled"" the video has nothing to do with Hollywood. So if you're looking for a complete collection of star studded Simpsons prepare to be disappointed."
4,Australian Review Of The Simpsons,"The Simpsons in Hollywood is a light hearted look at how Matt Groening would draw Celebrities. This video contains some of todays brightest stars Alec Baldwin, Kim Basinger, Ron Howard, Bette Midler, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Johnny Carson. All are extremely funny and portrayed in the exact way we see them in real life. They all seem to fit into springfields way of life with ease and dignity. Top watch for all"
4,Hollywood,"This video pack is good for any Simpsons fan. On the first video is ""Marge vs. The Monorail"" in which Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) makes an appearance. The next episode is ""A Streetcar Named Marge"" where Marge stars in a musical version of ""A Streetcar Named Desire.""One the next video is ""Who Shot Mr. Burns"" parts 1 and 2.. The last video features ""Bart Gets Famous"" where Bart stumbles upon a famous catch line and appears on ""The Conan O'Brien Show."" The other episode ""Krusty Gets Kancelled"" is one of my favorites. In order of best to least it would go: 1. Krusty Gets Kancelled, 2. Marge Vs. The Monorail, 3. and 4. Who Shot Mr. Burns Parts 1 and 2, 5. A Streetcar Named Marge, 6. Bart Gets Famous"
2,Don't want to see it again,"It's a good pack. But once you see all 3 videos, you don't want to watch it again."
1,Shallow and repetitive,"Jean Marie Stine's book seemed very lazily thrown together. There were no samples of query letters, outlines, or book proposals included! There were only 3 pages discussing how to submit to an agent or publisher. I'm going to chuck this book and go back to ""How to Write Attention-Grabbing Query and Cover Letters"" by John Wood. There were no big big secrets revealed in Stine's book--the only good news is that it made me realize I already know what I have to do to publish my own self-help book, and I just have to go do it!"
5,I owe my book's success to this one...,Trully valuable resource foranyone looking to write a self-helpor a how-to book/ebook/report.Igor Kheifets[...]
1,LOL,Am I the only one who sees the severe irony in a self help book about writing self help books? I am going to use it to write a self help book about writing self help books about self help books...(note - all I read was the title)
2,not what I expected,"These are plastic-y, one cracked after 2nd washing, they look like the little fish bowls from the county fair, so big you have to use 2 hands to prevent sloshing it all over yourself :("
1,So fragile it's not worth it.,The glasses are so easy to break my set of six lasted 2 month.Good concept but extremely poor quality.
1,THIN & BREAKABLE,"They are VERY VERY FRAGILE!! I broke one just hand washing. I agree with previous comments, they will show finger prints, toasting is out of the question, and I wouldn't put them in the dishwasher. Beuatiful but not worth it."
2,Thin and brittle,"Cheers....not so fast!!! These glasses will shatter at first ""clink"". The glass is very thin and brittle and quite difficult to clean without breaking....don't even think of putting them into a dishwasher. Better go with more expensive brand. I will next time."
3,"Nice quality, but small!","I bought these for a friend and although she liked them, I was suprised at how small they were. The glass is nice and you can tell they are of good quality, but they are a little smaller than other stemless glasses I've seen."
2,"One of the three copies of Lu Hsun, Selected Stories came with a bent cover. I am very disappointed in the lack of care.","I have placed many book orders in the past and this is the first time that I am complaining that one of the three copies of Lu Hsun, Selected Stories arrived with a bent cover. I am disappointed and embarrassed to give this imperfect copy to a friend who asked me to order for her."
5,"Really beautiful song, equally good in Spanish & English.","I bought it after hearing it in Spanish on 93.1 radio. Wow, what a beautiful song. Kike Santander wrote the music and words, and then Gloria Estefan wrote the words in English -- which are great. Santander plays the guitar (really well) on the song behind Estefan singing. It's worth noting that the quality of the recording is great, too. The sound of the guitar is great. The sound of Gloria Estefan's voice is great. I don't own anything else by Gloria Estefan, but this song makes me want to buy Abriendo Puertas. Kike Santander wrote all the songs on the album, I think. This is actually the only music I know by Estefan, but this one song made me an instant fan."
5,AMAZING!!!,Anything Gloria does is great!!! This is a beautiful and passionate song!!! Great performance by Gloria!!!
4,Early Phish rocks.,"This is a great show. Rolling Stone called it the best Phish show ever, and I can see where they are coming from, but they're way off. THe best ever would either have to be 12/31/95 or 12/31/99 (the best livephish CD release would be 7). THis has many of the good jam tunes, but it's early in Phishtory, so this will let you see just where they have evolved from. The sound quality is OK, not great but it gets the job done. There is a considerable amount of humorous stage banter here, and some songs that they haven't done in quite a while.All in All, this is some great early Phish."
2,For $400 it should work better,"For the money, this grill should be sturdier and the flames should be even. I find the knobs to be somewhat rickety. My biggest complaint is the uneven burners. Mine do not burn as high in the front as the rear. In fact, you can get rare in the front and well done in the rear. Charbroil mentions this on their website as normal, but if you ask me it is a manufacturing defect and undesireable. I am actually considering selling it and purchasing a brand that consumer reports rated higher."
1,English Translation of German Book Is Horrible,"This book is horrible. Most of the graphs use the German or European standard for naming Metals so you have to do conversions to figure out their names in the English System. The paragraphs can be very confusing because of the translation, and it is usually best to just skip the first one or too and get into the meat of the chapter more. We had to purchase this book for my Bulk Sheet Metal Class at college and I always refer back to my Materials and Processes in Manufacturing by DeGarmo instead of trying to make heads or tails of this book. Don't buy unless you have too."
3,Nothing like TOOL but ....,"I first heard of TBE through a list on Amazon about other bands of interest for TOOL fans. ""Wow an unknown rock band similar to TOOL from Australia called TBE?!"" I thought with glee. I was crushed when I listened to it for the first time. What a disappointment! If you read all the TBE reviews on this site there's at least 10 references to TOOL and many to A Perfect Circle which they also don't sound like. On the other hand they are pretty good. You could very well hear them on an alternative rock station, nod your head, and tap the dashboard, but probably have no idea who they are. All of their songs could be radio hits. With a good music video, extensive marketing, and a well timed entrance into our saturated emo era they would go platinum easy. Their lead singer has great vocal range. TBE is a band worth checking out and I will hold on to their cd. However with all of that being said they're really nothing special and again nothing like TOOL."
5,A lovely wholesome movie for tween and teen girls,This is a lovely movie - with a good story and setting and without the junky stuff that is in a lot of movies for kids this age. We really enjoyed it and would recommend it especially for girls age 10-15.
4,Nice movie about New Zealand,"This is a nice movie in which one learns a lot about New Zealand culture. The protagonist is a likeable young girl and the Maori lady is a very interesting one. i found it under the Family film genre, and I'm not quite sure I'd put it under that category. While the protagonist is young there were a few of the more minor swear words in the movie, an underlying crush between the girl and her much older marching instructor, and a touch of idolatry in one scene. Admittedly, the film leaves one with a nice and pleasant feeling. But I'm not sure I'd watch it with impressionable youngsters."
5,A charming little movie.,I saw this movie at a festival and thoroughly enjoyed it. Very engaging. Very nice scenery. Good acting all around. Great for families.
5,A Great Film,"This is a great, great film. One of the best and most entertaining films I've ever seen. If you like fun, and a positive message, you will love this movie! I think it has something for everyone."
2,Thin gruel and weird speculation,"In this commentary, Dr. McGee too often simply reiterates Luke's text in his own words, adding little insight and some very unorthodox speculation. If you really want to learn something about Luke's Gospel in a reader-friendly format, choose the commentaries by William Barclay and Tom Wright."
3,Network Marketing Combined With New Age Philosophy,"The System has 3 key requirements.1. $1 a day2. Three companies3. Three partners to do the sameYou save $1 a day until you have enough to join a multi-level marketing program. You repeat this until you have joined three. You get your three partners to join them.Starting with ""3 recruits"" (authors words) you will have 364 recruits when your organization in 1 company is 5 levels deep. There's nothing new here.The philosophy applied to the process is new. It makes multi-level marketing palatable to the spiritually, environmentally and socially conscious. It sounded good to me.I personally have no interest in recruiting people or selling anything. I recomend ""Your Money or Your Life"" for Conscious wealth building."
5,An investment system of integrity-,"What a very valuable and exciting gift ""Financial Freedom On $1 A Day"" is! Suzanne Kirkland Kincaid has developed a model system of integrity that can help everyone realize financial independence. In this book Suzanne guides us through questions and answers, and with a simple step by step process- anyone and everyone can learn this practically no-risk investment system that creates a steady stream of income. I have been using this system for 16 months- it is truly achieveable! I encourage you to empower yourself by reading this book."
5,ultamite stadium,this stadium is sweet.this is a great stadium for powerful attack beyblades to move without hitting the walls as much.Its also good for more blades in the battle.Its better for practicing.p.s LET IT RIP.......................................
1,This is awful!!!,"Hasbro has really crossed the line this time. This is the worst stadium ever. THere is noo slope so attack types always go into pockets, and the bump in the middle screws up defense and endurence types too. I was able to break this stadium with the worst beyblade ever Wing Attacker, not to mention it broke after the second time I used it. This stadium is horrible. If your'e a serious beyblader STAY AWAY!!!"
1,Whats it look like?,I dont have this stadium but it makes me mad that they dont show a picture of it. I mean its a new item how do they expect us to order it if we dont even know what it looks like. and another thing this isnt the only thing they dont show pictures of half the beyblade things here. I hope the website sees this review so they mite do something about it!
5,Beystaidum,"the reson i had to give it 5 stars for every thing because, if you didnt have one you would have to battle in a tin,jar,box but the coolest thing you are not aloud to battle on would be the floor,with the rc tops.(remote control beyblades)O.K i will wite back soon BYE.From Ash"
4,enjoyable read for fans of Japanese culture,"Even if you find ""The Tale of Genji"" hard to read at times (I do, I admit) ""Shank's Mare"" is proof that not all old Japanese books are difficult for western readers to enjoy. It does help if you already have some understanding of the people and culture, but I think this title is proof that humor really can be a universal language. Broad, slap-sticky fun."
5,This is pure metal magic in anytime era....,"From the great great timing of the drums,Vinnie is pound for pound the best drummer on the planet.He is a true time michine that always blows my mind,everytime i hear him do his thing.Butler on bass is so good it would be sick to think anybodys better at his job.Iommi makes my hair stand up everytime he looks to the stars and smiles.He is the complete player who just leaves you breathless everytime you hear him plug in.Dio what can you say.He's the pure front man who makes every Heaven and Hell song come to life,When he lets loose there is nobody better on the mic.This Dvd Is like watching an opera of rock music.The music builds and draws you in time and time again.This is what heavy music should sound like and is expected from this very talented super group."
5,"Wow! I was a little unsure,for no good reason Obviously!","Absolutley smoking video! Why cant all bands do this after this long? Oh thats right their all Posers! Ozzy included! Masters of metal is the correct term for this band "" Black Sabbath"" Forget sharon and ozzy, this is the band that wants to And CAN play metal!!!"
4,THE REAL DEAL!!!,"When I heard about Heaven and Hell putting out a dvd,my first thought was ""I hope they don't embarass themselves like so many other bands who regroup after 10-20 years apart,it never sounds as good as the first time around"".As unbelievable as it may sound,Heaven and Hell are as good or better on this dvd than when they played the same stuff as Sabbath. Ronnie James Dio's vocals are fantastic and the rest of the band seem to realize this and give excellent performances themselves.This is no""nostalgia act"".This band and this concert is as good as anything out there from newer groups."
5,Black Sabbath with Dio.... need I say more??,Personally I think this is the best Black Sabbath line up and they don't miss a beat more than 25 years later!! I saw them Front Row in 1981 and it was a great show.... they are still rocking.... an amazing band!! A must have for any Sabbath or Dio fan!
5,dio,this is a awesome video. i caught there show in houston right before he passed away. i wanted some thing to remember that night so bought this concert video. purchased it in bluray format. super high quality and very good show.
4,Great Performance but what happened to the Bass on 5.1?,"I thought by now sound engineers would have figured out a standard method for producing the best 5.1 surround sound for concert DVDs. Well, whoever did this one screwed up what could have been a masterpiece. The bass on the LFE channel is practically non-existent, so you get almost no bass when listening to 5.1. The bass is better on the 2.1 setting, but you miss the surround experience. Also, what happened to the center channel? It is completely silent. The vocals should be coming out of that. The sound engineer on this disc needs to learn from the person who created the 5.1 on the Metallica S&M DVD."
1,Been there...done that..,"This is Sabbath's attempt to cash in on the RJD era by performing the Dio era classics as well as a couple of newer songs and calling the band Heaven and Hell to distinguish it from the Ozzy era. Only problem is, we've been there and done this before. Many, many times. Dio flashes the horns around, makes silly faces, he even reverts to part of the same corny ad lib in Heaven and Hell that he did on Live Evil. To their credit, Appice, Iommi and Butler do sound very good so I suppose it's more what you're into than anything. If you're a guitar guy then you will love this...drummers likewise cuz Appice is fun to watch...but if Dio annoys you, you better just skip this DVD."
2,Dont waste your money on this DVD,"I was really anticipating a good quality concert when I heard about the reforming of the Black Sabbath era with Ronnie at the vocals, unfortunatly I have to say I was very disappointed.The concert starts out with an opening song that was very low energy for an opening song, if you watch the audience even they all stood thier watching the opening with a boring sense of anticipation.Ronnie was off key in several of the songs, the timing was way too slow compared to the album versions of the songs.Tommy was off tune and out of time several times.They should have done more practicing before they caught this on film because none of the songs they did even compared to the blistering licks and pounding bass that you would hear from the original recordings.I was one of the fortunate people who actually saw these guys live back in the Heaven and Hell days and the new version is nowhere near the quality of the line up of yesterdays group.Could it be old age setting in?"
5,Turn up the Bass please!!!!!!,"The DVD is great, but the 5.1 mix should have been allot better!! This was recorder at the Radio City Music Hall, they have great accustics there!! The recording should be top quality!! I think they need to remix this DVD in DTS-ES and turn up the Bass!!!! This is Heavy Metal!!!!!"
5,Not as good as most Solace,"It took a while for this CD to grow on me. It's good, but not what I had grown to expect from Solace. The cover artwork is awesome. The music has trendy elements mixed with oriental and bellydance. There's a couple of songs on here that would be great for scary soundtracks."
4,Best Christmas gift my trumpet player could have had aside from a new trumpet,"My son has been asking for one of these for months, but I was uncertain if it would be worth the investment. It works well, and allows him to practice without disturbing his siblings, although this is just one of the features of this system. He'll now be able to practice when we're on holidays, and he was easily able to figure out all the features that this system has. It's not something to be used in daily practice, however, and you have to be careful to keep the volumem down."
5,Great for college dorm room,"I've had this for about 4 months now and during the school year it was amazing. I didn't have a lot of time to go to the practice hall, so in between classes and whenever I had a little time, I could just play in my room. It wasn't completely silent, so I would just turn up some music and no one could hear me playing. My room mate was even in the room sometimes while I played and she didn't mind at all. The back pressure is only an issue when I haven't been playing for awhile. Otherwise, I don't have a problem with pressure whatsoever. I would definitely recommend this for any brass player that can't always play in a place where they can be loud."
2,Quality Issues,"We've returned one of these units only to find that the replacement has the same issue with poor manufacturing quality. The 1/8"" jack on the body of the mute is loose. This creates a loud 'pop' through the line. If you're listening through headphones -- the whole point of this product -- you'll be treated to a painfully loud series of cracks and pops whenever the cord moves. The mute otherwise works as advertised."
4,Great item,"This was a Christmas gift for my son. He uses it daily and loves it! He has done some neat things with it including recording some of his own songs. Aside from that, the service from Amazon was excellent. Thanks !"
4,a very quiet trumpet mute,"There are two parts to this product, the mute itself with a microphone built in, and the electronics to amplify the microphone output. The mute is molded plastic with a foam rubber fitting. This grips the trumpet well and doesn't slip off. It fits my trumpet (King 600) quite well. Haven't measured how much quieter it is, but it does make a big difference.The electronics seem rather antiquated: 9V battery, loud pops when pluggin in, no power indicator. But it does sound OK.The electronics don't matter to me, I rarely use them. You might find the microphone and headphone cables awkward."
2,Too much back pressure.,"I bought the Yamaha SB79 Silent brass system because I live in an apartment building. I had not tried the product prior to buying it. Using the mute does make my cornet quiet enough to use in my apartment, however it creates a tremendous back pressure. This back pressure hurts my ears and gives me a headache. When using the earphones, the sound is unacceptble. It is advertised as creating Concert hall sound quality, but it only provides a tin like sound which is louder than the muted cornet."
4,"Overall, a great buy","I bought this product during my Freshman year of college, while I was living in the dorms for the first time. After getting it, it finally allowed me to practice in my room instead of having to find a practice room in some dank basement so I wouldn't disturb others. Although I haven't messed around too much with the effects processing, what I did use it for sounded very good, I'm just to lazy to plug it in. It works well with Jamey Aebersold play-a-longs, if you are into jazz.The only major problem I have with it is the backpressure, which as another review says, is more than advertised.Overall, I think the Yamaha Silent Brass Mute for Trumpet is a great buy for any trumpet player."
4,Silent Brass System,"Overall Yamaha's Silent Brass System is a great buy for anyone who has trouble with practicing due to roomates, neighbors, etc. I would say the mute eliminates all but about 5-15% of your sound (depending on how loud you are playing). Great for people with apartments, dorms, parents that just don't want to hear it, or even the musician who's selfconscious about their practicing (after all- who wants to hear a neverending pattern of lip slurs, techncal exercises, and slow repetition of that one part the player just can't quite get right??)There is a bit of resistance as some of the other reviewers have mentioned but I found that it actually strengthened my chops and improved my endurance. I would definitely recommend this product to other players."
5,You come to like this book,"When I first read this book, I wasn't getting into it. It was a while since I read the other two books, but as I read on I was hooked. The charactization was believable and likable. I loved how Scilla matured and enjoyed reading the scenes with her brother. It keeps in the same style as the other books (which I now own). A good book overall."
4,"Opinions, we all gotem, they all stink!","The only thing I would have liked to know is that the cover had a tear in it. Beyond that, it's a wonderful read, and I really am satisfied with the book. If you haven't read the first two in the Great Alta series, I suggest you do, before reading this. Many references to the other plots and situations faced.Ken."
2,A let-down,"I am a great fan of Jane Yolen's writing - including the Books of the Great Alta. I read Sister Light, Sister Dark several years ago and was lucky enough to find a used copy of White Jenna when it was out of print.I had high hopes for The One-Armed Queen, but I found it to be a major let-down. I guess that White Jenna really seemed like the end of the story to me - this book seems tacke onto the end. But aside from that, I just found it a little dull, and I had to force myself to keep reading. I've never had that experience with a Jane Yolen book before. Usually, I find her writing engrossing and I devour her books a few days after buying them.If you're a fan of the Great Alta books, you might as well pick up The One-Armed Queen - but don't go into it with high expectations."
3,A good read but....2 was enough.,"I agree with the previous reviewers. The first two books of the Great Alta series have a more mystic/bardic quality whereas the third seems to be somewhat dryer and 'historical'. I also felt that the story didn't really tie into 'letters to the editors', legend and myth sections of the book, or, if it did, I missed it.I also don't remember the first two books [although violent in parts, there was a war afterall] being so gory...and for what purpose? Some of the descriptions [I'm being intentionally vague for those who have yet to read it] were very vivid, and yet didn't further the plot lines.Make no mistake, I am a great Jane Yolen fan and am always questing for her books and short stories. [Check out 'The Stone Fey'. Listed as a children's book but with some wonderfully subtle adult themes.] I guess the Great Alta books are a hard act to follow."
3,One Armed Queen,"This was a disapointment after the first 2 books, not that it wasn't a good book though. It was about Queen Jenna's adopted daughter, Scilia, and her struggle to gain back the Kingdom from her brother Jem, who was send to the Garuns, and game back a brutal man who over threw the castle, if you liked the first 2, you may want to read it, but as I said, it was a bit of a disapointment after the first 2 in the series."
2,Not so good...,"I read White Jenna and Sister Light, Sister Dark and I loved those two. But this book just doesn't meet those standards. It was ok. I liked it because I found how the rest of the story went, but it just didn't seem to catch me. She only really developed the girl (i forget her name) that Jenna had adopted. I think you should read this book just to find how the story ends, but that's the only reason."
2,Cheaply made,"Price was good, Delivery Timely. That said: I ordered 2 and one of them was not working within a week,I could hear the caller, but the caller could not hear me. This product does not have the same quality build as the original. We are not talking blue tooth here, this is a wired device, it should work, period! I still have my original and works great."
3,worked for a while,"The cord on the earbud was a little short, and the wire was pretty light weight. It worked great and sounded great for about 3 weeks, then the dredded short in the cord found this headset in the trash. I must admit I am hard on cords. The answer/end button is handy."
3,Mediocre product,"Not what I expected, I thought I would get better audio and mic quality, but what did I expected if it was so cheap... I got what I paid for.If your not looking to spend to much money and don't care about the quality... this is for you!=0)"
4,Classic Rene and Angela,"Could be better but not bad either. Missing some songs like Angel and Your Smile, but if you're a Rene and Angela fan, it's worth a listen."
3,Alien almost there,"One of my hobbies is to search for past material that I did not purchase or discover in my earlier years as a musician. At 40 i still enjoy quality melodic pop rock, my favourite being good driving big stadium rock sounds of the 80's mainly. Well Alien I heard initially off the Blob soundtrack in the 80's - we watched it again recently(June 2008) for a hoot and I chased this cd to buy.It is one of those bands that are almost there but not quite. However, the standout is Brave new love. The vocals, RIFFS and harmonies deliver nicely but half the tracks would be in my opinion 'incomplete'. Half the tracks are definitely listenable but Alien is only a shadow of the likes of Jovi,Giant and Def Leppard."
2,"GREAT STORY, SHODDY PRINTING/BINDING","This is an inspiring story about one of the TRUE heroes of the United States, honored (much too late) both at home and abroad. That being said, Bantam Books should be ASHAMED of the absolutely SHODDY, INFERIOR quality of this paperback edition! When I opened my NEW copy, the first page in the photograph section fell out, which led me to look more closely at that section. The pictures are so poorly reproduced that many, if not most, of them are barely recognizable as photographs! Bantam Books has given this Great American Hero, Mr. Vernon J. Baker, the same disgraceful treatment that the U.S. Army gave him for so many years. Reprehensible and unconscionable!"
5,"``Lasting Valor'' an amazing story, told with amazing skill","``Lasting Valor'' is not only a superb war story, it is a superb life story. With this book, Vernon Baker and Ken Olsen have handed us a piece of history many of us never knew existed - and they have done so with captivating skill. A tightly told story, ``Lasting Valor'' doesn't bog down with the minutiae of war, but instead gives us a closer look at and a better understanding of the human drama that was World War II and its aftermath. From his life growing up in Wyoming to his time spent in Italy and his years in North Idaho, Vernon Baker allows us to see him as a human being and not just a war hero. He also gives us a vivid and honest tour through America's horrendous history of bigotry. It's a refreshing perspective and one we're all better for receiving."
4,A compelling read,"Without gushing unnecessarily, this is a hell of a book. It's full of rich details that etch vivid images -- from life in rural Wyoming to bloody combat -- and also has a quiet irony and humor that take some of the bitterness out of Baker's tale. A really readable book; not something you read because you should, but because Baker and his story capture you and make you want to find out what happened next. A good read."
5,Should be required reading for high school history students!,"Vernon Baker and Ken Olsen have done a tremendous job of telling the story of Baker's heroic deeds in Italy during WWII. Compelling reading for anyone interested in history, race, and the U.S. Armed Forces in Europe. Baker's humble acceptance of the Medal of Honor in January 1997 (after 55 years) touched me deeply. The book amplified what I felt to be true--Vernon Baker was a leader of men and served his country well in the face of blatant discrimination. Buy this book!!"
4,"Great addition to ""stuff we should have been taught.""","A timely book that adds to current discussions about race. Like the story of La Amistad, Vernon Baker's story is one that should have been heard by a lot more people a lot sooner. Baker and Olsen make us understand what it was like to be a black soldier in a white man's army and just as importantly, the unglamorous difficulties of being a soldier in often no-win situations.The story weaves between taught World War II battle scenes to growing up in small-town Wyoming. If you like stories about real people of character who unflinchingly tell a tale, you will like this book. It adds yet another refreshing perspective not only to the race discussion, but the realities of war.<B>"
3,This Novel Doesn't Work Very Well,"This novel is a very atypical Wodehouse undertaking, and it's a lucky thing, because ""The Coming of Bill"" is not particularly successful. Wodehouse departs from his usual cast of zanies to embrace a couple of fairly straight (i.e., non-misanthrophic) characters (Kirk and his wife Ruth), who are not entertaining in the usual Wodehouse way. The greatest flaw in the novel is the voice of Bill himself. P.G.W. simply cannot capture a child's voice, and what reader of Wodehouse wants to listen to a child speak anyway? The plot, at least with regard to Ruth, is completely unbelievable, which doesn't matter in the usual Wodehouse fare, because nothing ever comes close to being believable, but here it does matter and makes ""Bill"" an unsatisfactory read."
4,Still Fun!,"P.G. Wodehouse has long been a favorite of mine, and I found this book to be a wry delight. No Jeeves in this one, but still fun."
1,Not very bright and proud of it.,"I'm pretty easy going until you go out of your way to insult me. I have a sailboat and over 100 books on sailing; how to, historical, anecdotal, and horrible. This one is the worst. There is nothing in this book that you cannot find in dozens of places. The author is condescending, obnoxious, arrogant, and boasts of his contempt for editing (bee fourwarnd). He seems to think he has the inside track on this troubled world and would like us to finance his mediocrity and self-indulgence with the purchase of this tripe. He claims to be an off-the-grid kind of guy; as do most hucksters."
2,Gimme a break!,"This book is self-published because no real publisher would put up with the rambling whining the author indulges in. For every valuable tip, there are 10 pages of ""philosophy"" that few others will care to read. I wouldn't mind getting my $24 back."
3,Leicester Bangs Review (1997):,"Paul K & The Weathermen - Love Is A Gas (Alias)""Love Is A Gas"", Paul K's eighth album, is always an interesting listen. Produced by Mo Tucker, the songs are more accessible than usual, though style wise we go from the phrasing of Townes Van Zandt to the song structure of UK Decay via the pop sensibilities of Matthew Sweet and Stevie Wonder. The latter comes courtesy of a cover of ""Jesus Children Of America"".Paul K pretty much wears his heart on his sleeve. His experiences of drug addiction and life on the streets regularly come through in his lyrics, though they don't drag the music down. ""Love Is A Gas"" is a good introduction to the work of Paul K."
5,A MUST HAVE in any record collection,"A grand mix of intelligent well thought out lyrics, and tight, complete music. It is very theraputic, and can be played loud!"
1,"""Hey Carson!""","If a band that that combines the worst elements of Matchbox 20 and recent Blink 182 sounds like your cup of tea, then these guys are for you."
1,Outdated,This book was outdated when i bought it years ago. Whats worth noting though is that the newer edition was the same book only with the pages having been shifted around so that your assignments wouldn't line up. They probably keep recycling the exact same stuff into new editions each year to sell new books.
1,Any teacher who chooses this text...,"is a complete moron. This text is SO poorly organized and poorly written that students have absolutely no clue come test time. There is a great deal of time spent on examples, but the examples are never explained. If you're asked why or how on a test, you'd be sunk. If your teacher requires this text for your stats class, find a different class!"
3,Drowning in character development,"Though the character development is an improvement over Lost Souls, I feel like Brite went into overkill mode on this one. We get to learn every iota of detail about the lives of the two main characters - scratch that, about their personal histories.. for we never really find out what sort of digital crime was committed by Zach, or what Trevor's day to day life was like - that the real plot didn't seem to kick in until I was already half-way through the book. It wasn't as action-packed as Lost Souls, and more 'romantic' than Exquisite Corpse, but it was still worth reading if only to get the cameos in the other novels, read some interesting relationship bonding, learn more about Missing Mile, and celebrate Brite's talent for the spooky and delightfully queer."
2,Ambitious attempt....but failed to deliver,"The enjoyment factor of this book was quite low for me. I am not quite sure if me failing to enjoy this book was due to the style, the story-line, or just the characters, but something was definitely missing. The novel had a rather sterile feel to it--no beauty and poetry, just ""blunt trauma."" Such a style can used in an effective way, but in this novel it just ""didn't do it."" I was truly expecting something more from this book, mostly because of numerous positive comments I have heard in regards to the author's work. Perhaps I should give her another chance and read her newest novel--not even the greatest novelist can produce outstanding works all the time. Or maybe I will just give her another ten years to improve."
5,"Complex and just really, really good.","I really enjoyed this book. Zach and Trevor were like old friends by the time it ended, incredibly complex and REAL. Brite's work is wonderful, her images visceral. Her stories hit you straight in the gut, and make it seem as if you're really there. I liked this one better than Lost Souls. Read it!"
2,this book does not reflect brite's talent,"this book doesn't start out well with the inner monologues of a 5 year old who sounds 30. yet, because i liked brite's previous novel, lost souls, so well, i hung on and trudged through. unlike the developed characters and plot in her first novel, drawing blood is a grave disappointment. its mainly lots of sex scenes, domestic violence, and drugs. there is no real story to draw the reader in. its not a book i would reccomend to others. with talent such as brite's, i was very disappointed to see her name on this one."
3,A collection of short horror stories,"This was definitely not as good as Poppy's first book Lost Souls. This book is a collection of short horror stories. I found that although a few stories were great such as, ""His mouth will taste of Wormwood"", and, ""The sixth sentinel""; that others just did not hold my attention. Poppy is no doubt one of the best horror authors of her time, and I am among her true following, however this book did not do her justice."
5,Does it get any better than this?,"I have been a fan of Poppy Z. Brite since I first read Drawing Blood about a year and a half ago. I have read all of Brite's other works since, and although I love them all, none compare to Drawing Blood. I can honestly say that I've re-read this book over twenty times, and I get more out of it every time. Brite's style is surrealistic and believable, her prose flowing and intoxicating, her plot heart-breakingly beautiful and intriguing. Brite's union of a love story and a horror story is so perfectly matched that there is no seperation between these two focuses of the plot, and I have never read a book that could evoke so much emotion in me without seeming as if evoking emotion was the point of the book. Basically, anything that comes close just seems like it's trying too hard."
3,Kind of depressing.....,"This is just so totally different then what I'd expected. I'd read the reviews others had written and couldn't wait to read it.I went to the bookstore and bought the book and it turns out to be not what I'd expected from what I'd read the reviews of other Drawing Blood readers. It was a really dark fic and nearly every single fact inside was unhealthy, such as smoking, drugs, violence, etc. Personally I regretted buying this book. But well, maybe some readers who love dark fics would probably love this, so for those of you who are, go get it. When I'd finished reading this book, I had this really uncomfortable feeling in my heart and couldn't really sleep well that night. It just disturbs me."
5,This needs to be a movie; with no changes!,"I just finished reading this novel and it was exquisitely fantastic. It made me want to live the book. I will forever more be obsessed with this novel. I would absolutely love to see this in the theatre, but details would probably be changed and graphic content taken out so I guess i'll have to be content with the book. I've also read 'Exquisite Corpse,' which was also great, but I liked 'Drawing Blood' more. Keep writing Poppy; I'll never read Steven King again."
5,GREAT BOOK,I love this book. I think that you too will love it. It is a book that once picked up you won't put down.
2,Not a Horror Novel,"Although the book is fairly well-written, it certainly is not a good thriller or horror novel. There is very little suspense in the whole book. For the most part, the book is a rather boring character development."
2,boring,"simple minded story just never takes flight. Homo-erotic sequences have all been done better and many times before. It's basically ""The Shinning"" minus the shine, with some characters stolen from the film ""My Own Private Idaho"" thrown in for good measure. I was really hoping for more."
4,hoo boy...,"this book is the story of two men, both trying to escape their lives in different ways. neither have ever loved before, until they meet each other. trevor is a confused man who was orphaned at age five by his father, who murdered trevor's mother and brother, then commited suicide. zach is on the run from the law for computer hacking. they meet up in missing mile, north carolina, and together try to solve the mystery that has been plaguing trevor all his life: why is he alive?"
4,darkly decadent,"In _Drawing Blood_, Poppy Z. Brite has produced a thoroughly modern haunted house story infused throughout with her signature blend of heady homoeroticism, drugs, and music. On the way, Brite neatly captures a slice of current horror- and cyberculture through her recognition of artists ranging from Bosch, Giger, and Lovecraft to Gibson and Sterling. Recommended for those who would enjoy a more darkly decadent Anne Rice mixed with a liberal amount of Stephen King's ghoulishness"
2,A little too much...,"I'll keep this review short...i can't say it was a bad novel, but it just seemed to me as if Brite was trying too hard to be sub/counter-culture...it read more like a young adult, R.L. Stine novel with lots of weed smoke and gay sex..."
2,A very long book.,"I started this book in early October. I was in the mood for a good dose of horror and the reviewer at my local bookstore said it was so frightening and evil she had to throw it across the room to get away from it. Now that sounds like quite a read! The reality wasn't quite so exciting and here I am a month later. It soon became very long and drawn out with minimal horror. I was compelled to put the book down, but hardly to throw it across the room for it's evil attributes.Brite is an interesting writer and I might even give her a try again but this book just seemed to take forever to get any place. Her characters were intense and appealing. The story line was tedious but unusual. I would give this book a 2.5 on a good day. Kelsana 11/14/01"
5,An Amazing Dive Into The Human Soul,"Drawing Blood is an amazing dive into the human soul. It's as if Poppy z Brite looked into the souls of two young men, and wrote what she saw on paper. This books was hauntingly rich, and darkly disturbing. The characters were built so well, i felt like I actually knew them. Anyone who does not like this bokk, did not read it. Praise to Poppy z. Brite!!"
2,mediocre,"When I first read this book some time back I found it original, chilling and a tight piece of work. Coming back to it now I can't help but find it rather tedious and at times naive. The storyline itself isn't the problem, it is the way Brite narrates that makes me cringe. Obviously fans of the book, and Brite as a writer, are not going to agree with me on the next point but I find she relies on stereotypes far too much and her characters, although displaying some degree of depth, are quite two dimensional. The love scenes between Zach and Trevor are particuarly excrutiating. The narration here is juvenile and it almost seems as if she is rushing to make a point and move on to the next scene as if she is reading the text not writing it. The scenes are not well crafted and this is the feeling I got from the novel as a whole. To me it feels like a novel written by a randy teenager who has no idea how to craft a three dimensional story and has drawn from every stereotype available."
4,"Fun, but...","If you want to introduce an easily offended friend to the twisted world of Poppy Z. Brite this is the book to use. A Horror Romance about Goth boys in love the atmosphere grabs you by the throat and the story when it's going is going at a breakneck pace. However sometimes the homoerotic, while beautifully done is excessive. I'm told that Jean Auel's Clan of the Cave Bear series fell into five hundred page sex in the cave adventures. This is the only trap this book falls into. Still it is a fun book and the characters are more fleshed out than the Lost Souls bunch"
2,One Touch Peronal Roll On Waxer,"The product I got was defective and I am in the process of returning it. I am a long-time fan of One Touch and have been using the personal roll on waxers for close to 30 years. My 10 year old one works fine still, I just thought I'd get a back up in case the old one broke. Unfortunately the new one did not get hot enough at all and I have to return it."
3,This is fiction.,"If you are looking for another ""Andreason Affair"" type investigation, be warned; this is a work of fiction. I purchased this book thinking it was an investigation into UFO's, and was a bit upset to find that it isn't. Fowler gets his ideas from his UFO investigation work and spins them together to tell this tale of part UFO/ part Second Coming. If you find these ideas interesting, then this book will be just enough to hold your attention. Unfortunately it isn't very well written. Fowler obviously doesn't write prose very often. His dialogue was especially poor. Overall it was... fine."
3,Enjoyable Louis L'Amour based Western,"This is a well made 1960's Western based on the earlier 1953 John Wayne film. Ralph Taeger does very well as the laconic scout entrusted as peace emissary to the Apaches by General Crook. The film is compiled from episodes of the short lived TV series but the continuity is fine apart the odd piece of abrupt editing. In some ways this version of the Louis L'Amour novel is more enjoyable than the earlier classic film in that the Native Americans are more sympathetically treated, and there is a good supporting cast including Noah Beery jr and Kathie Browne, with guest appearances from Robert Taylor and Michael Rennie.The action moves along nicely to a rousing climatic battle with renegade Apaches and a satisfyingly upbeat ending.For animal lovers Hondo's dog Sam survives in this version! Recommended."
4,Not for the casual reader,"I picked up this book because of its compelling thesis about the shifting meaning of slavery in history. Unfortunately, I got about 1/6th of the way through it and I realized that it is a bit more scholarly than what I had imagined. I would not recommend it unless you either already have a fairly solid foundation in European and world history, or you are willing to put in the effort to acquire it while plodding through this book. The audience for this book is obviously other academic historians and advanced students thereof, not the general public."
5,excellent soap what damage????,The product shipped in good condition and the scent was divine. As for the damage it was negligible. The soap is an excellent buy and I plan to go back and get more if it is still available. The only negative is the high shipping and handling but when you put it together with the cost of the soap it even out.If you enjoy good soap with a rich perfumed lather you can not go wrong with this purchase.
3,Harder than it sounds....,"I would enjoy this game better if I could get past certain levels; very frustrating. I like the characters on it, but that's as far as it goes. A very frustrating game. I do not have enough patience for it! I play plenty of games, but this one is way more difficult and aggrevating than I can tolerate!"
4,I like it,"The positive: I read the other reviews and I'm not sure if I like the recipes because I haven't really had vegetarian food before. I got this book because it was required in a college course. Sounds weird, I know, but it served a purpose. I've tried quite a few things from this book and I found a lot of recipes that I liked. As a final project in my class I made a variety of dishes and took them to class and the class really liked it too. I liked this book so much that when it was lost in a fire I ordered a new one!The negative: some of the recipes are time consuming and I do like a larger variety of spices, but I guess with this being a Sivananda book, some spices just are not used for specific reason."
2,great pictures! bad recipes :(,"i really wanted to love this book. the pictures of the dishes throughout the book are amazing. this book does have some great info on yogic diet and fasting, but as i made a number of the dishes in this book i wondered if they really tested them out. the directions sometimes seem to leave out steps and/or ingredients, which makes it hard to follow. maybe i've just been unlucky with the recipes i've chosen over the last 6 months, but the what i've made from this book has not turned out (and i'm not a novice cook). it really is too bad that the recipes don't live up to the picture that go along with them."
2,"Recipes are not great - missing steps, incorrect portions, etc","I 100% agree with the last reviewer. I really REALLY wanted to like this book and to use it everyday. I have had nothing but problems trying to cook with this book. The steps are incredibly vauge, the amount for any particular ingrediant is out of proportion. I'm writing this review after attempting the banana-nut tart on pg 108. First of all, the amount of left-over mix for the crust is unbelievable - I could have cut the amount of ingrediants in half. There is no binder, so the whole thing fell apart. And the filling is just the same! I am a very experienced baker and cook, and I am so frustrated that this isn't working out! The pictures are gorgeous, and the information on diet is very helpful, but overall it is not worth your money. Sorry!"
3,The Yoga Cook Book,"I bought this book twice because I lost my first copy. This book is worth it's money just for one recepie and that is the tofu prune cake. Soooooooo delicious!!!!!!!!!! Most bevarages and breakfasts are also delicious. But some of the soups and entries are rather bland (no onions, no garlic) or work with ingrediant combinations (ginger) I don't care for to much.If like to eat fresh food and don't like to use any caned or otherwise processed foods and need to be very careful with your food choices and don't eat meat - this book is for you.This book does offer vegan choices is however based on a lacto-vegetarian diet."
2,Don't Try The Ginger Bread,"I was thrilled to read this book, and came close to recommending it to a friend, but then I tried the ginger bread. I had to throw the whole thing out after wasting all those ingredients and my time. It is too bad. There are some useful charts, and the book is beautiful, friendly and nicely written. Unfortunately these recipes were not tested."
3,Only for Diehard Izzi Fans,"The two editorial reviews say it all.Although there are some great scenes in this book, the plot seems like it is culled from a bad telenova show. The protagonist is neither likable nor believable.There are so many great Eugene Izzi books that it is almost a shame this one was published. If you haven't read 'Invasions' or 'Prowlers', pass this one up and go directly to them. You will be rewarded."
3,Mediocore,"This book was all right but in the end really didn't deliver. Very little insight was really offered, everything seemed to be based on the show, or other information which was eaisly accesible. I't wasnt terrible or anything, just probably not worth the time or money. I love the Survivor series too, so I should be biased towards the book but it ends up just being really bland. Also there were many grammatical mistakes in my copy of the book, which slightly distracted as well. I wouldn't recommend this unless you are a die-hard Survivor fan."
2,Eagerly anticipated but disapointing,"I was disapointed in the book Survivor by Mark Burnett and Martin Dugard. I was hoping for more behind the scenes information and photographs, but the book, I felt was a melodramatic journal recapping the 39 days with very little new information or photographs. I would like to have had more insight on the selection process and much more behind the scenes information and photos. I enjoyed the show, Survivor, watched all the episodes, and read newspaper and magazine articles printed during the telecast, so very little of what was in the book, Survivor was new to me."
2,Wait for Round Two,"Mark Burnett deserves an Emmy for importing ""Survivor"" to American household televisions during an otherwise listless summer of(yawn)re-runs. Action, suspense, and deception ran as rampant as the rats on Pulua Tiga each week. Therefore, I was extremely disappointed after reading Mr. Burnett's book. If you've seen the show then you'll find a lot of detail and background lacking. If you didn't catch ""Survivor the first or second go-round then you'll be left wondering what all the fuss was about. My advice. Save your money, pass on this book and wait for Survivor II - The Australian Outback to premiere after the Super Bowl."
2,"T.V SERIES was AWSOME, but this BOOK was DISAPPOINTING!","For the most part, this book re-hashed what we saw on the T.V. series of SURVIVOR. I was disappointed in the lack of off-screen details of what occurred with the Survivor cast. I found the book to contradict what I saw on the T.V. series a few times, making me wonder which one really happened. The few photos in the book added very little to the book, and many of the pictures seemed out of place for the chapters they were in. Surely not the book to read if you've never seen the T.V. Series, however, as a Survivor fanatic, I did find out a few tidbits of interesting information about the show. Only wish the book had provided even more."
2,Misses the mark!,This book is a pale comparison to the well done tv show. It seemed rushed and was not a very good look at the dynamics of the tv show and it's personalities. I'd suggest fans of the show skip this book and enjoy the the t.v. version.I hope that the Survivor contestants can write their own books asap as the show is now a part of broadcast legend and their views would be very impactful on this show's place in television history. The book doesn't accomplish this at all.
2,An interesting companion book,"Right on the cover, it states Offical Companion Book of the Television Series....and it is an interesting addition. having watched all the series (I know, I should be professing to watch only PBS, not schlock) I found this book added to an already enjoyable experience. Most interesting to me was all the background of the actual production aspect of the show. I would have liked more information on the production crew...what kind of person signs up for that? The book also would have benefited from rewriting. It was written as the events unfolded...fleshing out the facts would have been a huge plus. In the end it does what it says it will....it is an addition to the series."
2,"T.V AWSOME, but this BOOK was DISAPPOINTING!","For the most part, this book re-hashed what we saw on the T.V. series of SURVIVOR. I was disappointed in the lack of off-screen details of what occurred with the Survivor cast.

Series, however, as a Survivor fanatic, I did find out a few tidbits of interesting information about the show. Only wish the book had provided even more."
3,THE FIRST SEASON...,"This book takes a look at the first season of the hit series, ""Survivor"". Essentially, it is a companion book that would probably only be of interest to those who watched the first season. It provides a behind the scenes look at the creation of the show, as well as some interesting revelations about the host and the contestants.The book includes a number of black and white photographs, none of which are captioned. So, readers, even those who were fans of the first season, may find themselves unsure as to who or what was photographed. Why this was done this way is beyond me, as it makes no sense, especially as the book is touted as the official companion book to the show. Then again, the whole book has a feeling of being hastily put together.If one was a fan of the first season, as I was, or is simply a hard core survivor fan, I can see reading this book and enjoying it somewhat. If one is not, I would say, don't bother."
3,Add A Star If You Are A Survivor Addict,"I found this book to be a very entertaining and quick read. It of course helps to be a fan of the show and if you consider yourself a Survivor addict this book is a must-read. My main complaint is the price. For the amount of money they are charging for a trade paperback, you should get more book. Maybe Mark Burnett would have been better served, if he had taken his time and done a better book, instead of trying to cash in quickly. I know there has to be a fear of Survivor's fifteen minutes of fame running out, but I do think that a more detailed book would have been more succesful."
1,Who is supposed to read this book?,"Anyone who followed the series will find it incomplete, inaccurate, and boring. Many key elements were given short shrift or not covered at all. The analysis of the personality of the players is at the level of astrology.Anyone who did not follow the series will not find out much about it here. Who are these people whose pictures appear in the book? No captions and no clues by placement. Much too little.The book ends:""For those of you wondering: every word of this book has been written on Pulau Tiga, as events occurred. Nothing has been added or deleted in hindsight, ...""If this had been in the beginning of the book, I could have taken fair warning and not wasted time reading it."
2,"Okay read, but with little insight.","I picked up this book hoping to get a different view of my favorite TV show -- in fact, that only TV show I watched for a great while). However, I was disappointed to find that Burnett was -- admittedly, somewhat predictably -- more interested in the trials and tribulations of the crew than in the developing relationships of the characters. The castaways are given a single descriptor that serves them throughout the entire book (Rudy: grump. Susan: redneck. Richard: gay.), and are hardly developed. Where on the TV show the characters were interesting and three-dimensional, on the page they are flat and boring. The book is littered with anecdotes from crew life, that, while interesting, hardly develop the story of the castaways. Perhaps the book would be a bit more enlightening with more emphasis on the character relationships; after all, this is supposed to be a book about the SURVIVORS. Isn't it?"
4,A fascinating behind-the-scenes look at Survivor.,"When I bought this book, I was expecting a more glowing, fluffy piece of show promotion than I got. The writing is actually fairly complex, and the book is structured more as a chronicle of life on the island than most books of this nature usually are. This book seems clearly designed to be a companion to the show, not a replacement for it--you can't get everything from this book that you could watching the show. But that's what makes this book so interesting--it's the story of life on the island from the offscreen point of view, which is often every bit as exciting and interesting as what happened on the island. While there were a few typos, and the few photos there were weren't captioned, if you enjoyed the TV series, you need to read this book so you can understand how the show's crew--equally as important as the castaways--perceived their 39 days on Pulau Tiga."
2,Boring novelization with little inside info,"Burnett seems more obsessed with psychoanalyzing Greg (the only reason Buis acts up, Mr Burnett assures us, is because he's an insecure boy inside). Very little insight or unknown info (Sonja's lesbianism is not even alluded to, why Burnett chose Jenna and Sean to be ambassadors over the castaways' choices). The only revealing info is about Kelly's duplicitousness, but when Susan's speech is misquoted, bizarrely."
4,"Survivor, the inside dirt.","This book provide the diehard Survivor fan with an inside view into the world of Survivor. The book covers many elements of the production of the show as well as behind the scenes information on the Tagi and Pagong tribes members. Many readers will be surprised on the many revelations including the real dirt on the true facts about the Pagong tribe and why they didn't really get along. While the book covers these elements well, it provides little detail about the challenges and other events already covered in the television show. What it does best, is offer a look into the minds and thoughts of the cast and crew of this summers biggest hit show."
2,Have You All Got Amnesia??,"I'm not sure if anyone could have been anticipating the release of this book more than myself. Known around the office as ""survivor.com,"" I couldn't wait to take my preoccupation to a new level. At first I was very entertained, but as some of my favorite scenes from the show were recounted, I found myself leaping from my reading chair, sounding frighteningly similar to Kathy Bates from Misery, shouting, ""What's the matter with you people? Have you all got amnesia?? That's not what happened!"" Misquotes were discouraging to me, and the ""dozens of photos"" were a bit of a disappointment. I'll still love the book, just because of its' association with the most significant television event in my life. I just thought potential readers should ensure they've seen the real (at least in my world), more entertaining story on television."
3,"Burnett...GENIUS as producer, average at best as a writer.","At times written in a strange 'novel style' that I'm guessing was due to the contribution of co-writer Dugard. A LOT of details are skimmed over here, or not touched on at all. And for some weird reason, he refers to host Jeff Probst almost exclusively as 'Chief Jeff' through most of the book. A quick read, and a must for fans of the show. But it makes me wish that the cast didn't have a (rumoured) THREE YEAR gag order preventing them from giving us the real story. WARNING: Cringe-inducing description of Richard Hatch's sexual fantasies about one of his fellow Tagi members. Congrats Mark on a great show...plenty of time for you to improve for your NEXT companion guide. ;^)"
1,Rushed to cash in on the Survivor craze,"Here was a chance to get to read about what went on that didnt make the air but Burnett blew it. The book is a quick read so i would say you should probably read it at your local bookstore instead of buying it because if you are a fan of the show, like me, then you will be disappointed by the lack of depth to island life. It seemed to me that they rushed this book because they know that many of the fans would want to read a behind the scenes book, too bad they didnt take time to proofread it because the spelling errors stand out. Hope they dont rush Survivor 2 like they rushed this book. The one thing that was nice about it was that you could read alittle more background on your favorite castaway, in my case SUE!!"
3,Rushed to print,"As much as I enjoyed Survivor I did think that the book was just a bit took much -- especially right after the show. There are many factual errors based upon what was shown on TV and many typos (most notably when referencing the final tribal council where Richard Hatch was awarded the million dollar prize, Burnett wrote that Susan Hawk was preparing a speech where she compared Richard to a snake and Susan to a rat. Kelly was the one she referred to as a rat in her speech.). Although the book is highly informative and gives a new insight into the show, you can tell that Burnett did have an affinity for some of the cast members and a not-so-cheery attitude about others. In describing Stacey Stillman's exit from the game, he portrays her, pretty much, as an obnoxious brat.It's not the greatest thing since sliced bread but it will give you a new dimension in which to enjoy the game."
2,A Must Read Only For Survivor Addicts,"However it needs to be at least 500 pages long to cover what I wanted to know. I read this book in 7 hours. The show lasted 14. And most of the book covers what one learns from the show.I've got to agree with others about the awful (perhaps non-existant) editing job and lack of pictures. For photos, visit the CBS website. But if you gotta know everything you can about this show, you gotta buy this book (and wait for the ""gag"" on the Survivor cast to elapse)."
2,Yawn...tell me something new,"As a huge Survivor fan I was looking for some new and fresh information about what went on behind the scenes of the show, what the producers thought about all the media hype during the show, and maybe some real insight into the contestants that we didn't get on CBS. Instead it's as if Mark Burnett just sat down, watched the show, and wrote a recap. Bleh."
2,Why bother?,"As a big Survivor fan I eagerly anticipated reading this book and bought it as soon as it hit the stores. I was sure I would read it all in one sitting but it took me a week or so to trudge through it. I expected to find out all the inside scoop on what went on when we wern't looking. You know, all the ""dirty little secrets"". Unfortunately these insights were few and far between. The book was more or less exactly what you saw on the show. I had seen every episode so I really didn't get much from the book. This book fell way short of my expectations and I feel it was a waste of money."
2,Bah!!!,"OK, for the record it is a semi-decent guide to what happened on the island.That being said, the editing is HORRIBLE. Betweens calls of Susan Hatch (?!?) Kelley and Sean's job as a Neurosurgeon (thought he was a Nurologist) the innaccuracies and misspellings will pretty much ruin it."
2,what do you expect from a quickie book,"This is apparently a quickie book, timed to keep interest alive until Suvivor II starts. The book has some interesting information about what really happened, but it is still from Mark Burnett's point of view. As the show's producer, he feels qualified to tell us what really went on in the minds of the contestants, but to me it sounds like psychobabble. What I find most annoying is his lamenting about how the good people did not do well, and the bad people triumped. Give me a break. This is mostly a game of political strategy, and Burnett designed the game. Extremely disingenious of Mr. Burnett, and I wish I had not purchased this slop filled book."
5,A difficult book for a difficult time,"This book may seem a bit inaccessible at first, but rewards those willing to spend time with it. The images are of forests, mostly in Oregon, close to the place Bob Adams has made home for the last decade. In this landscape, Adams finds elements that resonate both with the past and the present, celebrating what remains, but also showing very clearly the damage done. The most savage pictures are those of clear cuts, where the stumps of the virgin forests still remain, but the effect seems more to be from war rather than commerce. These images are all the more striking when we consider the images we have not seen from our recent history."
5,TURNING BACK,Robert Adams is a significant American Photographer. Adam's photographs and this book are a reminder how much of our natural world has been destroyed by the greed of the forest industry in the Pacific Northwest. Adams has shown devastation inflicted on the landscape as Mathew Brady showed Civil War battlefields. This book goes further and is a superb book to own.
2,Disappointing,"Although I have enjoyed Robert Adams earlier work, I am having difficulty seeing the photographic merit of this current project.If one reads the text with the explanation that Adams is attempting to show some of the destruction of the wilderness caused by a man in the areas that were explored by Lewis and Clark, then there is a context and a meaning to be had. But if you look at the photographs on their own, without any explanation of the intent of the photographer, they appear to be bland and boring."
1,Book of Tree Stumps,"Boy, is this a waste. Perhaps an attempt to decry deforestation, this book is just a whole bunch of bad black & white photos of tree stumps. 100 pages of it anyway. Then there are 25 pages of wholly ordinary photos of some extremely underexposed trees and disjunctive tree parts.If the author wanted to make a statement he should have reconsidered publishing this book, since after all it was made from a tree."
4,Benjamin's secret within reach of us all.,"This is a well-made little organizer suitable for small odds and ends. It won't accommodate any of the cables I had in mind, but it does O.K. by small adapters. Now if I could find a simple write-on label that would stick for any length of time, I'd be off toward a start on a desktop with a saner surface. Unfortunately, I don't recall Mr. Robinson's saying anything about labels."
1,Critical waste of your money,"Throw this DVD of the critical review of Nirvana in and it starts out with about 20 seconds of great live footage before some goofball idiot interrupts the footage to tell us why Nirvana was a great band. The reason I bought the DVD was because I already figured that out. Save your money, this junk belongs in the trash. Retard after retard interrupting the concert footage and telling us what they think. Can I have my money back? All I want is the live footage, no commentary, no opinions. This is junk and doesnt even deserve a 1 rating. If anyone wants mine for the 15 bucks I spent I would be happy to ship it to you."
3,Zombies!,"This is not a bad two discs set for the price.Here we get:Bride of Re-Animator (R, 1990, 96 minutes)Beyond Re-Animator (R, 2003, 95 minutes)Return of the Living Dead 3 (R, 1993, 97 minutes)Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis (R, 2005, 88 minutes)Return of the Living Dead: Rave to the Grave (R, 2005, 86 minutes)Night of the Living Dead 2D (R, 2006, 80 minutes)I'm a big Zombie fan and this collection has two great movies, one decent movie and three below-average flicks. Bride of Re-Animator is the best out of the six, but once again we get the R rated version and not the uncut version. The same goes for it's lackluster sequel, Beyond Re-Animator. The underrated Return of the Living Dead 3 is the Rated R version instead of the uncut version that had came out on VHS years ago. The other three zombie flicks are low-budget sequels/remakes that are times painful to watch. I would only recommend those three for die-hard fans of both series as you might want to add them to your collection."
3,A quick zombie fix but not a zombie fan fantasy.,Well if you are looking for zombies and you don't hold high standards on this genre then well yes I guess you can buy this collection. Keep in mind all em feature C list actors who barely have any acting experience or none at all. Try not to delve too much into plot or reality as you will find that these movies tend to defy both. But if cheesey and unbelievable stunts and dialogue is your thing then this collection should probably belong in your shelf.
4,Black Mood,"Almost entirely instrumental, Tragic Animal Stories covers everything from bizarre carnival-style sounds (Itidarod Sled Dogs)to 1970s tripping music (Snail Trail of Tears), to off-kilter elevator muzac for the New Age (The Horrible Truth About Plankton). Derelict Vultures is one of the few tracks to have any rock leanings, with slow surf guitar exploding into brass-led jungle rhythms. Barry Black, alias Eric Bachmann of Archers of Loaf,has made an incredible album, but you've really got to be in the right mood to appreciate it. Over its thirty-nine or so minutes, Tragic Animal Stories projects a very weird soundtrack onto your life. Perhaps that's why it works so well."
2,It did not work for me,"I really didn't like this product at all. As a matter of fact, I ended up taking my dictionary with me to Italy instead. The translator was slow and not easy to use. The phasing is prewritten and had no relevance to me. I did not like the product at all."
3,"Good,but...","...I give this three stars not because it deserves 3 stars, but because, after hearing Nina Simone perform this song, Billie's didn't even come close.When I heard Billie perform this song, I thought yes, yes, well done.But when I heard Nina Simone sing this song, everything was sucked out of me inside, I felt empty;nina tore the life out of me, by the end of the song, there were tears streaming down my face.I will just say that Billie has had much better recordings, and this by far does not capture all of her greatness.But , I do have to say, that Nina is the true queen of jazz.Billie is magnificent, but she is not Nina.I am 13 years old, and I have nothing else to judge except for what I hear.And I just have to say that Billie's version will never,ever come close to Nina's.And if you can, please, search the world for Nina's rendition of Strange Fruit.It's the most beautiful thing you'll ever hear."
1,"Pleeze, Pleeze, Pleeze",I don't know what happened but this album needs to be slept on. This dude keeps rappin' about where he's from and junk like that. It's like he doesn't have anything else to say. While the production may be okay (it's questionable)the lyrics just plain suck. Hey Fiend give Dr. Dre a call.
1,Very disappointed!,"My husband put it together and halfway through he noticed it waswobbly and not very sturdy.When he finished, the whole thing was leaning to one side and the casters did not stay on. For a living he puts together desks, shelves and cabinets and could not believe the laundry center was so unstable for the price!"
2,Good idea... BAD construction,"I was so excited to get this... It looked to be a perfect fit for my needs. A place to hang and sort all in one. It's only problem is that it is just not sturdy. It wobbles and leans (even though all the pieces were very tightly put together). It was a wast of the money, and now because it is not very functional in it's wobbly state it is a waste of space."
5,Super good groove,"If you like Texas Blues at its finest buy this , Roy milton has help from Billy Butler and roy gaines , I think this was Roys best record ever !!! scotty"
1,Find another book on this subject,"I very rarely not finish a book. I could not get through half of this one. There is nothing in it about the players of Negro baseball. Mark Ribowsky just wastes your time with his huge vocabulary (keep a dictionary handy, you will need it at least once a paragraph) & his exhaustive knowledge of the soap operas behind the scene of the leagues. He spends no time talking about actually players, teams or the games they played. I am a fan of baseball history, but found this book far removed from baseball and more oriented to the war of words between the early, explotive owners of the Negro league clubs. A history of the game this is not."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS!,Avoid this book at all costs. It has little original research and is literally filled with dozens of factual errors. There are better books on this subject; this isn't one of them!
3,okay,"I am surprised by the negative reviews of this book. While not the most engaging book, it is definetely not terrible and certainly not a waste of time.This book is a nice introduction to the history of the negro leagues. In fact, if you have the opportunity, I recommend it."
2,Different,"Very Different from Guero. Three quarters of the album can be shelved after a listen, just a interesting/inferior other version. The remaining tracks shine, giving you a total different sound. The mellow remixes are rewarding."
2,Know there's something missing,"I bought Guerolito after hearing ""Heaven Hammer,"" the remixed version of Guero's ""Missing."" That remix, by Air, is the sort of product that makes remixes valid - it takes the passion and yearning lost in the original production of ""Missing"" and makes it feel at home in a louder, more tempting sonic landscape. That song became astonishing where the Guero song was simply alright, and the new song, ""Clap Hands,"" is at least a good time. However, it's hard to swallow the cobbled remixes on the rest of Guerolito - the beat and the original of, say, ""Earthquake Weather,"" (here as ""Terromoto Tempo"") are both individually appealing enough, but together sound dismayingly like they're from different planets and belong nowhere near each other. ""E-Pro"" becomes a groaning mess, the lovely ""Farewell Ride"" an electronic nightmare, and both those descrptions would be apt to describe the record as a whole."
3,Interesting takes on Beck's soundscape extraordinaire...,"Guero was (in my opinion) one of Beck's soundest albums. It combined his acoustic musings found on Sea Change with more eclectic offerings similar to Odelay. That in no way made it a rehash of his previous albums.Guerolito, however, seems a little dry. It almost seems that sending it to contributing remixers like Adrock (of Beastie Boys fame) and Boards of Canada removed the jingly, catchy ""Beck"" sound.Recommended if you are a fan of Beck's music, otherwise, check out Odelay or Guero before picking this one up."
2,Stick to the Orig,"I'm a big fan of Beck. And was very excited about picking this album up. However, every time I've listened to it, I've found myself taking it out after 5 or 6 songs and putting Guero on. I don't know, the production and re-mixing work is pretty good. But every song just left me wanting to hear the original.Now that Amazon is sold out, and you have to get it from 3rd party vendors, it's just not worth it."
3,Uninteresting...,"I love Beck. I have most of his albums. But ""Guerolito"", I simply don't get. ""Guero"" was one of his most solid albums to date, but this Mini-Me incarnation of his 2005 masterpiece doesn't spark much interest. Just skip it!"
1,How could this happen?,"I couldn't skip through the tracks fast enough. As the vomit started filling my esophagus, I couldn't help but wonder ""how could something be so bad."" Guero was great, the bands were talented in their own rights... I started with an open mind and ended up with an empty stomach."
2,I'm not bobbing my head anymore!,"I love Beck so I had to purchase this, but agree with many of the negative reviews. Very different from Guero, but not nearly as good. I almost found the mixes on Guerolito as obscure as his ""Hell Yes"" EP that were ""video game music sounding"" mixes of four Guero tracks that preceded that album's release.I did like the extra track, ""Clap Hands."" But it would probably be better just to download that track individually and add it to your Guero album."
5,Haha! Genious.,"This is the type of production that makes purists and pretencious ""fans"" feel robbed of a specify artist's experience. It's an extremelly artsy and in a way ""detached"" disc. Musically it's fresh to say the least and FUN! Careless, sweet, sexy, energetic, eclectic, well travelled, satisfying, devishly irreverent and it happens to be sung by Beck. A good way of explaining it would be: Appreciate if you saw someone whistling a really good tune and you found out it was Beck doing it, instead of expecting a good whistle because it's Beck. More than a ""buy it"", it's a must have for anyone with a twisted taste for raspy sound, dreamy ambiance and catchy lyrics."
3,Nice try remixers...,"Although Guerolito does present some very fine musical talent from various artists, about half of the compilation is nothing extraordinary. I am not supprised; it would be immensly difficult to remix ""Guero."" I bought this album with high expectations because of some prior amazing remixes of ""Guero"" that I have heard. It is worth buying for the serious Beck lover, but I would not recommend it to the occasional ""Where it's At"" or ""Loser"" listener.Like I've mentioned, many artists on Gueroito are commendable, (such as Adrock (from Beastie Boys), Air, Homelife, Octet, Th' Corn Gangg, and 8bit) but for the most part the remixers did not impress me too much with thier refabrications."
3,You had to have been there,"I was born in 1964, so I clearly recall seeing this show as a small child and thinking Doris day was pretty. I remember the theme song ""Que Sera Sera"""" while she was roaming through the rural area where the show took place bring supplemented by two children (in the cast?) and I remember the dog Tiger and the grumpy old man. For some reason, this show made me feel very warm and fuzzy as a small child watching this with my parents.I saw it again in the 1980s when CBN was running it. It still made me feel warm and fuzzy and it was fascinating to see these images that were lodged in the back of my brain from my very early childhood, but alas, that was the only real value of it as a whole. Yeah, it was corny, but it made me happy as a child, and what more could you ask?"
2,Incredibly insipid,"Hey, I like Doris Day -- I think she's underrated as an actress, and she is a very appealing personality. But when I recently saw some of these episodes, I could better understand why sitcoms soon became much more ""envelope-pushing."" The characters in this show are shallow, the situations are silly, the writing is trite and it's just all too nicey-nice. You can figure out in five minutes where each story is going, and you know that by the time you hear ""Que Sera Sera"" again, all will be right with the world. Buy ""Andy Griffith Show"" sets instead -- the stories were no less ""family-friendly,"" but the writing was superb and the characters were classic."
5,Perfect Love,Excellent music for lovers. Soothing and very real. I highly recommend any of Pamela Williams' music. She is the consummate performer.
5,One of the best live phish releases!,"This album is spetacular.Disc one starts with a good chalkdust torture, halfway decent divided sky and excellent sparkle.If nothing else buy this for disc 2! It is basically one long jam and flows perfectly with a killer 2001 to start off. Walk away is simply great.This is one of the best covers phish does. Have mercy is fair and we get a pretty good mound. I think this is one of the best Squirming Coils i have ever heard with a great, long paige solo at the end and a fantastic daniel saw the stone to end the disc. Disc 3 has a good long YEM and i really enjoyed hearing purple rain for my first time. Golgi appparatus is decent and la grange is a good treat. The filler isnt half bad, but not that neccesary on such a great live phish album."
3,Useful but flawed,"More than anything, this book convinces that Perl only masquerades as an object-oriented language. To implement features which come naturally to other, truly object-oriented languages such as Java, one must jump through hoops.The book itself is useful in parts, although overly long for its subject matter, and often confusing. Explanations are often made harder to understand by the examples, not easier. The author spends too much time discussing BAD approaches to a particular problem before showing us the ""right"" way.Overall, inferior to ""Advanced Perl Programming"" in its approach to teaching OO-Perl."
5,The first useful documentation on Perl OOP,"This is my favorite Perl book, alongside Advanced Perl Programming.When I first read it, I was very upset that 3 pages in particular had not simply been inserted into the original Camel book, which I think is one of the most important yet most poorly written programming books ever.I wish Damien Conway had written Camel and Llama."
5,Some Good Help figuring out OO Perl,"I've found a lot of good direction on figuring out and writing Object Oriented (OO) Perl programs in this book. The writer is also very humorous which adds to the enjoyment. A lot of what the material in this books is too advance for my current skill level, but I'm confident if and when I need it, this book will have 90% of what I need to know about OO Perl."
5,An superb introduction to McCarthyism,"Buckley's account of the most turbulent era of the 1950s may not be the most unbiased available, but it facilitates introduction to the McCarthyism. The Redhunter is a thoroughly readable novel in that it deals intelligently with an immensely complex topic and manages to successfully convey McCarthy's human traits and idiosycracies at the same time. According to Buckley, McCarthy incessantly muttered, ""How'm doing?"" to his aides in search of affirmation. Buckley does not purport to provide a traditional historical novel. In this case, though, the embellishment was appeciated. I desired an introduction to McCarthyism, and I was not disappointed."
4,Great read,"Compelling and dead-on, but lacks the insight into Joe McCarthy that I hoped for from Buckley. The origins of McCarthy's alcoholism and relentless pursuit of Communists remain undisclosed. But you can't put the book down."
5,Excellent,"In this lighthearted novel (remember, this IS a ""fictional"" novel, and not a history book - as seen by comments by radical left libarals complain in these reviews). However, it is accurate in the events that led up to, and during the all important era of communists infiltrating several branches of the US government/entities. If you want FACT, please read Whittaker Chambers' book entitled ""Witness"" which defines the events leading up to the communist era in the US, as well as the famous Alger Hiss trial.For those liberals who claim we were out to ""get"" those people who have a ""right"" to their political views, please, spare us. In the 40s, 50s, there was no room for anti-American and communist movements. They were at the time a very real threat to ""your"" democracy that you enjoy today."
2,Buckley's characters lack motivation or dimension,"Joseph McCarthy was fascinatingly complex, whether one agrees with his politics or not. A novel should be the perfect medium to explore what made him tick, and a wordsmith like William F. Buckley should be just the writer. Unfortunately, Buckley is content to recite a litany of activities coupled with a handful of traits to produce at best a two-dimensional portrait of McCarthy. Given the quality of Buckley's espionage fiction, this book is a literary disappoinment."
1,A heartfelt paean to a great American demagogue.,"REDHUNTER reads as if it were written with an axe on the spinning wheel of a grindstone. The saddest thing, though, is that most of today's readers are likely to agree with Buckley that there is a place in America for persecution of an individual solely on the basis of his or her political beliefs, if those beliefs differ from those of the majority. This, of course, was how the Nazis began. It could just as easily happen here, too, and nearly did. I would give this book 0 stars if that option were afforded me. In every respect, an appalling performance."
5,A wonderful resource for fans of the Big G.,"For some reason I can't understand, I've always enjoyed Godzilla movies because there was just something about a giant lizard fighting other large monsters as well as thwarting man in his effort to destroy what they can not control. I got this book because what amazed me was that it gave information on all of the Godzilla movies (at the time) which also included those that had never been released in the USA. It also detailed how the Godzilla suit has evolved through the years as well as a few articles of how you can use Godzilla as a parenting model, much to shaking head of my wife-to-be at the thought of having our future children behaving....improving their behavior on how to act like monsters."
3,"3 1/2 stars...too much praise, not enough appraisal.","In some ways I was very disappointed by this book, particularly since it was written by the publisher of ""G-Fan"", a frequently excellent magazine about kaiju eiga. Mr. Lees has a lot of information that Godzilla fans will be drooling over, but quite frankly he hypes every G-movie to DEATH, not even remotely admitting the trashiness of films like ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"". He just can't seem to print a negative word about his precious Godzilla, much to the book's detriment, since just about any reader can see the lack of objectivity in it.While there are some interesting tidbits in the book, quite frankly they are overshadowed by the wealth of details in books like ""Japan's Favorite Mon-Star"". Reading this book left me with the overwhelming impression that this was a book written by Godzilla nerds, for Godzilla nerds. Too bad that it falls as short as it does."
3,The handbook to Godzilla,"The only thing I don't like about this book is that J.D. Lees and Marc Cerasini don't say a SINGLE negative word about Godzilla. This has synopsises and comments on each Godzilla film excluding TriStar's American Godzilla and Godzilla 2000. This has very stupid things where a psychologist and paleontologist have essays about Godzilla. However, it has its high points--synopsises, comments, and monster bios and appearances. If you're a G-fan like I am, certainly this is yours for the taking."
2,"Entertaining, but Flimsy","This book will make a fun read for Godzilla fans, but as a compendium for a monster who has appeared in over twenty films, a TV cartoon, novels, comics, and so forth, 145 pages is pretty darned flimsy. Adding to it is the fact that pages which could have been used to publish more information on the character are soaked up by silly chapters like ""Godzilla as a Parenting Tool"", and a chapter where paleontologist Kenneth Carpenter studies the beast as a dinosaur. Pretty pointless since the big G is a guy in a rubber suit that only vaguely resembles any creature that ever walked the planet. The synopsis of all of the films is good, but the behind the scenes sections are too short. Artwork by acclaimed artist Art Adams and others compliment the book, but there's too much visual in this and not enough factual information. In the end, this book comes off as more of a big fannish magazine than an exaustive source of information. And that's a shame."
4,Our favorite Godzilla guide.,"Our favorite Godzilla guide. 144 pages filled with Godzilla history, movie information, pictures, statistics, art, comic book covers, original movie posters and lots more. A really great reference guide for Godzilla fans!"
3,Ok coverage of the Godzilla clan,"the book is lightweight but picture intensive. As a Godzilla fan, I didn't learn any new background information as opposed to another recent book ""Monsters Are Attacking Tokyo : The Incredible World of Japanese Fantasy Films"""
3,"Sorry guys, godzilla just doesn't have it","Hello, my name is Jim Wood. I am a fan of the only really great giant monster, King Kong. I've heard a lot about how great your giant lizard is, but it's not 100 percent sane. This book's okay other than the subject. With his new movie and this book and all, Godzilla is getting way more attention than he deserves. After all, no one should forget who won when King Kong met Godzilla."
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!,"I love this book, I carry it in my back pack every where, but my only complant is that it dosn't tell you the japanese plot summery for Gojira, but other then that go and buy it if you haven't read it!"
3,Under Armours womens sport socks,The socks are okay but the tops are very snug and leave a circular band of red skin where it has been compressed too much. I bought them to replace my thorlos sports socks. I ended up having to order the thorlos because they are more comfortable. I still use the under armour socks but I push them down to keep from getting the compression band around my shins.
4,I want to hear more,"Ok, I have only seen a few quick minutes of the Sprite commercial that has Robin singing ""When I get you alone"", but that was all it took. I'm hooked and can't wait to hear more. I have pre-ordered the album, but they keep pushing the release date back. I can't wait to hear what the entire CD sounds like."
5,Fantastic!,"From the sampling of Walter Murphey's ""A Fifth Of Beethoven"" to the textured lyrics to the driving vocals, this is a great single. The first time I heard it, I knew I had to own it."
2,good song from a commercial?!,"good song, from a Sprite Commercial that had me bopping my head when I first heard it. He has a good voice but I will wait for his cd to come out and reviews before I buy it."
2,Not great,"Unfortunately, it's boring and the sound is not great either.Better watch it with your own music."
1,The BAD Florida Beaches,"I bought two DVDs of Waves Virtual Vacation series. They're Best of Bahama Beaches and Florida Beaches. They're all waste of money because they show the same scenes from the beginning till the end.All I could see was the waves hitting the beach from one angle. After approximate 10 minutes the camera switched to another angle or another location. But basiclly it still showed the same scenes! That means, I still saw wave hitting the beaches. Once in a while I saw some trees plus the beaches and the waves. I could have made these DVDs with my own camcorder!They're not worth buying at all."
4,Humor in the Old West,"A less-than-honest former Confederate calvaryman from Texas teams up with a straight-arrow former Union infantryman from Kentucky. These two ""gents"" form a team that knows how to shoot, fight, retreat, and deliver one liners with the best. All of the books in this series are worth reading, but if you demand gunfights in your Westerns, you should probably stick to the first two of the Gents novels."
1,Don't get on his email list,"I was unaware of John Zachman until recently, when myself and everyone in my company began receiving daily emails from his minions, encouraging us to become ""Zachman Certified"". Since out spam filters quickly caught all of these emails, I have to assume that thousands of others have been receiving the same unsolicited emails too and marking them as spam. I understand the concept of aggressive marketing, but it always forces me to wonder the value of any proposition that has to be rammed down your throat. Maybe becoming ""Zachman Certified"" would be a life changing event, but I really do wish they'd lose my email address."
4,EAP - A Management Framework,"This is an excellent book outlining the process, content and pit-falls associated with EAP (a classic for consultants and professionals). It is important to remember that it presents a management framework not an implementation framework. I look forward to the next release -I hope it includes something on object modelling and UML and the need to differentiate between functional and competency based modelling (Business Architecture) when designing enterprise information systems for the future. This book is a foundation and a ""must read"" for any budding Enterprise Architect."
4,EAP a Requirement for Aligning IT and Your Business,"This is an excellent book. It presents a complete plan of how to implement a business oriented strategy planning program that will align IT with the strategies being pursued by your organization. This book does not provide all of the answers. It points out, correctly and in an easy-to-read format, that you, as an IT executive, must adapt the program presented here to your own situation.However, the program outline is more extensive and more valuable than any I've seen before. It is also better than the program outline that I've personally seen delivered by top name consulting firms.Coupling this book with practicle experience, and readings on both total quality management, and marketing will provide the budding planner with a successful intellectual tool set for creating an improved IT/Business alignment.Dan Ashley, PhD dcashley@aol.com"
5,Excellent Foundation to Engineer the Enterprise,"Stephen's book is pivotal in truly understanding all the Homework that needs to be done in order to achieve an accountable Business Driven Enterprise. For the time that it was written in 1992, the insight was truly amazing, and as Matt K put it... ""He wrote the book that told everyone else how to do it"". This work is foundational, and should be read by anyone who considers themselves a serious Architect of any type. No matter the framework, the interrogatives are the factual blanks that must be filled in."
2,not enough,"not so much imagery as i had hoped. most of the designs are that of rugs and not of actual knots and different designs. and there arent many images. the book is thin, and didnt give me a lot to go on since i am using it for tattoo designs."
4,Courtney is a guy!,"Just an aside comment on the above review...Courtney Davis is actually a guy, not a gal. He's really nice and a very considerate person who loves his art, check it out if you get a chance!"
2,The long and winding road,"As one who usually reads more established scientific literature, I wanted something a bit ""lighter"" as I recovered from a knee operation. The ufo phenomenon has always interested me, and I haven't drawn any conclusions as to the validity of this subject. The author does an excellent job of cataloguing the testimonials of witnesses to these phenomena, and for this I admire her. The problem for me was mostly the layout of the book. The testimonials are strung together in a seemingly endless fashion, and the reading soon becomes tedious. There seems to be no organization, retrospection, or synthesis to the text. After reading this book, I feel I have no more understanding of the ufo phenomenon."
4,"Works well, a bit bulky","This product works well and is essential for making the Treo 650 a usable mp3 player. It is a little big, however."
3,Does it's job but....,Bought this adapter to listen to music on my treo with my best headphones. But after using this adapter i have concluded that the treo is not for music. Treo has bad music quality so this adapter is of no use.
3,"Works as promised, generally well.","This adapter works as promised. The sound quality is good. I have no complaints about how the product functions. However, it is slightly bulky and the 90 degree bend in it seems to cause strain on the jack inside the treo. It has not caused any problems for me yet, but I am concerned that it might break something later."
2,"Too bulky, comes loose, there are better options...","I have a Treo and my wife has a Centro.I like the ease of use of the Palm devices and they do make good MP3 players. I use mine with headphones and in my car.I have this particular ""right angle"" adapter and I don't like it. It is very bulky and always comes loose as it swings around. This type of adapter is best if you are not moving your Treo/Centro around such as if you are jacking it into a sound dock. I would give this Palm right angle adapter one star for effectiveness but since it does have good build quality I give it two stars. Alot of third party adapters have very poor build quality.The other Palm version on Amazon is way better, ""Palm 3397WW Stereo Headphone Audio adapter"". This version doesn't come loose, especially with headphones if you are moving around. The best adapter I've found so far for my Treo and Centro. A few bucks more but well worth it...I gave this one four stars (would have been five stars but price is a bit high)."
3,It works,"This ""stereo headphone adapter"" takes 3.5mm female 3-conductor (stereo, same as most headphones) to 2.5mm male 3-conductor (stereo, same diameter as the Treo 600, 700 series jacks). The Treo's jack is actually a 4-conductor (two stereo audio out, one mono audio in (for microphone), one ground), but this adapter just ignores the mono in conductor. Altogether, this allows your Treo audio out (but not audio in) to work with standard headphones. Yeah.As previous reviewers have said, the product works and has good sound quality, but the form factor is flawed. The adapter's rigid design puts a lot of pressure on it and on your Treo's jack when it's in use. It would be better if it had a short, flexible cord between the male and female ends."
3,Feminist viewpoint,"This book provides a feminist viewpoint to Marilyn's films and life. When the book was written in the 1970s, the author provided a fresh insight into Marilyn. Now it might be considered ""old hat"" since so many authors now take the same viewpoint. Remember, Marilyn was not especially admired by women when she died. This book is written by a woman who is sympathetic to Marilyn's life and desire to improve herself. This book is valuable to those who are Marilyn collectors. Otherwise, pass on this one."
5,Should reach legend status.,"I truly believe that if every anime fan looked past the strange name and gave this show a watch, it would be every bit as legendary as Cowboy Bebop. Why do I compare it to Bebop? It has that cool factor. I can't even describe the quality put into every aspect of the show. Not only that, but it even has a very nice setting. The animation is amazing. Art is beautiful and unique. The music is just incredible. Like nothing I've ever heard in anime.The only downfall is the overall story. While each episode has a good story itself, the overall story doesn't amount to much.Overall, a must-own."
4,"Interesting plot twists, well-done action, and a fantastic music score.","Heat Guy J is one damn fine show. At first, the story comes off as something of a cliche (a pair of investigators try to stop a Mafia crime boss and other villians) but further into the series, excellent twists take place and intrigue buildup turns it into an addicting watch. On top of that, Action scenes are smooth and plentiful and NEVER use still images, the music good with an extremely cool bagpipe-rock track for the action scenes, and the main villian Clair Leonelli is a very unpredictable character.As far as bad qualities go, the show used too much 3D CGI. I am very put off by CGI because it never looks nearly as cool and it never fits well with the regular animation."
3,Great DVD release. Poor packaging.,"The quality of the S.A.V.E. version of Heat Guy J was very good. The picture quality looked less compressed than I expected and the sound was very clear. The 3 star rating is for the packaging. As with all of the S.A.V.E. DVDs I've purchased, all (or most) of the spokes on the DVD hubs arrive broken off and loose in the case. This leaves nothing for the DVD to rest in and the DVDs end up bouncing around in transit. I always end up buying more clear cases and transferring the insert and DVDs to them. What I ""S.A.V.E."" in money I end up spending on another case(s). One might wonder if this was the sellers fault but it doesn't matter where I buy the S.A.V.E. DVDs. They always arrive with the spokes broken."
2,Not as good as it could have been,"These compilation has some great songs, but only a few by the original singers and although a few are ""good enough"" others are ""awful;"" so if you don't mind how the songs sound like, buy it, otherwise, you've been warned."
5,good stuff,if you are using a reverse osmosis water for your freshwater fish tank you need this. Its not an optional thing you NEED it because the reverse osmosis takes out all the hardness in the water and this puts it back in. this will make your fish tank a lot healthier then using tap water with conditiona. My dicus fish are very happy since I started using this
4,Product worked great,The RG11 wire was great. Installed a 500' run with no lose of signal. The spoll that the wire was on fell apart during the wire pull and made the job real hard. Be careful with the spool when pulling wire.
4,Insanely good fun,"This tale is just good smart fun, by an author who can combine the tools of disciplined writing craft and undisciplined imagination with incredibly entertaining results.In a nutshell, I knew that Steve Vernon was a good writer when I found myself cheering for a decapitated head. Anyone that can put such personality into a dislodged appendage, simply by internal dialogue, deserves kudos in my book."
2,Long horn review,"Fun story. Mostly a collection of different ideas for zombies jammed together and set in the old west. No development of the characters, so don't expect to get to caught up in the story. It's a whimisical read."
2,hard to follow,"The author is kind of jerky in his writing, making me reread previous paragraphs to see what this new one references. Tried reading it but was never able to build enough interest to want to pick it up again. The plot is muddy, going off in strange tangents, the characters also. Maybe you have to be British to enjoy this one. Two-thirds of the way through, I finally gave up and got a new book."
1,Wordbound.,"Poetry is the ultimate headrush. It's an unscheduled eclipse, unexpected lightning from a clear blue sky, a storm that engages senses and emotions. It's orgasmic. Collins' work is not poetry. Further, it eradicates the necessary line between poetry and prose. It's wordbound. There is no room left for that remarkable tango between mind and emotion that dances us away from politics and Wall Street and into the soul of our humanity. There is no space here. Collins constructs a prison of words. It is heresy to compare this man to Frost, as I understand some are doing."
1,Nothing to Say,"Billy Collins is the only poet I know that writes about doing nothing. With his newest collection, we find Billy looking out the window, staring at a water stain on a ceiling, watching clouds change into animals in the sky, and so on. In ""Bermuda,"" Collins writes: ""we come about as close/as a man and a woman can/to doing nothing."" Is all this supposed to be amusing? Enlightening? With ""Nine Horses,"" it becomes painfully obvious that our Poet Laureate has nothing to say, but says it anyway."
1,Wordbound.,"Poetry is the ultimate headrush. It's an unscheduled eclipse, unexpected lightning from a clear blue sky, a storm that engages senses and emotions. It's orgasmic. Collins' work is about nothing in particular. It's not poetry. Further, it eradicates the necessary line between poetry and prose. It's wordbound. There is no room left for that remarkable tango between mind and emotion that dances us away from politics and Wall Street and into the soul of our humanity. There is no space here. Collins constructs a prison of words. It is heresy to compare this man to Frost, as I understand some reviewers are doing."
3,Not Touching,"In Sailing Alone Around the Room, Billy Collins gathered some of his most breath-taking pieces, some new ones and many drawn from his previous works like Scotland, Not Touching, and I Chop Some Parsley...I am sure his readers, who were enamored with his engaging and unpretentious style wished that Nine Horses would serve a similar dish or even better, but it does not. Simplicity was beauty in Sailing, but Nine Horses is too plain. How I wish Collins would write more poems similar to Duck/Rabbit and Not Touching."
5,My favorite poetry book ever.,This book inspired me to write poetry. This is my favorite poetry book from my favorite poet. Several of my favorite poems of all time are in this book. Get it!
4,this is why he is laureate,"Billy Collins is the everyman's poet. Regardless of whether or not he'll be remembered a hundred years from now, and regardless of some people's opinion of the content of his verse, he is a good poet. He is one of the few who successfully use humor in his poems. His poems are easy to understand, but still have a literary backing to them. You don't have to have a doctorate in English to understand what he writes, but you can tell Collins is intelligent and well-read. You find yourself chuckling at some poems, and many times wishing you had come up with a phrase or an idea he uses. Read this collection (or his new and selected) and you'll understand why he has the popularity he does."
5,An Archetypal Watch,"I admit to having an affinity for very clean-faced, classic watches. I first bought this watch with a brown leather band. The version shown has rose gold hour markers (not mentioned) which give it a much more elegant look than the blued steel markers also available. The minute markers are much finer in person than in any photo, including Omega's own, and the face has a beautiful balance. The movement runs nicely, and the sweep-second hand stops with the screw-down crown pulled out to the last position, for people who set their watch with a vengeance! Though I collect watches, the Aqua Terra Big Size has gotten more Wrist-Time than any other watch I have. Even on a slender wrist (like mine) it spans perfectly and has a sort of ""Sixties Classic on steroids"" look. It's big... but just right."
3,Jedi Mind Tricks Returns With An Interesting Hip-Hop Mix,"Underground rap pioneers Jedi Mind Tricks new release features an assortment of guests, including members of Non-Phixion, as well as Tragedy Khadafi, Can-I-Bus, & Kool G Rap. This album is well produced, with solid beats and slick, varied samples. Memorable tracks include Animal Rap & Kublai Khan. There are some smooth interlude tracks on this album (though the use of interludes on rap/hip-hop CDs is becoming overdone in the genre). Nevertheless, the tone of this album is angry, filled with braggadoccio and even brief bytes of homophobia. Previous albums by this act were more thoughtful and featured more conscious lyrical creations. While better than most MTV/BET oriented hip-hop music, this album is disappointing and seems to be conforming more to mainstream hip-hop influences. I much prefer Jedi Mind Tricks previous releases, and hope that this album's lyrical assault is not a direction that the group will continue in."
2,what the hell happened!!!,Jedi mind did the unthinkable and made a commercial album.When I heard the opening track with canibus I knew I was in for something earth shattering.Instead I was in for some salsa dancing.The whole album sounds like out takes from an old big- pun demo. I could'nt believe this was the same group responsible for psycho social and violent by design.Canibus album blows this away.I't was fun while it lasted.
2,The mothership has crashed and burned.,"Psycho-Social is probably in my top 10 played CDs over the past 5 years. I really, really liked Violent By Design. I finally got Visions of Gandhi the other day, and what a waste. All the songs sound the same, and Ikon has really regressed with his raps ... he went from arguably the most out-there (in a good way) musician, in company with Sun Ra, George Clinton and Dr Octogon -- now he just comes up with lame raps about how tough he is and 5th grade insults about how much he hates you. **YAWN** Do yourself a favor and skip this and go get the Psycho-Social CD by these guys, and remember the days when they were still worth listening to. The only reason they get 2 stars instead of 1 is for the beats, which these cats always do well."
2,This CD is utterly sad,"Okay, you may have seen a review I posted a few months ago singing praises for this CD. Please understand, after literally boycotting radio b/c of all the monotonous garbage they play (of all varieties, though pop is starting to attain a bit more substance, but that's never really been my thing), ""Visions of Ghandi"" seemed like a breath of fresh air. However, after a few months the CD started to get a little tired. Thought it's not as corny as the stuff on the radio, the blatant homophobia, religism, and tired violent hip-hop cliches make this a rather lackluster performance from Vinnie. Moreover, Stoupe has seemed to have fallen off as well. You may offer your rebuttal on this one, since there are still those out there who adore his beats, but I have to say, ""nuh-unh!"" Judging by the content on this particular joint, it is safe to ascertain that Mr. Paz has fallen into a state of intellectual catatonia."
2,more of the same!!!,jeesh! if they could just come up with some more topics of general interest rather than plowing the same old ground over and over and over and over. you get the idea. some really interesting beats n samples.the music was fresh but the text was mighty tired. try Peanutbutter Wolf or the World Famous Beat Junkies. maybe M Boogie fer a change.
3,par,"Out of three albums, this one lags behind. The production seemed a little rushed, so the beats--sub-par. Lyrically, this is still one of the tightset groups around...although I miss the style exhibited in the psycho-social LP.Vinny Paz is still one of the best out there, but this album doesn't shine his potential.True JMT fans....don't even listen to this one.I guess the legacy is over..."
4,almost but not quite,"As JMT's production gets weirder, the rhymes get more banal. I feel like they reached their peak with Violent by Design...in psychosocial the production wasnt quite as slick and the lyrics were a little forced (too many sci-fi metaphors that didnt quite make sense). And this album has fallen into the trap of boring gangsta lyrics, with outright incongruous and wacky production. Not to say that the production itself isnt good, and wasnt specifically meant to contrast like it does...the only problem is it doesnt quite work. This is quite a good album, but more of a novelty piece. It's worth getting, but i certainly wont be listening to it over and over like Violent by Design."
3,Disapointing,"I'm a huge fan of Jedi Mind Tricks. Violent by Design is one of my all time favorites. I've been waiting for the new release eagerly. But Visions of Gandhi is a disapointment. The presence of Jus Allah is really missed. Left by himself, Vinnie Paz is too overbearing. Stoup's production is as good as ever, but Vinnie comes on too strong. Some good tracks: Animal Rap, Blood in Blood Out. Paz's hatred is annoying. Too much homophobia. Too bad because I still think they're one of the most unique acts out there."
3,great production-bad lyrics,stoupe is a great producer and on every release including this one it definitely shows. I really enjoyed the salsa flavored tracks that have become a trademark of stoupes production. vinnie paz is ussually a good lyricyst although I dont appreciate the whole satanic theme that is portrayed on several songs on this album the track with Canibus is also a plus. as much as I love the production on this joint I dont really see myself supporting these guys in the future unless Stoupe is producing for Canibus.
2,Sleepy,"Sorry but JMT did not live up to my expectations on this album. Track 4 and the track with Canibus are the only tracks that are honorable. It is as if they did not spend quality time on it at all. You compare this to ""Violent by Design"" and I gurantee you will see what I am referring to. No Apathy, Jus Allah, Tragedy Khadafi? C'mon now...when you get all those heads laying down complex mind boggling lyrics you can't loose. Overall I will still always be a JMT fan...."
4,This Is One ILL album...but not as good as Violent By Design,"This was a great album...Stoupe has evolved alot as a producer, and Vinnie has become even rawer with his psychological lyrics. Although their album has alot of Spanish beats, the lyrics bring the album back. My favorite tracks are ""Tibetan Black Magicians"" with Canibus, which he rips it with JMT and i havent heard him do such a great job since ""Liberal Arts"", and ""Blood In Blood Out""....that beat is sick.....eventhough it cant match Violent By Design, its worth buying anyways."
4,Good,"Well, I'd say all of these songs are well constructed, dope lyrics whatever... but wth? all the basslines sound the same or what? Personally i prefer Violent By Design over this."
1,Sucks!,"I've been a fan of Jedi Mind Tricks for a long time and I must say that this is the worst cd Ikon and Stoupe have put out thus far. The beats are WAY too Flamenco, and Ikon, I just definately don't see him as a ""thug"" or ""killa"". That's all he raps about now. What about Psycho Social album? I'd rather Ikon be a f---in nerd than a ""thug"". This album sucks!"
2,Not What You'd Expect From These Cats,"If you have never heard JMT, you might like this disc more than loyal fans. But as someone who's been listening to JMT for a while now, I gotta say that I was disappointed with the lyrical maturity of most of these songs. Granted, JMT's never had the tightest lyrics, but still, VP falls seriously short on most tracks. Especially when he's gotta go up against some of the best beats I've heard from an underground album in recent months. In fact, the beats are so dope on some of these songs, you almost wish that VP or any of the guest emcee's weren't rapping over them. It's as if the album is torn between mediocrity and excellence. ""Blood In Blood Out"" & ""Animal Rap"" have some of the best Stoupe beats I've ever heard. Nevertheless, they're still not good enough to keep this disc from heading toward the bottom of the pile.Mr. Oat says, too f---ing bad, cause I was looking forward to this album."
2,what the hell happend to jedi mind?????,"yo, remember when jedi mind was dope? yeah, me too. this album is weak. the beats are a really bad example of what stoupe can do and vinnie paz needs to get his teeth knocked out for spitting some of the worst rhymes i've heard in the underground world in the past 5 or 6 years.if you're looking at this trying to decide between this and violent by design you're in a bit of trouble. first, violent by design blows this out of the water. second, violent by design is a little dated and unless you had it like 7 years ago you're probablly not going to be nearly as into it now as you would've then.vinnie paz basically can't rhyme so don't even bother picking anything up aside from violent by design."
1,horrible,Jedi mind tricks went commercial. Every track on this LP sounds the same. The only things decent are the guest appearences.
1,"Don't buy this CD. Buy the ""GREATEST CHINESE FOLK SONGS"" instead","I own this CD, and another CD -- the ""GREATEST CHINESE FOLK SONGS"" by Bears Children Choir.On a scale on 1 to 10, I rate this CD as a 2.This CD sound artificial. The instruments sound like cheap synthesizers.The other CD -- the ""GREATEST CHINESE FOLK SONGS"" by Bears Children Choir is much better. The children's voices are pure and natural. The instruments in the background do not overwhelm. it is an 11 over 10."
4,soothing music,"I was looking for Chinese music CDs for my kids to learn Chinese. This CD has beautiful singing and music. What it doesn't have is songs suitable and easy for very young kids. My children still enjoy listening to it, they just can't really sing along since the arrangement of the music is more complicated."
4,Good singing but pretty awful musical accompaniment,"This is my first CD with Chinese music on, so I made every effort not to make it a bad first impression. Luckily, you can have a foretaste of the music through those 30 second samples that amazon provides. And yes, the quality of the singing voice is excellent and the recording clear. However, the background instrumental is pretty horrible on some of the tracks. Probably, it was a low budget project and they could not hire proper musicians with acoustic instruments or at least with a quality synthesizer. Sometimes it gives you the feel of computer music in the first part of the 90's. All in all, the songs are well worth the money, but if you want to experience real Chinese instrumental music, try, for example,Classical Chinese Folk Music."
3,OHH PLEASE,"what the hell is wrong with you people? this cd is terrible someone said the jams are extra tight???? it sounds as if no one knows what the hell is going on, the vocals arent loud enough (not that thats a bad thing!) neither is the guitar the guitar solos are good but ALWAYS seem out of key, the songs are boring and the lyrics are stupid. one thing i dont under stand is why they even have a keyboard player wow hes horrible. now dont get me wrong i like phish but get A LIVE ONE its alot better sound quality songs a jams and keyboard player is accually bareable to listen to."
5,Amazing Concert From a Big Phish Fan,"This is quite possibly the best set of the Live Phish series. I am a big phish fan, and this is one of my favorites. The only downpoint is when the crowd breaks out into a bunch of shushing, but it only happens a few times. Plenty of classics, plenty of great jamming, there is no way to not like this one."
