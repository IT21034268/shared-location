1,"Hey, CANDYTALK didn't you review for THE STRANGER?",The above mentioned alias to my intuition wrote for a local newspaper called THE STRANGER. Sounds like some major a$$ kissing for a hometown band of hipsters (they were featured in a fashionable urban clothing store advertisement I saw recently.) Anyway they were hyped up for a couple a years before signing a deal. Seemed like they never played any shows around here in Seattle. I wonder why...
2,Same stuff,"This DVD begins in exactly the same way as all other Stott tapes, with way too much time taken up with ""slow breathing."" Breathing is NOT a warm-up. Most exercise physiologists know this. And to be honest, these exercises are on other Stott tapes.Stott likes to take one workout and stretch it between all their Pilates tapes. Though, admittedly, all the tapes are beautifully done, and the best of the batch of exercise options in terms of clarity and explanation, if you get one of their PILATES BASICS DVDS, or ESSENTIAL MATWORK DVDS, you more or less have it all.Ball workouts and exercise band workouts, excluded, of course. Although many of those workouts use the same exercises, adding the toys, as well.Still ----- I recommend the basics workouts Stott does above all the others I've viewed."
5,"A good, steady workout","I've been doing Pilates at home (and in a gym) for 7 years. This workout offers the best I've seen. I rotate my Pilates' DVD's but I choose this one at least twice a week. It begins with excellent breathing, stretching, AND positioning your body. The workout is excellent. It's as good as an hour at the gym. Although I've done it more than 100 times, it remains challenging. This is because 'form' is so important, and there is always room for improvement with your form. My abs are so much stronger, and I give credit to this DVD. For a really short, intense quickie workout, I strongly recommend Classical Pilates."
1,NO NO NO NO!,"I teach pilates/yoga (3 or so years) so I am always looking for a more challenging workout video. First of all, the title says level 2 but the DVD says level 3. The workout is very dry, dull, and UNCHALLENGING!!!!!!! It should be a beginners workout and can be done by clildren it is so unbelieveable easy. I am sorry that I wasted my money to purchase this. ALL the Stott DVDs are to the same dull format (2 people working out while one woman with a monatone voice rambles on and on about the exercise). Please DO NOT purchase this if you want a workout."
4,"Not early, but accurate!","I tested with these strips beginning 7DPO, as the instructions said. I got a negative result at 7, 10, & 12DPO (that's why I love these - so cheap I don't feel guilty testing and testing!). I gave it the final test on day 31 of my cycle, since I was officially late, and got a VERY faint line. I had a leftover Clearblue Easy test, so I tested again later that day, and got a no-doubt positive. So the verdict is - you can't test as early as the website suggests, and the positive line may be quite faint. It was certainly nowhere near the darkness of the control line. But at less than a buck a pop, they work!"
4,"Works fine, especially if you use a large quantity","I used a bunch of these tests and was starting to think they were faulty. But this month I tested 15 dpo and got a positive result! The only problem with these strips is you have to collect your urine because it won't work with your urine stream like most store-bought tests. However, it's worth it when you normally pay anywhere from $5-$10 for just one test and these are way below that cost so you feel less guilty for testing too early."
3,You get what you pay for!,"I recieve two(!) false positives with this product during one cycle. They played with my emotions lol. However, they are less than a dollar a test. What can you expect? I did recieve good results with the opk strips sold by this company and will continue to use those."
2,Pregnancy tests give false positives,These pregnancy strip tests gave consistently false positives (not evaporation lines as they occurred within the time frame). I'd say about 50% of the time I would see a faint blue line in addition to the test line when I was not pregnant.
1,Didn't work for me...,I got these when we were trying to conceive our second child last spring. I took a test a couple of times during the 10 days before my period time frame. They all came back negative. I ended up taking an EPT test a week after I missed my period and got a positive reading.
1,How can I rate any star if I receive nothing?,"I ordered more than 2 weeks ago and nothing ever came! More ridiculous, they sent me the shipment email same day I ordered and charged me right away. Poor seller, I won't buy again and I am going to request an refund."
4,Pencils and Sharpener,"I am finding that the sharpener is functional but still the lead becomes a;most a little too pointed for construction. I think it is still handy though to have it around. Its faster than using the utility knife and sometimes or most times I need a sharper edge to mark with. Not all that bad, but might not be everybodies cup of tea. The sharpener that is. Otherwise, the pencils are like everybody elses and work. Not much to say there."
1,Extreemly Overpriced,"Save yourself some money and go to your local orange ""big box"" store where they have this exact same item for a third of the price!"
1,Get Home Depot's version for 10 cents a piece.,"Bought the set of 10 for $10, thinking I was getting a good deal compared to prices I'd seen at local hardware stores. Then went to HD and saw they sold each pencil for 10 cents, or $1 for 10. They also sell the set (with sharpener) for ... I want to say $2?"
4,versa sharp pencils,"These are like what my father used. I have not used them yet, so don't know how the pencil sharpener works."
5,"""These Precious Illusions In My Head...""","Alanis Morissette is one of the most genius women in the music industry. Despite the accusation that she is ""smoking something,"" I think ""Precious Illusions"" is one of the best songs on ""Under Rug Swept."" In it, Alanis addresses new concerns (as always). Alanis wants to find something real, but she can't give up her ""precious illusions."" She starts with the thought that when you know who you aren't, you'll know who you must be. By the end of the song, she realizes she still has to go with herself.It's an incredible song, a triumphant single and a powerful message to go with what feels right to you. Alanis is a talent that is hard to meet and a musical force to be reckoned with for years to come."
5,Fox Rocks!,"The rise in home schooled children show that parents have been waking up to the indoctrination found in our children's textbooks. Pathetic, incorrect rewritings of our history (Excellent book THE POLITICALLY INCORRECT GUIDE TO THE FOUNDING FATHERS by Brian McClanahan, PHD), blatant lies peddled as truth (recent example: Al Gore's movie) and a complete lack of regard for the Christian beliefs that helped shape this Nation. If you have children on their way to college as I do now there are two books I HIGHLY recommend. The first is ""CHOOSING THE RIGHT COLLEGE"" the whole truth about America's top schools, an EXCELLENT ISI Guide produced by the intercollegiate studies institute. The other book is an eye opener by David Horowitz called, ONE PARTY CLASSROOM."
2,WORST OF MORELL,"I LIKE WAR STORIES BUT THIS IS JUST A RAMBLING OF NAMES AND EVENTS. ESSENTIALLY AN OLD VETERAN OF SEVERAL WARS GIVES A HARD TIME TO A YOUNG MAN BARELY OUT OF HIS TEENS WHO SEEMS TO SEE THE VET AS A HERO. THE LAD IS ANXIOUS TO SEE ACTION IN THE WAR IN MEXICO BUT THE VET JUST SEEMS TO NOT CARE WHETHER THE KID STAYS WITH HIM OR NOT. THIS BOOK SEEMS TO BE A STORY MORRELL SAW IN HIS DREAMS, NODDING OFF IN FRONT OF HIS TV WHILE WATCHING AN OLD WESTERN FROM THE EARLY 1930s. IF YOU LIKE MORRELL'S MYSTERY THRILLERS, SKIP THIS ONE!"
1,Don't waste your time.,The author of this book needs remedial education concerning the basics of writing; there is no evidence the author has any writing skills at all.
2,Rather tedious; poor style,"The stype of writing is tedious. Sentences go one and on and on, with a dozen or so commas in each. The author uses visual images instead of visual decriptives in his narration, which makes for a poorly written book. The author had a great idea, but he must first learn how to write so that he can display that great idea properly."
5,The original Toy Story,"A great story about a group of toy expecting the arrival of new toys to the community, but this time it's Christmas toys, not Birthday. Last year's ""Best Toy Ever"" doesn't understand that he's about to be replaced and decides he needs make his way down to the Christmas tree so he can be ""The Christmas Toy"" again this year."
4,Good family movie,cute movie. I loved this as a child and bought it for my nieces and nephews for christmas so they could enjoy it too.
5,for the kids,I saw this years ago on tv and wanted for my grandkids. It is great. As usual for the muppets
4,the christams toy,this another masterpiece by jim henson. you can cleary pixar got the idea for tou story from this christmas special. a must have dvd for all christmas/holiday special fans
3,"It's no ""Emmett Otter""","While ""The Christmas Toy"" has it's cute moments--such as when the cat toy saves the day--overall it lacks the depth of story and characterization that other Muppet fare has, most notablyEmmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas.It does have heart, as all Muppet productions during the Jim Henson era had, and imagination. A lot of creativity went into developing the puppets to look and feel like toys. So that makes it watchable, but not a must-have.I also would have liked to have seen some extras. This thing is bare-bare-BARE bones. There isn't even an on-screen menu!"
1,The Christmas Toy dvd,The movie was one we saw when it was first made back in the 1990's and a Christmas time memory for the boys. We found it on Amazon and received it within a couple of days. Totally thrilled with the product....brought back wonderful memories!
1,Lionsgate get out the dvd business,"You take a classic story and trash it by cutting out important opening and closing scenes. Why bother you cheap dogs. All for an extra buck. Folks the original is fabulous, but what these creeps did to this is shameful. Unless you really have to have this send Lionsgate a message, eat your dvds'."
5,Heartwarming!,"My children are now grown, and I bought this on DVD to have for my grandchildren. I loved this movie when I watched it with my children at the holidays. It's funny, sad and right on about how each Christmas we have that one favorite toy. This became a holiday favorite for our family!"
4,Kermit is GONE!,"Kermit's opening sequence and his introduction to the cast have been edited out. Gone, too, is the entire ""Old Friends, New Friends"" song finale, in which Kermit shows up and joins the cast singing the song. All that's left is a brief chorus heard over the closing credits.For those who have never seen the 1986 original, this will make no difference. For myself and my kids, who fell in love with the original version, this Kermit exorcism is quite sad. Plus, the song finale was an important closing celebration of the show.The DVD transfer is pristine, but one star is missing, in tribute to the missing green frog dressed in a Santa suit. I'm sure there are purist Henson fans who will not be as generous as I.There should be a lump of coal in Disney's stocking this year."
5,About time!,"I have been looking online every year around Christmas time seeing if I can pick up this movie even on VHS (even used VHS tapes were selling for a rediculous price).I watched this movie when I was 10 back when it first came out... such a well done, touching story. Definitely a Christmas classic and I'm glad other's have seen the value and put it on DVD!Thank you, thank you, thank you!!"
5,Favorite Christmas Movie from childhool,This was one of my favorite shows of the season when I was a child. It is never on television and I wanted my kids to be able to watch it like I did.
1,No Kermit.....No thanks....,"Jim Henson would be ashamed. No Kermit....fine. I'll keep my VHS copy, thank you very much."
3,What happened to the end?!,"I loved this movie growing up! I almost had a heart attack when I saw this at Best Buy about a year and a half ago, so I snatched up the last copy. I haven't watched it until tonight and was a little saddened by what happened. The movie ended and that was it. It just kind of, cut off, like the series finale of The Sopranos. I remembered a LOT more to the ending. What happened?! :( Is it going to be rereleased in its uncut glory? Or will I just have to suck it up and deal?"
5,nano,Very good book. To understand it you need to have a lot of knowledge in science. If you like astrophysics then you will like this.
3,Probably Better Then I Rate Them,We bought these to place around the fireplace (much cheaper then the proper hearth edge gaurds). The double stick tape just won't stick to the bricks and the baby loves to pull them off.
2,Great idea-just not for brick fireplaces,"We bought this to put over the brick hearth located in our family room. (We too could not afford the ... gate needed to cover the wide opening). After opening the package I read through the instructions which stated that the double stick tape would not work on brick, but that we would have to purchase strips of velcro to secure to brick. After buying velcro and spending hours installing to brick, dear son pulled off each piece within 5 minutes. Do yourself a favor and forget about these-not worth the [price] and time spent."
3,BYO glue for this series,"Well I bought several of these cushiony covers for the hard edges of my house. My 5 mo old baby pulled them off in about 30 seconds. Not to be outdone, we re-adheared them with ""Shoe-goo"". I considered using superglue, but it doesn't work on foam. Shoe-goo works great. They aren't coming off now! This solution won't work for fireplaces, but it will for other surfaces that you don't care too much about, or that you can sand later to get a good finish again.I will say that once stuck on, they do protect nicely."
1,"Good concept, bad product","My daughter put these cushions on her coffee table to prevent injury to her toddler. It's not a bad idea, but there are some problems with the product. First, even though she made sure the surface was clean and free of any possible dust, dirt or oily residue, the stickum did not hold tight, so her toddler was able to loosen and remove some of the pieces quite easily. The soft, rather spongy material does help prevent injury if a child should fall against it. However, that same material can become a choking hazard to teething babies. My same daughter's year-old twins are now ""cruising"", and found these edge guards delightful to chew on. She decided to stop using the coffee table until the boys outgrow the need to gnaw."
4,Excellent product,Love the product as it fits well onto many furniture items. I brought it for the shoe cabinet and it seems quite stable. Only down part is that if you want to change the position of the protector the tape will not come off easily and gets damaged. So better decide on the position before installing. Happy with the overal product.
5,Works for me!,"I have these on my TV stand and have had them on for 2 years. Work well, my son never tried to pull them off, and they're still sticking with the double sided tape. We are currently putting them on my windowsill. Unless my daughters try to eat them, I think they'll work wonderfully."
4,Maybe even 4.5,"Right to the point, a wholly original film on all levels, and one of Pitt's best. The only thing out place for me is the finale. As the storyline goes, each person guilty of his/her deadly sin was killed for commiting said sin. Exception being Brad Pitt's character guilty of Wrath and yet not killed for his sin. Obviously, I still love this movie and this exception did not ruin it for me. If anyone out there has any feedback or even a different interpretation, I'd be glad to hear it."
3,Not as good the second time round,"When I first saw this film, I was in Madrid, Spain, and I found it just about as shocking as anything I had seen in 20 years of movie-watching. My partner said she was utterly disgusted and never wanted to watch it or anything like it ever again. Three years later, we decided to have another look, and neither of us was particularly shocked or disgusted at all. We just thought that the plot was nothing special and the ending was unconvincing. Which goes to show, movies that specialize in shocking viewers tend not to last as well as movies that concentrate on the basics - good scripts, interesting plots, and an atmosphere that isn't laid on with a trowel."
4,A great movie,"While gory and dramatic this story really bring's to life each individual sin in a new way that has never been done before this movie, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman's acting is really inovating for the time this movie was done."
4,SE7EN is UgLy LikE 13,"""Seven"" carries a dark foreshadowing throughout the whole movie and the ending will leave you shocked. Does this movie take place in Seattle? The gloomy weather provides a morbid atmosphere for a killer who eliminates victims by the seven deadly sins. He has no identity. It might as well be a fallen angel. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are the detectives on his trail and deal with the aftermath of mutilated sins. The glutton guy was plain vile and I lost my appetite forever! Man, even the guy that was strapped to his bed for over a year gave me nightmares for years. This is Brad Pitt's best movie and a great debut for David Fincher. Definitely a classic."
4,A very disturbing thriller.,"Ok, here is a movie that is really hard to review, because of its dark, and very oppresive atmosphere. Brad Pitt, and Morgan Freeman track a serial killer, who murders his victims, by using the seven deadly sins. Weeks after watching this movie it still remains in your mind. The disturbing scenes, and plot are really not easy to forget, and the movie will haut you for weeks to come. Well cast, and directed, Seven does borrow from other movies, such as (The Abominable Dr. Phibes, and even Batman???) Seven does have something to say about life, people, crime, the city, and the way we look at other people, and ourselves. Though not a horror movie Seven still envokes as many chills as any great horror movie. Watch at your own risk!!!!"
3,Great Film - Lackluster DVD,"It goes without saying that the movie is awesome, you can read the other reviews here to find that out. But this DVD edition of Seven is pretty lackluster. You get a trailer, and worst of all - you get to get up and flip the disc half-way through the movie. My advice: hold off and wait for the 2-disc special edition that New Line and director David Fincher are currently working on for release somewhere down the line..."
3,"Fantastic first hour-and-a-half, but then turns sour.","This movie started out great, had a terrific chase scene through an apartment building, and frighting death sequences, but from the scene where the killer walks into the police department with the blood-stained shirt to the very end, the movie goes completely downhill. Still, thanks to a fantastic performance by Morgan Freeman as usual, I think it is worth watching."
1,Utterly Boring and Predictable,"How anyone could watch this film and still speak of a surprise ending is completely beyond me. It was completely predictable, boring, and overly concerned with it's own cleverness.And isn't it about time that someone told Brad Pitt to give up on the acting and just become an underwear model? His rather sad attempts at acting are getting increasingly pathetic, never more so than in this drab waste of time and money."
1,No Redeeming Value,"No matter how much I admire the acting skills of Pitt and Freeman, and no matter how well they portrayed their characters in this flick, the story is too dark, the violence too graphic, the end too depressing. This film has no redeeming value."
2,Kevin Spacey trying to act like John Malkovich?,"That voice was just WAY too much a homage to Malkovich.This movie was interesting enough, but besides the cute premise, there's not all that much here. I think that the three main characters (Freeman, Spacey, Pitt) were misscast and the screenplay missed its own mark. All the dialog was 110% predictable and the characters were too one-dimensional. Freeman did the best job, but Pitt was just a bit too much ""12 Monkeys"" twitchy.Someone below mentioned this already: the titles were better than the movie. Weird. The overall look of this movie is that it was put together by a committee of people more worried about covering their a**es then putting out art. Or even making a lot of money."
3,there is something there but not much,"Yet another movie made from reusable parts of older ones. It is not smart either, just consider an idea that FBI keeps track of all books taken in all libraries and this is the only way to a suspect. However, there is something still in it."
2,"Okay, but don't believe the hype.","A formulaic plot that rises above through good dialog, great actors and great direction.Pitt and Freeman have a great on-camera rapport, and how can anyone not like Gwyneth Paltrow, who is on screen just long enough for us to like her, but not long enough to get annoying.Kevin Spacey is great, but given the way he played the killer, I would have liked more character development. We don't learn enough about him, and what we learn is pretty formulaic.David Fincher is a great director, and I believe after seeing Alien3 and Fight Club that ""Seven"" would probably be very different if he had had total control over it. The mechanics of the film are great, but there is a hollow place in the center that keeps it from being brilliant.A definite first-tier rental prospect, but unless you are a Fincher fan, don't bother buying it."
5,DVD Classic,Seven is an excellent movie about a murder investgation linked to the 7 deadly sins. Acting is excellent and I wanted to add it to my DVD collection(about 75-100). Price was good delivery was fast and the quality of the DVD was excellent.Seven (Single Disc Edition)This is a movie you will want to watch more then once and share with friends for some interesting discussions!
5,Can't give more then 5 stars :(,"Quite possibly the best movie I ever saw. ... just saw this movie again on bbc it's been 2 years or so since I last saw it, it hasn't lost any of it's mood (and movies usually do for me after seeing it more then once/twice) or it's suspence.I always love movies that keep both sides interesting. Movies containing murder tend to make the maniac exactly that, ow yeah they try to make him sound intelligent but they usually fail miserably and fall into the silent whisper/calm voice routine, Spacey takes this to a whole new level actually admitting his mistake and getting pissed off at some point.Appart from the exceptional acting and the interesting and usually ""loaded"" dialogue the plot is the real masterpiece of this movie, I am not a religious person, but I identify with the killer a lot more then I do with the detectives allthough they stay interesting.Anyway, I recommend this movie to everyone"
2,Single Layer Woes,"WARNING!Single layer. Two sides. Mid-film frustration. Do not buy until dual layer is available.Otherwise fine film. I recommend it to all my friends. Until dual layered version comes out, you might as well save a few bucks and get the VHS version. At least then, you won't have to flip it halfway through."
2,Predictable. Overcooked. Brad can't carry it.,"A brilliant opening credit sequence, and downhill from there. Painfully obvious and predictable, with one or two pretty good jolts, to be fair. Morgan Freeman is his usual splendid self, opposite Brad Pitt who is his usual vapid self. What does an actor of Freeman's abilities think as he works with someone of Pitt's ineptness?Lots of fancy dark dank city cinematography and MTV editing to distract us from just how predictable the entire exercise is. You will notice how the police never turn on the lights when they enter a crime scene, presumably because flashlights look cooler, they have that NOIR look, you know? Cool, man.No, not really. Been here, seen it, moved on."
5,"Could easily have received, Se7en points hehehe","Because this is a landmark thriller. I remember sitting through it in a moviehouse in 1995 and it still hasn`t overstayed its welcome. The story, characters and its visual splendour arrests you immediatly and should be in every moviecollection in every household, `round the world."
5,"""Se7en"" Review","I don't give 5 stars easy, but this one was a 5 star movie. It was a honest to god masterpiece. This is probably one of my favorite movies of all time. This was the best thoughtout movie of all time! I recommend this to anyone! (Obviously not young children, but you get the drift.) The twist at the ending will have you stunned!"
4,Atmospheric Psycho Thriller With A Twist,"The Good - Well-acted, atmospheric and stylish - the unexpected turn of events that crescendoed at its climatic ending made ""Seven"" memorable in the same vein as the ingenious ""Identity"" and ""Sixth Sense"".The Not-so-good - Director Fincher took a deliberate stroll over the first three crimes but all too abruptly fast-forwarded the execution of the next four in too haphazard a fashion as soon as the rabbit was out of the pocket ie identity of the killer was revealed. Inevitably, it gave viewers the impression that there was some unfortunate last-minute decision to trim the duration of the movie (and that it was easier to take chunks off the latter part than to re-edit from the beginning) or else the pacing of Seven wouldn't be so off half-way down the road."
4,Surprisingly good crime flick,"Seven is supported by its solid cast, especially Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman---who I find to be a few notches above, for example, Denzel Washington in The Bone Collector. Tracking a serial killer with a peculiar religious motivation, Freeman and Brad Pitt have a nuanced relationship (one could probably find homoeroticism in it) as investigative partners, and each murder is a setpiece in cruelty and methodical retribution. I also appreciated the film's willingness to question the morality of punishment, indeed some of the killings seem in some ways to be hardly malicious at all.The only reason I don't give it five stars is the last scene, which admittedly could be a lot worse. But there is a notable lapse in the movie's tone and a twist which I could see coming a few minutes before it happened. Nonetheless, there is a nice psychological reversal which one rarely sees in today's crime films."
5,"Strong, powerful movie","First, there is so much improvement in this DVD over the previous DVD version, which one had to flip over half way through the movie. The sound and visual quality is also much better. This is a very powerful movie with many cleaver juxtapositioned themes: good and evil, culture and savagery, violence and beauty. The credit sequence in itself is a work of art. The acting is strong, and the script has the potential to shake you to your core. All of these elements, along with Fincher's touch, make this one of the best psychological thrillers around."
4,It still keeps me wet during the nights,"Se7en is an icredible Movie about the Society we live in. david Fincher is a man who knows how to make a story very alive. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman give excellent performances (For not to talk about the murderer) and the Screenplay keeps you interested during the whole Movie (Say another Thriller during the 90s that was so good in overall?). in other words, Se7en is a GREAT! Movie.But why 4 Stars? I give the DVD 4 Stars because it doesn't include the TV Spots and the Audio Commentary with Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and David Fincher was not so good as I thought. It was boring in some places, but despite this. I can still recommend this Flick to DVD Fanatics and David Fincher fans (And they are a lot of you out there)"
5,EXCELLENT!!!!!,"Just a great DVD. Even though Morgan Freeman can ramble a bit during the commentary, it is so insightful that you find yourself listening, rather than watching. An excellent buy and a must have for any DVD collection."
4,Seven DVD Review,"Seven is a well-made crime drama, with an excellent and suspenseful score by Howard Shore. Note: On the back of the DVD case, it is written that the film is presented in 1.85:1 aspect ratio; however, this is not the case. The DVD is presented in 2.35:1 aspect ratio and enhanced for widescreen (16:9) TVs. The picture and sound are of very high quality."
5,"A dark, and brooding classic","An excellent film that lets the viewer know that hooror, and terrow could be living right next door, and or sitting beside you on the bus. No it is not for the faint of heart, or the easily distrubed, but Pitt, and Freeman do a superb job as police detectives playing a game of cat and mouse with a psychotic with a flair for literature. The DVD is excellent, and provides the viewer with tons of extras. Are they needed to enjoy the movie? The answer is of course no, but only fills the desires of the DVD techno-phile. The set is a sort of best-of-both-worlds for average viewer, and true DVD-phile. Rent it, buy it, whichever you prefer, but watch this movie, and remember what it was like to be scared."
4,A great DVD for your collection,"This movie kicks a$$, and is well deserved for a New Line Platnium Edition. There's plenty of commentary from Fincher and the stars, plus deleted scenes, trailers, and alternate endings. My only complaint is that there should have been a ""making-of"" featurette, but this is by far David Fincher's best movie to date."
5,Can't recover from Kevin Spacey,"The movie is so E V I L and B R I L L I A N T.Both director David Fincher and author Richard Dyer are to be put in Jail..! They came up with the best homicidal movie ever to be made. So they are dangerous for the society!Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt did a great job... especailly the facial expressions of Brad Pitt, I cry everytime I see them.And as of Kevin Spacey, he was so convincing that it took me months to recover from hating him for being a PERFECT COLD BLOODED MURDERER.I wish the DVD menus were not so distorted and more eye friendly to be navigated easily.If you haven't seen this film, you are missing so much!"
5,Seven Thumbs Up!,"This movie is incredible! Since it must be viewed with an open mind, this movie is not for everyone. It's dark, gory, and downright disturbing; however, none of that takes away from the fact that it is magnificent. Brad Pitt plays a detective new on the force, and Morgan Freeman plays his partner and mentor. These two men are clearly from opposite ends of the spectrum, which makes the plot even more interesting. Together, the detectives slowly enter the mind of a killer who patterns his crimes after the Seven Deadly Sins. Kevin Spacey plays the insanely psychotic killer who has a surprise twist for the detectives. The climax of Seven is unlike any movie or book out there. It will leave you begging for more. This movie is for anyone that can handle a little bit of gore and a lot of suspense!"
5,ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES ! ! !,"One of the best movies ever. Suspensefull, incredidbly interesting, very mysterious. One of the best. As I always state on my reviews about movies, I'm not gonna say anything about this movie 'cause I know I'll ruin the whole thing for you. But what I AM going to say is that it's one of the best of the best. Dynamite perfomances by MORGAN FREEMAN, BRAD PITT and GWYNETH PALTROW. Great script. Powerfull movie.If you like those movies where it keeps you in full suspense and a very interesting twist at the end, then this one is ment to be watched by you. Go watch it now !!! You won't regret what you will see in those 2 hours of the movie. A true MASTERPIECE ! ! !"
4,Pitt Carries Seven.,"Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman make Seven a must see. There are enough twists and turns to make the story go. Sometimes more obvious than itneeds to be, it still has great acting, solid story line, believeable characters and action."
5,Love it,If you've never seen this movie - buy it. No matter what it costs.. this is a movie worth having. Seven deadly sins sums it all up. Get it.
4,Disc Layout,"Although this is an excellent movie, full of drama and suspense, i noticed one shortcoming of the DVD version after purchasing it....This movie is disturbingly cut into two parts, one half on one side of the DVD and the second half on the other side...it is a bit of a pain to flip the DVD just when the suspense is beginning to build"
5,Fincher strikes again. Best DVD since Fight Club.,"This is an almost-perfect DVD. Great added features, crystal-clear picture, INCREDIBLE sound. This is another DVD that belongs in everyone's collection. It's a testament to David Fincher's ability and dedication as a director that he realizes the job's not done once the film is released in theatres. More directors should put as much time and love into their films as Fincher does.As a film, Se7en is astounding. One of the best, grittiest, darkest films ever made. Pitt, Freeman and Spacey are all teriffic here; some of the best performances I've seen from ANY actors. And David Fincher hit his stride as a director with this film. He has raised the bar for other directors for years to come."
5,The best thriller of the 90s,"Dark, yet it kicks @$$. Reminescent of 8mm. The killer was one sick dude, and Kevin Spacey's excellent portrayal of John Doe is still horrifying to this day. I liked how David Fincher directed this police thriller without a stream of excessive violence. The violence is just at the right level and the films dark style is totally cool. The best dark thriller since 1990's Silence of the Lambs. Get it!!!"
1,Terrible movie,"I'm obviously in a minority here. But IMO the movie just sucked. The thing that irritated me throughout the movie was the darkness and by that I mean the absense of light. The lighting is artificially dimmed for effect and it just doesn't work. Nobody works and lives in such poor light. The black and white film noirs work beautifully, but this movie seems stage-managed. Amongst contemporary movies, the lighting in &quot;Dark City&quot; was very natural and fit in well with the theme of the movie. This is a one gimmick movie and it got old within the first 5 minutes. I count this, along with &quot;Absolute Power&quot; and &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot; as amongst the worst 10 movies I have seen."
3,Way overrated. Average at best,"Cannot believe so many people think this a ""masterpiece"". In what way? You must be out of your screwed-up mind. Overall an very average movie, plot, performance, anything you name it. I don't see much of an intelligence out of this movie. You are drunk, buy it and watch. Otherwise, find something better to watch."
2,Reviews here are overrated,"What do you get when you combined a prominent, experienced cast with an unusual story premise? In this case, a dull movie. A very dull movie, and it didn't have to be that way. The dialogue was insipid and unnecessarily vulgar, the pace painfully slow, and fine actors seemed to be going through the motions. The movie had ""low budget"" written all over it. I watched the film on IFC, standard def, and the color and sound were dreadful, especially the center channel where dialogue was often unintelligible. Someone here reported the latest DVD greatly improves on that. I'll take his word that is true, but it can't make a dull movie interesting."
2,A totally boring movie,"I terribly disappointed by this movie. It bears some resemblance to The Bone Collector and Silence Of The Lamb, but has none of the suspense, mystery, good acting and good story that these other movies have. This lame excuse of a movie ended with with the killer appeared out of nowhere to confess his crime at the end. The cops were basically two idiots who couldn't solve the crime on their own. Add all the stupidities up and you have one boring movie."
1,SE7EN,This movie [disappointed me]! It is boring. You're a whimp if this scared you. Try real horror like The Exorcist!
2,A descent into self-indulgent nihilism,First we're supposed to believe that Matt Damon's character is smart enough (albeit with the guidance of Morgan Freedman's character) to harass and catch a serial killer - and then we're supposed to believe that he's stupid enough to fall for the killer's trap at the end. A grotesque carnival of sickness... a horror movie... not uplifting entertainment.
2,"Tries to be more, but this is a formula film","I know why lots of people liked this film. It has many upcoming stars, like Paltrow, and some established ones who are not too bad (Pitt and Freedman). Then there are the biblical references and the planing of a chess-player style killer. But beyond some frills, is there really anything all that original or interesting? Unfortunately, with the exception of some vivid images and special effects, the answer is no. Moreover, the film is lacking in an original spirit, somethings that sets it apart on a fundamental level. I did not see it and frankly, I hped to find it.Not recommended."
4,Great Movie,"Great Classic Movie. Great Actors. Playback was flawless, no issues. I have the movie in my library for playback. Only wish there was a way to watch it on my andriod tablet, too!"
1,"This is not a review of the bluray book version, but the Canada release Misleading packaging and specs!","Obviously Seven is a great movie but my rating is on the misleading specs. Ok, I wish I had read all the reviews on this before purchasing. The aspect ratio is listed as 2.40:1 when in fact it is 16x9. It is also in 1080i instead of 1080p. Heck the cover isn't even the same one as in the picture. I will be returning this and will buy the bluray book version instead. Blame Canada!"
5,You Must See This,"Much praise has already been heaped on Morgan Freeman and Brad Pit for their exceptional performances in this film. The director has been lauded for the crispness and flow of the narrative and for keeping the viewer on the edge of his/her seat throughout. As a writer myself, I would like to laud the scribe who penned this refreshingly clever masterpiece. How neat, a series of murders based on the seven deadly sins. Ho hum. We sit and wait to see how each sin will be illustrated. Ho Hum. Ah, but what happens when the villain surrenders with two murders (two sins) yet to go? Now the viewer is INTELLECTUALLY engaged . . . for the first time in literally years of watching run of the mill Hollywood thrillers."
3,Great movie...but,"Seven is a great movie. The screenplay, direction, and cinematography are all first rate. There are also some very compelling performances by Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey. But the DVD version has a major flaw...you have to flip it over to watch the rest of the movie. This was not what I expected when I bought this movie, or my DVD player for that matter. Hold out for that rumored re-release where they actually fit the whole movie on one side."
2,Wrong Aspect Ratio !,"I happened to find this title by accident as I was hoping for a U.S. release at some time. Seven was filmed in 2.35:1 aspect ratio, this disc unfortunately has been framed to 1.85:1 or 16:9, shame as you can tell the difference, especially in the grain. Only plus factor on this disc is the DTS-HD Master audio, however if I remember right my New Line DVD edition had a discrete 6.1 soundtrack ! I just hope Criterion bring out their version on Blu Ray just like the old laserdisc silver print edition."
4,"Crisp, Dark Transfer of a Crisp, Dark Movie","This review is for the blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself. The picture is sharp, with a good level of detail. It is a dark transfer, however, with deep black tones and strong contrast. I do not remember the DVD being so dark. Whether this was the director's original vision for the film or simply a darker-than-normal transfer, I am not sure. But it actually works, adding to the gloomy and creepy atmosphere. Some film grain was evident in low-lit scenes, but it did not detract from the sharpness of the picture. The sound was more problematic. On my system, the music occasionally overpowered the dialogue. I had to adjust the settings in order to minimize the score and bring the dialogue to the fore. From that point on, it sounded fine.So should a person who owns the DVD upgrade to the blu-ray? It is a judgment call, but I would say yes for the quality of the visuals. But you might need to adjust the sound some."
3,Great Movie - Terrible DVD,"I love the movie. This article has nothing to do with that. The makers of this DVD should be ashamed of themselves. Only half the movie comes on each side, meaning that during the movie, you have to get up and flip the disc. That is just plain unacceptable. A DVD holds 4.5-4.7 GB per side. Long movies like Pulp Fiction have room so it is hard to believe that Se7en, clocking in at at a measly 127 minutes has to be double sided. Also the widescreen VHS edition of Se7en contains a mini commentary and the theatrical trailer. It is a shame that the DVD contains neither. This is an awfully planned DVD, but salvages some merit in the fact that I still like the movie enough to buy it."
1,very displeased,This is not an original disc of the movie Seven. It will not even play in my area. I have never had an experience like this before and I have purchased DVD on e-bay with no problem. This person is a fake and I don't know what I have received.
2,welcome to the toilet,"I really, really didn't like this movie. Really. It really is an affront to human dignity. Oh of course, it's super-clever, and superbly realised and quite intelligently put together and well-acted and packs a hard punch. I am not denying any of that. What I find so offensive is that this film deliberately co-opts and manipulates the viewer into identifying with and sympathising with darkness. I would almost say that the making of this film verges on being a criminal act against human decency. I am not an old, grey-haired prudish conservative. I'm young, I'm handsome, I'm pretty, I'm intelligent and as cool as they come and I have to say that this is one of the very few films I have watched that has left me feeling morally contaminated. Another reviewer who expressed similar views has received 11 unhelpful votes. I take these to mean - 'shut up and don't spoil the party for the rest of us'. You folks are at one party I don't want no piece of. Good luck to you !"
1,"Movie is great, price is a deadly sin...","You know the movie, so you already have an opinion. My problem is $28 for it?! I keep touting the advantages of blu-ray to others and how new releases are competitively priced and they go and charge $28 for a movie that's over 10 years old. I could maybe understand it if this were an import, but it's not. What gives New Line?"
2,Gross,This film is absolutely gross. It has some of the most disturbing imagery in any modern film. People who are chained to beds and over days have parts of them gradually cut of and the like.Some horror films have elements of the absurd or are poorly constructed so that the repellent features don't seem real. Seven is one of the most well crafted skillfully scripted films made in recent times so that it is absolutely effective.The atmospherics and skill with which it is made cover over the plot holes. I saw the film and found that the imagery kept coming back for weeks and made me feel sick. However if you like that sort of thing there is no question it is effective.
3,SEVEN,"The movie had an erie sence about it, I kept thinking it would improve, but it stays on an even keel of one murder after another for the sake of providing us with the ""Plan"" the murderer has to rack up SEVEN bodies for his twisted plot. I also thought Brad Pitt was too young an actor for the Role, needless to say, I wasn't thrilled."
2,A Horrible Discusting Ending,The good - stimulates your mind about a possible tragity.Th bad - A cut-off-leaving-you-hanging-nightmarish ending.
3,Too much doom and gloom for nothing,"The first time I saw this movie, I liked it a lot. But after seeing snippets of it on TNT about every week, it has started to get old. I have realized that it is pretty much a standard formula film with some creepy music and a lot of foreboding. Especially poorly realized was the killer's motivations...it was as if the movie sympathized with him and actually accepted his reasoning. Please, spare me the psychobabble."
3,why did they do it? double sided dvd?,"whoever oversaw the production of this dvd should be fired...one of the features of dvd is the ability to store more information on one side of a disk, thus leaving me on the couch, not getting up to turn a disk over...but wait a minute...what is that blue screen?...they took one of the best movies of the 90's and ruined the dvd by recording on both sides of the disk...i have not been given a good answer as to why...too bad, this movie was awesome and i would recommend the dvd to no one..."
5,Greatly enjoyed it,The movie came in perfect condition and was great to watch. Made for a great movie night. I recommend for others to see it.
3,Depends on what you like,"If you are used to horror movies then this movie will be nothing for you to watch. For me, it was a bit graphic. I get the point of the seven deadly sins, but it was a bit gruesome in my opinion."
5,One of the best movies I have ever seen!,I found this movie to be brilliant on several levels. First I didn't know the plot prior to seeing the movie. See the review of the blu ray at HDdigest for specs on blu ray. Hope the blu ray lives up to its review.
4,about the movie seven..................,"This DVD film/movie is sold in Singapore videoshops and I grabbed one copy and watched. The story is about an old and new detective that investigate murder case which happen to caught one convict for muder without knowing in the end that the new detective was caught a murderer whom killed many people by the old old detective after he open a package given by one of the post delivery man. Recommended to those whom are interested in this genre of DVD film/movie. What a detective, hey papa is ginging you a ride around town...give me a ten men........written by:(Dr)Ang Poon KahRogue Univesity Professor Certificate.Imagine entertainment for film/movie the Da Vinci Code.Zakkers film director."
5,Best movie I think I have ever seen,"Morgan Freeman portrays the veteran homicide detective, who is partnered with Brad Pitt who shows up at the first murder scene. This scene just barely sets the stage for all of the twists and turns that this movie throws at you. The brilliance of the writting of this movie is second to none. It shows you all of the emotions of the characters, from the bottom of the heart love all the way through complete and total anger. The way the killer is protrayed is just another aspect of brilliance of this movie. The clues that are left behind, as well as where they are left is just mind blowing.This DVD is also jammed full of features that just make this DVD a MUST HAVE for movie buffs. I gave this movie 5 stars for the simple fact that 10 stars is not on this list. This is a movie that I would make my own parents put a $30.00 deposit on to borrow from me."
2,too many false notes,"Whoever heard of a serial killer killing for the reasons given in this contrived flick?No reason to blame the actors here; they didn't write it, they didn't direct it.There is one great chase/fight sequence in the film, and the art direction is terrific...otherwise, this thing lacks plausibility.Interested in seeing a great serial killer movie? See Maniac starring Joe Spinnel, or see Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer--or even Monster, starring Charlize Theron."
2,Stupid Silence of the Lambs Wanna Be,"Caught this on TV. Awful. Maybe it was good in another time period (1995) when Silence of the Lambs was still on the audience's mind.It's a mix of a Silence wannabe with an attempt at a 1970s Taxi Driver/Conversation overlay (too many dang saxophones and trenchcoats). It works with Morgan Freeman, but not with Brad Pitt whose essential 90s-ness jumps out at you. Kevin Spacey underplays it in an attempt to be another Hannibal. He is not successful.There are plot holes galore. The clues don't add up and the suspense doesn't build in the same way they did with Agent Starling. Things happen and you aren't sure why. Gwenyth Paltrow's character asks Morgan Freeman to lunch for no discernible reason and this later becomes a key plot element.Just a really stupid movie. As far as pure horror/suspense, the sloth guy tableau was the only one that got a jump out of me."
1,Are we THAT numb to enjoy such terrible writing?,"This movie is weak, poorly written and has some laugh-out-loud stereotypical cop-schlock dialogue. The acting is sub-par for such a wonderful cast. How numb are we to poor writing that we accept such drivel? I'm amazed at the way people compliment this film. Really- Deep? Symbolic? c'mon! This is film is as about as deep as a kiddie pool."
2,Bells & ..................,"After checking out a myriad of ""must haves"" in DVD, I bought the recommended, and after having enjoyed the theatrical release, and credits, watched terrible dialogue and sloppy moments throughout. After the terrific credits the film is just flim-flam despite photography and actors. Just style !!!...a remake of regurgitated ideas from ""Taxi Driver"" /the detective side. Stick with ""Law & Order"" on any night. Loved the credits!!!Considering it was in New York, when can you simply travel to the desert in 1/2 hour..........? Or give a dinner party, and then explain to the guest AFTER dinner that your apartment is over a subway?"
5,Se7en is a chiller that will stay with you forever!,"If you think that you are going to sit in your cozy little chair and watch a movie tonight, then turn on the lights and turn off the VCR! This movie will rock you from the darkness of the scenes to the ending that will shock you. Please don't take this lightly, as Pitt and Freeman will lead you into a world that will make you think. Watch with the lights on, if needed. Figures that the same genius that wrote Se7en scribed the screenplay for 8mm with Nicolas Cage. Enjoy!"
3,"a great film, but a flawed DVD...","truly a brilliant, *dark* piece of filmmaking. in particular, the small details of the Dt. Sommerall character (he sleeps with a running metronome, he has a switchblade fetish) make a great impact.as much as i liked the film itself, i have to say that i was disappointed with the transfer to DVD. the video image, while crisp, would occasionally ""stutter"", as if the projector were skipping a few frames. also, in the scene in the killer's apartment, the audio drops out for a moment. both of these problems got in the way of enjoying a magnificent film.don't even get me started on how annoyed i was at having to flip the disc halfway through the movie..."
3,"Great movie, nice transfer, but have to turn it over!","I like this movie very much; it's the best serial killer story since Silence of the Lambs. The picture quality on this DVD is very good, but I was disappointed to know that only half of the movie was on each side. It's like going back to having a laser disc without the auto turn-over feature. I wish I would have known this before buying this edition- I would have waited for the ""all on one side"" version to come out. It's a great inconvenience for those who like to see a film in its uninterrupted splendor, but also for those film fanatics who like to be able to jump to any seen throughout the movie at will."
1,Seven,"I thought Morgan Freeman(Ironically a Cheater himself years later in real Life) and Brad Pitt(on a roll) did their part good,the story is unique but overall I found the movie disturbing and over the top when it came to the mayhem, on top of that you have Kevin Spacey(someone I detest and always plays the bad guy so it is fitting). My problem doesn't lay with the story but the way it carries itself in total disgust."
4,Crime/Mystery with a Philosophical Twist,"Directed interestingly, acted well, written heavy-handedly. Aside from the use of color, the directing has nothing on any other high budget action movie. Of course, these are well directed for their purpose. Morgan Freeman acts very well, Paltrow acts as she always does, and Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt. He wasn't always convincing, but this I'll blame on the writer giving him an impossible, unconvincing character. The writer was preaching, and he preached an interesting movie. But if you want to see the same message preached more intelligently, watch David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet."" To give ""Seven"" its due, it preaches less blatantly than BV, but also less brilliantly. In the end, it is slightly more intelligent than the average big budget movie, but it is not perfect. It's worth watching, maybe twice, but not buying."
3,A disturbing movie.,"A madman is on the loose, he is killing people in a sinister fashion. The city assigns two cops a older Black cop, and a white Hot shot cop.The gist is that the murdering is killing each person to represent one of the Seven deadly sins.The movie was well filmed, and almost has a noir felling about it.The ending is truly disturbing I must warn you.On to the DVD itself. THe tranfer was done quite well. Sound is good. There are effectively zero features. Yes there is a trailer and yes there is a Bio of all the stars, but I really have begun to expect more from a DVD."
3,GOOD BUT........,"THE STORYLINE OF SEVEN IS VERY GOOD, BUT, FOR EXAMPLE SAVING PRIVATE RYAN IS OVER 3HRS. LONG ON ONE SIDE OF THE DISC PLUS A LOT OF THE OTHER STUFF THAT COMES WITH THE MOVIE. OKAY ... SEVEN IS ONLY 127 MIN WITH NO EXTRA STUFF, BUT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE DISC SO YOU HAVE TO FLIP IT OVER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE ... WHY? I THINK THAT IS REALLY STUPID."
4,Disturbing and Scary!,"Disturbing and scary don't seem like good enough words to describe the film, ""Seven"". This movie is a psychological thriller in which a serial killer kills his victims by using the seven deadly sins: pride, envy, gluttony, lust, anger, greed, and sloth. Of course you're disturbed by the killings and dark, damp feel of the movie, but you also learn about the message that the killer was ultimately trying to relay - although he didn't have to kill to get his point across.Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman did great jobs playing the lead characters, and Kevin Spacey is chilling as the killer. This is definitely a movie you want to watch with a friend and with the lights on!"
5,A chilling look into the mind of a genius killer.,"Kevin Spacey's portrayal of pshycopathic murderer John Doe is a truly disturbing view of vigilante killers that thrive in todays ingorance. What is truly frightening about the movie is that as you listen to Doe speak about his motivation, you begin to understand his thought process and can almost sympathize with him. It offers a disturbing glance into one's own mind as you begin to relate to what is once thought of as a psychopath."
2,They need to remaster this disc,"As many have said before, Seven is a great movie.Unfortunately, Seven is also an extremely poor DVD. Not only is the disc a flipper, requiring you to turn the disc over mid-film, it includes absolutely no extras. Granted this disc was produced in a time when RSDL-capable mastering plants were scarce, but that is not the case now. There is absolutely no reason why a disc of such poor quality is allowed to remain on the market"
1,Never Received the Book!,"We never received the book, sad to say. It was for a young man for his college class. After waiting for three weeks, he was dropped from the class. The price of a new book was very expensive and out of his price range, so his grandfather was purchasing a used copy for him. I order frequently from Amazon books and have never had this problem."
1,Horrid,"This is a horrible text book, if you got all the way to college you will already know all this. there is no real useful information here for college students."
1,Not as accurate as Clear Blue Easy (for me),"I bought these because they were less expensive than my previous month's supply of Clear BLue Easy Ovulation tests. My cycle is pretty regular..27-28 days. These registered as negative for 2 days before ovulation. I had one Clear Blue Easy test left and I tried that one (CBE) immediately after one of these, it was positive! I'm not sure if I got a pack of ""duds"" or if these aren't as sensitive as the Clear Blue Easy brand.There was a very faint line, but not as dark or darker than the control line. Which under the instructions on the website indicates that it is a negative test. I don't think I'll buy these again! I will say, shipping was super fast!"
3,Not a bad cheap test.,"I tried these and my only complaint is that even when positive the line isn't much different then the test line. It is clearly not as dark when negative and I used BBT to verify ovulation. The tests do work and are easy to use. No instructions are included in the package but a web site is given on the invoice that has them.One little tip...I tried was using them as a mid stream since I find the whole cup thing a bit unsavory. I found I was able to do it and get the same results regardless. I don't know what the manufacturer would say to that, but it saves money on using the mid stream version of the test."
4,"Good product, not so efficient delivery","The product itself was great, easy to use and very reasonably priced. I would hesitate to order these again from this distributor and Amazon however, because of the length of time it took to receive the product. Not at all prompt, as advertised, and I was able to find another site online that had the same pricing, but with much more efficient delivery."
1,"Cheap, inaccurate and misleading","I'm using these along with the saliva microscope, checking cervical mucus, and basal temp charting to pinpoint ovulation. I have PCOS so I'm very irregular and unpredictable. These cheap sticks are just that. I've tried using them all times of the day (even more than once in a day) and the control line is 9 times out of 10 very light. Sometimes I get a faint test line, but most of the time it looks as if it's negative. I know it's not negative because of the other testing I'm going. I wouldn't waste your money on these cheap things. They're very disappointing and discouraging to someone trying to conceive. Maybe I got a bad batch? I don't know, but definitely will not waste my money on these again."
1,Ovulation strips did not work,I tested from cd 10 to cd 28 and I never saw a positive. I think you get what you pay for and I will never purchase again. I would rather spend the money to find out if I am ovulating instead of just guessing. It was a waste of money and time.
1,Not what I had expected...,"Yes, they are inexpensive, but, they do not send instructions with them and they aren't as accurate as they claim. I have been taking my basal temperature faithfully every morning, had a spike 2 days ago and still these OVT's didn't show a positive result. Don't waste your money, you'll get pregnant with or without the worry of whether or not you've ovulated-eventually."
5,Pure Foot Bliss!,"I have many different pairs of shoes, and THE one I always think of when I think of comfort are these babies! These shoes look great too. This pair of shoes made me purchase several other Clark brand shoes, all of which pale in comparison. If you want a nice casual to dressy shoe, this is the one for you! 5 stars all the way!"
2,Not much modifying,"This book is virtually identical (same diagrams and pics) as the mopar magnum manual. About 90+% of the book entails taking a magnum apart and putting it back together. The next 5-8% or so covers the bolt on performance products for the magnum. The only ""modifying"" I could find in this book was the small section on cylinder head porting (of course with no pics/diagrams) and an oil pan baffle. I know Larry is smarter than this. He has put out some very good information in the past. I dont know if this a contract conflict with Mopar that he doesnt put out this sort of information or what, but this book wasn't very helpful. I would suggest a website forum over this book any/every day."
3,How To Modify Your Magnum V-8,"This book is like the other Larry Shepard mopar small block book. It's okay, but needs more detail. Since Larry was an engineer at Chrysler, he only explores building the engine with Chrysler parts. I wish there was more detail on porting heads, oiling system mods, rocker arm selection and more. It is good to have it to use with other books for building a small block Chrysler, but I would not use it as a sole guidebook."
3,a good book for the less experance mopar fan,"i grow up around the dodges from the time i can remember. i was looking for something to tell me more about other people veiws. it didn't tell me anything that i didn't already know. for someone with less experance it get be very helpful. but larry does right another book on mopars ""how to rebuild mopar magnum"" and should buy that one first to fully understand the basics."
4,More Mopar Ponies,"Even though this book is not a direct sale from Amazon, the second party seller got this book to me in good time. I have not had a chance to go through it, one of these days I will be able to use the book to plan how to get more mopar ponies."
3,"Very good, should have been great.","A movie is only great when the bad guy is a star. I forget his name but the chief bad guy is unpleasant in every way except he is non-threatening. Lee Van Cleef in the earlier Eastwood movies would make your blood curl as the chief nemesis. Still, a good time is had and nothing beats Eastwood in a marshall's uniform. Eastwood is always 100% convincing in his parts."
5,i love the classics,this movie is one of my all time favorite westerns. clint eastwood at his best. i am very thankful this dealer had this in stock and sent it to me asap. thank you so much
4,Better as a study than as a film,"The Bottom Line:The Western genre is inextricably linked to the nature of justice and in this regard Hang 'Em High, the story of a wrongfully-lynched man who survives and seeks to avenge the crime of his hanging, is a complete success; however, in terms of sheer enjoyment it falls considerably behind movies like The Good the Bad and the Ugly or The Outlaw Josey Wales, so if you don't dig the justice themes and just want more action look elsewhere.3/4"
1,Lousy quality Blu-ray,"As a spaghetti fan, this movie has a poor plot. But aside from that, I might as well have stuck with the DVD. The transfer to Blu-ray is grainy and ill defined. And of course the sound is mono. Don't bother."
4,LIfe,"I Love this movie. The story of a man who, by the way of life's circumstances, finds his way Back into where he was meant to be. The underlying story is often missed by most."
3,nice one,"one of his best american westerns. three stars compared with the dollars trilogy, which gets an averaged out 4.5 stars from mesoothing pace. better than high plains drifter which is in my opinion just a imitation leone ripp-off."
2,Not Clint's Best,"Predictable story, poor quality DVD. It could have been a glitch in my disc, but I had a fuzzy picture (esp. during close-ups) and really bad sound. For ex. the volume had to be turned way up to hear the voices but when the music came in it blew you out! I'm goint to give the blame to MGM for that because I have ""The Searchers"" on DVD, which is a much older movie, and the picture and sound is much better. As for the story itself, the movie ends unfinished. What about the girl, or the rest of the bad guys? Watch and you'll see for yourself. Or don't watch: Get ""High Plains Drifter"" or ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" if you want to see Clint at his best taking on the western frontier and flat out kickin' some a--."
4,Classic Eastwood western with Hawai'i Five-0 influence from Prodcr. Len Freeman and actor James MacArthur,"Not your average garden variety revenge-Western either. Eastwood did act WELL inhere, not just got through the motionslike in High Plains Drifter (**) and aw-ful Beguiled (*.5), or even worse 'Un-forgiven' (*.5). Pat Hingle, also a vetof four Hawai'i 5-0 episodes did well inhere as 'Hang'Em High' judge who givesClint his Sherrif star. Stevens, who be-came a nut later is good in here, too."
2,If Only,"I reckon I'd really like to have seen this movie directed by Sergio Leone and the score written by Ennio Morricone. As it is, it just doesn't pack the wallop or capture the grandeur of the ""spaghetti"" westerns and is one of my least favorite westerns. The score alone is enought to make me gag; it could have been written for some cheesy made-for-TV movie or even one of the later Gunsmoke episodes. Clint does a decent enough job but doesn't look nearly as tough without a beard. The script is predictable and just doesn't have any air of mystery about it like Eastwood's previous work. A real disappointment."
4,"Excellent western, but mediocre transfer...","""Hang 'Em High"" (1968) is directed by Ted Post (Magnum Force, The Harrad Experiment, Beneath the Panet of the Apes). Clint Eastwood stars as Jed Cooper, a man who is lynched by a gang even though he was innocent of the accusations of murder and cattle rustling. When Jed manages to survive the hanging and is subsequently freed of any crimes he enlists as a US Marshal and hunts down the gang that lynched him. The film itself pits Jed's moral views of justice and fairness against the backdrop of the harsh morality as served by Judge Adam Fenton (Pat HIngle) at Fort Grant.The film entertains us even as it tells us a story about courage and varying opinions about morality.The blu-ray has not been remastered, and has many instances of dust. Also, the clarity of the images are not much better than a dvd, and sometimes the color is off and lacks saturation, but overall the film is quite watchable."
4,How on Earth does this have a Bluray transfer and not...,"I love this movie, it was a lot of fun.What I want to know is how on Earth modest old Hang 'Em Up has gotten the Blu-ray treatment but these haven't...- Once Upon a Time in the West- For a Few Dollars More (Not outside the trilogy)- A Fistful of Dollars (Not outside the trilogy, and it's severely cropped)- A PROPER The Lord of the Rings transferIt's criminal. Is MGM trying to make Western fans' heads explode? It's cruel and unusual punishment I swear!"
1,Hang 'Em High,"the vhs ""Hang 'Em High"" was not in good condition. After the beginning there was no picture. Very dissapointed. It did'nt even rate 1 star. The company was fair in returning my money."
1,"Certainly not a ""fistful of dollars""",Boring and predictable. A let-down after the trilogy and the High Plains Drifter.
2,Waste of money,"This is a waste of money. I found it boring and dated; rent it instead.If you want a DVD, buy ""The man with no name trilogy.""It's a little better, but still questionable as to whether it's worth the money!"
3,"Expected more, got less","Not a bad book, but I wouldn't recommend it unless a reader is already familiar with some of Walter Mosley's other books, as he's got many much better better writings out there. Both the plot and characters were a bit too stereotyped and the novel focused way too much (to the point of being unbelievable) on race. Having enjoyed several other books by Mosley, I expected a lot more from him."
4,GREAT BOOK,This was my first time reading Walter Mosley and I have to say that i was very impressed by it being such a quick read and i found myself not wanting to put it down. The characters and story line really made you think how our own personal situations are never as bad as we think. There is good in any situation if you are just willing to look for it. This book would make an excellent disney or halmark movie minus the somewhat unnecessary sex. But thumbs up anyway Mr Mosely. Great summer read.
3,too stereotypical and too much sex,"On the positive side, this novel kept me interested and drew me forward. It also really made me think about how morality bends in difficult situations.But from the beginning, the stereotypes really bothered me:White boy got everything.Black boy ain't got nothin'.And it pretty much goes like that. White people are all advantaged and take it for granted. Blacks are nearly all poor, often angry, drunk or high. The one Asian imparts wisdom.And everyone is jumping into bed and doing it. There's so much sex. At one point, a character is in a coma and imagines having sex with a dead person who comes back to life! I mean, give it a rest."
5,The Best I've Read in Years,This is clearly the best book I've read since Clarence Major's My Amputations. It is simply a must read and an absolute classic.
5,Best by Mosley,"A moving, emotional and captivating story about family. You know that saying blood is thicker than water, its not true. For a long time I've known that family is what you as an individual define it as, not who you are born to or how you are born. This story is about a family, truth, knowing who you are and that your future and how you live it is all up to you. This story about two brothers, who are not brothers, shares with us the true meaning of brotherhood and what it really means. I haven't been touched by a book in a very long as I've been moved by this, Mr. Mosley's finest piece of literature. Mr. Mosley has penned a narrative that says who ever in this life, you decide to call family, its a very good thing. Take it, keep it and be proud of it. Just read it and you'll understand."
5,It's a solid one,"This book broke my heart. I found my self getting mad, sad, laughing and having my own desires for the lives of the people in the book. It is a book where you have to be willing to live with the people and care about them and I loved that.I choose this book after reading Potlomey Grey (which is another awesome book by Mosley)and I was not disappointed. Two books in a row by the same author and being able to love reading both of them is a rarity these days. I am glad to see that among so much riff raff and chaff that Mosley continues to deliver solid works."
4,A very emotional book:,"Walter Mosley is one of my favorite writers. I have enjoyed a lot of his novels, this one no different.This book was full of emotions and was a little hard to get through at times. I'm glad I did though, it was well worth it.Walter Mosley has a very raw writing style that really sets him apart from other writers. He doesn't hold back, and brings things out in his characters, that other writers could only hope to achieve.Enjoy this book, just be ready for an emotional experience.Happy reading."
1,Just didn't work on my dog :-(,"After reading all the reviews, I was very hopeful this product would help my Boston Terrier's, ummm, flatulance that runs me out of the room. I noticed some reviews talked about insatiable appitites being supressed, a decrease in hair loss as well as less ""stinkyness""-which my Boston has all these lovely qualities. I have doubled the dose in hopes of this enzyme working and I haven't has ANY luck as others have. I'm very happy other pet owners have found this product to be a great supplement-I guess my search continues :-("
4,"Good product, good price!",We have been using this product for several years on our small breed dogs. It seems to do a great job keeping their coats healthy and their skin from getting dry.
3,Rodi's first - but not his best,"I've read all but one of Robert Rodi's books (Drag Queen). This one isn't as good as Closet Case but still entertaining. Natalie is the title character, a fat girl in love with the perfect Peter, who can't seem to keep a boyfriend. She's happy living her life with him, until he meets a right-wing libertarian....Like most of his books, the main characters who are straight are less than admirable, while the gay ones have only a few flaws. But don't let that turn you off - this book is still an amazingly funny work. Very easy to picture everything in your mind, quick page-turner, lots of fun to read."
2,Didn't Work...,I purchased this product for my husband. He took it as directed for several months and saw no improvement.
1,Another dissapointment...,This is the second tinnitus product I've tried hoping it might work. It's just another dissapointment and more money down the drain. What really makes you feel stupid is the warranty. Product takes 3 to 6 months to work but only has a 30 day warranty. Daaaaa Well someone is laughing all the way to the bank.
2,Waste of money.,Did not notice any difference after taking this product for me.Was just a waste of money in my opinion.
4,Not Perfect,"It is not perfect -- I stil have some tinitus -- However, it does reduce the ear noise to a more acceptable and functional level."
3,Can't really tell,Can't really tell if Ringstop helps with the ringing or not. It may have other attributes outside of the published.
4,There's no cure,Tinnitus is an awful problem. Rings top seems to make a difference when take as instructed over a 3 to 6 month period.
2,Ring Stop Still Waiting,well I have double dosed the ring stop for 90 days still have the ringing with no change in pitch.
5,Wonderful Product,"After several years of having problems with my ears - ringing, dizziness, feeling of fullness, pain, I purchased Ringstop. The problems have vanished after taking the pills for only a few days. There are no side effects and I feel great. Thank you Ringstop -- you have given me my life back!"
3,"""Quality Coutura Watch""","I received the watch without a box, paperwork etc. The watch was clearlyused several scratches, I tried to return the watch but the companynever responded. I elected to contact my States AG's Office to filea complaint, no word yet. Amazon should screen it's vendors better sosomeone else does not fall to my demise."
4,Seiko Coutura Men's Gold Tone Steel Watch SPL008,"Very nice watch. But, it's heavy. It's will be very nice. If, people make it by Titanium, and everything stay at the same (Seiko Coutura Men's and Women's Gold Tone Titanium watch)."
4,Great book but skip some of the language interps not useful and boring,I loved the book. Weird and interesting things that happen in another country keep the story going.
4,A moving and amazing story,My counsellor at summer camp started reading this book to some of the fasters on T'isha B'av (a Jewish fast day) while the younger kids were having their meals. It really touched me and was also very interesting because my camp is very Israel oriented. We never got to finish at camp but when i got home I bought it and read the rest. I think it is an amazing portrayal of life and love and should be read by everybody.
2,"Political commentary, not love story","I agree with the reviewer who called this a one sided fairy tale. It is! I would have put this book down after the first chapter if not for my interest in the Hebrew language and Ravel's decision to include Hebrew etymology woven into the story. (Granted had it been any other language, I would have REALLY put the book back on the shelf). Ravel's political leanings are clear in this story and really frustrate me because someone with less knowledge of the situation would really get the wrong idea!"
4,Terrific first novel,"Ten Thousand Lovers was recommended to me by a person at Monroe Bookstore in Victoria, B.C. as a good example of recent Canadian fiction. The truth is this first novel is completely based and focused on Israel. The love story is touching. I share the view that the politics are simplistic. Still, they have a ring of truth and as a person who is strongly pro-Israel I felt it was important for me to read this book. I don't think the erratic movement from present to past was particularly effective. At times I felt I was reading a romance novel. That being said, I read it in its entirety in almost one sitting because I found it absorbing. I certainly would recommend it to others. I look forward to reading more of Ravel's fiction in the future."
4,Ten Thousand Lovers by Edeet Ravel.,"Set in the seventies, the novel demonstrates the political landscape of the newly formed Israel, through its citizens and their personal and professional lives. They are constantly coping, separating/distancing themselves, waiting for disaster.With the title, Ravel reminds the reader to look beyond the central story. This is the story of one lover, but also ten thousand lovers. It is the story of one couple, but thousands of couples feel this way. In a country that encourages distance for protection, the love of Ami and Lily is bound through intimacy and closeness with each other and with the land.A very good read -- hard to put down. I cried!"
2,Not very high quality.,"I don't mind these blankets, but they certainly are not what I expected. They are very small, not very soft and really are only patterned on one side. I wouldn't consider them to be receiving blankets so much as burp cloths or something like that. I have some other cotton and fleece receiving blankets that are just lovely, but these I would maybe only use when the baby was very tiny and needed to be wrapped in something very light, or as I mentioned before use them for burp cloths."
1,Spend the extra few dollars for somthing better!!,"My husband and I registered for the Wamsutta receiving blankets and picked this type because of the quality brand name and due to we were satisfied with our adult bedding from Wamsutta. When I opened the package it was already too late to return the item due to it's only in a plastic wrap, I was upset to see the poor quality, thin and chintzy fabric and also skimpy size. If I'd known better I would have picked another brand. If they are already small now how will they be when I wash them????"
2,Too small to swaddle baby,"Unlike other reviewers, I wasn't too upset by the quality of these blankets (I live in a hot climate and like the fact that they're thin), but was unable to use them to swaddle my baby because they're much too small. I now use these blankets as burp clothes and as head supports for my baby rather than to swaddle...sort of defeats the purpose."
3,Useless for swaddling,"We bought these blankets thinking it was a great value for 5 recieving blankets, the problem is they are way to small to swaddle our son in. We now use them as burp clothes or to keep him warm around the house or in his carseat. The are very soft and hold up well in the wash."
4,Great for swaddling!,"As 30x30 receiving blankets go, these have worked great for swaddling our 12-lb 2-month old. They're soft and stretchy enough to securely wrap him up, and they've held up to weekly washings."
2,I should have heeded other parents' advice...,"I saw that other parents were disappointed, but decided to get these blankets anyway, because normally Wamsutta has excellent quality. They are soft, but the first time I washed them, they changed shape, and loose threads sprung out from every corner. Size wasn't a problem, because I have premature twins, but if I want to hold them both under one blanket, I have to use the Carter's blankets. I guess the moral is .... you get what you pay for."
2,These Are Awful,"After you wash them the first time, they get crooked and uneven trapezoid-shaped. Try folding those and having them look and fit nicely in the drawer. There are three brands at Babies R Us, this one, Gerber, and I think it is Koala Baby... they are all better than this brand."
2,wamsutta receiving blankets,"We really didn't care for the small size or lack of softness of these blankets. Of course, they're ok for placing our son on during changes and while in his bassinet. The patterned printed blankets kept a 'crusty' feel even after repeated washing. Buy Cheap-Buy Twice...."
3,Great blankets!,"These blankets are so soft and come in adorable patterns. They are great for swaddling small infants. Because they are smaller than Carter's receiving blankets, they fit nicely in diaper bags."
3,It's OK,"I do agree that they do not hold up well in the wash, even in cold water, although, I do have very hard water, so I'm unsure how they do in softer water. They did frey a bit on the edges, but I did find them quite soft and I chose to use them as ""draping"" blankets in the summer/fall when it was a little chilly, but not too bad. Nice to have in the car or even to drape over car seat or baby while outside if it's a bit windy."
2,Get out your magnifying glass,"Annual awards recipients' biographical material as always appetizing and interesting. However, the following sections depicting current work focus on first-person design-incantations rather than the work. Due to smaller format (reduced dimensions) it's difficult to see the work examples and all nuance is for the most part completely lost.A surprising amount of lengthy unilluminating explanatory text.A very odd section attempting to illustrate very simple survey results in a bizarrely complex manner.I can't use this book as a design reference as I do with previous AIGA annuals, so I'm going through the bother of returning it."
4,The Best Defense of the Majority Text,"W. Pickering gives a logical defense of the Majority text. His argument for the superiority of the Majority text is professionally laid out and is technical enough to satisfy any accademic readers. Pickering, having taught textual criticism on the seminary level, is well qualified to write such a technical book."
4,Traditional Text supported,This is a great book. In discussions i find myself mentioning Pickerings cone of distritution. The cone is both pictograhic and mathematical in explaing how a manuscript is distributed. It really points out the preposterousness of the critical text being the original. Despite pickerings great analysis of the traditional text he has a statistical section that helps us understand how the tradtional text is distributed and created. Pickering is a linguist so he approaches the discussion from a competant and realistic view of he traditional text. i liked the book and refer to it often in my discussions regarding textual support for the traditional text.
5,NT Text,My husband wanted this book in his personal library for his own biblical research.He likes the book very much.
3,NOT MY FIRST CHOICE NOW,"I BOUGHT ONE, DIDN'T USE IT UNTIL TODAY. POORDESIGN, HARD TO CLEAN. WORKS OK, BUT VERY LIGHTWEIGHT, HARD TO KEEP A GRIP ON MEAT TO SLICE DUETO CRAPPY SAFETY GRIP. NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN USEOFTEN AS YOU CAN ONLY RUN FOR 5 MINUTES BEFOREOVERHEATING. AGAIN CLEANING IS AWFUL. I'VE USEDSLICERS, YOU BREAK THEM DOWN, CLEAN & REASSEMBLE,NP. NOT THIS ONE."
1,How to save 99 bucks!!,"Use a knife, it works and it works better than this paper weight.If you did in fact buy this piece of junk, here's how you can actually make it work like a professional food slicer.(no, really don't try this)First, remove the bladeSecond, attach it to your power mitre saw you have in the garage.Third, watch your fingers when holding the meat.orIf you have to give a gift to someone you don't like then this is perfect.Otherwise, send it back or take it back!"
5,Great XMAS Gift,Delivered on time. Was shipped as a XMAS Gift and was not damaged. Recipient was pleased and the item works perfectly.
1,Unfortunately I have to agree with the majority here,"After paying over $100 for a food slicer, I expected it to last. It broke down after the second use and is irreparable. Like one other person said on here, it just started to smoke, then the engine kept whirring but the blade didn't move. I wish I could have found the paperwork to return it because the gear is completely stripped out and they don't offer that part as a replacement, so I just wasted $100 on something that will simply go to the scrapyard. It's also very difficult to clean. I was extremely disappointed in this slicer and would not be able to recommend it to anyone."
1,Talk about bad product design...,"Giving 1 star to this food slicer is actually quite generous and only happened because Amazon doesn't have a 0 rating.This food slicer is basically worthless for any use, for hygienic reasons: there is lubricant on the inside of the blade that gets spread over food. Cleaning the blade and/or the inside of the blade compartment is impossible, as the blade carries a gear on the back that sits on another gear that connects to the motor. Because of this, the gears need to be lubricated and the blade gets greasy all over.It's also impossible to slice anything slightly bigger than a roll, since the plastic hand guard can only be placed on the sliding tray in one position. If you have a <gasp> full bread, good luck slicing it! The same goes for salami, etc.Guess when I'm going to buy another Waring Pro product in the future."
2,Hard to clean!,"This product, as others have indicated, is very difficult to clean. I cannot recommend it. :("
5,Great Value for the price!,"This slicer exceeded our expectations -- especially with some of the reviews out there. The first thing we did was to take the blade off to see how difficult it would be to clean. To our surprise it unscrewed right off and went back on like a charm. We then tried slicing. We sliced various thicknesses of smoked sausage, then cheese, and finally thinly sliced ham. Everything was perfect. What a deal for the price! We would highly reccommend this slicer. The only ""draw-back"" is the knob that adjusts the thickness of the slicer -- it is all black -- the numbers and the indicator line would be easier to read if they were white and not black like the rest of the know (a little white fingernail polish will fix this)."
1,Bad Design,We have had this slicer for a couple years and used it about 10-15 times. I have replaced the inner plastic seal behind the blade housing twice and will not replace it again. It's very difficult to clean thoroughly. I would not recommend this appliance and we will look at another manufacturer for a replacement.
5,Works fine for me!!!!,"I've read through most reviews here and was shocked to hear everyone's difficulty with cleaning / removing the blade etc. All I can say is I use this thing almost every day for slicing meats, cheese, veggies (tomatoes are the best) and even fresh baked bread and love it! It is not perfect and cannot compare to a professional deli slicer by any means and at times I wish the blade did spin a little faster for a cleaner cut but for under $100 you get what you pay for and I think for most it should be fine. As far as the cleaning goes, at first I was a little intimidated because I have heard horror stories with this and other slicers taking A LONG time to clean but I feel this is one of the easiest appliances to clean once you get the hang of it. The blade removes easily without tools (I think older models were different) and the rest of the machine you just wipe clean with a rag or sponge and dry for storage (or if your like me it will become one with your kitchen counter)."
1,Junk,"After six uses, this unit broke. I smelled motor smoke the next to last time I used it, then the internal linkage broke and the motor just ran very fast. The unit did slice fairly well but the user required some strength to use the device. Also the suction cups did not hold the unit still on my counter top. Do not buy this!"
4,Waring product excellent for home use,"Waring slicer very good product for home use and for the price; fairly easy to clean, although any slicer is going to be difficult to clean thoroughly (and they all need to be cleaned thoroughly); strong motor,I anticipate some of the plastic gears may have to be replaced in future, but I think that all of these home slicers seem to use plastic gears. Only concern is with the plastic gears. Why not include one set of plastic gears in each package, or use another material? Shouldn't cause a major price increase."
5,Waring fs150 food slicer,I am very happy with this food slicer. It performs wonderfully. It is easy to clean. It is paying for itself everyday because now I can cook my own roasts and meats and slice them myself ... result fresher lunch meats and no preservatives!
2,"sliced well, impossible to really clean","The machine sliced a roast beef pretty well. However, clean-up was impossible. There was no way to remove the meat & juices that fell inside the machine."
4,had it a year..,I've had this unit for a year. My background is in professional food prep and I have used a commercial unit for many years. I will admit to being slightly surprised at the GOOD performance of this product. It's not bad at all! I make beef and other jerky and I love this machine. Also wonderful for turkey and roasts. Easy to make a great presentation with foods sliced nicely! Clean up really isn't THAT bad!
1,"Disappointed, but got happy","I bought this unit somewhere else. It lasted through 6 uses, with a burning smell. The gears stripped, and I threw it away. I just purchased the Chefs Choice 610 from Amazon, and Im very pleased. It did a great job, didn't smell and it was easy to clean up. It's a very nice unit for the price."
1,Don't bother,"I have never reviewed a product before, but I feel so disappointed I felt I had to share. If Waring had any sense of honesty about this product they would drop the ""Pro"" and ""Professional Quality"" from its packaging. They shouldn't charge anymore than $50 and refer to it as ""light duty"". It is flimsy and does not cut evenly. The food guide ""bends"" too easily with the slightest amount of pressure resulting a thick to thin slice. The blade moves SLOW and it's not as sharp as they lead you to believe. Luckily, I purchased this locally and was able to return it. The saying ""they just don't make things the way they used to"" describes my experience perfectly. What a piece of junk."
3,Not Particularly Entertaining for Children,"Our family loves to listen to children's music and this one left us unimpressed--and we're not picky! I think if one is an Elvis lover and wants to introduce their children to his music, this is a good way to go. Otherwise, these just seemed like adult songs to me. My kids didn't like the CD at all. I cringed when I heard the Old MacDonald rendition because I wondered how many vegetarians would be very upset if they heard it. For non-vegetarians adults, it could be considered amusing though."
3,An ok collection,"This is an ok collection. Since most of these songs were recorded for some of Elvis' movies and not really intended for a kids' album, it is kind of a mixed bag. My son enjoyed some of the songs on this CD when he was younger, other songs he never cared for. Once he got into 2nd grade he stopped listening to it all together. He said it was ""boring"". The only song he really liked was ""Teddy Bear."""
4,Elvis sings for kids,"My children had this music when they were little, and I have purchased a cd of this for my grandson. He is only 15 months old, but he bops along to the music, especially Old Macdonald. The music brings back memories of my children's childhoods."
5,Circumstantial Evidence Only,"The book covers the life of Tom Horn during the cattlemen's war. He was found guilty and hung for the killing of a teenage boy. The evidence was circumstantial. Hopefully today, Tom Horn would be acquitted.The author does great research to reconstruct all the actions that lead to Tom Horn being put to death wrongly. The book is easy to read and understand. You feel as you know the man, the places and the time period."
4,just bought this product,i was watchig tv and i saw brazil but lift being advertised and it seemed interesting so i decided to check it oout on amazon. based on the great reviews that it got i decided to buy it and give it a try since i've been looking for a workout out programe that will be challenging but fun at the sametime. i've just ordered it and i can't wait to get it so that i can start working out so that i can have an amazing body for the summer especially when at the beach in my bikini. as soon as i get it and i've started using it i will give a review about my own experience with the workout programe. really looking forward to it and can't wait to start.
1,Terrible workout!,"I usually love the Beach Body Workouts. IMO, the best is Chalene Johnson's Turbo Fire and Chalean Extreme. Amazing!! I was hoping for the same quality with the Brazilian Butt Lift. Not so. The DVDs flash back and forth between beach workouts and studio workouts. The leader acts like he can't even keep up. He's a sweaty,Brazilian guy and the whole thing is just gross. Not motivating at all! Don't buy this program!"
1,Did not like the program,I bought the program and was very disappointed. The instructors voice got on my nerves. And I could barely understand what he was saying. The moves were hard to keep up with. Waste of money.
1,1/2 a product?,I order a DVD exercise program and it arrived without the DVD's. It then took the seller 5 days to respond to my requests. Needless to say I requested a refund. This could have been just a mishap but I suggest contacting seller before buying to ensure product is 100%.
5,Great workouts,"I have not exercised in almost a year because theres always something else going on, in a busy day. I try to do at least one of the cd's three times a week. (bum bum) I can start seeing some of the results, but I definately feel the muscles now. It is a great work out for anyone that has a problem getting the lower part of the body in shape. Do what you can, when you can. It is worth it."
5,Delivery and Package,"The items were in great condition,it was delivered quickly and as it was shown online. The cds do not skip the items were sealed and in the box."
3,"Burning bum, as well as wallet","I bought this product expecting it to be hard from reading the previous reviews. However, as a person trying to get into shape, this video is way hard! The first few times I did it I couldnt make it through all the way. Which made it discouraging and made me actually not want to continue. I feel like the price for this product is way more expensive then it is worth it. It fun, energetic, but (holy cow!) really not worth the dough it cost me to get the dough off of my butt. I recommend hitting the gym instead."
4,Time is an issue,"I have done this program for exactly a week and although I am seeing reults and the exercises are great, I predict that time commitment to the program will be an issue. The first week of the program is the easiest compared to maintanence or subsequent weeks. First week, exercises last an average of 35 mins with 2 days break. Subsequent weeks only has one day break and some days, involve approx 1 hour of exercise. I honestly don't know when I'll get my exercise in. I work full-time outside the home with three young kids under 9. Since the kids fall asleep by 10pm, I would go to bed no earlier than midnight if I get the exercises in each night (shower included). And if I do exercises each night, then spending time with hubby will just not be possible. I could wake up 5am but geez....I won't be awake the rest of the day to enjoy my ""boom boom"" :D Well, those who can committ to the program 6 days a week with an average of 40 mins a day, then you will definitely see results."
2,"DVD not working, but good workout","All of the DVDs in the set had problems playing and stop at different points, really annoying when you are trying to workout. I'm an advanced exercisers and like the Sculpt weight work for adding variety from my normal routine."
3,Just getting Started,I'm just getting started and I feel the burn. Today was my first day and the work out was pretty intense. I don't normally work out tho. I'm 5'3 and I weigh 168 pounds. I want to get down to 150. I really believe this DVD will be very helpful for me. I'm hoping as time goes on I will be able to do the moves better and that I will be able to keep my balance better to. I must admit I substitute half of the moves with other work out moves that required laying these moves were shown in the booty basics DVD. This help me catch my breath. Overall good work out. I was able to do 25 minutes of the 35 minute bum bum work out and its my first day and first time doing any type of workout DVD. I will update this review in a week.
3,okay,Great but I did not see too much improvement during the 4 months I did it every day. And all these tapes only have skinny nice looking models doing the exercises....so you know they were NOT like I am................
3,Its ok,You can find these type of work outs for free on you tube. Not really worth the $...It was alright I guess.
4,Review of Brazilian Butt Lift,The videos were brand new and came in perfect condition. The product works well but some moves can be tricky for beginnings. The yellow resistance band was the only disappointment with this purchase. The band broke after two weeks of use so I had to go out and spend 20 dollars on new ones.
3,It's ok,"I have gone through and done Brazil Butt Lift a few times now for the 4 weeks, it definitely will tighten up your heiny, however most of the workouts are so-so. The Bum Bum and High & Tight workouts are awesome, really work the ol glutes, and personally I'm pooped after Bum Bum. However, the Cardio Axe, Body Sculpt, and Abs workouts are lame, I usually end up using different videos in place or run instead. If you're just looking to tighten up your tush, go for it. If you're looking for the total package, maybe look elsewhere."
4,Good workout but questionable DVD quality,"I have been using this workout for over a month and it works great. I felt it work the first day.However, I have had to return the same DVD two times because it skipped around and froze up. Out of all the workouts included, the Tummy Tuck (abdominal) session was faulty each time. I am currently waiting for my third DVD.Although I am frustrated, Tony from Books-For-Everyone has provided excellent customer service in processing my requests. I would give the workout a 5/5 but because of all the problems with the DVD itself, I have to dock it 1 point.I would highly recommend this workout package. The DVDs are not that long and can be completed relatively quickly (20 minutes-1 hour depending on the DVD)."
4,finally results,"I really liked the program. It was difficult through. I have always had a big bum and cellulite since I was a teenager (totally unfair). However, this program has given me the lift, toning, cellulite is definitely reduced. I will tell you though, I went hardcore for one month solid (2 workouts a day and toning;strict diet)but I found myself bulky, like a body builder, so careful if you put on muscle fast, the shrinkage comes later. Dont get scared, eventhough it freaked me out! I modified it a bit with just cardio days in between one workout and toning. This is something that has worked for me when nothing else has, not the gym, very strict dieting, nor treadmill. I like that you can do different workout combinations for your schedule and energy level. Thanks! money well spent.!"
3,not what I had expected....,"I ordered the Brazil Butt Lift hoping to lose a few inches around my waist and 10lbs. After having a baby, I'm a little out of shape, but figured this wouldn't be too bad. I found many of the moves difficult and not easily explained- maybe this is because I've never done yoga or pilates, but I guess I just expected them to be explained much better. I think this workout system would be better for anyone more familiar with yoga or pilates. The transitions between moves were difficult and confusing, and I feel the majority of the moves would be hard for a beginner! I did 'feel the burn' though, after each workout I tried, even when I was just hopping around when I was too confused by the moves!"
4,Brazil Butt Lift,This is a great workout for any fitness level.I use body togs on my arms and legs.I also alternate with using my 12 lb.weighted vestFor maximum burn.The music gets annoying quickly but since I learned the choreograpy I turn down the music and listen to music on my ipod instead.
3,good butt workout,I like the butt workouts a lot. I was however very unimpressed with the cardio video. I feel like I get more cardio from the bum bum videos. Overall a good butt video but that is it.
4,Love it!,I bought this product to prepare for vacation and lost at least the 6 pounds expected to lose with the first 4 weeks and definitely lost inches and toned well. I dropped two sizes in pants after using this product as they inidcate.
5,Great product!,Knocked my butt back into shape!!! Excellent program!! Really does work if ur committed! Great diet plan... Only thing is the elastic band that comes w it is kinda cheap... I'd buy a good one cuz it ripped real easy.
5,Wow!,These workouts are amazing! You can definitely feel the burn with just the warm up. They are so much fun and super easy to follow.
2,Not what I thought,I didn't feel like this workout was for me. It was awkward even in the comfort of my own home so I returned it.
5,Wife LOVES it!,My wife says this workout has kicked her butt all over the place. Great workouts and a lot of soreness the first couple of weeks.
1,Annoying and Injury Inflicting Videos,"I have only been through the instructional Basics, and the Bum Bum videos so far. In my opinion, fully completing the Bum Bum work out would require the knees of a ten year old.No one with weak/problematic knees or backs should invest in this program.The exercises are well are targeted though, with the triangle scultping. The standing exercises just demand far too much from my knees.Classical pilates uses the same principles of working all the muscles (ncluding smaller supportive muscles), from different angles; and it is much safer as it promotes muscle, joint and bone stability versus fights it. For the amount of pilates BBL draws on, you'd be better off just doing pilates."
5,Wow!,I purchased the videos a few summers ago after having a child. At first the videos were really hard and I spent many weeks on the bum bum live video. Eventually I moved up and was able to complete the other videos in the set. I really believe this product works if you put in the work. If you are having trouble at first start slow like I did. I noticed a difference in my butt after a few weeks of just doing the live video.
4,Surprisingly Pleased,"I've held off on the purchase thinking that it would be too easy. I've done P90X and Insanity...along with Kelly Coffey-Meyer and P90 Boot Camp. Well I fell off the wagon of working out and needed something new to inspire my 4:30AM wake up work out. And this did the trick. I'm not a dancer by any sorts, and I found myself smiling during the Cardio Axe!! It's actually fun!The butt and ab work out are challenging. I gave 4 stars because I do think I'd need a few other DVDs for a fully round work out. Although the cardio is fun, it's not extreme.But I'm pleasantly surprised and so happy with my purchase!Also, I started my 4:30 work out mornings 2 months prior to Brazilian Butt Lift (I was doing Chalean Extreme, mixed with some Tony Horton and cardio)....oddly enough I've had more results with this work out. I noticed my thighs and butt start shaping immediately. I'm still not back in my ""normal"" clothes, but feel it's close, and look forward to it soon!Good luck!"
3,Too high impact for me,"However,...this is great for someone who is in good health and has healthy knees. There are a lot of lunges in the program, especially the Bum Bum dvd. If you are not used to doing excersises, this MAY be too hard for you and can leave you thinking ""what did I get myself into?"" On the very first day, I could only do 6 minutes. I had to skip 2 days because I was soo sore from the first day, I also did 20 minutes on the eliptical. Bad idea. The 4th day I was less sore and only able to do 9 minutes. It will get your heart pumping for sure even after 5 minutes. Don't give up. I have a lot to lose and I want to get in shape for summer. I recommend that if you are a beginner to cardio like me, don't incorporate any other exercise with this for it will frusterate you and possibly wear you out, making you give up completely. This is your cardio, strength training, and pilates in one. If you aren't used to or can't use your knees or have pain in them, I don't recommend this."
4,Brazil lift,"I started working out again last November to prevent the holiday weight gain. I work out 6 to 7 days a week and since I have kept it up now for 3 months, I decided to treat myself to a new workout video. I have completed 3 weeks following one of the scheduled plans, there are 4. I am not eating the included menu options, as I already have eliminated fast food, fried food, soft drinks, etc. I also substitute Zumba instead of the cardio axe, but otherwise I follow the plan. I did not take any before photos or do any measuring, but I can feel a difference in my bum bum and thighs. I am definitely more firm and lifted. I recommend these videos to anyone who is looking to firm up their lower trouble spots. He progresses from one move to another without breaks between and likes to up the tempo, but you can always go at your own pace and follow the beginner moves."
4,BBL is AMAZING,"Leandro is so awesome. The workout is really tough and delivers results! Before doing BBL I was in shape (would do cardio and toning classes at my local gym and ran a lot), even though I was thin, I had a droopy butt and a pear-shaped body. Within a month, not only do I have an amazing butt, but my legs and abs are in way better shape as well. Leandro makes the workout fun and walks through the exercises slowly before speeding it up. The only con is that after a while I got a little bored with the videos and purchased Turbo Jam, BBL Deluxe, and p90x to change it up."
4,Ouch! But in a good way!,"I have only done one of the workouts in this set, I just recieved it yesterday. Wow! It looks and feels like it really targets the butt. Can't wait to update this review after a week or two. The first workout was Bum Bum and it was fast paced, think it will take a couple of times to master the moves, but I already feel it. The instructor, Leandro? I think. He sounds a lot like Borat from those movies, it makes me laugh and smile when I hear him talk. But it isn't really annoying, just funny if you stop and listen. But he does talk alot and cues you to keep everything tight. Music was good and not at all cheesy, so that helps. The 30 minutes really flew by! Lots of lunges and leg work, I hate lunges with a passion and really dread them, but somehow he makes them bearable. Do this 5 times a week and watch what you put in your mouth and there is no way you won't see results. I look forward to updating this review to tell you if it's true or not!"
4,Wife loved this for a little while,Wife said the workouts are a Bit repetitive but they definitely do what they're supposed to. . . . .
2,Not Fabulous,Way over pricesd Only 2 of the works out were even woth doing. I will say that the 2 that were worth doing were really really good even though they were very short in length. One was 10 minutes the other was about 28 minutes. Overall very disappointing. The dance routine I thought was very lame and slow. Nothing challanging at all. I am not a hard core workout person but do like a good workout if I am going to find the time to do it. If you are a beginner you may find these videos to be for you but deffinitally not for anyone that works out regular.
1,The DVD DOES NOT WORK!!,"My dvd's does not work! it plays to the point where the line up is, but not the actual excercises! such a waste and I bought 2!!.Brazil Butt Lift"
1,Defective DVD - seller unwilling to cooperate!,"I ordered this series based upon reviews from friends, and while two of the discs and all the stuff that came with worked fine; one of the DVD's doesn't play properly (only in Spanish, skips to the middle every time). I have contacted the seller numerous times looking to have just the single disc replaced and never received any response. Now frustrated and seeking help at Amazon, they tell me I have no recourse as the seller's return date has passed.It would have been nice to have some sort of contact from the seller regarding this; and I certainly expect them to replace an item which never worked in the first place; irregardless of the time frame. I have been stuck in hospital and therapy visits with a disabled daughter, otherwise I may have been able to make the cut-off date, but with no answers to any of my emails, who knows!!???"
3,Good Workout but Make sure You get an English copy!!,My wife really loves the workout but unfortunately one of the videos only came in Spanish.Normally I would just exchange it but she got to that one after Amazon's return policy expired. Kinda leaves a bad taste about the product but the workout is good I hear
2,Difficult,I bought thinking I could ease into it. Having joint and muscular pain it was very difficult to do the exercises.
5,Brazilian Butt Lift,"Brazil Butt LiftLove this product! It's working wonders, only problem I have was in the shipping. When I received this, one of the disks were loose, and it skips when I play it in a couple of spots. I've tried cleaning it, but it's scratched. I need to exchange it!!"
2,regret this purchase,"I was really looking forward to writing a great review on this product, but after a week i am extremely bored with the workout selection. There is really only three workouts you get to do on any given day.. And the workouts are quite ""dancy"" I spend more time figuring out the next step than actually working out. i like the toning workout; its very structured and easy to focus on form. (Which is what is most important when exercising). I loved the wokouts the first week.. But am now regreting this 80 dollar mistake. . :( - Disappointed customer"
3,Won't play in English!,"Really frustrating.....I go to the set up menu, select English then Main Menu. I play a section of the video and it's in Spanish. It refuses to stay on the English setting. I can get English subtitles which helps a little but totally unacceptable that I can only hear it in Spanish."
4,Great for lower body!,"My first impression after watching the DVD set was not that positive: it seemed to be too fast-paced, and the switching back-and-forth between the studio and the beach was kind of annoying. I was all-set to return it (I had ordered it directly from Beach Body). But I decided to at least give it another shot, and WOW! I was so impressed! My lower body felt amazing just after the first workout. I was sore! I could feel it working my lower abs, hips, butt, thighs, and saddlebags. This is a VERY challenging workout system. I have to do a lot of the modifications and there are a few things that I won't even attempt to do for now, but that's okay-- there is a lot of room for improvement, and I can already tell that I'm going to be using these DVDs for a long time! They are well-worth the money. I use the DVDs along with my cardio workouts, but maybe in the future I will do one of the plans found in the booklet."
3,"DVDs are okay, lots of upfront reading.",The guy on the DVD doesn't really work out to the beat on the video. It's a little distracting. Not bad overall.
4,excited,"I am very excited since I received the package yesterday. Today I am starting the program. The only thing that I would like to have known first, before buying the product, is that you need to purchase ankle weights and light dumbbells in order to do the other workouts. It should have said somewhere. Nonetheless, delivery was good. I'll keep you posted on my results."
4,EFFECTIVE!,"I really enjoy most of the dvds in this set. The only problem I had was with the cardio disc, if you can't dance, like me, it's confusing and you look like you're spasing out. The other dvds are all very effective and I use them a lot, but for cardio I use a different workout program."
5,Great but not for me,"I still give Brazil Butt Lift 5 stars because it does work if you do it like they want you to do it. I tried the program for a few weeks and I saw results after two weeks.BUT I have to say that most of the moves are too ""dancy"" for me....I am not that coordinated and had very hard to follow the moves when doing cardio axe and even bum bum wasn't great for me. I did like sclupt, high and tight and tummy tuck. I just ordered P90X and I think this will be more something I am looking for!Brazil Butt Lift is great for people who like dancing or who are able to move their hips.....apparently this is not me! :)"
2,Not for me,"It does tone your buttock but left the other parts out of balance so I injured myself more than helped myself. I was out of shape but not overweight. I would not say I was a beginner/beginner in fitness. For the time I put into it, I saw far more better results from other fitness videos in a faster amount of time and for less money. I may go back to this video now that my core is toned but I would not recommend this one to start out your at home fitness program."
3,CD quality questionable,"The program is great. Lots of good enery, tough ab routine and the aerobic portion is somewhat easy. But the quality of the CDs were very questionable. One skips a lot even when I first recieved it - but no returns. That sucks"
2,not worth the price,"To start with, one of the DVD's wouldn't play, so that was annoying. I tried a couple of the others, and they were ok, but I expected more from this company. I have the Insanity work-out, and love it, but was disappointed with this one. In my opinion, the guy who narrates the work-out is also incredibly annoying. I'm sending it back."
5,NOT A FALSE REVIEW,Brazil Butt Lift really work! I wasn't overweight but I wanted some toning in those trouble areas so i decided to buy this workout. My trouble spots were this little bulge of fat above my butt and inner and outer thighs...I know workouts are supposed to be challenging but this one KICKED MY BUTT! omgosh! I mean I didn't expect such a hard workout from such a soft title but Jeezus! High and tight is still the most challenging for me but believe me....this workout works. A moderate healthy diet and this workout WILL get you results.....I've actually never written a review but for Brazil Butt Lift I HAD to
5,"Definitely works the leg, booty and abs!","This is a great cardio and lower body workout. The cardio keeps your heart-rate up and only takes a little over 30 minutes. Not much of a warm-up, so I would suggest doing a good warm-up before beginning the cardio axe portion. The toning and strengthening workouts for the booty also work the legs and the abs. I had been doing p90x and was using this for cardio and I had a difficult time completing the workouts for the legs/booty and the abs!! I was sore a couple of days later and anyone who has done the legs part of p90x knows that your legs get an excellent workout, but this routine really works different muscles (I don't know how Leandro found them, but he did). I like to mix and match my workouts weekly to keep me interested and this is a great addition to my routines."
5,jsjsj,wow! really intense workout surprisingly. i've only done one of the dvds so far but i got a lot out of it. am i the only one who noticed he sounds like borat?
3,"Masters of the English language, beware!","Did a bunch of 6th graders edit the booklets? Literally dozens and dozens of typos. Makes me not trust the product. I mean really, do you have so little pride in your product that you don't put forth the effort to even edit correctly? Or did you not think the customer was going to even read the booklets?"
4,Crazy freakn' excercise!,But I love it!It is very fast-paced and difficult to follow at first but you get used to it. I'm on my second day of the pear-shape program and I am sore like crazy! My legs tend to feel like collapsing at the 10 minute mark of Bum Bum but that's the thing with this program; you need to push yourself in order to get results. The instructor is very energetic and encourages you to push. I'm only 17 and I have thick thighs and a not-so-firm tush and ordered this when I saw this on an infomercial. It's fun and tiring. I can't help but take 2-3 one minute breaks to catch my breath but that's because I haven't worked out since November. Can't wait to finish the program and see results!!
1,NOT WHAT I HOPED FOR,"If you are looking for a video that will give you a Jlo or Kim K butt, this is not it. If anything I think my butt is actually smaller than when I started. I have been exercising for years, and I was able to pass the pencil test given by this video, but I wanted my butt to look bigger. My husband, son and my son's friends were unimpressed with butts of the girls on the video. So that is a range of 23 to 46 years old. Most of the videos seem to work more your thighs than you butt muscles, and I did not have any issues with my thighs. Anyway have given it more than a 120 days, and I am totally disappointed in my results. Waited too long so I can't return so I guess I will keep doing the High and Tight and Cardio Axe DVDs. Will look for a different DVD to actually work out my butt. What a waste of $70.00."
3,defective product,I received the videos and did the booty basics. It seems to be pretty good but as someone else said the moves change quickly and Leonardo doesnt give much warning. That is all I can review because this morning I tried to play them and they are in Spanish even though I have repeatedly set it to English. Also two of the workouts on different disks wont play at all. Im going to return the product and will really have to think about whether they are worth purchasing again.
2,Annoying,"I borrowed this workout from a friend to see if I should purchase the video and I am so glad that I didn't purchase this. I find the videos to be annoying and it has poor transitions. I can't get thru any the dvds before I want to chuck it out the window, so I basically do the moves on my own."
3,DAMAGED DISC??,"I purchased this from Betts VIA Amazon, for a family member overseas. After having shipped to them i received a call from them telling me one of the discs was damaged. The time it would have taken to ship it back to the US and return it would have passed the return period. I was very disappointed...Secondly... is it really necessary to ship a small disc package in box that could hold 3 pairs of sneakers?? It made no sense and the discs weren't even in the padding packs. It was on one side of the box and the discs packs were on the on the other...really?? Very disappointing....Two stars: poor packaging and damaged products!"
3,It's OK,"The guy Leandro, the trainer, is super obnoxious. I turn the volume down and turn on Pandora or my itunes usually. The exercises are pretty good- I feel the burn after each workout. I wish it would come with the bands though, since it's so expensive. The one leg band is pretty weak and feels like it's going to snap at any moment, but hasn't yet!"
4,"Works great, but a little too fast paced","I really enjoy this DVD. I have my fav workouts and my not so fav. I really like the floor exercises, you can tell they work you. The actuall butt lift work out is really fast paced with some difficult moves in a small space. So I will stick with the other DVDs!"
1,Manufacturer refuses to replace defective product,"Great DVDs, however after a few months we discovered that the third disc is defective - it skips and does not allow to watch the full program. The manufacturer refuses to replace the defective DVD because the DVDs were purchased through Amazon. Here is the email I received from them:""Thank you for contacting Beachbody..I am sorry to hear that your Brazil Butt Lift DVD doesn't work. I would like to help you but unfortunately, I am unable to locate your order. Please forward the following information used to place your order so that I can locate your account and assist you further:Date order was placed:Method order was placed (Web, Phone, or Mail):If by Web, please specify [...]Order # (if available):Please be advised that we do not sell/replace any individual Dvds for any customers who did not purchase the program directly from Beachbody.""Shame on BeachBody."
1,Disappointed,Disappointed; the Dvds kept skipping over damaged areas. Dvds came with visible scratches. Product shouldn't have been sold in these conditions.
3,Buttlift,"I have been doing it for two weeks now, and i have lost so much weight my butt hasn't exactly lifted just because don't have all the equipment but you can still see a difference in it."
5,Brazil Butt Lift,I think this product has produced results quickly and hit my problem areas. I am getting stronger each time I exercise and plan to continue doing it for maintance. It is really fun. The best part is you see the results fast.
5,Results!,"I bought this from the beach body website but I wanted to leave a review here because reading these reviews is really what encouraged me to purchase. I just completed the 6 Day Supermodel Slimdown and I am impressed. I am 5'3 and overweight. In 6 days I have lost 3 pounds and 4.5"" total. I've lost a inch of my waist, an inch off my hips! I cannot wait to see what thirty days on this has to offer me! You will not be disappointed!"
3,Is It Just Me???,"Let me first say that I think the program as a whole is great! I was definately sweating after the first day! However; Is it just me or is the dance/cardio routine a little complicated to learn?! My son and husband thought I was just being lazy until I popped it in and had them try! They couldn't do it, but my husband insisted that if I keep at it, I will learn. I wish I was a little more coordinated, because I believe in this program. I will continue to do what I can, and hope to see a difference in 30 days!"
2,Buyer beware - low quality merchandise,"Normally, this type of information doesn't go here, it goes in a message to the seller. But this time it does belong in the review because I think you will have the exact same problem as me, whoever you buy it through. One of the DVDs does not play in the DVD player. It will only play in my laptop. It does have a set up menu, but will only play in Spanish.As for the workout itself, it was disappointing. Definitely will make you sweat, so that's a plus, but there is a lot of twisting of the ankles and standing up on your toes, which sucks for anyone with a previous Achilles injury. I bought a DVD at Walmart for 3 dollars that I thought was a better workout."
2,"Great Workout, lousy product/customer service quality","First of all the workout is incredible. HIGHLY recommend the workout but unfortunately it is packaged very cheaply and customer service is non existent. The DVD's are snapped into a carrier which is typical but it is so cheap, you can't release the button. One of the DVD's cracked trying to remove it. Another DVD would only play the Spanish language track.I contacted customer service 9 times with everything from receiving an email saying it was resolved but they did nothing, an auto response stating I would hear from someone within 48 hours but they never contacted me, to zero response, to finally ""send order information"" which I provided back in May. Still no replacement DVD's and waiting!"
5,awesome!,great workout - I am sweating everytime and very sore - but thats good! I just need to be more consistant to see better results.
5,Great workout that is easy to learn!,"This is a really great workout that gets you sweating. I have a lot of workout dvd's. Some of my faves are, Turbo jam, Jari Love, Jillian Michaels and The Biggest Loser. All of these are not known for any type of dance. I really thought I would have trouble with The Brazil Butt lift series. (I like kick boxing or interval training myself) But Leonardo has made a fun workout that isn't too difficult and will get your heart rate up quickly. I love how you can customize the workouts to your body type too. This is a great investment and a lot of fun!"
2,Not the same as on TV!,"I ordered this because it was a better price than on the TV, but I had to return it because I didn't get all the extras that I was suppose to get with my order. I was able to send it back for a full refund without any problems."
2,Brazil butt lift CD's,One if the CD's will only view it in Spanish. Cannot reset it to English... Have tried multiple times. Very disappointed!
2,OKAY but not worth the price,"Jillian Michaels Killer Buns and Thighs is just as great if not better, for less than $10I guess the ""hype"" is what makes Brazil Butt Lift over $60"
4,Do it at your own pace,This workout program definitely works. The moves are somewhat complicated and they're done at a really fast pace. The first couple of weeks I did this workout I didn't even try to keep up with the girls. I just did the moves at my own pace. By the third week I was able to keep up with them. I noticed changes in my body at the end of the first week and I didn't even make any changes in my diet. I gave it a 4 because the instructor is annoying and he's not very good at giving instructions.
2,"GREAT workout, some questionable moves...","Don't get me wrong, this system is a great workout. I definitely felt the burn! However, some of the moves may be a little too advanced for some who are not familiar with yoga or pilates. Some of the moves are not eased into enough so that you don't throw your back out! For example, there is a backbend at the end of the Tummy Tuck DVD that could be dangerous for some who are not as limber. Overall, this is a high intensity workout (even the basics's DVD) that could potentially transform your rear end. Also, you must somewhat practice some of the workouts before you can jump into the whole routine. I say this because the workouts are pretty fast paced and you could be hastily doing some of the movements just to keep up...and this is how you get hurt."
3,IT DOES LIFT YOUR BUTT,"I can say that I've seen my butt lift and tight. I'm 42 and 108 lbs. I have done other WO(WORK OUT) without problems. In this one ""like some have said"" the CARDIO is not to my like since is about 3 COMBOS of DANCING MOVEMENTS that if you are not familiar with is hard to do b/c you dont have time to learn and you need balance. All the WO to me are too fast pace and I guess b/c of my age my knees hurt at some point. I love HIGH AND TIGHT, BUM BUM and TUMMY TUCK. the SCULPT is good but then again my shoulders start hurting at some point even if Im lifting small weights. Im on my 4th week and im feeling good but im going to find a different CARDIO WO and maybe a diff. SCULTP since is about 50min. and sometimes a dont have time. Maybe a younger person, a fit person or a dancer will be able to keep up with the whole system. BUT YES IT HELPS TO LIFT YOUR BUTT."
4,not for beginners,"i recieved the workout program and began working on my Brazil body the next day. i was plesantly suprised to learn that it is not easy, but a little discouraged because i am in not in the best shape and the constant, fast pace videos kicked my butt with in the first few minutes (five minutes in i had to sit down and watch the rest of the video). the program teaches you the basic steps ( i was tired just after doing them) and the trainer is entergetic and motivational. im happy with this purchase and hope that by the end i will be able to do the 20 minute exercises all the way through. i ordered the set and it gives you everything you need."
1,"NOT FOR BEGGINERS, UNREALISTIC","I started out by practicing the moves for a few days and watched the intro twice. I though I was ready to do the bum bum video. No way this is way out of my league. They are doing all kinds of sexy dance moves, jumping backwards onto the floor and then back up, changing moves really fast, there is NO level 1 to start with. You start at full speed...... advanced level. I can't understand the brazzillian that well either and he's annoying to watch. The girls are all so fit and tall I can' keep up with it. Going to mail it back and find someting more my speed where it's more for people that need help not people that are already advanced in they type of movement."
2,Brazil Butt Lift,"I bought this product because I've tried P90X and liked the workouts. However, both Beach Body products came to me somewhat broken! I'm not sure if it's coincidence or just my luck. This product doesn't work on any of the TVs in my house or my computer. However, it will occasionally play the first part of the disc. I have just had a major problem with Beach Body products. Love the workouts, but they just never seem to work."
1,Pretty difficult if you have not danced before,"I really like some of the workouts and I can tell they work. However, I am not a dancer and don't really know how to dance at all. A lot of the moves are pretty difficult...it is just kind of a lot at once for me, and they move really fast. I don't feel like I learn how to do the moves well enough."
5,Love this program!,"At 57 years old I was looking for something that would actually make a difference in the areas of my body that were not as attractive as they once were! Plus, it had to be on my schedule, effective and fun! This program meets all of my requirements and then some, I am having a great time, a great workout, and starting to see results after one month...I am thrilled with my decision to purchase this program!"
3,Igloo Magazine's REVIEW,"Review by: Luca Maini, Igloo Magazine ([...])(09.22.05) Despite appreciating the previous Sublight output, I really can't get into this Doormouse album even after several deep listenings. Furthermore, I can't get the late change in sound Doormouse had since Xylophone Jism. In the past he made classic breakcore tunes and messy mashups, with a great sense of humor, --but since his major changes towards instrumental and calm music, his production is less entertaining. It's not simply the delusion of a breakcore fan suddenly betrayed, it's that this record lacks complexity and catchy melodies, and it fails when transmitting emotions to the listeners. It's supposed to be a very intimate album, but maybe it's even too intimate; it gets introvert and cryptic and will make Doormouse' parents and close friends happy. The rest of the world runs the risk of being excluded."
5,Underrated,"This is one hell of cd....overlooked by many maybe because it was one of JBs earlier work....from the romantic ""lovesongs, candlelight and you"";and the ever popular ""Iam holding on"" to the laid back ""Going Home""; ""Baronese""; and ""Reunion""....I marvel at the genius of JB....I could get it over the counter because it was not in stock anymore....another masterpiece for my colection"
5,My Calgon Song,"I purchased this CD just for track #16, High Tide. It is a beautiful song. I imagine that I am on an island away from all the cares in the world. It is worth purchasing just for this track alone. The other songs are added bonuses. Enjoy!"
4,Jonathan Butler,"Although it took longer than expected to arrive, I enjoy this CD. However, the CD does not contain all the songs which were on the album."
4,Love It! Love it! Loveit!,"I really enjoy this album... It's great.. Lies, Holding on.. However I can't hold out on his instrustmentals... I Have enjoyed this since it first came out back in the 80's If you don't have it run out and get it. A must have for any Jazz lover....."
4,MUST HAVE!,"I'm currently breastfeeding and I use bottles whenever I need to leave.This organizer was the best out there.I love the fact that the two baskets could be used for the dishwasher since there is a lid stored underneath.The down side is that you could only fit a total of 7 bottles.Avent 9 ounce bottles are not one of them(don't know about the small Avent),but I still put my Avent bottles in it,just won't fit on the bottle holders.Like most parents,I have more than 7 bottles,I store the rest of my bottles somewhere else."
4,A Must Have!,I received this as a shower gift and absolutely love it! I wish I discovered it with my first child. It holds 7 bottles ( I use Johnson & JOhnson healthflow) and they fit very well. I like that there are two draws; one for nipples and one for collars and caps. It makes life easier knowing that everything is in its place when needed.
3,One place to store bottles,"I received one of these as a baby shower gift. The only part I really use the the handles at the side to air dry bottles. I do not find much use of the disc with bottle slots because everytime I wash the bottles, I need to wash the disc too."
2,OK for other bottles...,I liked the 3-n-1 organizer however I am a strictly Avent mom and the bottles don't stay on or in.... I am taking mine back... they need to make the holder rings alittle different...
1,Worthless If You Use Dr. Brown or Wide Bottles,"I bought this thinking I would save a lot of room on my counter. Unfortunately, I use the wide Dr. Brown bottles and they don't fit at all! Even the normal width bottles can get stuck when you try to turn it. Also keep in mind if you use the curved bottles that this product won't hold those either. I returned this the next day, thank goodness! My best advice: get used to bottles on your counters! They're only little for so long!"
2,not for big bottles,"This item is well designed and is easy to use, if you have small bottles. I used the Avent bottles and could not get them into the bottle slots. I also had a few playtex nursers that wouldn't fit. I ended up just using the drawers for washing the bottle nipples and rings in the dishwasher and giving it away as soon as my son was done with his bottles. If you plan to use the bottles witht he smaller/skinnier openings this product could be great, otherwise I wouldn't recommend it."
5,David Knopfler's Best Album to date,"This album is an excellent example of David Knopflers work. David actually has seven albums out of which this is the only one available in stores. There are 14 tracks on this album and if you get to the last one and have any children you are in for a gut check. What an excellent writer! I dont quite understand the music biz yet so I don't understand why David is not played on radio stations, I sure hope this changes in the future."
5,"Great vitamins, kids love them....buy from Amazon for good packaging","I chose these vitamins because they are made from food products, not chemicals....I like the idea that they have concentrated vegetables in them, no added sugar and no artificial colors. My kids really enjoy eating them, and I think they do well with these vitamins. I've tried them myself and I personally think that they are better tasting than your average grocery store vitamin. The only flaw I have found is that they break easily so if the shipper doesn't ship them in decent packaging you get a lot of broken vitamins. But I bought my last bottle from Amazon directly and they did a great job with packaging and very few vitamins were broken. I know this is supposed to be a product review not a packaging review but I wanted to touch on that subject because the product IS easily breakable, so you want to pick a decent shipper.I used the Subscribe and Save option to save even more money on these."
3,not for a gummy texture lover,"My son prefers gummy vitamins & this is proving to be difficult for him to ""swallow"". I read the reviews & researched vitamin ingredients, etc. & hoped this one could be the one, but it's only been a few weeks.... HIS initial comment after tasting it was ""This is yucky, I don't like it."""
2,You expect a child to eat these?,I have a son who has never fussed taking his vitamins. I love the rainbow light brand for myself so when I saw these I thought great. Wrong! These taste horrible. At first I thought my son was fussing because they weren't the cool dinosaurs so I decided to give them a try. Yuck. This is not a kid friendly taste at all. Food based or not these are not worth the price because the will not be consumed in my house.
4,Family movie with children 12+,"A young teen girl living in a small town in Norway, receives mystical messages in her mailbox. She finds out that the deliverer is a street dog, which she follows. The dog leads her to a mystical man, who takes her through a journey of Europe's big 'thinkers' from Socrates up today and artist eg Sheakespere. Full of good special effects, and very well played by Silje Storstein and Thomas von Broemsom (who by the way played the uncle in Hallstroem's 'My Life as a Dog'). When i recommend it as family movie, is because a lot of good discussions could come out of it.Languages in the movie is Norwegian and Swedish, so be prepared to read subtitles."
1,Recycled Cliffhanging,"When viewing the 13 lame chapters of ""The Black Widow"" (1947), it is apparent that the Golden Age of Movie Serials has ended. How could the reliable professionalism of Republic Pictures take such a nosedive? Except for the villainy of Carol Forman in the title role, ""The Black Widow"" offers few thrills or surprises. Instead, the producers rely on its catalogue of Republic stock footage to create a ""new"" chapterplay. The cost-cutting is painfully obvious throughout - made worse by a largely unappealing cast. Do not judge the art of movie serials by this fiasco."
5,Lost classic.,"It's hard to add much to what other reviewers here have already said.You know when you buy an album and you can tell after the first couple of plays which are the three or four 'good' songs (sometimes less !!) that are bound to be the singles? Not on 'Already', almost every single song is good enough to be a single, it's hard not to think that if this record had come out five or six years earlier it would have been massive ( it's better than JJ '91 album 'Doubt' ) but musical fashions change fast and the band were not considered 'hip' anymore by the time 'Already' was released.Thats a real shame, if you ever remotely liked JJ, take a chance on this record and I bet you'll think it's one of the best you've ever bought."
5,Get the damn album ALREADY!!!,"Jesus Jones deliver some of their best work yet on this album. If you thought 1991's 'Doubt' was good (and I know you did), then you must pick up 'Already.' Some of my favorite tracks have come from the new album (i.e., 'Top of the World,' 'Wishing it Away,' 'Look Out Tomorrow,' 'For a Moment.') and you know I can't be wrong 'cos I'm always right! Get the album; you'll be singing the tunes for days, weeks, months, or years."
5,Fantastic! A++++++++++,This is the third time I ordered this book. We love the large print and the abundance of prayers.Fantastic!
5,A Worthwhile Purchase,"I definitely recommend this book to anyone needing great reference on the subject. The illustrations are superb, clean and serve their purpose well. The descriptions and text are well written- all around worthwhile!!!"
3,read Dagyab Rinpoche's Buddhist Symbols in Tibetan Culture,It's a more interesting and authoritative reference for this subject matter. This is due to Rinpoche being a qualified (I emphasise the word 'qualified') Lama and Tibetan scholar. Also at no point does Rinpoche compromise Tibetan Buddhism by giving away restricted information.
2,cool graphics crummy game,this game has really cool graphics but it always freezes at a certain point and you have to start over unless you saved it. i really wish i had read the reviews before i bought it.
1,Don't bother,"I'll keep it short--Don't bother. Compared to other recent games like Jedi Knight 2, etc, this game is 5 years behind the times. The game engine is a clunker and the controls do not allow you to respond at the same rate as your adversaries. The Tolkien Estate should be ashamed..."
3,Who knows?,"Unless you are a beta tester for this game, you should be careful in your review of it. While I agree that the Lord of the Rings is a fantastic movie, don't let your gaming judgement be clouded. Look to Computer Gaming World or PC Gamer for honest, up-front, and biased reviews. These people are professional gamers who test games like this all the time. Having said all this, I have no doubt that this will be a great game, but be careful and look to others who have actually played this game."
1,One game the suckest of them all.,"I am a realy big fan of the lord of the rings, but I found the game to be borring and hard to controle. I did not like ANYTHING about this Game."
1,what a surprise.,"Well, i was going to point out all of the flaws of the game, but it appears to have already been done multiple times. Also, it's only the first book of the game...which i guess i dont actually remember the names of the books now (read them 3 or 4 years ago) but i was expecting the whole story...so just a warning if you are too lazy to look up which book is which like me. and as near as i can remember..theres a lot of inconsistancies with the book...it doesnt seem to really follow the story like ver well at all. and skips through big portions of the book. basically..it appears to be totaly worthless. i guess the movies came out and they just threw together a game real fast without bothering to worry about gameplay issues."
1,Bastardization of a great book,"Who cares whether it follows the plot of the movie or the book? It's got terrible controls, very few options, stupid, repetitive tasks, a linear, shallow plot, and it's ridiculously easy. This game totally blows."
2,Lord of the Rings Review,"I have played the game before and it is a lot of fun, however, the game has refused to run on my current system(sli configuration) and this could be my computer's fault as well as running Vista operating system."
2,not worth the effort,"Easy to install, and easy to play, and plays well, but just not interesting. I gave up after about half an hour. Well perhaps it is just me so I gave it to my 10 year old and he also gave up on it. So it went to the donation pile."
2,The Fellowship of the Ring Game isn't clear,"I found that this game isn't very easily understood. You have to search and scrabble for any answers that you may need. This game needs to have a page for others to view eachother's findings. That would be a help. I enjoyed the books and movies, but the game is very frustrating to understand."
3,Decent game,"I suppose its decent enough in itself. It follows the storyline of the books and doesn't have irritating cut-scenes from the films. But too many glitches and when i played it crashed my computer thousands of times.Overall, it's worth a play but beware it may well disappoint!"
2,a 14 yr old,"i figured hey, its lord of the rings it cant be that bad. i was almost right. bad things are it takes a video card (which isnt all that cutting edge anymore) but still cost about $100. and with that video card the graphs. are still very choppy and not that good. also, although im not a very good gamer i think they should make it easy enough to get past the ringwraiths in hobbiton. but from what i did play it was ok."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"Look, I bought this game because I love The Lord of the Rings, John Ronald Ruel Tolkien was a great guy. But this game sucks! I'll give it one for good graphics and environments, but it was just too easy! You could flip through the levels in at the maximum in three days. What the hell is that? It's not at all challenging, and you can only play as Frodo, Mithrandir, and Elessar. If you want a good Lord of the Rings game, then buy the ones made by EA games. They are more challenging and cooler. This game is best for a seven-year-old. In conclusion, do not buy this game, but buy EA's version."
1,Can't seem to start it,"This was a gift and I finally got around to installing it. Or I should say tried. I tried to run it on a laptop and 3 computers but the game will not start. Just a black screen.The one thing to be aware of is the fact that your monitor card has to be texture and lighting compliant. My nvidia quardo fx 1400 from some reason will not work.Also, note that Black Isle is dead and Vivendi has a not that they will no longer support this game.Do not buy it.If I ever get it running I will come back and change this review."
1,It made me mad.,"Thank goodness I didn't pay for this game; I bought it with a rebate offer. I couldn't get the game to launch at all. My computer is adequate to run other games comparable to this game, but this game doesn't seem to work with my computer. I have been able to run lots of other games until I tried to install this one. Poorly written game. I tried to install the patch and that didn't work, either. I put in so much effort to make this game run and it just wouldn't. DON'T BUY THIS GAME unless your computer meets the specified requirement on the dot."
5,This Game Is A Classic!,"Oh, alright! So maybe this game is not a great game to most people which means that it is not a classic. But it is, and always will be, a classic in my own opinion. 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' PC game is fun to play! The action is intense, the adventure is wonderful, and the excitement this game has to offer is brilliant! This will always be one of my favorite PC games."
2,decent graphics but clumsy game,"This game has decent graphics but as someone else said before, The movements of the mouse are just clumsy and slow.It takes forever for Frodo to react when you try to make him move with the mouse.It seems as if he was running in slow motion.This is a great inconvenient when you are trying to fight and jump since he is much slower than the enemies.Also even though the game resembles the book more than the movie it gets actually boring at some points.Its so hard to make the characters move and run smoothely that it turns frustrating.Comparing to Alice, Undying or even Harry Potter this game is a major disapointment, I can't believe I paid 50 bucks for it!"
1,Very Disapointing,This is the worst game i have ever played. It has major probloms installing on XP. It took me an hour before i could even play. The controls are insane. You will often get stuck in the corner of a room. In the begining you must complete pointless quests to get useless items. I looked for a lost kid for half and hour and what is my reward. A mushroom!! I tried to explore the shire but whenever you take a few steps off the path there is an invisible wall. fighting is cheasy. you go through confusing mazes and hit spiders with sticks. no mater what haptens to your allies the will never die. All they seem to do is get lost. while in moria you can barely even see what your fighting. The voices are cheesy. The balrog is barely taller than gandalf and is easy to kill. The boss of the game is a ringwrath on a bird. While on the ground it does not even try to huryt you when it is in the air shoot it three times and the game is over. anyone who bought this game should return it like me.
2,Only runs with newest video cards.,"Do not buy this game if you have an older PC. I have 2 PCs and I couldn't get it to run correctly on either. One of the PCs is less than a year old. When I wrote to the support people, they told me that the game does require a video card with at least 32MB of video memory (and other requirements). Mine only has 16MB. To be fair, it does say that on the box (in the small print). They should be required to put that in big letters on the front of the box. Especially since you can't return it once you've opened it. I did go out and buy a new video card (PNY Verto with nVidia GeForce4 MX 420 w/ 64MB of video memory ). Now the game seems to be running OK, but I haven't done much yet. It does look good once you get it running. I don't think it's for the hard-core gamer though."
1,How Sad,This is the worst game i have ever played. I would rather play pong or space invaders on atari. Even after downloading the patch the sound still dosen't work right and it still freezes on the mines of moria. I think the challenge is not playing the game but figureing out how to make it work. I am an experianced gamer so i have a very good comp and have never had problems with any other game.
1,Utter garbage,"Reviewed on a 1GHz, PIII with ATI Rage Pro 128, 256M RAM.This is a joke, right? We're not seriously expected to pay for this program which would have been considered unimpressive five years ago. The graphics are mundane, the character movement is crude and awkward, it doesn't play full-screen (it's always in a window). The cut scenes are played by 3rd rate amateur hacks with video/audio synchronization like a dubbed martial-arts movie. The third person view constantly blocks the objects your looking for and you can't change the view to be more overhead.The graphics are so crude the program should run smoothly on a 333MHz box but its really sluggish on my 1GHz. What's it doing with all the cpu time? Looking for extraterrestrial intelligence? If Tolkein were alive this dross wouldn't bear the name of the Lord of the Rings!I expect more from Vivendi - much more!"
2,Waste of a good title,"I've played many different Lord of the Rings based computer games over the years and this one is really disappointing. The graphics of the game are quite good, the story isn't bad, but there is something lacking. If I had to say where the game went wrong I'd have to say that it was to fast. Also, the AI is very poor, you can sit and shoot monsters with your rocks (Frodo), arrows(Aragorn), or spells (Gandalf) from a distance and they will stand there without moving until they die. If you want a real LOTR game go and find a copy of Interplay's LOTR and the Two Towers (see if you are strong enough to defeat the Balrog without losing Gandalf), ebay may have them (make sure they have the manual w/ them). The one plus about this game was I picked it up for 25, @ gogamer.com which wasn't that much of a waste of money as it would have been elsewhere."
1,It Sucks,"I have tried to load this game for months and I finally gave up!It made me so upset I had a nervous breakdown and was admitted to a mental ward, Where they put me in a padded room wearing a straight jacket, I'm O.K. now, as long as I take my medication"
2,not good,"i don't know if had a slwo system or the maneuraabilityh was hard to figure out.for a die hard LOTR fans, you'd think they would have tried to make the characters look like the ones in the movie.movement was VERY limited. only two way. would have rather had the roundabout way. where you can see everything....slowness is no good."
2,Way too easy!,"This game was way too easy. It took only a few hours to complete. Not much of a challenge for experienced gamers. Graphics are good, as are sound effects and music."
1,Dont waste your time,"Vivendi Universal should hang it up with making PC games, ever since they took over Sierra they have been turning out bad games, this one is one of them. the graphics are medicore, the sound is awful, and game play is boring, I would rather watch TV or surf the web than to play this."
3,"Game Enjoyed, but, problems exist","The game play is quite nice and the story is fun, but problems persist.While inside a building, control is fine, graphics are nice and commands are met. But outside in the land, contol is slow, commands are slow, graphics on the ground are bad. I have windows XP, so be careful."
2,...Not worthy of being associated Tolkein,.... The graphics are decent but the gameplay was terrible. First they send you around the shire doing dumb little jobs. Not a very exciting way to start a video game. Then you have to escape from a black rider. This is really stupid because you have to stay like 25 feet away from him but the game places you about 5 feet away from him. Then you run around fighting enemies that are just too easy. Most of the levels are extremely pointless. In one level they actually have you finding lillies.(I'm serious) All in all a very forgettable game....
1,Lord of the Rings:The fellowship of the rings,"Hated this game. Even after you download the Patch there are a lot of bugs in this game. There is no plot to this game, just a lot of shooting. I was stuck in one part of the game (the willow tree) for over two hours because when you use a mouse the movements are too jerky to shoot your target. The game is just running and shooting. What happened to good adventure games?"
1,Do not buy this game!!!,"Ok, firstly, i would like to comment on the good parts of this game. 1. The front of the box is well designed and would look good on my wall.Now that I've got that covered, lets go on to the bad things:1. The game will not install. Now, I DO have the system requirements. My Computer: 1Ghz pIII, 256Mb memory, GeForce2 Ultra (64Mb), 52x CD drive, DirectX 9.0b, windows update service pack 4, Windows 2000.I spent several hours on the phone with tech support, and they led me into more problems, then led me right back to where I started. Do not waste your money on this game. Play PacMan or something that won't waste 4 hours of your time trying to install."
2,Weak Game Play.. Buy the DVD instead of watching video clips,"Weak game. They are simply making money off of the name. If you are looking for a good RPG game, this isn't it. I am also getting the blue screen of death while playing this game. Buy something else like Dungeon Siege which was GREAT!!!"
1,I hate this game,"The movie was bad but the game is much much worse!! I can't believe this is even going to be released, what an embarassment to the company! Oh my word, I've never played such a awful game in my meaningless existence."
4,fun ok way to short,this game was ok but it freaken short. I would suggest not buying it if you dont like short games
2,Big Blow,"I've had LOR:The Fellowship of the Ring for PC since last Christmas and it blows.I was really disapointed. The gameplay was weak and there was little action till you got to Moria and even then it was weak. If you like fist pumping action I do not recommend this. The Two Towers is way better. I also forgot to mention it is based on the book, not movie."
2,what the....,This game was not what i suspected and that was a bad thing. Game is like nothing of the book and or movie. this game almost put me a sleep. Only good thing mentioning is the graphics there good but everything els could and should be remade or fixed. For god shakes put legolas in!
1,Terrible,"Absolutely disappointing. Terrible graphics, slow, controls are weird...it just goes on and on. For good LOTR games, check out the Battle for Middle Earth and The Hobbit."
1,Complete and utter crap,"I had high hopes for the whole LOTR Enterprise. Being a fan of the books for many years, I have high expectations for the films. I was hoping the the games would be a bit more than a hack & slash action game, there is no element of adventure in this game at all. Lord of the Rings game should always be a bit more involving than this load of total waste of hard drive space. This game is an complete insult to the whole Tolkien Enterprise. If you've bought this, wrap it up, send it to Vivendi expressing how crap you think it is. The control system is a joke, the gfx are ok, the gameplay element is non-existent, some of the bosses are easy, some of them are impossible. I've not bought the other games yet, but they had better be an improvement on this or I'll be sending a strongly worded letter to the game creators..."
2,Too Easy,"This game is too easy, you can beat in in less than 2 hours. Hint: All you do is just run by all your enemies and get to the last part of the level. NO NEED TO FIGHT THEM! This makes the game way to easier than it already is ridiculously easy. Not a good game to buy. Luckily, i got it for free after the rebate. :-)"
1,It is Boring,"I really gave it a try. I spent a long time just trying to get out of the Hobbit Hole in the beginning, then I had to get to The Green Dragon but couldn't find it. I love The Lord of the Rings and this game was a disapointment. Now don't think I didn't have the system requirements, because nothing was wrong in that area. The game was just designed weird. For instance,you had to watch the little introduction every time you started a game. I definitely do not reccomend this game. It's boring."
2,Buy the Two Towers by EA games.,This game is good if you like to sleep or if you played TwoTowers 1 billion times already and want different missions.Never even passed the first level.
3,Master Frodo hit me with a stick and it hurt. A lot.,"This game is great as far as dialogue and story is concerned(J. R. R. Tolkien wrote the story) and the acting isn't that bad. I have noticed serveral VO's from cartoons I watched as a kid, the cute lady hobbit(with the cutezy voice) in the Shire for one. Gandalf for another. I think most of these people were in The Gary Colman show and the smurfs or some such. Gandalf was the Snow guy from the Thundercats I think. The thing that annoys me is that even with the patch, EAX is horrid and non functional. If you are going to play a graphic adventure at least include decent EAX. Even an Audigy 2 doesn't work. That and the popping even when EAX is disabled is the sole reason I am cutting 2 stars off this bugged travesty of an otherwise good game.I like hitting my witless side-kicks with a stick and stone.:)=)"
2,instructions not clear,"I found that the instructions are not as clear as could be... It took me a while to find the true navagation and I do not really have it now.I found that the ""rebate offer"" was a bit deceiving also, I bought thinking that it would be free after rebate, I did not see or realize that I had to buy a ""Turbo Tax"" product to get the rebate. I have the Turbo Tax already, so I am inelegible for the rebate."
2,Don't Get this!! Get the BOOKS!!,I haven't really played that much of the game but the graphics are Terrible! For a game made from the books it's pretty acuret as far as the story-line but it could be MUCH better.If all you want is a computer game look at the books it doesn't seem that bad but your missing tons of cool stuff that's in the books.
1,Skip this turkey,"This game isn't worth reviewing, but when I saw it had cumulative rating or 2.5 stars I had to chime in. THIS IS A ZERO STAR GAME. It belongs in the five dollar bin next to ""Babbar and the Math Monkey"". I have no idea what the people giving it high star ratings are comparing it to, but it's not the top sellers most gamers play. The developers are banking on the popularity of the movie to sell this joke of a game which, by the way, doesn't take much longer to finish than watching the movie.Vote with your wallet and get a ""Fellowship of the Ring"" DVD instead--or any other Peter Jackson-based product. Then maybe we'll have more great movies and fewer [bad] games."
5,Stupid people,"This game is great. You people who dont like it cuz it doesent follow the movie are STUPID. It CANT follow the movie cuz they DONT have the movie licence. EA got that licence and THEY make the movie game. Vivendi got the licence for the BOOKS, so THEY make the BOOKS game. That is the reason for the characters not to look like those in the movies. And those of you who says it's bad can TRY to get a bit further before you open your mouth. THIS GAME IS GREAT IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH BRAINS TO PLAY IT"
3,"Not great, not terrible.","this game isn't terrible like people say it is. It has good voice acting (too much, though), mediocre graphics, and ok gameplay with [bad] weapons. The main problem is that once you beat it (which is very easy, theres nothing to the puzzles - and it's short) is that it has NO replayability. Single-Player only, and there is no way to vary the game if played over again. Also they messed up many things in the story - such as the ending. I don;t see how they'll be able to go on to ""the Two Towers"" (the game of which will be entitled ""the Treason of Isengard"" to avoid confusion with the movie's fighting game). ... Its worth checking out, though."
1,Dont Waste your time,"This game is a mockery of the LOTR image that we have all come to love. By exagerating miniscule details to try and tell a story, you are lost in a lump of hard to see and just plain stupid puzzles and games. You would be better off watching paint dry then playing this game. Do yourself a favor, get Two towers or return of the king, you will not be unhappy with those purchases. This game is seriously making Tolkien roll over in his grave."
3,"Easy, too easy","I bought this game with high expectations, for a game that claims to be the ""official"" game based on J. R. R. Tolkein's The Fellowship of the Ring. To start with, this game is relatively short compared to the GBA version;however,this game can be beaten in one day, without cheat codes!(it doesn't have them)With a annoying plot twist at towards the end, this game ceases to appeal to non-movie tolkein fans. The gameplay is pretty simple, providing you can take the annoying archers and Frodo's lack of fighting advantage. Only buy this game if your willing to take anything related to Tolkein or want to see a original design other than Peter Jackson's vision of Middle-Earth."
3,Good Game but Not worth the Price.,This Game is pretty fun very cool graphics - BUT SUPER SHORT - you could beat this game in a night with no problem. And for 50.00 bucks there should be multiplayer - but there is not. The Functionallity of the character is weak too IE; Some can't jump - some can't kick - there are only a few moves. - this could have been A lot better - BOTTOM LINE - Wait till the price drops to 20.00 - it is worth about that.
1,It really is that bad,"Please save your money and do not buy this game. If you want a good LOTR game buy the two towers for any platform. First off I had problems with sound (I have sb live plat 5.1) so if it doesn't work well for sound blaster what does it work well for. The graphics are okay, but being as how the gameplay is LAME and the quests you get are lame.. do not buy this. They took a good story and went off in the wrong direction. I ended up returning this after giving it a decent chance (even with the sound problems)"
1,One more thing...,"To those who say it follows the story, when the Hell did Sam get captured by a flying Nazgul?What a joke. They butchered the story as well."
1,"this is not a review, more of a question","Can you play LOTR: TFOTR the whole way as Aragorn or, ""Strider""?"
3,Ths Game is pretty average,Ya sure this games grphics are crap and it sometimes makes you go slow mo but it gets better towards the end When you face the Balrog and the Nazgul. Howeve3r just get the return of the king.
5,"Good Game, that fellowship of the ring!","I must say thatI really enjoyed this game! This has a story that sticks to the original plot very well, and, at times, even better than the movies! I am quite glad for the inclusion of Tom Bombadil, and Old Man Willow. This is a good game to get, and, if you're into The Lord of the Rings, I highly recommend it!"
3,"Color is Perfect, Quality is Just Okay","These are very basic. They're terry cloth but they really don't look as nice as I had hoped. I don't see this lasting a long time. For the money, I'd reccommend the Wendy Bellisomo brand of cover - they're a better material than these are."
2,not really impressed to be honest,I am not really impressed with the fabric. It's not soft terry cloth it's cheap terry cloth but for $12.99 I guess I hoped for more. It'll get the job done but I love the chenille fabric better it's soft on my baby's little butt and I'd rather lay her on it than the terry cloth. I do like the variety of colors that the terry cover has to offer.
2,Comes in just the right hue - just wish it lasted!,"I love how soft and cuddly this changing pad cover is. I also appreciate how many colors it comes in.What I am disappointed with is the durability. I have 3 of these and have used them for just over a year. They are totally falling apart at the elastic. Now, keep in mind that we use disposable ""chucks"" (those blue hospital disposable under pads) on top of this terry cloth changing pad. It makes it less messy (especially early on) and doesn't require washing as much. I also washed them in cold water with Baby Dreft detergent, hung them to dry and rotated the 3 covers that we have.While it is a nice product while it lasts, I just expected them to be more durable."
4,Bought the second time around,"With our first baby, we didn't get the countoured pad and covers. We thought it was frivolous and unnecessary. For our second baby, we received a generous Babies R Us gift card and went to buy all the things we always felt would have been nice the first time. The countoured pad and covers was really nice to have. It makes the whole experience feel a little cozier. You definitely need to get a couple covers, though so you can have one in the wash and one on the pad."
2,Didn't hold up well for us.,"After only a few uses and washes, this pad cover started to tear. It was ripping in the corners, and no matter how gentle I was, the hole got bigger.The color choice is out standing. . .however I just wish that it had held up a bit better for us."
1,Forget it!!!,Washed it once according to directions & it shrunk beyond belief! Didn't even use it once! Don't bother!!!
2,Not needed but cute,"We bought one cover when we purchased the contour changing pad but we never put it on our chainging pad. We prefered wiping down/ cleaning the contour changing pad on a regular basis. It just seemed more sanitary to us. Since we already purchased one and washed it, we ended up using it on our co-sleeper (the one that hooks to the side of your bed) as a fitted sheet."
2,Doesn't hold up well,"Great colors, and I like Simmons' contoured changing pad, which this is supposed to fit, but keep in mind that washing will significantly shrink the covers & the terry fabric doesn't hold up well. After just a couple of months, ours are already coming apart."
3,"Love the color, hate the material","I chose this pad cover because of the color. I also bought one in lime green--same brand, same problems. Although I like the color selection, I am not very happy with the quality of the material. It's a very scratchy terry cloth....my mom bought something similar, but a different brand and it's MUCH softer, just not as great a selection when it comes to colors. It also picks very easily. My cat has walked across the pad several times and snagged the cover pretty badly in the brief amount of time she's been on it. It's also gotten snagged every time I've washed it. I think if the looping was tighter as in higher quality terry this wouldn't be a problem. I haven't experienced a problem with it shrinking, but since I'm only 4 months in and it already looks pretty worn, I don't know how much longer it'll last."
2,Manufacturer Defect,"I have to say that I just 20 min ago recieved this cover in the mail, (I ordered online because I'm so far from a Babies R Us location) and I was excited at first. The color is great, and the cover fit perfectly, but I haven't washed it yet. Actually I have to return mine already because a manufacturer defect in the fabric. The fabric immediately shred along the elastic in one area(middle of long side). I plan to exchange this cover for another of the same, I hope for better luck with the next one, but man, the hassle of having to mail this back and sit and wait is just frustrating."
2,looks cute but shrinks and cant use,"I had a few of these covers in lilac and sage and i cant use any of them anymore, they all shrank so much when washed that they wont even stay on the contoured pad. i am now using a white cover from especially for baby which fits and washes great, unfortunately dirt shows and it stains easily. and they only have white blue and yellow and my daughters room is purple pink green and white."
3,It's ok,"I thought this cd was just ok. I like tracks 3,5,9. And the remix to Brotha Lynch's dead man walkin is sicc. But all in all he just doesn't really come with a tight flow like he did on Soutbound. He needs to get back to that type of style. So if you like the De, SOUTHBOUND is the disc to buy."
1,Definitely not up to snuff,"I'm a huge fan of mysteries set in Rome - but this series falls short of the rest. I liked the first couple I read, but was stunned at how the quality fell off as each book arrived. David Wishart can write, but for some reason he rambles endlessly, puts in unnecessary characters - and this from someone who loves lots of eccentric charactes in her mysteries - and generally over does the slangy casualness. I do get what the writer is after, but I don't think he achieves if except fleetingly. I have found the books frustrating, as they are almost good. Which is worse than just plain bad. Well, with the exception of the last book in the series - which was just plain bad. Anyway, check one or two out of the library first - perhaps you have a different viewpoint than I do.For reference - I like John Maddox Roberts, Lindsey Davis, Steven Saylor mysteries of ancient Rome."
3,European Perspective on Cyberwar,"Jean, a nationally-respected journalist in France who has covered espionage matters for decades, is the author of one of those rare French books that make it into the U.S. marketplace. Translated into English after great reviews in Europe, it charts the migration of European and Anglo-Saxon intelligence professionals into cyber-space."
4,Great for the little John Deere nut!,"My son has been haying with his grandpa since he was six months old and riding with our farmer neighbor for a couple of years doing grass seed and wheat, including riding in the IH Combine. He loves this game especially buying new equipment. A true farmer at heart, our six year old gives this a two thumbs up. After all he knows the difference between real and make believe and it is a way to pass time between harvests thats all, who cares about deatail as long as its fun?"
1,Not satisfied!,I ordered this for our seven year old grandson but he has not been able to use it yet. There should be a hard copy of the instructions included. I am not real computer savey so it would make it a lot easier for us novices! Amazon continues to be the BEST place to order just about anything. Always great service at great prices!!
1,this piece of garbage should get no stars,"I have never in my life owned a more useless, annoying piece of software. I downloaded the patch and it made things even worse. No matter what scenario I tried to play, I got crashes and freezes or distortions to the visual effects. If you want something that's going to make you grit your teeth and want to punch the walls, just visit your inlaws - at least when they tick you off it doesn't cost you anything."
2,Boring,"It's interesting to a certain point, but there are several bugs within the game and the overall game play is very boring. You do the same thing over and over. I got this as a gift, otherwise I would have never bought it."
2,"Pretty disappointing, compared to the Nighthawk Sport bulbs.","I bought these as high beams to go with theGE Nighthawk Sport 9006bulbs in my low beams. Unfortunately, Amazon didn't have the 9005 Sport bulbs in stock, but their two-for-one deal was too good to pass up.Overall, I didn't see a huge difference between these and the stock Sylvania bulbs that came with my car. I was expecting the light to be whiter than the Nighthawk Sport bulbs, but they're a bit yellow. They cover noticeably more distance, though.If you're just looking for decent quality replacement bulbs, and Amazon still has a good sale going, I'd recommend these. But if you're going for a specific ""look"", you're going to be better off with the Nighthawk Sport bulbs."
3,it's ok,"NEXT TIME , MAYBE I BUY DIFFERENT BRAND, THIS LIGHT IS YELLOW AND POOR.SYLVANIA SILVERSTAR IS HIGH PRICE, BETTER QUALITY"
4,Excellent replacement bulb - MUCH Brighter than stock,"I have a 2000 F150 with the factory fog lights which are virtually USELESS with the stock bulbs in. On the FORD Truck forum, people mentioned the NIGHTHAWK 9005 as a replacement for my F150 and I figured I'd give them a try. What a difference! I've been using these for about 7 or 8 years now. I would give them 5 Stars, except for the following: bulbs could last longer and I wish they were still available locally in stores like they were 7 years ago. One thing worth mentioning, is that the bulb won't fit the lamp housing out of the package. You need to trim one of the three tabs a speck to make it fit. Takes 20 seconds using a sharp pair of side-cutters using the original bulb as a template.For the life of me, I can't believe people would say these don't make much of a difference, unless they already have decent stock lighting or HID already. These bulbe compared to my regular low (and high) beams are much, much brighter."
3,ok but not dramatic,if you need new bulbs then these are a good choice....but not better than stock really...so only if you need em...
2,Nothing special,"I expect more light from this product than the original bulbs.Nothing special.If you really need more light, you should buy another product.I was very dissapointed."
1,GE Nighthawk bulbs,The Nighthawk halogen bulbs are no better than standard halogen bulbs.I have used Sylvania Silverstreak in the past which actually are an improvement over standard halogens.
4,Hidden Treasure,"I picked up the Jack Rubies years ago on a hunch and the thought that I had heard good things. I was really pleasantly surprised and this album is solid with some excellent songs. Great songs: Baby Fire, Good Morning Heartache, Walk Down Any Street, Book of Love, Western Sky, I Saw the Glory and Tijuana Bible. Good Songs: Lost in the Crowd, Beautiful Joe, Crazy Letter, Beautiful Joe's Bad Dream and Bullfighter's Disco. The others are ok. So you get a high quality album with some kick-a songs (especially the combination of Baby Fire and Good Morning Heartache. The music ranges from edgy pop to simply pop. If you dare, you will be rewarded."
3,Is it worth it?,"I don't know if it's really worth the price. I don't have a tablet (no inkwell for me) and I don't have a machine that will benefit from Quartz Extreme. I can get QT6 without Jaguar, and iTunes3 works without Jaguar. I'm happy with the address book as is, and while iChat could be cool, it's not alone worth [the price]."
2,wait until the rest of the world catches up,"UMAX scanners don't work in 10.2, Veuscan doesn't work, some Epson printers don't work well (1270), Quark is still behind the times in 9.?, importing mail addresses is impossible unless you like to write code, HELP index is gone - in ten days I average 1-2 restarts per day and have had to do one clean install. The interface is cute but I haven't been interested in cute since I was 18. FileMaker 6.0 out of the box changes data so do the upgrade before you start to work. I've used Macs for 12 years - threw out PCs where I worked but this release needs work along with the community.."
1,OS X is why I'm switching,"I'll be switching to a Wintell machine running ME.OS 10 changed just about every proven aspect of the Macintosh user interface. I can't stand the confusion of missing features and hidden access.Tens of thousands of system files reside buried deep in numerous directories. If something goes wrong, clean install is your only option.You'll need permission from God to do the simplest of maintenance.The OS is incapable of backing itself up. Something goes wrong and you'll be doing a clean install.Your old applications are worthless. Send another thousand dollar check to Adobe to replace those critical applications. Too bad you were just starting to forget forking over the check last time Apple made you replace all your applications. See a pattern yet?"
2,two things I hate about OS X,"1. The difference between OS X and OS 9 is greater than anticipated. I've been using Macs since 1987 and was a bit flummoxed at first. There's some non user friendly stuff you have to deal with. It's not like going from OS 7 to OS 8 or OS 8 to OS 9, where anyone reasonably Mac savvy can get acclimated quickly. OS X is way different, too different, and different in annoying nonMac ways. Yeah, think different, thank you Steve Jobs.2. Font rendering. Jaguar has smoothed fonts THAT YOU CANNOT TURN OFF ABOVE 12 PT TYPE. It is absurd that the Mac, supposedly the computer for creative media artists yada yada does not give you the option to turn off font smoothing altogether. Anyone who loves to read clear sharp text will not like this."
1,MIDI users BEWARE!!!,"I have a Mac G3 which currently runs in OS 8.6. When I bought my copy of Jaguar at Fry's I was told by the salesman that OS 9 was included. What a pack of lies! OS 9 is NOT included in Jaguar!Now I have to buy OS 9 to run in the ""Classic"" environment because my notation program (Finale) still hasn't come out in a native OS X version! The only hope I have been offered is to spend another $120 to get Panther so I can order a 9.2 cd ($19.95) from Apple under their Fufillment program.I know a number of Midi sequencers have updated to OS X, but anyone who runs legacy apps or equipment on their Mac will be bitterly disappointed..."
3,VERY ANNOYING,"Jaguar MAY be a sleek new OS that never crashes. It may make programs run faster. BUT I CAN'T FIND MY FILES ANY MORE! I hate trying to use Windoze computers because you have to hunt around a bizarre file structure to find your files. Jaguar gives you multiple desktops and stashes things in arcane places so that you have to use Sherlock to find them. IF I WANTED A SYSTEM I'D NEED A BOOK TO FIGURE OUT, I COULD HAVE BOUGHT A WINDOWS BOX! The whole point of Macs is they're intuitive and easy to use. If you're accustomed to Mac OS 8.x-9.x, then set aside a few days to figure this one out. It's not like upgrading from 7 to 8 to 9. It's a strange new world."
5,the best os ever,"my mac used to crash 5 times every day when i was running mac os 9 and below. i had to restart the computer each time. when mac os x came out, i didn't restart my computer for 8 months. 10.2 promises to be the best, most powerful and most innovative version of Mac OS X ever. i played with it at an apple store and it was absolutely amazing. it was faster, more responsive, it had many, many more features, and it was prettier also. i would recommend 10.2 to anyone at all. i don't care about the 129 price tag because it is just too amazing to pass up."
4,Well Worth It,"Though I experianced serious problems during the install that forced me to reinstall twice I believe this was because my current version of 10.1.5 was in bad shape. However, since the install I have experianced few problems, though it took me several days to download all the software updates. Virtually all problems I experianced in 10.1.5 have vanished, my isub no longer causes a kernal panic, and Internet Explorer no longer crashes after being launched. I have also found the Safari, Apple's new internet brower is far more stable and faster than Internet Explorer ever was. One of the main reasons I upgraded however was because so many programs required a minimal of 10.2, since then a wealth of new programs have been made availible to me. Jaguar was definitly worth the upgrade, anybody running an older version of Mac OS X should upgrade."
4,One of the good ones.,"Mac OS X.2 (10.2 or Jaguar) is one of the sturdiest operating systems i've used. I know most pc users out-right hate Macs... I don't OSX including OSX.2 has UNIX built in. This allows great things to be done. And supports older Mac software. I can't wait for OSX.3 (Panther)... This will add more great features such as Expose, a new version of Mail, a new finder (they allow labels to be used like in MacOS/System 7 & 8), and even fast user switching. iChatAV will remake the face of instant messaging. Panther is the only way you could make Jaguar better... Panther will even come with X11 (Xfree) to allow Linux programs that use XWindows to run."
5,Just plain stunning,"Installing Jaguar on my G4 Cube was a great, easy, quick and stunning... BR>But seriously MAC has always been better / easier than Windows (even though i think Microsoft is a great company giving good support for MAC users) with Jaguar, Apple just makes life TOO easy. OSX has grown into a powerhouse system.Ignore gripes about printers and whatever, just enjoy the easy interface, improved software and amazing networking opportunities.IF YOU ARE HESITATING? DON""T!!!Just buy it and see the future of OS.We all love our macs, we all love the stability of classic OS..."
4,"Best Consumer OS, no question","i work with windows at work, and play with mac at home. jaguar is by far the superior in so far as stability, elegance and speed. again, as with most pc vs. mac debates, aside from gamers, most end users should be fine on either platform... the difference being whether one wants to enjoy their time on their computer or struggle with the usual windows snafu's. the look and feel of jaguar is elegant and responsive. i had os x 10.1 when i first got my ibook, and i immediately noticed a snappier response when opening apps and files when i upgraded to jaguar( even though my graph card can't fully take advantage of quartz technology).the only gripes i have with jaguar and os x is the difficulty in personalizing the desktop and general look of the os (although like i said, the default look is excellent). there are ways around this, although the hacks and apps are endorsed by apple, so do so with caution."
1,Significant Disappointment,"I can't begin to express my disappointment with Mac OS X. I recently upgraded my beige tower to OS X and now need to downgrade to 9.0 to make it work. There are three main problems. First, OS X disables the printer port so you have to buy a new printer in order to print. Second, it disables the floppy drive; it only allows for CD drives or zip drives. Finally, although my system exceeded the minimum requirements, it is very s-l-o-w. For instance, Netscape takes 30 seconds to open a new message window. I strongly recommend against upgrading to OS X. If you have a new computer, it might work, but for an old one stay with the tried and true. My next computer will use Windows; I am disgusted with the Mac."
1,"Joke! $129 for bugfixes, and should've been done alreadies.","$$$$ for a bunch of bug fixes, and things that should have been already done, e.g. multithreaded Finder, system optimizations, gcc 3.1, etc.The rest of the ""features"": not to me they aren't, e.g. ooo iCalendar, ooo iChat, Quartz Extreme(no hw), ftp in finder -- why?, inkwell -- not a tablet/PDA -- useless, etc. all useless.For a $$$$, I'd expect a new filesystem supporting either soft updates or journalling, and honoring case. I also hope that they fixed their little SMB file/volume share problems, e.g. accepting a perfectly valid [] in file names(a *NIX side filtering error, easily correctable), etc.Bottom line, lets get our Ts crossed and our Is dotted before we run off willynilly with featuritis. After all this is why KDE/GNOME are still junk. Does no one bother with getting the nuts and bolts right before cramming in more useless ...?"
1,still not a full functioning os,"i've been a loyal mac user for almost 17 years. this one is a major disapointment. there's almost no control over this os. you just can't customize it. it's slow, a lot of my peripherals still won't talk to it. there's still tons of missing software that make it just plain impractical. it costs a lot to update all the old software, yet there's no added functionalitiy. as far as i can tell, it does nothing that os 9.2 can't do (and do better). it claims to be bullet proof but this not the case it's allready crashed. this was a waste of money and i highly recomend that those of you who have os 9.x stick with it. maybe i'll try again with os XII or XIII, if apple is still there. uncle steve made a giant mistake here."
3,Not for old machines,I installed mac os 10.2 and it booted with no brightness. I'am using a apple wallstreet 250 MHZ. Every time I startup the screen is dim and I have to turn up the contrast. If I wake it up from sleep mode it won't let me adjust the brightness unless I reboot. A real big pain in the neck. I have been using OS 9 for 3 years now. I was planning on upgrading my memory and my hard drive. Then go to 10.2. I'am glad I tested it first before upgrading. That would be a waste of time and money. So it was a good lesson. Do not run Mac OS X on a old machine. Back to 9 I go.
1,A B-movie? No! An H Movie!!!!,"This is the kind of filler that cable movie channels show when they aren't showing the good stuff. There's action, blood, explosions, and stuff: the things guys love. Still, this is nothing new and very low-quality. Cash kills a bartender in front of a room full of people, doesn't wipe his fingerprints off the rifle and throws the rifle in the street where any cop could pick it up. Still, he's never punished for murdering someone in broad daylight. The movie is filled with poorly thought-out stuff like that. Yes, the cash character has a delicious body. However, he only shows it shirtless once and doesn't show more of the goods. If you want to see lower-than-third-rate ""guy flick,"" then this is for you. Otherwise, please look elsewhere for quality movies in this world, of which there are many."
4,good stuff,"if you like Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, you will like this. This is a film that had to be made, and a film I wish I had made. Rich with parody, many references to the crime and gangster genre. It is way, way over the top. I am writing this as I am watching on cable. I have been waiting for a movie like this for a long time. It is violent and funny, entertaining as hell. A movie that will appeal to the lowest common denominator among all of the guys out there (no offense to the ladies intended...) and also worthy of scholarly review by the ivory tower. Jow Bob sez check it out (no boobs, however)."
5,I wonder where his name came from...,"This movie is low budget mess, but it is a perfect mess! So bad that it is an instant classic! I got it from RedBox expecting the usual straight to dvd crap they fill up their free slots with but this movie was something else. From the first minute to the last! I watched it two times in a row. The first time I died at the comedy, the second time I actually got the story. Madd voilent and ridiculous! One scene he gets a knife thrown at his rear shoulder, turns around, kills the guy that thrown the knife but is too lazy to remove the knife from his back so he just goes on with his revenge journey with a knife in his back. I highly recommend!"
3,ok for the money,"they're ok. easily adjustable, but the wrist straps are pretty flimsy and unreliable. compass and thermometer may as well not even come with it, because they suck too. But actual pole is pretty durable. I use these for skiing, and the packable poles are great for transportation. just make sure you tighten them pretty well!"
4,"Fast shipper, as described","Fast shipper, as described Fast shipper, as described Fast shipper, as described Fast shipper, as described Fast shipper, as described t V.t.. .g."
5,Trekking pole,"The trekking pole was exactly what I had ordered. It came in 3 pieces that fit together and tighten to make a walking pole of desired length. Although there were no specific instructions as to how to assemble the pole, it was obvious from the diameter of the sections as to how they fit together. A quick twist and the sections were fixed in place. Although I have not taken it on a walk as yet, I have used similar ones in the past and am sure it will work fine."
3,OK for the price,"Does not absorb shock very well. It is difficult to lengthen/shorten the pole. However, it is good for the price."
1,Do not buy from this vendor,"While I would like to offer a useful review, I cannot due to the vendor's inability to satisfy the order.A friend purchased this hiking pole from our wedding registry. Two months later I received a call from Lee, who worked for the vendor, demanding additional money to have the item shipped. Shipping was paid in full during the initial transaction so I refused additional payment. Lee then informed me that the order would be canceled, but the seven dollars in shipping would not be returned to our friend that purchased the item for us.Amazon fixed the problem, but I would steer clear from buying anything from this vendor."
4,Pros : A restored classic Cons: If only it was longer,"Great mazes and gameplay, but the screen size gets to be a big pain. It took a few month to beat, but the animation at the end was worth the wait.I can hardly wait for the sequel on N64. If you have a SNES buy it NOW!!! If not, wait till December when the sequel comes on the shelves. If anyone in my family is reading this, I WANT THE NEW ONE FOR CHRISTMAS.In short:Pros: Great mazes, funny animation, great replay value, and hours of play.Cons: To short, not to many original mazes, and 2D."
4,Pac-Woman goes 16-Bit,"If only they kept this form when they had Ms. Pac Man as part of other games for the next-gen systems. This is great! I guess some people are nostalgic for the shadless old-school arcade style of gameplay, but I think this is perfect. I mean, the graphics have more depth, meaning the colors are more attractive and..., you know?"
5,great game,Great simple game for all the classic arcade nuts out there. I found that it plays best with the Super Advantage joystick controller.
5,Ms. Pac-Man,Love this game so happy with it thank you so much. I have fun playing this with my boyfriend.It was received in great condition.
4,Shattered,"Shattered is available on DVD March 2! This is a great indie film and I highly suggest you give it a shot. It is full of nonstop action and the supense is nail bitting, literally. Check out the synopsis:When four lifelong friends decided to open the hottest new bar in town, they never thought the night of their lives would turn into their worst nightmare. But when one of their own is brutally attacked and manages to trap her assailant inside the bar, their friendship is tested like never before. Lives will be torn apart and bonds will be broken as they decide whether to trust justice to take its course...or take justice into their own hands.*Sponsored Post"
2,'Thelma and Louise' It Ain't,"Whoever greenlighted this movie must have been on crack! Taking four ambitious, independent babes and have them buying a bar in this day and age is so 80s. Then taking the premise of 'revenge for rape' from ""Thelma and Louise,"" which did it smartly, and turning it into this drivel is a joke.Don't waste your time! The only awards I see in the future for these four actresses is a mantle of Razzies."
4,Great for swaddling,"These blankets are great for swaddling your newborn, however, now that my baby is two months old his feet hang out the end. Althought it is cute to see his two little feet peeking out the end, it would be nicer if the blankets were longer to cover up his entire body for a little longer than just 2 months. I still use the blankets every night as they serve their purpose. Since it is warm in the house and it is getting warmenr outside, the feet hanging out the bottom is not that big of a deal, but for those of you that need to cover up your baby during the colder months, you definately want something longer than these blankets. The worked perfectly for my baby. They are soft, durable, cute patterns and not bulky at all, so they fit in the diaper bag nicely."
1,Compatabilty Problems,"I bought this card and after installing the drivers, Windows XP could not recognize the card. When I talked to Netgear customer support they told me the card was defective and I should return it. I sent the card back to Amazon and Amazon quickly sent a new card to me (Amazon was great about the whole thing.) After going through the whole process with the second Netgear card, that card didn't work either. I ended up installing a Linksys card and it works great."
1,Same card as the Linksys WPC11 v.4,"They changed the chipsets in these cards to Taiwanese Realtek chips. Where the Linksys WPC11 pre-v.4 was easy to install and was supported by AbsoluteValue systems' linux-wlan project, (http://www.linux-wlan.org/docs/wlan_adapters.html) the realtek chipsets are not. They are a real pain to configure now. If you want to run this card / chipset under Linux, look elsewhere ... like at the Netgear MA 401 which is supported by AVS."
2,Very poor signal quality,Do not buy this item if your signal is not all ways excelent.I have prevously owned the two older versions of the netgear 802.11b pci cards and both were much better than this one.Only buy this item if you want a small compact card and you have an excelent signal quality.
5,Easy setup and strong signal,This card was extremely easy to setup and linked up quickly. The signal is strong even across the house. Only while running the microwave do I ever lose the signal.
1,Do NOT use this card with Win98!,"This card is incompatible with Win98 SE, regardless of what the product listing says. I spent the past 55 minutes with Netgear tech support, with no resolution to the problem other than ""contact Microsoft because their operating system isn't installing these drivers correctly."" Pshaw! My prior Netgear card (MA401) worked fine on the same machine. This new model simply won't work with Win98 SE."
1,Poor Technical Support,My Netwiking Card all of sudden stopped functioning afer 4 months in use. Reading the literature on web I was able to do basic debugging and found that Networking card is not able to pickup the signal and when could not resolve the issue I called there Tech Support who were not willing to help at all unless I agree to pay them 28$ service fee or agree 2$/minute charge of the call. Guys have you heard of this. My experience with Netgear is not good and would suggest you not waste your quality time and money on poor quality products from NetGear!!! And be carfull of their disgusting technical support
4,the bonus tracks make it a fourstar.,"On it's own this was one of the troggs most poppy efforts ,even with the monster classic hit 'love is all around' it still was far less rockin than the protopunk rockin' 'from nowhere' was by far. I like the songs here but it's just not as powerful. The bonus tracks have some great songs on here though and that brings this one up from a 3 star all the way."
2,and Lam-o was his Nam-o,"""Troggs Roar Through a Dozen Rocking Numbers"" says the review...uh, where exactly is the `roaring'...?Don't get me wrong-I love the Troggs. Wild Thing is a classic moment in pop history.Their garage R-n-R still holds up to this day, even with the limitations of their top 40 pop image.But there's a good reason this album was never released in the US - and that's because it's full of limp, orchestrated pop songs sung in a wimpy Prozac style.Come on guys, you don't even mean it. And it shows.`Love is All Around' is the exception but that's available on many re-releases.The only thing that saves this sad effort is the many bonus tracks.For fans and completists only."
5,Another enjoyable read from Cecelia Ahern,"I've really enjoyed several of Ahern's other books so when I found this title at my local paper store, I snapped it up. Even though the book I picked up had been mis-binded (actually read backwards page wise... a bit tricky really) I was so absorbed in this tale that I didn't mind struggling a bit to get through (in whatever direction) for the story. Her writing is quirky, beautiful and lyrical. The story focuses on a character undergoing a transformation. Unlike many romantic stories I've read lately, Ahern's thoughts on love may be whimsical but always reality based so that you never have to feel the novel is ridiculous. Yet, she still brings a lovely romanticism to the tales. Also, there is a little plot-twist that I didn't see coming. All-in-all, for this avid reader- a great find!"
5,If You Could See Me Now,This was an excellent read. Really hard to put this book down. A great escape from reality.
2,Somewhat dissappointed,"""You've Got to See Me Now"" was dramatically different from Cecelia Ahern's first two novels. I loved ""P. S. I Love You"" and ""Rosie Dunne"" and pre-ordered this latest novel before it was officially released. Unfortunately, her departure from reality to fantasy left me cold. Also, I found Elizabeth was far too astute, too detailed, not to have picked up earlier in the story that Ivan was invisible to everyone else but her.However, I'm still Cecelia's greatest fan"
2,Not what I expected - seemed like a book for teenagers,I read and really liked PS I Love You so I thought I'd give this one a try. I'm really glad I got it from the library rather than buying it. I felt like it might be fun for a 15 year old but was silly and hard for me to get through and I only did so because I have a hard time not finishing a book. I was not surprised to read on the back that the rights to the film version had been bought by Disney. I have no prolem with imagination and books of fantasy but this was plaing juvenile and the heroin a bit neurotic and mean for my taste. Maybe I'll try Rosie Dunn or Rainbow's end or whatever it's called but I think I'll try the library again. I would have given it one star but I didn't have the heart since some people seemed to like it.
2,Buy it only if it's half price...,"Although I believe/dream of fairy tales, this book was more geared towards a children's section. It was more comparable to a teenage crush than a romance. I didn't like Elizabeth, a highly intelligent woman, couldn't understand the world of make believe. She was totally oblivious to the fact that no one saw her friend and kept calling her crazy. I also think Ivan's explanation of himself and why he had to go could have been more powerful. I did like that it showed how strong a connection two minds can make and commend Cecelia Ahern on approaching a romance in the non-conventional way. I give it a 2 because the first 100 pages were slow but it does get better further in."
5,Wonderful!,"This third novel of Cecelia Ahern did not leave me disappointed in the least. It was romantic, whimsical, and refreshingly different. I highly recommend it and can't imagine anyone being disappointed by the end of the book, (except that it is the end). I'm happy to add it to my personal library along w/ her other books. It truly was an endearing story. I look forward to another book by this wonderful, inspiring, talented young author."
3,i recieved this book as a gift!,"I recieved this book as a birthday gift from my best friend. It is not the type of book I would necessarily pick up and buy. The idea for the storyline is original and the characters are easily brought to life. Ivan inparticular lived on with me. As an imaginary friend, he definately brings life to the book, although his fate left me feeling cheated. Elizabeth could be slightly annoying at times, letting her family rule her life and basically closing herself off from everyone. I felt sorry for her nephew, Luke, who at 6 years of age has a mother who's an alcoholic with a peter pan syndrome and an aunty who shows him no love or affection. The book definately has it good moments and I enjoyed it enough to seek out Cecelia Ahern's previous 2 books. Overall, the story has good intentions, but you may find yourself rushing to get through it at times."
4,I won't give up,"I love Cecilia's writing. She's a very good writer, and storyteller. With P.S. I love you, I cried and laughed the entire time, it was great. Same with Rosie Dunn, very good books. This book was good, but not great. I suppose because of the unexpected fantasy thing that happens, also it didn't end the way I wanted it to. This does not deter me from looking forward to her next book."
4,Fairytale for adults,"This was really good, I liked it because it was an unusual story.This is a story about two sisters. Elizabeth and Saoirse. Elizabeth try's to make a perfect life for herself... perfect house, perfect job! Saoirse is the opposite. Saoirse's life a mess. Saoirse drinks too much, doesnt work, and constantly steels her sisters car. Saoirse also has a son. Luke, who is taken in by Elizabeth as Saoire is unable and unwilling to take care of him.Both Elizabeth and Lukes lives change on the arrival of Ivan who teaches Elizabeth that live doesnt have to be as difficult and serious as she makes it and he also becomes a close friend Luke."
1,County Kerry Corn,"A child's imaginary playmate gets the ""hots"" for the lad's aunt/guardian and decides to loosen her up a bit. This kind of blarney is not my Irish cup of tea and I threw in the towel halfway through. Read anything by Maeve Binchey instead."
2,Bad - Good - Bad,"That is how i felt about the book. the beginning was slow and not interesting. the middle of the book was great! and then the ending sucked. i might have not been in the mood to read a whimsical book such as this but i just did not like the way it ended. Currently reading Love, Rosie which is MUCH BETTER."
4,good book,okay it wasnt that much good T&#304;LL the end in the end i really weeped it was unexpected ..but cecelia ahern's books are easy reading and while i'm reading i feel relaxed dont know why it's a book u don't HAVE TO read but you can read easly good book i enjoyed
1,Disappointment,"Practically an impossible tale about an imaginary friend. Cecelia, you are a much better writer than this 3rd grade style of writing."
1,absolutely unreadable,I just ordered the book because it had a 4star rating at amazon but I couldn't believe how bad this book was. It's absolutely overrated. I think I didn't even read the first 50 pages.
4,Heart Warming,"This book might just be a piece of fiction, or you could chose to believe that there is more to life than meets the eye. This book brings joy and hope, I loved it and instantly recommended it to a friend of mine whose three year old daughter has an invisible friend called Eva."
3,Unusual,"I asked my cousin if she recommended any books, she rated this as her all time fav. I read this book in a few days and found it a heart warming story and very unusual. The story is captivating and I couldn't put the book down, however it is not something I regularly read. I rated this book 3 stars as it is out of my comfort zone, and not a very meaty novel. All up I found this a light hearted, entertaining read with an interesting twist... well worth reading to the end for!"
2,Not my type of story,"First of all if you do not like fairy tale type stories, you will really not like this one. I think this is my main problem with the story being not that keen on fantasy stories. It definitely would appeal to those who have a child like imagination which I am afraid to say I dont.Having said this though, the Cecelia Ahern is a good writer, and her style kept me reading this book.I have read Rosie Dunne which is a really good book, and I was looking foward to this story. Just a little disappointed by the plot because from reading the back on the book you would never know that it has a fairy tale element.I will not give up on Cecelia Ahern because like I said her writing style is fabulous, but I cannot recommend this to anyone that thinks only in reality."
5,Great,"I originally picked up this book because I was out of ideas to read and so I started in the library at the letter A. What a great book! Kind of different with the whole imaginary friends thing, but a great story. Very well written."
4,Happy Little Story,"Firstoff, it is important to say that I am strictly a non-fiction reader usually. But my friend loaned me this book that her mother had loaned her. She insisted strongly that I read it and even did a small sales pitch that I would like it because there is a hospice reference in the book. So now that you know that I do not normally read fiction, I can tell you that I was entertained. I read the whole book in two days. I had my doubts in the first 20 pages or so because it was slow to start and catch up on all the characters, but once the story got started, it was engaging. I did not feel it was predictable and I liked the conundrum the characters faced. I never felt that I knew how the story was going to end and I liked the mystery of discovering along with the characters how their lives would end up."
2,Disappointing - not my type of book,"I recently finished PS I Love You by the same author and absolutely loved it. I could not wait to read this book, but once I started reading and learned more about Ivan, I was so disappointed. I did not realize the story was a fantasy when I bought the book and thought it would be comparable to PS I Love You or to a Maeve Binchy novel.I couldn't get over the whole premise of the novel and therefore I couldn't enjoy the relationship between Elizabeth and Ivan. Like others said, I really felt sorry for Elizabeth's nephew but couldn't get into the book enough to care about the other characters.I have not given up on this author, but will be more careful the next time before purchasing!"
3,"Loved the idea, not the book","I loved the idea behind this story (adults need to hold onto their imagination), but the book was missing something. I became a huge Cecelia Ahern after PS, I love you and Rosie Dunne. I could not put those books down. I've been reading this story for about two months . I will still read and recommend books by Ahern, just not this one."
2,But it's fun....,"This CD sounds completely different from their later work, but it's still a lot of fun. Doug MacMillan's voice has definitely improved since this album, when it seems as if he was trying to emulate Morrissey. Reminds me of the college dorm and listening to The Smiths, old REM, and The Cure."
2,Unpolished first effort,"This album has muddy production, unrealized melodies, and a much more ragged sound than any of the subsequent Connells albums. For completists only."
2,Not as advertised...for me anyway.,"Great price, fast shipping, but not as advertised. They claim they can detect your pregnancy as early as 6-8 days after conception. I took several of these tests starting at 6 days and as late as 16 days after what should be the conception date based on my cycle - all negative. My husband and I decided to read the reviews we found on several sites for this product and the high number of low ratings prompted us to go buy another test from the drug store - first attempt I got the positive I was expecting based on things I knew were different with my body. I then took 3 more of these tests and they have all shown positive, but it was not until 17+ days of conception that they reflected the positive. I would not have wasted them as early as 6 days had I known that trait was falsely advertised. Additionally, 2 of the positives took more than 30 minutes to show the positive!"
1,NOT as sensitive as advertised,"These tests are NOT - I repeat, NOT anywhere near as sensitive as they claim. The other drug store brands such as EPT, First Response and ClearBlue are much more sensitive and reliable. I got a positive on all the above mentioned and this ""super sensitive"" ""early pregnancy test"" did not show a positive until days later. Even then, the test line was faint and not as dark as the control line. Finally NOW - I am over eight weeks pregnant and decided I already own these ridiculous things, might as well use them - now I get a bright purple test line. Don't buy them, they arrive quickly, but they don't show results early....they should be called ""later than all the rest pregnancy tests."""
2,So-so. Or not.,"It doesn't sag down on my calf, but it won't stay up on my thigh either so it ends up bunching up around my knee. Haven't really had it long enough to make too many other judgements but my first impression is about a 2 1/2 star impression. Take it or leave it. I'm sure there are better products out there.I've actually returned this item as the bunching up at the knee became more trouble than it was worth. Additionally, the mesh panel located behind the knee was uncomfortable and a huge irritation."
2,Dissappointed,"I should have listened to the other reviewers. This was much too large and even if it wasn't I doubt it would have stayed in place. I don't even know where it is right now, a waste of money."
2,Too large,I followed the measurements and it is too large..I tried to wear it but it kept falling down and defeats the purpose of why I purchased it...for support.
4,Ashes in our mouth....,"I too heard this on a Pittsburgh radio station that played alot of good, hard to find music. I eard the b-side song ""She's CooCoo"" by Siouxsie And The Banshees on that same now defunct station. Anyways, ""Glad I'm Not A Kennedy"" and ""Soviet Snow"" on that station and I sought this cd out. It is a very solid cd. The song about Kennedy is a bouncy pop song, but the loops of Kennedy's voice are chilling, especially the loop ""of nuclear war, of which even the fruits of victory will be ashes in our mouth"" I gave it 4 stars because even though all the songs are very well written and composed, they all don't appeal to me. I highly reccomend this cd though. It still stands solid after all these years, which is rare. You can tell a good cd if you still like it years later. I like this one!"
4,Shona Laing,"I've read every else's comments, and just wanted to mention that this woman has had a prodigious output, but, unfortunately, despite all her work and talent, she's never really made it big, and most of her music is out of print. Keep your eyes open on various auction sites and such, and pick up whatever you can."
4,"4 stars, i guess, whatever, it is kinda hard to tell........","Well...this is is a change, and a drastic one. One thing i noticed is that the songs are not as catchy as those from the first album, i definatly do not see 5 singles in the top 40 come out of ""Blue."" It is, however, good. My first impression was that it was okay, but that they had fallen in to the ""sophomore album trap,"" but with every go-around it seems to get better...It leaves me satisfied, but wanting more, and i will most definatly buy their third CD on its release date as i did this one...If you liked their first release, but want something a little harder, purcahce this one..."
3,Not as good as the first .......,"I really had high expectations for this CD because their first effort was so great. The first time I listened to ""Blue"", the first four songs blew me away. ""Never Let You Go"" and ""Wounded"" are excellent. But then after ""1000 Julys"" I became disappointed. Their first CD ended well, but the ending of this CD was not as strong. Still, this is a good CD ... it was just difficult to follow such a great debut CD."
5,Fingers catch the sparks...,"Listening to this album the first few times left me comparing it to the band's prior album, and at first I was disappointed. This sophomore release has a more edgy feel to it and takes some getting used to. ""Wounded"" and ""Deep Inside of You"" are tracks with Third Eye Blind's signature meaningful lyrics, and the rest of the songs will make you drum along with the catchy beats. The band's musical talent is further proved on Blue. There's a track for everyone on this album!"
2,Disappointed,"I must admit I was greatly disappointed in Third Eye Blind's follow up CD. Unlike their first album in which each of their songs were unique, the songs of Blue seem to run together. And no matter how many times you listen to it, this is not a CD that grows on you .... hopefully, their third CD will not be such a disappointment."
3,Worst of the 3 so far...,"I listened to this album again after Out of Vein came out to see if I had prematurely cooled on it, but found that it was still lacking. The arrogant guitar wanking of Kevin Cadogan is just obnoxious in comparison to the subtle and flavorful riffs of TEB's 1st and Out of Vein with Fredianelli. The first 5 songs are solid, Wounded being probably the best song Jenkins has written, but I can't listen after that. Darwin is one of the more annoying songs ever written and Slow Motion sans lyrics is empty. I'll give it 3 stars since I'm a huge fan, but it's definitly my least favorite."
3,"First half good, second half disappointing","I absolutely LOVED Third Eye Blind's first CD. I would put it in my CD player and leave it on repeat for hours, enjoying every minute, every second of it. Thus, I had high expectations for their sophomore album. Well, all I can say is that I've had this CD for two or three years now, and I still can't bear to go beyond track 7 when I listen to it. Even then, I often don't even make it that far--only the first 5 tracks are really worthwhile. Everything after that sounds like they just threw it together in the studio in about an hour and said ""Good enough."" I recommend this only to those who are willing to pay full price for half a CD. Everyone else, buy their first one if you haven't already."
2,Complete disapointment.,"After 3eb's stellar first album, i was looking forward to this one. After hearing it, i was really disapointed. There are only 3 or 4 decent songs on this album. ""Never Let You Go"" is the best by far. I was puzzled by the previous reviews, i'm just telling it like it is."
2,"Still Third Eye Blind?...yeah, that's funny","well, when i got this cd, i was expecting it to sound something like their first album, which i listened to Constantly! It had so much meaning to me, and i felt that it had alot of emotion-a big factor that I look for when I choose music. But, when I started to listen to Blue...I was like, ""This can't be them"". I didn't really care for the cd too much and thought it was too ""poppy"" I gave it a spin a couple more times, and it did kinda of grow on me. But, now I don't even listen to it hardly because I'm still expecting that depth that I got when I listened to that first album, and I'm not getting that with this album. So, I would try to sample it before I bought it if I were you....overall rating? so-so good."
2,A very poor quality cd,This cd did not live up to my expectations. I had hoped that it would be like their last album but it was not. I saw 3Eb in concert and I thought it was great. Now they have disappointed me. Please tell me if this was helpful.
4,A More Powerful Third Eye Blind,"Good CD with the exception of a couple of songs! This album proves them more as a major rock band & still manages to slip in a rocker,""Never Let You Go"", more catchy than ""Semi Charmed Life""! It's sort of a cross between ""Jesse's Girl"" & The Stone's classic ""Start Me Up"", with a dose of a modern Stephen Jenkins with his signature Semi Charmed wordplay & ending! Also ""Anything"" rocks hard, but not to hard for Top 40, it's still very catchy. Other standouts are ""Wounded"", ""Deep Inside Of You"", & ""Farther"". Overall it's a pretty good CD, and the band seems to have come together nicely & mastered their new more rock/less pop style with no problems maintaing catchy Songs & melodies!"
5,ONE word: Awesome,"Third Eye Blind has released another great cd. The popularity of their first album was outstanding. They return with their gripping lyrics and catchy guitar tunes. They have many new and fresh sounds. The cd is much smoother and betrays more of a goo goo dolls sound than a eve 6 sound. It is one of my favorite cd's since Splender's debut or Goo Goo Dolls: Dizzy up the girl. It is great, if you liked their last cd you'll love this one."
3,Not as good as their premiere release....,"I am a huge Third Eye fan and have been waiting for this release for a long time. Unfortunately I am somewhat disappointed. The songs are not as intense and the lyrics seem kind of high-schoolish. There is nothing on here that even comes close to God of Wine and Drive By. Plus the music tends to drown out Stephans voice. It also has a lot of odd sounds and weird transitions within the songs. The only song that somewhat saves me from being totally disappointed is Deep Inside Of You. It's not horrible, but it's not very great either."
4,Their new Blue CD left me hanging for more...,"I loved their first album, but this was ""da bomb!"" I really liked their thoughts in these songs. Very deep, and interesting"
3,Third Eye Blind - Great Music (and Beyond). Not Pop Music.,"An edit of a previous review.After my own musical sense evolved, I've realized I was wrong. I preserved the title so I could show that I was fairly wrong.This album of Third Eye Blind definitely has some pop elements to it, and it definitely diverged from the feeling of the Self-Titled.This album is pretty good for itself, but 3eb could've done so much better. They proved it was just a slip with their new album, ""Out of the Vein"".I recommend any 3eb fan to move on (like I did) and buy the new album."
3,It is OK,"Blue is not there best, it is just OK. I liked there 1st one the best. The only song I relay liked was 4: Never Let You Go."
4,"4 for music, 1 for compatibility","Less pop than their first CD, but still their style. I thought it was going to be the opposite of the style from the first CD, and though it is a little darker, it still carries songs I like to hear. Most notable are Never Let You Go, Deep Inside Of You, Darwin, and my favorite An Ode To Maybe. I would recommend this CD for those songs, though the others are nothing to cast away.One other note is I could not listen to this CD in my computer, or make a backup copy of it. I do this with all my CDs and listen to my CDs mainly on my computer, so this dismayed me. I do not know if it works with any CDROMs so who knows. But this is a major drawback to the CD."
5,Let it grow on you,"This album, given time, will become one of your favorites if you liked their first one. I considered myself a huge 3eb fan, but I didn't like this c.d. when it first came out. Now, a few months later, I can't get enough of it. I don't know what it is, but Jenkins is an incredible artist, I should have known this work would be as solid as the first.I read reviews by people, and they like to get all technical. I won't do that to you. All I need to say is that when I play ""1000 Julys"" on my guitar (or attempt to), I can't help but smile through the whole thing. And that, my friend, is what music is about."
5,5 stars does not do justice...,"I need say only that this album blew my pants off! I cannot get enough, does it get any better? im speechless, bye."
2,Made promises; Didn't deliver,"I selected this CD based on having heard one tune, ""Never Let You Go."" Big mistake. While this song is very good, the rest of the album failed to meet my expectations. I expected to hear more poppy tunes with quirky instrumentation, cool changes, and tight playing. The rest of the album may as well have been written and performed by a completely different band."
5,Incredible,This cd is flawless. I can't understand why so many people don't like it. Powerful songs like Anything and Wounded are enough to buy the cd. Ten Days Late is a great song. 1000 Julys are great for anyone who likes the harder 3eb stuff. Slow Motion is a great calm peaceful song. You may ask is it better than the last cd or Out of the Vein? It's hard to say because each 3eb album is worth getting. 3eb never comes out with a bad song.
5,GreaT!,"The first Third Eye Blind cd was the best, I thought the next never catch up with the 1st one. It did with a lot of great songs. My favorite is NEVER LET YOU GO! Itz the best on the cd!"
4,Change can be good.,"Blue is really ""different"" than the first CD. It took me a long time to get into it. There are some really annoying high-pitched voices on a couple of the songs but other than that the cd is worth buying. It is almost a different type of music than their first abulm but it still rocks and I would reccomend it to any fan of 3eb."
3,Half A Loaf,"I had high hopes for ""Blue"", since 3EB's debut was one of the best hard rock (hard pop?) albums of recent years. ""Blue"" starts off with promise, and the first several tracks contain all the elements that made the first album so great: strong songs with crunching hooks, intricate arrangments, good musicianship, and lyrics with a twist. In fact, two tracks are up there with the best of the first CD: ""10 Days Late"" and ""Never Let You Go"" -- although the latter may be destined for radio overplay. But something happens about midway through -- it's as if the band ran out of gas, and filled out the album with half-baked ideas. Hooks, melodies, even intelligble lyrics all disappear from sight. And to add insult to injury, the band tacks on about 13 minutes of silence to the last track before adding a one minute clip (I won't call it a song) of no value. In conclusion, put this down as a ""semi""-recommendation."
2,Disappointing Follow-Up,"""Blue"" is not even close to what Third Eye Blind achieved on their self-titled debut. Although there are a few good songs here (""Anything"", ""Never Let You Go"", ""Deep Inside Of You"") most of the CD sounds as though TEB was trying too hard to repeat the success of their previous release."
3,New CD doesn't go far,"After enthusiastically buying Blue, I was disappointed by the repetition as compared to the band's debut album. Many of the songs have similar structure (Anything to Losing a whole year, and Wounded to Narcolepsy), and 1000 Julys sounds almost exactly like a certain AC/DC song. If you bought the first album and are not buying it for ""Never let you go"" don't bother."
5,A Great CD!,"i bought this cd a couple days ago, and i've been listening to it ever since. at first i wasn't thrilled, but these songs grow on you. i loved 3EB's first album, so i rushed out to buy this. it's not the same. some people might say better, some might say worse. it's just different. my friend hated ""Blue"" but then, she liked the depressive tone of the first album. ""Blue"" has lighter lyrics, but the rhythm is a little bit slower than 3EB's first album. overall, this is a 5-star cd. it'll be a great addition to your collection. it only gets better every time you listen to it, and i love just reading the lyrics. they're like poetry."
3,"okay, but not as good","this cd was a good one for a third eye blind fan like me, but even i was disappointed by it. i hoped for it to be more of the same, except maybe better in some areas. the first five songs are the best, but after that it kinda stinks."
5,A Satisfied Fan,"I'm a long-time fan of 3EB and I was very excited when I first heard of their new album, I was very excited. I recently got the album and I love it as much as I do the last one. The music is great and I recomend it to any hardcore fan of alternative music. However, IT'S NOT EXPLICIT! I have no idea why all websites say it's explicit. There are only two swears in the entire album. Oh well, it's not my website. Buy the cd and enjoy. Trust me you will."
2,Blue and directionless,"I like the album, but that's because I'm a softy. The production is still as spotless as it was on their debut; musically, they've fallen into the same pop/rock Venus fly trap that ensnares all but the best modern groups. ""Ten Days Late"" is fun (""Funny how you always cried out daddy,"" he says!) and there's a good line in ""Camouflage"" (""We walk along like a sequel/You're a cameo""), but it just isn't really good, particularly in comparison with their debut, which I thought was a knockout. Listening to ""Blue,"" I bet they've never heard the Joni Mitchell album."
5,3eb/Blue Review,"Blue is an extension of the lyrical extravaganza Stephan Jenkins displayed in the first self- titled album. The music is alive, and the words of each song seem to jump out and grab the listener. Jenkins throws in a few words that may make some people uneasy, but there is an urgency in his voice as he sings the very true to life words of each track. For those of you who are being newly introduced to Third Eye Blind, both albums are worth listening to - this is a talented band, with a powerful lyricist as lead vocal."
4,Good Stuff,"It has cool cover art! Really, though, I've only listened to it 3 or 4 times straight thru since I got it, but its pretty cool as far as I can tell. Anything is cool for a 2 min song. Wounded- one of the best. Never Let You Go kind of represents the entire cd. Oh, and Camouflage is unique, but still cool, with some echoing stuff and some fast lyrics and a cool chorus. I recommend this and the original cd. Oh, and at the end of the last track, there's 15 minutes of silence followed by some more, odd music, and some laughing...Behold!"
1,Uninspired,"third eye blind is one of the worst artists on the rock scene today, just bad. Don't waste your money, (get the new weezer album when it comes out in the fall.)"
1,Major disappointment--get their debut instead,"Words cannot express my dismay at this album. Their debut to me was a five-star masterpiece of pop-rock. It was simple, but good. Somehow, 3EB has managed to keep essentially the same sound (simple hooks, singable choruses) yet this album is so much worse.The passion and energy of the first album are gone. When Stephan Jenkins sings ""I'll never let you go,"" it's like a wimpy pop ballad gone wrong; when he sings about his girl being ""Ten days late,"" it's unconvincing and flat. Song after song on this album have that unmistakeable sound yet they all fail to match the power of the first album. I might have given it 2 stars if it weren't such a BIG let down."
5,Third Eye Blind- Blue,"To respond to fan in Wisconsin, I went to see 3eb in Louisville this weekend and they were fantastic...and no I am not a teeny bopper who just saw her first concert...this was my 5th 3eb show...and they did perform Camoflauge and Farther...beautifully I must add...so if you don't know where you are coming from, don't bother!"
2,Not compareable to their debut album.,"I must say, there was evidence of hard-work, but Third Eye Blind just couldn't pull it off. No songs grabbed my attention like Semi-Charmed Life, Graduate, or How's It Gonna Be. Jenkins sometimes broke out into an annoying wine, and a high-pitched sound that was a bit annoying. The only two songs that I enjoyed were ""Anything"" and ""Never Let You Go"", and still these songs didn't spark anything inside of me. One of the things that absolutely shocked me is that one of their songs has a vulgar and horrible meaning! Slow Motion (on their album) is about wife-beating and the alike! Another thing is that, most bands I like I stay loyal to, so I automatically like their songs, but this album didn't make me stay loyal to 3eb. I prefer their debut album.If you haven't gotten their debut album, get it, it is much better than this one."
4,"Not as stellar as the first album, but still a pleaser.","Now I didn't like this album as much as Third Eye Blind's debut, but then again, nothing can compare the that album. If this album didn't have to live up to the first albums reputation, it would have been superb. Im not saying it's bad, it's far from it. It's just not as good as the first. The boys from 3EB go for a little less rocking out this time around. But they still please. With songs like Anything, Never Let You Go and 1000 July's they've proved to me the first album wasn't just luck, they are a band who plan to stay around a while."
2,not great,"i loved the self-titled first cd of 3EB. it ranks as one of my all-time favorites. the songs were perfect. 'blue' is alright, but is, by no means, as good as the first album. it left me cold and disenchanted. the songs didn't have the evocative, raw quality of the first album and i was really disappointed. i do like 'anything'. but that's about all i like about 'blue'."
5,A great new sound for an EXCELLENT band,"This sophmore effort is a great continuation of the previous album. Third Eye Blind has seemed to mature in their musical abilities and have created an even more original sound. Singer Stephan Jenkins is once again brilliant. THIS CD IS AMAZING. Though some have said this album is not characteristic of 3eb, it is simply a more advanced and complex music. 3eb is the most amazing band ever....and this album supports this clearly!"
2,Poor Follow-Up,"""Blue"", Third Eye Blind's second studio album, is really not even comparable to their self-titled debut. Although there are a few bright spots (""Anything"", the CD's best song, and ""Deep Inside Of You""), most of the CD sounds forced and too much like the debut (""Never Let You Go"" being a perfect example). All in all a very disappointing result from a band that appears to be in some trouble, with this CD and with the departure of guitarist Kevin Cadogan."
2,Second album a disappointment,"I have long been a fan of Third Eye Blind and considered it one of my favorite bands. I enjoyed their first album immensely and listened to it many times. Though people complained about their rough sound, I appreciated the pure rock of ""Third Eye Blind"". ""Blue"", however, is completely different. 3EB's crossover into pop is a disappointment to me. Their style has changed immensely. (One or two of the songs even faintly reminded me of Savage Garden) Though I can see how that might appeal to many new people, it's a different audience than the fans of the old Third Eye Blind. Frankly, the thrill of the old 3EB is gone, replaced with a more ""acceptable"" (albeit boring and cliched) sound."
3,anything for you,"anything, wounded, and deep inside you hold this album together. which is good-but what happened to the 'semi-charmed' outlook on life? this cd is a sour note compared to the previous one. i wish i could say i loved it, but i think it is against my religion to lie..."
4,Wounded,"Even though reviewers and critics have somewhat bashed this CD, Let it be known from a listener's point of view that this is indeed a great album. My favorites are Anything, Wounded, 10 Days Late, Never Let you Go, Deep Inside of you, Farther, and Slow MOtion. In case you didn't notice, that's 7 out of the 13 tracks on this CD. It's good the first time you hear it, great the second time, and Excellent everytime after that. It hasn't left my CD player in a week and a half. BUy it, if you are any kind of 3eb fan, you'll dig this album, if you've never heard them, shame on you, get both albums, the first one ROCKS, and the second one is a great follow-up. I LOVE THIRD EYE BLIND!"
4,Very good but like the first there are none!,"This album is very good. The sound is a bit different but sometiems change is good! My personal favourite is ""wounded"", but ""deep inside of you"", ""the red summer sun"" and even the instrumental ""slow motion"" are all good. I dont know if ANY album can top Their first(3eb) but this one is way better than most band's sophomore albums! BOTTOM LINE: BUY IT! ITS WORTH THE MONEY."
3,"i have already written this review, but i need help...","um, i was just wondering:where are the explicit lyrics on this cd? would someone who knows please e-mail me by double-clicking on my name? just in case, i want you to know that this cd is pretty cool, even though i didn't think it was quite as good as the first one! fav tracks: Wounded, deep inside of you, anything to avoid: darwin, ode to maybe (sorry to those who like those)!"
4,"""Blue"" takes 3eb into another direction","Not the debut, ""Blue"" offers a different side to the band that most of its fans may not understand. Compared to the incredible songs of their first self-titled, this one offers a little more choices, musically that is. ""Blue"" is an experimental playground where machines and music mix. Somewhat engineered, the music can be described as ""outthere"", at times.However, this is still a very good album. It was a great risk from 3eb to take when changing their ""hit making"" sound into another form that was more appropriate and true to them. There is no doubt that they will lose some of their 30 something yuppie following (those who overplayed ""Jumper"" and ""How's it Gonna Be""), but the hard-core 3eb fans will appreciate their musical integrity and their ability to still rock."
4,"not bad, not bad at all","the songs are on par with the previous release from third eye blind. i especially like the thumpin' song, 1000 julys -- it's just fun to listen to with the windows down on the highway."
4,Pure pop heaven,"Just like their debut, ""Blue"" is an exciting collection of wonderful pop songs. Expect to hear plenty of singles on the radio in the new year."
4,Listen more than once!,"WOW! Have the SF guys bitten off more than they can chew? At first listen, one might think just that. But, hold on kids, fasten those seatbelts and hit ""repeat"" on your CD player. ALthough ""Blue"" is not filled with hooks like the first album (although I have to admit that ""Anything"" has been running thru my head all day!) it pays off big. The guys aren't afraid to take some chances and have fun and you can hear the result. No instant classics here that you listen to for a week and then tire of. Each song has a personality of it's own. But, can they still Rock? Hell Yeah! And they can also dazzle with slow tempo gems like ""Slow Motion"". This is definately a ""must have"" this holiday season. But again, please give it a few listens OK?"
2,Sophomore Slump......,"What a shame..... The first is album is great from end to end but ""Blue"" fails to live up to its predecessor. There are only about 3 or 4 solid songs on this CD. The album is self-produced and it shows. There is some really bad(see experimental) vocal work on it (""An Ode To Maybe"" and ""The Red Summer Sun"") that probably would have been cut by a decent producer. The majority of the songs fall under ""experimental"" and the result is a disjointed, disappointing second CD."
4,Can't surpass the first,"while not bad, this CD is not as good as 3EB's debut. Some songs are really good, like ""Deep Inside of You"", and ""Never Let You Go"". Also, the instrumental ""Slow Motion"" is suprisingly good. A lot of 3EB fans are going to be disappointed in their sophomore album, and rightfully so......they seem to be more ""pop"" now, rather than the more ""alternative"" they were before. Overall, it is worth buying."
3,you guys are da bomb wa sup,yo yo yo this cd aw right i dig what you are doin in this album i bought it yo and me and my homies hang in my crib and listen to it like holla holla peace out mofo
1,"I HATE ""NEVER LET YOU GO"" !","I hate the song ""Never Let You Go"" because it stuck in my head and never gets out. It is also very annoying"
1,A sorry excuse for a rock album,"The only reason I bought this album was because of the catchy single 'Never Let You Go', I thought is was a cool song, so I bougbought the album. When I got home, I put it into my cd player, I didn't like the 1st song, so I skipped to the next song, I liked it, listened 1/2 way through the 3rd song, and skipped it, the I got to 'Never Let You Go' I loved it. Then as the record went on I notice I was going to sleep, maybe because the rest of the album [is bad].This is a sorry excuse for a rock album, by a sorry excuse for a rock band. 3 words: bland, boring, and ridiculous. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS ALBUM!"
3,Giant Disappointment,"After a wonderful first album, one that is probably one of my all time favorites, Third Eye Blind came out with this. It essentially feels and sounds like they have left where they started and gone somewhere else. This album has a strong pop feel and is way too mainstream. Yes, the first album had both of those also but they didn't permeate the sound. I can honestly say I didn't even somewhat like this album until the third time I listened through it. Even now after many more times listening to it I still only really like Darwin with Slow Motion and Red Summer Sun tied for 2nd. It isn't the worst cd ever made but it pales in comparison to what the first one was. Also I wanted to give 2 and a half stars but no such rating exists (rats!) and I decided it deserved better than 2 so I gave it 3."
2,Thick and less lyrical,"I was disappointed by this CD, relative to 3EB's earlier release.What I really liked about their earlier release was the balance between powerful, driving music and inventive melodic lyricism. To my ears, Blue doesn't share this balance. It is heavy, thick, and loud, but not clever or fun. Jenkins and company have great skill and I'm eager to see future releases, but this didn't live up to my hopes. (In contrast, Green Day's ""Warning"" was very good.)"
3,the first was better,the first album was a lot better. This c.d. is still better than any teenie bopper music out there. And to say that the fire in third eye blind is gone is unfair. everybody realeases 1 flopy album. but they get back on track.
3,GOOD POP MUSIC THOUGH NOT AS GOOD AS ITS PREDECESSOR.,"Third Eye Blinds ""Blue"" is their latest album which is good.But I feel it is lacking from their last selftitled CD.There are some good pop songs like ""Wounded"" and ""Never Let You Go"", however the CD loses ground with filler songs.I like Third Eye Blind, they make good pop music I just feel this CD doesn't have the strength or feel of the first.I definitely recommend it to die hard fans, but if you are a new Third Eye fan try their last album first."
2,Save Your Money,Utterly disappointing. No more than two or three good songs. The rest are just boring or dumb. Absolutely nothing original on this CD. Doesn't even come close to matching their first CD.
5,Beautiful CD - Well Produced,"I was not a fan of Thrid Eye Blind before ""Blue"" was released. In fact, I viewed 3rd EB as a corporate band with extensive radio play. But, the song ""Never Let you Go"" caught my attention forcing me to purchase ""Blue."" It is a great Alternative disc, echoing the subtle noises and chrosus of Billy Corgan. The CD is well put together and is thankfully the type that can be enjoyed in full. It is great listening. Highly Recommended!"
1,blue misses the mark,"Bland, unoriginal, a poor copy of the original albulm (which was good). This band lacks the sophistication to progress musically over time; instead, they decline."
1,Not growing on me,"I bought this album based on the first single ""Never Let You Go"". Boy am I sorry. I thought maybe if I continued to listen it would grow on me, but that just isn't the case.I would say skip this unless you find it used."
1,THE SOUND OF BEING PAID,"There is very little innovative about Third Eye Blind . Although I bought into their catchy song ""Semi-Charmed Life"" off their first album , I later found Third Eye Blind an easily forgetable band . With their new album album ""Blue"", they deliver corporate rock at it's finest . Along with their brethren Tonic and Matchbox 20 , they produce catchy , yet meaningless songs for the listener who does not expect much from the music they listen to . Alot of people enjoy music like this . But for the serious music fan , Third Eye Blind is mindless drivel ."
2,A Disappoinment,"After the quality of the first recording, I expected a lot more from a sophomore effort. Boring, is a good word for this CD. Go get the new Stone Temple Pilots, or even the new Filter. I don't know what happed to Third Eye Blind, but they'd better go back to the original formula."
1,Third Eye Blinder,"Well, what can I say this CD is about as bad as any other teen hit band. Bad lyrics, elementary guitar lics and drum fills bombard the listener and you basically leave feeling stupider. Whats wrong Third Eye Blind, you aren't getting payed enough? What these guys need is some music lessons, but in the meantime please don't rush out and buy this CD!"
1,"One Song, One Star","I was surprised about how good the first record was. Anthemic songs that reverberate and haven't gotten old. I really liked it after the first listen, even if all the kids were digging it, and my friends were ripping on me for liking it (and saying so).The first song on ""Blue"" kicks in the same way.The rest is overblown ""we have to spend the advance money on something other than cars and girls"" garbage. Whatever. I was so embarrased when I bought this that I picked up 2 John Zorn cd's just to balance it out, hoping for the best.Now I feel justified. John Zorn makes music. Third Eye Blind (unfortunately) makes money."
2,THE FIRST ONE WAS MUCH BETTER,"Even if their first album was labled as sounding like ""Corporate Rock"" it was still much much better. This CD, while maybe being more ""artistic"" really has no memorable songs. 3Eb's first album was by far more entertaining, with many more ""radio ready"" songs that you easily got stuck in your head.If your thinking of buying this CD try and listen to it first and I think you'll change your mind.For anyone that has the first CD, don't buy this one; it will only disappoint you."
5,Please Buy this CD,"First off, please, do yourself a favor and go out and buy this CD. Ok, here is the review. This is one of the best CDs i have bought in a while, and i buy alot. Not only is the music good, but lyrically, it is unreal. Now for the songs. I am sure you have heard of anything and never let you go, so i do not need to explain them. Track # 2, Wounded, is worth the price of the album alone. The way it goes from a slow paced, to a fast paced song is great, and the lyrics are good. I do not want to explain any more songs, so i dont ruin them. Stop reading this, and go buy the cd."
5,ROCK ON 3EB!,"Their first album was a blast. Their second is even better. They have totally evolved from their first cd. It seems they have a totally different sound, yet it is in tastefull 3eb fashion. I loved it! It will stay in my cd player for a loooooong time. I recommend you go out AND BUY THIS CD, DAMMIT!"
3,Disappointing Sophomore Effort,"I'm a listener who is open to change from my favorite musician's however, this 2nd effort has let me down. The album has several songs which are strong, however the album doesn't seem to have any cohesive sound. There are several songs, where it seems the group is reaching for a totally different sound. The eighth tracks begins with a solid groove then drifts off into a VERY AC/DC like banter, why? If you are looking for an album that is fantastic, from start to finish, check out the new FOO FIGHTERS."
5,"Blue is a great cd, many different sounds","When i first bought this cd i thought it was going to be the same kind of music you hear over and over on the radio, bu this cd offers all kinds of different varieties. Some the songs are harder than the songs on their last cd. It is a great alternative/rock cd. One of my favorites since the Splender debut and goo goo dolls last cd. If you like teb you'll love this cd!"
5,Blue.... Makes you feel anything but,"I really beleive that this CD sends a very powerful message. It clearly states that the past glory of Third Eye Blind is far from over. In fact, it may be just beginning. This is the type of CD that makes you wonder if this is their best album ever? or can they keep it coming better every time? If you liked their first CD you'll love Blue. And if you've never heard the first one, I don't see how it can matter. This CD is amazing."
5,the best album I have ever heard,"this cd is awesome. steven jenkens is the best lyricist of all time. if you think anybody is better, buy this cd and you'll know how wrong you were. the album is filled with powerful, awesome songs that mean a lot. this album helped me through a really tough time in my life. i would reccomend it to anyone. really"
3,Deep in the Blues,"If you loved 3EB's first effort, you will probably like this one too, but not as much. It has some catchy songs (Anything, Never Let You Go) but 1000 Julys sounds like a cheap knockoff of their classic Semi-Charmed. I was looking forward to this one for a long time, and was disappointed. But that does not mean it is a bad collection either."
5,They've done it again!,"If you liked their self-titled CD. Them you may or may not like Blue. Not quite as instantly catchy as the first but, it is still wonderful. To those of you who loved their first album I have this advice: Don't expect it to sound anything like the first.Listen to it a few times. Then I assure you it will become another one of your absolute favorite CD's."
5,WOW!,"This is one of the best albums that I own to this date! It rocks! 10 days late is the best song. The lyrics in the song ""Slow Motion"" are worth listening to. There are some crazy words in there but hey, it still rocks. 3EB should take a trip to the ohio valley, cause everyone at my school has to hear them play!"
5,The Most Under-Rated Album of '99,"I love this album. It's dark and brilliant. If you're not listening to it because you think Third Eye Blind is too mainstream, give it a try. My favorite tracks are ""Anything,""Deep Inside of You,"" and ""1000 Julys."" I think the songs wrap up a lot of energy, anger, and sadness in a rock beat that you can dance to, with lyrics you can sing along with...A great album if you've had a bad day and you want to get it all out."
3,A BLUE ALBUM,"This album was OK. There was nothing special except Anything. Never Let You Go, Deep Inside Of You, 10 Days Late, and Wounded are good but the rest are mediocre pop rock songs. The love topic 3EB uses gets annoying but not enough not to buy this album. Every song on the debut was great but Blue fell short. 3EB can play the guitar well, but Stephen Jenkins' voice can get annoying. I suggest buying ""Third Eye Blind"" and if you like that one buy this one too. B"
2,"ok for teens, not mature enough for adults","This CD is okay music-wise, but the lyrics are depressing! I don't know how anyone could enjoy a song like Ten Days Late, which is about an unwanted pregnancy, and the immature, selfish reaction to it.Deep Inside of You is almost as bad. 3eb often writes about pathetic, manipulative relationships.There is nothing good, happy or spiritual to listen to here. It is all about obssesion with carnality and the misery that lifestyle creates.If you are a teen go ahead and buy this CD. You may be able to relate, but if you are an adult pass! This stuff is beneath you."
3,new style,"much heavier than first album, but a nice change. i would recommend this to all 3eb fans, even if you just liked the ""radio songs"" off the 1st album"
4,GOOD INFORMATIVE BOOK,"THS IS A GOOD BOOK. SHE GIVES YOU GOOD EXERCISES, HOWEVER, I THINK THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE MAIN POINTS AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH CHAPTER (WITH BULLET POINTS) WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE IT EASIER FOR THE READER RATHER THAN HAVING TO READ THROUGH EACH AND EVERY CHAPTER TO GET THE MAIN PONTS OF EACH CHAPTER."
5,Even better than 'Now or Never',"I had gotten 'Now or Never' first, and while I liked it, it was waaaaaaaay too advanced for me (and I've been exercising for a year now!). I like the concepts she uses, and I do apply pyramiding to some of my routines, but some exercises (as she says in Bottoms Up) you'll find you can pyramid, and some you can't. So true!I also liked the VERY sensible nutrition plan, but 'Bottoms Up' I think is a much, much more comprehensive book on fitness and nutrition than 'Now or Never'. She goes into much more detail on both topics. I wish I had gotten this one first!Ah well - they're both good books, just if you're a beginner, start with Bottoms Up! If you're looking for a challenge and want to add a wollop to your workout - get Now or Never. :)But all in all, I really like Joyce Vedral's book so far, and plan on checking out 'Hardbodies' she co-authored with Gladys Portuguese :)"
4,Gilded Priest,"He had a gilded youth, and it carried over into his preisthood,He had a powerful impression on young people who met hm"
4,Good but has its issues,"I've purchased a few other TV theme CDs hoping to get the themes I like, only to be extremely disappointed. Most of the themes on this disc do appear to be authentic. There are, however, some issues.Specifically, I bought this disc for the ""Midnight Calller"" and ""Sledge Hammer!"" themes. The ""Midnight Caller"" theme clocks in at 1:32, and maybe it's just my bad memory, but I don't remember the first 0:52 as part of the aired theme.The ""Sledge Hammer!"" theme, however, went the other way. It clocks in at 0:48, and the theme is accurate right up to the point where Sledge says ""Trust me, I know what I'm doing"". On this disc, they cut out that line, the bullet firing, and the glass shattering. The entire theme builds up to that, so to omit those 4-5 seconds is unforgivable, as it completely ruins the theme."
4,One Of The Best In The Collection!,"Vol 6 and Vol 7 are probably the best in the Television's Greatest Hits collection, Vol 7 has some great themes, The Simpsons, Saved By The Bell, Major Dad, Blossom, Full House, Empty Nest, Family Matters, Fresh Prince Of Bel-air, Home Improvement, Mad About You, It's Gary Shandling's Show, The Nanny, Quantum Leap, etc."
5,"As usual, a terrific collection","As with the other ""Television's Greatest Hits"" collections, this is a great compilation and a wonderful, heart-warming time capsule. It's amazing that seven volumes in, they still had a plethora of entertaining themes available to collect. A must-have for any die-hard fan of classic TV."
2,Poorly Edited...disappointing for the $,"I bought this in an effort to understand my daughter's dyslexic/dysgraphic issues. The quality of the DVD is poor, with obviously no attempt at editing an on-line presentation. The information is good however I was frustrated by the lack of quality as well as the umms and ahs of these renown speakers. I could have read the slides myself and gotten as much out of the presentation. Very little in depth discusion was offered. I realize that there is very little information out there regarding Stealth dyslexia and handwriting,therefore it is easy for these folks to take advantage of parents who are desparate for the information. I am disappointed to say the least."
2,sheet,the quality and feel is nice. it was just too small for our basinet. would work perfectly for the nature's purest basinet mattress.
3,Okay Reference,"I bought this book primarily because of the review by: W. Oliver ""scudder"" which mentions the ""Plant Selector"" feature. It would be a great help if it were accurate. I was particularly interested in being able to cross-reference plants by acid-loving and deer-resistant features. I know that deer will eat anything if hungry; however, many sources from garden centers to university bulletins (and my own experience) note that hostas and tulips are deer candy. Both of these plants are listed deer resistant. Additionally, hollies are also listed as deer resistant. This fall, deer turned my new 8' holly into a topiary! Other than the ""Plant Selector"" feature, I'm not sure why I need this book along with the A-Z Encyclopedia of Garden Plants. To anyone else considering buying the package, I would recommend you don't do it."
2,"Common name, please","VERY thorough but the vast majority listed do not include the common name, not even in a crossref table/index, which makes it too tough to discuss with family, friends, neighbors. I had to return the book."
3,A Home Depot catalog,"It is a landscaper's plant selection guide, got thousands of nice thumbnails of common flowers and plants by habitats."
3,average or a little above,It is vary hard to find any thing in this book. If I knew what kind of plant it was or its proper name I would not need the book. If it takes a plant expert to use it thay don't need it. I don't know if a plant is anual or preanual or what ever.
3,Intersting book,"An intersting book. However, it has some minor flaws.Not enough effort was made to look at the issue from a Persian perspective as well. Thus it has a Western bias. E.g. Alexander is referred to as the 'Great' yet Cyrus is deprived of that title. From an Eastern perspective Cyrus created a civilized and fair empire while Alexander killed and destroyed.The author claims that the motives for the Persians freeing the Jews were purely economical and for empire building. Yet the bulk of evidence indicated that the reasons were infact humanitarian.Also the author claims that the religion of Iran at the time was dulaistic. This is also doubtful as they believed in Ahura Mazda (= The Wise Lord) as the creator of all things."
2,"Good service, but no go",My old Epson printer did not recognize this cartridge when inserted. I contacted both Amazon and Rhinotek. I returned through Amazon and was immediately credited. Rhinotek was also very responsive. I ended up getting the OEM cartridge refilled at Cartridge World for a few dollars more and it works OK.
4,Solid album start to finish,Best album from the band since philadelphonic. Very well produced with a different sound from his previous albums but still representing the band's roots. A lot of fun to listen to and I'm sure will be excellent on the headphones walking down the street.
3,hmmm.....,"Not at all what I expected. Jack Johnson produces some great stuff, just look at Donavon. Dissapointing mostly though. It's just G. Love on this one and I figured it'd be way more acoustic. If that's what you want, don't get this album. I dont know where his roots went on this one. Maybe he's progressing into new areas. I'm not trying to discourage anyone, just, this album wasn't what I wanted or expected. Take care. Buy Philadelphonic though, that album is very tight."
2,So disappointing!,"I was really happy to find out about this book. Our child is off to college and recipes for two sounded perfect.There are very, very few recipes for two. There is a chapter on party recipes, a chapter on holiday recipes (with the kids back at home) a chapter on passing down those family favorites, and even one for dinners on nights the kids visit.The chapter on skillet dinners for two contains as many recipes for 4 as it does 2. I also question the authors idea of a portion size. While she mentions 4 oz of protein, her recipes are much larger: Peppered Jack Daniel's Steak which claims to serve two calls for 4 rib eye steaks. The fish recipes for two call for anything from 1 1/2 to 2 lbs of fish.The menu suggestions for dinners for two contain all those serves 6-10 people recipes. No mention of decreasing the recipes or hints to make large batches smaller or freezing in portions. While the recipes look tasty, the book is not what it was advertised to be.All in all a disappointment."
4,To Kool,"I just luved this song when i First heard it, so I asked my freind who sang it, now i am gonna buy it. My fav rap is Snoop Dogg and others ( 2pac,Dr.Dre) but this was cool, if U like the slirred i-am-high-on-something voice,something to make U laugh or a phrase to hum, get this CD"
3,Be With You,"A decent alternative rock album for the time period. Primary singer has a deep voice (not as deep as the Mmm Mmm Mmm guy, though). ""Be With You"" was a single that got some airplay on alternative radio and MTV -- if you like that, you'll probably enjoy the rest of the CD. ""Horse with no name"" is an interesting cover choice."
4,"At one time, unbeatable","When was this published, 1985? I don't have a copy in front of me. But it gave the clearest, best organized and most graphic overview of major trails and routes in the Grand Canyon, from Lee's Ferry downriver to the Hualapai Rez of all the books I consulted. There are photocopies of topographic maps along with plain and concise descriptions of the nature and history of each trail. If you can get a copy, just keep in mind thatA) access issues have changed, in a number of places, andB) the author assumes top fitness in the reader, and some willingness to scramble, if not actually downclimb. So, be realistic about your own abilities."
1,It got worse.,"Ah, more garbage from our Brazilian friends. If you haven't seen this you do not know the true meaning of pain. DO NOT BUY THIS. You will scar yourself, your children, and your children's children for all eternity."
1,Another one.,I watched these on youtube and now I'm coming on Amazon to do a public service by warning parents not to waste thier money on this crap! Imagin a child asking for Kungfu Panda. Then thier parents see this in the store and buy it insteadXD Its just horrible! If you want your child to love you forever stay away from this!
2,Too bulky,"Maybe it is just a matter of wrong size, but this bra is too bulky and rigid for me. The two cups are also slightly different in shape. I don't think I will wear it. I have exactly the same size (32E) of another model from Fantasie and it is perfect."
1,I can't believe the rave reviews for this bra...,I just double checked the style number now to make sure I had the right bra because I can't believe all of the positive reviews. I am a 34DDD in nearly every size but apparently I am not in this one. I had muffin tops where my boobs were overflowing the cups and the straps were thin and very elasticy. I can't imagine feeling support even if I bought a cup size up. If felt like most Victoria Secret bra's for me where I have to re-adjust the straps three times a day because the metal thing keeps sliding down. I am glad it is doing it's job for so many other women out there but sadly it did not work for me.
2,Madona called...she wants her cones back,"The bra itself is a lovely material, appears well made, etc. However, once it's on, it's stiff and uncomfortable and creates an awkward pointy profile typically seen in the 60's. I returned it and got a swift refund."
5,The best bra I own!,"I absolutely love this bra. There is zero show through, and it fits seamlessly. Wear the nude color under your tightest white top and you still won't see the bra or what's beneath it. It's padded for support, not for size (at least on the larger cup sizes). Support is unparalleled, and it's very comfortable. It's by far the best bra I own.The best part is that it comes in a wide variety of cup sizes, many of which you (unfortunately) won't find through Victoria's Secret or other common retailers. Very highly reccomended!"
5,"""You lift me uuuup...""","Fantasia? Fantastic! This over the shoulder boulder holder makes me look and feel fully supported! Flawlessly seamless under t-shirts and sturdy, as the day is long."
3,very supportive,"This bra will work wonders for some. I bought one when I was pregnant and went up to a 34 F. This is bar none the most supportive bra I've ever owned. That being said... I just ordered another, since I've gone down a cup size and I'm not all that happy with the way it shapes me. It gives me that 'torpedo' boob look. I think it's because the cups are so molded they don't give to your natural breast shape at all, so I ended up with a bit of extra bra right at the tips of the cups which was not at all flattering. I am regretfully returning this one to continue on my likely neverending quest for the perfect bra!"
5,My most beloved knitting book.,"I acquired the Starmore books in real time, not knowing they'd sell for hundreds on EBay. Pacific Coast Highway is by far my favorite. I've made 3 sweaters from it but I've also taken design ideas and applied them to other projects. The photography is stunning.I see the disappearance of a lot of great Starmore books as a cautionary tale...get it while it's in print for you may have to pay a fortune later. I've seen Pacific Coast Highway sell for 600 dollars US.If you can see a copy, you'll find lovely, timeless designs, gorgeous detail and fit with a winning color palette. It is definitely worth learning to substitute yarns."
4,Pacific Coast Highway ~ Alice Starmore,The book is beautiful and all that I had hoped with the exception of smelling very musty. Never the less it is now in its permanent home with my other Starmore books.
3,Poor production hurts this debut,"I am one of the few fans of the band Thirdmoon. I have never talked to anyone else who has ever heard this band, but they have produced some really great music. They do a great job of combining excellent songwriting with a mixture of classical guitars and good old fashioned death metal. There are a lot of bands that are a lot flashier in this genre. There are other bands that play more intricate solos and utilize clean vocals more effectively. But Thirdmoon has something special about its music. It's how they layer acoustic guitars over blazing riffs (Timeless Dissent) and how they texture the music (Crimson Crescent). However, the sound quality for this album is quite bad and has made me give it three stars. I highly recommend their follow-up Aquis Submersis and their masterpiece Bloodforsaken, which both have much better recording quality and top notch songwriting."
4,Fun but too much Steady State,"This step routine has interesting choreography and fun music. Petra's cueing is good and after a couple of tries it can be mastered. The problem I have is that athletically, it's not challenging. In-between each combo there are too many hamstrings, side kicks and knee repeaters as fillers where I have to do jumping jacks, high knees, or plyo jumps to keep going. I also used 3 risers on each side to increase intensity. I like the routine and it's a lot of fun, but I don't get the workout I want. If you like steady state cardio and more complex choreography, this one is for you."
3,Color isn't always an improvement,"A colorized serial condensed to feature movie length isn't a bad way for viewers unfamiliar with classic cliffhangers to get a taste of what they were like. This one boasts Charles Quigley (from ""Daredevils of the Red Circle"") as the hero criminologist, lovely Linda Stirling (from ""Tiger Woman,"" ""Zorro's Black Whip"" and other first-class serials), and Clayton Moore (TV's Lone Ranger as the BAD guy, chief henchman to the title character). It has a fight between Quigley and Moore (actually, their stunt doubles) in which the hero seems to run up a wall before leaping back into the fray. This isn't exactly what the original serial was like but, until that comes along, this will do nicely. And, while I wouldn't make a habit of it, it is kind of interesting to see one of these in garish color."
3,Heavily Condensed,"Edited from 12 serial episodes down to a scant 90 minute running time, this colorized version of the celebrated serial is a bit jumpy in spots. The editors attempt to keep the ""serial"" feel by retaining use of ""chapter title cards"" in the film. Although colorization will offend some purists (of which I am generally one), it is actually quite effective with this particular film."
1,Very Poor,"The book is very poorly written. I ended up throwing it in the garbage after beating my head against the wall a number of times.Some of the critical reasoning answers will boggle your mind.I have done exams from other companies including ETS, and I have never seen such poorly written questions and answers. Definitely not worth the 40 dollars. If you can find it in the bargain bin, then pick it up."
1,Poor on Sentence Correction,"I bought a slightly different version of this book at the book store and I don't believe that the sentence correction questions in it are representative of what will be on the GMAT. And even if they are, the explanations for why each answer was correct were very week and hard to understand. The book ""Cracking the GMAT"" had very thourough explanations for each sentence correction problem so that you could really understand why each answer was wrong or right. I did not bother using this book for any other aspects of the GMAT because I thought the sentence correction section was so poor."
1,Wrong answers and explanations,I haven't read the instruction part of the book. Just grabbed it and went to the three practice tests at the end. I found many answers and explanations obviously wrong. And even those with a correct answer are very vague. Not worth the time.
4,"Great cap. Always gets a comment, and has a story to go along with it.","This has become my go-to cap. It seems like every time I am out and about someone will ask about it. The most common guess is Oregon in the wrong color. When I tell them that it's actually a throwback Orioles cap, people are always surprised, and more than once it has sparked a conversation about the original Orioles franchise moving to NY and becoming the New York Highlanders and then the Yankees, our now-despised rival."
3,Seek Out The Original Mix,"Raw Power is a great album, but this updated re-mix/ re-master does not do it justice. Sure, the original is a nightmare from any kind of technical viewpoint, but that was part of the original creation. and it's appeal. It was the result of clueless junkies who had no idea how to produce or mix a record properly, and it was art. I dock this release one star for the atrocity of altering a classic. To me this whole thing is nothing more than just louder and more distorted. It could have been remastered and retained it's integrity, but the re-mixing just stinks."
2,Raw Crap,"For those not in the ""know"" there are TWO Raw Power's. The origional from 1973 produced by David Bowie which is a classic. Then around 1997 the record company forced Iggy to remix (not remaster BUT remix) the album. You don't alter the Mona Lisa, why alter Raw Power?The result is a nearly unlistenable mess. Iggy cranked the recording levels so high some tones are lost from the origional recordings.There are bootlegs and demo's out there with better quality than this thing...good luck finding the origional CD or vinyl that was available before this masterpiece was ruined."
4,Little did I know.....,"Well im not gonna go into the remix, because i never had the opportunity to hear the original version to even compare the remix to. But seriously, where have I been the past 33 years? The 24 years ive been alive and Ive never ventured into the world of Iggy Pop and the Stooges. I regret every minute I wasted. This album is so full of force and intensity. I read that the band was falling apart during the making of this album, and you can feel the tension being put into the music. Iggy's vocals are just so darn good, I cant even describe it. Why have I wasted my life not listening to this album? Someone slap me"
3,Remix too distorted for such a great album,"I had the first CD issue of this album and I was disappointed with the sound, so when I heard their was a remix coming out done by Iggy himself, I traded away my original and ran out to get this one. Now, I wish I had kept the other one. This remix is way too distorted. I can barely bring myself to listen to it. What a shame because it is truly one of the great punk albums of all time. I think that the remix could have been great if it wasn't mixed so hot."
4,"Not a true Stooges album, but a damn good album nonetheless","Without Ron Asheton's guitar and Dave Alexander's bass, this can not truly be called a Stooges album. However, if you view it as a good and raw rock 'n' roll album, it is, well, good and raw! Great dancing music. One of the first punk bands by far, and truly raw power. How can one not just rock out or turn the speakers up as loud as they can go when listening to ""Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell"" or ""Death Trip""? Don't even ask me to choose which Stooges album is my favorite, I love them all like I'd love my own children."
4,"not crazy about the mix, but it still kills",The songs are still great and Iggy's remix can't kill it. You can probably find used copies of the old CD with the original mix for cheap. Get both.Then get Mighty High...In Drug City.
4,Great Album - Dreadful Recording,"This is great album from top to bottom. Gimme Danger , Search And Destroy , Hard To Beat are all top notch. Penetration has got a great feel to it with the keys in the background. To me the albums strongest song is I Need Somebody , a bluesy kinda thing . Everytime I hear the Stooges name mentioned or I read a review of one of thier albums ,the comparison to the punk bands of mid 70s - early 80s comes up. I couldnt disagree more . The stooges are talented. Thier songs are well crafted and interesting... and Ron Asheton is great guitar player and doesntget nearly the credit he deserves .Dont confuse The Stooges with the three chord wonder bands whocall themselves punk. These guys can flat out play. The onlynegative on this album is that the recording is so bad itsunlistenable. Not even a good remastering could save this . Butthis is still a very, very good album."
5,"Greatest rock record ever, the remix kills the original","I'll make this short and sweet: This is THE best rock record ever put out, it's not history, it is a living breathing rock masterpiece by which all others pale in comparison. This mix brings it all together, you can hear the bass, you can hear the rhythm guitar, this mix put the balls back in the record that was lost in Bowie's mix. Forget about the negative reviews of this remix, they obviously don't get it, they'd probably rather listen to Lawrence Welk or something. You NEED this CD, it will blow you away and give you a reference point for comparison for all rock music. If you've never heard this before you will never listen to music the same after you hear this."
3,WTF Express???,The original mix is the one I prefer. This is too much like rewriting history as far as I'm concerned. I don't think RAW POWER was ever issued to cd properly in the first place. I seem to remember that Sony edited out Ig's beltch on the previous and only other reissue that I know of. Whose idea was that? Someone said to get the original vinyl and I'd have to agree with that assesment if you have a turntable. What they should have done here was issue this as a double cd with Iggy's mix for those who want to hear it along with the unrevised original Bowie mix.
3,This still isn't the original,"This is better than the original issue, but still very tame and bubble-gummy compared to the true original recordings.I know that sounds like a Comic Book Guy claim, but you have to hear the original to understand.The true original recordings were issued as ""Rough Power"" several years ago (Bomp records, I believe) and only if you hear THAT disc will you understand why studio execs were frightened enough to get Bowie (who I consider the best pop musician of the '70s) to tone it down.Rough Power remains one of the few albums of the era that's still fresh, unique, and worth listening to. Hunt it down if you can."
1,Is this one of the worst sounding cds ever? Yes,"Just listen to some previews and get ready to turn your speakers off. It's a shame this album was remastered this bad, and people keep buying it because they think a remaster has to be good. It's a shame, because this is Iggy's best album."
5,Probably Iggy's best stuff,"While this is not only some of Iggy's best work, this is (in my opinion) one of the greatest albums ever. Search and Destroy is a great album opener and the album either stays consistently good if not better as it goes on. Songs like Gimme Danger and Raw Power are songs that should be viewed as classics but are sadly over looked. While this album might be an acquired taste to some, it is a taste worth acquiring and this is a great album in every sense. A classic a five star album and above all a must listen."
5,oh yeah,"Ahh the stooges. I'd have to say that this cd epitomizes the energy that is Iggy Pop. While Fun House is a definite rival, Raw Power takes the cake; serving listeners with the most scrumptuous ear-pudding they'll ever experience. Never heard the Bowie-version of this cd...personally i don't give a poop. How can this cd be topped off? It's the rawest, the most powerful, the wildest it's gonna get. And for that i love it."
3,"Some really good tracks, liked earlier Stooges better","I bought this on a whim. I had read in my ""1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die"" book that this was good and I was looking for some music that had more of an edge than to what I was normally listening too. When I put it into the CD player I was shocked at how dirty the recordings sounded. I'm a huge progressive rock fan and was used to very clean and polished music and was not used to this. After my intial shock, I found that I loved the tracks ""Search and Destroy,"" ""Gimme Danger,"" ""Penetration,"" and ""I Need Somebody."" They're such great tracks. Unfortunatly, rest of the tracks aren't as good, but are not bad, and so I rated this album lower than the other Stooges albums. If you like this, then I recommend Fun House and, if you feel brave, the rare live albums, like Metallic KO (which I just purchased)."
5,the punk holy grail,"i recently tracked down the original ""bowie mix"" and its terrible ,sounds like it was played through a trashcan with a mic at the end ,iggys mix is the best ive heard ,its tough as hell and its too bad it wasnt released this way in '73 ,then maybe we wouldnt have all of these sissy ass bands trying to make garage rock that all seem to come from new york and australia (you know who you are),but i do get what the ""purists"" say about this album ,how it wasnt really the stooges and everything ,and that ""FUNHOUSE"" is the better album of the stooges trilogy,even though this isnt the best stooges album it blows all of this new sh*t away ."
3,"Repackaged from the ""Raw Power"" era","You can tell by the cover art and song list that this is not the original ""Raw Power"" albumn. In fact, all of this has been released before on cds like ""Rough Power"", ""Rubber Legs"", and ""Head On"", ie, alternate versions and demos recorded at the famous ""Detroit Rehearsals"". For me, the pleasure of finding something like this to collect still outweighs being annoyed at having to buy it, but for you it depends on how much you already have, and how much you want. The music of course is 5 stars, but i gave it 3 as a warning."
3,what happened?,"It's doubtful there were any women on the remastering crew. That's our loss -- they might have tempered Iggy's over-amped testosterone level. I can't listen to it at more than 2 or 3 volume (not what Iggy intended, I'm sure). But the most painful thing - more painful than the distortion - is the finality of the ruination of a masterpiece. This is it folks. A great opportunity was lost."
1,"jimmy, jimmy & the leaking log cabin",why get mutt lange to digitally enhance gregorian monk chants? when he first started wailing in a dearborn trailer park i'll bet osterburg thought there would never come a day when he would tour with a man called ben laden in a town called belfast. you cannot fix what's not broken.
3,Bowie Mix Sucks!,"Well, not really. But I prefer the Iggy Pop mix (i.e. the reissue before this reissue). Iggy's version is much ""Raw""-er, bringing the fantastic guitar work to the forefront where it belongs. They should have made an ultra-deluxe version with both mixes and the live stuff - I'd buy that. Although, this might be worth the money just for the live disc. I get tried of stuff I've owned for ten years being reissued. Why not find a band that sounds as good as the Stooges (not a carbon copy, by any means) and release new music for a change? Speaking of which, if you dig the Stooges you should check out Awesome Color - the exception to reissues and bad music."
3,Why the Hype?,"I heard ""I Need Somebody"" and gave this a try. I don't dig the ""in the red"" sound they were going for. To be honest, I don't like most of the songs either. We can all appreciate their influence on what we jam too now, but I just couldn't get into this one. Much respect, no rotation."
5,Actually 57 stars,This is the greatest rock n roll album ever made. Period. If you don't own this you don't own anything.
4,Not as Raw as before,"The Stooges have Iggy singing, and Scott Asheton on drums (although he's not lively here-basically he comes off as a session drummer, while he really stood apart from the band before). Ron Asheton moves to bass (and does a fine job), replacing the underrated Dave Alexander. The new guy on guitar (James Williamson) is good...but it just doesn't sound like the Stooges-although the song compositions are in the same vein (if more complex). The production is wierd-a little murky. ""Iggy does Alice Cooper"" almost!"
3,Pretty cooked,"One of those important releases that just isn't very important to me. Besides the abomination of a remastery, I was just never a fan of Iggy's antics, and in general the songwriting was garage-sheik at best, preferring the gnarling distortion of repetition above all else. There is just enough approach however, to make a good half of the tiny album intriguingly primal enough not to wave it past."
5,Excellent Remaster by Iggy!,"This is such a classic album, and just about every music fan can agree on that. The only concern from fans was: Is the remaster version going to be a complete disaster like Raw Power originally was on CD? The answer is no. Iggy made sure that this version would be clean, smooth, and most of all enjoyable to the listeners' ears. He completed his mission. The CD is great and it seems like I'm seeing The Stooges live in concert. The sound is clean, clear, and crisp. For those of you that still do not own Raw Power, let me give you some suggestions. First of all,the everlasting classic ""Search & Destroy"", ""Gimme Danger"", ""Shake Appeal"", and ""Your Pretty Face is Going To Hell."" (It's very hard for me to pick favorites of Raw Power!)"
3,[This Space Intentionally Left Blank],"I've owned this since 1976 and found it difficult then and now to listen too in its entirety. Recording quality is splattered in 360 directions. It certainly has its moments. Gimme Danger-incredible and can't be without while Doojiman is nonsense and much like Mott the Hooples' ""The Wheel of the Quivering Meat Conception""Part way through listening to this I was politely asked to put on my head phones.You may want to do the same to protect your family and neighbor's mental sanity.Not for the trepid."
4,Very Pleasant Surprise,"I have been trying out various free books on my Kindle, and have been reading a lot of Pre-WWII popular fiction just to see what was popular then. I have landed on some clunkers, but this book is very well written, in a style not unlike A. J. Cronin. Definitely worth trying."
4,"Great Rack, Great Company","The ""Rack"" is perfect to fit all sizes of boards, is made very-well, and is easy to install. Not to mention when I had an issue, Cor-Surf has ""AWESOME"" customer service!!! The only thing I wish was available for this rack is a range of colors or an un-stained model that I could stain and seal myself to match the woodwork in my house."
2,Surfboard Wall Rack,"This product served its purpose, hung my old board on it. I was however, disappointed because some of the pieces on the wood were chipped and scratched, largely in part due to the packaging (which was terrible). This was very noticable because the chipped and scratched parts were white and stood out against the brown varnish.Won't be ordering from this company again, they had to have seen these damages before they shipped it out."
5,Great Customer Service,"The rack arrived in a very timely manner and was exactly as I expected. Through fault of my own, I cracked one of the arms, apparently if you screw the back into the arm too tightly it will stress the wood and can crack it. I called the store directly and the owner was so kind he sent me out another rack immediately. I now have my beautiful 8 foot surf board mounted on the wall and couldn't be happier with the look."
5,Absolutely fabulous,Doreen Yen Hung Feng is the master (or mistress?) of simplicity. She takes complicated (or what I thought was complicated) recipes and makes it easy for a first timer like me to cook up a perfect and very tasty Chinese meal. I was a fan of take-out until I received this book. I was able to find the ingredients in our local grocery store and then follow the simple step by step instructions. I love the pictures and the history and background of the different festivals.
5,Excellent jumping off place for anyone,"I read this in the l970's BEFORE I had my dramatic opening in l979 predicting Skylab coming to earth in Australia.I have been a pro reader for more than 30 years now. JoAnne's down to earth, natural, comfortable system gave me wonderfulbasics to understand the essence of psychic work. I eventually trained for 9 months at Heartsong in California, and now havemy own school...The Natural Psychic School of Metaphysics. I teach a course called the Lightworker Intensive that helps folksgo from ""zero to 60"" in a weekend....but this book will be a wonderful foundation for anyone interested in opening up tospiritual input for happiness and wellbeing. [...]"
1,Absolute Junk,"The discs that I got were unbalanced and made my CD/DVD drive sound like it was tearing itself apart. Didn't bother returning them....just tossed them in the dumpster, where they belong!"
3,Almost a great product...,"The sample Memorex printable CD-R that came with the Epson 900 printer worked great but then I bought the 30-pack -- only to find out that Memorex brands each disk around the center with the Memorex logo and the text ""PRINTABLE CD-R 700MB 48x"". For me that completely defeats the purpose! -- I want it too look like it came from a CD print house, not some hacker's basement. The branding totally stands out too, black on a white background that could easily not jive with your artwork. I was really disappointed. Other than that the printable CD-R technology is really great."
5,Copy without error and print perfect on CD,"Impressed me with this item, i was able to copy anything on it without jammed or error. I was also able to print on it without any smear."
2,The series is OK at best IMO,"I have read all three in the series and it was a long drawn out struggle to finish. Poyer displays his great knowledge of events, sailing, and personal drama. If you are not a nut for detailed sailing and weak drama, then you may not like this book and series, because action is lacking. I have also read James Nelson Civil War Naval books and enjoyed them. This series is boring at times and had me flipping pages until something interesting occurs - it could be alot of pages.This is civil war naval stuff - a war that is not known for much naval action, except for a handful of events. As you can guess, our heroes hit all the main events, that is one event per book. The first is Sumter, then Raiders, and finally Hampton Roads.The series appears to have stopped. Likely because it is hard to keep anything interesting going. The only thing left to cover is river battles. At the used prices, I got what I paid for and an OK read."
5,More Information About Whistles Across the Land from The Antiquarian Resource,"Book title is ""Whistles Across the Land: A love affair with trains."" Since I am the first to review this book I am here to offer more information for the buyer to use in consideration of their purchase. I love trains myself and have perused the book. I am a book seller and I happen to be selling a copy of it here at Amazon.com.It was written by Richard Steinheimer with the extensive number of photographs by the author and by Shirley Burman, with additional quotations by Lucius Beebe, William Cowper & Francis Bacon. It was published by Cedco Pub. Co., 1993. Size is a 12"" by 10."" Book is 96 pages of color illustrations with writings. From the insert:""Whistles across the land beautifully chronicles in photos and text the profound changes that have affected American railroading over the past half century....""Nice train photographs, most all from the 20th century."
5,Just As Promised,The product arrived as described and in the promised time frame. I was very pleased and would buy again from this vendor.
5,My favorite scent!,"I've been wearing this fragrance for over 7 years now and often receive compliments. I would describe it as a light, clean scent!"
5,The Most Useful Academic Kanji Dictionary I Have Used,"This is the original kanji dictionary a lot of us who lived in Japan in the late 80s and early 90s used. I've compared it to other Japanese-English Kanji dictionaries, and I still think this one is the most useable (even better than its newer revision). The system for finding radicals and then locating the target kanji works well, and the more often I use it, the more the system becomes intuitive. I've used it for paid translation work when translation engineering documents, for translating martial arts texts, and for composing letters to my Japanese friends. Only rarely do I find that the target kanji is not included. This dictionary rocks!"
1,"These are ""Light duty"" gloves","I bought a couple of pairs of these gloves but I had to return one pair because the one I used ripped and began to wear out after one use. They're marked ""Light Duty"" on the box so i guess I'll look for the heavy duty ones."
4,Fits Like A Glove,"I bought these for shooting sporting clays and haven't worn them for that yet, but have handled my shotgun in these gloves, and everything seemed to go well. I've lit a BIC, poked out a message on a laptop keyboard, and can use the icons on my phone, but typing (touchscreen) isn't happening for me.I used the size chart you can print at the Mechanix site and it's absolutely perfect on my hand, but my index finger to thumb area feels pretty tight with my hand open."
2,Not the same,The mechanix utility gloves use a thinner fabric than the original gloves. When I tried then on for the first time I grabbed the velcro strap to put the gloved on and the strap tore off. These gloves are not worth the cost. Just get the original gloves and pass on these.
5,Perfect for shooting gloves,I bought these to use while I handle/shoot my guns. They are very comfortable. You still get a good Feel of what you're touching with these gloves on. Best deal I could find anywhere.
3,gloves,"Gloves are fine, except maybey it was my mistake or maybe I didn't noticed it, but the gloves were to small for me"
2,New style???,"I have small hands and the small utility gloves where perfect for a tight fit, but Mechanix changed the look and fit of their gloves and the fingers are too long and the gloves are not as tight. I returned them thinking there had been a mistake, but the replacement gloves were the same. Too bad they changed my favorite gloves."
2,"Really thin, not much protection for the price.","I thought I'd try a pair and of course pay a premium for them. But they don't really live up to what I need, just too thin. They don't offer much protection and are too light to use in cold weather where you might want some type of glove but need the dexterity too, which is the main reason I bought them.Anyway probably work well for most people but not for me, other brands do better for less money."
4,"Well written and convinving book, but I disagree with liberation theology","This book uses great examples as evidence of liberation theology. The author chooses his words carefully and makes strong connections. After I finished this book I felt like I really understood what the theology is, why it's necessary to practice, and how to talk about it. Many books don't leave me feeling as educated as this book does.However, having a degree in theology and studying it on my own, I do not agree that liberation theology should exist. This book allowed me to really think through my stance, but I feel that the concept of liberation theology assumes too much about God's will and doesn't acknowledge the difference between human will and God's will."
4,Great Overview,"If you're interested in starting down the road of understanding Liberation Theology, this is a great springboard. You will definitely understand the history, mission, and movement of Liberation Theology, but you will also receive enough information to point you in the direction of furthering your knowledge, if that is what you desire."
2,No audiophile will like this one,"I am not an audiophile, but when I saw this for 68c plus shipping I sprung for it.It's now selling for 3c plus shipping, but still not worth the $3.01 total price.The orchestra seems to be playing well, but the sound is all tubby mid-range, no distinct voices, the tempi rather slow.Unexciting, uninteresting, unvivid. A waste of time. I did not listen to the whole symphony.The piano works were better recorded. I do not know these works otherwise and have no strong reaction to them or this interpretation.I listened in SACD but 2-channel only."
5,Good B12,Excellent B12- Easily dissolves and has a pleasant taste too. Does not leave an after taste in mouth or a chocky film. I recommend this to any other b12.
5,True Character Study - Awesome character,"If nothing else can be said for Warren Lehrer you can say that he is excellent at capturing people. I love this book. I've read all the portrait series books (I had to for class) and Claude was my second favorite. Brother Blue was my first. Claude is a captivating guy. I can see why women love him. If you're looking for a book that truly reveals and captures an honestly interesting character, buy this book. Heck, it's worth it just to read Claude's advice for having great relationships."
2,Easy Microsoft Windows 2000 Profesional,"I purchased this book after upgrading my computer from Windows 98 to Windows 2000 Professional. I thought it would help me learn the diffrences between the two systems so I could easily maximize the advantages of Windows 2000. Even though I am not a computer expert in any way, the book is so elementary that anyone who has used Windows 98 already knows just about everything presented, i.e. ""How to turn your computer on"" etc.Probably a good book for someone who has never used Windows (of any sort)."
4,Fine but weird,"It's a very intimate CD,and a listener should thank on his knees that by buying this little album hes admitted to the closely bound-up circle of insiders :). Basically, all songs when Adriana sings and plays the guitar background are really heavenly tunes,and there's really a tangible kind of affinity between her and the audience.But what baffled me, was that apart from the majority, there's: a) a couple of tracks which don't belong to the performance ao livo; b) i don't like people fiddling with the recorded live material (like in the ending of ""Cariocas"")The CD is great for its acoustic songs (a must-have!) and very weird coz of all those things added to the input performance. But even if it spoils all the fun, the CD is still worth coughing up a few bucks :)"
5,An inspirations of brazilian sound,"For those who love great brazilian music, here is an album you must not pass by without try. You will found some of the most beautyfull and passionate Adriana's songs in her dazzling voice. Try it. Ps- The cover showed here are not the one of ""Publico"",it belongs to ""Maritimo"" another album of these brazilian singer."
2,better work on the subject is awaited.,"well i am dissapointed with the book.in 49 pages the years at aden,trading days and the groups emergence in top 50 indian companies is completed . ambanis noncooperation has truly taken the life out of the book.he remains an enigma to many.doesnt justify the epic proportions of the great businessman.no light is shed on the man behind the legend. research prertains to newspaper clippings only.in just four pages the author transforms a trader into the top 50 indian businesshouses.the high price of the book is ridiculous."
3,A stark reality into Indian business,"The book describes how business is conducted in India. While things have improved a bit since dismantling of license raj, behind the scenes rampant corruption still exists. While Ambani followed the other businessman of his day, one needs to give him credit to think and execute big and create entire markets in the process. While his son Mukesh has been performing well, the same cannot be bet on his other son Anil in the long run. I have some international prints of this book that I will be glad to sell."
3,"Good, but not their best.","This is the first Connells album I heard. I was introduced by the smallish hit Stone Cold Yesterday. But this isn't their best work. Most will admit that most Connells stuff sounds roughly the same and that certainly applies here. But if you only plan to buy one or two of their CD's, get Boyland Heights and Fun N Games first."
4,good guitar pop,this was the first album i heard from the connells i liked it from the first song. they are a genuine band with great songs
3,Not Their Best,"It's too bad that Amazon has clips of every single song on this album, but has NO song clips available for their other, better albums such as Boylan Heights. This album is OK, but that's it, just OK. It's a few notches down from previous works. Oh well, at least you can listen to the clips and decide for yourself."
5,A Wonderful CD,"After nearly wearing out my cassette tape of this album, it is time to get it on CD. I have listened to this album over and over and still love every song on it. It's too bad the Connells never had a wider audience."
1,rope stuck/ bad quality,"i have a large husky 65b , and I bought the large one, I got it for 3 days only and the rope is stuck, don't get it so bad buying this one its like throwing your money on the street>"
4,Great product..however...,"Beware, that you might not get the color, in picture (currently, it is red)..anyway, as you can see none is indicated. I had gotten a hardness (red) to go with the product. Imagine my surprised when I got blue. Anyway, two phone calls to Amazon and I had gotten two day shipping and the difference for the hardness to go with, I decided to kept the blue leash but I am returning the red hardness (getting a refund as well), they are picking it up by UPS, courteously fulfilled by Amazon. Hopefully, Amazon will fix this issue soon with either having the color choices displayed or just simply stating--""you will get any color we choose to give you, that's currently available"". Anyway, I gave it 4 stars for the headache but 5 stars on the product itself and 5 stars on customer service; in relation to the second phone call."

5,Great Bodom Album,Children of Bodom does it again with their new album Hate Crew Deathroll. The overall mood of the music has changed and takes a turn being much more heavy and faster than the previous albums.. It is a great improvement that makes this album superiour to the ones that came before it. The growling is now a thing of the past... the vocalist/guitarest (alexi Laiho) seems to be using a different type of vocalization now... more yelling and screaming early slayer type stuff.. Very good album and DEFINETLY worth buying if your a cob fan or just getting into them... either way you cannot go wrong with HATE CREW DEATHROLL!
5,HELL YES!!!,"This is Children of Bodom's best album and one of my favorite death metal albums to come out recently! Children of Bodom have grew into one of my favorite bands actually and are second to only Opeth in the Scandinavian death metal scene which is full of incredible bands like Opeth, In Flames, Meshuggah, At the Gates, and Children of Bodom. Alexi Laiho is a pretty good vocalist but what he's superb at is his guitar work which is mind-blowing! The solo in ""Sixpounder"" is seriously one of the best solos I ever heard in my life! That's not it though, there are also keyboard solos by the incredible Janne Wirman!So yeah this is a superb album and is Children of Bodom's best work to date! I wasn't a big fan of ""Hatebreeder"" and ""Follow the Reaper"" but this and their other two albums are awesome!"
5,Love it!,"This is an awesome set of songs and recommend this to anyone that likes metal. Some people get turned off by the vocals of death metal and other genres that have the 'growl' sound, but listen to me, It'll grow on you.My favorite songs on this album are needled 24/7, sixpounder, and my absolute favorite is angels don't kill."
4,Good Album,"This is yet another album from Children of Bodom that hits its stride almost half-way through. There are 9 tracks on the album,and everyone of them are COB quality. Fast and hard is the style they go for, and this album is no exception. However, I find Blooddrunk to be much more of an enjoyable album and the songs are discernable in that one. All-in-all, good album but not their best."
4,Not the best COB album...,"This album has a great start, and the trashy ""Sixpounder"" really kicks you off the chair, but while the first listen can make you easily shout a ""what the...!!"" going further you will miss the old classical riffs and the amazing keyboards leads that make Hatebreeder a masterpiece. Hate Crew Deathroll is surely worth buying, but for the newbies it's better starting from that...The Slayer cover is bizarre... just try to think about King playing some keyboards... ;-)Highlights: Sixpounder, Bodom Beach Terror, Angels Don't Kill"
5,INSANE CD,"This was my first COB cd and i love it! It's insane from start to finish. Real heavy and real crazy. If you liek real heavy metal on the darker side, then buy this cd!"
5,This is an awesome cd,"This cd is so amazing, i cant explain it. Follow the reaper was my first cd(also incredible). This one isn't as extreme though, but its still amazing. Highly recomended."
4,"Good Bodom disc, but not the best so far.","Still a solid release from this band, Hate Crew Deathroll is the last full album Children of Bodom have produced since their masterpiece ""Follow The Reaper"". The vocals are just as hard and aggressive as those on their previous release, but the songs sound a bit more similar on this CD. This is the only reason I give it four stars, instead of five. The songs ""Needled 24/7"", ""Bodom Beach Terror"" and ""You're Better off Dead"" are all stand out tracks. None rival COB's best song ""Everytime I Die"", from their previous album. This is, nevertheless, a solid offering. It is recommended for any fan of melodic death metal or black metal. The vocals are just as good as those in ""Follow the Reaper"", if not better, but the general emotional intensity of the songs is not as present as it was in ""Follow the Reaper""."
4,Bodom does it again!,"Hails to these finnish dudes!Again another awesome release by truly one of the best finnish bands out there....and finland spawns plenty.I would say this album is more brutal then follow the reaper, Keys are less dominant and the drumming is more noticable.Songs are still catchy as ever... but some lack the classical guitar/keys battles that is found in earlier bodom.Standout tracks are Needled 24-7,Sixpounder,Lil' Bloodred Ridin'Hood,Bodom Beach Terror,Hate Crew Deathroll.Would have given it 5 stars but again the lack of technical guitar work compared to earlier work brings the score down.still a very kick ... album"
3,kind of a let down,"well i cant say this is the worst cd i have heard, and i cant say its the best. what i can say is its kind of a let down. i was expecting the catchyness of most of their other work. somebody put something in my drink i think is probably the worst bodom song i have heard in a while. some songs are good. your better off dead is one of my more favorite bodom songs. but the cd kind of just lacks something..."
2,Short review :D,"From a TexanIn short these guys used to be... well... like metal gods to me. THEY ROCKED!!! But sadly Children Of Bodom (this is the part where you cringe from the reviewer's discust) grew old to me within like 2 years, sadly. So although they are pretty great, soon they will turn stale, kinda like what nu metal does. But still this review shoundn't turn you away from this album if your like... not a very old metalhead, like lets say if your less than a few years old to metal you'll probably love Children Of Bodom to say they are like THE GREATEST!!! So yea, if you like the thought of a metal band having melodic influences in it, then you'll love this band (oh yea, some girls I know love this band also cause of Alexi Laiho's hotness haha). The older metalhead dudes might ummm wanna go the other way n check out Negura Bunget, Drudkh, Agalloch,Orphaned Land,Isis,Krisiun, and Vader. Peace y'all."
2,"Amazing Guitaring, Lousy Vocals",Alexi Laiho is a guitar virtuoso. He is simply of the greatest metal guitarists out there. But his vocals are simply crap. I borrowed HTD yesterday and was floored by the riffs and the solos. But the vocals were a major turnoff. I recommend this to those kids who just need a reason to praise any kind of death/black/doom metal just because it sounds different than regular heavy metal.Highlight: Alexi Laiho's guitar work.
3,marketing ploy,"This doesn't work as well as the regular Crest Vivid White toothpaste does. In fact, I don't see any difference with it. Best to go with the original stuff instead."
3,3 different DVDs for this...,"...obviously 2 of them are bootlegs. Kinda like playing a shell game, ain't it? Hell, maybe they're all bootlegs! Getting harder and harder every day to tell what's legit or not here on Amzon."
5,Brigitte Nielson rules!!!!,The beautiful Brigitte Nielson rules in this steamy romance.It's a must See!!!!!!!!!!!!1
1,bye bye baby,This dvd had the worst video quality I have ever seen.I am not certain but I think it may have been a poorly done bootleg.
2,iffy,"I am a big fan of super nintendo games however, this game does not really matchup the graphics are iffy at best, and the game play is Terrible"
3,Not a bad all temperature wax but I have used better,"I had heard about Hertel ""Super Hot Sauce"" and thought I would give it a try. it is just okay. I prefer Demon all temperature wax, cheaper and works better in all conditions."
2,"Remakes, 2 of Them are Better","All of these are badly remade by some random, unknown, and talentless person with the acception of ""Beautiful Stranger"" and ""Where my Girls At?"" which actually sound better than the original. Don't buy this but download those 2 tracks from Amazon."
3,What can I say about this,Twisted Sister is an acquired taste - I get it. A couple of these are really good - the rest - not so much. but I'm still a fan!
5,Twisted Christmas,"I LOVE this CD. The Twelve Days of Christmas song is GREAT! Hysterical! If there is any one band that can put a heavy metal ""twist"" to Christmas music, it's Twisted Sister! ""Twist"" on!"
1,Why make a christmas album!!!,"This album sucks. I was so dissapointed when it turned out to be a christmas album. A metal christmas is right up my ally but i wanted a new studio album from TS with new meteral not a lame christmas album. Hopefully they will make a new ""real"" album, they need to after this, they can't end their metal legacy with this tripe.Please TS make another studio album!"
5,Very Cool and a lot of fun!,"This album is so much fun. Twister Sister takes classic Christmas carols and gives them their heavy metal spin. Some people may argue that they shouldn't mess with these holiday standards, but believe it or not they are still respectful to the original songs. My sons and I had a blast listening to this album together!"
5,Surprisingly good,"I'm a great lover of all kinds of Christmas music, but I was light on heavy-metal Christmas music. Obviously. I took a chance on this CD and it didn't disappoint. While Twisted Sister doing Christmas sounds gimmicky, surprisingly it works. Most of the songs are earnest renditions of the classics while remaining true to the spirit of metal. I appreciated in particular that Oh Come All Ye Faithful - with more than a wink to We're Got Gonna Take It - was respectful of the religous content of the original. Sister probably never received true credit for their talent; this album suggests to me that they had plenty of it to spare."
5,Another Classic Christmas,"I was first skeptical when I saw their page on myspace, but after hearing O come oh ye faithful I was hooked. totally rockin christmas albumn sure to be a classic throughout the years. Love this CD and would reccommend it to someone who is looking for a not so traditional albumn to rock out on the holidays.."
3,Good collectable,Eventually maybe when you are around 75 or 80 you may stop playing this at Christmas.It is a good change from top 40 artist Christmas albums.Good head banging and rocking sing along.
4,Twisted Sister does Christmas!,"This is a pretty good CD. I probably wouldn't have bought it if the reviews from the local classic rock station weren't so high. I wouldn't give it a 5 but if you like TS, this works."
1,Sorry .. used to love it,"After Dee came out and got political, i lost my taste for this one. Musicians, leave politics out of your careers and just entertain us. If you're still a Dee Snider fan, you'll love this like i used to."
3,What is this crap?,"It's a Christmas album by Twisted Sister, of all things. It features heavy metal versions of traditional Christmas songs. It's actually kind of entertaining, in a dopey kind of way, although some of the songs run too long. The CD features an unlisted 11th track, which is a very brief sing-along of ""We Wish You a Twisted Christmas""."
1,Not Impressed,"I love Twsited Sister, the raw pure hard rock, anti-social lyrics and general fun. I was wrapped to see a new release, seeing it was call Twisted Chistmas, i thought it would mock a few of the songs in a typical anti-social Twisted way... wrong.. very wrong, its very Chistmas indeed.Now i cant sy i enjoy Christmas music at all, even on Christmas day!! But i cant imagine driving around in mid March playing Chistmas carols! so whats the point? Maybe 2 or three max Chistmas carols and some cool Twisted originals, not all these carols!!! Horrible.In a nutshelll , if your a Christmas Junkie this will be fantastic for you, if you aint, your gonna have a chuckle and say what the ... and never play it again , maybe once a year to bring the joy or something.Twisted Sister.. PLEASE do a new Album with your own material! i dread to think whats next?A Twisted Easter, Happy New Sister,Cmon get real."
4,A needed analysis of the Churchs of the East,"A fascinating look at the Churches of the East, and how they not only differ from the churches of the West, but also from one another. It may be labelled ""An Introduction"", but I found plenty of new information, and detailed analyses, all presented in a readable manner. And this book should hopefully go some way to fixing the lack of general knowledge of the Eastern Churches."
5,Willaim Kent Krueger,This is one of his better ones but they are all great. I just wish there where more authors that pick story lines like Krueger does. I live in Montana and relate to his writing through camping and trial hiking in the mountains and lakes. Nature has so much more life and substance.
3,As Good as Wm Ken Krueger Gets,"I liked the book, but then I like anything this man has written. I'd give it a ""7"" overall."
1,a soap opera in the woods,this is the second novel by this author I have read or tried to read/the author is clearly captivated by his own characters and forgotten what a good thriller is supposed to do
4,They'll get the job done,"Of the 150+ DVDs I've burned, I've had problems with roughly 5 of them due to actual problems with these DVDs. I do burn at a slower speed to keep the errors to a minimum - sometimes patience really does pay off. Since I'm just using these to backup DVDs, speed isn't necessarily an issue for me. The price is fair, and I will continue to buy them (do keep an eye on the 25, 50 and 100 pack spindles before actually purchasing, sometimes it is cheaper to buy 2 25 packs instead of the 50 pack spindles)."
1,WARNING,"I had no problems burning to these discs, its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore. After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them, my discs started dying after a few months.In addition, in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become. This is true for all the discs (about 150 of them). I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Memorex DVD+R failure rate,This order of DVD's had higher than normal failure rates.The Sony DVD read/writer was unable to write to about 10% of these DVD's. This is too high and makes the price per DVD high. Reliability of backups is very important to us.I have been using Memorex for a long time. Next time I will try another brand.
2,CMC disks are crap,"I would avoid these discs. I have been using these discs for some time doing backups. Recently, I've had a few problems and decided to look at these further. I noticed another review that said that the discs are made by multiple companies under the Memorex brand as are others like TDK, etc.. I used to DVD info and noticed that my most recent purchase is made by CMC and I'm having problems with some of the discs including burn errors. One disk has strange ring in the die. I have the NEC 1300a burner. I also having some trouble playing backups on the same drive on my computer. Less trouble playing on my Sony DVD player. Just based on this (not a clear indication of what you're getting when you purchase), I would go with something else. These discs are not cheap enough for this reason."
1,LOW QUALITY Disks - These are CMC Magnetics F01,"As nomorecoasters mentioned, these are pathetic garbage landfill materials. I originally bought a stack of 50 of these Memorex 4x DVD+Rs, they all burned fine. I heard from forums that CMC disks suck. As a non-believer, I bought another stack. This time, I hit the jackpot. Out of 10 disks, 4 disks have data verification failures on them. Every one of these disks would have funny looking rings on the written side due to uneven dyes. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,Beware NEC 1100A Owners!!,"I had backed up many DVDs on Memorex dvd+r at 4X, so this time i went for the 50pack. The problem is that these new discs will only burn at 2.4X, probably they changed the id coding in the dvds and the last firmware upgrade for the NEC 1100A doesn't support 4X writing on these brand. Now i'm stuck with a 50pack spindle that only burns at a slow 2.4X(about 40 min per DVD). So before you buy i'd suggest you buy a pair of individual DVD's just to make sure they will work on your burner. I'll guess i'll try the HP DVD+R 4X that are priced very similar. And also NEC won't do any more firmware upgrades on the 1100A. The newest version is 10GE and it does not support these. It was released may 2003."
1,My Optorite drive will not recognize them...,"I bought a 25 pack of these. My Optorite drive has detected and written over a dozen other brands of +R discs. These are the ONLY discs that it wont recognize. I even upgraded the firmware on my drive.Oddly, I just finished up a 25 pack that I got about a year ago. Going to dvdhelp, you can see that there are several different manufacturers of Memorex disks. I dont know who made these... I cant even read them.... but they dont work and I would not recommend them."
1,"Incredibly inconsistent, and a waste for me.","Out of the past 20 burns, I have only had 10 DVD's burn successfully. I use Roxio CD Creator version 7, which does a great job with my CD's, so I'm pretty sure it's the DVD media. Not only am I wasting all my money, but my time as well. I've tried to lower the burn speed, but it does not matter. I'd try something else."
1,Buy the 25 pack for CHEAPER!!!,"If you go to the link above for the dvd+r memorex 25 pack spindle, they only cost $29. Therefore, if you buy two 25 packs, you'll get 50 dvd+r disks for about $60 while you'll have to pay $69 for the actual 50 pack. (Also, both are applicable for the supersaver shipping).Hope that helps some people. Good Luck with your burnin'"
5,A Nice Overview of Education Reform,"This book provides a nice overview of several educational reform movements. The writing style is good enough that it doesn't drag too much. Sometimes, the author is too opinionated (this only occurs about 2x in the whole book). Otherwise, this is a decent, informative read."
4,"Good, but needs to be updated.",The dance music industry changes so quickly as to make this book dated within a year or so from publication.
2,not as advertised,"I agree with a previous reviewer, and wasn't happy when this came covered in blue paint. My biggest issue though was the 'made in Taiwan' sticker on it. Vaughan advertises made in America, with huge 'Made in USA' logos on their website. its disappointing to see another product outsourced and to know that money I thought I was spending on American jobs instead gets shipped overseas."
3,My God! I am Blind! I cannot see Microscopic type.,"I ordered this Book after having bought the ""Fogels"" book, This book does have somewhat more info on precise issues than Fogels but, to my dismay the print is so tiny that using the book is rather difficult. ( Holding a Magnifying Glass, the Book and doing the back and forth balancing act.) I would say that this book would have been a lot nicer in a larger format. Also I would say that in order to get a good Idea of what you need in information, The Fogels Book and the Kennedy Book are needed. Information is good but it drove me up a tree with the tiny print, The books size was/is approximately 5"" X 7"", I have never seen the size of the book mentioned in listings. Good Luck 1 Thumb up and 1 thumb down."
3,"Fluffy, but fun","This one is the modern, fully developed Connie Willis, firing her wit at your boots to keep you dancing. Chaos theory, the origins of fads, Dilbertesque management methods, sheep, and fashion impairment, Alexander Fleming, latte, Winston Churchill, pineapple upside-down cake, this book has it all . . . even though, in many ways, it's more of a very long short story than a novel. Sandra Foster is the fads researcher, Bennett O'Reilly is the chaos-driven sheepherder (sort of), and everything comes out all right in the end. A light, fluffy read -- but lots of fun, with the author's usual great grasp of characterization and some interesting points to make about the nature of scientific discovery."
5,Wonderful speculative fiction,"The more Connie Willis I read, the more I like her work. The tone of this book is strongly reminiscent of ""To say Nothing of the Dog"", so chances are if you liked that one, you'll like this one. Instead of being a time-travel story, however, it is set in contemporary Boulder, Colorado (an ideal environment for any trends researcher such as our main character, I assure you). I really got the feeling while reading this that I was present at a scientific breakthrough. All the disparate events and characters force the story gradually to a satisfying conclusion, while giving the impression that they are stumbling blocks to any progress that might be possible. Just a lovely, lighthearted book -- which may lead you to deep thoughts if you wish, but which can certainly be enjoyed on a more ""surface"" level."
3,Nothing going on,"Willis is a capable writer, which makes it all themore frustrating that there's so little behind this book. The protagonist researches fads at a corporate think-tank. The descriptions of these fads are amusing, as Willis' depiction of corporate mindlessness. But there's not much else to the book--a flimsy plot, likeable but bland characters, and none of the social or technological insight which characterize good science fiction. I got the feeling Willis was capable of much more, given a strong idea to start with."
5,I was hooked from the very first line of this book.,It is so amusing that I would catch myself chuckling aloud as Iread. And as for all the chaos in the book - sounds a lot likewhere I work. And the whims perpetrated by Management? Exactlylike what I'm familiar with!
4,"sheep, chaos, and management collide",As a scientist for a large corporation I found this to be an absolutely hilarious read. If you have ever found yourself confronted with idiot behavior on a scale that leaves you compltely dumbfounded this is the book for you.
3,"One fad too many: chaos, corproate work and humour","I started reading ""Bellwether"" a chapter a day, and that didn't help it. I was able to enjoy it only after I had a whole day to spend with it, and it made me laugh joyously. Its humour needs your attention to enjoy it.Though wholesomely entertaining, I found ""Bellwether"" a little too light-hearted for its own good. The easy laughs and predictable outcomes made it too similar to most entertainment out there. The literary structure was also too obvious, constantly going on about how scientific breaktroughs are made by accident, all kinds of trends and fads we are drowining on, and how the source of rivers don't seem like too much of a thing.All in all, this is light fare, but intelligent. If you're looking for something smart to get you laughing, this a read you won't regret."
3,Infuriating !,"This book has probably the most infuriating character in a recent book. It annoyed me that the rude, disdainful and thoughtless Flip got away with her actions. I was also irritated at Sandra, the prtagonist, for accepting Flip's behavior without giving her a good shake. A couple of times, I almost put the book aside. What kept me reading were the interesting factoids included about fads. Later on, when the sheep took center stage, the book was actually laugh-aloud funny. Glad I managed to persevere."
4,intriguing yet relaxing read,"This is not science fiction as we know it. It explained to me the bellwether phenomenon, which I was not aware of. I think that most of the conclusions in this novel are actually true. It is a very fast read and the story is enclosed in a relatively short form. The book is written from the point of view of a scientist who does research on fads in a big institute (the institute resembles rather a corporation to me, not a scientific environment I am used to, but, after all, the ""science fiction"" tag gives the author some room here). The research, although it seems to go completely wrong at the beginning, is a big success at the end. Sandra, the main protagonist, couples forces (and falls in love; the love story is funny, too) with another scientist, Bennett, who works on chaos theory. The solution of the problem involves some sheep and an incredibly messy mail clerk. Good laugh, entertaining with a twist (it can actually make the reader stop and think for a moment)."
2,Read Pattern Recognition instead,"This is a formulaic love story set in what is supposed to be a research institution. The author has clearly done a lot of reading and found a lot of trivia about fads, and drops short infobites about fads in history into the text throughout. Unfortunately the plot moves slowly, the writing is competant in a breezey way and the researchers don't appear to do any real research. As a researcher myself I was disappointed in the shallow portrayal of science. Apart from the rather unlikely ways in which the main characters conduct their research (going to the public library to find general books on sheep? Sorting newspaper clippings but never having any idea of a theoretical approach?) there are just silly factual mistakes, like when the protagonist is said to have a double major in her PhD.William Gibson's Pattern Recognition is about the same general ideas but is much better written with a more engaging and less clichéed plot."
5,Bellwether is great reading fun,"I like Connie Willis, I read all her books but this one is my way-out-in-front favorite so far. I could not put it down and hoped it would never end. Her humor in this story is imaginative, subtle, ironic and hilarious, never trite, but very tongue in cheek. A real knee slapping, laugh-out-loud kind of book. I had no idea she could be so brilliant. It is a fine commentary on the absurdity of our times. The characters are so real; they reminded me of lots of kinky folks I know. I really loved it."
2,A bureaucratic satire that is...,"...heavy on bureaucracy and light on satire.Take all the plot typically found in a three-panel Dilbert cartoon -- stretch it out to a thin 247 pages -- and you have Bellwether.So despite the fact that I'm fascinated with fads, emergent systems, chaos theory, etc., the book failed to hold my interest.Given the high praise that Connie Willis has received for her other books, I'll assume that this was a rare misfire."
2,Fair,"I read this book for a Book Club and was disappointed because it really is not discussion material. There is one clever idea about society having bellwether individuals which is belabored to death. This book is adequate for it's genre - that being low-brow sci-fi with some slap-stick humor. Other than that it is formulaic and repetitive. Even for summer reading it's a lightweight. I give it two stars because it does have one good idea, and it is a nice example of how to stick tightly to a formula when writing fiction."
4,Science fiction? Or just plain entertaining?,"This book is not for lovers of hard core sci-fi. In fact, it has few elements of traditional sci-fi.What Bellwether does contain is an entertaining plot, given substance by a subtext of chaos theory in action, sympathetic and realistic characters, and satirical humor. Willis takes aim at fads and trends, modern romance, and corporate lifestyles, and she delivers the goods.Douglas Coupland + John Irving x Kurt Vonnegut."
4,Not SF but still an interesting hybrid,"I was well into this book, still waiting for an SF element to kick in, when I finally realized that it wasn't going to happen. What can we call this-- romantic satirical physics fiction? There's a cute little love story, some sharp satire from the world of research science, some nice application of chaos theory and, well, not much else. Ultimately this is fluff, but well written, well informed, and funny fluff."
3,"Fun, funny, lightweight","If you're looking for your first Connie Willis book, read The Doomsday Book, To Say Nothing of the Dog, or Passage first. Any of those three are so much better than this. But, Bellwether is fun, sometimes funny, and a lightweight read. It's short enough to blow through, uncomplicated enough not to require flipping back to be sure you didn't miss anything. Anyone who works in an office will recognize all of the office characters and politics - they're universal sure gags we all love to identify with."
1,Pretty bad,"This dvd had its moments, but only a few. I enjoy camp, and have a good sense of humor, but there was very little humor here. The acting and dialogue were so poor that I couldn't enjoy the camp value that was intended. Sound quality was also very poor; at various points in the movie I couldn't hear what was being said because of the loud background music. Not worth the money by a long shot!"
1,NOT GOOD,"If you're going to do a parody of soap operas, whether or not you make the characters are gay, the first thing you have to do is make it funny. This movie didn't even try. So low-budget that even the DVD was cheaply made, although not cheaply priced. You'd be better off blowing your thirty bucks on scratch-off lottery tickets."
1,Spoof? How stupid can it get?,"Well, there are things that are so bad, they aren't even funny anymore. Satire is a very demnding genre and should only be tackled by very good directors with a great cast. This just doesn't cut it."
1,No changes.,"Just a simple review. I bought a month supply and had been taking for 2 weeks straight and these pills did absolutely nothing for me. For all I know these could have just been sugar pills, because I felt nothing."
3,Keep reading series,"Not the best book in his series, but a delight nevertheless. Truly enjoy reading Smith's work; can't wait 2C what happens next."
5,Continuing a Great series,I have enjoyed all of the Ladies Detective Agency books and this was no exception. Kept my interest and I had trouble putting it down!
3,Charming but Weak,"I expected a tightly written culmination to the other books in this series and was disappointed. The characters maintain their quirks and charm, but the story was ""much ado about nothing."" It seemed to me that Mr. McCall Smith was filling pages merely to fulfill his audience's demand for another installment. The Full Cupboard of Life is not a ""bad"" read, and certainly should be read if you enjoy this ongoing story, but it lacks the poignancy of the others."
4,Enjoyable finale to the series,"Precious Ramotswe is beginning to wonder if her fiance, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, will ever set the date for their wedding. Mr. Matekoni has his own problems, especially the announcement in the newspaper that he is going to make a parachute jump to earn money for the local orphans' home. The announcement has been put in the paper by the woman who runs the orphans' home and who will not take ""no"" for an answer from Mr. Matekoni. He also has two apprentices who are more interested in girls than in fixing cars, and some people in a rival mechanics' business who are cheating their customers. Precious, the owner of the #1 Ladies' Detective Agency, is pursuing a case for a lady who has four suitors to decide among. In her spare time, however, she helps out Mr. Matekoni with his problems and receives some help in encouraging her fiance to the altar. This final installment in the series contains all of the charm which has made these books so popular."
3,Pleasant story - but not a mystery,"I started with this book in the series, and I admit I shouldn't have. There was mystery involved, no detective work, no puzzle to unsolve. It was a book for readers of the series to familiarize with the characters."
2,Not so full. . .,This one not as good as the previous in the series - enjoyed so much more when the focus was on the detective agency - kind of wanders around and too much male bashing
4,Botswana Immersion,"Being transported to Gabarone in Botswana is a strange and unsettling experience, but very welcome. The heroine, her partner, and her fiance are truly honourable and thoughtful people and their adventures and thoughts about their country and their people are riveting. A reviewer's comment ""Miss Marple of Botswana"" is not misguided."
4,"a gentle, evocative read","I read this book (the fifth in a series) somewhat out of sequence, having already read later novels in the series. This meant I already knew the answer to the question posed by Mma Ramotswe at the beginning of the novel. This didn't spoil the enjoyment for me, in fact quite the contrary, as I was quite intrigued to know whether it would be answered in this instalment (and how). I wasn't disappointed.As with the others in the series, I thought the book , with one case for our detective to get her teeth into, whilst allowing us, the readers, to share more of the lives of the characters created by Alexander McCall Smith.[...]"
5,As good as the others,"I always enjoy this series. There is something so warm and homely about it, and the setting is beautifully described."
3,Too much of the same,"If you haven't read the first few, don't read this review. The Ladies Detective series continues to be entertaining, but this one is just a long string of McCall's catch-phrase descriptions. Mma Matkusi got 97%, Mma Ramotswe is a traditionally built woman, Mr JLB Matekoni is a good man, Mma Potokwane is pushy and makes great cake, old Botswana ways are the best.... Not much intrigue or character growth in this one. Just hoping the next one is better."
3,Too repetitious!,"I absolutely adored the first four books in this sessions. This one was disappointing in comparison. My main complaint is that the first fourth of the book recaps what happened in previous books. After a while I began to wonder when the new material would begin! However, once the new material came into the story I was happy as a clam hearing what was happening to my favorite charachters!"
3,Set in Botswana,"The setting and description of life and customs in this part of Africa was for me the best part of the novel. Though I was desperate for something to read on a trans-Atlantic flight, I just did not get into this book quickly or for long periods of time. The narrative was a little disjointed, and the series of ""mysteries"" never required a lot of investigation, so there wasn't a lot of suspense. The one concerning the good/bad doctor was obvious to me straight away and I was surprised Lady Detective Ramotswe didn't figure it out sooner. The tone of the novel is nice and gentle, sometimes bordering on the naive. Still worth reading for something a little different. For another British mystery set in an exotic locale, tryMurder in the Raw: A Rex Graves Mystery (Rex Graves Mystery)by C.S. Challinor."
3,Somewhat Motivational,"I bought this for my 14 year old son, who is always looking to improve his game, and Nash is definitely an incredible player with an interesting Canadian family background that should be included in some part of the video. Clips from some of his games would also help because he is smaller than a lot of the players in the NBA, and it shows that with a lot of hard work and determination, a kid can improve his game. Nash is better than a lot of these taller guys, which proves that height isn't everything in basketball. His stats are incredible. Therefore, more about Nash in his DVD set would be more motivational for the young player."
4,Can't go wrong with the fundamentals!,Steve Nash does a great job on presenting coaches and players a progressive mindset for building their fundamental basketball skills. I love how he reinforces the need to continually practice ball handling skills and why it's important to understand team offensive and defensive positions. Things move very fast on the DVD so you may need to watch it a few times.
2,Not easy to read,"It is awful hard to find an Aramaic Old Testament that reflects the ancient Peshitta text. Happily this one does and it uses East Syriac/Nestorian script instead of the block script found in our Hebrew Tanakhs. Having said that, the script is small, sometimes smudged, and difficult to read. Sometimes the pointing cannot be seen at all. Since I use mine only for comparison of critical texts, the inferior printing is satisfactory. However, it will not make very suitable reading for someone who wants to analyze the Aramaic text, chapter and verse. It seems that inexpensive readable Aramaic Peshitta Tanakhs are in short supply here in the West."
1,NOT ORIGINAL ARTISTS,"Although reasonably well-executed, this CD is performed, in its entirety, by the BB Band, apparently a studio group. This fact is not clear from Amazon's description. In fact, Amazon lists it as ""Various Artists"". The CD itself does not let you know it's by the BB Band on the front cover. It tells you on the side and on the back, in very fine print. I assume people looking for these songs are also looking for the original artists--they should not buy this album."
5,"Steven Spielberg, this one's for you!","Oy, such a movie this book would make! I'm verklempt just thinking about it. Really, someone should get this to Hollywood. I could not put this book down but at the same time didn't want it to end. It was a memoir from nearly 80 years ago but seemed so contemporary at the same time. Don't miss it."
5,Every Page a Gem,"I always appreciate a book that's polished, that shines with the right word in every line. Stella Suberman surely worked long hours to get this book just right. There is a smile on every page, along with an occasional pain, but you'll come away just damn glad you got to know this family. It's truly a triumphant book, a classic with the best of them. I haven't been so glad I read a book in years."
3,Jewish family in small southern town in 1920s,"A fairly quick read about an eastern European immigrant who eventually moves his family to a small Tennesseetown with the specific goal of establishing a ""Jew store"". The family are the only Jews in the community. Eventually the store succeeds but the interesting part of the book is the conflict their religion caused within the family. Eventually the mother wanted her children to marry within their faith and the tension it caused. I would have liked more detail on how the family dealt with their religion since they were the only family in a conservative community and vica versa."
3,Looks good,I haven't read this book yet. It's sitting in my stack of books for travel. I did read the first few pages and I think I'll enjoy it!
2,Rather disappointing,"Based on earlier recommendations here, I selected this for my book group to read. While the story was entertaining and evoked memories of stories told by some of my older relatives, I felt that it was not particularly well written, and would have benefited from some serious editing. The author used language repetitiously, and there was no particularly grace or eloquence to her writing style. Although it was a good chronicle of the family's life, as a literary work, it left me wishing for something richer."
3,Made-up Memoir,"My main criticism of the author is that so much of what she writes about is really a second-hand memoir. She was too young (or not even born) when the events she writes about occurred. She does evoke a feeling for the lonesomeness of her family in a totally unfamiliar situation, but there are too many disconnected memories that are not very interesting. She deals with all her characters superficially. It just seemed to me an amateurishly written book."
5,"For young adults, wannabe adults, and real adults","Imagine being raised in rural Tennessee in the 1920s, the child of a Jewish storekeeper. Imagine this child, quiet and observant, watching, always watching and listening. She listens to family stories well enough to begin her tale prior to her own birth. It's a different tale of anti-Semitism, one that only someone who lived it on intimate terms would be in a position to tell.Engaging writing and a believable narrator contribute to the book's value."
4,Good Read about Jewish Immigrants,I love stories about Immigrants and their struggles to make a life for their families. This is very typical of the hardships our forefathers had to endure to give their families a better life than they had in the 'old country'. I'd like to see a sequel.Contessa
1,Plastic and not Stainless color.,"Received product today, quick delivery. However, the shower head and hose look like chrome, not stainless steel. It does not match the other Delta products I have which are stainless. Box states stainless, but definitely not. Contacted seller to return this product."
5,Wonderful Stuff,Luxuriously smooth and light...long lasting scent...love putting this on after bath or shower...Kim Hatfield
3,Works great for a little while...,"This is the typical replacement color cartridge for some HP inkjet printers (like my OfficeJet 7100). The installation is easy, color is great, but it runs out very quickly. Compared to previous HP inkjet printers, this one last ~1/4 the time."
3,Halloween on Ice,I love to watch Nancy Kerigan and friends skate. In this DVD the skating was good but the overall production doesn't flow between skating sequences. There was too much talking so this one didn't keep my attention.
3,halloween on ice,love the costumes. I dont understand wy need to type 17 words. i dont have anything to say good bye
5,Love these blankets,"I received a 4-pack of these blankets for my daughter and have been using them for 2 months. I love them because they:- Retain their shape and size with washing. Overall, they hold up very well in the laundry and are still soft.- Small enough to fold up neatly in a diaper bag- Larger than most receiving blankets and make swaddling much easier than with smaller blankets. My daughter was a large baby, and other blankets did not even come close to staying wrapped around her, or were too thick to use for swaddling.- Lightweight enough to use in the summer also"
2,Missing about a third of the tale -- Where's the rest of the story?,"Starts out well, moves into a flashback, which is the bulk of the book. At the very end, the tale moves back to the future, but not only fails to explain what exactly is happening, but even fails to explain how things have reached that future point. Isn't that the whole purpose of the flashback? Frankly, I'm prettty p*ssed off and left wondering what the point was.I didn't know there were other books, and it shouldn't matter. This stood alone up until the very end, when you put the book down, feeling like someone left out the last reel of the movie and jumped ahead to the credits."
3,Limited Text,"I love Tigers and everything about it. About this book, I was surprised to read it in less than an hour, it looks like a very short book or a phamphlet. The content it is ok but the title suggest information and documentation on man eaters, but instead is a shallow review of the general situation. I love sundarbans but no recommend this book."
1,BORING AND UNINFORMATIVE,"I feel sympathetic to the author. There was a lot of work placed in this book. Unfortunately for the purchaser or reader there is no story here. I bought this book and read it cover to cover. This book may be of peripheral interest only to those in academia who are wildlife experts or interested in minutiae regarding Bangladesh.This book holds nothing for a wildlife ""enthusiast"" who keeps tuning the pages hoping for something of interest to occur before the last page. It dosen't. Not even on the last page.For those who are interested in fascinating stories of tiger behavior, maneaters or India in the years between 1920 to WWII; the books by Jim Corbett are touchingly tragic, human, tense, humorous and fascinating Vinjets (Spelling?).....short stories, which fill each book and will be re read by the owners of the book every few years for life."
1,Man-Eating Tigers of the Sunderbans,"an author whose personal agenda raises questions about the credibility of victims and their family-members, often the source of her information. Nothing new..seen on National Geographic and numerous other T.V. programs..Sorry I wasted my money.."
4,Maxell iPod Remote,The remote is all I thought it would be. For the price it is great. I am a PE teacher and use it everyday in class. So far no problems.
4,nice but loose,I really enjoy this remote works thru floors and walls i live on a third floor apartment and surprisingly i can change song and volume control from outside my apartment window the only thing i am disappointing is the adjustment to the ipod its not secure if they can only make a clip that to secure the ipod docker it would be the perfect remote EVER!
3,Ehh,"For $12 if you're desperate, it's fine. Nothing to write home about. Cheap plastic, and probably couldn't stand up to really vigorous work, but if you want a stationary product, (i.e. in the car, not on the bicycle) it's fine."
5,"Very intricate and detailed, A+","This book gives you many different views ofPhilip II. Quotes coming directly from text written in the 14th century. Details about every aspect of his life in full detail. When I ordered it for my 11 pg. essay of him, this was exactly what I was looking for."
1,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!,THIS DVD WAS ONLY ABOUT 2.5 MINUTES LONG! A REAL RIPOFF! WHAT A LOUSY TREATMENT OF A WORLD CLASS SUBJECT!!
4,One of a kind,"The first time I heard this band was in 1994,and I instantly fell in love with them.Unfortunately,this is the only album of theirs that I've heard but I must say it has always been a favourite of mine.74:75 is a classic and slackjawed and spiral are are tracks which reveal the bands versatility.I'm really surprised at how few people actually have even heard of this great band.This is a must-buy for any music lover.kadu81@hotmail.com"
4,Very Underrated Band,"The Connells are one of the more underrated bands of the late 80's and early 90's. Having attended college at the University of Georgia; I was very into the Athens music culture and my friends and I enjoyed the eclectic mix of bands playing around town. As a result, I was always looking for new and bands with a fresh sound. I became hooked on the Connells when I found Boylan Heights. I think it's probably their best work, very unique. You cannot help but like ""Over There"" the first time you hear it. The album Ring was very good too and quite different from Boylan Heights. They are able to pull off a mix of songs from ""74-74"" and ""Spiral"" to ""Running Mary"" and ""Doin You"" that most bands can seem to. I am like everyone else; not sure why they didn't hit it bigger; but they developed a great following on the college scene."
5,Bittersweet REM-ish Pop,"This is an excellent cd that I would recommend to fans of older (Green and before)REM. The album has an overall bummer type feel to it, the songs being hook-filled but the lyrics seeming to yearn for missed opportunities in the past. Guaranteed to spend a lot of time in your cd player, but don't put this on if you're already having a bad day! Recommended tracks are '74-'75, Carry My Picture, and Slackjawed, but there is no filler on the album and I'm sure you will find your own favorites."
1,It could have been great,"With an incredible song like Slackjawed on this release, you'd think it would have to be great, but the you'd have to think again. This album is the single greatest dissapointment in my collection. I wish I could have found the single. From beginning to end, (with the exception of Slackjawed) it is boring monotonous has been college pop. I hated it."
5,The Ultimate College Album?,"REM can choke on a rope. This is one of the best college albums ever made. With pleasing structure and solid songs throughout you will be very happy with this one. I saw them when they toured in support of this and they were great. Some of the best southern rock/pop to come out of the early 90s, along with the Judybats. Running Mary is beautiful without being sappy. I gave it to my younger brother right before he left for law school and he played the cassette until it broke. Now I am glad to finally get it on CD..."
2,Smooth cup bra,"This is not a smooth cup bra. I got the natural color. Lighter and pinker than usual. The seams make weird divots all over the front that show under t-shirts and it isn't because it is too big. It fits well, the underwire is lower under the arms. Fantasie is good for short torso women. The material is very scratchy and uncomfortable. Underwire is very stiff. The straps are thin, scratchy and dig. I was very surprised at how uncomfortable it is because Fantasie t-shirt bras are the only ones I wear. I tried to branch out with this one."
5,Cant put the book down. . .,"At the ripe old age of 40 I am embarking on a change of career from an engineer to a programmer and have very limited experience of C,C++.I Have attended the following courses :- C++ Primer C++ for non C programmers C++ & MFCI have not yet written a line of commercial c++ code.I have just bought your Visual C++ 6 starter kit I have spent a fortune on various C++ books and attended expensive training courses too. Your book is by far the best I have ever seen, I cant put it down, it fills in all the gaps and consolodates most of the theory learnt on the recent courses where other books fight shy of supplying syntax. Thank you, Thank you Thank you"
2,"No Detail, But I guess thats what they're going for...","I am an Intermediate/Expert VB Programmer but I don't know anything about C++ or C, This book I think is mainly telling you where to put the code, how to work your way threw C++, but it did not teach me any code, It told me to put the code in the text document and run it but it didn't tell me what I was putting, I recommend this for C++ intermediate and above programmers, not for beginners."
3,What do you expect in 24 Hours?,"I got this just so I wouldn't have to sit through a 600 page book before I could make a windows app. The book exclusively uses the MFC AppWizard (basically point and click where you want stuff to go). The detail wasn't that great but the programs worked and if you have a time budjet, it'll probably be sufficient. Just don't expect to pop out Microsoft Word. If your a beginner to programming in general, learn regular C++ first. VC++ is about 10 times harder and it is vital that you understand Classes and how inheritance works before you attempt programming in Windows."
1,don't buy this one...,"There are almost no pictures, and no screen results of the sample programs it uses in examples. This book is poorly written, and isn't very useful, especialy if you are trying to learn Visual C++. I found ""Teach Yourself C++ in 21 Days"", the old non-visual C++ 5.0, to be a good book (by a different author)...so there's proof that this format works for learning a C++ style language, but this author failed to teach anything. If you can make a program after reading this book, it won't be easy."
1,Waste of time,"I wish I had read the other reviews before I purchased this book because some of them are very accurate. I've been programming for years, but have no Visual C++ experience. I was looking for something to get a quick start. With more difficulty than should have been necessary, I made it all the way through most of chapter 8, at which time it became a complete waste.The author skips from topic to topic and does not explain the fundamentals behind major concepts. Multiple pages are used to list every property for different controls and yet space cannot be found to explain basic ideas.This is a typical example of a good concept (learn something without reading a book that's too heavy to carry) that was not implemented well. Either it was rushed to press too soon or they should have found a more appropriate author."
4,Good Book! Easy to understand and follow.,"I am a complete novice, and actually completed the first 3 lessons in 3 hours. The book is accurately written, the instructions are understandable, and the study guides at the end of each lesson are thoughtful. I strongly recommend this book for beginners."
1,YOU WILL NOT LEARN VISUAL C++ BY READING THIS BOOK,"Disaster! Bad! If you are learning Visual C++, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. You WILL NOT learn Visual C++ in 24 hours and you will be tired from this book. You will NOT learn visual c++ by reading this book. That means that you won't read this book to the end... Read another book."
1,Worst Technical Book in History,"From now on I'll read reviews. This was an agonizing misery. With a dual undergraduate degree in Physics and Aerospace Engineering, a graduate degree in Nuclear Engineering and one in Computer Science - a book has finally made me say ""uncle"" - after only two chapters, yet! This should be pulled from the book shelves and subjected to a book burning......."
1,Worst Book Ever,"I read this book expecting atleast a hint of explanation of what the lines of code do, but I had no such luck. This book read more like a set of instructions that told you what to do, but never really told you why and I even have some C and C++ programming experience.Save You Money!!!!!!"
2,This book sucks,"I've read the 1st 2 chapters of this book and I'm am totally lost. The author uses words without explaining what they mean. I am also lost when the author tries to walk me through something. I have a good understanding of Visual Basic 5.0 and C++, and I was still lost. I am ditching this book and buying another one."
2,Not for the uninitiated,"I'm sure that this book would be great, IF you had a working knowledge of C++ first. The only reason I got the book was for the compiler, and possibly to learn C++. I quickly found out that the book itself was completely lacking on any real C++ instruction. I think its really great that I can build a dialog box...but its absolutely useless to me if I can't call up the dialog box from a program that I've written. So therefore I'm on another book learning C++ and will come back to this one when I feel I need to build programs in windows. Again, If you want to learn C++, this is not the book to do it."
1,You will need to buy another book for certain,"How much can they expect to tech you in 24 hours? Well they don't except much at all. In fact they skim over topics, and at the end of the day, you only know how to program the programs like the ones available in this tutorial. Very little attention was paid to explination. I'm a seasoned C/C++ programmer just starting Visual C++, and I was left confused to the Hows and Whys of the code. Although to the credit of the author, the code is almost bug-free."
1,Dreadful,"I was able (with considerable difficulty) to follow this book up to Hour 7.However, Hour 8. just lost me completely.Tried to follow the Listing examples 8.6 and 8.7 but didn't have a clue what ""It's just an include file, so don't add it to the project"". No explanation what a project, source file, header file or their relationship to each other. Informal remarks like this are downright misleading to anyone learning the language.It may be simple to you, Mickey Williams, but you don't explain the subject particularly well.Definitely NOT recommended."
1,Useless,"I bought this book for 3 main reasons: It says, ""This book does not assume you have any experience with the C or C++ programming languages"", I noticed it had information on MFC, and it was only $24. This is intended for experienced C++ programmers that want to use the MFC AppWizard. The author constantly introduces concepts without explaining them in the afore; assuming you know, which is contrary to it not assuming any programming exp. In addition, many instances he says ""you can..."", but doesn't tell you HOW; or why, etc.It's amazing how the Variables--probably the most important concept in programming--section is only 2/3 pages long (that includes discussions on how much space they take in RAM). Certain chapters are incomplete and vital information scattered throughout the book. ""Visual C++ in 24 Hours""??? I've been reading it for 2 weeks!Definately a waste of time."
3,Nice book if you allready know some C++,"I used this book when I needed to start programming in Visual C++ and MFC, but already knew some C++ from Borland and the C++ language from school.It was usefull to me and at a good start level for me at that moment. One thing I did not like was the description off for example how to edit a menu resource. You read a story of two pages you do not understand, if you do it yourself in Visual Studio all the steps are the ones you would logicly try to edit such a resource. Another big drawback off this book is thatit is really MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes) oriented andMFC is obsolete and old.If you are in the same position as I was, it's usefull, if you do not know any C++ yet buy the famous Stroustrup book. If you already have a lot of programming experience and want to know some Visual C++, just play with Visual Studio and do some tutors"
1,Confusing,"I've gotten other ""...in 24 hours"" books and like them but this one is confusing. The author's thoughts and directions seem scattered. I'm frustrated I paid money for this book."
4,A Great Story,"A really interesting account of women's (slow) progress into politics from someone who lived it. Harriet endured a lot of bias and discrimination as she ran for public office (won some and lost some) and found that running was the easy part! She headed up the Women's Poltical Caucus and made it a credible force for women in politics, she opened many doors for women who came later. For me, with a new interest in politics and a desire to see women play a greater role in our democracy - Harriet's story is important and necessary background."
4,A good account of the battle,"Sword has written a well-researched and detailed history of the battle. There's a good balance between coverage of military movements and personal stories. My only complaint is the same that I have for every other book of this type - not enough maps to give the reader a totally clear picture of events. Nevertheless, I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in the battle of Shiloh."
1,not worth your money,not an enjoyable read. my bother and I both disliked this book very much. it is very slow and lags a lot.
4,funerals,Looks like a welcome addition to my classroom library. Can't wait to see who reads it first.
3,Whammy bar,"The whammy bar/handle didn't work. Very disappointed granddaughter. Not sure what else I need to say, just disappointed in the product."
4,These guys know how to rock,"these guys are from kenosha, wi and i live in racine and i bought the wax romantic when they were still fairview dr and ive been to 6 of their shows. what can i say except this band is exceptional, this cd is filled with emotive lyrics and crazy guitar riffs. i recomend it to anyone who likes good music. i dont know what it reminds me of. its a sound of its own nothing to compare it to. but u shud buy it"
3,Archetypal Star Trek,"The Star Trek (The next generation) are sent to Beltaxiyan Minor to negotiate a treaty with the insectoids there. Typical of all Star Trek novels I have read and seen, something goes terrably wrong. The Insectoid race lives and thinks a hive metastability which complicates relationships. Individually, it seems, each crew member on the away team gets into serious trouble. The odds are against them, but somehow (surprise surprise) they pull it off in the end. The thesis is archetypal Star Trek: They ain't like us, but in some ways they are exactly like us, we just need to understand them. I think the author pulls that off okay. Some reviews said is started slow. Maybe so, but I enjoyed the writing enough all the way through.If you like Star Trek stories I think you will like this one as well. Good, but not brilliant by any means."
1,"The Jarada culture is interesting,and that's all!!!","There is only one word to descibe this book:BORING!!!This book was so boring that I almost didn't finish it.It rates at the top of my least favorite ""star trek"" books(right up there with ""Crossroad"")Stareing at cracks in the ceiling is more fun than reading this book."
1,Ant people try to join the Federation.,"This book was the SLOWEST STUPIDEST book I'veever read in all the 20-30 Star Trek Books I have.These ""ant"" people are bugs that are trying tojoin the Federation. But they are really kidnappingthe doctor of the Enterprise (Crusher) to curethier ""maddness"".This book was such a bore The author should be shot.At least there is no way a book can get any worse."
2,charge does not hold,"We bought this toy for our son for xmas. Initially, the copter was flying beautifully, hovering really high. After a few charges, the copter stopped holding the charge and would not fly over a foot off the floor. We tried to replace the 9 volt battery with a brand new one but this did not fix the problem. Needless to say, it lasted only 1 day. A lot of fun yet disappointing performance"
1,I wasted approximately $30.00.,"I bought this for my grandson in October as a Christmas gift. When he opened it up he was very excited b/c he had wanted one since he had seen them demonstrated in the mall. He charged the battery, took it outside and the saucer part melted and shorted out. He never even got the thing up in the air, and to top it off a company name or address is'nt located on the box anywhere to contact the company for a replacement. My rating for this toy is a ***********ZERO*************!"
1,JUNK!!!,"My son's hovercopter was probably flown about 10 times max and then all of a sudden it just won't work anymore. NO really bad crashes or explanation for it to stop working, it just did. Very disappointed."
1,Piece of crap,I bought this for my son and it worked fine for about a couple hours. The housing for the propeller broke and it wouldn't fly. I called the 800 number back in December and asked for a new one its april and i still haven't recieved one THE COMPANY DOESNT EVEN CARE or they're just so backed up and sending the products back to people because none of them worked.THEY'RE ALL WORTHLESS PIECES OF CRAP
2,it won't leave the ground,i purchased this for my son's birthday. it would not leave the ground. we followed all the instructions closely. i returned it to the store and got another. same thing happened. it's a really cute idea. but just dosen't work.
4,THis is The best rc I have ever had!,"I saw this on tv and it looked cool, but then i saw copies and some at my mall that were 40 bucks!, but I was looking at rc cars at a store one day and i saw the hovercopter, and it was the last one left! i bought it and it was so cool! but it does tend to bump stuff alot, And the blade is not safe, it hurts, i learned it the hard way, but anyways those people who wrote bad rewiews are inept. Nothing will last forever,. oh and to that lady i sweriously doubt that it melted, and it only takes 10 minutes to charge, that liar, not 20, or 30, you people that gave bad rewiews lied bout tons of stuff ,and it will give to 10 minutes of play time, i think some has been exagerating, yes it isn't very durable but it is worth the 20 bucks, All in all, this is a garunteed great time of fun!I am gonna buy the field charger!"
1,Worthless Toy,"The hover-copter is worthless junk. My husband purchased one for my son for Christmas and it flew for about five minutes before it broke...the propellor woudn't stop spinning even after the remote was turned off. I called the 800 number and after an incredibly long wait was told to return it to the toys r us or they would gladly ship me a new one for $8.95 (shipping and handling). I exchanged it at toys r us for a new one, charged the copter, put in a new battery and the new one doesn't work...this time the copter doesn't respond to the remote. I called the company off and on for four hours and when I finally got through the guy didn't have any suggestions other than to return it...which I will gladly do. Save yourself the hassle by not buying this toy. It is unfortunate that I am unable to give this product zero stars because that is truly what it deserves!"
2,fun while it lasts...not too long,"I bought it for my daughter. It was fun for the first day, after that it had trouble holding its charge. It would fly for about 3 min. Then the styrofoam began to have cracks in it. Finally, the propellor kept falling off and it would not get off the ground at all. All this happened in the course of 5 days with normal use!! It was fun while it lasted. Buy it only if you consider it a disposable toy!"
1,Save yourself $20 and a crying kid!!!,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my five year old son. It broke in 20 minutes! I thought it would be the styrofoam body that would be the first to go but I was wrong, it was the propeller!! It just stopped working! It would spin but it was spinning the wrong way! Yeah, so now this thing is broken and my son is crying because he barely had a chance to play with it. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,DIDN'T WORK OUTSIDE,IT WORKED IN THE HOUSE FINE AND AS SOON AS WE TOOK IT OUTSIDE IT WOULDN'T GO UP IN THE AIR. DON'T USE IT OUTSIDE!!!
2,It won't fly!,The big problem with our Hover Copter seems to be that the propeller blades touch the surface of whatever its taking off from. As a result it gets stuck and then flips over on take off. A take off from a smooth surface with lots of room seems best but not on an asphalt road either.
2,It was fun while it lasted,"I purchased 2 of these, one for myself and one for my daughter. After charging the recommended time, the first hovercopter flew wonderfully for about 3 min., then it could no longer get itself off the ground. So I plugged it back into the charger. Despite repeated attempts, this hovercopter never took a charge again and eventually was unable to spin at all. Spash 1 hovercopter. (49mhz))Opened the second hovercopter (27mhz)....charged it up the recommended time...wouldn't spin at all. Then by luck, my daughter squeezed the 49mhz trigger she had from the first hovercopter. And it worked! So the company must have package mis-matched transmitters and receivers. This second hover copter flew beautifully, and flew for almost 10 minutes. This time, the hovercopter was able to be recharged multiple times. Now comes the bad news, the next morning, this hovercopter showed the same problems at the first one. It could no longer take a charge.Both are being returned today."
2,Disappointing,The toy takes 15 minutes to charge and then runs out of steam after 5 or 10 minutes which is very frustrating to a 10 year old boy.
2,Not worth the money,"My 7-year-old son LOVES this toy, but it really isn't worth the price. It takes at least 15 minutes to charge and then the charge only lasts about 2-3 minutes. It flips over easily which means you're constantly running after it to right it so it will fly again. It would be worth it if it were cheaper, a good ""dollar store"" toy. Very cheaply made."
2,Hover dies after 2 minutes !,"Stay away from this toy. Charge lasted about 2 minutes, then you need to recharge for at least 15 minutes! Directions do not tell you to place it on floor or ground , when you are launching it."
2,Don't buy unless you like to waste your money,"I also bought this for my son's birthday. I thought it would be more durable. It is mostly styrofoam and breaks easily even when being careful not to crash it on anything hard. You will be lucky if it flies for 5 minutes per 20 minute charge. Most of the time your lucky to get it to 10 feet high. Once in awhile my son got it up 20 feet. He was excited about that, but it would never do it more than twice per charge. After two days of use, the styrofoam was so broken, he could no longer play with it. Look's like a neat toy, but its cheap and flimsy."
2,IT ALWAYS LOOKS GREAT ON TV,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SON'S B-DAY.HE PLAYED WITH IT CONSTANTLY FOR THE 1ST WEEK. ONLY ONCE DID IT EVER GO HIGHER THAN 2 FEET. THE REST OF THE TIME, IT BARELY HIT 3 INCHES, AND THE PLASTIC PIECE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT IS CRACKED .DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.!!!!!!!"
5,Totally Cool Toy!,"This is a great toy for the money. It is more durible than you would think. My 9 years old hasn't broken it after several weeks - the dog has even taken a bite or two at it. It really works as advertised. You charge it up (takes about 15 min.), aim the remote control and it takes off. You control how high it goes by how much you pull on the remote's trigger. It has enough of a charge for about 5 min. of play. It safe indoor play...drives the cat crazy. It is also great fun at night, as it has a changing color LED on it's spinning side, giving a UFO halo appearance. Neat!"
1,Short Lived....,"My son recieved this as a gift. He was so excited at the time, after seeing all the commercials on TV. Well, the first charge lasted about 10 minutes, and he enjoyed the flashing colors that the HoverCopter made. After the first charge, we immediately recharged, and each time it lasted about 5 minutes. As stated in other reviews, the toy is made of styrofoam, and is very flimsy. What a disappointment. I would not recommend this toy to anyone!!!"
1,THE WORST TOY,i got this toy and it needs to be recharged first it didnt leave the ground and when it did ih was out of battorys! its only playing time is 1min if you want to have it then get the better one
1,made me cry,"i am a 9 year old boy that wanted this toy.I mowed lawns, cleaned gutters,raked leaves,washed cars,waved signs,handed out flyers,dumped garbage for stores,made sure people wiped there feet before they entered there store,washed peoples windows,i had a dog walking buisness,i watched pets for people,i recycled bottles,cans,newspapers,i colleted change from off the ground,got groceries from my grandma.I did all of these things every day.About 2 years later i had collected 800$.I was very proud.I decided to buy all of my friends 1 of these.i bout 40 of them and my parents paid for tax.When we all went to try them out only 8 of them worked!Then 6 of the propellers died out in the first 20 min.The other 2 proppellers died out in 1 hour.WE FULYL CHARGED THEM.I worked so hard to get what them for my friends.I will now kno to not buy any of thos epiece of crap things cuz they suck soooooo bad and i wanna soo the friken maufacter>THEY HAVE NO IDEA HOW HARD I WORKED!~"
1,Beware of seller,Was supposedly new but had been opened according to sell(susiesattic) It was a birthday gift for my grandson. You can imagine mine and his dissapointment when he opened it on Dec.28th and the switch on the controller was broken off and missing. Seller's reply was we had to respond within 3 days of purchase which was not possible. Would advise no one to order from Susie's Attic I certainly won't.
1,Hit or Miss,"My wife just bought this toy for our daughter, since it looked so interesting. The first night, we all had fun playing with it. By the next morning (after charging it all night), it would only lift about two or three inches off the floor. By that afternoon, the battery would no longer accept a charge - the toy was dead. After tinkering with it for about an hour, I gave up and had to console my daughter's tears. From reading previous reviews, it seems that some are lucky enough to have bought one of the saucers that was assembled with little or no flaws, and others (most of us) are unlucky enough to purchase a piece of crap. These toys are poorly assembled from the cheapest materials available (including the so-called ""rechargeable"" batteries). Unless you're a gambler, stay away from this way-overpriced toy. Buying junk like this will only end up breaking your child's heart."
1,Hover Copter Too Flimsy For Consumers,"After seeing this copter at a XMAS party, I was impressed enough to order two on line for a low price. They arrived fast. One did nothing at all and went right back in the box. The other revved up; but was so wobly and out of balance - would try to hover and then flip over! (They are VERY delicate and made of lightweight styrene foam --so they can ""fly""). I was disappointed and I'm guessing the two I saw at XMAS party were flukes. Not worth the trouble and I doubt one can expect a better model in this design. A double return - not even sure if I've been credited back the cost of shipping return."
3,"good, could be better","First of all, this toy is very fun! You can make it go up and down, but not side to side. Me and my friend got it to go pretty high. Especially when we stood directly under it. However, you can only play with it for 5 min, and only with about 3 min of full power, then it runs out of power and you have to charge it for 15 minutes.It has a little blinking light which looks neat-o in the dark. It's made of styrofoem with a little plastic propeller on the bottem which really hurts if you accidently put your finger in there. Over all, I'd say that you get what you pay for."
4,She Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool,"A good cd. The artists, in general, did an outstanding job. There are only a couple that I am not too wild about, but overall - a very good job."
1,This album lacks luster,"Sorry guys,This album is really horrible. It just reflects her musical career as mediocare and poor choices in who honored her. Everytime I see her on television, she comes of as arrogant. It is hard to pull off a tribute album when someone is covering songs of an artist who did ""cover songs"". I will give her the props that she had a sucessful television show and one big hit ""Country when country wasn't cool""(Reba version was akward) but her career does not merit much from music critics."
2,IT IS BAD,"I had sony 510A DVD writer. and so far have tried philips and memorex DVD+R media. All my bad ones are from memorex. When I first got the memorex, I can feel the build quality is worse than the philips, it is thinner. after serveral of the toasts, I decided to not to use it. It also waste me a lot of hours."
1,Poor quality of Memorex DVD+R,These blank DVD's by Memorex are not compatiable with all brands of DVD burners. I spent many hours in determing that my problem was not with the hardware or software but with the Memorex DVD disk itself. I now have 25 blank DVDs of no use to me.
1,Awful discs,Don't waste your money on these like I did. I've burned 3 discs so far. They barely play on my dvd player - some of the titles of the dvd are missing. They are unreadable on my computer's dvd drive.
5,Brand new to this stuff..,"I THINK THIS KIND OF STUFF IS WAY COOL !!! I HAVE TO FIND OUT HOW TO START BURNING CDS AND MP3S, WHAT DO I NEED- HOW EXPENSIVE IS IT TO GET STARTED?"
4,Works great but with one problem for me,I have burned about 10 movies so far out of the spindle and haven't had any problems. But if you have a nec nd-1100a burner you can not burn at 4x only 2.4x. Nec is not going to make a firmware to fix this problem.
1,6 out of 25 are bad...,"I've burnt around 25 and there are already 6 that gave me write error with my 4x Sony CRU-510UL. The ID code of the material is ""CMC MAG F01"". This makes me worry about how long the data on these discs will last..."
1,I waited 3 weeks for them to come and they only register 2.4,I burned 40 TDK discs at 4x while I was waiting for my Memorex discs to come. I figured they would be high quality.. but they refuse to burn at 4x. If I wanted 2.4x Media I would have bought a 2.4x drive. Definately be wary.. if you are burning a lot of discs.. the difference in time is going to add up real quick.
1,stay away... recent quality is TERRIBLE,"I've previously purchased Memorex media DVD+R and have not had any problems until recently. My latest purchase has given me infinitely more grief and frustration than the initial purchase price... Where do I start, how about the fact that the media is labeled as 4X and only burns at 2.4X (gray spindle)? How about the fact that files and videos have errors causing file corruption and/or video dropouts (stutter or DVD lock-up)?. I thought it was my recorder until I read all the reviews... There has been a HUGE drop in quality recently. If you want to gamble with the recent sub-par quality of the Memorex branded media and ""hope"" every thing turns out ok by all means make your purchase here. For me, I'm dumping more than 50% remaining on the spindle because the media is completely unreliable and worthless for anything other than coasters."
1,50 % of the discs are good,"Media looks great, but problems start if you want to record something. I just could not close more than 50% of discs. Since DVD recording is not very fast process, 50% of failures is a terrible waste of time. I will never buy any media of Memorex in feature."
1,every other disc a coaster,I was very disappointed with this product...out of 25 blank discs only half were useable...and for the money spent this was not acceptable. I was shocked I thought Memorex was top of the line in everything...but I guess this wasn't true with its DVD+R blank discs.
1,BMW it is not; KIA it is!,"I bought one of these at a local store, and was reasonably satisfied with it. I needed a couple hundred blanks, so I ordered 9 spindles from Amazon, mainly because of the price. BIG MISTAKE! The quality is VERY inconsistent. Two spindles were all good. The other 7 had anywhere from a couple to over 10 bad media. Even the ones that burned fine, were spotty at points. Two burns were approximately 20 mins burn, 20 not, then 20 burn, 20 not! forming concentric circles on the platter. I realise now that a project worth my time, LOTS of time, is worth a few more pennies.You are not saving anything, because you are likely NOT getting 25 good ones for your money. STAY AWAY unless you really feel lucky you will get the rare fault-free spindle."
5,Great Media,I've been using these blank disks on a Micro Advantage 4DVDRW-B13 with Roxio Classic Creator. The DVD burner is a little generic but the Memorex media works perfectly at 4x. I tried Fujifilm first and got coasters. I should have started with Memorex. I've used almost 50 Memorex CD-R's in the past month or so without a single coaster and I'm sure the DVD+R's will be just the same. I'm not quite to 50 yet but I'm well on my way and no coasters yet.
1,Terrible Media,Recommend RiData DVD-Rs. I bought a 100 pack of the memorex with bad results and ignored customer support. Wasted money.
1,Waste Of Money,"I bought these discs at CompUSA because I needed a few before I got the ones I ordered online. Well, I just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs, I got one that burned good. Not much bang for the buck. I have burned many discs but never Memorex, usually Verbatim or Ridata or MAM. Very disgruntled with these discs making coasters. Maybe my burners don't like them but whatever the case, I won't buy them ever again. I thought Memorex made good products?"
2,Unreliable,"I bought two packs of these, and for some reason, about half of them or maybe one third don't come out well. When you burn it looks like everything went well, and your computer tells you that the burn was successful, but when you play it, the beginning of the film or whatever you are burning comes out good, but about half way through, the dvd player starts jamming up, and I've tried them in other dvd players, not just my Sony, and the same happens. I've tried with different software too, I've had better results with Nero Express, but the same problem occurs. These problems don't happen with HP discs I bought or Verbatim, so the problem must be these discs. I'm just putting this down so as to warn people out there."
1,"memorex media was good in the past, but not now","memorex changed the manufacturer of their media from RITEK/RICOH tocheap CMC.I've burned dozens of DVD disks successfully in the past with myburner, with Memorex(Ritek), TDK, Fuji, and verbatum media, but my last 25 pack of Memorex, 23 out of 25 burned UNREADABLE disks."
5,works well with TDK DVD+R 4x drive,"If you use the TDK IndiDVD 4x2.4x12x Internal DVD+R/RW Drive (which is an excellent drive), you have 2 choices:either getMemorex DVD+R 4xorTDK DVD+R 4x blanks.They both work perfectly."
1,stay away,"This used to be great media until Memorex decided to switch to CMC from Ricoh. Now they are horrible, you're lucky to get 20-30% success rate with these."
2,good when it works,"The DVDs I burned successfully showed the movies in excellent quality. The only problem is that for every 3 good burns I get one bad one. I'm using the Plextor DVD burner (love it!!), but I'm going to try my luck with a different DVD brand. The failure rate for Memorex is unacceptable. It's less the cost that bothers me, but more the time wasted on burning coasters."
3,A Gamble,"No compatability problems using an NEC 1100A with the latest firmware , but I notice that only the ones that come in the gray colored spindle burn at 4X. I have received two 25 pack spindles that came in a black base spindle and all of the disks burned at 2.4X even though they are labeled as 4X. Memorex must know about this because they are obviously color coded. So the score is 3 stars for the three grey spindles I have purchased that burned at 4X, and no stars for the 2 black spindles that only burned at 2.4X. Do you feel lucky?"
1,Terrible consistancy!,"Don't bother with this media. It used to be quality stuff up until about four months ago when Memorex switched suppliers from Ricoh to CMC. I bought a batch of the Memorex Ricoh's and they all worked flawlessly, unlike the new CMC's. At least half of the CMC discs were unreadable once burned. Even if the burn was successful, the media had problems with many standalone DVD players. Stay far away! Quality DVD+R media can be found for around the same price if you can find the right sales."
2,Beware of OEM Change,"These disks used to be great in my NEC ND-1100A, but Memorex changed the OEM from Ritek to CMC. Now, they only burn at 2.4X."
2,These DVD-Rs suck,"I used a 25 pack of these doing DVD backups, and the last 5 or so failed. I thought it was my software, so I got new software. Guess what? My first disc out of the new package of 25 that I bought failed, too. It's not my burner (as another reviewer suggested, implying that people should learn to read), as it's brand new and doesn't require the firmware upgrade they mention. They just suck and have a high failure rate. So the consensus seems to be that TDK or Sony are best. I'm buying some now and save myself the frustration."
2,The good gone bad,"I'm afraid I have to agree with the other previously happy Memorex users in noting that Memorex quality/success rate has gone downhill. I was skeptical when I read the other reviews and I stuck with Memorex, but I have seen the light now. For a year I was very successful with the DVD+R Memorex disks. In the 25 pack spindles I would buy, they would all work....so in Aug '04 I bought 2 25 packs at Circuit City (a mistake?). That appears to have been a waste of money. I just tried to burn a copy of something and I ended up trashing 4 disks in a row. I was convincing myself it was my hardware or program or something else. Then I remembered someone had given me a blank Sony DVD-R disk, so I thought what the heck, let me try that one. Into the SONY drive it went and it copied without a hitch. That was the final straw for my Memorex loyalty. Out of a pack of 25, I have about 10 left, but have had to trash 6 of the 15 I used. Not a good success ratio. Bye Memorex."
2,Low Quality Media,"This is very low quality media. The quality can even differ from each individual disk, instead of per batch like with most disks. A lot of my burns don't end up having proper quality. Sure, they burn fine, and may even work for the average user, but the quality is very low. I now know why the price was so low. My recomendation is to find some TDK or Verbatim media equivalent, which may have the same Media Code in the ADIP ""RICOHJPNR01"", but it is of much higher quality. Try to avoid Memorex media as much as you can."
4,House Vs Trance,"This is the best house can get, zimms has the imagination to define his trip in the great songs on the record. Just make sure you pump up the volume, happy trippinbp"
3,ancient egypt,"found the book somewhat out of date, and too technical for the ordinary reader. It could do with a detailed modern summary to set it in its proper time and context"
4,Most of the book are just translations ...,"Since I didn't find a more compelling book to read about this subject, such as ""The Keys of Egypt"", I read this little book. Most of the book are just translations of the original writings in the Rosetta Stone so just a few words are dedicated to the most interesting part, the story to decipher the egyptian hieroglyphics. Despite of that, I learned a lot with this book, although I wanted more."
3,A Beginning,"I read this book after I'd read the author's two following books about Sunny. Take my word, read this one first. The plot gets entangled and confused, but it is clear that Ms Birmingham has style. After this book, she sorts out how to do plots, and soars from 3 stars to 5 stars."
3,First Effort in what May Prove to be a Good Series,"Atlanta Graves introduces Atlanta PI Sunny Childs. Sunny, part owner and operative for Peachtree Investigations is hired to retrieve a stolen painting. She spends much of her time fronting for absent boss, and Peachtree Investigations founder, Gunnar Brushwood, trying to keep the business solvent, pleasing her mother and dumping her married lover. Set in Atlanta, Sunny moves easily from Dunwoody and glitzy benefits to a ride on Marta to crime-ridden Southwest Atlanta. Author Ruth Birmingham offers a glimpse of Atlanta that makes you feel like she knows the territory (with one glaring error -- a character who majored in Criminal Justice at Georgia Tech). Like many mysteries, the title does not have any real relation to the plot but Sunny may eventually develop into a well-rounded character who could sustain a series."
2,"Buy ""Fix it Write"" instead of this","The book comes with a CD with lessons that replace half of the book. The CD images are too small to read and need to be printed.It's too bad because the lessons are excellent. Instead of this, buy ""Fix it Write""."
2,Great relay (in warm climates),"Relay works in wet conditions, but they stick in cold weather. If you leave them turned on for 15 minutes or so they'll heat up enough from the current in the coils to click on."
3,Don't Believe FULLY the Instructions of others.,This relay works well for those FreeWay Blaster Horns I got from Amazon.But I easly broke the Metal Bracket from the PLASTIC Box. But the Bracket is not the Ground for the relay. Just a hanger. I followed the Instructions of someone on installing these Horns and Relay from his Web Site.ONE thing he Failed to mention.( I read and searched his Info 3 Times) That the Center Contact on the Relay is the Ground for the Relay. I had to trouble Shoot for about 15 minutes trying to figure out why the horns would not work. Today they are Loud and Clear.
4,Dosnt work quite well in the cold,"It dose what its supose to do. It takes a while to warm up when its cold though, but thats never really a problem. Solid for a ""Made In China"" product."
1,BAD PURCHASE,I TRIED TO PLAY THE DVD ON THREE DIFFERENT VIDEO SYSTEMS AND THE RESULTS ON ALL THREE WERE THE SAME. THE VIDEO PORTION WAS DISTORTED AND SKIPPED FRAMES. THE AUDIO ALSO SKIPPED. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PURCHASE.
5,A True Soul Survivor,"This DVD was a very pleasant surprise. I thought it would be a lot of previously seen film footage of JB performances, but the real focus was getting to know James Brown, the man. Learning his beginning and seeing all he had to overcome made his music more personal. I bought a copy for my father who grew up in Augusta at that time and he loved seeing the pool hall they all played in and he recognized other popular hang out spots. A great gift for anyone who is a true JB fan. If you love his music, you will love this DVD. It was money well spent."
3,Falls apart easily.,"This arm band started to fall apart very shortly after purchase. Despite it's dilapidated state, it continued to function for a while but just barely."
4,Good product!,"I am satisfied with this product in general. I don't use it every day but for the time I needed it worked just fine. It fits well in my arm and doesn't move when I am jogging as long as I get it tight. The only problem, is that the whole for locking/unloncking the iPod is too small and I have to find it over the case. I would suggest it."
4,Great Powerpop from Australia,"The ""critical review"" above makes no sense. I don't see why this Saints album is so much like the Sixties.This is a fine powerpop album like Midnight Oil without the politics. Also more variety: The First Time is punkish; another song is Celtic; the title track is a slower, very cinematic piece. Plus the great single, Big Hits On the Underground."
5,As I Bow To The Boys Of Bodom,Children of bodom in my opinion is one of the best metal bands out there. Their guitar and keyboard work is breath taking. There infallible rhythm and warm harmonies make them one of the most amazing metal bands to listen to. The whole band comes together with the thundering drums and intense guitar. I would suggest buying every cd by them and there posters.
2,"Great movie, poor transfer though","Fans of movies on Egypt, Biblical times as well as anything that talks about the ancient world will love this. I won't spoil the movie, suffice to say that this is the story of a young king caught in a battle with the old order and who has to face more than just one foe when he wants to change things.Pharaoh has been hailed as the ""lost filmic treasure"" and truly this is the case.So much about the story. The reason why I only give 2 stars to this is because the transfer onto DVD has simply not worked. It is very poorly done and the quality of the picture is simply not acceptable in that day and age. I already have a German version of this movie and the transfer and quality of the picture is superb. But I wanted it in English and am quite disappointed about this version."
4,Great if you love Jamba Juice,"I bought this book because I love Jamba Juice smoothies, but I don't really have one close to me. While I admit that there's only a couple recipes in this book that I've made, I love them. I'm glad I have this book on-hand.You can certainly make any combination of smoothy that you like, but it's great to have some yummy basics to start with."
4,Did Jesus ever visit England?,"I borrowed this book from the library more than once in the 60's and 70's and remember it as a great read for a lazy afternoon. From what I recall, the plot is told from the view point of Joseph of Arimathea and revolves around his household and his slaves. He is a trader and has ships that go as far as Spain and England (Avalon). He brings the child Jesus with him on a trip to England and the book deals with his understandable confusion and scepticism of our Lord's claims and teachings. The storyline brings us up to Calvary and just beyond. I'm thrilled to see it is still available and now on audio."
5,Elemental Gearbolt,I Just bought a used copy of a PlayStation game called Elemental Gearbolt and it looked like it never was open brand new so thank you. It was in much much better shape then i ever thought it would be so thank you.I haven't had luck every time with buying games online by the way the sellers name is media werk
5,A College Classic,"As far as college bands go, I think the Connells are better than REM, but that's just me. And this album is a must-have for anyone that likes the band. The songs cover a huge range of styles, from acoustic to hard rock."
1,NOT Original Singers,It's a cover band singing all of these songs. I was highly disappoionted after spending $....
4,The only one you'll need,"If your're looking to buy this book then you've probably heard of the legendary book titled ""Texas Boots"" now out of print. Don't fret--this book is better. Whereas the older book was mostly black and white, this one has beautiful color pictures, and most of the bootmakers listed here are still alive. In fact, if you buy this book don't bother to consider ""The Art of the Boot"" by the same author as the two books are about the same, except that Art costs more and has a few more pictures, but the Cowboy Boot Book has a much better history of the cowboy boot."
4,Cowboy Boot Book,I was curious about the history and construction of cowboy boots so I purchased this book to provide me with some background information about them. Great book. And practically all the boot makers mentioned are still in business! I think I want some cowboy boots after reading this book
4,Good Stuff!,"This stuff does what it says it will do. I was having to use a product to control frizz and mousse for control. This product does both. I tried other things that ""swore"" to straighten out the curl and frizz with a blow dryer and was disappointed. I would recomend this to anyone with curly frizzy hair. The real test will come when I sit out on a humid night like last week! (Yuck) I had worked so hard and even used ""Humidity Control"" hairspray along with many other products. We shall see!!"
2,okay product,i was hoping this would straighten and reduce frizz. no such luck. it leaves your hair greasy if you apply too much. and my hair was really frizzy .
3,GOD'S GRACE,THIS IS GEARED TOWARDS THE YOUNGER GENERATION AND IT HAS A GOOD R&B FLAVOR WITH A GOSPEL TWIST.
5,T57,I received the cd before the projected time. The cd was in great condition; no scratches and played perfectly.
5,God's Blessing,"I purchased this album back in 98 when it first came out. Here it is almost 10 years later and I can still pop it in the CD player and get an instant uplifting. From start to finish this album is a solid 5. My personal favorites are ""You can Always Call his name"" ""God's Grace"" ""Mary Don't you Weep"" I love the old school gospel feel of that one. ""Pray for a while"" ""Good for Me"" and ""God's Blessing"" honestly there are no bad songs on this album."
5,Very uplifting!!!!,"I listened to the CD of Trin-i-tee 5:7 and it was great. I am in awe of ""Call His Name"" because it has a good beat. I also like the CD because the songs talk about God in a positive way. I urge anyone to buy this CD if they like urban contemporary gospel."
5,Amen.,"And Amen. Good -- righteous -- pure -- holy -- sounds of praise -- are only some of the WONDERFUL things I have to say about this recording, and album. Ladies, if you're reading this, AMEN, and AMEN. Keep us encouraged!"
4,GREAT,"I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THEM AT A PRAISE FEST IN MALTIMORE,AND THE SISTERS ARE A BLESSING. THEY HAVE VERY STRONG VOCALS AND ARE TRUE TO THEIR FAITH. I AM A 40 YEAR OLD MOM AND I HAD THE PLEASURE OF INTRODUCING THEM TO MY TWO OLDER CHILDREN 23 AND 20. THEY HAVE BROUGHT THE STIGMA OUT OF GOSPEL THAT CHRISTIANS ARE OLD ACTING AND DRESSING AS WELL.I ENJOYED THEM THAT I HAD TO PURCHASED THE CD AND IT BLESSED MY SOUL AND CONTINUES TO DO SO,UNTIL THIS DAY. YOU GO GIRLS!!!!! MY KIDS WERE BLOWN AWAY."
3,"Actually, I Think Their Second Project Was Better.","I try to make it a habit normally of listening to the first material first (or a greatest hits collection) of an artist. I listened to Trin-I-Tee 5:7's second project, ""Spiritual Love"", first. If I listened to this first, I may never have tried ""Spiritual Love"".This was good quality, but I think a true R&B; fan would like this better. To me, the songs sounded a little more alike.Please don't be scared off with my review of this project; you may enjoy it better than I did. And especially DON'T AVOID THIS GROUP BECAUSE OF THIS ONE REVIEW! This group clearly loves the Lord Jesus Christ and is dedicated to serving Him.I did like some of the songs from the project, which stood out a little more. The first was the excellent ""I Won't Turn Back"", an aca pella promise of a great project. I also liked ""God's Blessing"", ""Sunshine"", and ""Holy And Righteous""."
1,Can I give 0 stars?,"These shelves are awful.I purchased them from that horrible Chinese supply store known as Wal-Mart and didn't expect much, but I did figure ""It's a shelf, how hard could it be?"" Apparently, I was too optimistic.The shelves come with nails, not screws, even though they come with drywall anchors. Nails for drywall anchors? Really? Nails to hold up shelves? What genius thought of that!?The enclosed nails are are too small for the holes in the shelve arms. The nail goes right through the hole and doesn't hold anything! What's the point? Who designed this? A farsighted dyslexic!?The plastic anchors stick out far beyond the nail, requiring you to hit the plastic (or create a chisel type device).I have installed many, many shelves without incident. These shelves look like they were installed by a 5-year-old. Great job Closetmaid! Keep up the wonderful Chinese craftmanship!"
3,"Okay, but has some issues","I had to cover up the window with duct tape in order to prevent light from making this shredder think the waste basket was full. Apparently it uses an LED to shine light on the waste, and if a phototransistor picks up the light, the basket is considered full, even if the light source is not the LED. A bright room light is enough to make the sensor think the waste basket is full.I often experienced jams when too many sheets were inserted. What's worse than the jams themselves, is that they are not easy to fix by using the manual reverse. I have sometimes spent as long as an hour trying to remove paper which has jammed, by feeding the paper forward and reverse until it either comes out or goes through.I would say that this shredder is only good for light to moderate use. When I have had hundreds of pages to shred, I have overheated it and have had to wait as long as 30 minutes for it to cool down.After using it for 3 years, it is finally in need of replacement."
5,Buy this book!,"This is the first book I have read that really, really addresses the emotional aspects of infertility (not the medical/technical ones) and has answers for how to deal with them. I keep turning to it in moments of lonliness and despair--and it is always helpful. It has brought me a lot closer to God and made me realize that no matter how alone I feel at times, I never am. This book is excellent!"
5,Excellent Book!,"I have found this book to be an excellent resource for dealing with all aspects of infertility, including marital relationships, doctor/patient relationships, and emotional aspects. It has been a great help as I have personally struggled through 2 1/2 years of infertility treatment and one miscarriage."
1,THE WORST MOVIE IN THE SERIES.,"I cant believe how bad this movie is and what a disgrace this is to the series.The story was dull and pointless,while the acting was very bad.Pinhead appears for only 5 minutes and they do nothing with the actress who played kirsty.They only made this movie to milk more profits from this great series.I can only hope that the next sequals are not as bad.NOT RECOMMENDED!!!"
4,Hellraiser VI - Hellseeker ~ Dean Winters,Hellraiser VI - Hellseeker~ Dean Winters is a really well made sequell in the hellraiser series. Ashley Laurence is back for the first time since hellbound. The special effects are quite well made and the script is great being that the movie has a 3 million dollar budget. The music is great for the movie and sets the mood perfectly even to well sometimes. The entire videoe camera scene is so frightening and the psychological drama is totally creepy. It is kind of ironic that he goes to a chiropractor considering that pinhead has pins all over his head. The dialogue is not as poorly written as most horror sequells and is quite good. Pinhead only plays a small part and can almost be seen as doing a small cameo. I highly recommend this movie to all hellraiser fans and fans of great movies.
3,Pleasantly Surprised,"I really thought this movie was going to be beyond redemption. I only rented it because I've seen everything in the tiny video store I frequent.I was surprised that I liked it! No, It was no where near the first ones, not even close, but it wasn't horrible.I liked the way Kristy was no longer little miss innocent, and if she'd gone through all this in real life it's highly doubtful she would still be snow white anyway. I also liked the way the main character's story was told through hallucinations and dream like sequences. I especially liked the way things were neatly wrapped up at the end. I especially liked the female coroner's part.The visuals were very attractive and the story was good if a little predictable.The bottom line is that this film was enjoyable. It was not great art or story telling, but if you run out of great movies a good one is better than nothing at all."
2,Skip this entry into the series,"Maybe I like my movies to be more conforming to normal plot patterns, who knows. All I know is the way the plot jumped around in this movie left me dizzy and frustrated. Plus, I know there's been a desire to concentrate on the human characters rather than the Cenobites, but with this movie all the concentration is on Kirsty's husband--so much so that I became sick of seeing his face after 30 minutes of watching this flick. After Hellraiser II, the series just hasn't been the same."
3,Almost exactly like Inferno with a much better ending,"This movie has pretty much the same story line as Hellraiser Inferno. To me the movie was very predictible if you have seen Inferno. Kirsty barely got any screen time. I found the movie sypnosis very misleading. The acting was very good, and of course Doug Bradley gets 5+ stars for his portrayal as Pinhead. I heard on a website that Kirsty's character wasn't added till right before the film was ready to shoot, and once you watch the movie you will be able to tell. The only thing that did not make me give the movie one star was the ending. I am not going to be blower and blow it away, but it was an incredible ending. The ending will make up for most of the movie. You have to watch it once. I think they should make another one but this time have Kirsty in the whole movie."
4,A very good installment!,"I love the original film and the first sequel.After being disappointed by the 3rd and 4th sequels,I lost interest in this series.Yesterday at the store I decided to give the cenobites another shot,especially seeing that Kirsty was back.Anyway this is a good one.Dark and surreal in tone,this film captures Barker's original vision much more successfully than the 3rd and 4th movies.Slightly fumbled,where all the pices of the plot seem to not fit that well,I still applaud this attempt at a more nightmarish vision.The dvd has 3 alternate scenes fans will love.Interesting director's commentary too."
2,Hellraiser: Hellpiece of Hellcrap,"This is going to be short. I didn't like this movie for a few reasons:a) Little emphasis was put on plot explanation.b) We didn't get to see a lot of Pinhead.c) It wasn't obvious enough that the man had tried to kill Kirsty.d) This movie was just stupid; most useless crap ever. Pinhead had little airtime, and I'm sorry, but they dragged that movie out way too much.Screw you guys, I'm going home.And oh yeah, Pinhead?Shut the hell up."
2,again not really hellraiser,"this one is even less like hellraiser, maybe the filmakers are running out of ideas but, it's like the fifth one.it's basically another detective story but a slightly more boring one that just keeps repeating itself.five reasons why this is a disappointing film1.it's a repeat of hellraiser inferno2.it keeps repeating itself3.it's slow and boring4.it's not really hellraiser(again)5.why does it have pinhead on the front cover if he's hardly in it?thats like the fifth one you expect him to be in it for a bit longer than he is, ok so he has a bit of a longer part in this one but it still is too short.the real main character isnt a very good actor so thats something else that is disappointing.and one more thing, why does the box keep ending up with Kirsty Cotten for no reason?"
3,"At last; -A great; -""Hellraiser."" -Seqeul.! -4 was best","This makes a great entry.. -But; -I half two say. -It'sgreat that finally. -Actress; -Ashley Lawerance.! -Of the first too films. -Finally put back the old traditionfrom the previous; -two films..! -I liked; -the inept.""Hellraiser 4: -Bloodline."" -Becuase. -Kim Myers.! -Was inthat one. -She did a lot better battle with; -Pinhead; -DougBradley.! -Ho have survive. -Five flicks.! -I have not seenthis one yet. -I hope I will pick this one up; -soon.! -Imight as well weight too it drops by on; -Cable.! -I seenthe other; -four films. -Not; -""Inferno."" -I herd their arenot really good reviews on that movie. -Bad 0nes. -SO Irefere two skip it..! -But; -I think; -this one will be alot better film. -As a reviewer. -I don't know why I'mreviewing this. -I seen; -""Hellraiser III."" -It was arealistic; -gory flick; -sequel.! -But; -wood this wood besequel. -Pick up the face of all the; -weakest of the series.You make that decision...!"
1,The only bad one in the series...,"I tried to enjoy this movie, being a huge fan of Hellraiser, parts 2 and 4 being the best ones in my opinion. I was excited when I heard Ashley Laurence (Christy In Part's 1 and 2) was coming back. Her character is barely in this movie for a full twenty minutes. This movie is horrible in general, and compared to the other five hellraiser installements, it's even worse. This movie barely has a plot, and you barely see Pinhead at all.One star is only for the fact it's a Hellraiser Movie, one of the greatest series of all time. Otherwise, this movie is not worth seeing. Get the rest of the series and leave this one out."
3,It's ok,"Not the best of the Hellraiser series but for any fan of the Hellraiser mythos this, like the others that follow down the line, is required to make the collection complete. I got the DVD version so I cannot attest to the quality of the Blu-ray disc. I would have hoped for some extras even on the DVD release but that hope was in vain."
1,What??,"call this a film-no, call it a faliure-yes.I hate this film it is boring and pointless, it is nothing like the first 3 hellraisers, it is just a bloody porno with bits of gore and violence thats all.it is not worth the money not one bit, if you really must watch it then go on, but don't say you haven't been warned.I saw this movie in the early hours on TV, and no wonder it is on at like 1-4 AM, no one watches it then i bet, they just use it as a fill in for when the TV station has no other programs to run :Si'll spit on this movies grave, it is that bad it should not have even been released to VHS or DVD, it is a waste of space (even for VHS :S) so do not buy or rent or even watch this title by anyway."
2,Terrible!!!,"First off let me say that two stars is really being two kind. This is another one on the list of terrible sequels. It's probably just me, but it seems like the more of these movies they make, the worse it gets, and the less we see of Pinhead and the Cenobites. This wasn't scary at all. Frankly, I was bored to tears, and this is a total disgrace to Hellraiser fans. Inferno was already bad enough and they had the nerve to make another (horrible) sequel to add to the franchise. Let's admit it, Inferno was a cop thriller...not a Hellraiser (that was the first clue). They waited 4 whole sequels later to bring back Kirsty Cotton for Hellseeker, and that's the second clue that they are truely running out of ideas. I think the first Hellraiser was a classic, and now it's time to end the madness."
1,YOU FAIL!,"If Inferno hadn't have come out before it, this movie might have been bearable. What it ended up being was an almost identical copy to the previous installment in both story, style, and direction.If youve seen Inferno, be prepared for a suck-fest. If you haven't, you might like it, as long as you aren't a Hellraiser purist..it is nothing like the first 2"
3,Gotta love the Pinster,"Very good entry in the Hellraiser series. This franchise and the Freddy franchise are the two best horror series ever made, in my humble opinion. Although Pinhead could use a little sense of humor. Freddy has so much personality he could run for President and win! I'd vote for him. And I almost forgot the ""Chucky"" franchise, love the direction they went in, it revived the whole concept. Keep em' coming!"
3,Could have been better,"We have Kirsty back, but she is hardly used. What a waste! Pinhead and the other cenobites are barely in the film (another crime) and the story is a series of flashbacks and foreshadowing. How did Chatterer come back to life after being in Hellbound? There are a few pluses though, Stitch and Surgeon cenobites are interesting (though under-used) and Kirsty goes bad & cuts yet another deal with Pinhead. Still better than Inferno."
3,Doug makes what kind of money?,"A few words...Disapointing. Where are the Cyno bytes?I need to see the ""Tortured Souls"" and their victims on screen.What's up Clive?"
2,short and sweet,"I found this movie to be better then inferno by far. 1,2,3 and even 4 are sill watched regularly by me. Hellraiser 6 tumbled along.... To the point were we started getting very frustrated with the way the movie danced around not alowing you to grab it and hold it. Without a doubt this plot was a tare off Jacobs ladder, a rip off The Others, with a back drop of a Xfiles maratathon. And of course a pinch of hellraiser (Because there was a total of 40 seconds of cinobites and a few mins of pinhead). No gore. No real blood baths. Just when the walls started coming down and classic hellraiser feelings started to flow though my body the movie was over. I was just really upset at how UNoriginal this movie was. maybe if Jacobs Ladder and The Others were never made would H6 be a movie worth bringing up. But those 2 movies exsist, and H6 totaly carbon copies them. Very disopointed. Please stop making hellraiser, its starting to feel like tales from the crypt with Pinhead special apperances."
5,completed kirsty journey,"while clive barker only made a few of the 1st originals there are some in this series he didnt make im not sure about this one but w/1,2,3,this one finished off the story for me...very good i love all pin head movies a must have"
3,Keep it coming....,"Much like the last film Hellraiser: Inferno, this sixth entry again takes that Jacob's Ladder/Angel Heart approach with the story. After Trevor's wife Kirsty (yes, from the first two Hellraiser films) dies in a car wreck, he finds himself with a lot of strange situations with creepy imagery, and of course Pinhead himself. The Hellraiser films have evolved into an excellent direct-to-video series, and if they keep making them like this, they can make as many as they want because many people, like me, are happy to sit down every once-in-a-while to enter into the Hellraiser realm."
3,"""Hellbound to Hellsuck...""","Okay, I will admit this, it is a good Hellraiser movie, and it doesn't rely on pitiful gore effects, it relies more on suspense and shadows on the wall. There are many disturbing images seen in this film as well, but the redeeming quality was Pinhead, he was great, and Doug Bradley's portrayal really resurrected the movie from the visions of Dean Winter's character, Trevor. The plot synopsis on the back of the cover art is far from what the movie is really about, it is actually about Trevor struggling to put the pieces back together about how his wife died, let alone finding out if she's actually dead. When the film is over, you get a brand new plot, and that leaves the door open for a sequel, and there actually will be two new sequels, Hellraiser: Deader, due out later this year, and Hellraiser: Hellworld, due out next year. Hellraiser: Hellseeker was a decent sequel, and had more Pinhead than the other movies."
1,This direct to DVD is a total waste of time,The Hellraiser series is not a bad series. In fact most of the Hellraiser films are quite good and even the later ones in the series have some merit.Sadly this one does not because...(1)Hellraiser and the Cenobytes are in it for about 7 minutes.(2)The story is ripped directly from Jacob's Ladder and Angel Heart.It is a TV movie with some interesting production values but just based on points 1 and 2 above I think you have a good idea of where you should keep your money. Don't even bother renting. Maybe next time you see a few seconds of it on the Sci-Fi channel at 4am you will understand how bad this is....
3,Skip this...,"If you are a fan of Hellraiser I and II then skip this please...it's not bad but not good.The storyline is slow and dull, the gore-parts are only for the ears. Typical film of today's horror's, like The Ring.Very well directed with good special effects, but less gore than a horror would deserve.Not so interesting and frightening like the first one was. The ending is nothing special."
1,"AHHH NO MORE HELLRAISER SEQUALS, PLEASE I BEG THEE","I totally hated this movie. don't get me wrong hellraiser is my favorite movie, but the series get more boring as they go along. the only reason i bought this movie is cause kirsty cotton comes back. well, ashley laurence should kick her self for even being in this movie. she was only in it for at least 10 minutes of the film (not even). i thought pinhead and kirsty would be battling. there was no plot at all. i don't recommend you buy this movie, even if you are a hellraiser fan."
1,the sixth entry in the Hellraiser series,"Having seen the previous ""Hellraiser"" films I decided to rent the sixth Hellraiser film Hellseeker. I was excitied to see that Ashley Laurence returned to the series, that is about all to recommend in this film. The story was rather confusing, and very boring, not enough Pinhead. This is basically full of ideas lifted from other horror films. If you're a Hellraiser fan, go out and rent the first movie again. Skip this one!"
2,In the dark,"I've waited years to see this movie, and I'm not sure I have seen all of it yet - between the obvious breaks/cuts and a transfer so dark I couldn't even read the titles. Enjoyed what I could see, but it's such a shame MGM are charging top dollar for such poor quality."
1,Vaughan Axe Review,"I would have to say that I recommend passing on this item. It took for ever to arrive and when it did it was very disappointing. And at this price I really wasn't setting my expectations that high. The axe I received wasn't even symetrical across the head. One cutting edge had very pronouced scallops on both faces forming the ""hollow ground"" edge, but the other side didn't! I've never seen a double bit axe that was so distorted, even the real cheap imports."
3,Awful do not buy,"This film is extremely soft, and not what I would call a good adult film. It doesn't go beyond showing ""beautiful"" (not that amazing) women stripping, you would see more at a strip club honest. Decadence means: A process, condition, or period of deterioration or decline, as in morals or art; decay. Very apt use of the word in the title but not as far as morals but in a decay of what is good and what men want to see in adult films."
5,Excellent,I keep these kits on hand to move sutures from our horses with minor injuries. They are durable and very user friendly.
4,Hmm well I have read the other review here....,I have not opened the kit. It is for an emergency kit I put together. Its all in the package I can see everything in there but I have not opened or used any of it. I bought it as a back up in case I would need these things in an emergency. I am satisfied with the kit. That is all I can say.
2,Pretty Cheap,"I guess you get what you pay for, especially with this set. The scissors were next to useless, dull and misaligned. The forceps were also tough to use.. I won't purchase the again."
4,Nice postcards great for thank you cards!,We used these for my son's thank you cards after his birthday. Each kid got a colorful card to keep with a little note from my son. We saved on postage and we still have many more cards left. Nice quality!
5,At last,"I live in Norway and have been looking for this box for about five years, so finding it here on amazon.com, at this price, with such a swift handling was what we here would call a feather in amazon's hat. And the product is of course excellent. The cards are so nice, I'm struggeling to choose which one to use."
5,Adorable!,"These are the cutest postcards ever- they include movie images, storyboard designs, plannings for the movies and more! and it's all on thick, professional paper and i like it a lot, its so fun!"
3,Not exactly what I had expected.,Had wanted more cards of actual scenes from the movies. A lot of these cards were of pre-production designs. Still a pretty good bargain.
5,Amazing!,"I originally bought these because they were such a good price and I wanted to send them off for Postcrossing. WRONG. After going through them, I decided I had to buy a set to keep for myself!There are NO duplicates- all 100 postcards are original. There's a lot of really great concept art, shorts, random art, and just beautiful cards. They're great, heavy, quality and they come in a decorative box. Movies I found cards from include A Bug's Life, Cars, Geri's Game, Monster's Inc, Toy Story (1 & 2), The Incredibles, One Man Band, The Adventures of Andre and Wally B, Finding Nemo, Knick Knack, Red's Dream, Boundin', For the Birds, and Tin Toy, but I may be missing some as there are so many to go through.I would very highly recommend these cards for anyone."
5,Hard to give away,"I bought these cards for the sole purpose of sending to friends, but I find it hard to part with any of them! 100 postcards, each different, come in a handy little box. To me, each one is a piece of art. You could honestly choose any one at random, frame it, and hang it and it would look impressive. The paper is sturdy and seems to be of high quality. And the price is UNBEATABLE.I bought this along withThe Art of Vintage Marvel: 100 Collectible Postcards, which was equally impressive with a similar box (both sets being from the same publisher), and I highly recommend buying them together."
4,recommended,"I really like these postcards. I hung some of them around the house, and they're really lots of fun.The only problem I have with most postcards is the way the composition was designed: they were brutally cut into the image, leaving a poor claustrophobic composition.Still, many of the postcards look quite good, and I'll recommend this product to anyone."
5,I highly recommend it.,"I've been reading the tarot for over 15 years and this is one of the best books on the subject that I have found. It's one of the first that I recommend to others, and one of the first I go to for reference. It is not the typical book that just lists each card with a predetermined meaning, but it covers how to read, numerology, symbols, layouts and more. I'd recommend this book for both experienced and beginning readers."
3,Good songs but a few dissapointmentS,"I bought this album because it contained all the songs that I wanted... esp Traveling Man, Lonely Town and Fools Rush in. I knew it was a ""live"" album but hoped that the songs would have some of the sound of the old recording... ahhh well not in my opinion up to the old recording quality. And the enhanced CD thing wouldn''t work on my Pentium 133mhz computer so that was a fizzle too... If I was going to do it again I'd pass on this one and buy the CD of the old recordings even if it ment getting a couple to get all the songs I wanted."
3,Good only if you are truly interested in Forensic,"This was an interesting insight and research into asmall group of serial murders,rapiest and the real sick ones sadistic killings. It gives a great insight into how these people ""tick"" . No particular answer to this problem, just that this author is able to identify the types of murderer or those that may look like suicide. He is a profiler and very good at what he does."
3,The Homicidal MInd,"A detailed analysis of the criminal mind done with care and consideration of the pathologies of the pathological. --PJ Adams, author of Freud's Revenge"
3,Stephen G. Michaud? Roy Hazelwood deserves better,"Roy Hazelwood is w/o peer in the area of sexual sadism, knowing more about this subject than any human in history. He is brilliant in this field. He is fascinating to listen to, also.Unfortunately, Stephen G. Michaud is a mediocre author and it shows in this book.RH should disassociate himself with this author and find one that could actually write.Had he used a decent author, he'd be given 5 stars. RH deserves better than his co-author and I hope he ditches him and finds an actual author when he writes another book.The above is my opinion."
3,Fascinating but disjointed,"If you're expecting a coherent look at sexual predators and law enforcement's efforts to stop them, this isn't the book for you. Though written by two experts in the field, topics range from the MOs of sexual sadists, to revisitations of better known cases, to profiling, to profiling crime scenes.All of the subject matter is fascinating, if not occassionally gruesome, but it is not delivered in a linnear, logical fashion. Hazelwood and Michaud are all over the map giving you a little bit of this, a little taste of that. I would have preferred a single-topic book."
5,Outstanding...and a little terrifying,"Roy Hazelwood is the premier profiler. If ever you considered a career in this field, this book is a MUST read. Afterwards you'll be able to decide if this is the life for you. Very informative and a tad frightening. I personally have read this book three times and also everything else this man has written. Not for the faint of heart."
4,Dark dreams,Great inside look at criminal depravity and those that hunt them.one of my first reads of this type was by John Douglas.Vickie
2,Not too good,Was a predictable story line and I was hoping for more. It wasnt as intense as I would have liked it to be.
2,Buslink 160 GB USB,"I believe this one was a lemon. I was able to download about 15 megabytes of music to it but couldn't review what I had just downloaded; it simply froze and wouldn't accept anymore.I have a Buslink 40 GB bought circa 2001 (not sure of year); back when 40 GB was best you could get for storage. This old one still works perfectly and I have about 20 to 30 GB of information, music, pictures, etc. stored. It simply keeps working and working which made me decide to stay with Buslink.Sent the newly purchased Buslink 160 GB back but had to involve credit card company to get money returned to my account. They were not willing to cooperate and it was their fault the item did not work. I'm a satisfied customer (now) because I have my money back.Again, this one was probably a lemon because my old, old one still works perfectly."
3,Wonderful for such an old epic,"I read Gilgamesh after I read the Iliad and they Oddyssey, and now i see where Homer got most of his ideas. I sat down with the notion that Gilgamesh would be a hard read; that it would take me forever to finish. However, it turns out that the actual epic is only a 100 pages, and version i got was filled with other poems that corresponded with the epic.I thought that this was a wonderful story, and a worthwhile read if you've ever read anything by Homer or even the Bible, because this is the root of it all. The story is sad, erotic and wonderful all at the same time, and i highly recommend it for any age reader."
2,Not workable for all Ethernet cables!,"I bought these in order to terminate a Cat5e Ethernet cable--and then insert the Keystone Jacks into Keystone wall plates. Beware---They DO NOT work with stranded Ethernet cable--and there's nothing in the sales info to tell you this. They **might** work with solid copper core Ethernet--don't know--but they're still very cumbersome as the other reviewer noted. A better solution if you're trying to connect Ethernet to a wall-plate is to use a Keystone ""pass-through"" jack--which has the RJ-45 female socket on both sides of an in-line connector-- which then snaps into the Keystone wall plate. That way you can use cable that's already terminated with the standard RJ-45 plug--and it's literally ""plug and play"" - so much easier and fool-proof!"
2,I found this very difficult to wire,"Maybe it's because I'm old or clumsy. Maybe it's because this connector is poorly designed. It was difficult to route the wires such that each could be connected and next to impossible to get the cover to snap into place.By contrast, I've also tried these (Leviton R06-5G108-00W Cat 5e 8-Wire QuickPort Adaptor Jack, White) and found them much easier to work with."
2,Did not work as expected,"Product did not work as expected. I ended up stripping the wire and soldering them to the jack. Part of this is due to poor quality cable, part due to bad design of the jack."
3,A very thorough taxonomic guide to Trifolium,"This is strictly a taxonomic guide (or key) with history, plant origins, and detailed plant descriptions of all species in the Trifolium genus. It also has many black and white - hand-drawn pictures for identification. This book does NOT include any management information (ie. uses, importance, establishment rates/methods, etc...). A very detailed scientific publication."
5,This Is What The Future Sounds Like,"This album is quite possibly the best example of 1990s post-avant-garde-jazz. It breaks down the boundaries between the orthodoxies of the uptown neo-traditionalists and the downtown free jazzers in a completely un-selfconscious fashion, moving comfortably from funky bass motifs to howls and squeaks to Basie-inflected brass riffs. In fact, sax man Ted Nash plays with Wynton Marsalis _and_ Allison, and Marsalis and Eric Reed have guested with Allison's Jazz Composers Collective. Allison and friends know the tradition inside and out, and they know it includes a spirit of invention and fun."
2,A Bit Bland,This popcorn is a bit bland. It does not taste as good as the popcorn I make in a brown paper bag in the microwave. I am dissappointed.
2,Bad experience with this model...,"I'm hoping that I'm not in for a nightmare experience with my other Maxtor products. I have a relatively new system with two internal Maxtor drives. I attached an older model OneTouch to the system, so that makes three. Then I bought this one to back everything up. I've used it about a half dozen times and now it has failed - the dreaded rapid blue light flash. Support told me the drive has failed and needs to be replaced. Just out of warranty, too. This is the one time I wish I had bought an extended service plan."
2,Problems,"I read a lot of good reviews about this product. When I got it a month ago, I was very excited to see what it could do. I was immediately disappointed as it would not back up my hard drive consistently. I contacted Technical Support by phone and he was very helpful. He sent me an email with instructions of what to do to solve the problem. Let me know that if it doesn't work to email him back. I tried it and it didn't work so I emailed him back and he never responsed. Ultimately, the problem is either the Maxtor hard drive or my Sager laptop's hard drive."
1,Nice idea but not reliable,"I digitized my entire music collection onto one of these drives. I then bought a second one to backup. Good thing I did. At least once every three to four months, 50% or more of the subdirectories on the disk just vanish. I then reformat and copy the files from the backup and the drive works again for a month or two. The strange thing is, iTunes can still find the files, but windows explorer cannot."
5,An Underrated Display of Genius.,"Sadly, as has happenned to many other great games, this game hit the market when it wasn't truly receptive to this manner of a game. Few have been able to truly experience this beautiful title, nonetheless, it has spawned quite a rabid and voluminous fanbase. This game is the Action/Rpg genre at it's best. Be advised to look beyond it's cartoonish graphics because under all that lies a great simple, yet oddly mature, storyline. The puzzles are devilishly well designed and the environments are so engulfing that any one person playing it will surely find it a daunting task to stop playing it. A must buy for any self respecting rpg fan. And a word to the wise, don't even consider the sequel. It was developed by a different team and both the storyline and the feel of the game itself are some of the worst I've ever seen. This is the one game to own if there ever was one!"
4,Gereat Action RPG,"Besides my gaming integrity being slightly scarred by near impossible obstacles, and I use the word ""near"" really loosely, I do have to admit that this game is awesome. If you really enjoyed games like Ys, Zelda, and/or LandStalker, you'll especially dig Alundra."
4,Great game,"This is a great game but, kinda confusing. You'll need the players guide for this game. It looks like the super nintendo graphics but it's still awesome."
5,The right mix of FABULOUS and foreboding...,"If you didn't live through this time, this story may seem to turn from glittery glamour boys and wild party sex to KS and coughing way too quickly. The truth is, in the early 80's this is what the gay community lived with. AIDS was not understood or even recognized as anything other than the way God was punishing sinful behavior. It was quite common to visit a sick friend on your way to the club. I knew many people who would dance away the sadness and fear. This atmosphere of uncertainty was the perfect breeding ground for fast forming relationships that would last lifetimes...however long that may be. This film captures the time period pretty accurately. It WAS fast paced. There WERE people who chose not to deal with it. People DID fall madly in love with eachother despite (or perhaps because of) thier limited life expectancy."
3,"Well done, but...","Well done, but....Well done for showing the horror of dying of AIDS, showing the body falling apart, before the new drugs came into play.Though, In saying that, I could not say this was the best acted film and the story line was, well, weak.The fairy tale was to quick and then AIDS cut it tragically short, making me personaly not belive in the relationship between the two main characters."
3,Depressing,"I read this book just after it won all the awards. I couldn't put it down. That's not entirely a good thing, considering the fact that it was such an incredible downer. Do we really need another piece of entertainment that chronicles the deaths of so many people? Unlike many who have read this work, I didn't find much within its covers that could be considered humorous. I just remember feeling depressed, covered with mud and exploded bubonic plague bubules when it was finished. It's compellingly written, but, when all's said and done, I didn't feel that there was much to be gained by experiencing this work. The characters were not very memorable, either. I must admit, though, that I've never forgotten the author's descriptions of plague victims' symptoms. Yech"
3,Doomsday Book,"Historical accuracy of life in the 14th century was excellent, and the plot started out in an exciting way. But after reading several of Connie Willis' books, I discovered there is nothing very exciting about her time travel concepts. There are too many failsafes like the characters not being able to introduce any anachronisms into the past. Anachronisms are what make time travel interesting, (i.e. read Millenium for an exciting time travel novel). Also, too many rules and restrictions about time travel make this novel's ending fall flatter than a pancake. The final chapters would have been incredibly suspenseful had the character Kivrin perished in the 14th century and been found in the 21st century excavation. Then Dunworthy could have gone back to try to change the past in order to save her. Conclusion: This novel gets your anticipation up to fever pitch then lets you down with a disappointing ending."
1,Arrrgghh!!!,"I read science fiction to be entertained. While I can assume from the great reviews of this book that there is some substance to the material it contains, it was amazingly slow and boring. Obviously there are different ways to review a book besides page-turning entertainment. I am still recovering from a bruised nose from when, during my attempt to get through chapter four, my head suddenly hit the table.Used book, anyone"
1,Over-rated and slow paced,amazon recommended this book but i found it very slow paced and drawn-out. Nothing innovative here. I would suggest something else.
1,Terribly dull.,"I usually browse the Hugo and Nebula award winners looking for a good read, so I picked up this book anxiously. Boy, was I dissapointed. NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS BOOK. Page after page, there is little action, little conflict, little story. All in all, this is a very dull book. The description of medieval life is interesting, but readers should stay away if they think they are going to read a good sci-fi time traveller novel."
3,Badly written but terrific story,"A wonderful story from a mediocre writer. In parts boring and repetitive (very!...okay, we get it, you have run out of toilet roll...) and other parts quite devastating, I would recommend it if you can be bothered to stick with it until its end, which is much better than the first 2/3 of the book. Ms Willis could have done with a better editor; my edition of the book had hardly any full stops (periods) in it. I thought it was a device of the story, but no, just terrible, terrible editing (or lack thereof)."
4,Yay! Non-moronic scifi.,"Connie Willis presents a world that is entirely cohorentand self-consistent. Her mannered study of British lifein the 1300s lives alongside the time travel story which provesthat even the most tried and true scifi tropes can be redone wellin the hands of a capable writer. And that she is. The tensionbuilds with a tempo that will keep you turning the pages eventhough you know roughly how the details all get worked out.However, the dramatic tone does float towards overtly and overlymelodramatic once in a while. It's a small smudge on an otherwisewell paced book that convinces the reader that seriously goodscifi can also be a page turner. It's also just a tad longer thanit deserved, but honestly only by 10%. Also check out To SayNothing of the Dog- a book set in the same Willis universe,but is not a direct sequel. If anything, that may be a betterbook than this one. I read them in backward order, accidentally,and there is no reason you have to read these in order."
5,Doomsday Book- A Travel Through time,"This book deals with time travel to the past. The heroine is the victim of a malfunctioning time machine, which accidently sends her back to a time when the plague was rampant in the communities near Cambridge, England.Her translator also malfunctions at first, causing her to misunderstand the middle English spoken by the natives of the new time(written phonetically for the reader's benefit), but eventually she is able to communicate with them, though she's unable to make much of a difference in their lives.This is a worthy read, to which I return at least once a year(as I do with other fond friends of literature). A good read for a rainy weekend at home!"
3,Not sci fi,"First of all this book is not sci fi. There are a few references to time travel, the ""net"" and paradoxes and that is the extent of the science. If anything it is fantasy and if that is it's raison d'etre it fails. Other reviewers have commented that it is repetitive. This is true and I think it is because the author just didn't have the desire to flesh out the characters in one of the two settings. Come to think of it she didn't flesh out the characters in the other setting either but she did flesh out the settings themselves. Bad choice. It's like she researched the middle ages and wanted to tell us all about it. Really? How about telling the story of the characters in the context of the middle ages. The main problem is though that the story itself is utterly and completely pointless which you will see if you make it to the end. Really disappointing. I can't believe this book won prizes. It really makes me question the validity of these book prizes."
1,Wretched,"Although Brad from Denver has already summed up the problems with this book quite nicely, I can't help but take a few jabs of my own. The concept of ""character development"" completely escapes the author, hence my lack of caring about who died, who is in trouble, etc. Why care? Another problem is the pace of the book. It is, to my knowledge, the slowest book you will ever read. Painfully, remove-your-own-teeth-with-a-screwdriver painful. I tried to bravely make it at least half way, but alas, my mind shut down at one-third. Wretched. This book inexplicably won a prestigious award for science fiction."
4,Refreshing dose of realism in time travel science fiction,"I must admit I was flummoxed to find so many negative reviews of this book. I inhaled it over the course of two days. I was most iimpressed with its storyline in the Middle Ages--what a refreshing reminder that life in the past was not all chivalric knights and fair princesses. The reality involved lots of nasty things like poverty, casual violence, and disease. In addition, I enjoyed the characters in both story lines. Let's hear it for strong female leads! Also, I didn't find the ""future"" storyline as bumbling as many. Rather, it often provided a much-needed breather from the heavier historical fare. All in all, a book worth reading."
5,A haunting book that stains your soul,"This is a very moving book. Yes, some of the characterizations of the modern day characters are sterotypical. Yes, the book starts out rather slow. I had heard these criticisms before I read this book. But don't let them prevent you from reading one of the best reads around. This book is richly detailed with period nuances that make you smell the stink and feel the hardships of medieval England. You will be drawn into this haunting time. This book has made a lasting imact on me. I read it over a year ago, and I still think of the pitifully described people often. I've never written an endorsement for a book, but I had to come back to pitch this. You'll be glad you bought it."
3,Flawed but haunting,"I agree with many of the comments I've read about this book being overlong, the characters (especially the ""modern"" Brits) being largely uninteresting, the sequences in 2054 being boring, etc. etc., but . . . . the description and handling of the plague, the unexpected language difficulties and the scenes in 14th century England somehow were so compelling to make up for the other flaws and make this a definite recommendation. The early scenes where Kristin can't interpret what people are saying (nor they her) was nothing less than chilling. What I can say about this book, unlike most, is that it sticks in your mind for days and weeks afterwards. A truly unique novel."
3,Is This Really Science Fiction ?,"This is an interesting book and the characters are certainly vivid and well portrayed. But in the end, even with time travel, I don't think this is really science fiction. It's a story of people coping with adversity; a deadly virus and the plague. More than anything it portrays life in an English village in the 14th century and vividly describes people getting violently ill. Watch ER instead if that excites you.I'm surprised that it won the Nebula award. A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court has more science in it than this, and is a lot more enjoyable to boot."
4,Good Read!,"This is a great vacation read, very fun, great storytelling. Not just Sci Fi, good characters and emotion."
5,This story will stay with you,"** spoiler alert **A day after reading this and I'm still mourning the death of Father Roche...I thought this book was perfect just like it is. The story starts at the lab where historian Kivrin will travel back in time to the 1320. Her mentor, Mr. Dunworthy, suspects there is something wrong and advises her she should not time travel but of course, she does, and all things break lose both in the past time and present time.There were several things I enjoyed about the book: the fact that there was an epidemic and how they were dealing with it (made me think of '12 Monkeys'), the way all the characters from both past and present were connected, the way the author took you step by step through the ordeal so that it felt like we were really there trying to figure out where/when Kivrin was and how to make sense of things when nothing does.I think the emotions evoked by the story of this book will stay with me for a long time."
2,how did this win the Hugo and Nebula?,"I am plowing my way through all the Hugo award winners right now and after the sublime lterary quality of works such as Ursula K LeGuin's ""The Dispossessed"" and Miller's ""Canticle for Lebowitz"" I am appalled at this choice. The character's are flimsy and the plot, oh dear. Time travel always has it's problems but the solution to avoiding paradoxes here is something a ten year old could have dreamed up. A major portion of the book is spent trying to locate a time traveller in the past, and all the slapstick events that prevent them from doing so. The main character who is claimed as a brilliant student does the most inept job as an historian. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
1,Not your page turner,"I found the book to be, in one word, boring.The plot doesn't move anywhere, sentences and scenario repeat themselves over the same chapter more than once.The thought of going to church (as one of the characters decides to do), takes more than 10 pages to happen, as she contemplates on whether to do it, or not and then again whether to do it or not, and then again whether to do it or not, and then something happens so she thinks it over AGAIN.WowGoing through 60% of the book, and starting to use the next button looking for the ""spoken word"" rather than the thought processes the characters go through makes me wonder if there is even a plot here or just ""day-to-day"" actions taking place here.I would say skip this book."
2,A real tour de farce,"The cover of the book, calls itself a tour de force. I could think of less polite ways of saying it, but the best I can do is tour de farce. The book is simply poorly written. The genre is science fiction. However, to be effective, the story needs to be credible. This is not. A real must miss for any lover of SF."
1,So boring...,"Yeah, yeah. I know many people were amazed by the character-portraiting in this book. I wasn't, but that's not the point. The point is, if you want to write a book you have to think of a story. This book has none, only a ""situation"" that is made clear in the first pages. Read on the next 500 or so pages, but do not expect anything else (oh, yes, except more and more endless repetations of the same ""comic"" conversations taking place in the future - is this the part which is intended to be a comic relief? Jesus!)"
1,An incredibly disappointing read,"I had heard so many good things about this author that after I finally read it I was frankly dumbstruck at how bad I thought this book was. Initially I enjoyed the historical part of the book but there was absolutely no dramatic tension to be found anywhere. It often felt as though I were reading two stories, one in the ""present"" and the other in the past that were related by nothing more than the attempts to bring the girl back. I didn't understand what the point was of the emergency in the present and what it had to with what was happening during the black plague. The whole read was ultimately boring and left me with a rather bad taste in my mouth.I cannot recommend this book and though I may try another of her books this certainly didn't make me want to try one anytime soon.Blech!"
1,Inplausible,"It is 2048, there are time machines. There are no cell phones though.Society is worried about plagues, but they are not worried sending girls back to the 1300s. Alone.The lead of the history department is on vacation, so his deputy takes over, lowers safety standards and sends back a girl to 1320. There is only one technician who can do it and when he gets sick, there is no backup.The sheer contrivance of the plot and the stupidity of the characters boggles the mind. In some years apparently, the most contrived, implausible work must win the Hugo / Nebula it seems. There are several examples, this is one of them."
4,a great story within a bad one.,"If you plan to read the book, don't read this because it will ruin the best parts of the book for you. The sections in the future were awful - boring, tedious and repetitive. Save for Mr. Dunworthy, I didn't care about any of these characters. The sections in the past were spledid. I grew so attached to the characters that the ending was devastating emotionally. Every time the health of a dying character improved, I hoped they would pull through, only to be hurt time after time. The relationship between Kivrin and Roche was beautiful. Their dignty and actions inspiring. If you plan to read the book, skim the bad story so you can experience the great one."
5,Some people actually wrote NEGATIVE reviews of this book?,"I had recently read Connie Willis' ""To Say Nothing of the Dog,"" which I quite enjoyed ... so I decided to read some of her other books. I am glad I did, as ""Doomsday Book"" is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I grew so attached to all the fascinating characters in this tragic story that the tears were pouring out of my eyes by the end. It was completely unlike the lighthearted mystery of ""To Say Nothing ..."" but it was just as compelling. Definitely the sort of book I would want to read over and over and over. Now, if you'll excuse me, I am going to go order it (the copy I have sitting on the desk in front of me was checked out from the library and, tragically, must be returned in a few weeks)."
4,Interesting combination of history and sci-fi,I found this book a quick read - good pace - interesting characterizations. It combines an engrossing story of what life may have been like during the Black Plague with an interesting futuristic element.
5,Moving and realistic,"As a medievalist, I find Willis' depiction of life in the middle ages to be believable. I like the author's approach to the time period. The people are quite different from us...obviously and unapologetically NOT modern. Yet, Willis convincingly links the past and the future in more ways than one. I find her future, with the bureaucratic tangles and incompetence, to be quite believable as well. Additionally, her characters are engaging and realistic. I particularly liked Mr. Dunworthy (and enjoyed his reappearance in other books) and Father Roche. She didn't resort to any of the tired stereotypes of the middle ages. I was particularly glad to see her depiction of genuine piety. Very well done. Highly recommended."
2,Astonishingly miserable SF,"I suppose you might enjoy this book if you like the array of literature you can find in any airport. Poor characterization, lack of any surprises, cliched use of time-travel tech. Read it if you must, but then use this novel as a stepping stone to move into real works of Science Fiction."
2,"Good idea, bad book.","This book won both Nebula and Hugo award. Why, i don't know. 250 pages into the book i started skipping pages... the last 150 pages i skipped completly. It was really paintstaking to wait for them to find out the cause of the disease. A pain. Avoid this one and ready Hyperion instead."
3,"Good, but not great","Facinating concept -- a time-traveling scholar trapped in 14th century England and her 21st century mentor literally race against time to try to prevent her being stranded in time as parallel crises imperil both eras. The characters are well developed and finely etched, and Willis expertly conjures up the world of the Middle Ages. But the book staggers under the weight of unnecessary detail, and the artificial plot devices the author employs to maintain suspense are irritating. Unfortunately, the main character is never convincing as a trained Oxford historian. A brisk read once the Willis hits her stride two thirds of the way through, but it's a slog to get there."
2,Must be approached the right way...,Along about the middle of the book I discovered the right way to approach it... every fifth or sixth page or so pick a paragraph at random and read it until you get to the end of the story..
3,Nothing special,"I bought and read this book a long time ago, whenit first came out on paperback. I rememberdistinctly that I thought it was very flat; Iwas not at all impressed. Guess they're givingawards based upon the amount of research thatgoes into writing a book, not how interesting,engrossing, or compelling it is."
1,Anna Keaney-Dullea said it all...,"How in the world can anyone give this more than two stars? I tried to enjoy this book - I kept looking for that surprise or unique event. The story is ridiculous in so many regards, but for me the most outrageous is the author's painful need to explain EVERY SINGLE DETAIL of EVERY SINGLE MINUTE of the characters' days - like the publisher paid by the word! And as Anna Keaney-Dullea said, some of the details would have been ridiculous years ago, let alone fifty years from now.Also, this book has almost nothing to do with time travel. The story could have been written with one character in Great Britain and another somewhere in Africa.This author can construct coherent sentences. Too bad because there are way too many in this one. I would have edited out 2/3 of this book as meaningless babble.Spend your money elsewhere."
1,Truly awful.,"Maybe I'm too demanding, or maybe too we'll read in the sub genre of postapocalyptic u/dystopias. This book is just utterly poorly written.The author is evidently not a native speaker of British English, yet foolishly makes the mistake of setting this novel in Britain, in a society and a language she barely understands. Is this a public school? A grammar school? Oxford University? All possibilities are mished into one mash within the first ten pages. And no, the British do not go on ""vacation"", not even the faux idiomatic neologism of the author's own devising: ""vac"".Grating, jarring. The writing gets in the way of a story, which I didn't have the patience to discover."
2,style is most frustrating,"I notice that a lot of people really like this book, but I found it very irritating. It takes until page 386 before the author gets to the point. In the meantime she uses and re-uses a couple of really irritating devices: characters constantly repeating factual information, like the symptoms of various diseases or constantly going over their concerns about someone's welfare; or character's about to find out some crucial piece of information but constantly being frustrated by some minor mishap. I get enough of this kind of thing every day at work and don't need to read it time after time in a book. The basic idea of this book is good and the last quarter of it moves along at a reasonably good pace. But it takes a long time to get there and I almost put it down several times."
2,Most overrated book in years,"I cannot understand what people like about thisnovel. I could barely finish it. I kept hoping it would get better or end well. It doesn't.The characters are completely unreal and theyseem to be controlled by ""artificial stupidity."" Whenever there is a simple and obvious thing to do which would probably resolve the wholesituation, theyinstead do something silly to advance the plot.It is also virulently anti-technology. We'resupposed to believe that a bunch of scientistsand engineers have built the equivalent of ahydrogen bomb, or the Death Star, and thenwandered off leaving it for these incompetentsto screw around with however they please.The people who built this machine wouldcertainly have more sense in their little fingersthan the characters of this story all put together"
2,Doomsday is right!,"If you want sci-fi, developed characters AND engrossing storytelling than avoid this book at all costs. Then pick the Hyperion (in this case the Hugo was deserved) series by Dan Simmons, a modern master"
2,"repetition, repetition","Oh dear, I see the point of the negative reviews. A great idea (thus two stars, not one), but done so badly. So much repetition, so little character development, such a slow plodding pace. I'm half way through it. Do I have the patience to finish it?I have read little science fiction, and decided to read this because of recommendations and because it won awards. Is this the best of science fiction? If so, why would I bother to read any more of it?"
2,Like a bad episode of ER,"This book takes us through three waves of illness. One is a bad flu that hits a 21st century university during Christmas break. This wave is poorly written with several running jokes that (1) are not funny and (2) destroy any feeling for the deaths that occur.The other two waves occur in the Middle Ages. We get a lengthy story of the illness of a time travelling student/historian, followed by a separate plague that strikes the other characters.The story of the final plague is moving. Unfortunately, it is only about 100 pages of a 600 page book. And by the time you reach it, you have had an overdose of high fevers, racking pains, and drifting in and out of consciousness.The Hugo and Nebula awards for this book are unfathomable. Affirmative action for female science fiction writers?"
1,"Boring, repetitive, and annoying characters","I started this book with high hopes due to it winning both the Hugo and Nebula. My only conclusion is that was an extremely slow year for science fiction publishing (perhaps Connie waited 5 years to strategically time its release). The characters are very one-dimensional, have annoying pointless conversations, and never seem to end up solving anything. The characters are very one-dimensional, have annoying, pointless conversations, and never seem to end up solving anything. The characters are very one-dimensional, have annoying pointless conversations, and never seem to end up solving anything. And the book is as repetitive as this review.I would recommendA Canticle for Leibowitzas a Hugo winner that I enjoyed much more."
3,Can't recommned it,"The book tells two stories -- one following the adventures of a time-traveling historian who goes back to the 1300's and one following the university staff who run the equipment used to send her back. I found both stories sort of interesting, maybe a little more so in the future part. However, I cannot recommend this to casual readers. it's way too long, with loads of paragraphs and pages telling us tedious details about the family of the medieval characters, and I especially found the child Agnes trying and a lot of ink is wasted on her ""exploits."" Plus, the author wasn't very clever in foreseeing the future. Lots of frustrating time is spent in the 2048 part trying to find a video-phone that isn't overloaded or in use. Seems cell 'phones must die out in that world since no one has one. And they still rely on books to research stuff, so the Internet has also disappeared. A disappointing read considering all the praise it's gotten."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....,"This is what I want to do everytime I pick up this book in an attempt to finish it. I'm currently about 3/4ths of the way through but frankly, everytime I see another book I'd like to read, I put off reading this book again. The majority of the book takes place back in 1348 during the time of the plauge (through time travel) and most of that takes place within the confines of a house in a village. This book just goes nowhere. It is just plain boring. I wanted to like it, especially since another reviewer said it was better than Crichton's ""Timeline."" This book is not even in the same league. This is the only book I've ever started that I may not finish. It's that BAD. Do yourself a favor and read ""Timeline"""
1,VERY disapointed,"I love Time Travel stuff, expected a lot from the reviews. I got up to 300 pages hoping it would get better but I realized I was wasting my time. Dumb characters, little actually happens. Worst of all it's just boring. Stay away."
2,ATMOSPHERE BUT LITTLE STORY,Going against the tide apparently. The spine of the story is extremely thin. The details meant to make you care about the characters were so bereft of interest that I found myself racing over whole pages looking for some scrap of interesting plot progression. A waste of a read.
2,"Plodding, slow and a sleep aid","I'm sure this book is great if I could ever make it through. I finally gave up about 1/3 of the way in. Why does Ms. Willis have to write about every single thought, emotion and insignificant story point that has nothing to do with the plot? I listened to the audio version and many times I just wanted to press a 30 second skip button to get the story moving. Several times I just blurted out ""come on already! how many times is Kivrin going to go through her symptoms to self diagnose her illness?!"". This book is opposite of Crichton's novel Timeline which was fast paced but lacked the historical knowledge and depth that Ms. Willis obviously included. The 14th century was a pivotal century in Western civilization, it would be exciting to find a book that would bring it alive. This book fails at that."
4,"Enjoyable, but could've been more","In all, a good read. The medieval parts, especially, seemed pretty realistic. I enjoyed Kivrin's struggles with Middle English before the translating device finally kicked in. The characters in the 2ist Century were mostly meant to be droll, I know, but I didn't find them all that amusing. Yeah, the ending was sad. Too bad Kivrin's rescuers couldm't have gotten there in time to save one or two of her friends. Actually, for a while I thought Father Roche was going to turn out to be a time traveler, too. The way he prayed was similar to the way Kivrin talked into her 'corder. Moreover, we have to suppose that the art of time travel was pursued and refined way past the 21st Century--in fact, into the indefinite future. So why could Roche not have been a traveller from, say, the 25th Century? It would have made for a more interesting book...."
5,Wonderful.....Is all sci-fi this good?,"I stumbled upon Doomsday Book while browsing through the new release section at a public library. I read it back in 1993. After returning the book, I forgot the name. I have spent countless hours in bookstores and libraries describing the book to the sci-fi gurus in hopes that they could tell me the name. I've even spent many a hours here at Amazon trying to find Doomsday Book. Finally, I checked out Borders.com and found it. Borders has a fantastic search engine.I am not a sci-fi fan. All that techno stuff turns me off. But, I loved this book. The author paints a vivid landscape. What I loved most is the realistic descriptions of characters and living conditions.Can any of you reccommend other novels like Doomsday? I also liked The Alienist and I am looking forward to Lady in the Loch. Please email me with any reccommendations that you may have."
1,Huh?,"I don't really understand how this book has so many 5 star reviews and awards. All the characters in the future seem the same, and it feels like some medical drama with some time travel elements thrown in. I found myself starting to skip paragraphs, then entire pages, hoping something interesting would happen. Disappointment for me."
4,What a great book!,"If you like sci-fi, fantasy and history you'll love this book. I did. The characters are totally engaging and it's fascinating. The only thing that stops it from being a 5 star book is the long parts about Dunworthy, they got a little boring. All the parts that take place in the 14th century are totally excellent."
2,Frustration,"I feel obliged to write this review because of the average rating of 4 stars. The pacing of this book is very slow. I can skip entire sections, and still find the characters mulling on the same questions over and over again.It's a book of frustrations, none of the characters get any where, same questions are asked again, and again, and again, the same action sequences happen again, and again, and again... There are so many scenes of examining gobstoppers so as to induce involuntary snoring (I wonder if it's the same gobstopper! Hmmm...).Two questions really go through the entire book, 1. what time was Kivrin in the past, and 2. what caused the epidemic.Really, if this book is 1/3 of its size, it would be a much better read."
4,If you liked TimeLine...,"Doomsday Book is well researched and well written, with many believable characters and an absorbing plot. The protagonist is both multi-dementional and likable, and the reader finds oneself drawn in to her story.Definitely a ""must read"" if you're into time travel and/or the middle ages, and a gem for Willis fans."
5,Heartbreaking,"This is the first Connie Willis book I've read, but it will not be the last. The family of ""contemps"" and their everyday life is extremely thought provoking. The middle third of the story is generally character development, you get to know the contemps and the modern characters. Sometimes this is tideous to get through, but I assure you it is well worth it. Without this section of the book, it's just another time-travel novel, with this section it becomes a heartbreaking study of how people can endure the most painful of circumstances.While the contemps are the main story, there are still modern characters that ,while not as tragic as the contemps, still capture your heart. This story will capture your heart, it is a wonderful book that should be enjoyed by many."
4,Good...but....,"The story was amazing and it was a fun book to read. Descriptive enough to give a picture of what The Plague must have been like but not so much as to make it laborious. The characters were developed and interesting. The concept of time travel involving historians was alluring.The downside was the predictability and, as I read in another review, the repetitiveness.Overall, a good book."
5,Bought it Again,"I had to read The Doomsday Book for a college class on Science Fiction novels. I was never a science fiction fan, but I found this book to be exceptional. I leant it out to a friend(who selfishly never returned it)and I am buying it again right now. I do not normally buy a book more than once, so this one obviously impressed me. It was well written, placeing me in the future and the past with little questioning on my part."
2,Maisry got a bad rap,I was so excited to read this. I had read that it was one of the top notch books about the Black Death. So many reviews have already covered the details that I am going to keep this short and just say it was a huge disappointment. I think it MIGHT have been salvageable if the whole story was set in the Middle Ages. I need to read an outstanding book now to cleanse my palate.
3,"OK, but slow beginning","I found the pacing frustrating, she slowly moved through material I thought relatively unimportant, and then I thought the ending was rushed."
5,Can't get enough!,"I find myself recommending this book to friends all the time, and yet, I can't stand to part with my well-loved copy, even for a few days. I finally buckled down and bought several extra copies so I could give them away without separation anxiety."
4,Very Dark Novel... but Fascinating,"One thing that distinguishes Connie Willis fromother writers is that she does her homework. Doomsday Book is the culmination of five years of research that Willis did on the time period and the Black Death. The end result is a rather dark novel, but one whose characters are not only sympathetic, but mulit-dimensional and well-developed. This is Willis' forte in her writings, and this book is no exception.This peek into fourteenth-century Europe-- during its darkest times was a little too dark for me, I liked the novel, although personally felt that it was a bit too hopeless for my taste. This is my least favorite Willis novel-- which is not to say that this work is bad-- far from it. In fact, Doomsday Book earned her a Hugo and a Nebula award. It's just not to my tastes."
3,Too long but great ending,I agree with the other reviews saying that the book should be 1/3 of its lengh. It is just VERY SLOW going. I almost put it down never to read it again. The last 150 pages or so is were the action finally happens. I also had a hard time getting past the lack of cell phones in what was supposed to be 2050. One of the main characters spends way too much time trying to track down the head of the college with only wired phones. I know this was written in the early nineties but even back then car phones existed.All in all I would not recommend this book because is it just too long and too slow going. Yes the end is really good but I would not re-read 400 pages to get to it again.
4,A vivid depiction of plague ridden English Village in 1348,"The development of character and place in this story of time travel to plague ridden England in 1348 overcame a plot that sometimes plodded along toward the inevitable conclusion. Willis made the historical characters come alive, so this reader grieved when they black plague killed them so awfully."
5,Couldn't put it down,Great book. The characters are well drawn and the story is enthralling. Could not stop thinking about it.
2,not that good,"A great deal of the book was annoying and felt contrived. After reading other, good works, by Stephenson, Gibson, Simmons, Gene Wolfe, &c, I was quite let down with this one. I can't imagine how it won a Hugo award."
1,"Boring, strained, silly, shallow","I bought this book beaceuse it got the Hugo AND the Nebula. Ever since Harry Potter got the Hugo I do not trust that award at all, but the Nebulas have been all very good. Well, this book is a big disappointment for me. I also read ""To Say Nothing of The Dog"" and this is even worse. The characters are ridicoulous, nothing happens, the plot is agonizingly slow, the plot twists are abvious chapters before they happen and the author just keeps repeating herself over and over again. I do not agree with other reviewers that female sci-fi authors are not good. Try some Le Guin or Nancy Kress, they write the best science fiction out there. But after 2 shots at Mrs Willis I give up."
2,turgid writing -- beware,"There is a great idea buried in a whole bunch of annoying characters many of whom don't do much more than walk around the house waiting for more bad things to happen to them. At the least, Ms. Willis needs to find a better editor."
1,How did this win the Nebula and the Hugo?,"People have been recommending this author to me for years, and I finally picked up her Nebula & Hugo award winning title... and wow, was I disappointed. Read the Amazon editor's sumation and other reviews for the storyline, but here's my complaints:- contrived plot that doesn't explain itself- many 2 dimensional characters that were uneeded, except as comic relief and a way for Ms. Willis to demonstrate her obvious knowledge regarding 14th century EnglandThis book would have been much better with characters who had believable motivations and if the project had a better editor; no matter how long a book takes to be written, any good editor would've chopped well over 100 pages off this."
2,Plodding and repetitive,"This book is far too long. A good idea is wasted by the author's relentless repetition of every detail, and her inexplicable inflation of every tiny plot point (Kivrin is so sick--will she make it to the window seat? Will she make it down the stairs? Will she get back to the manor house?).I lost respect for the Hugo award years ago--this book makes me wonder about the Nebula as well."
2,Dull and repetitive,I have no idea how this book won the Hugo and Nebula awards. The writing is extremely repetitive and the parallel structure of the novel (present + time-travelling past) is obvious an uninteresting.A good idea wasted on poor execution.
2,Big disappointment,"I read this book on the strength of the other reviews, and of the favorable mention that it got in the reviews of The Plague Tales. The whole first half of the book should have been condensed down to one chapter. It's so full of stalling, filler, and just plain stupidity, especially in the future section, that it hardly bears skimming. I was so exhausted by the time I got to the meat of the story that I almost resented spending the time to finish the book. Keep away from this one unless you have a very high tolerance for pointless prose."
2,Sloooowwwww read,"Doomsday Book was very difficult to get into, a really slow read. This book had a depressing story line with no payoff."
2,dry and boring,It's really dry and boring; I cannot see why it's a hugo and nebula award winner. The way the author is trying to create suspense is really frustrating. Please don't waste time on this book.
2,"Too long, often tedious, but still of some interest.","Like others, I found the writing in this book overly repetitive (after being told for about the sixth time, I was pretty much willing to accept that one third to one half of Europe was wiped out by the plague) and sometimes tedious. Something that was particularly annoying was how the characters were constantly coming into and going out of most scenes, especially in the future part of the story. Similarly, the plague and influenza victims all seemed to be on a rollercoaster of getting worse, then gettng better, then getting worse, ad nauseum. It may be an accurate description of the progess of those diseases, but it hardly makes for page turning reading. Anyway, despite this, I stuck with the book and actually liked a couple of characters (Kirvin and Colin). And the historical insights were interesting. Overall, I don't feel I wasted my time, but the story could have been written much better."
2,Minority Opinion; Truly Mundane & Boring,"Other reviewers have pretty well covered the story line so I will jump right to my opinion. I guess I was expecting more ""hard SF"" and this felt more like fantasy; only got half way through and put it down out of pure boredom. It was purchased based on the number of good reviews; should pay more attention to bad reviews."
5,Time-Travel 101,"Connie Willis gives us a ""tour de force"" in ""Doomsday Book."" Willis has not only created intreging characters, but she has also obviously done much detailed research into the world of Plague England. This book is worth reading. Also (if you can find a copy, it's out of print), check out her short-story prequel, ""Fire Watch,"" published in her original collection of short stories, ""Fire Watch.&quot"
2,Repetitious repetition (repetitively),"This should really have been a short story or novella. The entire time I felt like I was reading a school paper whose author was trying to meet some enormous minimum word limit. Everything was repeated ad nauseam. I found myself saying things out loud, like, ""Gee, I wonder what Dunworthy thinks about the 1300s? Oh, here we are: the fourteenth time he grumbled about the Plague and the highwaymen really cemented his opinion for me.""Also, as others have said, the author clearly didn't know what she was doing with the dialog. I lived in England for 7 years--Oxford for 5 of those--and I never heard anyone say they were going on ""vac"" (they go on holiday), or that they saw something on ""the vids"" (referring to television, I assumed). I suppose we could chalk these up to the author's imagined future-slang, but it came off as grating for me. Also, every time the American looked at her ""digital"" I wanted to roll my eyes."
5,A Must Read,"This is not just a good book; it's a great book. I'm sure that in times to come this will be hailed as a classic such as War and Peace and Moby Dick. Connie Willis's portrayal of what life was like in the Medieval Era is realistic and detailed. Her heroine, the time traveling Kivrin is one of the best portrayal of a brave, resourceful but ordinary woman in a calamitous circumstances. If you never read another novel, you must read this one."
1,"Horrible, horrible book","I will never again use the Hugo or Nebula awards for reading recommendations.As has been said by many reviewers, pages of pages of silly miscommunications and characters continually passing out mere moments too early made it an utterly miserable experience.Yet, many, many liked it. I am fascinated by this."
4,Mixed Feelings about this novel,"The story is dragging on the same event for too long, and there is really nothing happened. I also found the present day part of the story dull and uninteresting. I really have to stop myself from skipping those parts and go on reading about the Middle Ages part. That's why I only give it 4 stars.What I really like about this novel is the interactions between Kirvin and the people in Middle Age. The emotion is so real and believable. When it gets to the end with all the bad things happening, the horror, sadness, desperation are so powerful and vivid that it feels like I am right there in the book. I have this heavy, and depressed feeling when I finished the book, and I know it had imprinted a deep impression into my mind.If you are into action/adventure type, this really isn't the book for you. The plots move on at slooow slooow pace. You may not even be able to finish the first 100 pages."
3,"Not the best, not the worst","Not sure why this book was so highly rated. It was OK, but I won't be telling my friends to read it."
3,Good,"I love Blackout/All Clear. Doomsday was not as good as that series, but gets wonderful towards the end. I have read a few of the other reviews that it could have been a bit shorter, and I agree. Willis is definitely a detail-oriented author. It might not have been the same story however, had she left out all the small things. I love her writing style and am ready to get started on another of her books."
4,"Awesome, intriguing, fun","Just to keep it real, I had a hard time reading this when I started it back in June, but finishing it around Christmas time made it much easier to read, b/c that's the season/timeframe this novel takes place in. The book is divided into three major parts (booklets?), the first being the most tiresome, and the third being the hardest to put down. My impression of the main character Kivrin is a strong and brilliant heroine. A fun time traveling adventure, with frustrating battles with bureaucracy, and other challenges. A good read."
5,Cross-Over Story Appeals Beyond Sci-Fi,"The Doomsday Book was suggested to me for the historical merits of its story line, and I was not in the least disappointed. Having spent the past 4 years researching and writing a travel guide to medieval London, I found the history to be accurate, and the characters both authentic and compelling. I have never been a sci-fi fan--in fact have made it a point to not include it on my reading list. Connie Willis just might make me change my mind!"
3,not much point,"Parallelism is supposed to have some sort of resolution, otherwise, there's no point in setting up such a structure in the first place. Okay, there's a deadly disease in each timeline, as well as a crusading hero. What is the mysterious connection between the two events? Nothing.Read ""Changing Places"" by David Lodge if you want to see parallelism with a purpose.And did anyone else get tired of the word ""Cutthroat?"""
2,An astonishingly miserable book.,"I, too, picked this up on the basis of its Hugo and Nebula. What a mistake! Hands down the worst ""science fiction"" book I've ever read. Boring characters, none of whom are noble, evil, or in any way interesting. Nothing happens (other than unrelenting misery and pointless suffering). Zero character development; Kivrin has zero impact on the ""contemps""; EVERYBODY dies; need I go on? Oh yeah: Wills doesn't even have the decency to punish the moron Gilchrist or whatever his name was...she lets him die peacefully offstage, never getting his comeuppance! An astonishingly miserable book. Run, do not walk, away from it."
4,Great for medievalists; junk for science fiction junkies...,"While tha characterization of this novel is admittedlyrather flat, the universal viewpoint is facinating.The main fault of this novel is the great chasm betweenMedieval England and some England-of-the-future. Willis'sacknowledgement that modern historical re-creation carriessome great misconceptions generates food for thought,incorporation of Arthurian characterization (Gwayneand Gringolet) provides interpretive challenge, andthe consideration of the chasm between modern and medievalperceptions of childhood all challenge the reader tofurther thought. Overall, this is a very good read.The low ratings of some critics must lie in the worksfailure as Science Fiction because it is compellingfor the literary historian."
5,I couldn't put it down!!!!,"I have come late to Ms. Willis, and feel as if I should be mad that no one told me about her sooner. I noticed in the book, Book Lust, the author said it was one of the best time travel books she had ever read. So, I remembered I had it in the back of a closet, bought long ago and never read, pulled it out ,and I just finished reading it in two days. What a great book. I won't go into the plot, everyone else that has done that has explained it quite well. I just want to tell you to READ THIS BOOK!!! I could not put it down, but now that it is done, I am off to read another of Ms. Willis's books."
3,Interesting But Ultimately Unbelievable,"An interesting premise, but I don't think that time-travel would be so unregulated as it was portrayed in the book. Also, the book was a bit of a downer. I understand that its focus is on the protagonist and how she ""grows"" during the story arc, but it was really depressing to wade through it."
