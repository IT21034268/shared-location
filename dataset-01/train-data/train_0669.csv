3,Count your Pods!,"These come in a generic white box with no commercial packaging so no assurance of how old they are. The product says 40 pods and box appeared full, but they only included 36. Not sure if this intentional but make sure you get what you pay for."
4,Decent pods at a good price,"Chose these pods mainly on price; I was looking for a ""name-brand"" coffee that wouldn't break the bank. They're pretty good, but not as good as Illy or Starbucks. I'll probably try a few other brands before settling on one in particular."
3,inconsistent coffee for a pod,I was dissappointed with the consistency of shots with these pods. Some of them are excellent while others are awful and watery. I think the packaging is very inconsistent. I would anyday use the starbucks pods- they are way more consistent
1,Love the coffee not the seller,"Lavazza espresso pods are by far my favorite. They are strong, make a delicious crema, and they are smoother than many of the other brands. However, I suggest that you do NOT buy your espresso pods from this retailer (trade concepts). I've bought Lavazza many times, and the product and quality has always been excellent. However, when I purchased this product from Trade Concepts, I received the worst espresso I have ever tasted. I have to use three pods to create the strength usually found in a single pod, there is no crema at all, and it tasted completely different than previous Lavazza products."
5,Smooth,Good espresso! Makes great Latte's with no problems. I will be trying other flavors! Hope they make coffee syrups. Thanks!
4,Tasty and Easy,"Bought for use with a Krups machine. These are far easier to use than packing coffee each day. At $0.50 each, they taste just as good as the $2.00 premium pods."
2,Did not work,"After several times trying to make espresso with poda, i gave up. Everytime it would come very .i followed the directions to the letter. So i am now making espresso directly with g round coffee"
5,The amazing life of Sor Juana,"This book by the Nobel Prize winner Octavio Paz is a great account of the life of one of the best writers of Hispanic literature. Sor Juana created astonishing poems about life, love, and people. It is a pity that only little is known about the facts of her life. As with Shakespeare, must of what we know about her comes from her literary legacy. Octavio Paz is able to solve some of the mystery that surrounds Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz."
5,Little Treasure,I purchased this book for a Christmas gift for my oldest brother. He absolutely loved it!!! The graphics in the book brought back so many memories. When I get some extra cash I'm going to purchase a copy of this book for myself. As we where sitting there pointing out decks from our past I commented on how I couldn't find my first skateboard deck in the book (which it was in there). I mentioned that I wished I knew what happened to that board. My brother laughed stood up left the room and came back with my board. He kept the board all these years and now I have it back. It was scratched and mangled with memories but now I have it hanging on my wall. Great book!
5,Boner City!!,"I was a big fan of the first Disposable book and this one is just as good if not better . If you are into this kinda stuff then this book is a must. I got it about an hour ago and have gone through it three times already. Well played Mr. Cliver, well played."
3,Wagner BD125286,This part fit and is good quality. I purchased this part with ceramic pads and have no brake noise.
4,The French Revolution/Horizon Caravel,"The French Revolution is one of many volumes in the Horizon Caravel series of books. This series is a survey of key events and people in world history and is ideal for middle and high school students. This volume is an overview of the causes, events, people, and effects of one of the most important events in both world and French history. Topics covered include the storming of the Bastille, King Louis XVI's attempt to flee France and his subsequent trial and execution, the battles of Valmy and Neerwinden, the Reign of Terror, the emergence of Napoleon, and the results of the French Revolution. The book also provides brief profiles of King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, the Marquis de Lafayette, Maximilien Robespierre, and other key people. The book is illustrated with numerous paintings, drawings, and documents of the period. In sum, The French Revolution is a concise yet informative introduction to one of the most significant events in world history."
2,The Author w/ His Mind in the Gutter by the Side of the Road,"Kirsch goes out of his way to make secular religion look bad in this dose of hard corps revisionism. Still, this is well worth reading if you ever pondered some of the more troublesome stories of the Old Testament. How come ma' preacher never told me this stuff?! I'd have come to church EVERY sunday!"
5,"Harlot; Honest, interesting insight into the ""hidden"" bible","Harlot by The Side of the Road was not only an interesting read that kept my attention throughout, it was a refreshing viewpoint which challeneged religious boundaries and censorship. The book focused on stories from the bible, well researched and explicated, which are not usually included in biblical texts. Kirsch has taken taboo subjects and explored them as part of human nature. I found that Kirsch retained a great sense of respect for ancient texts while trying to keep such sensitive subjects open to speculation and exploration. This was a great book and I highly recommend it."
5,Excellent introduction to biblical scholarship,"This is a fun way to get into biblical scholarship. The author starts with Biblical stories that can be hard for us to understand because they seem very immoral and strange (Why did Lot offer his daughters to the men outside his door? Why did Tamar want to seduce her father-in-law? What was the night attack on Moses?). He then provides some history and understanding of the era and what may be behind the writing. I came away from this book thinking of how much richer the Bible is than I had ever imagined! For example, two stories may have been combined by an editor. Or the author may have had a personal axe to grind(attacking the Benjaminites in another story). Or the translator may have mistranslated some of the words. It helped me to see what a fascinating subject this is---combining history, language, customs and a lot of detective work!"
4,Lovely little book,"While I may not agree with all of Kirsch's interpretations, I think this was a generally good book. I found the glossary and study guide were especially helpful. ""Harlot..."" inspired me to look deeper into the Bible's many levels of meaning. After reading the book, I realized what connotations may lay behind many calls for a return to ""biblical era ethics and morals."" Kudos to Kirsch for providing new and different points of view on the ancient text."
2,"Very interesting subject, writing style is hard to read...","I enjoyed the stories in this book, the 'intriguing, sin-filled' stories that permeate the Bible. Kirsch makes some excellent points throughout the text but his writing style is most difficult to read. He writes like a disinterested scholar rather than an impassioned explorer of the world's most divisive, powerful, and glorious book. I was disappointed in the writing but not the subject."
5,An eye-opening journey through faith and doubt.,"Respectful yet challenging, ""The Harlot by the Side of the Road"" is a riviting read and a crash-course in the history of the Hebrew Bible. Kirsh tackles head-on the Bible stories most scholars sweep under the rug, and instead, singles them out for spotlight attention. He examines how and why such incongruous, even irreligious seeming stories could be part of the Bible by analyzing what message they were meant to convey, and in what cultural context they would have originally been understood. Fascinating stuff! I've given copies to a number of friends, some religious, some not, and all have agreed it's not only enlightening, but a page-turner as well!"
4,fasinating biblical commentary,"This book did a wonderful job of adding to my understanding of what is actually being said in the bible. His technique is to tell an expanded version of each story alongside a traditional translation then comment on the passages. The comments will talk about what in the language justifies his version, how the story has been interpreted at various times and what meaning can be taken from the story. The commentary is the most interesting part since it expands on nuances and background information that I can not get from the straight text. I wish that he had talked about more than the sensationalist stories."
3,"Good approach, choppy writing","His spin on events are considered heresy by many. I would say he just exposes the human (darker) side of the people living in the biblical times. A side no one wishes to see in the open, yet everyone gets fascinated by it, sort of like washing undergarments in public. I for one am glad he does not shy away from the darker side of humanity saintified, and considered untouchable... Though I wish the stories in the holly Bible were not the only ones exposed, and referenced to modern times and morals. The world has other religions in dire need of dissection, exposure, and yes ridicule if need be to open the eyes and minds set to follow rules carved in to a stone 2000 years a go. Such as child marriage (at 9 for a girl) would be rape today in modern western countries, but acceptable by most eastern countries as well as Africa in TODAYS times, because their holly book written centuries a go tells them so."
2,"bland, plain, overpriced, disappointing...","I ordered this as a gift for someone and was excited when i had found it because the person it was purchased for is a HUGE bls fan. I must admit i feel like i wasted my money and i'm not sure if i should give it. there is not really a good description of this item so i must admit i didnt know what i was getting. it seems, to me at least, very cheaply made (and i think it shows)and way oversized. not worth more than a few bucks in my opinion, im just totally disapointed with this item and wish i could get my money back to spend on something better/more worth while for the intended recipient. i think i will only buy from amazon (the actual seller)from now on since they seem more reasonable with their pricing and give descriptions of the items they are selling...bottome line...RIP OFF!!!"
4,YOU TALKIN TO ME,Taxi DriverPlot: Viet Nam vet Travis Bickle drives a cab in NYC and is slowly driven mad byurban decay.Review: Believe it or not this is the first time I am seeing this movie. I heard the rumorsabout how good it is so I got the DVD to find out. The movie starts out slow but slowlygains steam. As we get to know the main character it builds up to a violent climaxwell worth the wait. So you will either like it or hate it because of the violent naturebut you will not soon forget it.4 stars for the movie 4 and1/2 stars for the DVD content.
5,DeNiro's finest performance!!,"I can go back to all the performances Robert DeNiro has made over the years, but I can honestly say that this was the best movie he ever worked in. Yes, DeNiro as Jake Lamotta in ""Raging Bull"" was his shinning path to greatness, his portrayal of Travis Bickle was one that still leaves me with such chills. Taxi Driver was one of Martin Scorsese's best movies."
5,"An influential, disturbing masterpiece.","De Niro's infamous ""Are you talking to me?"" is Taxi Driver's calling card, but it is also a fascinating commentary on society, our heroes, and the nature of celebrity. De Niro's performance as the misguided Travis Bickle is one of his best, and Paul Scrader's brilliant screenplay is expertly directed by Scorsese. Travis has been cheated by the American Dream he believes in so feverishly. He tries to grab his little paradise, but simply lacks the tools to reach it. Travis is a tragic figure. He just wants to be like everybody else, but he's not. His rage eventually takes him and the viewer to places he did not expect."
5,Fast Shipping - Great Prices!,"I ordered this DVD and rec'd it within 72 hours - affordable prices too! If I were to order DVD's again, it would be through this vendor."
2,not bad,We already have a Hindi Movie of the same name and content. Try your luck with a a different name and content.
2,Jodie Foster is One of the Two Stars,"When it was new, I didn't go see it because I was told it was pretty violent. Then when Hinkley did his thing ""to impress Jodi Foster,"" I was even more turned off. I had seen some still photos of Foster in her baby whore costume, and admit to having been a bit curious as to what really was involved and how she handled it. That one star up there is for her.It's violent, it's depressing, and in the end, it's pretty incomprehensible. I'm still trying to figure the point of the story. If any of you remember it and liked it, feel free to explain it to me."
2,classic tag hides amoral and poor film,"This film is manipulative and exploitative. It DOES NOT really give you a portrait of what alienation, paranoia and dislocation are really like. It glamourises these things in the worst possible way ie very, very slickly and with a lot of craft and attention to detail. This film belongs in the same dustbin as similarly AMORAL and empty films like Seven, Goodfellas et al that purport to be 'truthful' investigations of the dark and disturbing - they are part of the problem, not the solution !"
1,Bad Packaging,"I am giving this movie a single star without having seen it first. I am trying to get your attention. The packaging is more like a book with inserts of photos from the movie, about 10 or more. It is not standard Blu-Ray packing, and does not blend in with the rest of my collection. I don't like that. I'm sure it's a good movie though. Remeember, it was because of this movie that President Reagan was shot..."
4,Excellent Film,"This film is incredible. DeNiro gives an outstanding performance and the supporting actors do very well. The cinematography is great, and it really enhances the feel of the movie. Worth watching by anyone who wants to see a well-thought, well-planned, phenomenal movie."
5,Psychological roller coaster,"This is the most gut-wrenching, tantalizing, well-acted movie of all time, watch and watch it again!!!"
5,Taxi Driver,"Taxi Driver is a psychological trip through an extremely interesting character study. Leaving viewers mystified, Martin Scorsese has crafted a superb movie. The script is audacious, the cinematography is in your face and gritty, and Robert De Niro's holds up the movie on his very own.Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a taxi driving nobody who has served in a Vietnam and goes to pornographic movie theaters, making small talk with the woman who sells the food and candy. The story never let's go off you (even the end will leave you haunted and wondering) and the lonesomeness of New York seen through Bickle is mesmerizing. It is filmed in such a way that allows you to see the world has the main character would, who thinks New York is covered with ""trash"". Travis Bickle also narrates the story, making it emotional and more than just a one-dimensioned story.No one could have made this movie except Scorsese. Everything you would expect, the camera angles, settings and cast are done perfectly."
5,Great classic movie!!,Amazon has never let me down. I received this dvd in perfect condition and in a timely manner. Thanks.
5,Excelente,"Muy buena pelicula, la recomiendo, buenas actuaciones, y el 2do CD tambien tiene subtitulos en espanol, me gusto mucho, saludos"
4,"""ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?""",Martin Scorsese's (Robert deNiro) grimy look at life on the raw side as seen through the eyes of the dysfunctional taxi driver.A masterpeace.Sharply written the film is credible to the end.
5,A CLASSIC,I have heard this film as one of those films alot of people watch over and over or to just watch in awe the acting and directing that takes place on film. A good movie for any dvd collector!
5,"Okay, um...shut up, Leonard Maltin.","...Shut up, Leonard Maltin. Taxi Driver is a really great movie and one of the many reason's why the 70's was such a jolly ole time for the flicks. It's a movie about a Vietnam vet named Travis Bickle who drives around Manhattan in his taxi cab. It's more like a first-person view of the disgusting and morbid city streets late at night. Travis was considered by some to be a psychopath, to me, he was a hero. He had reasons to kill people, especially Sport the Pimp (who would not let Jodie Foster go for anything). Maybe the attempt on Charles Palentine (the presidential candidate) was a bit over-doing it, but the man had honorable intentions. The best part of the movie was when he was testing his guns out. It kept a smile on my face cause it was so cool, especially when he attached that one gun to his wrist. Overall, it's a cinematic masterpiece that's just as important to film as The Godfather, Citizen Kane, etc. As far as Mr. Maltin goes, don't listen to him."
2,SICK!,"jinxed cabbie gets worst fares. killers, who**s, etc. thwarted by his fantasy play-sex-toy, he cooly decides to kill her candidate....and some pimps too. very high marks for emotion and cinema, deadly low on plot...no surprises. a strange child porn/child exploitation theme wanders through this film, leaving one feel empty....useless. the ending and coda seem to support all the wrong things. hmmn. a little editing would've made this film twice as good."
5,Taxi Driver,An absolutely excellent film and a tribute to both De Niro and Scorsese. A must for every DVD collection.
3,I guess I just expected too much...,"First let me say that this is a good movie. Good, not great. I am a big Deniro fan, so I thought I should check this movie out. Its kind of like SCARFACE in the way that everybody says you HAVE to see it. So I was expecting a lot more than I got. Its a pretty good movie all the way up until the ridiculous ending. The blood looks like ketchup! I can't help but compare it to SCARFACE which had more blood and gore, but was believable. The ending of this movie just wasn't good enough for me. The acting was good all around. I almost didn't recognize Jodi Foster as the young prostitute. My point is that even if a movie sucks the ending can still save it, but this movie was good until the ending which really annoys me. Anyway, if you are a Deniro fan, then I guess you should check it out."
2,Not as Good as I was expecting.,"I had heard for a long time that this was a good movie. So I orderded it from amazon. Now I only wish I hadn't. The first few times I tried to watch it I ended up having to turn it off and go to bed. Note: I am not someone who falls asleep at movies easily!! This movie is just so boring!!! And there really isn't much of a story line to it. It's just stupid. It has a weird ending too, where your kinda like ok what just happened? It's a waste of time. Don't see it!!!"
2,.,"Overrated. The concept is interesting, and De Niro is great in his role. But this film just doesn't particularly inspire anything, at least not in me. It's an interesting character study, I suppose, and I'll give it some credit as such, but the further into the movie I got, the more I speculated on whether there weren't a number of far more rewarding films I could be spending time with in its place. The story just isn't very interesting, and the end ... is flat-out silly. Travis Bickle would've been put to death, not heralded as some kind of hero. For all the gritty ""realism,"" of the movie, this is a pretty major plot-hole to overlook. Eh."
2,A landmark achievement in confused boredom.,"When exposed to crummy filmaking, one's reaction can often reveal a treasure trove of information about that person. Take for example the great ""critic"" boydjt ""Ah-got-mah-hand-gre-nade"" reaction to this acknowledged garbage. Talk about missing the boat! A person can't always help being pedestrian nor having less than adequate intelligence, but what that person can do is not open his mouth and expose himself for the imbecile he truly is. Lesson learned for Mr.FT.Bragg. Gives new meaning to ""pack my chute."" haw hawOne of the most overated movies of all the time."
2,"Taxi Driver (Little Violence, But a Depiction of Insanity)","Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a porno-loving, taxi driving, pie eating, Vietnam veteran that is slowly revealed to be completely out of his mind.I will try my best to review the movie without giving much plot away.De Niro seems to be fairly sane at the beginning of this movie, but slowly (and I do mean slowly) his sanity gives way. Apparently he cannot stand the lack of morality and sleaze that he incounters every night, and eventually he snaps.I personally did not care for this movie, but to each his own.On a scale of 1 to 10Violence-2/10(There is some, but it falls short of the build up the movie creates)Musical Score-0/10(Absolutly Dreadful ragtime/blues/jazz soundtrack!)Acting-6/10(De Niro was good, but other acting was forced:ie. 13-year-old Jodie Foster acting like a prostitute was lacking)Story-5/10Overall-3.5/10"
1,What?,"I really tried hard to like this one because I enjoy Scorcesse. But this film was just complete utter trash. I was never so revolted . Or maybe that was the point? In any case, you'd be better off watching a train wreck."
5,"""rain will come and wash all the scum off the streets""","Short and Sweet, DeNiro, Scorsese, Foster, Kietel, Sheppard and others are brought together to mak the best character study ever, it is slow but intriguing and superbly directed, it captures the characteristics of madness and sleaze and you can relate to Travis Bickle (DeNiro) in every way, even though he is a raging lunatic who his quite contempt to blowing a few pimp's heads off. It is superbly performed and pulled of and that is why it deserves its five stars and recognition."
3,Took a Ride with the Taxi Driver,During the 70's most of us were just trying to get into something. Taxi Driver gave us the deep hole side of something gotten into. Realizing that perfectionism was an ideal and not necessarily a icon to live by. Robert Deniro demonstrated a surreal exploration into the minds ability to take you where you really want to go. We see a sdubtle begining and the effects of lost efforts and misguided youth turning into the last chance at saving if not one own soul than atleast a soul that is considered worth saving.In these times we reflect more on not taking advantage of youth. Yet youth begins it's advantage of the moment and forgiveness for innocence. There a many Taxi Drivers in todays youth. But the real vocus is not the redemtion but the brutality of the event and then the redemption
4,Taxi Driver,"Taxi Driver dramatizes the all too human condition of loneliness, a human being who moves through maddening crowd, jostled, brushed, ignored, abused, hassle, provoked but who is somehow utterly untouched by any of it because of his secret world of fantasy and his inability to communicate with his fellow humans. In short a lonely man, aching to be noticed, recognized and loved, but unable to attain it."
4,Interesting character study and 1970s social commentary,"I saw this film for the first time this passed weekend. Having only seen DeNiro in recent movies it was startling to see his appearance when he was in his 20s. The same for Sybil Sheppard and an even younger Jodie Foster. The story of DeNiro's/Travis Bickle's descent into insanity and the illogical redemption by society doesn't quite ring true. Nevertheless, the story is quite compelling albeit discomforting because one can relate to Travis' lovelessness and frustration with society. Well worth seeing but bring a strong stomach for the violence at the end."
3,A disturbed young man.,"I can see why people love this movie and why others hate it. Taxi Driver is a mixed bag for me, parts of the film I find interesting but there are some slow and boring sections for me as well. Robert De Niro is a fantastic actor, this is his defining role. Jodie Foster is also good as well, she plays a young streetwalker and De Niro's character tries to save her from a life on filth and suffering. The ending is pretty good but I still unsatisfied with the whole film, it's an unique flick but not a classic, I prefer Raging Bull instead."
2,isnt that great......,"i saw this for the first time the other day on cinemax...i had heard plenty of great things about it so i was expecting to see a phenominal movie...all i saw was a pretty decent look into one lonely mans life....but it wasnt really that great to me...it was a little slow....but seeing travis' slow decent into depression was pretty interesting, yet i dont think its a classic...BUT THATS JUST MY OPINION......."
2,"De Niro is the BEST, however..","While the film's end makes you think, some may conceive Travis Bickle (De Niro's character) as more of a hero. He is supposed to be the psychopathic lonely man, not the vigilante. While Scorsese and Paul Schrader give us a fascinating study into the descent of madness, the film moves too slowly at times (Don't get me wrong. Attention to detail is everything; I just think it could have stayed a bit more focused on the storyline itself, because the storyline is interesting). De Niro did a fine job, but all in all, the controversial ending wasn't good. :("
3,Where is the masterpiece?,"I'm in the middle of those who say it is terrible and those who say it is a masterpiece. Certainly, 25 years of movies and (I assume) imitation can make it seem less of an impact film. But it is very slow. It has only one dramatic moment (the climax). The character is inexplicable many times. The script is so minimal that I sometimes wanted to yell- ""say your line already!!""Of course DeNiro is good but I don't see the part as one of his most demanding.But Cybil Shepard is drop dead gorgeous!! Her eyes are worth the rental fee alone!"
1,Terribly overrated,"Bad acting, lame story and very poor execution. It could have been good if carried out right but it moves too slowly. The dialogue doesn't make much sense and it's like Martin was just killing film time by having the actors talk slowly so they had less to write. Nothing brilliant about this film, 1/5"
1,Huh? Who? How? What Happened?,"This movie could have gone down in history as one of the all-time greats. Up until the last 30 seconds, I was eagerly awaiting the end of this great film when BAM! It ended! Just like that! What Happened! He adjusted his mirror? What does this mean? I am rather good at deciphering the meanings of films (check out my review of Brazil) but this one has me stumped. The reason I give it one star is because I feel that a lackluster ending is inexcusable. If someone e-mails me the meaning, I'll be glad to change my review. But until then the rating stands!"
1,Taxi Driver,"I am not sure what people see in this movie. Frankly, it was boring and poorly thought out. The ending was absurd. Ironically, I rented it (2001) because a reviewer of ""Straw Dogs"" recomended it having given very poor marks to ""Straw Dogs"". Each to his own I suppose; I was riveted by ""Staw Dogs""."
1,Boring,"My wife and I found this video to be very boring because there was no plot, poor dialogue, and even the score was monotonous. We viewed it in Sept, 2001, which is 25 years after the movie release. Maybe when it was released it had something to say but it does not hold up to time. Great movies have great dialogue."
4,Flawed Masterpiece,"This is a must-see for any serious movie fan. Robert De Niro is spectacular as troubled loner Travis Bickle. We watch his sense of alienation grow as he descends into a kind of heroic madness. He's that rare evil character that you actually find yourself rooting for, never mind that he's turned into a deranged sociopath.Why not 5 stars? There's some ridiculous editing in this film. A lot of it is in the climactic shoot out. Matthew, the scumbag pimp, takes a a bullet in the gut and returns several minutes later as fresh as a daisy wielding a .44 magnum and firing at De Niro. There are some strange continuity issues as De Niro climbs the stairs surrounded by his rivals. You kind of have to see it to understand.Also, there's the famous final scene when Travis emerges as a hero. It's likely that the dying Bickle fantasizes this whole scene, but that's never made clear to the audience. That confusion at the end is enough to eradicate a star in an otherwise brilliant movie."
2,"""Taxi Driver"" has a good PQ in Blu-ray??? NO WAY !!!","I rent yesterday here in Brasil the Blu-ray ""Taxi Driver"". A lot of shots has a good PQ but there is a LOT of shots that the PQ is BAD !!! In Highdef Digest the reviwer gave 5 stars for PQ ... I can't understand ! I have a Infocus 1080p and old movies in BD like ""2001"", ""The Shining"" and others looks GREAT !!!""Taxi Driver"" is a deception ... Sometimes looks like a so so DVD !!!"
1,Do I have to give it a star!,"I have seen a lot of movies, some good and some bad, but I have never seen one as over rated as this one. I wish someone would tell me why it is good. It is absolutely stupid. The script, story line, the entire movie is all bad!!!! If you value your sanity, don't watch it."
1,"Horrible, horrible movie.","If I could I will not giving any star, it's an horrible movie. Robert Deniro is terrible in it, he gets on my nerves, Cybil Shepard is annoying, only Jodie Foster seem fresh and interesting but we don't saw her much. To much violence for nothing and awful cheezy music. It was soooo boring."
1,A very bad movie,I think that DeNiro should spend some of his money buying acting lessons. This was a waste of my time.
1,Purely Historical Value,"Apparently a film classic about a Vietnam veteran who becomes a taxi driver and then lets himself be broken down by the misery and the meaninglessness of modern society.Seen with Year 2000 eyes, Taxi Driver does not have a great deal of appeal. It has purely historical value.The best things you can say about this film is the very beautiful filming, plus that it is interesting to watch very young Robert DeNiro's and even younger Jodie Foster's already then great talents. You also get glimpses of Harvey Keitel.Do watch Taxi Driver, 'cause it is one of those classics that you have to have seen. But don't expect too much."
5,What's Moonlighting?,"You already know that this is a classic film. What makes the DVD worth owning is the fascinating making-of documentary that accompanies it.Schraeder, Scorcese, De Niro, Foster, Brooks, and Keitel all share their memories of the film's inception, production, and reception upon release. Their insights and recollections are actually worth hearing, and the documentary as a whole makes you wonder why most other DVDs have such useless extras."
5,Still Gritty...after all these years.,I've seen this film many times over the years and I'm always stunned by the final shoot-out. Very Dark.A truely brilliant comentary on the under-belly of society through the eyes of the under-belly of society.One of my All Time Favorite Films!
5,the best psychological film from that time.,"Some people claim that this movie is specifically about angst and the the loneliness one feels when you reach middle age. I DISAGREE however. This movie is actually based on several pyschological factors that involve ""becoming"". Maybe another psychology major might read this and think. Yeah. It's a great movie. check it out."
5,Ain't nobody else in here,"This is a brilliant film with, in my humble opinion De Niros best performance ever. He plays the original loner who prophesises that one day a ""real rain will come"" to N.Y and wash the ""filth"" from the streets. As he's an insomniac he gets a job as a Taxi Driver working late nights in the worst parts of town. he sees things that anger him and throughout the film he is drifting further and further away from reality. He forms an unsteady relationship with a beautiful woman named Betsy. And meets a teen prostitute (Foster) whom he is intent on rescuing from her controlling pimp (Keitel). Oh and he takes a slight interest in guns somewhere along the way. A brilliant film from a brilliant collaboration."
5,Boss,So good. Must watch film. De Niro is perfect. Amazing final scene. Believe everything you hear about this movie and watch it right now.
5,Great product shipped poorly!,"Taxi Driver is one of the greatest, and most disturbing, American produced movies ever! Scorsese's perfect pairing of DeNiro and Keitel go from close friends on the Mean Streets to hated enemies in Taxi Driver! I was excited to have a chance to order this 2 disc collector's edition at a very reasonable price! However, it was shipped in only a very thin plastic wrap and arrived with one corner damaged. Plus the bonus disc was loose and a little scratched. These types of shipments should always be packaged in a bubble lined envelope."
5,Maynard still swinging after all these years!!,"""These Cats Can Swing"" is vintage Maynard at his best! For such a small band this group produces a sound that most larger groups dream of. Although all seven tracks are good, you have to check out their interpretation of Duke Ellington's ""Caravan"". Also two tracks include vocals!!. What makes this CD even better is that, while Maynard demonstrates he can still hit the high notes, he doesn't rely on them to drive the music. GREAT STUFF!!!"
3,Maddox's review,"This toy is fairly fun,however it is not very educational. It is very durable,and pretty good overall. It just has a problem of the wheels getting stuck in the wheelwells."
5,FERGUSON STILL IN CONTROL,"One More Trip to Birdland is a return to great energitic big band style music. This is by far one of the strongest big bands I have heard from Ferguson. Tight rythmic playing to challenging music, this band rocks. The solos are great some are even awesome. Maynard sounds on top of his game after the disappointing release of These Cats can Swing, his high notes are clean and crisp. The lead trumpet playing is simply put, amazing! A nice tribute to Miles Davis with an arrangement of Milestones. I love this album and I think everyone should check it out. I'm looking forward to next album release of Maynard Ferguson."
3,"""These Cats Can Swing"" proven a hard act to follow","While his followup Big Bop Nouveau album to ""These Cats Can Swing!"" is good, it's just not up to the same snuff. These arrangements are thin enough to make you notice that MF's not in front of a Big Band -- especially the re-work of his classic BIRDLAND, which only make you pine for the days of his full ensemble! Having said that, it's still got great solo work, and the rest of the group is solid."
2,Maynard sounds terrible!,"Too bad Maynard Ferguson didn't stop recording back in the 70's. His solos sound the same on every single track on this recording ""One More Trip to Birdland"". His tone is terrible! Too many years of playing in the stratosphere. I am reluctant to give this recording any stars, however, Maynard has an extremely talented band behind him. Too bad Maynard wouldn't let them play more - and consider retiring. Sorry, Maynard, your music with Stan Kenton is amazing - however this album was not worth my money!"
5,A beautiful and eclectic mix,"The CD lives up to its title, containing New Wave and goth/industrial tracks that mostly evoke a futuristic environ. The tracks are very pop-oriented, and a curious mix of dark industrial and bubbly optimism. Some songs are quite beautiful, like New Order's ""Evil Dust"" and Info Society's ""On the Outside"". Overall, a great listen, and mood-enhancer"
5,Simply outstanding! Nero swings with the best of them.,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have complete mastery and control over an instrument? Peter Nero isn't wondering because he's there. This album is the perfect vehicle for him to show off his chops as a jazz pianist and he proves that he can swing with the best of them. I've played this album for friends and colleagues for the past 10 years and they are always blown away....then they buy it for themselves.The intro to ""Satin Doll"" is especially impressive. You'll wonder whether or not he's somehow added notes to the piano. But, don't stop there because ""Take the 'A' Train"" is the best! It's fast, it's moving, he's all over the place. How does he do that? Who knows, but I know this much...this one is a must have!"
4,Rugged wrist pad -- will last longer than gel,"I went through three soft gel wrist rest pads. All three of them quickly deformed and burst open, oozing sticky gel on my desk. This wrist rest from Fellowes is made of solid foam, not gel. So, I expect it to last for years. The only criticism of this particular item is I would prefer it to be a little bit thicker, but overall it's a very good product."
4,Squeeks At Low Speed Braking,I think I like the OEM brake pads better. These tend to squeek when full pressure is not applied to the brake peddle (like backing out of the garage). They do stop the vehicle well.
4,quite enjoyable,"If you're on the fence about picking one of these up like I was, it's as much a question of hygiene as of stimulation. It's a thoroughly enjoyable product and social concensus shouldn't even factor in the decision.The material feels great and is extremely easy to clean and maintain. There isn't a comparable product for the price besides the Tenga line, which I have no experience with but their non-disposable product is twice the price. However if you're expecting an experience comparable to intercourse, you simply can't find it in a sex toy. That being said, it's a fun distraction with only a few problems. The price may be a little too high for something you basically have to buy blind, and the original insert simply lacks the stimulation of later company entries. If you really want to try one of these grab one of the tight or super-tight(or better yet pornstar)inserts instead."
4,Feels great,"The Fleshlight is amazing for how it feels, especially if you warm it up on hot water before using it. Feels great thrusting in and out of it. It's not exactly like intercourse, but it's close. I came quite quickly using it the first time with no visual stimulation."
3,"Different, but not special.","It does what is is supposed to and feels good, but is too big and bulky. It cleans up nicely, but nobody would ever believe it to be a flash light!"
3,not bad,I loved it used it right out of the box the only problem is hiding the damn thing over sized flash light is very appealing to kids
1,Complete waste of money,"If you're going to get a sleeve, try one WITHOUT a frame so you can add your own pressure when you want.This product is a joke. Unless, of course, you are incredibly well endowed or like banging really loose p##ssy.Lost my hard on as soon as I slipped into this thing, it is SO loose. The pressure cap does absolutely nothing. The product probably costs about $3 to make and they charge almost $60 for it. Really disappointed. It's already in the garbage can.Boy, its a real crap shoot with these products cuz you can't return them. Ugh. Really makes me angry when I get ripped off like this."
1,"OH GOD, WHY?","Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but this is one of the most disturbing things I've ever bought. I thought it would be fun to have. It SOUNDS like the greatest invention in the world, but really, it's the most embarassing thing I've ever had in my possession. I thought it would be fun to have a vagina whenever you want. In reality, I'm throwing it away before someone finds this nasty thing.I think some people will find this really useful. It is very high quality, but it's creepy and I'm throwing it away."
3,"OK, but ...","The 9/16 hole saw size is difficult to find in home stores, so I had to look online for it. Unfortunately Lenox doesn't do a good job of manufacturing saws in this small of a diameter, as I bought two and both were out of round, due to a bulge at the welded seam. They also didn'tbother trimming up the tooth at the seam properly, which made them wobbleand bend the pilot drill constantly during the start of a hole on sheetmetal. It was so bad, one saw body broke off the mounting arbor,and Lenox ignored my e-mails about replacing the broken saw. So I wouldrecommend buying a Bahco bimetal # 3830-14-US. which I found at McMaster-Carr. Bahco actually grinds the entire body at the weld joint and trues up the teeth edges for a much truer cut. A much superior product that youcan even find on Amazon."
5,One of best of late 80s pop metal albums,"I would place this as Lita's most overall enjoyable album, despite the fact that there are some bigger hits and very memorable songs on both Lita and Stiletto. This may be a bit slick for some tastes, but to me it is just an enjoyable listen from beginning to end. Shot of Poison seems to be every bit as good as Kiss Me Deadly. Bad Love is a good ballad. Virtually every song has good hooks. She plays her badgirl image for all it's worth. I find it every bit as good as the best albums by Poison, Bon Jovi,Crue,etc. And she's sexy. And she can play guitar just as well as the guys in those bands. If you like catchy pop metal, doubt you'll be dissapointed."
3,book review,"book was ok, but maybe a bit too technical for one without a degree education in social endeavors."
5,"Great ""starter"" set","I've since graduated to the 5 lb weights, but chose the same model. They are very comfortable to hold and have held up very well."
2,How could I have been so misguided?,"I can't blame the samples for being misleading. There are no samples to listen to! That should have stopped me right there. I was looking for east-west fusion music I could play for massage sessions, real music not schmaltz. I believed the reviews that said this music was soothing yet uplifting, great for meditation or yoga. I should have paid more attention to the one (Hamilton) who said it was a little too upbeat for meditation. The opening track sounds like the Army of the People's Republic of China is about to march. The rest? Uptempo to the point of being bouncy. Not my idea of calm. Who is doing yoga to this?! You'd have to speed up your Tai-Chi to where it looked like Tae-Kwan-Do!"
5,One of my fave cd's,"I bought this years ago! But I still listen to it quite a lot. It's all the forces of nature mixed with human emotions. Each song is rather long, and different, but beautiful all together.Listening to it it makes me feel as if i'm in a sunny forest, hiding from a storm, running through a meadow, or flying..."
3,Hong Kong bootleg...,"I have this plush doll -she is made out of UFO type plush. She is a Hong Kong bootleg or fake, which I knew when I bought her & confirmed with the seller(it's good to be up-front). Very well-made for a bootleg though. She's very squishy, has shiny black shoes, but the wand in her hand is flat felt material.Also available in this set is a serious faced Kero, and a happy face Kero with a red bow tie.Mine is a *special* bootleg because instead of a Card Captor Sakura hang tag, she has a ""Naruto"" hang tag (a boy anime) She also has a paper ""Naruto"" tag sewn on her butt. Someone wasn't careful at the factory. Anyways, she's cute and I love her. I encourage you to only buy bootlegs for fun at low prices but be sure to get the actual licensed versions as well. ^_^"
5,a really good movie,I saw it on televison so i wanna buy the movie. It's a great movie and everyone should rent/buy it/
3,It's of course a question of taste...,"But I personally think, there are three things that makes the essence of a good romance: good story (it is one), beautiful and talented leading actress (she is one), but also a dashing leading actor (sorry, he is not one). I certainly don't mean the acting, they are all very good, especially the pleasant voice of Mr. Urich and Mr. McGaven."
1,Very bad Movie!,"I didn't like this movie at all. No movie made of any books of Danielle Steel is good, well it's rare that a movie is as good as the book is, the book is always better. I had like reading the book but the movie who was made out of it was so bad and boring!"
5,Fantastic Movie!!!!,"I saw this movie twice on TV and loved it both times; I've been looking for it to buy so I can add it to my ""Classic"" collection, along with Dr. Zhivago. Very worth seeing, buying. Robert Urich's performance is fantastic; as usual he pulls the audience in and allows it to feel what he is feeling whether it's laughing or crying. His eyes are so incredible, his look so deep; he easily enters your heart. He did mine... and will remain there."
3,I wanted to love this book,"This is a resource book. It's not one that you can easily read cover to cover. If you have a lot of time to devote to research, then this book might be perfect for you. I ended up not using it much because I did most of my research on the internet and through talking to other couples. It is packed with information, but it would take time to sort through it all."
5,Jean Harlow at her Best,"When ""Red-Headed Woman"" was released it caused quite a stir! This movie is classic Jean Harlow all the way. Anita Loos provided the snappy dialogue to keep the story moving, and Jean added the comic touch. ""Red-Headed Woman"" is the story of Lil Andrews, a girl from the wrong side of the tracks, who works her way up from the office to the country club. Jean, without her platinum blonde hair, is absolutely perfect in the role of Lil. Una Merkel is a winner in a supporting role as Lil's best friend. This definately is Jean Harlow at her finest."
4,A book worth reading,"I received this book as a present, not knowing much about the author, I decided to give it a try. The book captured my attention and drew me in as each of the characters told their story. There were many unsettling things brought about by this book, but like life itself, it told many aspects of life people try to brush over. Greg Sarris has a way of storytelling that brings the reader into the story and want for more. If you enjoy stories of families and their personal struggles, you too will enjoy this book."
1,Wheres the value,"Consumer Guide completely misses the mark here. They miss major and minor defects with automobiles. For example, they missed paint defects, and head gasket problems with my 1994 Mercury Cougar whereas Lemonaid Guide to Used Cars caught all problems I have encountered.It appears all vehicles are presented in a positive light and that is not the case. Don't waste your money here. Lemonaid Guide to Used Cars is a far superior choice."
3,I really WANTED to like this CD...,"I really wanted to like this CD. I heard the Pete Escovedo orchestra play a wonderful outdoor concert in the sunshine, and I was still hearing those glorious latin rhythms in head for weeks. But this CD - what a disappointment. Maybe it'll grow on me, but none of the edge that I heard live was there. Instead, just a smooth ""light-jazz"" sound that might be great for customer service on-hold recording, but isn't really something that I want playing in my living room. This isn't quite elevator music, or even Kenny G -- but it's just not nearly as good as this band can be.Next time Pete Escovedo comes to town, I'll be first in line for tickets to the live show. I'll probably even buy another couple of his recordings. But next time around, I'll be sure to listen before I buy."
1,Don't Bother,"I love a good chic book, but these are awful. I should have checked the copyright dates I guess, these are both recycled from the early '80s. And I guess I won't believe Nora Roberts' recommendations again, either. In short, these two novels are simply silly. The writing reads like something from an overwrought high school girl. If you have an IQ above 80 you will be bored silly."
2,Eating in Montreal,"This book is wonderful for finding ""out of the way"" spots to eat in Montreal. I borrowed a copy some years ago and found it excellent. Therefore, when I saw it offered, I ordered it, assuming that it would be updated -- the description did not give a date of refision. When I got the book, I was dismayed to see that it is in fact a 2006 edition -- a lot will change in restaurants in 6 years!.However, our planned trip to Montreal has been postponed from New Years to March so I'll be interested to find out which of these places are still operating but it would be really nice to have recent reviews."
5,One of The Bay Area's finest rap groups,"Headed by the one and only JT Tha Bigga Figga, the Get Low Playaz (GLP) have been droppin hits since the early 90's, putting Fillmoe-San Francisco on the hip hop map. Every song on this cd is superb. JT produces every single track supplying the listener with innovative Frisco sounds and beats that will have even your great-grandmother bobbing her head. Aside from the tight beats are the tight rhymes. San Quinn, D- Moe, Seff Tha Gaffla, and JT Tha Bigga Figga himself spit flows that will have real heads recognizing the true Frisco sound. The best thing about this album is that all the best tracks from each GLP release is available on one cd. Buy this cd and do the Get Low dance to the Bay Area's number one independent rap group. -- Game recognize game, in tha Bay mang --"
1,didn't send what I ordered,"I thought I was getting unbleached filters, based on the picture on the Amazon website. Instead I received bleached filters. I called to request assistance for an exchange, noone answered, left a message, and received no response. Wouldn't order from these people again."
2,Do You Believe In Magic?,"This was the first book by Carpentier that I have read, and I was surprised by how little I connected with the story line and characters. It felt a little sketchy for the scope of the narrative, which involves slave rebellions, voodoo, the extravagances of colonialism, all set in the tropical heat of Haiti. Perhaps its charm lies in hinting at possibilities, and yet I expected more from a writer who is often considered the father of magic realism. I found myself wondering how I would have reacted to the book if I had read it 20 or 30 years ago. Maybe with more intensity, more awe. Ultimately I was glad I read it as an historical perspective, and as a way of understanding the seeds of inspiration he undoubtedly provided other writers, who delved more deeply into the implications of a form of fiction that was not yet fully realized."
1,great mini series,"i was 19 years old when this series aired on tv. I stayed up every nigh for 7 nights taping each episode and taking out the commercials. More tot he point. the $40 million ABC spents was well worth it. some may call AMERIKA propaganda, but it is just a 'what if' movie. but, it does make you think about your freedoms.great performances all around, especially by sam neil, kris kristofferson and robert urich. Be sure to keep an eye out for a 17 year old LARA FLYNN BOYLE. she ws terrific."
1,Didn't Love This,"I love this author,but she just didn't get there with this story. It was really slow and not enough connection between our hero and heroine for my liking."
3,Not Quite As Good As The Greenies For Dogs,"Good product, but does not seem to clean our cats' teeth as well as the Greenies for dogs."
3,CAT TREATS,"I HAVE 3 CATS WITH VERY DIVERSE TASTE, ONLY ONE OF THEM LIKES IT AND HES THE ONE WITH HARDLY ANY TEETH. SO GO FIGURE."
1,Misrepresentation by omission!,"My wife just received her full shipment of Waechtersbach Christmas plates; salad and dinner and an oval serving platter. When one sees the word dinner plates, salad plates, and platter, the mind conjures up a visual of the place setting on one's dinner table. To me a ""PLATTER"" is larger than a dinner plate since it is designed to SERVE a group of people. Your photo of the Waechtersbach serving platter was without any background so one couldn't see that the platter's size would only be good for serving elves, not normal sized humans! The dimensions of this $42.95 platter are 10.5 inches by 7 inches - smaller than a standard sheet of paper! I doubt that we would have paid $42.95 if we knew the platter was a ""micro-platter"". Might I request that in future displays, you include the dimensions of the product? $.58 per sqaure inch is kind of steep for a microplatter."
5,Amazing Results,"I like many other people went through a lot of stress with the financial crisis and resulting recession. The front portion of my hairline thinned noticeably and after trying several other things such as supplements, I tried this out. It took about two months before I really started noticing the regrowth but I am about 70% back to normal thickness now after 8 months of use. It's not overnight but it does work."
4,good product with surprising benefit,"Not only has it helped with hair volume but it actually kept my hair from frizzing when I was in Florida (where it ALWAYS frizzes), which was a nice surprise.As for the hair growth, since I've also been taking supplements (horsehair, biotin, Biosil, and iron), I don't know if it's this product or those supplements or the whole combinaton that has resulted in new hair around my hairline. Whatever reason, I'm using the combination. This product does help with volume, though, without drying out your hair."
2,Pass!,"I have typical male pattern hair thinning and alopecia areata. I'm always looking for new product that will stimilate new hair growth and loved the ingredient list and name of this. I have been using this for nearly two months and have not noticed any volume benefits or signs of hair growth. The bottle is small and 4 squirts per use will last about 3 weeks. While I continue to try JM products, I consistently am underwhelmed. This one is like wetting my hair down with fancy water!Take a pass on this one."
5,Love it,"This product really helped with my hair loss issues. Its like a multi vitamin for you hair. I love that its organic, if your concern is hair re-growth organic and natural is the way to go. It is a bit expensive but a little goes a long way. I spray it generously on my roots and ends after a shower."
5,Great product and service~,I am very please with the service and the product~ Its a wonderful product that really is organic and feels great! My hair loves it!
4,all natural hair & scalp treatment,"You can't go wrong with any of John Masters Organics products. Formulated with the best natural ingredients, including essential oils, these hair and scalp products do only good things for you. No chemicals. Nothing that can hurt your skin or hair. I've been using the deep scalp follicle treatment for years, and I keep returning for more whenever I feel my hair/scalp need extra pampering. This treatment is clear and not at all greasy or oily. Shake and spray on your scalp while hair is still damp. Then massage in well, and you're done until the next shampoo."
4,classic explanations of stars,"This reprint of the 1939 book by Chandrasekhar lets you read through one of the major works on the evolution of a star. The author takes physics equations, labouriously discovered over centuries, in terrestrial environments. He applies them logically to the vastly different circumstances of a star. Yet, step by step, he shows how we can arrive at an understanding of stellar processes that jibes with much that was observable in the 1930s. A tribute to the precision and insight of his thinking, as well as to the power of physics to model phenomena anywhere in the universe.Actually, in the subsequent decades, the equations derived in the book held up quite well as coherent explanations of stars. While the field has moved on, the explanatory pedagogy given in this book may still often be seen in recent astrophysics texts."
3,What's up with the color?,"The trim kit was the right size and type to replace my old one. Very easy to install (I also replaced the cartridge - knob pulls in & out very smoothly ). The only thing I was dissapointed with was the color of the trim plate. I had replaced the shower head, tub spout and overflow plate prior to finding the trim kit on Amazon. They are all brushed nickel and look the same. The trim kit is off by a few shades. It looks like a mixture of 25% chrome and 75% brushed nickel. The difference doesn't ""glare"" at you but you do notice it."
2,Wrong image shown,"I was very disappionted when I opened the box for this part. I needed the deep Moen Eustacheon, but recieved the shallower version (not what's pictured). I called Danco and they don't even make a brushed nickel version for the older/deeper Moen's. I returned it for a refund."
4,Historically Accurate,"A very touching account of life, by a woman who lived in Atlanta, during the Civil War. The book is historically accurate, but it does reflect the Southern attitude of the period. A very good book for a serious student of Southern History. Not for everyone."
2,"Boring mystery, more boring discourse on ethics","This was my first exposure to Smith's work and I was excited: he has such a big following. I lasted 50 pages. Except for a visit to the symphony and a walk to her duaghter's corner deli, the main chatacter could have been a brain in a vat. She seems to live 90% of her life inside her head. I learned from my fellow reviewers that this is a book on applied ethics. Smith tells us that it is unethical for a reporter to visit the parents of a dead boy the night after his surprise demise. Go figure. He also tells us that a mother doesn't know how much to meddle in her daughter's love life. Again, go figure."
2,Very disappointing!,"I really enjoyed the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency and was looking forward to reading this new series. However, I did not find the main character, Isabel, to be likeable at all. She came across as judgmental, stuffy and pretentious. The story took way too long to get moving and, even then, it left me feeling empty. The ending was a tremendous letdown that frustrated me and had me wondering why I bothered to finish reading this book in the first place. I really hurried through this book so that I could read something more interesting and satisfying. The main character's internal dialog was excessive and long-winded. There was too much philosophizing and too many references (obscure to me) to music, books and art."
3,Less than I'd hoped for,"I've read most of the ""The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency"" books and was entranced by the characters in them. Maybe the author had hoped for the same effect with this series, but it didn't happen for me. I didn't get wrapped up in the personality of the main character or any of them, and eventually wasn't interested in what they were doing."
2,A good start that fizzled at the end.,"Having enjoyed other of Mr. Smith's books, I was looking forward to reading this one. An excellent beginning and an interesting cast of characters kept me reading about Isabel and her world. However, the book suddenly took a turn and ended with a most disappointing 3 or so chapters. I truly wish I had not paid good money for this book. I am not sure if Mr. Smith ran out of steam, or truly thought he was being sublime. The book's ending did not work - at all - and I am not sure I would read another in this series."
3,The jury is still out on this one.....,"I have read all of the #1 Detective Agency Series and thought them to be fresh and entirely delightful. This new series gives us a new female detective friend that seems full of promise, but I have to say that the first book left me dangling a bit more than comfort allows. At the end of the last chapter I found myself looking around for the rest of the story. Everything ended so abruptly and without the resolution of so many loose ends that I felt abandoned. Hopefully, these items will be resoved in future stories, but I have to say that what began as a pleasurable experience, ended in confusion. The profuse philosophical ponderings were an interesting experience, but at times I found myself skipping through entire pages just to get on with it. A few less pages of rambling and a few more pages of resolution would have suited me just fine. Will I read the next one? Probably. Loyalty to a favorite author will most likely grant him another chance."
1,Disappointed,"I loved Precious and was delighted to meet another McCall Smith character. Although Isabel Dalhousie is an interesting and likeable character, the book was overall a big disappointment. It appears the author simply tired of the story and in order to meet the deadline for publication, ended the story abruptly, leaving the reader feeling quite cheated. I kept yelling at the book anyway...the entire time...WHO WAS WITH MARK FRASER at Usher Hall in the first place and WHERE are the Sunday Philosophers? If only Precious had walked into this story... I will be afraid to buy another McCall Smith book."
2,Horribly disappointing,"Of course I loved the Botswana series, so I bought this one in the hope that it would be as wonderful as its predecessor. I am about a 1/3rd the way in and I'm completely bored with it. I find myself skipping paragraphs and forcing myself to read on. I don't think I will continue at this rate.I met McCall-Smith on his tour of Phila, and I thought he was charming. But in this book I feel like he is trying to almost show off his extensive knowledge of philosophy etc...rather than weave an intriguing and arresting story. Perhaps he needs a writing break - I also found #6 in the Mma Ramotswe saga a bit disappointing...perhaps he should have wrapped up the series at #5. And there are still 2 more to go....."
3,Mystery & Ethics,"The Sunday Philosophy Clubis a fun mystery with intellectual considerations of ethics that, to me, either miss the mark or are incomplete.There is also aLarge Printedition."
3,Isabel Dalhousie didn't win my heart,"This book was ok, but certainly did not hold my interest and delight in reading every page like the Ladies Detective Agency novels. I didn't really care much about Isabel Dalhousie and her troubles. She seemed like just a busy body rather than a detective like Mama Ramotswe. I admit I love the African setting better than Scotland and I guess I will stick to the Detective Agency novels from now on."
3,Enjoyable - 3.5 stars,"I'm surprised at the plethora of negative reviews. I enjoyed this book, not the best I've ever read, but enjoyable nonetheless.This is a story set in Edinburgh and perhaps, because I grew up there, I was drawn to that aspect more than the enjoyment of the ladies detective series. I enjoyed walking the streets of my old home town and the way the author captured the Edinburgh mindset - a slightly ""snooty"" attitude amongst many residents, but a beautiful city with a lot of history and a lot of well read, intelligent citizens.I think Isabel Dalhousie needs time to be fleshed out into a more well rounded character. This is just the first introduction to her and her 'quirks' are new to the reader.I agree with other reviews that the mystery was 'solved' rather abruptly, but I look forward to seeing more of Grace, Cat, and Jamie."
1,Forget about it,"It seems interesting when you start reading it, it becomes more interesting as you go on, and then, there comes the ending that ruins everything. I felt very very silly to have bought the book!!!"
4,Read this.....you won't be sorry.,"If you want a comfortable book which has many gems of knowledge and insight, read a McCall-Smith book. I haven't found one that I didn't like. You feel like you personally know his characters. You realize that people everywhere share the same problems, likes and dislikes, dreams, aspirations, disappointments and well........the human experience of living."
3,"slow book, annoying heroine","Isabel Dalhousie is a philosopher, and as such, drones endlessly on about issues that I couldn't care less about. I gave it 3 stars because I finished it, and because I became sort of interested halfway through in spite of myself, and I didn't hate it. I do generally enjoy books by this author, which is why I picked it up. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend."
4,First Isabel Dalhousie Mystery,"This is the first book I have read in this series. Isabel goes to the theatre for a concert and sees a young man fall to his death from the high seats. She asks gestions which leads her to believe he was most likely murdered. She begins an investigation into the death with the help of her niece's ex-boyfriend, Jamie. As with all Alexander McCall Smith it is rich in language. I like reading about other countries and ways of lif in his books.I have purchased the other books in this series and I look forward to them as well."
1,NOT the Number One Ladies Detective Agency!,I couldn't finish this book. Totally different than the charming Number One Ladies Detective Agency series which I just love. I was very disappointed.
3,The Formula Moves Country,"There is something about The Number 1 Ladies' Detective Agency that is instantly pleasin and engaging - perhaps it the exotic location, or the simple-yet-wise characters. Isabel Dalhousie has glaringly obvious similarities to Precious Ramotswe - an independent woman, briefly and disastrously married, and involved in a ""mystery"". Unlike Ramotswe, who is hired to solve questions for clients, Dalhousie is simply morbidly nosy. She sees a young man fall to his death. Traumatic, yes, but a justification for going snooping into the shared flat the departed lived in?The story has a conclusion, which not all of McCall Smith's do, but there is just something too smug and cold about Dalhousie to interest the reader. It's a shame that this is developping into a series, when McCall Smith could be concentrating on The Number One Ladies Detective Agency instead."
5,I really enjoyed this book!!,"This book reminded me of Amanda Cross's mysteries. It is a very pleasant read and allows you to reflect on various philosophical thoughts along with the main character, Isabel. I hope more adventures follow for Isabel, as I quite enjoyed her company!"
2,Let down at the end,I enjoyed the book until the lst three pages. The end was such a let down it ruined the entire book for me.
3,I was really looking forweard to this...,"...but I was disappointed. Smith's rustic African philosophy worked well, for a while anyway, but I find that he did not translate well to the urbane setting of Edingurgh. This book took forever to get going, and the slow pace was irritating. Far too much philosophy and other introspection. Finally we get to some sleuthing, but this is, alas, not satisfying at all. Perhaps Smith will be able to get things into gear a little more quickly in the next book in this series, but I will not purchase it if it gets the same kind of reviews that Philosophy Club has been getting."
2,"Not Mma Ramotswe, that's for sure","If you expect this to be as good as the No 1 Ladies Detective Agency books, you will be sadly disappointed as was I. It's just not that good a book, it's well written but awfully dull."
3,I was really looking forweard to this...,"...but I was disappointed. Smith's rustic African philosophy worked well, for a while anyway, but I find that he did not translate well to the urbane setting of Edinburgh. This book took forever to get going, and the slow pace was irritating. Far too much philosophy and other introspection. Finally we get to some sleuthing, but this is, alas, not satisfying at all. Perhaps Smith will be able to get things into gear a little more quickly in the next book in this series, but I will not purchase it if it gets the same kind of reviews that Philosophy Club has been getting."
3,Too much philosophy,Good plot but far too wordy.Characters are interesting and well developed. I will try the next in the series and see if it is better.
2,Seemed to drag,"I love the Ladies Detective stories, I have read all 13 but this story didn't seem to go anywhere. I will try another series."
2,LIke Waiting for Water to Boil,Be warned: Isabel isn't wonderful Precious. This is a dull read...like staring out the window on a foggy overcast day. I can hardly believe that this is the same author who scribed The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency.
4,The Sunday Philosophy Club,I thought it was a good book easy reading and enjoyable and still challenged the reader. I will enjoy the others in that series I'm sure.
3,Isabel grows on you...,"After falling in love with The No 1 Ladies Detective Agency series, I couldn't wait to read all of Mr. McCall Smith's novels. I was a bit disappointed initially, but halfway through the Sunday Philosophy Club I found that Isabel Dalhousie grew on me. The remaining novels, Friends, Lovers and Chocolate and The Right Attitude to Rain were inviting and entertaining. Although this is not my favorite of his series, I would recommend reading them."
4,TOTALLY CAPTIVATING,"Smith has introduced a wonderful new character. Isabel enchants throughout this semi crime story. As in his African books the plot is peripheral. It is the thinking, the philosophy, the human-ness of the central characters that charm, and involve the reader.My only caveat is the Perry Mason denouement. Isabel has a suddent enlightenment and the ""perp"" confesses. No explanation or rationale for this hurried ending. But, the moral conclusion was right on.With pleasure, I anticipate more in this series."
1,The Sunday Philosophy Club,"This book is slow, slow, slow. AM Smith spends a lot of space and energy on name dropping obscure and not so obscure authors and philosophers. Is this meant to be amusing? I wasn't amused. He is in love with his own words. His vocabulary is unnecessarily foggy!It took forever to tell the ""story"" such as it was. And the problems got solved too quickly, too easily and in unrealistic ways."
1,"I'm sorry, but this was awful","I absolutely love the Ladies Detective Club series, and was really excited to find that Mr. Smith was starting another series, quite different from the first. This book was, in a word, awful. I only finished it because I was trying to find some redeeming quality, but none surfaced. I normally share my books with a number of friends; this one was dumped in the Good Will box (and I apoligize to them). The plot was non-existent, the charater development was poor, and the ending was one of the most disapointing I have encountered in years. I have no doubt that there will be another in this series--there were so many plot lines left hanging, and questions asked, but not answered. Bottom line--do not waste your time or money."
2,A big disappointment!,"I bought this book because I loved the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series of books by this author. Unfortunately, this book lacks the charm of those books, and the main character (Isabel Dalhousie) isn't nearly as interesting as Mma Ramotswe. In fact, I found her to be rather boring, bordering on unlikeable. The supposed ""Sunday Philosophy Club"" is only mentioned once or twice, and the members (if there are any- maybe it's a figment of her imagination) are never even introduced! The ending was extremely anti-climatic, and to get there, you have to wade through boring philosophical musings that rarely have anything much to do with the subject matter or plot (what little there is of it). I really wanted to like this book, and I tried, but McCall Smith missed the mark on this one. I hope he goes back to writing the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency books."
1,Boring,"I too, am a fan of the Precious Remotswe series with it's gentle writing, soft discriptions, and endearing characters. Not so with this book.Boring, cold fish characters, and a pace so slow I continually fell asleep trying to work my way through this drivel.Forget this one, and just stick to The No 1 Ladies Detective Agency."
1,"Precious, where are you when we need you!","I have wasted three evenings on this book, hoping that it would eventually show some of the sparkle and grace of the Botswana sextet. But no. It was a pure bomb, and I will not waste my time on another of his books until he gets back to Africa. I find it hard to believe that the NY Times said that readers of the Precious Series would love this one. It is the exact opposite, as reader comments have confirmed."
2,A tiresome read.,"Compares poorly with the Ladies Detective series. The charm is all gone - what's left is a lot of heavy-handed moral philosophising. The protagonist is certainly no prig, but hardly a page goes by without her speculating or gossiping in excruciating detail about the correct or incorrect way to behave in some situation. Apparently the author thinks these tedious meanderings lend some depth and weight to the paltry storyline. I just want my Mma back."
1,A Big Letdown,"I really, really wanted to like this book, I enjoy Mr. Smith's other series so much. I have to admit I couldn't even get through the book. I thought the main character pretentious and kept waiting for something to happen, to form a connection with her. Never happened. Boring, slow and just not for me. Sorry Mr. Smith, I don't normally like to write bad reviews, but I just couldn't let this one go by without a word of warning to everyone who likes the other series."
4,The Sunday Pholosophy Club,"As with all his novels, I LOVE the story lines, but, in my opinion, there's too much extraneous material that's not interesting to me. I tend to skip it. In this book, it almost seemed as though the author just wanted to show the reader the extent of his knowledge."
2,Where's the philosophy? And the club?,"Although this was a slightly pleasant cozy mystery read, I was disappointed that, not only did the Philosophy Club never meet in the book, the philosophy concepts discussed were: 1)simplistic; and 2) droning and intrusive to the story. In fact, I found most of Isabel's thoughts to herself to be far too instrusive to the plot. The ending was also abrupt and failed to tie up some loose ends and unbelievable plot elements.As most fans of Smith have noted, this is not one of his better books. Though I will probably not read another in the Dalhousie series, I may try another of his books."
1,I'm so insulted . . .,". . .that Alexander Mccall Smith would think readers would actually enjoy this book. It was the worst book I've ever read in my life. All attempts at jokes were flat and unfunny. There was no plot, or any relevant information to the story and the ending was pathetic. What the hell is the Sunday Philosophy Club?This so-called murder ""mystery"" was about as suspenseful as watching a turtle sleeping. Did his publisher even bother to read the manuscript? What boring crap!"
4,Prose for the soul. Life is good.,"Ok, I agree that the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency seems to have more flavor than the Isabel Dalhousie series - but isn't it because we find Africa much more exciting than Scotland? Because we find it exotic and warm and we are pleasantly surprised with the human universals we discover in Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi?My opinion is that both series have the same writing quality, it is just that we don't know as much about Botswana and its people, as we know about Europe. And it makes it a more interesting read for us - as I am sure it would be the reverse for the African readers.I liked the first novel of the Isabel Dalhousie series, it is a very enjoyable read. And the series gets better and better. I like the warmth and goodness and common sense that emmanate from McCall Smith's prose. It just feels good, cozy even. No big surprises, just a book to keep you good company, anytime, anywhere, and to remind us that life is good (and we can contibute to that, too)."
2,A Disappointment,"After reading Alexander McCall Smith's delightful ""#1 Ladies Detective Agency"" series, I was really looking forward to the ""Sunday Philosophy Club"". I was very disappointed in it, the style is quite different, rambling and tedious. It goes so far off on uninteresting tangents that I found myself skipping whole pages trying to get back to the plot. For those who loved the simplicity of the stories about Botswana's #1 detective, I would recommend avoiding Scotland's stuffy old lady sleuth...she's not Miss Marple."
2,Somewhat Disappointing,"I wanted desperately to love this book, but I merely liked it, and I can't even say I liked all of it. Perhaps I was looking for another ""No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency"", but this book does not have the charm that the ""No. 1 Ladies"" series has. Part of the problem may be that I'm not that well read a person, because many of the references in this book went right over my head, and I found that I was forcing myself to just get through many of the chapters. The mystery in this book was not that interesting and it's conclusion uneventful. Having said all that, I did like Isabel, Jamie, Cat and Grace and McCall Smith does a wonderful job describing Edinburgh. Therefore, I can see the potential for a very interesting series of books in the future. Let's hope the next one is better. I will certainly give it a try."
2,Not much of a mystery!,"I truly wanted to like The Sunday Philosophy Club. There were, however, too many loose ends and forks in the road that didn't amount to anything suspenseful or satisfying. I kept with it to the end thinking that just maybe it would have some redeeming fabulous ending. It didn't. I don't want the author to give up though, because his Precious Ramatswe adventures were wonderful. This was disappointing knowing what wonderful stories he is capable of creating."
2,Disappointing,"McCall Smith showed a great insight into character and culture with his Precious Ramotswe series. The heroine of this series reflects the decline in character and values which is found in all peoples. Unlike Mma Ramotswe, shedoes not typify the best of her people and her culture, but rather some of its decadence."
2,unlikable and rather dull heroine,"I picked up the first and second book in this series, but after reading the The Sunday Philosophy Club (the first entry) I think I'll stop there. The main character is rather dull and dimwitted -- especially to be a self-proclaimed ""philosopher."" She bumbles her way through this ""mystery"" and it ends rather flatly. Disappointing work from McCall Smith. I think that if he hadn't already been an established author this would never have been picked up by a publisher."
2,Dull & Disappointing,"Dull and disappointing, especially after the delightful ""Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency"" series. It was hard to get into the story, and difficult to finish."
3,He would admit this is not his Best,"McCall Smith is on a roll -- in Africa at least.His detective agency in Africa is always 4- or 5-star. This original in Scotland is 3-stars, at best. But, it is better than 90% of the rest of the items at the stores.I predict the following books will be better.He still can buy an annuity off my purchases."
3,"an adequate read, I guess","I had looked forward to this book, being an fan of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series.The mystery was adequate, but I had hoped to feel more of the culture, and home life of the protagonist, Ms. Dalhousie. In No.1 Ladies Detective Agency, I felt as though I could stop by for a cup of bush tea. The information was there in this mystery, I guess, but it did not create a picture for me. In fact, I had to look back at the book to remember her name.Unfortunately, this new series, at least so far, does not give you the feeling of ""knowing"" your detective. And that is what makes me come back.Having said that, I will try the next installment, I just hope the author can, through his words, show me enough about Ms. Dalhousie so that I would begin to understand her. I would like her to become a person to me."
2,Not the same spark as Ladies Detective Agency....,I ran out and got this book because I had thoroughly enjoyed the Ladies Detective Agency series by A McCall Smith.I find that the main character is not likeable. In Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency Mma Ramotswe is a likeable character despite her imposition of morals onto others. There is a certain charm that generates reader interest. I don't find that to be the case in this book at all.I am not even finished the book yet but I don't know if I will be able to get through it.
2,"not #1 Ladies, and not even Portuguese Irregular Verbs","I'm sorry, but the verbose ramblings of the mind of Isabel Dalhousie are not very interesting, and this murder mystery is not terribly engaging. I wanted to like this book much more than I did. Like many other Amazon reviewers, I like the simple life and the precious wisdom (pun intended) in Africa so much better. The final turn of events uncovering the mystery were disappointing too, making me wonder why I endured the book. One of the latter scenes in the story made little sense and was not explained (the ""intruder""). Hmmmmmm... I really expected better from Alexander McCall-Smith."
3,An okay sunday...,"The Sunday Philosophy Club was written by the author of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, a book I actually didn't love. This series is set in Edinburgh, Scotland and recounts the adventures of a very curious philosopher and editor of the Applied Ethics Journal, Isabel Dalhousie. Isabel attends a symphony and watches a man fall off the balcony down to his death. She then gets herself entangled in the mystery of this young man's death. The books has many engrossing moments (it took only a few days to finish), but at many points in meanders and introduces inconsequential characters who do not add to the plot, but rather make the book plod along."
2,Well written but character and story a bore.,"I know this is not the continuation of the Botswana series, but still... and I LOVE Edinburgh, Scotland, but that still wasn't enough to redeem this bore. Parts read like a philosophy doctoral theses, cramming in as many citations and name-dropping Philosophers like mad. And the final blow after I made it all the way to the end? A total cop-out of an solution."
1,A crashing disappointment,"While I did not expect the likes of Mma Ramotswe to be ""transported"" to Scotland, I did expect the author to present us with a new series marked by his easy charm and wisdom. The plot begins with the witnessing of a death, and then veers off course at great length. The constant weighing of the ethics by Isabel in every aspect of her very uninteresting existence (whether or not to pursue the events of the death; whether or not to confront her niece about a boyfriend's suspected infidelty; whether or not to publish a terribly dry and uninteresting article in an ethics journal; whether or not to take the bus or walk to the shops) drags the book down. The only bright spot is the opinionated housekeeper. Perhaps the author could build a series around her!Luckily, the title ""club"" never appears. If it did, I fear the police would be called in - I would have been bored to death!"
3,Authentic and engaging ... for a while,"As a former resident of Edinburgh (not too far from where Isabel lives), I can vouch for the skill with which Mr McCall brings the setting to life. And I found Isabel's philosophical musings thought-provoking and entertaining. As a mood and brain piece, therefore, it was evocative and engaging. But the mystery aspect of the tale was badly let down by the ending: flat, dreich and damp as an October afternoon in Edinburgh's Meadows. The run-up had promised so much more, and I'd hoped for a really challenging, mind-stretching revelation that would have made sense of some of the minor characters' actions. It doesn't happen."
2,Nothing Precious here,I'm through the book and still waiting for the first charming moment. I loved the first few books in his earlier series; I wanted to like this as well. It was tough going.
3,Enjoyable Casual Reading,"Well written but a little too preachy. I often ended up skipping the philosophical explanations of certain moralities that were lengthy for how simplistic they were. I never could engage with the characters. Not an engrossing book, but enjoyable to pick up and read a chapter occasionally."
3,Slightly Boring..,"Isabel is a middle-aged spinster, an editor of a little-known magazine. She sees a young man fall to his death and wants to find out what really happened and starts to investigate with the help of another young man who was her niece's former sex-partner aka boyfriend. I think Isabel wants to have a piece of action herself and why not! It is not really that good but I think I am interested enough to read other books in the series. With dearth of good writers, and in this age of instant coffee, I, too, want instant gratification. And McCall has this ability to provide entertainment in fair measure."
4,Impressed Despite Subpar Mystery,"Like another reviewer, I also found the writing pretentious at times. Isabel wasn't much of a detective, failing to ask the most obvious question, the answer to which would have resolved the ""mystery"" in about two pages.Still I liked the book and will begin the second in the series immediately.I enjoyed the philosophical ramblings, the history, the vivid imagery and the emotional depth.In some ways, I prefer it to the Botswana mysteries which are big on charm, but didn't really challenge me the way this book did."
2,Disappointing,Bought this because I love the Alexander McCall Smith's books in the Ladies Detective Agency series. What a tedious disappointment. I hope Smith rethinks his new heroine and her interest in Philosophy. The Scottish setting was great. Advise fans to wait for book two.
1,I wish I liked it!,Characters are flat. I don't really care about the Art and Music. Murder mystery was so boring I found out that I didn't care who killed him. Read 3/4 of the book and shut the pages!
2,A Leap into Disappointment,"This book hooked me with its opening scene, but then, like the young man seen on page one, it went downhill rapidly. Although I enjoyed the plots in the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series, its charming leading lady, and its beautifully described setting in Botswana, none of these qualities is present here. This book is thin on plot and thick on pretense, chatter, and philosophical and moral ponderings that are sometimes downright fatuous and boring. I skipped much of those passages and jumped to the dialog and plot, which meant I read this pretty quickly without missing much. I was sorry to be disappointed with this work but I don't think I'll be reading book 2 of the series any time soon. The leading lady here is just a bore."
1,Such a disapppointment!,"I absolutely loved the No. 1 Detective Agency series, fun engaging characters, plot that moves fairly rapidly. The Sunday Philosophy Club has none of the above. Boring characters leading a boring life. Really no interesting details about Scotland either. Unless you are in the mood for a snoozer, steer clear of this one."
3,"Whoops. Back to the No. 1 Ladies, Please","I have thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Smith's No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, but the new Dalhousie stories can be left to their own devices. I am not much of a mystery reader, but this new theme is without a tinge of the great humor found in the first books. Also, the ethics discussions flounder about while I'm sure Kant et al are madly rolling over and over. The killer can be figured out before the reader is half-way finished or much earlier depending on the repeated perusal of other mysteries. What happened to Arthur Conan Doyle when we need him?"
4,Great book for backpackers,"I have tried several of the recipes and they have been excellent. Even some of the more interesting combinations (especially the lunches) were far better than I would have thought. I highly recommend this book to the backpacker that hates to cook, simmer, clean up and generally mess around with food. Many of the recipes in the book have a common theme - boil water, pour, wait and eat. My kind of cooking and much, much better than most of the commercially available freeze dried meals. The prep (what little there is) is done at home. The weight and calorie information provided for each meal is a great help planning for long trips or winter camping where you need the fuel.Why not 5 stars with such accolades? The repetitive cooking directions after each recipe. Add more recipes and consolodate the instructions. Otherwise a great book, a must for the serious backpacker."
4,an excellent insight for those who want to listen,"Legislating morality is a thought-provoking book. It provides hard facts to support the need to do what is right in our society. The book shows that those protesting against legislating morality are actually advocating the legislation of their own morality. No rational person will continue to oppose the move to instill sanity in our society by providing boundaries for human behavior. To avoid legislating morality will bring us to a situation ""when Israel had no kings and everyone did what was right in his own eyes""!. The greatest deaf is the one who does not want to listen!Rev. Ben N. Nwaochei, Ph.D"
1,Trite and repetitious,"A typical series of jeremiads on Christian Right bugbears. I found it hard to suppress a sneer when I found that Geisler was using discredited antigay pseudoscientist Paul Cameron as his antigay source. Francis Beckwith's rather hackneyed a priori Aristotlean ""logic"" related to abortion has been dealt with in a number of critical reviews on his ""PC Death"" book. Shrill, cliched, paranoid...this is a typical American defense of religious liberty in which the religious take any liberties they want, especially with objective and neutral science"
2,Too confusing,"I bought this and felt let down. The instuctions are confusing, have too many cross references, and assume a certain amount of skill. This is definitely not what I would call straight forward. I would absolutely not recommend this to a beginner as it can be overwhelming. I ended up not using one bit of information from this book. I also found the ideas to be either too stuffy or relaxed, I couldn't find a middle ground. I found Window Style to be much more informative"
2,Not exactly simple,"I purchased this book because after searching the entire internet, it was the only item that I could find that showed a curtain for an arched window. The book was helpful in making a pattern but was very vague in its instructions. Since I have been sewing for 36 years I was able to overcome that obstacle, but beginning sewers will have difficulty following the instructions. So, if you're an experienced seamstress and want to make a curtain for an arched (or half moon) window, buy this book, if not, think twice."
5,Beautiful... but worth the price?,"The Sands of Time music is simply beautiful. A beautiful soundtrack for $70-$100 though? Ehh... It's pretty hard to justify that kind of money being spent on a soundtrack. Price aside though, it really is an excellent soundtrack."
3,Two Way Golf Club from Quolf,Material and craftsmanship appear to be very good. I was a little disappointed that The striking facesof the club were not scored or etched with a gripping surface.
4,Putting for Fun,This putter allows me to be versatile while practicing my stroke. I enjoy the using it to compete against myself.
4,A Super Classic Horror Film!,"This is one of our favorite classic horror films, and I was so happy to find a used copy (in VERY GOOD CONDITION) here on Amazon. It was a gift for a classic horror fan, and it went over as well as I thought it would, if not better! Thanks Amazon!"
5,When will this be on DVD,This is a great classic for all the Michael Landon fans out there. Can hardly wait until it is on DVD.It is an easy sell
1,Difficult to read results,"I bought these as they were such good value for the numbers you got. However, i found the OPK very dificult to read, i have used other brands which have been easier. I nearly always got a thin line on the result line which was so close in color to the control line, in the end i have given up trying to read these and bought another brand."
4,"Great test, A bit hard to read.","These seem to work really well. The only problem is trying to decide if the test mark is as dark or darker than the comparison mark. This is what tells you there is an LH surge. I have used these the last 3 months. This last month they were really hard to read because of this comparison. I couldn't tell if the test line was as dark as the comparison line because they were so close in color. My eyes were playing tricks on me. The previous months it was pretty obvious when the LH surge occured. A friend of mine used LH surge strips with out a comparision line, maybe those would be easier????"
4,A Cheap Alternative to Monitors or Expensive OPKs,"Good value for so many OPKs - could test multiple times a day around O time to make sure I caught the surge. When I got a +, it was only dark on one half of the test line & a little difficult to compare, but not bad for such a cheap OPK. The pregnancy tests are crap though - they get evap lines every time right around the time limit."
2,Hard to read - you get what you pay for.,"The ovulation tests are extremely confusing and hard to read. There is a line that appears that is so close to a positive line, but they say it is negative. It is nearly impossible to tell the difference between positive and negative. Can't speak for the pregnancy tests yet, as the ovulation tests have not worked well. Sure, you get a lot of tests for your money, buy spend a little more money for a better test and you'll be glad you saved yourself the aggravation.Also, even though it is shown, there is no such pink ""baby time"" booklet. The free booklet - ""Vital Information You Must Know if You Want to Maximize Your Chances of Getting Pregnant Faster"" consists of a couple of photocopied pages, very poorly written. So if you're leaning towards this one for the extra booklet, don't bother. You can get better info online."
3,not sure if it works,"So far, I think this product is working as expected, except I may have missed my ovulation this month. I test twice a day & I always have a light line (even with more expensive brands), but I have not noticed any distinctively darker test lines, though it did seem like they got a little darker & lightened up again. Basically the test lines were never as dark or darker than the control line. The control lines have appeared each time so I am assuming the strips are working. Obviously, I cannot comment on the pregnacy tests! I think I might buy the tests from the store & use those along with these strips, and do my own little experiment. I got these as a cheaper alternative, but because I am trying to get pregnant, I may have to go the more expensive route - accuracy is important when you are trying to time these things! Good luck to others with this product."
3,Iffy,"These were shipped very quickly and were as described, except... the ""chart"" was the same single sheet of regular paper that you can find on the internet and print yourself, except it has been photocopied making it very hard to read. Also, I havent had a chance to ""test"" the opt's out, but the hpt's are very iffy. I was late this month and have used one a day for a week now. # have come out with very faint lines (yes pink lines not evap lines) and 4 have come out negative, and they have been alternating, so one day the tests say positive, the next negative. I ended up going and buying some different ones in the store, and am still waiting for AF... While I know that everyone is different, I dont see how any test can go back and forth like that, because our bodies dont do that. Either your preggo and producing the hormone or you arent. Just frustrating! Good luck to everyone who chooses to use these, and baby dust to everyone :o)"
2,MAY NOT WORK FOR ALL,I have been using these OPKs and HPTs for 2 months now and have NOT got my POSITIVE on OPKs.... i even used the OPks on my husband pee for 3 days test the OPKs bcz mine were all negative.. so after testing him for 3 days he had all negatives... a man has a LH hormone surge ever 24-48 hrs...dr said some men dont have a surge for 4 days but my hub never got a postive so maybe he is one that doesnt have a surge for 4 days...i have alot of friends who use similiar test and have success but with me i never a postive..my dr said all women have different levels of hormone i am one that is naturally lower so i need sensitive OPKs... my friend and i wanted to test the HPTs and she is 14 weeks preggo... took them but just found out today;when i was talking to her; those test she took were accurate! she didnt know but she ws loosing the baby when she used the HPTs...i dont wanna say these horrible but you get what you pay for...
3,A Nice Bunch of Kids...,"PC Quest was on the road doing a promotional tour for their record company around 1990-91. They visited WBWB-FM in Bloomington, Indiana (where I worked at the time) and impressed all of us with their confidence and talent. Imagine the young guys in the movie ""The Wonders"" - full of energy and excitement to be making music and dreaming big dreams. That was PC Quest.Was their music ground-breaking? No. Was it entertaining and did they have a lot of raw talent? Absolutely! After meeting a lot of stars during my 26 years in radio, PC Quest stands out as a nice, talented bunch of kids!"

5,Very Happy with mu purchase,"I am very happy with my purchase, the product was USED, but you would never know it. It's like new. I am extremely happy with it. I would definitely buy from this seller again."
4,love it!,i love this book; it has helped me in so many ways to become a better writer and teacher. i received this book in excellent condition just as the seller said it would be.
2,Real Writing,"The book itself is in great condition. Although, I was not informed that this product was the TEACHER'S ADDITION. I am a student and needed the student book. I am extremely dissatisfied."
3,Required Text,The book is required for my English class. It seems to be good for sentence and paragraph stucture!...Everything need for good writing!...Helpful in creating Essays!..
5,Just what I needed for College,"Got the book it was used, but that is how I bought it, but just because it was used doesn't mean it was bad, the pages were all inside and not no one wrote on it, it was a solid book I would give this seller 2 thumbs up and if I had a third arm I would give them three"
5,ODB Rises From the Dead to Hit Us Up Wit His Genius,"As if Return to the 36, N*gga Please, and Trials & Tribulations hadn't already solidified ODB as one of the GREATEST M.C's of ALL time...he hits us up with one of his most genius works yet...Osirus. This album brings so many elements of everything ancient and modern in the rap game. You will hear everything from kung fu clips, reminiscent of the Wu-Tang's classic albums, to Mozart's Requiem bein' mixed with a crazy ass beat in ""Fire."" He vocalizes like a pro, like the one and only original President MC, his dirtiness..Ol' Dirty Bastard at the top of his game (sadly pulled from us too early). This album caps off an incredible career of brutally honest lyricist who kept it too real for most, but not too real for his true Wu Bangin' fans! After all, we are all truly ""Buck naked in the Wu-Tang clothes""...OOooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. R.I.P. ODB..Keep it Real in Death."
5,Happy CD,This CD is one of the upbeat ones in my collection. It makes me want to get up and dance! I'd recommend this cd to everyone!!
2,Good effort but...,"Nina Gordon's career so far has been one that is quite far removed from Veruca Salt. Sure she has stayed within the ""rock"" sound but her brand of pop/rock is so overly glossy that it borders on Hilary Duff.Her lyrics are actually quite good but this album is very slow and never really picks up speed. I'm sure Louise Post and the rest of Veruca Salt will deliver a much better album seeing as the 2001 album and 2005 EP of Veruca Salt top anything that Gordon has put out in recent years.In all a retread of 2003 Liz Phair."
1,She's done.,"I have followed her for years, going back to early Veruca Salt. Her first solo album was good and hoped following albums would at least match it or get better. This album is just plain bad. I doubt if there is any chance for her to recover. She's done."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"Nina plays 4 standard chords each for an equal measure and says hey look I wrote a song, then she does it 10 more times and says look I wrote an album. Everyone clap for Nina's de-evolution as a pop composer."
2,Drained of life,"I have to 'fess I only listened to the samples, but what am I hearing - a lounge act? The music of VS, had feeling of life and an engaging energy. Now it is much more slick, & mainstream, but lacking the power to create any feeling of empathy. This CD is more like a bloodless corpse, than a bleeding heart."
2,Disappointing effort,"I really enjoyed her first solo album, and I was looking forward to hearing her new effort. Unfortunately, I just couldn't find one single song that I liked, even after repeated listenings. I appreciate the entire album, as she seems to have matured in her songwriting and production values. She's finally moved past being an Aimee Mann clone (on her first album) and gotten over being a former riot grrl (her career with Veruca Salt). However, she seems to have lost the sparkling pop sensibilities that were so in evidence in her past work."
2,I Wanted to Like it Better...............Honest,"This was the first full album I purchased from iTunes. And I did it w/out sampling one track. Shame on me. I liked 'Tonight and the Rest of My Life' so much, I figured, what the heck. Let's just say this: lesson learned.I thought 'TatRoML' was so good, that this review will almost seem hypocritical. What is the difference between her first solo disk and 'Bleeding Heart Graffiti'? They are seemingly so close in writing, production and execution that it's unnerving.That is not to say I don't enjoy Nina Gordon. ""Christmas Lights"", ""Kiss Me Til It Bleeds"" and ""Suffragette"" are pretty good songs. But they aren't radically different from anything else. Nor is the rest of the disk.I'm not sure who marginalized the music - Gordon, Bob Rock's production or the label. Personally, I would much rather hear the Ethan Johns produced disk that Gordon scrapped.Six years is a long time to wait for a disk that she essentially already released in 2000."
2,i'm in a bad way,I was pretty disapppointed with this album it just doesn't live up to Tonight and the Rest of My Life. I have to agree previous reviews Tonight and the Rest of My Life is one of my favorite albums. Bleeding Heart Graffiti has one or two good songs but the rest of the album just falls short.
2,I agree with reviewer Ettinger,"I also waited for this CD to release with baited breath because I LOVED her first solo CD, and so did my husband. It is always one of the disks we listen to on a road trip. BUT...this CD sounds exactly the same! Horse songs, etc. Maybe just different lyrics, but I also was shocked at my first listen. I heard nothing different from the first CD. Honestly, I also wanted to LOVE it, but haven't given it another listen since that first time."
2,Different and Disappointing,Very disappointed with the new album. After repeated listenings it still sounds like tortured elevator music. What happened since that dynamite first solo album? Let hope the next album will return her to glory.
5,Great!,I love this! I use it every night to fall asleep. It feels really soft and the smell is great.
1,Bugs!,"Initially I liked this product; however, I recently took it out of the box and it was filled with bugs! The pillow had holes with flax seeds coming out. I threw out the seeds, washed the eye pillow in hopes of refilling but cannot due to holes. What a disappointment!"
5,PERFECT! PERFECT! PERFECT!,"I made the mistake of washing my old eye pillow so I had to replace it. I bought this one and the red brocaded one and i was soooooo happy that I choose these! They are the perfect weight, perfect size, perfect scent and perfect price! Couldn't ask for better and so glad I bought two! One for home and one for travel! YEAH ME! :P"
4,Eye Pillow,"My husband got me this eye pillow from my wish list, I looove it, the only thing I do not like is the fact that it does not have elastic on it to slip over my head which would allow me to lay on my side and not just my back. So I am going to have to add my own elastic....."
5,We all sleep better,"The eye pillow is a real hit with our family. We ordered one for everyone and they are all being used with great success. These pillows are designed well, not too heavy pressure on face and have a nice lavender scent."
3,Ok Item,I bought this as a gift item for girl friend and haven't heard anything bad about this product from that person.
5,Awesome!,I love this eye pillow. It smells heavenly & is extra long! Highly recommend this eye pillow! I use it for my yoga class.
4,aroma therapy,"Love this little pillow. It smells heavenly. It's lightweight and fits easily across the forehead or over the eyes and is very relaxing to use, especially for headaches. A great feature is that, with the zipper, the contents can be removed and the ""pillow case"" can be washed. Also the contents can be refreshed with some lavender essential oil, or other fragrant essential oil. So it's quite easy to keep the fragrance going when it starts to fade. Put the whole pillow into a ziplock plastic bag and freeze it for an extra cooling effect."
4,Good Eye Pillow,It works for what I need it to do. I used to wear an eye mask but I like how this just falls off when I get to sleep. Haven't tried cooling it yet but that would be nice with a headache...
2,Nice but Don't Use if Allergic to Chamomile,"First of all, I ordered this sage one, but got a silky burgundy dragonfly one. Second, I failed to read that it contained chamomile, which I am highly allergic to. Chamomile is part of the ragweed family, so if you have seasonal pollen allergies, beware of this product. Other than that, it was nicely made and eye pillows are wonderful (I have others). It needed to be packaged airtight so scent would last. Because of the packaging, it barely had a scent at all."
5,best amazon purchase ever,"I lost an eye pillow a few years ago and couldn't find a decent one at retail. I was nervous about the ""lavender"" scent. While the scent was a little strong initially it did mellow out fairly soon. One side of the pillow is silk or satin and smooth. It remains cool, but can slip off your face easily.The other side is velvet or velour. It is slightly warmer, but still cool. It also stays on your face better without requiring elastic. I absolutely LOVE this item. It has helped me to many great nights of sleep.If you have any doubts, forget them this is great."
3,Not too hot,"This did not seem to work very well. It never registered above 150 degrees, even though I tried placing it on several different places on the stove and door. I had the stove fulled fired up but still this did not show a reasonable measurement.I now have a fireplace insert that I will light up this fall and try it on that one."
5,"Nice looking gage, accurate",I've compared the temp from this gage with a handheld IR thermometer and found it to be very accurate. Looks good and works well - enough said.
2,just pretty,"This thermometer works fine, but in the attempt to make it pretty, the lettering is dull and you can't read it very well."
4,A VERY INTERESTING READ,"I gave this work four star because I felt the first half deserved five stars but the second half only three..ergo, I split the difference. The author has done some wonderful research into the oil industry and the evils there-in. I learned much from the first portion of the book. It was very well written, had lots of good facts, and while not completely comprehensive, did give a great overview. On the other hand, the last part of the book was a simple rant on the author's part. While I might agree with most of what he said, It has to be noted that it has been said before, over and over and over again. It was like reading a ""George Bush and Big Oil and the U.S. sucks"" manifesto. Yada, yada, yada...it is getting a bit old. Other than that, I certainly recommend it and it is certainly one you will want to read."
4,Good Primer,"Like other reviewers, I found the first half an interesting history lesson about how we got to where we are concerning our dependence on oil. The remaining narrative about the abuses of the oil industry were disturbing. It will lead me to other sources and make me wonder about the morality of those leading this industry. In any event, it should be a must read for the entire family. Everyone's children should at least know the history behind the most important product on the planet. God only knows if they teach them at school!"
3,"Starts Good, Ends Lacking","The author did very well in the first half of the book giving the reader the historical context of oil. It's my opinion Americans are God-awful with history, or why things are the way things are. Though the book isn't billed as the ""be-all-end-all"" book on the history of oil, it started out as a time-condensed read on the subject; I enjoyed that.But then the author dropped into activism. Claims and projections are made without much practical data. Rosy futures are painted in wide swaths without an mention of practical technologies or means to getting to the final destination. I skipped many pages in the second half."
3,Pedal covers,"Everything was awesome on this product until it happened... what I am calling, the relay, blew, so I do not have the ability to brighten the glow, only stays at a dim look..."
3,Works but.......,This product is okay and does work but not as long as it says which is 12 hrs with a dime size amount which is recommended. The cost is excellent but this product dries you out. You have no natural lubrication and has a gritty feel to it. Using a lubricant seems to loosen the effects some.
5,"At long last, a treasure found","For true Nancy Wilson fans, there is no better reward for our patience than the discovery of a vintage pearl from the vaults of Nancy Wilson master tapes. I bought my first CD of any kind in 1984, and I've been searching for ""The Nancy Wilson Show"" since that time. This live performance is legendary for Ms. Wilson's voice, arrangements and deft delivery. You'll find the ultimate versions of ""You Can Have Him"" and ""Guess Who I Saw Today?,"" but ""The Music That Makes Me Dance"" is also a show stopper. After I purchased the CD, I loaded it onto my MP3 player as one whole recording, not wishing to slice and dice it. The entire recording should be experienced the way it was that night at the Cocoanut Grove. They've limited me to 5 Stars, but never has each star carried so much weight."
2,A CURIOSITY PIECE,"Not one of Cronberg's best, the film has curiosity value if only for starring a young Marylin Chambers, the world's most well know and perhaps best porn star. She shows that she could have made it as a legit actress, if only in small roles"
1,movies have come a long way.,"Just skip this one. It's not worth it. This is one where nostalgia gets mixed with opinion, IMO."
4,Good depraved trash,"""Rabid"" is an above average horror film by David Cronenberg. Yes, the same director who brings his horror affinity to mainstream titles like ""A History of Violence"" and ""Eastern Promises."" Cronenberg is a master of horror, and it surprises me that Hollywood plagiarists (er, re-envisionists) haven't remade any of his films yet (if they remake ""Scanners"" I hope their heads explode). Cronenberg's 70's films were labeled pornography at the time, as ""Shivers"" brought us a murder-sex plague and ""Rabid"" followed it by casting an adult film actress. ""Rabid"" is more of a demon possession/rabies hybrid, surely influencing more recent films like ""28 Days Later"" and ""Quarantine."" His 70's style was more horror-oriented, while his 80's style incorporated science-fiction - but always disgusting and dehumanizing. ""Rabid"" is nowhere near the director's best but definitely a fine prelude to future mastery."
3,early Cronenberg thriller from 1976..,"well.....after a motorcycle indicident in which a woman suffers severe injuries she is rushed to a hospital and receives an operation that makes her rabid (or something like that; I couldn't figure it out-- perhaps she received a tainted blood transfusion?)..she begins to infect others in the greater Montreal area. Police and authorities try to contain the plague by killing the carriers of the virus.With a bigger budget, the movie could have had a broader scope in the script, but (given the small budget), it is an effective thriller.The movie pre-dates the AIDS crisis by some 15 years, but it is almost prophetic in showing how a virus can spread and infect others on a mass scale.The film hi-lights Cronenberg's attraction to medicine and disease, which you'll find as a theme in a lot of his films.** recommended for existing Cronenberg fans **"
3,A Troubling Horror Story...,"Rose recovers while in a coma in a small hospital for plastic surgery after a motorcycle accident where she has had a groundbreaking emergency operation. When Rose wakes up she finds herself having frantic desires for human blood. Unknowingly Rose infects everyone she comes in contact with as she consumes their blood with a frightening blood-borne disease that rapidly spreads among the human population. Rabid carries Cronenberg's insignia as it displays a troubling story concerning science, which offers a decent cinematic experience for those who seek horror."
3,eccentric,"a modern vampire story, also an epidemic started by the girl ""marily chambers"" who suddenly and as far as I remember without any cause transfers to a woman who can suck blood through a needle in her armpit, and also communicates a disease that is similar to rabies, whoever she sucks the blood, turns out to be a vicious creature who want to kill and bite...a cult movie of its own kind.. nice for a young marilyn chambers character. 3 stars because of the eccentricity, and some killing scenes I still remember, like a pneumatic hammer through a car door..and wet scenes of marilyn in a 'chamber'"
1,Waste of money,"I should have just thrown my money away rather than purchase this product. After only one use, the handle broke. This is a very flimsy product, the suction is terrible, and the only way to get it fixed was to send it away, get it repaired, and send it back. Rather than waste any more time or money on it, I just tossed it and bought one from a different brand."
3,Interesting DVD,"As an avid fan of Oscar Peterson, this is a disc that you should buy.The musical setting is at a nightclub in Chicago and is first class, A+++.However, the detracting part of the program is the frequently interruption to the flow of the music by commentary on his life.If you want to know about the life of an artist, buy the book!"
1,Boring!,"This book is very dull and plain. It has no spells, charms, and true wicca. It just has pictures of stuff."
1,Very plain and boring.,"I didn't like this book that much because it was boring, and it didn't really tell that much. This book was very plain and only had pictures of things."
3,promising....,"admittedly, i write this review after listening to Gary Numan's lastest work ""Pure"", so i may be biased. Exile is a 'good' album, in which Gary refocuses on refining dark elements and chord structures as he had on ealier 80's work. Songs like 'Prophecy' and 'Dark' are brooding, clever, and distinct. However, if you don't own any of Numan's last three CDs, ""Pure"" is the one to buy, as it is better produced and more unique than his previous two. Then again, ""Exile"" does have that neat 'dagger-like' symbol on it :)"
3,"A Step Down, But Powerful","Gary Numan has apparently gotten his second wind after the critical success of SACRIFICE. This album continues more or less in that mold, with heavier emphasis on religion. Perhaps too much - with all the songs taking some sort of anti-Christian lyrical stance (excepting the killer track ""Absolution""), the songs start to run together by the end of the album. Still, a worthwhile addition to the Numan repetoire."
3,A new depth of darkness,"Gary Numan seems determined to head down the Nine Inch Nails/Marilyn Manson road of music. This isn't bad except when you consider the peppy, challenging mode of his earlier albums. Dripping with denial of God and steeped in despair, he has possibly reached the point where some of his older fans are going to get off the bus and look elsewhere for music. Compared to ""Jagged"", this album is almost comical in its insistence that noone is more neglected by the Creator, more caught in a dead-end depression and is more bent on ruining anyone who crosses him.For those who swim in the deep end of the Goth pool, this a great album which is musically strong and carries on the development of Garys talents. But if your notion of his music is Tubeway Army stuff or even the heavier riffs of ""Jagged"", you may be disappointed in this one."
4,A step forward for Gloomin' Numan,"There is little I can say about this album that has not been said already, it is a huge departure from the sort of music Gary Numan wrote in the late 70s - early 80s but to me that isn't a detraction in anyway at all. Exile is an extremely dark album, religion being the predominant focus where the angle being taken is a cynical doubt shown towards the benevolence of God. Personally I think it's fantastic and although several of the tracks become a tad repetitive, this serves to strengthen the cohesiveness of the album as a whole. Whilst it's not the sort of music you'd be playing at a dance party its very introspective if you're in the right mood it can be fantastic. Probably more esoteric than most albums around, and certainly not for everyone but I found Exile to be a big step forward for Gary Numan definitely and worth the $30 odd I paid for it."
5,Like walking in the clouds....,Clark's rule....once you get a pair....you can't imagine wearing anything else. This shoe looks good and feels great....
4,clogs made for comfort,"These clogs almost did not get to me due to confusing tracking information. I was so glad that they did arrive and they were truly very comfortable and well made. However, the leather was kind of stiff that's why I only put a 4 stars. Overall, I'm happy with them and Clarks shoes always fit me very well."
5,Batman Joker Justice T-Shirt,Product arrived in excellent condition just a few days after I ordered it. The recipient of this gift was well pleased with the quality of the material as well as the silk-screening. Excellent
1,Never Received,"I can't review the product because I never received it. I tried contacting the company and I promptly received a condescending response. In general, the response was find the missing t-shirt myself. If you can afford to lose 20 plus bucks in the current economy, then I recommend you take a chance and order it. As for me, I've chalked it up to a loss and lesson learned."
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES!,"This movie is awsome. I loved it. When I bought it, I couldn't stop watching it. You must buy this movie and the soundtrack."
4,great movie,"i don't care what you say, it's a great movie. it's not suburbia (but no other punk film is) but it has some good performances on behalf of many of the main characters. some scenes are over-acted (mainly Bob and Steve-o talking about how you gotta have a home). so teeny-bopper to hardcore punk, you can enjoy this film. (teeny-bopper punk. that's an oxymoron)"
5,Greatest Ever,"This movie, as other people may have said, starts out telling a story, but ends up being a dramatic spiral of events. Its about two anarchist punks who live in Salt Lake City. They are rebeling against society. The movie starts with Bob and Stevo as hardcore, die-hard punks. Over the course of the movie they come to realize that rebelion is not dressing up like a bum and dying your hair blue, but instead you just are rebellious. They try to rebel by wasting their educated minds. This is when he realizes that he was nothing more then a trendy posuer. He also realizes that you can do a lot more damage from inside the system then by sitting on your butt wasting your educated mind not making any money."
1,THIS MOVIE IS GARBAGE!,"SLC Punk is a complete waste of time and talent. Matthew Lillard gives a really good performance as an anarchist going through some major life changes, but the rest of this film is a waste. Way too much hokey philosophy and hackneyed visual shots by a third rate cinematographer. The soundtrack is great--Sex Pistols, Fugazi, Specials, even a little Rush at the end. But Heroin Bob played by Goorjian is completely overacted and ridiculous, he ruins every scene he is in with his inadequacies. One other thing, will someone please get the acid trip right. The director of this film has chosen to go the traditional Easy Rider acid trip route which is a total wreck. I'd love to see just once an accurate portrayal of LSD consumption on the big screen (check out Fear and Loathing). This movie is for posers, I caught it on HBO at 2:00 in the morning so luckily I didn't waste any cash on it. But if your into a mindless story with an aimless plot that leads nowhere then check out SLC Punk."
1,this movie totally sucks...,honestly the only good part was deven sawa sp? he kicked a** and was so funny!! honestly watch the two scenes with him only the rest of the movie not worthy watching.
1,For any wannabe punker,"this movie is really horriable.it is for any one who latches on the that fake punk scene.With there ""punk is not only music its a state of mind""Its notand the movie is about of bunch of dumb kids doing stupid stuff.don't waste your time or money"
5,this film rocks,this is probably the best punk movie ive ever seen. it shows that punk isnt anything about what you where its all about what you believe in. it shows what posers are and what anarchist are and everything else about punk. i havent bought this movie but i will.
2,It started out pretty good.,"SLC Punk wasn't a totally bad film. It started out quite good and held my interest for about an hour or so. The script was really thought-provoking for a while and some of the scenes (especially when the guy's talking to his parents) were really funny. Near the end of the movie, everything just got bizarre and it lost me. On another note, the acting was actually better-than-good. That aside, I found SLC Punk to be quite disappointing (especially since it started out so well, but then took a strange turn). This film was between risky and satisfying. Had a lot of potential. I actually rate it 2.5 stars."
4,Just a TAD too much angst and rage.,"I don't care who you are, you are going to cry during this movie. Tears of laughter, and definitely tears of sadness; especially at the end. Bascially about two punks growing up in Salt Lake City, smack dab in the middle of Mormon headquarters; and dealing with their daily criticism, and how they see the world. The movie can actually help you learn a bit about yourself, anarchy, and how the world relaly works. Finally, a movie with a little truth to it. Matthew Lillard gives his best performance to date in the flick; and that's no lie! A must see."
4,Good movie. Worth watching.,"This is a good movie. It's pretty good and the drug scenes might give you flashbacks. This isn't Trainspotting...this is the neighborhood punks who later became computer programmers, television producers, etc. You'll be disappointed if you are looking for a movie about the hard life punks...these kids have problems but it's hard to have too many problems when you live in a big house, parents give you money and food, and get school paid for. This movie is about rebeling even when you aren't down and out.Interesting and a pretty good film showing that even in Utah you can rebel. Even if for only a little bit."
3,pretty unexpected,"I have not seen much of Matthew Lilliard, but as an Adam Pascal fan I wanted to see this... it was really a good alternative movie! Matthew Lilliard is very natural and believable, and Michael G. is also excellent. There were so many quirky smaller characters that the movie was very colorful all the way through (not just the hair..). I didn't feel like there were enough ""turning point"" scenes until the end of the movie; if they had inserted a few other key moments I think the audience would have been more invested in Matthew's character. But the movie was the perfect Sundance movie."
2,Not a great one,eh poser movie.not really too many good punk bands and wtf's ECP fck off and die? oh i said fck off im punk now oohoo
5,This really is a good movie,"I went through many phases of opinions of SLC Punk. The first was love. I loved this movie because I love punk rock and the punk lifestyle, and I loved the political messages and fighting and cussing and all that good stuff. After that phase came a phase of hate. I realized that the movie was ""for posers"" because it was innacurate about the punk lifestyle. I thought of it as stupid and immature and didn't watch it until about a month ago. When I saw it again, a new phase of love kicked in. I realized that in order to enjoy this movie, you can't look at it as a movie about punks, because that's not what it's about. It's really about growing up and the changes it brings. It's a movie about questioning yourself and finding out who you are. It's a beatuiful portrayal of human situations such as loss, conflictions, and confusion. But it's also a movie about happiness and how you find it. I don't think I'll be leaving this phase too soon..."
5,Destined to be a classic,"SLC Punk reminds me of my own youth growing up in the 70s and 80s in Salt Lake City, Utah. This movie epitomizes the struggle that all youth go through when facing life's challenges and will be easy for anyone to identify with even if they didn't grow up in Salt Lake like I did. It's a classic!"
3,overstereotypes punks,"This movie looks like an MTV produced video concentrating on just how cynical and violent punk rockers are , not to mention the main character a rich college boy with blue hair. This film tries to say all punks do is drink beer , smoke pot , and beat up rednecks. Plus Stev-O rambles on and on and on about anarchy and rebellion . Can someone please tell me just what he was being so rebellious against? or just what anarchist principles did he hold?. It is a good film to sit down and watch , discuss , and laugh at , but it really does nothing more than streotype punks ..also it jerks your emotions around constantly from a funny satire , to an emotional study of self discovery. In the end Steve-O becomes what he complains about through the whole film..nothing more than a poser all along ..at least he admitted it."
3,Yes its true trainspotting without the drugs!,This movie goes all over the place but I think thats the point ofit all.good performances and nice music make this dvd worth it.Enjoyable and funny commentary also.Another little indie gem worth experiencing!!recommended.
1,Lunk-headed look at punk,"Horrible movie. This movie's representation of 80's punk rock is really a film about jocks-in-punks clothing masquerading as the real thing. This totally [disappoints] in my punk-since-1980 opinion - but I'm sure all the empty-headed trendy ""punks"" of today that shop at Hot Topic will adore this movie - it feeds the punk stereotype for stupidity and violence that sadly ruined the early punk rock scene in the first place."
2,stupid!,i gave this movie two stars for the great soundtrack and that's the only good thing about this! this film blows so damn much.i listen to punk hang out with punk and i am a damn punk and this movie makes punks look like burnout hippies! matthew lillard funny but not in this film! i hate that he says the word poser in every sentence he says.and i really hate the ending where he decides that he doesn't want to be a punk anymore and becomes a little smart rich boy that he should have always been but he needed to dress punk to fit in! this is a punk movie for the green day/offspring corprate punks that think they are all that and punk is a fashion! i'll stick to the 1983 classic suburbia-a real movie that shows what punks are all about!
3,anarchy for sale!,"The stereotypical punk.Entertaining...yes...Accurate...no.It leaves you to the misconception that all punks wear gloves and write ""anarchy"" all over the walls.They tell you that anarchy is ""chaos"".Anarchy is defined as ""absence of government"".It's a mockery to true anarchists.But hey,when you don't put the thought into it,it is entertaining."
4,"Teenage Angst, and Coming of Age","First of SLC punk isn't really about punk rock, its about being a punk. Not in the mohawk being too cool for school sort of way, but rather the not knowing where you want to go, what you want to do, and not sure about society sort of way.The brilliant thing about this movie is that it captures teenage angst, the way punk rock as a form of music captures teenage angst. For anyone who has lived the suburban life this movie will seak volumes about you, volumes you may not even realize. The thing that speaks to me more than anything else in particular is the idea of doing something esle with your life, and punk being a phase of growing up. At least the posing and posturing being a phase. While you may leave part of the subculture behind, it is a part of you, and someything that you will never lose, even when you are working in an office someplace in chicago."
5,the Dead Culture,"SLC Punk. I read a few reviews that said that the movie didnt have a plot. IT DOES! Its about teenage angst, rebellion, and reality. Throughout the movie we see Stevo's character evolve from a hardcore punk, to an ""open minded"" yuppi. I guess people say it doesnt have a plot line because they dont understand what the Dead Culture is all about, they think punk is Blink 182 singing all about fart jokes. Punk in essence is a political statement to all the oldschool fascist closed minded people in power. And thats what this movie portrays. Not only that the soundtrack is supeb it contains songs from when punk still had integrity (featuring the Dead Kennedys). Is it worth your money? Hell YEAH! Get it, get the soundtrack. But dont try to analyze it, just absorb the sincerity and realism of failed youths in a very concervative Salt Lake City."
4,great movie,"this movie was entertaining and made me think. good storyline, good music, it was good all around. matthew lillard makes a great bluehaired babe in this movie. my friends and i made comparisons to the characters in the movie and real life punks we know. pretty close in the way of thinking and dressing. i recommend this movie to anyone."
2,"overrated, ...","All you supposed ""cinephiles"" who think this qualifies as an even halfway decent film are fooling yourselves. SLC Punk is a steaming pile of ... Its a very outsider look at punk culture, regardless of what the director would have you believe on the commentary. My criticism isn't even so much that I disagree with the film's message (I'm not THAT unfair). What we have here, quite simply, is a very poorly made film. Everywhere you look there are lights and microphones in the shot, the characters are very poorly drawn, there is no shortage of pretentious dialogue that sounds like it was written by some depressed kid in high school, and the acting is UNBELIEVABLY bad(excepting a few bit parts). I realize that the film is done with a ""punk"" ideology in mind, but if that were the case, the director/writer obviously knows nothing about the punk scene, other than the fact that its vapid and lame. SLC Punk is a poor excuse for a movie."
3,jayhawk,I am unable to rate this product as it was a gift for another person . I have not actually watched this video so it is really hard to rate and review. My Grandson says it is great and he would recommed purchasing this item.
2,problem,good movie. glad i found it on amazon. but i expected to have the 'leather vest' thing around it like in the pictures. I'm dssappointed about that. i could have gotten it cheaper somewhere else.
3,descent movie,"This movie is ok, not gonna win any awards. There is a lot of talk about punk posers in this movie. This is not about real punk rock. Which is fitting, because it's about posers. It's entertaining nonetheless."
3,passing of the real SLC punk,"The film was OK, not a totally accurate representation of the Salt Lake post Punk and Hardcore scenes, but a nice homage. anyway of more not. The local Salt Lake legend Sean Fightmaster, who the acid gobbling crazed character in the film was loosely based on. Passed away in December. He was punk rock up until the last."
5,Great Film,"This is a great film , with a great soundtrack , with fine acting , and insight into the punk lifestyle. At first I didn't buy it. I was disgusted with the characters just sitting around , doing as many drugs as possible , and fighting ( sterotypes ) right down to the fashions. But at the end of the film it i realized it was all planned. And i am glad that we have a movie like this. Only complaint: I wish they could have gotten somebody besides Matt Lillard because that guy ..... me off."
4,pretty good movie,if you dont have this video in your library then you should buy it. i watch it every once in a while and still find it funny. some of it can be deep thinking but over all is a comedy and good movie.
5,don't judge a movie by its trailer,"This is a great movie, but its trailer doesn't even come close to doing it justice, so don't bother watching that."
3,"Fun, but really conservative in punk drag...","""SLC Punk"" is a shallow good time disguised as a sociological study. While seeming to laude the tenets of both anarchy and punk rock, the film is profoundly conservative and insulting once you dig a little deeper beneath the surface. Lillard is great, even during the obnoxious ""speaking-directly-to-the-camera"" portions, but what stands out is an underlying contempt for both punk specifically, and rebellion generally. ""I didn't sell out, I bought in."" That perhaps best sums up the sensibility behind ""SLC Punk."" Turn off your brain and it's all cool -- otherwise, you will want to hunt down and kill James Merendino."
2,What crap!,Looks like the mundanes are trying to explain why freaks are not like them. Feels like it was written by a hippie turned yuppie to justify to his conscience why he sold out. See Suburbia instead.
5,Soca Gold does it again!,"Soca Gold is the best compilation each year and this is no exception. It is impossible to put every single soca tune on one compilation, but this one does the best job. If you only buy one 99 soca CD, this is the one to buy! Otherwise be sure to pick up Square One ""In Full Bloom"" as well as Machel Montano/ Xtatik ""Any Minute Now"" as well!"
2,Didn't work for me,I generally like twisted movies and this one certainly had an interesting concept. That said the dialog and acting were pretty flat and the movie didn't hold my interest. I give it some pluses for the unexpected ending but that didn't really redeem the rest of the film.
1,Je ne comprends pas.,"Je ne comprends pas l'engoument du public pour ""Le Decor"" de Stefie Shock. Loin d'y etre innovateur, il nous bassine tout au long de l'album de musique de fanfare ou de gros pop repetitif. Pourquoi le range-t-on generalement dans la categorie des rockeurs? Ca m'echappe. Cote paroles, on sent qu'il peine a sortir ses rimes et ses images sont plutot classiques. Rien qui fasse etrangement vibrer. Peut-etre a cours d'inspiration, il a meme cru bon de reprendre ""Pas assez de toi"" du groupe ""La Mano Negra"". Plate reprise a mon avis, loin de la rage sincere de la version originale. Comment ce produit de la pub mediatique massive est-il devenu ""cool"" parmi un public soit-disant selectif, voire elitiste? Comprends pas, mais alors pas du tout. Seul point fort: la choriste Suzie Mc Lellan a vraiment une jolie voix qui contraste parfaitement avec les paroles plus dites que chantees par l'auteur-compositeur-interprete."
2,Save me....,"Being in the copyright profession I have read numerous copyright and IP related books and this one is the worst one I have ever suffered through. I actually had Moser as a professor in college and thought I would give his book a try. I'm not sure why since every student hated his class with a passion. But I figured surely his book would be somewhat better.....I was wrong. This book is no different than most of what is out there. It gives no new perspective, just rehashes the same old same old we have been hearing about for years. I had a hard time with this book keeping my attention. If you are completely new to copyright and IP one could benefit, but I think there are other books out there that are easier to read and give a great overview. If you are an IP ""scholar"" skip it completely. You will be bored to tears."
2,Decent pop metal,"21 Guns is Scott Gorham's band. The former guitar player of Thin Lizzy isn't following the Lizzy tradition at all. This album from 1992 is mostly pop metal in a very time typical way. Some of the songs are rather attractive but the singer have a limited high pitch voice with a clear lack of power. Those of you who like Phenomena's third release ""Inner vision"" will most likely go crazy over this album."
3,Cover Art,I personally asked the cover artist whom he had modeled the illustration of the title character on. He sighed and told me that many people had asked him that question but that he had made up the figure from scratch and that it was not based on any real woman. Sigh...
2,The beginning of the end of RAH,"I just re-read Friday, and confirmed it as the beginning of the end for Mr. Heinlein.He takes on a very difficult topic - bigotry - and does a poor job of dissecting it for discussion while blasting the reader with his grandstanding opinions.Like most of his later work, he starts with an interesting plot develops it to the point of grabbing significant reader interest and then seems to get bored and moves on to another topic.As with all of his later stuff, his free-love/sex message comes through loud and clear which takes his attention from developing more of the plot and characters.In the end, the book just kind of peters out and really never finishes."
3,"memorable character, aimless plot","The first-person protagonist is memorable, but what is the point of the narrative?"
3,"The 50s, James Bond, and Sex and the City all smashed up","This was a pretty enjoyable read for the old-school sci-fi fan. The story is pretty neat, but the characters are just plain weird at times. You feel like you're watching one of those 50s movies where everyone talks in that American accent with an almost British crispness and everyone is always saying witty things. There are references in here, random quotes in foreign languages and such, that I didn't get for months. And Heinlein clearly put a good bit of his fantasies into Friday, she being the super-hot and horny being with powers testing the limits of what could be defined as human. I paid too much for this book at my local store, purchasing the full-sized paperback, but the mass market size may be worth picking up if you like science fiction from that era."
4,"Great fun, but has not aged well","[Warning, I am a self-confessed Heinlein fan <grin>!]As I get older, I find more and more that I enjoy Heinlein's juveniles and early novels more than his later ones. I think the main reason for this is that my view of women drifts farther and farther from the one presented in the novels.I think that in today's environment of sexual equality (and increasingly, sexual *equivalence*) RAH's novels do not play well to a general audience. When I was younger, I fell in love with any number of red-headed, Heinlein heroines but I feel uncomfortable re-reading some of these books today.Of course, that perhaps indicates only that I don't enjoy opinions differing too much from my own or that I am just a follower of prevailing opinion, but I feel that for example, _The Puppet-Masters_ offers just as good adventure without the sexual element intruding so much."
3,A great yet sidetracked idea.,"In this book, Robert Heinlein does a nice job or portraying the plight and alienation felt by those who are different from what is considered ""normal"", in this case an android female. While the protagonist's ongoing search for her own identity and a place she can call her own are indeed compelling, the narrative is, unfortunately, sidetracked by her seemingly endless sexual escapades, which detract from the main character's appeal and needlessly distract the reader. While it can be argued, with good reason, that her almost single-minded focus on sex is an integral part of her quest for self-discovery, it can get tiresome for those who expect a more ""serious"" approach. Altogether a good, but not a great selection from the Master himself."
3,Meandering and less idea-filled,"I have read 3 Heinlein books, Stranger In A Strange Land, Farnham's Freehold, and Friday. Both of the others were much more interesting to me for their ideas, and their plots seemed much tighter as well. Friday was OK; the other two are truly great reads."
5,One of the best RAH books...,"I'm a big fan of RAH, and this is one of my two favorite books of his. Friday is one of the most compelling protagonists ever put on paper, and her cunning contrasts perfectly with her naivete (sp?) in regards to human reasoning. An absolute must have for any SF fan."
1,Not Free SF Reader,"This book is bad in just so many ways. By far the worst thing he ever came up with. Just horrible. 'What if I had a super girl android servant I could send on missions, and she loved sex whenever andhowever, and I could get lots of the details afterwards.'If you want something that is similar, but actually decent, try Joel Shepherd's Cassandra Kresnov series, Crossover, Breakaway, Killswitch."
1,Capable women coping w/a difficult world ****,"As a friend, aunt to my daughter, or fellow rigger in any theater or concert hall or arena , Friday is an exemplary woman.Not only does she have augmented phyisical resources, but also well rounded emotional & smarts as well.Brittney can go fishing w/Friday anytime. love dad."
3,Interesting premise wasted,"I've read every book Heinlein ever wrote. After the middle sixties, I started asking myself why. In spite of his undoubted storytelling ability, his ideology began to take center stage.Friday is a genentically enhanced female (watch Dark Angel to see it done better) who resembles nothing more than a lost pup looking for a pat instead of a kick. She gets kicked more often than not.Heinlein's narrative skills are as good as ever, but the book seems to have no point other than to preach sex, sex, SEX! For really good SF, read the earlier, ""juvenile"" Heinlein, who was not juvenile at all."
5,"Sophisticated, brilliant - and that's just the narrative","Friday as a character is captivating, stamped with Heinlein's traditional humorous and realistic views. He also brings us into Friday's plight as she forces others to see her as a person, not an artificial one. While she remains loving - ""the coldest circle of hell is reserved for those who abandon kittens"" - her profession takes her into dangers which she handles with smooth precision. Pure Heinlein, purely fantastic. Love it."
5,Friday,"I enjoyed this book, and I think you will too if you read it. It's about a genetically engineered courier who is called an artifical person. It raises questions in the reader's mind that are becoming increasingly important as scientists today are now unraveling the secrets of the human genome. Genetic engineering will lead to many ethical issues that as a society we will need to resolve. Ahead of its time, this book deals with how these issues affect one particular ""person"" named Friday."
5,Best Heinlein book ever!,"This is one of the best books that Heinlein ever made! It has everything you want in our fast paced political times. Heroism, murder, survival, racist issues, over pop issues and many more. Enjoy!"
4,You keep missing the point,"Friday was Heinlein's comment on Apartheid. The fact that APs were non-persons is analogous to the status of blacks, coloreds and asians in South Africa. Just as Starship Troopers is aabout patriotism and the responsibility of citizenship."
5,Scotch-Brite Disposable Toilet Scrubber Refills,"Great scrubber, and they are disposable. No more dealing with a brush or scrubber you have to store...just the handle you slip the refill onto, and then off when you are through."
5,Works better than other brands,"We've found these to work very well, especially at getting to hard to reach spaces. They're easy to use and disposal is hands-free. Hard to find in stores."
4,Works as advertised,"Simple enough instalation. Takes about 20 minutes total including prep work. It works as described. I gave it four stars since I feel that it seems a litle cheap for the price, but it is exactly what I needed and it works well."

3,A good intro to the world of Numan if you're a techno fan.,"'The Mix' is obviously aimed at the people who heard that Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails, Beck, Hole and Weezer like Gary Numan. It's much better than the failed experiment that the vocals were lifted from called 'Techno Army', but isn't all that interesting if you aren't a fan of techno music. The tracks really aren't all that bad; Leather Strip, Transmutator, Anubian Lights, Information Society and Astralasia did a GREAT JOB; but in most cases the originals are MUCH better. Numan addicts and techno fans who want to find out more about Gary should pick the CD up, but the regular public can (and probably will) pass it over."
4,Great Book!!!!!!!,"This book is a great book!! And if you enjoyed Bruce Covilles ""Into the Land Of the Unicorns"" (Book one) you will enjoy this book as well!!"
3,CHAMPION Neoprene Ankle Wrap Adjustable by Champion,The size could have been larger. The one size fits all was not as good if it was sized large and extra large. It fitted ok when the ankle was normal but once swollen it was hard to get it to fit. I have use other brand and I prefer my old ones.
2,"Don't buy this, there are better out there!!!","I bought this in anticipation of improving my cycling technique this winter and was extremely disappointed. The first workout consisted of 4 one minute spin ups and 2 x 2minutes of one leg drills for each side. That was it and it was a 45 minute workout. Besides that you just pedaled. The commentary which which was sparse and unrehearsed was like listening to a Sunday pastor on prozac. If you want better, look into Spinervals recovery and technique."
2,Bosch whatever,"This is not a Bosch product officially at all. I found the official product in stores with shipping it's the same here as the stores. Ceteris paribus. The bosch version is weighs more, is much more refined, genuine Bosch, and I want a refund because this product its not as advertised. Imitation knock off. However, it still pounds."
1,Bosch plus point chisel,My thoughts are it is not a Bosch product. Every Bosch product I've ever purchased has Bosch stamped on the bit this one does not.With that understanding I cannot review this product as a Bosch chisel.
5,An Excellent Overview!,"A short but concise primer to Theosophy and a great place for all beginning students to learn. Understandable, cogent, and astute explanations of not so easy to understand principles. A worthy read!"
5,the best cuts sparkle,"Many of the cuts on this CD are fabulous. My favorite rendition of Guys and Dolls. She likes to do ALL the lyrics and it makes songs more fun. The others listed artists bought tend to be more jazz like (Patrica Barber, Karrin Allyson,Diana Krall) are not nearly so Broadway like and IMHO not nearly as good as Susannah McCorkle. I love ""friend like me"" (from Aladin). Fun to listen to."
2,Illaby,"The only reason I had to buy the whole CD is because I could not download the only song that I liked, which is Illaby, I still love the song, I didn't know it had and ending of about five minutes with no sound, and then some type or orchestral sounds; but I still like the song. This song I heard it playing it in the show ""criminal Minds"". Thank you. Marta Burgess"
1,Too big and bad quality,"First of all, this belt if HUGE. On the very last notch (tightest notch) it is so wide it is barely working for my 37 inch waist. If you are a smaller woman this will not work for you at all. I'm not sure who this is for but you would have to be huge for this to work for you.Also quality of this belt is very bad. It is not one solid piece but 3 pieces sawed together. So it started to tears where the seams are. Very bad product do not recommend."
1,Don't get it.,"I got this b/c i'm trying to lose weight and maybe this would help lose water weight and at least slim me up some. Very wrong. This is for people who are looking to slim up and how are very much in shape. The inside however helped me sweat more and I lost a couple of pounds; that was it. After I washed it carefully the first time, it never regained it shape. Also if you put it on too tight it just makes you look fatter. You could have just a bit of belly fat or muffin tops that aren't that serious and this thing will make you look worse. A gym membership or running on your own would fix any problems long term. This is for immedate coverage which wasn't good at all."
4,buy it if you want to,"i have no complains about this product but if you have an overhanging gut, you might find the slimmer belt too short for you. it will most likely go all the way around your stomach but might not cover it"
3,"Ok, but was expecting more","I was really excited about this product. I have a similar item like this but it velcros & the velcro sticks me sometimes so I was excited about the zippers. Really I think my only complaint is that it is a little too big, I wish it fit tighter. The top part sticks out away from my body & it kind of rubs again my skin & makes my shirt stick out (I wear it under my shirt). It just needs one more zipper & I think it would be great. I guess I will try cutting it & sewing it back smaller like I have read some of the other people doing."
2,Needs More Zipper Options,I bought this belt instead of the one with the velcro because I wanted more security that the belt would stay in place when I did my exercises. The very last zipper didn't provide enough restriction/tightness for me. One more zipper option would be great!!!
1,Very bad,"I got this belt knowing that it was going to be useful for a couple of months, but it torn apart the first day I used it. Very cheap quality. I cant return it because I dont live in the USA, and its going to cost me 10 or 15 usd more, so its not worth it.Its the first time I got something with such a poor quality from AMAZON. Dont buy this belt."
2,Not for people with small waist,The slimming belt didnt fit my waist. I placed the zipper on the last zip slot to make it the tightest and it was way too big. im not the smallest person. i am about a size 6 on top. I had a child and wanted something to reduce the looks of my mommy pouch. I gave this to my mom and she says it works for her. She is about a size 14. It makes her sweat a lot! But after wearing it a while it begins to loose its elasticity. She stays between the middle zip and the last zip (the smallest sized zip). so i guess in all if your larger than a size 10-12...this would be a good product to buy.
1,Bally slimmer belt,"I tried it one time and the zipper will not hold in a smaller adjustment, it's not usefull at all, would like a refund if possible"
1,too big!,"i try it but it was too big, try to add another zipper to make it fit to my waist but even then was big, it didnt last long to fall apart, waste of money, dont bother buying it, find spomething else!!"
2,"Warning! objects on box appear ""smaller""....","Attractive, appears sturdy and comfy, but...I was excited when I noticed the 3-zipper ""paneling"". I imagined myself working my way down the panels as I ""melted"" off the post baby pounds. Imagine my dismay when I put this ""holster"" (belt) on and it didn't fit. Too big?!?! whatduh?? According to the picture on the box, I should have needed assistance from my two kids and hubby to get into this thing; (did you see the ""tiny"" chick on the box?!?). I am a good size lady (12)...So I would say sizes 14 down pass on this.BTW: I started in the first panel."
1,Falls Apart,"I am not skinny, but I am also not 250 pounds. The belt pulled apart at the seams the first day. It's going back.I am disappointed that the seems and interior material are so cheap. I like the fact that this belt had zippers."
2,Disappointed,"I was excited by the reviews from the other users and I wanted this belt so bad, I couldn't wait. I was extremely disappointed: The material the belt is made of is extremely light, so it doesn't hold me tight. I am using the last zipper (which you are supposed to use when you get slimmer) and the belt is still loose (I am a size 14); I cannot see the trimming effect at all, it makes me look bulky instead. The material is tearing up (after 2 days of wearing the belt), yet it is fitting me loosely: it's not like I was pulling the belt to close it. This belt might have worked for other users but for me, it is a big disappointment."
4,Bally Slimmer Belt,I am enjoying the first signs of slimming and toning with the slimmer belt. After four weeks my stomach muscles are tightning and I am dropping inches off my waist. I cant wait to be able to zip myself in the slimmer belt using the last zipper.
4,Bally slimming belt,"This is my third one in about 10 years, the first one I just threw out because it finally fell apart, the second one was poorly constructed and didn't last very long, now on to this one, it's not as good as the first, but definately better than the second, it's put together very well, however it will stretch out sooner then I think it should, to compensate for this it should have a fourth zipper option so it can be used longer as you lose weight and inches around the middle, but that will only be a problem when you get down that small, the stitching is holding up alright for now, time will tell"
4,I liked it,I like this belt because it makes my stomach sweat and I think that it is slowly helping it go down. I feel like I am losing inches slowly.
1,Poor Quality,"I am average sized, so I used the belt on the tightest zipper. I wanted to keep warm when I jogged outside in the winter, so I felt this would keep my core warm while avoiding wearing a jacket. I used the belt twice on the treadmill and I noticed a red mark on my side after the second use. I looked at the belt and the neoprene had separated from the seam. I literally used the belt twice for a total of two hours. Poor quality. I sent it back for a refund. I guess it is back to wearing a jacket!"
2,Good quality bad fit,"Great quality especially like the long line feature. However it will not adjust small enough to do me any good. Need to add more zippers! Any waist smaller than 30"" will not work with this one."
4,It's doing something...,I have been using this slimmer belt for only 3 weeks and it does cause you to sweat in the midsection even without exercise. I wear it daily and it provides lots of back support and hides the ugly back fat extremely well...I only wish it were longer. My greatest benefit is that it makes me feel full fast because it is constantly applying pressure to my intestines so it has forced me to eat less. It was inexpensive and I intend to buy about 2-3 more because the inner material is ripping and I would like to continue using it.
3,They don't work for slimming but..,They work to keep the rolls & gut in while working out lol. I'm doing turbo fire and my stomach was bouncing around wayyyy to much! So got this and now I can move more freely with it holding my stomach in place :) It does create tons of sweat also!
2,Don't Bother,"I am very disappointed with this product. It does make you sweat, but does not offer any support. After a couple of washes the belt started to come apart at the seams."
4,Too small for big men- but great for women!!!,"This was for my husband but he couldn't get it around his stomach ( he wars a 44"" pants). I took it from him and it's great. It's pretty comfortable and I like that there are zippers to adjust it to different sizes BUT I also don't like that the zippers look weird under tight clothes. Wear this with a loose shirt covering it if you're wearing it out. I don't know if it's making a difference yet but I do sweat a lot while I'm wearing it (I usually wear it around the house). It was quick to get here and new in packaging which I also liked."
2,horrible size,"the zip system is not too godd, it doesn't fit me, although it says one size fit all, it is big on my even on the third zip, so for me it was a waste of money. otherwise it is good."
2,Cheap zippers,"I bought this product to help slim my waist back down during post-pregnancy workouts. It worked great until I tried tightening it once to get a better effect (the zipper closure I had it on just wasn't tight enough to be effective) and the zipper tore away from the elastic material! I was very diasppointed. I love the idea of this product and it definitely worked for awhile...but I would steer people towards a slimming belt with velcro closure. Just don't plan on going out in public with either of these on or wearing them under clothing for a ""slimming effect""...it's not what they're meant for!"
4,Great quality product but very slim in size.,"I bought this because it says that it will fit any size waist. I got the product and was impressed by the zipper design. It does attempt to fit multiple waist sizes but, at least for me, it was a very tight fit. I really had to work at it. If the zipper is not perfectly aligned then it is very tough to zip up. I would say that if you are in a nice slim waist size then you should have no problem at all. But, if you need to lose a few pounds then you might struggle getting this around you. Once it is on it works great. It's just tough to get on."
3,ok product,"i really like this product, but after wearing it a few times the belt starts to come apart at the seams"
1,Not what I needed,"I was looking for a support for my back and after reading the other reviews, thought this would be helpful, but it was not. It was too light to give any support and will return it."
5,Great stuff including for MEN!,"Okay, Am a Male weight 240ibs/ and 6'1'' tall. I carry on some extra weight AKA (the muffin) So I saw this item with great reviews. I thought I'd try it. i had it on for longest period of time, I even wear it at work/going out/ and GYM!! the only time I have it off is 3-4hrs b4 i go to sleep and during my ""sleep"" another words I LOVE IT. This is not only for Females it works for both. i have had it for over a week now and its amazing. I am thinking about ordering few more for backup and to just have extra on me."
4,Slim and Trim,Love this item. I work out in this belt with ease and don't feel stuffed. Very easy to put on and don't make clothes look bulky when you have it on. I recommend this item for purchase and a great deal.
1,dont buy!!!!!,had it 3 dAYS AND ZIPPER POP OFF ....WASTE OF MONEY!!!! IT WORK BUT WHO WANT SOME THAT DONT STAY TOGETHER..... :(
2,Weak Structure,"I'm 6'1"", 275 lbs, somewhat fit, with a 38"" waist...wore this item and the neoprene ripped from the stitching in less than a half hour. The stitching is weak around the base, at least mine was. Wouldn't buy this brand again."
3,Not as strong as expected...,"I bought this product after reading several reviews that seemed to indicate the good out-weighing the bad. Well, it worked fine for a few workouts; but the rubber inside ripped when I adjusted to a smaller size. This indicated to me that the rubber is not strong enough to withstand much stretching. I sewed it up in hopes of maintaining the shape and elasticity, but the rubber ripped right through the stitches. Yikes!Currently, I still use the belt for exercise (although the ripped rubber may be compromising my results). The whole experience made me think that the product was cheaply made; and if twelve dollars is cheap, then I certainly got what I paid for! I will definitely be looking for something better while eating my savings!If you decide to buy this, it could work well for you; just make sure that you are gentle with the zipper and careful when stretching it to the next level!"
4,Slimming and Trimming,"I love this belt. It's an awesome item to use with various other techniques to slim the waist. If you are willing to put in the effort, this belt will work wonders for you. I sweat with the first 10 minutes of my workouts with this belt. LOVE IT!"
3,Not very durable,"This belt does what it's supposed to do; however, I have to replace mine after only about 15 uses because the inner lining tore. This is not a very durable product!"
2,Not the Best,I brought this item and looks exactly like the picture and seemed to be great quality. The only problem I had was the zipper. It kept coming down while walking or exercising.
4,good value,"Good product, helps to create a sweat during a workout. However, neoprene smell is really strong even after hand washing. Still a good value."
2,Too loose...,"Too loose... Thought it will be thigher. Make me sweat, but keeps going up while exercising. Look bulky under clothes particularly the front zipper..."
5,Excellent and you can't beat the price,This item was the least expensive of all the ones I looked at. I ordered it - it arrived in a timely manner and was eveything I needed. Thank you.
3,Works great,The belt is not blue its tan and the belt does not have 4 zippers it has 3. Its a good belt but u will need to add more zippers if needed.
2,need sizing info,"They need to be more specific about the size, unless you have a 30"" waist and above."
3,its ok,"its fo bigger people. I have a 30"" waist and it was lose on the last zipper but i took the zippers out and re- sew them to get a better fit. its not that bad. It dont really make me sweat unlike some pther ppl's review''s i've read but lets see how it works"
1,Would not buy another one,Item did not work. It broke me out with blisters on my stomach There should be a warning on the package about breaking out with this Belt
5,Best Belt EVER,"I love these belts!! They are so much better than the velcro belts that stick and cut my skin once I've worked out. These are easy to put on, comfortable and wash well."
3,Not the fault of the garment I'm sure.,I was sad to see that I was already into the smallest size of this so could not take advantage of the different sizes of zippers offered. I returned it. I think this has great promise as a concept.
2,Does not last long,Sorry was very unsatisfied with how long or how little this belt lasted. Literally 4 months with moderate exercise. Not acceptable. It began ripping after first wash.
1,ZIPPER BROKE!,"The first time I put this on, the zipper broke! It definitely does not work when you can't even get it to zip to close it up. What a waste of money."
4,A series that's light-years better than it looks,"I picked up the first book in the _Dinoverse_ sextet (there's six of them) in a discount book store, as it was cheap, the cover art was horrendous, and the premise seemed ridiculous. I was expecting, for fifty cents, to enjoy making fun of it. Go figure, I now own the entire series as it's actually quite good. There are three story arcs which each cover two books. For my money, the first two books are the best. The second story arc is okay, but repetitive (and a little far-fetched at times). The final two books are as good a resolution as any, I guess, but just nuts in parts (think surfing dinosaurs, telepathic interdimensional aliens, and -argh- a food fight scene). Still, overall, this series is great fun and has a great respect for animals and nature."
4,excellent taste of david j solo material,"obviously if you've found this screen you already know a bit about david j/love and rockets/bauhaus ""night of the silver veil"" ""saint jackie"" and ""docter/seducer"" are great tunes but ""crocodile tears and the velvet cosh"" is absolutely amazing... so good theres two versions. ""this vicious cabaret"" is taken from alan moore's graphic novel ""V for Vendetta"" an insightful read. BUY THIS DISC"
4,a cops cop,Book was great. Like how the author new what he was writing about. The authors personal experience was very interesting and believable.
4,Perfect Pets,"These are too cute, strange but cute. They look a little prehistoric but it is amazing how these creatures hatch from dried eggs. I am a little disappointed in the fact out of hundreds of eggs only 11 hatched and 8 have died. This was given to my daughter at Christmas and we opened it on New Year's Day. It is now the middle of April, so we have 3 still living (knock on wood). They are perfect pets, not much maintenance."
2,Sea Monkey Kit,I purchased this kit to use in my first grade classroom. My students were so excited and began keeping journals when we could first see the sea monkeys. The hatchlings were very tiny but visible. One week later they had all vanished. We are very disappointed!
4,Lovecraft on LSD!,"The Unspeakable written by Dan Clore is definitely not for the squeamish. Good horror literature as this, is indeed rare. Deeply dark without being prurient. Each tale is a fantabulous mind-bending trip of Lovecraftian proportions. All the tales (stand seperate), form a cohesive binding whole that makes the Unspeakable, speak. Each story is a ""penny dreadful"" written by the exo-outerly enigmatic Lord Weyrdgliffe of the Waughters. Highly recommend this in small doses on those nights you want to be creeped out!"
1,Ouch,It is reputed that the author suffers from chronic pain. It is not clear whether that pain is the cause or a consequence of his writing style. My guess: the former.
5,One Of The Best.,"The Judds Were An Awsome Duo Before Brooks & Dunn. These Here Are Their Best Of The Late 80's And Early 90's. Songs Like: ""Let Me Tell You About Love"", ""Turn It Loose"", ""(Young Love) Strong Love"" And ""Love Can Build A Bridge"". Buy This CD."
1,Outdated,"As a first-time mom, I've read many many books trying to understand my newborn, why she was crying and most importantly how to stop the crying! This book brings up some interesting methods in which a baby is able to self-calm (for example, he writes of placing baby on it's side, facing a white or blank wall). I also remember reading some grossly outdated information such as breast-feeding does not provide immunity, etc... This book may have been ""the answer"" when it was first published (in the mid-80s I believe), but today there are many more current writings which are far more helpful. Some of those titles are ""The Happiest Baby on the Block"" By Harvey Karp, MD, ""The Secrets of the Baby Whisperer"" By Tracy Hogg, ""Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child"" By Marc Weissbluth. Those were the most helpful to me in the early months of my baby's life. As for this book, it's outdated."
1,absolute garbage,The theory of self-calming in this respect goes against every loving mother's nature!
2,"vague, lacks tight logical connections","The link between symmetry and conservation laws would be a great topic for popularization, and I would love to see a book that would do for symmetry what, e.g., Feynman's QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter does for field theory. Unfortunately, this book just doesn't accomplish what it set out to do. The big problem is that it lacks tight logical connections. There is no clear unifying thread of reasoning that would allow the lay reader to make sense of it all. I'm a physicist, so I can see what he's getting at, but I don't think I would have been able to make much sense out of the book if I hadn't already been familiar with the subject."
4,Reasonable contents,"The book covers most of current modern physics knowledge. However, the explanations for some of the most complex issues (specially the last two chapters)are a bit weak. I also found the whole description of Noerther's theorem disappointing, in spite of apparently being one of the ""main"" points the authors want to get through. In the end the reader is left wondering WHY some of the conservation laws actually come from space/time symmetries. The last two chapters are really hard to follow. I understand the intend of the authors to reach a wide audience, but sometimes, a bit of simple math instead of lengthy explanation with dubious value might have been better."
4,A very nice synthesis of ideas,"This is actually either a five star or a three star book -- it depends. If you've read a few layman's books on particle physics you've undoubtedly run into various discussions of symmetry. This book nicely ties together all of those dicsussion -- and hence a five star book. If this is your first layman's book, it might be a bit bewildering to learn the basics starting with symmetry, eventhough symmetry is the basis for many principles. In my opinion you'd be better off with a more basic book as a first book on the topic -- and hence a three sttar book."
4,Well padded everywhere except underside,"A good martial arts boot that is very well padded especially at the top where there is very thick padding, but also everywhere except the underside. That is unfortunate as there isn't real protection for front kicks but at least there is a covering in the front half, which is better than practically all of the martial arts boots I've seen where the underside tends to have no padding or coverage. A very well made and quality boot that, like most, could be improved with the addition of underside or ball and heel padding."
4,GREAT SELECTION!,"If you're looking for quality recordings by RITCHIE VALENS, this is it. In this package, you'll find all of his DEL-FI/Bob Keane tapes, remastered and great! There is a STEREO version of ""La Bamba"" and Bob Keane's Home Recordings of Ritchie doing ""Donna"" and ""Cry, Cry, Cry"". There are many of the Gold Star Studio outtakes that make this package very special. This is a must for RITCHIE fans."
5,Begs to be read aloud!,"I first read this beautiful book when I was 12. I am now 36 & can attest this book is even richer & more resonant as an adult. The underlying themes of love, intimacy, & abuse of power are issues in everyone's life, whether you are a witch who must learn to love a human or an everyday millenial! The language is so lovely, so entrancing, you will find yourself reading aloud even if alone. If you're shopping for a favorite pubescent, BUY THIS. If you're shopping for yourself BUY THIS! And if you've ever read any fantasy at all BUY THIS!"
5,A book that captures non readers and gets them hooked,"This book is the one I remember most fondly from my childhood and the one that I read over and over and over again. It is the book, though I know I read others, that meant the most to me at my fragile 11 years of age and hooked me on reading for good. I am delighted to say it did the same for my 11 year-old daughter who WAS a reluctant reader."
5,Just a Beautiful Fantasy,"The plot is almost secondary in this novel, though there's nothing wrong with the plot. McKillip's descriptions of the animals are the most captivating aspect. Another of her works that I recommend to everyone I know. Her characters are fully developed with understandable motivation and logical actions. I still dream about those animals."
3,Okay,"It promised to be an interesting book and it was...somewhat. But that girl really got on my nerves! she's a bit selfish and really kinda creepy. I did like Coren and wanted to cheer when he put her in her place. And I really got sick of they way they talk ""I can not"" ""I will not"" ""I do not"" instead of ""I don't"" etc. It just bothered me! I was disappointed by it, but if you want to read it, try it from a library and then buy it if u like it."
2,COLD!!!,"Okay, all I have to say is that the main charecter was cold and unfeeling and I didn't like her at all!!! Any writer should know that readers won't care what happens if they don't like the charecters. Coren was way too good for her and the ending was really, really, really messed up.That's all I have to say"
5,the best,"I love this book. I usually dislike McKillip because her writing is descriptive to the point of being distracting and unclear. This book, however, was much more clearly written than her usual, with a much better plot. Sybel was not exactly sympathetic, but I was strongly attracted to her. Despite the well-worn plotline of the ""ice queen"", this book never became cliche or corny. It is best offering of McKillip that I have read so far."
4,simply beautiful,"this is the first book of patricia mckillip i've read after the riddlemaster trilogy. there are a lot of fantasy book writier who focuse on one world and one type of charecter and i was expecting it to be some sort of extention of that book.i was very pleased to realize that she invented a whole new world just for this book and such a beautiful world it is. there's somthing very airy about this book, very lucide and flowing, though the plot's not packed with imagery, charecter and places such as in the riddle master, there's somthing about the silence and minimalizm (well relative minimalizm, it's still a fantasy book...) that's vert apealing to me.the story is very beautiful, the charecter and interesting and round, and the simple massage of love and freedom just hit the spot for me and gave me the advice i needed when i read it."
5,must read this book,"I first read this book while hiding in the library of my high school, while bunking class. I was in 9th grade then and used books as an escape. Still using books as an escape, and this book is still fabulous, although I am now middle aged. If you like fantasy, this book is very evocative. The author paints beautiful pictures of the magnificent isolation of the wizard woman's mountain, and the equally magnificent isolation of her soul. When the world intrudes on her in the form of a handsome prince and an infant, we see her thaw in the unacustomed warmth of their company. Well worth a read!"
3,Not quite what I was expecting,"I've read a number of Patricia McKillip's books. Her writing is usually beautiful and very poetic.In The Forests Of SerreThis - not so much. The plot and characters are interesting but the writing seems for a much younger level than what I'm used to from her. Still, I would defintely recommend this book for any 'young adult' collection."
5,Never forgotten,"I read this book perhaps 30 years ago, fell in love with it and Patricia McKillip then, and I've just reordered it to see how it re-reads. Although it's fantasy fiction I actually learned a lot about self-awareness from The Forgotten Beasts of Eld. A beautiful book, wonderfully well written."
5,One of the best fantasy works I've ever read,"I read this quite a few years ago, and it began my love of the fantasy novel. It combines action, love, magic, and mystery into a wonderful story. A must read!"
4,Solid live album,"Death By Stereo is awesome live. This 17 track cd is a great example of Efrem's charisma and the band's cohesiveness. The only downside is the fact that it only features songs from their first 3 cds. Their fourth cd, Death For Life, is their best to date. This cd was recorded in 2003, during their Into the Valley tour. Death Alive features some lesser known songs that are popular live, such as Hippie Holocaust and Dance Party. I have never actually heard Dance Party before, but they must have only played it at a few shows. This cd represents a band that plays for the sheer thrill. They don't do it for money or fame. They do it because they love their fans and they love playing music. Please support this band and buy this cd. There are only 2000 copies floating around, so make sure you pick one up soon. You won't be dissapointed. Death for life!"
3,Good Older Expanable Phone,"I like these units very much. The LCD is clear and easy to read, and sound is also very clear. The buttons are clearly marked, and easy to understand. I gave it 3 Stars because the instructions we terrible, and set-up was a bit difficult.You can also use any of the new handsets by RCA with these units, so older ones and newer ones work equally well.Its a very slick and chic system for the home office and I really like the larger handsets both corded and cordless, as they fit in my hand better.Very recommended at this price level, the new models are far too expensive for the med-range quality, but the older units are exceptional."
4,Great fragrance!,"I had read that this perfume was selected in a top-ten list of most popular fragrances and I believe it becauseit smells very nice when my Wife wears it. It smells like she's wearing a bouquet of flowers.It was delivered on time and was packaged well.I would recommend this product and seller to any man who is interested in finding a great smelling and popularfragrance for that special lady in his life. Great product, with a great price from a great seller."
2,Seems different,"I used to LOVE this Bill Blass fragrance that I used about 28 years ago. It has been difficult to find over the years. I have to admit that I was disappointed in the bottle I recieved last month. I do not know if it really is somewhat different or if my memory of it is not accurate, but it does smell different to me."
4,Bill Blass By Bill Blass For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray,"Exquisite fragrance, everything I expected. My mom used to wear the Parfum, so when I came across this item, for such a low price I thought: I have to buy.Incredibly fast shipping also.abvn.-"
2,Nice pictures,"I was looking for a guide for tips on the San Diego area, there is definitively not a lot of usefull reading on this book but if you look for nice pictures it is perfect. That's just not I was looking for..."
4,Refillable Ecopad for classic Senseo,My Senseo was a Christmas present so I plan to use it once in a while. The coffee pods disappeared from Denver stores six months ago. This gives me hope that I can use Senseo when the price of ground coffee comes down from the stratosphere. ncl
3,Just OK,Ecopads work OK but coffee tends to be weak - should probably use espresso beans to boost flavor. Still prefer Senseo pods
3,My ecopods will last forever!,"Got my ecopods at the same time I bought the Hamilton Beach brewer. I filled them with finely ground Columbian Supremo coffee and had a cup of weak coffee. I tried cramming them until they could hardly close, and still got a weak cup of coffee. (You can only get so much in them and then they don't close). I had read all of the reviews on Amazon and was impressed with the idea of reuseable pods, but unless you can fit three pods into the HamBeach brewer, you only get a so-so cup. I must have strong coffee or I am unfit for the day. My Ecopods will last forever because I will not use them again. NOt Amazon's fault, they are my go-to site for just about everything, but my expectations of the ecopods were, I guess, unrealistic. If you want a really strong cuppa, try something else."
2,Ecopad Refillable Coffee Filters,It does not work in my Senseo and causes the water to run all over. Ecopad the refillable coffee filter
2,Good idea,"I bought these with the intention of saving paper and money. Unfortunately they are too small to hold sufficient coffee to make a cup that is the right strength for my taste. They are currently sitting in a drawer somewhere, not being used."
2,Fails the quality test...,"I used this products as instructed and the product produced a poor quality, very watery, very light undrinkable cup of coffee. Will not use it again. I don't recommend that anyone order this item."
1,Dissapointed,We could not get these to work. The coffee comes out too weak. My daughter bought a Keurig this Christmas and loves it!
1,Not a real espresso,I wanted to have a real espresso machine for an inexpensive price but the association of the Senseo of these refillable coffee filter makes a real bad coffee
2,Not So Great,I didn't realize that I had not reviewed this item. It was difficult to use and even harder to clean.
2,Ecopad,The device did not fit comfortably into my machine and the coffee has to be very finely ground.
5,Better than buying the pods!,These things are cool! I like the fact I can choose what coffee to use in my system.
1,waste of time and money,"unfortunately, a total waste of time and money. I really wish it had worked as advertised, I would have liked to experience the savings related to not having to purchase the costly coffee pods. I tried to fill the Ecopad with different grinds of various beans (e.g. fine, medium, extra fine, extra extra fine, etc.). I tried packing them tightly, loosely and in between. It made little difference. The water seemed to find its way around the plastic pod with varying results, as opposed to through it. There was a point where it was almost acceptable but difficult to replicate the success. Oh well."

2,A bit messy -,"It does the job, but it is work packing it with coffe because there is no easy way to do it without making a little mess and having to clean the outside of the holder before you use it. Clean up after using it is a little hassle too because you have to get every little bit of coffee out and off of it. It misses the point of having a pod machine because it's now more work than just haveing a regular coffee maker. The whole process seems to not be worth the trouble unless you have a coffe you absolutely must have. There are dozens of excellent coffees out there (forget Senseo brand) in pod form if you search on the net. Half the fun of having a pod machine is trying different coffees."
2,Gets stuck,This product is a great idea.BUTIt catches on the top of the Senseo.I had to force the top up twice and it made a loud cracking sound.I will not use this product again for fear of damaging my new senseo.
1,Did not fit the Gevalia...,Did not fit the Gevalia...although other research had said it would. Probably would be happy with them if they worked for my unit.
1,does not work for JV pod coffee makers,"I bought this product because I use Senseo pods in my JV coffee maker. Well, these don't work at all. Sounds like a good idea, but they won't work in other pod coffee makers."
2,Messy but works,"Just as described. Works as expected. Then you have to wash it out. I know, I'm spoiled. Back to buying pods."
2,Ecopad refillable coffee filter,"First off, does it work? Yes! Works very well! Well then, why two star rating? Hey! You bought your one cup dream machine to make one cup quickly and expertly all the time without all the fuss of cleaning up. Well, with this refillable filter...you are cleaning up and cleaning up big time. What to do? Buy some two or four cup coffe filters and fill them yourself. You will experiment at first..but when you arrive at the right size after trimming...you can make up a supply and just fill them up."
2,Sort of messy to use,"I thought the shipping was very high for the product. The pads are ok but are messy to use unless you have 2 sets-it might work better. Not impressed. I have gotten rid of my Senseo pot since ordering these. The coffee was ok but you either use the bought pre-made pods which are too expensive for me or the pot quickly looses its appeal. Went back to regular pot with fresh ground coffee and it's a lot more convenient. The eco-pods are ok, just the entire one pot thing didn't work for me."
4,Good offee atlast,"This product is as stated . the company shipped within 5 days with instructions to use and with a cutomer service phone number if any problems came up. If you are in the market for this product go ahead and order it , you won't be disapointed."
1,Not what I was looking for,"I have a pod coffee maker but not a senseo. This is only good for senseo coffee makers, so don't make the same mistake that I did and think that it will work for just any pod machine."
1,doesn't work on black and decker machine,"I tried using this product on the black and decker machine which uses senseo style pods. the water just went around the holder and I got extremely weak, un-drinkable coffee. Useless in this machine. :("
3,Makes a weak cup of coffee,"I wanted to save some money on pods so I gave this a try. It did not work as well as I had hoped. It makes a weak cup of coffee and I prefer a strong cup. I tried different coffees and different grinds but could not get the strength that a pod of dark roast gives me.On the positive side, it was easy to use and clean-up was a breeze. If you prefer your coffee on the weak side, this would work for you."
1,Thumbs down,"If you're not a yuppie coffee aficionado, and just buy the regular old Folgers, Maxwell House or Chock Full O' Nuts, you're going to be disappointed. I have a Hamilton Beach brew and go pod brewer, I bought these filters because I read here that they work well with your own coffee. Well, as soon as I got these, I filled one up with Dunkin Donuts coffee grounds and hit the brew button...the result was exteremely watered down coffee, disapointing and a waste of $15. Apparently, I need to buy a grinder now and grind down the coffee super-fine in order to get a decent cup? More money spent than what it's worth. Looks like I'm stuck just buying the pods."
1,Nothing but colored water!!,"While I do realize that I prefer my coffee on the stronger side, using these refillable pods produces nothing more than minimally colored water! I have my machine in my office and many co-workers have come to me with the same complaint, so I know that it's not just me.If you like your coffee weak, this will work for you; I have just ordered an alternative item off of Amazon, which looks to be made of material more similar to regular coffee filters (and has very good reviews)."
2,Weak Coffee,"The price is great and that's why I gave it 2 stars. However, I followed all the directions and still get weak coffee and a pool of water in the area of the Senseo where the pod is placed. If the procuct worked as advertised it would be a steal, but until someone show me that it works...2 stars."
3,Not for Hamilton Beach machines,"I tried these with my Hamilton Beach One Cup pod brewer and they do not work. The ""coffee"" that came out was weaker than tea. I ended up tossing the pod filter into the hot water into the cup (which actually did work).As other reviewers mentioned, it seems the hot water has to be forced through the filter in order to extract the flavor. The Senseo machines do this; the Hamilton Beach machines do not. The name does state ""for the Classic Senseo"".Believe it."
2,Not what I had hoped for,"I have the Hamilton Beach Personal Pod machine, that is what this review is based on.I received the product quickly and they were what I expected, however.....as many others have stated I just don't get the quality of coffee I want. Even packed with as much coffee as you can squeeze in it, you can almost see the bottom of your cup through the brew. I even thought if you can use 2 pods at a time, why not 2 Ecopads? Not recommended, have paper towels handy if you try it.So I just started using the regular 12 cup filters and my usual brand coffee. The trick is to fold the top of the filter closed without compressing the coffee. Leave it loose enough so the coffee will completely fill the bottom of the basket without letting water go around or under it. Hence the larger 12 cup filter instead of the smaller ones. Took a few tries to get the fold right, but now I get good fresh coffee every cup."
2,Watered-Down Coffee,Tried various types of grounded coffee and this product would not allow the water to appropriately drip/filter through coffee. End product was watered-down coffee. Disappointing considering these plastic filters were not cheap.
2,Refillable Coffee Filter,It doesn't work well in the Hamilton Beech single-serve coffee maker we have. It doesn't fit snugly in the pod holder and the hot water goes around it instead of thru it.
2,Almost works with Dunkin Donuts Coffee,"I just received the Ecopad filters and tried using them with Original Dunkin Donuts Coffee and the Hamilton Beach Personal Cup One Cup Pod Brewer I ordered from Amazon. At first, the coffee came out much too weak and clear so I tried using the Dark Coffee - still too weak. After experimenting (about fifth cup), I made sure the Ecopad filter was nearly filled, but that the grounds were loose enough to the point where I could shake them (IE: coffee is loose - not packed in whatsoever). This worked a little better where the result was black coffee and not clear, but after a week of using these, I'm giving up. You will only be happy if you like your coffee weak. :("
4,ECO PADS,"I love the Eco Pads with the new Senseo Pod coffee maker.They allow me to use my favorite coffee and the cost isless expensive than ready-made pods. I get my coffeebeans ground to Turkish, which is similar to expresso."
5,Must-have accessory for Senseo!,"I love good coffee, and viewed the ""pod"" requirement as a serious drawback to the whole Senseo system. Enter the Ecopad: this clean, convenient, inexpensive filter, sized just right for my Senseo, affords me freedom to indulge in all of my local whole bean coffee favorites while still enjoying the simplicity and speed of a single-serve coffee machine. I simply grind a few teaspoons of fresh beans, fill up the Ecopad, snap it together and brew. Even preserves the bit of foamy goodness typical with the Senseo pour. And clean-up is a quick rinse. I'm hooked."
3,coffee filter for senseo,When I ordered these filters I thought they would work in my Krups home cafe but they did not. Therefore I have no opinion of how well they work.
2,Senseo not as shown,My complaint is with the Senseo coffee maker. The advertising makes it look like you get a full cup of coffee with one pod. When you read the instructions you find that you only get a 4 ounce cup of coffee-good for Europeans but not for those of us in the USA where a cup of coffee is more like 8 ounces. It takes two pods to make a real cup of coffee on the machine and at over $6.00 for 18 pods in most Supermarkets this is very expensive-about $18 to $22 a pound although WalMart sells Senseo pods for $3.84 for 18 pods.Is it worth trying EcoPods?
3,EcoPads,"Product is OK, but not marvelous. It is a bit of a pain to load it up, and you need to be really really careful that no coffee is on the edge. It seems to work best when loaded loosely. Too tight, and the seal on the coffee maker blows, and water spews. It takes a bit of practice to get it right."
2,New and impoved - don't think so,"The new and improved Ecopad is far from new and improved. The old blue discontinued ones, worked great. These new ones, all they do is pour out water for the first 10-15 seconds and then maybe you will get something that resembles coffee pouring into your cup. I have tried finer grind, coarser grind, less coffee, more coffee but with no luck. They basically look the same and are the same size as the original blue ones, so I am not sure what the problem might be. I only have one of the original blue ones left and now use it most of the time while the other 6 new and improved rarely get used. Every now and then I will try one again and still no difference in how it works. I will admit you still get the foam but if you like a cup of brown water with foam go ahead and buy some.Very unimpressed with these new ecopads."
3,not bad BUT,"these work ok but I find that when I use then to make a large cup of coffee, (and I use strong coffee) I sometimes get a week cup, and I have to run the machine once on ""1 cup"" cycle, and then on the ""2 cup"" cycle to get a full cup (16oz) of coffee. They clean well and I am generally happy with them."
4,Works better than home made from coffee filter,I used to make my own pod using coffee filter paper. This Ecopad works better than my version but does not work as good as the original senseo pods.
5,Great Buy,"New Improved Brown Ecopad, the Refillable Coffee Filter for the SenseoWorks great, allows you to use any coffee.. follow instructions and don't overfill..lots less expensive than buying Senseo pads.. just rinse it out between uses and every few days or so, I run it through the dishwasher."
5,Refillable pod filter !! Excellent !!,"This is an awesome product !! It is just what I needed so I can use coffee from other types of containers in my little one cup pod coffee maker. I have used K-cups, ground coffee and other types by just putting the coffee in the filter and placing it in my machine."
2,Opinion,"Ecopad, the Refillable Coffee Filter for the Classic SenseoThis filter works but if you are someone who likes stronger coffee you can not put enough in the pod. After brewing the pod is hard to open and can be hard to clean if left without rinsing immediately.It fits well within the coffee maker and is good for loose tea leaves and if you like weaker coffee."
3,"Makes a great cup of coffee, but it's messy",I'm a big fan of the ecopod; putting fresh grounds in it makes a wonderful cup of coffee (much better than the for-purchase pods). The only downsides are that it's hard to gauge how much grounds fit into it and it's pretty messy to fill. Other than those two things I'd recommend giving it at try!
5,Great Product,I do not understand how people can have problems with these pods. They work great for me and if I can use them correctly in my Senseo then anyone can.
1,DONT USE WITH HAMILTON BEACH WONT WORK!!!,"These do not work AT ALLin the hamilton beach coffee maker. I trusted other reviews. All I got was hot water and a little color of coffee.Tried wetting first, turning it upside down, different coffee, everything!!! and only half the water comes out before machine turns offI have to send back now. Do not believe the ""IF YOU BUY THIS< WITH THIS< AND THIS"" you get all for one price.. These pods only could possibly work under pressure, which the hamilton beach maker is not!"
4,Ecopod works great -- with practice,"I have run almost a whole bag of coffee through my ecopod now and it has become my standard method now. I grind the coffee in an electric coffee grinder at the most fine setting, then run the coffee through again. I fill the pod about 3/4 full after tamping down the coffee very lightly. I get good foam, and a fairly strong brew. Using less coffee gets more foam sometimes, but the downside is a weaker cup. I have also put standard drip grind into our grinder to get it smaller in size, and that has worked good also. Grinding the coffee very fine fluffs it up and so it looks like you are loading a lot of coffee for each cup, but actually its about a heaping teaspoon of drip grind coffee, so it is very economical. Those having problems need to try again. If it works for me, it will work for anyone."
2,Not worth it,"I had originally written a favorable review, but this became too difficult to fool with and they didn't hold up- mesh stretched out and lid wouldn't pop on tight. Ditched it for the Keurig- very happy.If you want to try it, here is what I can tell you:Fill several at a time and keep them in a jar for am use- they have to be filled *just so* and no grounds in the seal or forget it. I can't accomplish that before I have a cup of coffee and some contact lenses, so there you go. Dont over fill. If you like strong coffee, go to the coffee place in your neighborhood and ask for them to grind your coffee of choice ""Turkish Grind"". Its the only way I could get an 8oz cup, but did occasionally let grounds slip through.Or bite the bullet and buy a Keurig so you can choose from dozens of coffees before having to try the My K cup."
4,Work very well,"The only draw back of this product is that you have to get rid of the coffee grinds, which I find messy.Since you can now put in your own taste/strength of coffee, I put up with the mess."
2,Only if you like weak coffee.,"I have a Hamilton Beach Senseo coffee maker, and even grinding the coffee very fine and putting another paper filter under it so the water wouldn't go around it, (the diameter is too small) it only makes very weak coffee.UGH!!"
2,"Great concept, WEAK coffee!!",Brews a very WEAK cup of coffee! I've YET to make an acceptable cup of coffee with this product. Will likely end up buying Senseos instead. EXTREMELY disappointed.
3,just so so,"I didn't buy these for the Senseo machine. They worked OK they just didn't hold enough coffee to make a strong cup, in my opinion. They were easy to use and easy to clean. I found that by using junior size coffee filters I could make my own ""pods"" and make coffee to my preferred strength."
3,ecopad refillable coffee filter,Unfortunately I like really strong coffee. And so I didn't like the coffee the coffee maker makes the ecopad performed as promised no mess no fuss . Easy to use. I liked it and would by it again.
3,Okay in a pinch,"These fit the Senseo brew basket perfectly, but I like a STRONG cup of coffee, and I can't get enough ground coffee in the little eco-pad to make my strength."
4,perfect addition,Awesome little addition to the senseo machine. Can use some of the good coffee now. Definitely recommend this.
5,Great to have!,"I brought this product because I got the coffee cup maker that takes pads for my coffee maker. I wanted to save money and use my own coffee, so I got this and LOVE it. Just make sure that the refillable coffee filter are the ones for your coffee maker. A must have product if you want to save money."
2,Eco Pad's not as good as pre-made pods,"It can't be the coffee (tried Folger's French Roast, Starbuck's House Blend AND Lavazza)so it must be the device. It produces an inferior cup of coffee - bland and weak. I tried filling it as the directions indicate as well as a little more and a little less, but always there is dry coffee left in the device as if the hot water could not get to it. I wanted to like it!!!"
3,Clean up difficult,"I never have more than one cup of coffee because the clean-up is not easy. It is difficult to clean out the filter to wash it. It gives me a good cup of coffee, only with more effort than I would like. I am retired so I have the time, but I would not continue to use this filter if I were still working. The concept of not throwing out the filters and clogging up the environment is one that I support, so I was hopeful that this would work and therefore more people would use them."
2,Will do in a pinch,They work but you have to make sure you do not pack the coffee in too tightly or the water runs around the filter not through it and you get a cup of light brown water. Also need to make sure it is cleaned well as the mesh gets clogged easily.
3,OK but Weak and no foam,I thought it was going to make as strong of coffee as with a pod and also leave foam but I have not had that result the taste is about like a regular drip type coffee machine and it has NO foam at all... kind of sad but oh well to late now..
3,not sure yet maybe ok,"I made two unsuccessful cups so far, packed them down like it says, with dark roast ground folgers. It was weak but hot, then ground same coffee in coffee grinder, looked good, but tasted weak. Today I am trying loose pack and using both pads. I'll add more later. site says to use expresso or turkish grind and to pack it down inside the pod. So I have coffee beans and will try that next.Easy to clean, just tap out the coffee and rinse off, don't use soap, it's not needed, air dry and use."
2,Tried it; didn't like it...,"I have used the Phillips Pod system for years now. The up side is that it's convenient, clean, and efficient. Plus, it leaves a wonderful crema in your cup. The down side is that the coffee pods you buy range from okay to stale and that they're expensive. So I tried these guys, filling them with coffee that I'd ground. They tasted fine and worked well -- but ... but the mess was as bad as any other system of making coffee -- perhaps worse. And, after a while, I managed to plug up the Phillips Pod Hole of Death and had to ""rest"" the machine for a week before it would open to be cleaned out. I threw out these pods. Bottom line: if you use these, you might as well use another system to make coffee. Fair enough."
3,Ecopad,It allows me to continue to use my Senseo coffee maker which is good but it's inconvenient and kind if a pain in the neck. I just keep hoping someone will start making the coffee pods again.
5,Good product,"Recived quickly. Alreadry had one of these, having two more is a lot hander. These are nice, I can use my own coffee, whick is cheaper and still as handy."
2,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed upon using the Ecopads. Great idea and well made, but even using two pods packed as much as possible with grounds (DD Coffee) - the coffee was so weak I couldn't even drink it. I'd return them but it's seems like more of a hassle for the price I paid."
4,Wonderful Product!,"I was a little hesitant about this purchase because some of the reviews weren't so positive. So, I decided to go for it and try the Ecopads myself. I love them! Yes, you have to fill each pad every time and pack the grounds well in order to brew a good cup of coffee and, yes, the clean up is a little messy. However, the trade offs are: you get to use any brand or flavored coffee and you save money because you're not always buying pods."
3,Ecopad,I did not notice that this item was for a Senseo. I thought it was for a Keurig. I returned it.
2,Doesn't fit my non-Senseo machine :(,"Fast service, decent built product - just can't use it because it's too big. :("
3,Will this work with the Black & Decker Home Cafe machine,Looking to see if this works like the Presto My Pod replacement filters for the Black and Decker Home Cafe unit.
5,Great product,I have used this and found that you can make your own pods with the coffee you like. The only thing is not to overload them or the water doesn't go through easily.
3,"WARNING, only makes 1/2 cup!","I just got these in the mail and I""m already disappointed. Although the pod fits in the 2-cup model, you have to press the 1-cup button, which only gives you 1/2 cup of coffee. The ad does not mention this that I can see. Who only drinks 1/2 cup of coffee?! I've used the paper filter route and it works great. I just thought this would be handy, but I doubt I'll use it much now."
1,does not work as advertised.,Does not work with Hamilton Beach stay or go personal pod brewer. Is shown as frequently bought with the Hamilton Beach but doesn't work properly.
1,not for Bunn!,this does not fit the Bunn pod coffee maker.don't buy this one it is not a universal pod refill.
1,Buyer beware,"Ecopods will not fit in either Senseo machine I own( 7810 and 7832 ), or a Gevalia machine that uses Senseo coffee pods---complete waste of money."
2,glad it was cheap ...,"I'm glad these pods were cheap. They work - but the coffee is weak no matter how much you try to cram into it. Clean up is easy .. I drop the grounds into my potted plants, and toss the pods in the dishwasher."
2,a nuisance,"Unless you buy a whole lot of these and do several at one time, it is really a nuisance. Also, if you happen to get coffee granules between the top and the bottom, it is problematic."
1,Not worth the price,"For what one pays for this item and its usefulness, it just isn't worth it. As many different coffees that are on the market today, and most of them have pods, by the way, a refillable coffee pad is unnecessary. This one is harder to use than a pod, and is harder to clean than it should be. Perhaps back in the beginning, when one could only buy a few flavors of coffees in pods, it may have been worth it, but now so many flavors are available, forget this item."
3,Wrong size for coffee maker,"I have an inexpensive Hamilton Beach coffee maker that uses Senseo pods for coffee - I wanted to save some money on the pods and make my own pods with this item.... But these ecopads do NOT fit my coffee maker - I should have read the other reviews that indicated that this is ONLY for the more expensive Senseo coffee makers.... too much hassle to return it, so I'm just saving them (in case a friend gets a Senseo or the prices go down)..."
4,Messy but handy,You can use these in the Black and Decker unit if you use the double pod insert.Your coffee must be ground very fine or it tastes like brown water.And you need to clean it out before it dries!!!!A lot cheaper than the premade pods for sure. If you have a grinder you can make regular coffee fine enough to do a great job
1,Could not get the ecopads to work,"I really made a mistake and bought 2 sets, thinking I could always have extras ready. I tried all types of grinds, I packed loosely, I packed firmly, I packed tight, I played and played. Still did not get a good cup of coffee. Finally, threw them out. Just taking up space. Learned a lesson on buying quantity."
4,Makes a good cup,"I have owned the new Brown Ecopad for a little over a month. The ecopad works great when a finely ground coffee is used. I have gotten the best results only when i gently pack the coffee into the filter. The characteristic crema (or foam, if you like) is always present and the consistency is usually similar to a good cafe americano. Clean up is easy and i am able to enjoy fresh coffee from my Senseo machine without the expense of disposable pods. I originally bought the machine to enjoy a good cup that is quick and easy. Ecopads have helped me do that with good fresh coffees from a local roaster. I recommend the product for those wishing to reduce waste and enjoy their own freshly ground coffee in the Senseo machine."
2,"Ecopads work, but are they worth the trouble?","I have the Senseo SL7810 coffee maker, and to make the Ecopad fit I had to cut a plastic nub off the bottom of the filter. After that, it works as advertised, and it makes a decent cup of coffee. However, I'm not so sure it is worth the 25-30 cents per serving that you save by not buying prepackaged coffee pods. First you have to grind the coffee beans. Even pre-ground coffee is often too coarse and will need to be ground again. Then there is the messy job of transferring the finely ground coffee into the filter, a task that can seldom be accomplished without spilling some. Afterwards there is the messy cleanup where you need to use a lot of running water to clean grounds out of the filter. All in all, it's a time-consuming process. To me, the main purpose of getting a single serve coffee maker was as a time saver."
3,It's better than the coffee duck- make sure you grind your coffee extra fine if you use it,"I bought this product after being unhappy with the performance of the coffee duck.This product doesn't leak water that doesn't go through the coffee from the pod-thing like the duck does, but in order to make a strong cup of coffee with this device you still need to grind it down to the consistency of flour. Such coffee does not exist commercially so you will have to grind your own. I buy ground coffee and then grind it down further to use this product. Grinding down beans to this required level would take forever.It is a good alternative to buying senseo pods and I hope they will last long enough to get my twelve bucks worth out of them."
5,Awesome product!,"I have had a wonderful experience with this product, it is much more practical and affordable than buying the premade pods or even using the Podmaker system. These pods are super easy to use and work well. My only complaint... I only bought 2 (and subsequently my dog ate one of those) but I intend to buy many more! They have held up very well so far its been nearly 2 months, I've filled them wet/dry and halfway inbetween."
3,Does NOT work in gevalia pod maker,"I bought this for a gevalia after reading it would work in their pod-maker. Sadly, it does not fit."
1,save your money,"terrible! Do not waste your money on this product... does nothing it says. Other then being recylcable and that's what you will want to do with it! Makes coffee so weak it is undrinkable, you need to run it through at least twice."
5,Perfect product.,"This is just what I needed. I can get different kinds of coffee and don't have to stress if I can't find the pods, which is getting increasingly harder to find in my area."
1,Tincture of Coffee,"I finally succumbed to a single-cup machine, one that uses the Senseo pods. I had no interest in using those, and so bought the two-pack of Ecopad's filter. I crammed in as much coffee as possible, then could not believe the result. See-through! So, not only are they vastly overpriced, if you like a strong cup of coffee they are not for you. And, frankly, they are not that easy to fill. (I solved my dilemma but simply cutting down a #4 cone filter and using about 3 tablespoons of good coffee.)"
3,Not what I thought it would be,I was hoping for better results. The filters will not hold enough coffee for my taste. Coffee was not strong enough for me. Wish they were thicker to hold more coffee.
1,Doesn't work for Model 7810,I bought this for my Senseo machine. They do not fit! The description for the item even says that it will fit machined that begin in 781? and my is a model 7810. Maybe I'm missing something but the compartment for the coffee is too thick and the top of the machine will not close. I am very disappointed. I even spent more of express shipping because I was so excited to get it in.
2,"Good Idea, but doesnt work.","Maybe I just did not read the info so I went back to my saved info and I did not see the following: ONLY WORKS IN SENSO MACHINES WITH MODEL # STARTING WITH HD781. I think I would have noticed, especially since the name of the machine is mis-spelled.But that's was OK because I want a Senseo machine. Now I find that Senseo direct sale is not selling anything but the Hamilton Beach and this does not work in the Hamilton Beach. I reviewed Senseo in other countries and it looks like some new machines might be so it might be appropriate to hold off making this purchase."
2,It's ok....?,I bought this with saving money in mind. It worked great for about 2 weeks then it got clogged somehow. I washed it and looked at it and I don't know why it will not let the water through. I guess I'm back to the old 12 cup.
1,Makes Tea out of Espresso?,"Good ideas, BUT ... Between the Hamilton Beach coffee maker for Senseo and Eco-Pads you can make Tea out of DARK Espresso Coffee. Pads are NOT too easy to use, but the coffee results are unacceptable. Very weak coffee from otherwise strong grounds in another maker. Returning BOTH for refunds."
1,noJoe,"The Ecopad was a waste of Money, it doesn't hold enough coffee. I found some two cup coffee filters at Target that work. great"
5,Perfect for when you want fresh coffee out of your Senseo,"I like good, freshly ground coffee. I'm not a huge fan of the Senseo pods - they are a bit stale. This little gizmo gives me the flexibility to quickly have a cup of fresh ground coffee, and that's what I was looking for when I bought the Senseo. The key to making it work is to be sure to fill it to the top with finely ground coffee - at least that's been successful for me. Good strength, quick cleanup. No grounds in my cup. And always the nice foamy Eurpoean head. No complaints. Be forewarned though, anything less than full, and you've got a cup of hot water."
2,Eh....,"These seem to be a bit larger than they should be, which is annoying.These were very disappointing."
2,don't care for these,"The main problem for me is that you have to use finely ground coffee. I guess I should admit that I am a klutz, but I have a hard time filling these without making a mess. You have to be careful not to leave any grounds around the rim. Once that is done, though, it is easy to use them in the coffee maker. SInce I use my little coffee brewer at work, I prefer to use the Folger's single serve bags. Still relatively inexpensive."
4,Ecopad coffee filter,"We are happy with this product as we cannot find the pods in our area, now we can buyregular coffee and make our own pods."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Water was unable to pass through the filter sufficiently. Coffee turned out very, very weak! With shipping and cost of filters these are definately not worth the price!"
3,ok,This is OK for those that don't mind cleaning the hoder each time you make a cup of coffee. I like the disposable pds.
1,Does not work as Advertised,"If you like weak coffee, maybe this is the product for you. Even after following the instructions exactly, the Ecopad makes a watered down cup of coffee. I bought from CoolCC and they convieniently included .pdf instructions after the unit shipped.It says you have to use the 4oz water setting from using the 8oz pod holder. You have to fine ground the coffee to try to get the 8oz to taste right and use a dark roast coffee. Instructions also state don't overfill the pod or it will break because from expansion. Don't leave the pod in coffee maker for any length of time, because coffee will expand when wet and will burst the pod.Total waste of money and time. CoolCC have not replied to my emails about returning. They have 10% restocking fee as well."
2,Watch orders carefully,"This item, searched 3 mos ago, was added to an order I was trying to place. How could this happen?"
1,Not worth the trouble,I used this with my Senseo; it produced a very weak cup of coffee with almost no foam at all.
2,disappointed,"I bought the Ecopod for use with the Senseo coffee machine, which can make an expresso, (small), or normal sized cup of coffee. When you fill the pod with the amount of coffee that should make a normal cup of coffee, you get something so weak it's undrinkable. That amount of coffee will make a good demi-tasse. Seems that the ecopod is a bit small for the senseo, so water goes around it instead of thru it."
4,An absolute essential for the Senseo,"I love this product so much that I ended up buying another set. I haven't had any problems using it. I do find that regular coffee doesn't work well with these---I use the Melitta fine-ground Columbian, and it makes a perfect cup of coffee, without the expense of the throwaway pods!"
4,Ecopad mesh tears easily,"I like the ecopad but they tell you to pack it tightly. So, then you pack it tightly and the mesh tears.The coffee tastes great using a fine grind...but the mesh should not tear after a month a use."
3,Ecopad.,"It's okay, if you put to much coffee in the pod it causes the machine to break seal and then waters and coffee is all over the place. It takes to much time to load and like I said before to much coffee and you have a problem. One pod will make a weak 8 oz cup so for me I need to use two pods to get the coffee like I want it. One cup setting twice."
3,Okay,This is a clever product but you must get just the right variety of coffee grains or it won't work well. It is hard to get the same consistency per cup each time. It's either too dark or too light. It's a bit fussy.
3,You can only use one ecopad in the two pod filter -,"For a stronger cup of coffee, I prefer two pods, which cannot be done with the Ecopads. Only one Ecopad will fit and only in the two pod filter."
2,Not what I had in mind,"I was looking for something to work with my Hamilton Beach single cup mini brewer - I swear I looked all over the product information, and didn't see anything that said it wouldn't work with it. By the size and shape, it looked like it would fit the unit. It didn't. I even tried to modify the top so that the tabs would fit into my machine, and even with that working, it made terrible coffee. It's a shame, because I like the concept, and I hope that it works well with the Senseo brewer, for which it was developed. Don't get it for your Hamilton Beach brewer."
4,Love the ability to make own pods,"Great product. Love the ability to make own pods. Also not wasting the paper filter pack every time. It is a bit of a pain to load the pods, so I suggest buying several and just taking the time once a week or so to load several pods at one time for later use."
1,"Not a $ saver, but $ waster","The product is described clearly; It is what it says~description good, However, the ecopad doesn't hold enough coffee to make a decent cup of coffee. Regardless of the ground (dark roast, etc) there's just not enough coffee grind able to be enclosed & cup of coffee comes out like water, literally. I'm a ""light"" roast coffee drinker, but this isn't good at all. We will have to go back to the regular coffee pods."
2,Did not work for me and my Senseo machine,"I was really excited to be able to re-use these filter pods and use whatever coffee I wanted in my Senseo machine, but I never achieved a satisfactory cup of coffee. I ground fine. I ground medium. I over packed. I under packed. All the cups turned out weak and undrinkable. Great idea, but does not work at all. Maybe I will try making my own filter, like one of the reviews on this page described. But for so much mess, I'd almost rather just keep buying the Senseo and Melitta pods as long as they're available."
1,coffee filter,Did not work . Broke our coffee maker. Made water leak from coffee maker. Was not very pleased with this at all.
1,Top Locked,"I just recieved my ecopods and tried it and now I can't open the top of my Senseo, now what??? Sounded like such a good item."
3,Ecopad money saver.....time saver???,Works great as along as you clean it properly before next use. Initially coffee was a little diluted but later we figured out the quantity and ground the coffee finely which made a difference. We are enjoying it and recommend to others.
2,Ehh...,"I brew 16-20oz cups of coffee, so both Ecopads are required to brew to the appropriate strength. I tried beans ground as fine as the grocery store's grinder would do. Makes my Hamilton Beach overflow like crazy...a mess all over the place! I try brewing with one Ecopad of Folgers and a regular Senseo pad. Still overflows a bit.Make sure not to grind your beans too much; it acts as a sponge and doesn't let water drip through, plugging up the ""filter"" area of the coffeemaker and causing an overflow."
1,just look at the price!,"Buy it, you will know what I mean.Buy it, unless you don't mind your precious time.Buy it, you will understand why it's so CHEAP. It was cheaper."
4,complete for the beginner,"I am a third year student at UCLA and a programming major. I am currently in my second C++ course and needed some help with Windows programming. I bought Osborn's book Visual C++.NET.I have to tell you that this book is very complete. I wasn't so interested in the introductory C++ stuff because I had that in my first C++ course. (Well, okay - I had to review a lot of that material). However, the Windows code and how to write programs was great.We're using a text book in my course that has a lot of theory but not many examples. The Osborn book has GREAT example code. I was drawing shapes and pasting pictures in programs in just a couple of days. Others in my class couldn't figure out how to put images in code - I had to show them.My boy friend is in graduate school and he has borrowed this book twice - that is saying a lot because he is such a brain.Osborn - your book reall helped me."
1,Totally disappointed!,"If you know C++ already and only need a book to tell you something about visual c++ .NET, DO NOT buy this book. It really starts to teach you about Visual C++ .NET from page 664. More than 50% of the book is on C++. P.S. it's also not a good book for learning pure C++."
2,C++ and a tiny bit of .Net,"This is a very rich book on C++ and will provide a wealth of knowledge for those unfamiliar with the language. As for experienced C++ developers... stay FAR away. This book should have been titled : "".Net not included"". By saying C++ .Net reference... they mean that they ran the examples on visual studio .Net(version 7). Do yourself a favor. If you want to know how to use C++ with managed extensions, don't get this book. The title is misleading. As for newbies... this book will be a good reference for the C++ (non .Net) language."
1,Not really .NET,"The book spends the first 19 chapters on C++, which seems to me is not something I expect from a reference book (Herbert Schildt's C++: The Complete Reference suffices). When you get to Chapter 21, you realize that you're writing not using managed code, instead, you find yourself writing Win32 API's! The book should have focused on manage code, that's what Visual C++.NET is. If I wanted to read a book that focused on Win32 API's, I'd use another book. The book hardly focuses on managed code, which is the foundation of .NET (regardless of the language). I'm not at all surprised why I bought the book for $4.99 at my local bookstore."
1,Abridged,"They abridged Margery Allingham. How could they do that? The book isn't that long to start with. Also, important plot pieces are lost. I didn't even listen to it--I love the original too much. I just sent it back. But the package only has the abridgment in very tiny letters that don't show up on the order site, so I ordered 7 of them and had to return them all. It was disappointing, because my cassettes are wearing out, and I can't find unabridged versions to replace them on CD."
3,Hide my Eyes,"Disappointingly Campion only makes brief appearances in this adventure. A standard perfect murder plot. The two romantic leads were dull. The best thing about this are Gerry and Mrs Tassie. Their relationship was credible, touching and chilling in the last few chapters. Worth a read."
3,Michael Rother-'Chronicles Vol. 1'(Purple Pyramid/Cleopatra),"'Chronicles 1' is the first disc that I've ever heard from Michael Rother,who was one-time(make that short time)guitarist for Kraftwerk and then later was a key player in Neu! and Harmonia(see my reviews of all three of those band's CD reissues).'Chronicles Volume 1' features twelve tracks of some of Rother's prime material between 1977-93.The thirteen-minute ""Tiefenscharfe"" is nearly worth the price of admission alone.A couple of other standouts here were the snazzy electronic ""Pulsar"" and the acoustic ""Flammenda Herzen"" which I thought I heard some Floyd-like guitar.Not so much as krautrock here,as it's more like obscure in-depth thought-provoking guitar work.Believe that Rother STILL records and tours regularly to this day.Some of his music is a bit out-there,but very decent."
4,great cd,this cd is from the 90s when paula abdul was popular she sounds alot like paula abdul and the music sounds very similar if paula did not become a success I think Stacey would have been a biggerstar. I bought the cd because I love the song Romeo and Juliet one of my favourite songs on the cd
4,Excellent album!,"Stacy Earl's debut album is excellent, with the hit ""Love Me All Up"" a great dance / pop song. As an '80s ""one hit wonder"" it's sad she never came out with anything else as this artist definitely had a great voice, great looks, and great music."
3,One Hit Wonder -,"This album isn't that bad - It's okay if you're a pop fan - She a pretty lady but after coming out the same time as Shancice, Stacy Earl showed no signs of staying power -"
3,The Classic Freestyle is not to be missed!,"These sounds were the back-bone of my early days as a DJ in SoCal. Back in the mid 80's it was all about Miami Bass and Freestyle beats coming from Florida's and New York's club scenes. ""Jam the Box"" is classic ""Pretty"" Tony Butler. There are also some great classic cuts from other artist. If you're a fan of 80's dance music, please do yourself a favor and pick this up...."
5,Excellent for KID players and all 1. d4 players,"This entertaining and well-written book should have a large audience, as a huge percentage of chess players play king's indian systems all the time with black. This book pretty much describes everything white will throw at you (other than most traditional king's indian lines), including Torre Attacks, Trompowskys, Veresovs, Averbakh, Four Pawns (those last two are the only regular king's indian lines given), Barry Attack, London System, Blackmar-Diemer, and others. The book has lots of explanatory text and twenty-nine annotated games flesh out the main ideas. It is a repertoire book, meaning that the book focuses on recommended lines for black. Burgess' writing is, as always, clear, entertaining, instructive, and witty. The Batsford production is excellent. A fine chess book."
4,Edifying Shakti/Vedanta Text.,"A good English translation of an old hinduistic text of the shakta and vedanta tradition. The translator is a Sanskrit scholar who works for the Himmalayan International Institute of Yoga Science and Philosophy, which has been founded by Swami Rama, who wrote a nice book about his travels in the Himmalaya. The text uses Sanskrit terms frequently, but a glossary explains them all. The title Sakti Sadhana may confuse a little, because it's really just the translation of the Tripura Rahasya. The book consists mostly of teachings of Dattatreya about Vedanta with a touch of shakti. Carefully read it may contain some hints for the spiritual path. The book will be of best value, if one practices some form of Hinduism."
4,Back to the roots,"Hotel Costes 1 and 2 where the best presentation gifted DJ Poumpougnac could offer, 3 was different, more dance floor remixes, but then 4, 5 and 6 where probably an exploration of the unknown which, frankly, didn't reach the standards. Now, with Sept, he definitely reached his past, and has presented a varied, risky but amazing collection of songs that only he could offer. He has been in my home city recently (Madrid, Spain), and offered quite a horrible concert, but Sept is amazing. Rodney Hunters is probably one of the best tracks of all his collection, danceable but complex and non-tireable, track 7 is one of the best ""batucadas"" I've ever heard, and track 10 is an incredible sticky track you think you'0ve heard many times before. The rest, well fill in tracks, different, high quality down and high tempo that will keep you listening over and over again. The only fault, the mix between the songs is not too good, as it was in Hotel Costes 3."
4,A New Blend That is still Costes,"I hesitated in buying Costes 7 after reading so many bad reviews about it. The samples on Amazon weren't convincing either. Finally, I decided to get it last week because I received an online giftcard. I got it today and the album sounded a lot better than I expected! The soul of the Costes series is still here. Remember that Costes was never the same type of music, it was a mixture of genre and various artists. Over the years it has evolved from Hotel Costes to Costes Sept, and Mr. Pompougnac's choices must have evolved, too. I personally do not enjoy every single track, even though the full remix of ""The Sound of Silence"" gave me a better impression this time than the Amazon sample, it is still not my type. But if you just insert it into your car's CD player, only the beautiful vibes and the exquisite beats plus the wicked rhythms would matter."
4,Hotel Costes Keeps the Beat.,"This a good continouation of the previous albums from Hotel Costes. Songs like Lavish by Mark Rea, Heaven's Gonna Burn Your Eyes by Thievery Corporation Feat. Emiliana Torrini gave the cd the smooth lounge feeling and hits like Hip Hip Chin Chin (Yaziko Club Mix) by Club Des Belugas and Palumba by Watch TV is a good up beat to the overall cd. I gave it 4 stars as I found some tunes Clive the Runner and So Ma Guisee was not really to my liking.I would recommend it to all Costes lovers.Enjoy!"
2,Not good,"Too many unimaginative, unvarying beats, that go on forever, and the songs are often corny. Probably my least favorite from the HC series."
4,Dare I differ?,"I suppose it all comes down to personal taste, and after all, we are talking about the master of the genre, but I would have to give the first 8 tracks a 3 rating and the last 8 the usual Costes 5 rating. Trouble is, if I was in the club and lasted to #8, I think that track alone would get me out of my seat and off to another club...What was he thinking???Is it still worth buying? Of course !!!"
2,the worst of the HC series,"To my opinion, this is the worst of the HC series. I have bought all the 1-6 HC compilations during the past two years, but this one is not as good as I expected. Perhaps, Pompougnac has pushed himself to release a HC compilation every year without doing his best for its preparation. Maybe 10 releases (HC 1-7, best of HC, Living on the edge, Saks Fifth Avenue) are too many for a period of 6 years (since the first HC). I believe that the HC series should stop now, in order to avoid any further denigration of the series."
1,yuk!,I have all of the other Costes CDs and this one is totally lame. 1-5 were great. 6 was semi-lame and with this one I feel like he's just coasting knowing that suckers like me will be an easy target. I should've been suspect when there were no listening tracks available. Lesson learned -- no more buying blind! My suggestion is to try and hear it first before you buy...
1,worst compilation from stephane pompognac,"i bought this cd with great expectations and listened to it right away and i was disappointed big time. i love the series but this album is boring, doesn't even give you a feeling of a lounge where you are sipping your drink. I would much recommend the second and fifth in the series."
2,Listen Before Buying,"I am a fan of the earlier Costes series, but this disc has not got a single good cut on it. It was a gift, unfortunately."
3,Not quite up to par,"I actually bought this CD in Europe, I thought it would really enhance my trip while driving through La Mancha. It has a more retro style than the rest. Some tracks sounded out of place next to one another. Sorry to say this will not be uploaded to my iPod."
3,"Good, but there are better options ..","I was a big fan of the Hotel Costes series .. probably more of the Buddha bar series as well.. but Celestial is an upcoming fusion music mix thats quite good. And if you like that sound, then you'll love the albums from Hong Kong's Celestial. Check them out, they are titled:Hong Kong Dub StationHappy ValleySpirit HouseEnjoy the music!"
3,ok...,"hmmmm.....ok to me the only songs I like are ""hip hip chin chin"" and ""lavish"" I would perfer Vol. 1, and 2"
4,"One of his better CD's, but not the best","This CD is ok, some of the songs are great, while others are just ok. I suggest that you buy all of his CD's, but if you are a first timer to the series, I wouldn't suggest this CD. This is a good cd for after you have listened to some of his other ones."
2,please not again,"I agree with susan. this one is too lame. Doesn't he want to mix anymore ?? No.1-5 are great. what the point to make ""the best of costes"" anyway??"
3,This box set includes no singles,"Don't be fooled...this is the singles BOX, the interview cd, and the little booklet. I thought i was getting the deal of the century, but hey, too good to be true, yea?THERE ARE NO MUSIC CDS INCLUDED IN THIS PACKAGE.the amazon description says 'interview only cd' as opposed to 'interview cd only'....kind of misleading."
2,Best look at other filters before you buy this one,"I've owned a 55 gallon tank for over 10 years. By far, this has been the WORST filter I ever had. The constant filling and releasing of water in this filter is noisy to say the least. That is, if you can even position the cap inside the filter to get the thing working properly. It took me hours of fiddling to get this filter to work correctly.The additional heating source inside of the filter itself also turned into a nightmare. If you have frequent power shortages, or lose power from storms, or any other reason, this is not the filter for you. My heating component MELTED the plastic casing around it when our power failed, and the water stopped cycling through the tank. As no one was home at the time, we're lucky it didn't start a fire. Then by the time anyone noticed that the filter wasn't running, it have been a whole night. Not only was the tank water cloudy from going unfiltered, it was also cold.I don't reccomend this filter at all."
3,Amie: Encore Collection,"This is an eclectic collection of Pure Prairie League songs from peak periods. With contributions from early days and the band's 1981 rebound with Vince Gill, this album was a treat to listen to. However, aging rockers may recall when ""Falling In and Out of Love With You"" ALWAYS preceded ""Amie"" on AOR radio, and will be a bit dissappointed that both songs were not linked in this compilation, and may want to consider other PPL Greatest Hits collections."
4,Daily Inspiration,This book is so inspirational! I love that it has information that I can relate to. I recommended it to a very close and dear friend and he ordered himself a copy. We discuss what we've read whenever we can. Definitely worth the price you pay. I recommend it to everyone!!!
2,Much to be desired.,"This book is NOT what I expected. It is just full of one-sentence quotes and...that's it. The quotes are inspiring, but they don't assist in ""Walking the Red Road."" Its like a daily calader...but in book form. A let down."
1,Not what I expected,"I bought this book expecting it to be spiritual and some of the statements were, but they were not backed up with anything that relates to how the Indians incorporated those thoughts into THEIR daily lives. I just got an unrelated history lesson. For example, Feb. 10th-""To clothe a man falsley is to distress his spirit..."" Then the next information on that page is about a Native Day in American History on ""Feb 10th 1763 The French ceded the North Americans territory to England in the Treaty of Paris, ending the French and Indian War (1754-1763)."" Now, what do the two have to do with each other? Or at least put something in about how Native Americans dress or something related to the spiritual quote of the day. The format bugged me. There is some good information, but very poorly organized."
1,"embarrassing, naive, and profiteering",I am sure Terri Jean is a well-meaning person. But this is the kind of book that makes native people throw up. It tries to sell our spirituality for a profit. She doesn't have any real understanding of anything other than a spiritual hunger and a desire to make money. I am ashamed of this book.
2,Look elsewhere,"If you are looking for a book that actually instructs you on the spiritual path of the Native American people, look elsewhere. This book is nothing more than a ""quote a day book."" Purchase it if you're looking for a quick gift to bestow on someone, but not if you're serious about the ways of our native ancestors. In my opinion the product description is very misleading."
3,"Especially like the 12 Ethics, one for each month","I am enjoying this book. It's written as a daily message with a thought, a lesson and a bit of Native American history for each day. It also tells a very small bit about each season/direction and the associated color. What I like most is each month starts with an associated Ethic for following the Red Road. The following is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 5: the rather poor graphics and the limitations of the scope of the book, however for it's size and scope it is interesting and inspirational. I would recommend this book for ""beginners"" on the path of the Red Road."
2,Not what I had expected.,"Basically this book is just a bunch of insightful quotes and random facts about Native American history. Although the quotes and information are very wonderful, this is completely different then what I expected to read. Its more of an overload of info than it is a pleasant read. Some of the quotes even repeat itself. If you are really looking for a book to help you live on the red road, I would not recommend this. The title is misleading. If it was titled ""Great Native American Wisdom"" or ""Native American Words to Live by"" then the book would have been great. Needless to say I was disappointed."
4,365 Days of Walking the red road,This is a nice book for any year or every year. Helps you through each day of the year spiritual. I love this book.
5,Excellent Daily Guide,This is a wonderful book for anyone who follows The Red Road or has an interest in Native American spirituality. Short daily words or ideas to live by. Quotes and wisdom of the many tribes.
5,Day by Day Guide,I own this book so I was happy when I was able to download it on my Kindle. I read it daily. People who are seeking inspiration and guide day to day would like this book.
5,"So good, I kept it for myself",I have a friend who collects Native American books and I thought this would be a nice gift for her. When I got the book I looked in it and was real surprised at how much information was in there. It's alot! I learned alot just in the first month. I learned about Native American people I never knew existed and history of things I didnt know happened. I think teachers would also like this book because theres so much stuff in it to tell to kids. Anyway I bought her another copy and have this little gem by my computer desk so each day I can learn something new.
1,More New Age stuff,"As far as our background check went, Terri Jean is non-Native and a photographer from Cleveland. She is not a cultural fraud per se, but she is trying to make money off of Indigenous culture. This book offers no real insight to Indigenous Knowledge, but just basic information about Native spirituality that was thrown together."
2,For those looking for prechristian settled traditions...,"My ex boyfriend being part Blackfoot, getting to study under full native teachers I feel this book is a whitewashed version of a great and powerful thing. For anyone looking for prechristian settler Native American wisdom this is not the book."
5,daily inspiration,"Many years ago, I purchsed a book titled,""Simple Abundance"". It gave wonderful daily thoughts about the magic of ordinary days. This 365 day Red Road book mirrors that same theme, but with wonderful facts about Native Americans and provacative insights...........I love it!"
5,365 days of walking the red road,I love looking each day to see what the reading for the day is. Informative book of facts and quotes.
3,I'm scared of it.,"There are good ideas in here, but the tone of voice isn't as clear and warm as ""Ogilvy on Advertising.""Beyond Disruption seems designed to intimidate people with MBA's who commission creative services-or maybethat's my excuse for not slogging my way through the whole thing =)TBWA is one of the best ad agencies in the world, they do apple's global advertising and are led by Lee Clow,so for those reasons alone maybe I should finish the book and update this review later =)"
1,One of the worst CD's I have ever bought!,"If you buy this CD you will definitely regret it. The original versions of this song are amazing, but the covers by these no name garage bands are horrible. This CD is a disgrace to the Beatles and gives their great songs no respect!"
5,Great Book,"I have had two copies of this book at two different times. With each book ending up in the hands of friends. The book is very thought provoking. For anyone willing to step outside the norm of thinking, this is a good place to start. Very fast paced and engaging - even for a slower reader such as myself."
2,Sci Fi Metaphysics,"Esoteric metaphysics to battle the evil two-headed god and his cyclopean minions. Throw in some astral worlds, space ships, robots, cyborgs, and soul travel and we have a pretty wild sci fi here!I love science fiction, and metaphysics as well, so I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, the writing is really bad. The book did not flow for me at all, plowing through the pages to get the story was a real chore. Such a shame too, because I really liked the story. A good editor could have saved this book for me.The metaphysical nature of space and time is discussed ad nauseam. This stuff may have been new and interesting back when the book was published, but it seemed old hat to me now. The story really bogs down in it at times.I probably would have been better off with the comic book version...Entertainment: 3 starsEnlightenment: 2 stars"
2,Hack Writing At It's Best,The book has a very intriguing plot and does move along at good speed. There is action on every page. Twitchell's occassional allusions to great spiritual truths appear like fluff to add credence to a piece of hack writing. Character development is extremely poor. It's as if he wrote the piece as a pamphlet for his Eckankar idea. If you like L. Ron Hubbard's stuff you'll like this book.
4,VERY WELL WRITTEN AND RESEARCHED,"The other biography of Queen Mary that I had read years ago was Matriarch by Anne Edwards, which I had enjoyed, but the detail in this biography was absolutely amazing, particularly for Queen Mary's youth prior to her marriage. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the lack of detail in her later years as a widow, which was a stark contrast to the great detail earlier in the book. I would recommend this book over Matriarch any day. Pope-Hennessy was an excellent author."
5,A Must Have ......................,"This album is exciting and tasteful at the same time. It is also at times emphatic, at times delicate, but always classy. With only bass and drums to complement him, Charlie's virtuosity shines through.Naming particular tunes is largely pointless - it's all about the feel. But no-one has ever done ""It Don't Mean A Thing"" better, despite countless attempts."
2,Wish I would of known,I wish I would of known I needed a microscope to see this book. I needed a book to get some ideas for cake styles and I can barely see the cake let alone the details. It should have the book size in the description.
2,Wedding,"Bought this for my wedding, didn't end up using this or any pictured from it for my wedding, nothing inspiring was in it"
5,excellent compilation,"If you remember these guys from their heyday...and also remember the GREATEST HITS VOLUME 1 and 2....then you will really appreciate this 2 CD set...it has everything contained on those 2 discs and much more...and it is remastered...The sound quality is pure and clean...not over compressed..like so many ""remaster"" jobs are.I am shocked to see this going for as little as $4.99..I went and bought the complete catalogue of their material from the epic period of 1968-75..but this set is all the best material....I would also suggest grabbing the LIVE AT THE PARAMOUNT....there is a 3cd set out there...and it has everything here...plus a few other rare treats....Unless you are a completist...there's no reason to go beyond this cd and maybe the Paramount cd.."
4,Awesome songs.....Awesome memories,This is an awesome collection of work. The cd is a melodic history of The Guess Who in all of it's many incarnations and gives the listener insight into the consistency of musicianship through all of the talent that contributed to a truly great band.
2,"Boston Pops and Christmas are great, but avoid this disc","Please, if you are going to spend your money on a Fiedler and the Boston Pops Christmas disc - and every home should have one - then this is NOT the one to buy. This BMG Special Products release is short on selections and running time - around 32 minutes. For about one dollar more you can pick up the generously filledA Christmas Festivalwhich includes the ten tracks included here PLUS an additional seven numbers (over an hour music). Better yet, and also for only $1 more, isPops Christmas Partywhich features 21 selections (72 minutes) including six of the ten found here, another four popular numbers and eleven selections from Tchaikovsky's Nutracker.Again, for your best value avoid this release and purchase one of the other options provided above."
3,Celines Live Show Was Amazing,"I really just want to respond to a review which claims that Celine doesn't sing live at her show. I just had the pleasure of seeing her show and she has an amazing voice. She did not lip synch. As for the cd, it doesn't have all the songs that she sang at the show. And it has songs that she didn't perform at the show that I've seen. I know the show was changed so this cd is made from the earlier performances. I'd rather if it was from the current song list."
3,Pass The Dion...,"I think Celine is just mega fabulous. For some reason...she just seems so wrong that it's right. With the crop of ""live"" albums hitting the shelves of late; it's no suprise that Celine throws her hat into the ring. I must say that the effort seems a bit rushed and maybe shoulda kinda waited till her run in Las Vagas was over. My main issue with the set is the songs she picked to represent her show...where's the beef? The non-Celine tracks are good, but call me old fashioned...honey I want my Celine hits on my Celine CD. For her part, Celine does sound amazing and the music is studio caliber. Her new single ""You and I"" is stellar and it's a shame that it found the light of day of this release. I still love Celine, but I just know how to pick my battles from here on in."
2,Save your Money,"If you like listening to a live performance without the video than this one is for you... the DVD is just a teaser that has some interesting information about Celine, but doesn't have the live Las Vegas show I wanted to see. Again... save your money and wait until we can buy a DVD with her live stage performance that will have some entertainment value. I gave it two stars... very disappointed! C'mon Celine ... make it right for your fans... give us your live Las Vegas show on DVD! and make everyone happy!"
3,anew day cd,i like celindion cd a new day i just wish she would put more songs from her las vegas show in the cd like she did in the dvd. but it's still worth your while to purchase it. enjoy
4,Où est Jean-Jacques Goldman??,"Où est Jean-Jacques Goldman?? Je ne comprends pas. Où est Jean-Jacques Goldman sur cet album?? Elle chante et parle en mme temps. C'est honteux!!! Tu ne crois pas?? Haha. JUST KIDDING. Je recommande NATASHA ST-PIER AUSSI. Elle est très bon aussi!!! Oui mon nom est québécois, mais mon nom est canadien aussi!!! VIVE LE CANADA et à la prochaine fois...Jean-Francois Jacques Pierre Tremblay"
5,Brings back such wonderful memories of an amazing show....,".but,it was so much more than that.Her performance was flawless,perfect......all her crew,including musicians,and dancers made it such a magical evening.....this cd will bring it all back....enjoy!!!"
1,What a Waste,"There are few female vocalists that I've ever been WOW'ed by. Celine Dion was one of them. A beautiful voice whether solo or with a guest, Dion rarely disappointed me. Once she sold out to the LAS VEGAS glitz (remember this is the town that made WAYNE NEWTON a Star), I was dumb-founded. Why would such a successful, talented woman go to Las Vegas, the elephant graveyard for untalented people???? Oh well, whatever the reason, Las Vegas definitely affected Celine Dion. This album is dreadful. I saw her Las Vegas show on TV and couldn't pick my jaw up off the floor. Showgirls and showboys in cheesy costumes dancing around while Celine sang Disco! Buy ANYTHING but this mess and you can hear the beauty of her voice the way it was meant to be heard."
1,I've seen the concert !!!,"I didnt listent to this album yet, but i've seen her in las vegas!!!! and this show is not that good seriously... yes it is ok... but that is the the best show ever like many ppl think !! without the big screen at the back of the stage... there is no show !!! the screen and the dancers makes the show... not celine !"
5,Wonderful live cd!,"This is a masterpiece! Covering some old songs and performing some of her own repertory, fabulous Celine Dion manages one more time to achieve a true example of her live vocal abilities. A New Day.. Live in Las Vegas is Celine's fifth live album and the first english one for which it's a great oportunity to explore new territories and buy this fresh and always up-to-date record. Celine's voice is as strong as ever and this time with a new personal touch. Look forward to ""What a wonderful world"" ""I wish"" and ""Nature Boy"", my three faves... and also the two new studio tracks: ""You and I"" and ""Ain't gonna look the other way"", where the canadian showcases her diva-voice decorated with her usual ""vocal stunts"" and her late guitar style.A+++"
5,"If You Don't Have The Chance To Go To Vegas, Get This DVD","I had never been to Vegas, and I went with only 175.00 to spend. 1500 dollars later, thank you Star Wars Slot Machines and Men in Black Penny Machines!, I granted myself this wish to see Celine Dion. If you get to Las Vegas. see this amazing show."
4,Celine Live in Vegas!,"This is a live album which takes songs from her successful Vegas show, and offers fans a chance to enjoy it at home. There's also 2 new studio tracks. ""You And I"" is her current single, and it's doing well on the charts. The other song, ""Ain't Gonna Look The Other Way"", is a great song, fun uptempo positive song Celine has been known to record, especially on her last few albums. The live portion of the album is good. However, my one complaint is that there are not enough of her hits, and some of the ones on here are very short. It's nice to hear her sing the classics but I'd rather hear some of her big hits live, instead of ""Nature Boy"", ""At Last"", ""Fever"", or any number of songs. She did a good job on them at least. The best song live is ""My Heart Will Go On"". Overall a good album for the fans to own."
3,Minor disappointment,This live album is a minor disappointment to me for the following reasons 1 Not enough French songs 2 Not enough of her hit songs 3 Why didn't they capture the whole concert on 2 cds just like they did for Barbra Streisand's 1994 & 2000 live albums. The songs she should have sung: 1. Ce N'Etait Qu'un Rve 2 D'Amour Ou d'Amitié 3 Une Colombe 4 Where Does My Heart Beat Now 5 If You Asked Me To 6 Beauty & The Beast 7 The Power Of Love 8 Think Twice 9 To Love You More 10 Because You Loved Me 11 It's All Coming Back To Me Now 12 All By Myself 13 My Heart Will Go On 14 I'm Your Angel 15 A New Day Has Come 16 I'm Alive 17 I Drove All Night 18 Have You Ever Been In Love 19 One Heart 20 Tout l'or des hommes 21 Je t'aime encore 22 Contre nature 23 Ne bouge pas
1,Not the Show,"I was very disappointed in this cd. It was not the same as the show I had gone to see with my daughter on January 2006. I purchased 2 cd's, one for each of us...big mistake!"
1,I Never Expected!,"wow, I was really exited to hear this album (I'm glad I only bought it in cassette tape)but she sounds awful(honestly). I have watched her in Live in Memphis and The Colour of My Love Concert via VCD and she did a great job there, but here she provoked herself in singing such song like I Wish and other oldies specially What a Wonderful World in annoying way. Maybe she should sing in her original way. This even sell very low. Maybe she should made this album packed with the DVD like Linkin Park Live in Texas and she may reach even in GOLD RECORD! I wish Celine will be back in her original personality and start making great things aside from Las Vegas! Helo? How about us fans here around the world!"
3,Well...,"This was a pathetic attempt for her first live English language album. Most of the songs on the CD are covers, songs that were made famous YEARS before Celine came along.The included DVD is a teaser about the show.On the plus side, the full Vegas show will be released on DVD December 11th, 2007, FINALLY!!!"
4,Hidden in the Light,"This documentary provides a very interesting look inside the work of cinematographers. This function however essential in the art of filmmaking is not one that makes it to the frontpages of films magazines and theaudiences do not really realise what the work of these men and women is in a film.This film aims at presenting their work, especially the extent of their it, through close ups on particular films/persons.I had to see it for an Intro to Film studies class and I think it is a really good work, nevertheless it only gets 4 stars because it somehow lacks a bit of a sense of purpose. However, it is never boring, but just leaves you with a slight desire for something more.I would recommend it to any student in Film studies as well as to anyone interested in cinema for it is an agreeable film to watch and a very instructive one."
4,I like!,"Visions of Light provided me with a well-explained history of cinematography in Hollywood, starting with the old days (early 1900s) to film noir (Hollywood in the 40s) to the present time. However, I have to admit that I expected a more dynamic discussion about cinematography---a more ""passionate"" lesson on what makes good cinematography and its artistry. Also, it ends with films of the 60s or 70s...It doesn't go all the way to today's films.Nonetheless, I like it for what it teaches, and I'm glad I bought it. Hope this helps!-John"
5,Film School level documentary,"I first came to know about this film from my Film I professor who is also a working cinematographer. This documentary was very useful in helping me understand the key role of lighting in filmmaking. I recommend it to professionals, students and film enthusiasts alike."
3,Disappointing,"Not certain what the raves are about, essentially a collection of short clips (the color ones are terrible) and retired cinematographers presenting shallow irrelevant synopses of their lives and the film. Learned nothing about lighting theory, technique, cinematography, or any of the other expectations I had."
4,Great greeting cards,I was well satisfied with the cards. I would like to find the same product with 3-D embellishmemts.
3,Greeting Cards,"I love handmade greeting cards, so these were a little disappointing since they had no 3-dimensional additions. But the price was right."
2,Fascinating account of the relationship between 2 brothers.,"The book ""I Look Divine"" was very well-written and thought out. One would never expect a first time author to write like that. ""I Look Divine"" was the first book Christopher Coe has ever written. The words ran very smoothly and was very touching.It was very shocking also, for what happened in the end. It is worth reading if one can open the heart and understand it. :)"
4,worthwhile listen,"Surprised to see this album not getting more attention. Some real soul-jazz gems on here. Of course this is not the ""Classic"" Freddie Hubbard material from his Blue Note years, but it's still well performed music. Some interesting cover choices (""Wichita Lineman"" ... yeah!) help to make this a worthwhile listen."
4,Great for students anywhere.,"My 10th Standard students are using this book in their IGCSE English (Cambridge O levels) in India. It's very helpful that the words are presented in meaningful context. The passages are memorable, and the activities relevant. The students seem to enjoy the book too. Even though it's written for American students facing the SAT, this book is a good vocabulary-building tool for students anywhere."
5,More Painless Than Using Dictionary!,"Dealing with Painless series of BARRON'S, I came to learn more efficient ways to lighten my loads of my mind. Although Painless Vocabulary involves a lot of big words, I'm sure every exercise enhances your technique to build up your vocabulary and practice reading the contexts. You will be able to solve every brain ticker if you read the explanation of words BEFORE using your dictionary. And of course, Eng.-Jpn. dictionary and vice versa don't help. Both of them don't explain core meanings of each word, if you ask me. On top of that, it IS a waste of time and energy!After all, this book is going to help you reinforce your flexibility to tackle your new words!"
4,good book,good book if you want to review your vocabulary and build up a skill in writing english. It was easy to read and comprehend.
4,Miguel Morales DVD Review,"The selection of songs for this DVD is good, it would be excellent if they would have selected older songs from his beginning with Omar Geles and ""Los Diablitos"" that they did not. The quality of some of the videos is not that good due to the transfer from VHS to DVD format. Besides that, I think it is a good DVD."
2,"NICE LOOKING, BUT......","ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A DECORATION? OR ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A SILENT DOG WHISTLE THAT FUNCTION???? I WOULD ASK THAT QUESTION FIRST. THIS IS AN AVERAGE OK ITEM. I WOULD GO STAINLESS STEEL CONSTRUCTED WHISTLE. YOU ONLY BUY ONCE FOR A LIFE TIME~~! ALSO LOOK INTO THE ACTUAL FIELD TRIAL TEST RATING FOR QUALITY, FORGET THE LOOKS. SOUNDS FAMILIAR??"
5,THE BEST!!! No wonder about that. Delicious!!!,"You are the best ever made on this erth. I wish there was one exactly like you in my neighbourhood. Especially your voise, that's one of God's miracle!!!"
3,Pastor's perspective,"There is some good material in this particular book, however it was not as good as some of Stanley's other stuff. I found his book, ""The Best Question Ever"" more informative, with more of a practical application. Obviouly the man is an extremely talented writer."
2,BUY THE PAPERBACK!,"This is an excellent book, but I cannot recommend the Kindle edition. Again, it's a good read, but buy the paperback.I suspect that this electronic version was published without being proofread. There were so many mistakes throughout the book--e.g., missing apostrophes, ""you'll"" rendered as ""you 11,"" and other words that were unintelligible--that it was distracting. There were times when I had to consult my husband's paper copy just to make sure I understood a sentence or phrase as it should have been written. Please understand that the comprehension difficulties had nothing to do with Mr. Stanley's argument or writing style, they were completely due to a horrible rendering of the text into the Kindle version.I enjoy my Kindle. I prefer to read on it. However, I find it extremely frustrating when I come across a book that has been released with so many mistakes. No editor worth her salt would allow this to happen in the ""paper world,"" why should it be allowed in the e-world?"
1,Chinese junk!!!!,"I Received this pedometer as a gift and was excited to use it. The manual is so fine print and is a booklet only 2"" by 1.5"" so you can imagine how hard it is to read. The book really does not match the images of the instrument in some cases. I had to use a magnifier to read the fine print of the ""mode settings"". Furthermore the settings and mode buttons would not work. I could not get the thing to respond according to the directions. It could need a new battery, but I don't think so because the time etc. would blink, but not change. As an engineer I do believe this instrument to be a piece of Chinese junk that is not worth your money. There are a lot better instruments on the market. There is always the chance I received a lemon. New Balance should be ashamed to sell such a poorly engineered instrument. Consumers must choose wisely....TedTed"
2,Poor instructions,1.The operating instructions user very poor. Had to contact the manufacturer for instructions on how to reset the unit.2. The product description was not very accurate
1,Lousy Pedometer,"You have to be a rocket scientist to use this pedometer. It is hard to set, and doesn't work properly. I couldn't even get it to record steps, which is my main purpose for having a pedometer. Maybe if you want to use it for marathons, it's OK, but it's no good for just tracking steps on a daily basis. I'm shipping it back tomorrow. Don't waste your money."
3,Good Product,"It is a very nice step counter but it does not keep track of the daily steps, could be a little better!"
3,"works well, but panic alarm hasn't been useful","This product works fine, but I wish I hadn't gotten the panic alarm version. The alarm sticks out in an awkward way, and there's no way to remove it without sounding it off. It also seemed to fall off easily when I bumped it."
4,New Balance Step,"This product is amazing! I take it to the gym with me to count my steps and I got to say, it is worth it. It is small,but has a great grip on pants:] I say it's a perfect item for someone who's getting on track for the new year!"
4,Ooooh Soothing,"I swear by this stuff and so should you! Nothing comes close after a long day at work and a even longer night at home with the kits. Seems like I never get to sit down and relax. When I do, this always, always does the trick."
3,Diana's death - truth or fiction,I saw this originally on tv and wasn't sure why Dodie's dad really believed that the Royals were out to kill Diana. I added this to my collection only to have a record of what people were thinking at the time of her death. It's an ok piece to have but there are more documentaries out there that cover it better.
3,science fiction,it was a good read for a rainy afternoon... can't say that it kept me spellbound... but had to continue since I wanted to finish the series.
4,Scary,I love Barbara Hambly's body of work - I am just sorry she moved into historical fiction as I don't care for that nearly as much but the entire Sun Wolf/Starhawk series I have re-read at least 3 times and I truly enjoy it more each time
1,Not for Business Use!,"RCA advertises this phone for small businesses. It's not working for us!! We bought one 4-line with answering machine, two 4-line without answering machine, and one handset. The chief complaints are:The answering machine is on the receptionist's phone. Once she picks up one line on that phone, the answering machine will not pick up any other line that rings. That's precisely why we need an answering machine!!Following RCA instructions, we ""registered"" the handset to the receptionist's phone. RCA doesn't tell you that registering the handset to a particular base precludes using that base and the handset at the same time. For example, if the receptionist is on any line, no one can use the handset, even though it's a 4-line phone system.We contacted RCA's customer service about how to fix these issues. The representative (located who knows where) responded to both with, ""You can't."""
2,Its 2012 and we still use this phone so i thought i would review it,"Basically this phone is alright, but definitely wouldn't recommend.as others have mentioned, no matter how many lines you have, this unit is only capable of one call at a time. If you have a wireless extension to this base, you can still only use one at a time. Yes either the wireless or the base but not both!I had much trouble figuring out how to transfer a call from the headset to the wireless station."
4,great stuff,"Worth the price for two reasons- Lee Hays, who, well, RULES, and the BREATHTAKING spur-of-the-moment duet between Ronnie Gilbert and Hollie Near. Holy COW, your jaw will drop... Otherwise, really quaint and moving and full of quirky humor and wisdom."
5,Folk singing at it's best,"I just saw this on PBS, a celebration of 30 years since the filming of this program and it is as wonderful now as it was then. There are new interviews with the remaining group members, and people associated with the original program.The music is as wonderful as the people and they still believe in justice in our world, and freedom. I am waiting for this to come out on DVD to replace my tired old video tape, please don't keep us waiting too long PBS."
4,Ambitious album from a singer whose voice gleams,"Thank goodness Patricia O'Callaghan's talents aren't hidden away at some expensive opera house for only a few to hear, though her style and technique would certainly be appreciated in such a setting. Instead, this bad-ass chanteuse has chosen the bold path of Cabaret Singer.So, as on this album, she immerses herself in good, but not typical songs: Leonard Cohen, Kurt Weill, and Pearl Jam. And here's a rare talent: she actually GETS the lyrics and the music. She wraps her voice around the songs with appropriately intense dynamics and phrasing.""Real Emotional Girl"" is an album for those who don't need preset labels for their music: when great songs, great singing, and interesting arrangements are enough. It's a real treat. Patricia O'Callaghan is a singer with a strong, beautifully clear voice and heck of a lot of grit."
2,Two stars for trying,"I bought this CD thinking I'd found something by an innovative/experimental jazz singer who was willing to tackle songs by Eddie Vedder and Bob Dylan. What I heard was a recording by an opera singer -- yes, the overly precise enunciation, lack of vocal innovation, and demurely ""crystalline"" tones -- who scores points for trying something like this, but is doomed to failure. I've seen so many comedians do ""opera singer tries to get soulful"" skits that this CD, for me, teetered on the edge of self-parody."
1,Not as pictured!,"These hangers are not what they appear. They are not curved, nor semi-curved. They are flat. They have a rough pants bar, which would mess up your pants if you hang them on the pants bar. The wood is cheap and not thick at all. Do not buy this unless you want cheap crap."
3,Decent Hangers,"The quality is okay, a little bit of finish sanding wouldn't hurt. I wouldn't call these suit hangers because the hangers are pretty thin, approximately 1/2"" thick. I was going to use these for my suits, but will instead use them for shirts. I am going to try to find ones that get thicker in the shoulder area for my suits."
5,Live Big Band with Joe Williams,"Not too much additional can be said that wasn't covered by beeper99 in the earlier writeup. I also had this originally on vinyl and I also believe that ""Joe's Blues"" is one of the best cuts ever recorded by Joe Williams. Joe was in great form that night....probably in the best period of his magnificent career!The other cuts are very good..... the band was really cooking that night. Another highlight of the session was Benny Carter's ""Souvenir"" with the solo by the great alto saxist Marshal Royal."
3,Lots of Good Insights but rigid .,"Smalley has alot of good insights but he is too rigid ,he places all of the responsibility on the husband . For a more balanced view try Haltzmans Secrets of Happily Married men or Michelle Weiner Davis ."
1,Very sexist,"This book is written by a OLD man. His views express a time when life was good for men and hard for women. If the traditional marriage was such a nifty niche for women, then why aren't they still there? This book will only be satisying to men and the elderly. You will see alot more of these types of books in the future as men desperately try to hang on to the oppressively patriarchal society they created with their might makes right world order . As you can see, it's backfiring."
5,One of the very best how-to marriage books I've read,"This is an excellent resource for applying great marriage principles into marriage. These ideas are real marriage enhancers that can help anyone, whether the marriage is on the rocks or doing ok. I can agree with most theories on marriage, but this book gives actual hands-on advice that will transform your marriage"
4,Kelly Preston is an underrated sex symbol,"This movie is a must for any Kelly Preston fan. In it, she plays a sly once-upon-a-time prostitute whom gets what she wants by giving every man (in the film) what they want. The main character can't be blamed for his stupidity when you put yourself in his shoes. If Kelly Preston came into a shower with you..............you get the idea. It's a nice frolic and a good companion to her other b-style movies: Love is a Gun, and Mischief."
4,about double cross......,"too bad, no DVD or VCD....what I can say is little story with multiple sex scene which pulls for a few minutes for each scene....those whom like to watch sex movies, I would recommend this. Rating for sex scene is 4 and storyline is only rated 2 star...."
2,Product satisfaction,"Incorrect movie purchase. Was not the movie I was researching for to purchase. I was looking for something a little more different, but same sexiness of kelly preston."
3,Not Horrible,"I had to write to offset the previous review. No, it's not a great album, but it's not horrible. These are acts known to everybody who grew up in the 70's, are contemporaries (and sometimes freinds) of Bob, and it's interesting to hear their takes on the songs. None of these performances were recorded in the 1990's (although that's when the CD was released). I collect Dylan covers and I really appreciate this set being released on CD. Regarding Odetta's version of Times A-Changin': she has vocal style that no one is lukewarm about. Either you like it or can't stand it (just like with Dylan)."
2,cell phone batteries,I purchased this batter to replace 2 batteries in 2 phones that I used for quite awhile. We got years of use out of the original batteries. The new batteries do not last near as long. I would say they last about 20 minutes. When I know I will be on the phone for awhile ( i.e. calling the computer company to get help and they put you on hold forever)I always have one of my other phones for back-up. I think there is a more expensive battery you can buy that probably last longer. Probably better to spend the extra money for the more expensive battery. I really don't recommend this battery.
5,When You Believe,"Doris Walker works at Macy's. She's in charge of choosing people to be in the parade, but when her Santa Claus shows up drunk she fires him and hires Kris Kringle on the spot. Kris believes he's Santa Claus, and Doris not believing in anything ignores his insistent opinion.Of course, Doris has her 6 year old daughter Susan thinking there's no Santa Claus either, and Kris makes sure he changes the little girls mind. But trouble begins when he is admitted to Bellevue, a mental institution, and now with the help of his friend Fred, he must try to get out or Christmas will be ruined for everyone. Especially little Susan.This book is truly wonderful, and it shows that if you just believe anything is possible."
4,obscure film gets it's release.,"Unlike other reviewers, this dvd is not bad at all. it is a public domain print but much better than other domain prints i have seen. Jef films can be a little pricey but they do release obscure titles. music score is very good quality on this one. The print quality is not bad and is from direct 16mm reduction print transfer."
5,A Great Way To Catch Up,"I just love these Essential books. It's a great way to catch up on the back issues that you couldn't read because you weren't born yet (1979 for me). I've read vols 1-7 and vol 8 is waiting to be read. The storys are fun to read may favorite story from vol 1 is #14 The Green Goblin, vol 2 #39 How Green Was Ny Goblin Vol 3 #50 Spider-Man No More Vol 4 #89 Doc Ock Lives Vol 5 # The Man or The Spider Vol 6 #121 The Night Gwen Stacy Died Vol 7 #150 Spider-Man or Spider-Clone. I can't wait till i get all the other Essential Spider-Man books."
5,Get over the B&W,"Yes, it is somewhat of an annoyance that these books arent in color but I think fans should be grateful we have access to so much content for so little money. Marvel Essentials are a HUFE blessing to comic fans. Especially young ones who want to experience comic books from their very first run up until the present. The only thing I can see fans complaining about is that the binding is rather poor, but I've only experienced this a few times considering I have numerous Essentials volumes and DC showcase books. I have about 25 overall and I've only had binding problems with 2 of them."
4,New York in the 1960s,"Steve Ditko was a New Yorker through and through and these comics offer many beautiful streetscapes, some from the street and others from the web-swinger's perspective.Highly recommended for anyone who has had to leave New York!"
2,"Black and white Reprints, a waste of money.","The reprints are in Black and White. If this is what you want to waste your money in then so be it. Me, I'll keep my money."
5,The originals are always better,"I had never read these original stories before. They are great and it was a wonderful experience to read them. Besides the fantastic elements in this story, Lee is able to add some soap opera elements with Peter's romantic relationship with Betty Brant. It gets quite dramatic when Betty makes Spiderman responsible for killing her brother, just when Peter is about to reveal to her that he is Spiderman. Later on, other obstacles will be on the way between the two, like Liz Allan's sudden change of heart for Peter Parker.I'm also impressed by the compositional skills of Lee. considering that these comics were meant to be sold to a young audience, 8 to 12, the vocabulary is varied and demanding. When compared to the texts of The Ultimate Spiderman, the language has a higher standard."
2,WAY TOO HOT! A Waste of space and money!,I bought this crockpot and after several months of trying to figure it out I QUIT! I am not home to check on it. That is why I use a crockpot. SO dinner can be ready when I get home. So staying home to watch it is out of the question. Then why use a crockpot? I am looking at getting rid of it and calling the company to see if there is a recall. If there isnt there should be one! I think it is too dangerous to use. I am now looking at other makers of crockpots. I will never own another Rival. This crockpot was a waste of my money!
1,Poor Purchase,"The handle broke a short time after I had the crockpot. When attempting to replace the lid from rival, the crockpot parts costs almost the price of a new crockpot. Also, the temperature on the low cooking is not accurate."
3,This is a BIG pot!,"This is a well built piece. Works as advertised. Have yet to use the ""Duet Insert"" 2 sided insert. The programmable feature is nice.I should have gotten one of the smaller 4qt pots. This is a big boy, and while you certinly don't lose anything by not filling it, it does take up a lot of storage space in the cabinet."
4,"Great, except for the 'keep warm' feature","I got this for Christmas and love the dual cooking chamber insert as well as the automatic timer feature. I find the size is perfect for stews, soups, roasts and other large items. I made a Jambalaya for 8 right in the large dish and made it again for four, so I find it very versitile for all cooking needs. The dual chamber is perfect for a small roast with a side such as sour kraut if you want to keep the two separate.My only complaint is the keep warm feature. It seems to heat items as hot as the 'slow' feature and liquids continue to rapidly boil. I had a smaller, very old crock pot, and this one is definitely easier to use. I would recommend it with the exception of the keep warm feature. It's also easy to clean."
2,Poor Temperature control,"I have had this crockpot for sometime now and the worst thing about it is that the ""low"" and ""keep Warm"" temperature settings are both too hot. Liquids will boil and boil on either of the settings. I think of ""keep warm"" as just that, not continue cooking. I'm not happy at all with my purchase of this item. The size is the best thing about this crockpot. I hope to find one that works better. Consumer Reports doesn't rate this crockpot very good either, which they wrote up after I had already had this one for sometime."
2,Disappointed .. to say the least,I was very disappointed in this CD. Heard a bit of it on the radio and then ordered the entire CD. Just not as funny as I had hoped. Good idea and format though. Maybe Willie should find a writer before he makes his next call
1,Surprise! A dangerous book,"The author tries to make the subject easier than it can be made. He does mention general concepts but does not mention under what circumstances these hold. The danger comes when you try to implement it. Of course you get an answer but as the author puts it himself: ""surprise!"" the answer is wrong because you were not told about the validity of your assumptions. As an example take the issue of the discrete noise covariance matrix i.e. Q. The author gives a simple recipe for constructing this matrix. But he does not tell you that it is only valid for small step size. If you try larger time steps you are in big trouble. The book contains occasional insightful remarks. Also the same filter has several different names in the same paragraph, which can cause confusion."
4,Comfortable but...,"I got these flip-flops and I was really excited - perfect size, very comfortable, very nice looking, too. However, despite the fact that they feel soooo comfortable, I got blisters... I am hoping, though, that it is simply a new shoes thing as it happens to me, because they are seriously very comfortable, comparable to Dr. Scholls, I'd say."
5,Just What I Wanted,"I was looking for a pair of flip flops that had good support and shock absorption and I found them! I wear my Tangos everywhere, even shopping and I have never done that before. As a bonus feature I wanted an insole that would not get slippery when I got them wet while working in the yard or around the pool, etc. The Tango insole works great for me. I don't usually write reviews on things I purchase but I felt like I needed to share this with anyone who had the same needs as me. I am over 50, have had problems with both of my knees and am overweight. Thanks Columbia Sports Wear!"
1,"Great looking shoe, but bad fit.","The shoe looked great, but didn't fit at all. I ordered a size 7. The strap was so tight that I could barely get my foot into it. Was gonna give them to my mom, who usually wears a smaller size than myself, but she said the same thing. So I exchanged them for an 8. The same deal all over again. Wasted time was all this shoe gave me. I have a pair of Columbia flip flips already, had them for about 13-14 years. They wear well and would still be in good shape but my puppy got them. I just wanted some that looked newer. Columbia has good shoes, just not this particular one."
5,Excellent shirt,"Still wearing this bad boy 6 years after buying it. Color still looks great. Random Rush fans always comment on it. One of the best albums,"
3,There are better deals,"The playing of Parker and his groups here, from his early years as a leader (1946-1947) deserves 5 stars - there's no argument here !BUT, why settle for 12 songs when there is ""In a soulful mood"" which contains all 12 plus 6 extra tunes with great sound quality - and at a lower price. If this is not available than there is the Ken Burns collection which is awesome.If you bought this one you bought the greatest music - but there's no reason to make such a short CD unless it's a real bargain price - which it's not."
4,"a good beginning... but not, I think, the whole story","I liked this book and feel that I will benefit from it, but it doesn't seem to be the whole story. There would seem to be many other places in the world where your dollars stretch. But for a beginning look at the areas in the world where you can get more bang for your buck, this is a good book. I recommend it, but I am also going to keep looking for others, just to get a more balanced point of view and other recommendations."
5,awesome book,I had plans on following this book's advice and they listed so many wonderful places to go but now I don't have the book as my sister threw it out after I had to abandon my home due to a domestic violence situation. I would recommend this book to anyone and will buy another one when my finances and situation is back in order to travel again.
3,NOT for Business Money 2005,"I bought this book to go with the Business version of Money 2005. When I opened up the package from Amazon, I was disappointed to find that this book does not cover Business Money. Now, I've got to go through the hassle of packaging it back up for a refund. Thought I'd spare you the same experience.I already have the 2003 version of this book, and found that one to be a great help in getting familiar with the old program. It's written for beginning users and some of the tips are real time-savers. However, the chapters about basic record-keeping information for small business owners are unnecessary filler. The 2005 version looks to be pretty much the same as the one I have. So if you're just doing personal finance tracking with Money, it's handy to have.Now, if someone would please write an easy book for businesses that use Money!"
4,Only $80 when bought from flowbee and no CA tax,"I have used a flowbee since the early 90's I think I paid $49.00 then. Since I had to purchase a whole set of spacers because the tapered one broke and they don't sell individual pieces, New cutters, probably because I ran it a few times without oil, and oil. That's it! I keep my hair short at 1 1/2 inches and taper it over my ears and on the back. I have had compliments on my hair cuts. I suppose that 26 cuts per year for about 25 years for maybe 75 bucks total is a pretty good deal. At $130 it is also a good deal but Flowbee sells it for $79.00"
1,Don't buy from this Vendor,"Yes, the flowbee is a great unit. No, the Flowbee sold here is sold for much, much more than even from the Flowbee website [...]Just buy direct and save money."
1,Not nearly as good as original,"I used the original flowbee for many many trouble free years and finally the blades were getting dull and the head was held together with rubber bands. So I broke down and bought a new one. The new model is not as strong as the old model, blades move slower and blades are dull. Takes much longer to cut hair than original."
5,I haven't been in a barber's chair in 18 years,"I retired a commander in the US Navy in 1994. I cut my own hair my last 2 years on active duty and continuously since then. That's at least 432 haircuts at $15 each. My Flowbee has saved me at least $6480 and 432 trips to the barber. My haircuts have always been very neat and militarily acceptable. My time is worth something as well. Typically, I am finished with my Flowbee in less time than it would have taken to drive to the barbershop. If this doesn't convince you to get a Flowbee, ask yourself this question: Have you ever seen your barber wash his hands before he started cutting your hair? The comb soaks in the blue liquid, but what, exactly, cleans the clipper? Or the scissors? Is that straight razor ever sanitized between customers? GET A FLOWBEE!! (and a Dyson)."
3,maybe,"i used the weed wacker ... errrr ... flowbee for the first time recently. did it all by my ownself. then my partner checked it out. still needs scissor trim above the ears and the back looks kinda funky. but that's just fine i guess. in the long-run, i do believe i'll return to the barber shop as i have for many a'year. i'll flowbee the grandkids."
1,"This merchant is a ripp off. Beware, Beware, Beware.","This item for the price of $116, according to the manufacturer of Flowbee is supposed to include the vacuum. The picture in the add has a vacuum that attaches to the hose. The merchant insists it is not there picture, & that you have to go by the main picture, not the insets. Don't buy from this merchant, buy from the manufacturer direct.This prooduct actually works well, but you have to connect it to your wife's vacuum"
1,long ago,Long ago there was a vision of making church cool. What was cool then now just looks campy. Time to let go of games-based curriculum.
4,"Good, solid read - definitely a keeper!","This was a very good book. It is well written and complete unto itself. A relief in this epic rich genre. I hope to see more of Kerr's work, and soon."
4,Written with knowledgeable details of Old West.,"Johnny D. Boggs writes with a knowledge of details of the Old West that is seldom found in today's writers. Few are will to make the exhausting efforts in research to insure their readers are getting the most accurate depiction of the Old West. Boggs always delivers.Add to Boggs' attention to details, the fast paced and twisting story line, and it is another stay-up-all-night-and-finish-it-in-one-read book. The characters are well developed and interact naturally, lending credibility to the story line.I'm always waiting for the next.Will"
2,Somehow it leak at the connector,"I had a professional to install this faucet. The installation seemed rather straight forward and nice. After we had everything connected, we found that it leaks at the ""easy"" connector part. We had no idea why and I hope the handyman is able to find a solution. Disappointed"
1,Leaks like a sieve after 2 weeks and no help from Kohler,"Feels cheap (pull out part is very lightweight plastic) and started leaking up top right after we installed. Kohler customer service wouldn't even bother to respond with a corporate form letter to my complaint, so now I need to warn all of you to avoid this faucet like the plague. For $200 a faucet ought to be a lot better than this one and so if you buy it do so at your own risk. I've bought any number of plumbing fixtures in the past year for upgrades and renovation projects around the house and this thing was the easily the worst quality and apparently Kohler doesn't care about the individual consumer who wastes their time and money on this product. PLEASE! I beg you- save yourself a lot of frustration and disappointment - don't buy the Kohler Forte K-10433-VS."
4,Looks good,"The faucet looks good. My only criticism is that it seems to splash a bit. The pull-out feature is very nice and the mechanism for switching from spray to stream works well. You definitely need good water pressure since the restricting mechanism isn't in the parts list and isn't obvious. I thought the Vibrant Stainless would be more trouble free but if you want it to look good, plan on wiping it after the dishes are done."
4,NICE KITCHEN FAUCET,"KOHLER; FORTE SINGLE CONTROL HANDLE PULL-OUT SPRAY FAUCET #10433-CP.GREAT KITCHEN FAUCET, CAME WITH EVERYTHINGS. FAUCET BODY HEAVY METAL, FAUCET SPRAY HEAD IS MADE OF MOLDED PLASTIC. INSTALLATION WAS SIMPLE AND EASY. THE MAIN HOT AND COLD INLINE FLEXIBLE HOSE WAS LONG ENOUGH AND PROVIDE EASY HOOK-UP. THE INSTRUCTION SHEET WAS SIMPLE TO FOLLOW, IF YOU ARE GOOD HANDYMAN TO BEGIN WITH. GETTTNG UNDER THE SINK IS ALWAYS A CHALLENGE. THE FAUCET SPRAY IS GOOD, STRAIGHT FLOW IS LITTLE SLOW DUE TO RESTRICTED PASSAGE IN FAUCET HEAD SWIVEL."
3,Just OK,Attractive and relatively easy to install. Quality not as good as we expected. We'll have to wait and see how it holds up.
5,Excellent product!,"This is an excellent faucet. It was easy to install and the curve of the faucet is tall enough to allow pots to be filled or rinsed without hassles. The spray is heavy and it takes some ""playing"" with it to adjust it, but once we larned how to do that, it's great! We're very happy with the Koehler Faucet."
2,Leaks after less than 2 years use !!!,I bought this faucet less than 2 years ago for over $200 and expected it to be a long lasting high quality product.Boy was I wrong. The pullout hose has been replaced twice due to leakage at the pivot where it connects to the head. I would buy delta if I had it to do over!
5,Kohler Faucet,I received the item in a timely manner. It is exactly what I ordered. I will continue to use Amazon.
1,Last Kohler I will buy,I purchased this Kohler faucet for a remodel. It was the worst decision I could make.I will never buy another Kohler product. They have really gone down hill.
4,Great Faucet,"This is a nice faucet and the price is fair for the quality. I was unsure about what the vibrant stainless finish would be. I wanted more of a satin nickel, and this is what this looks like. If you want shiny stainless, you will be disappointed."
3,high arch,"The arch of this faucet is high relative to older models which is nice if your sink is 8-9 inches deep; not necessary is sink depth is 10"" or greater."
1,"Nice looking, but abysmal quality","We went to Home Depot and purchased the Kohler K-10433 VS and paid about $213.00 (tax included). It was pretty easy to install, however, the hoses were too short! We had to go to Ace and then Home Depot to get extensions. When all was connected, the hot water did not come out. My husband took the handle off and repositioned the indexer to stop the valve stem at the desired maximum temperature (hot) and then put it back together three times according to directions. No hot water! This took over 90 minutes and no luck. We then looked at the many negative 1-star reviews on this product and decided to return it. We spent a total of 3 days --- Labor Day weekend --- trying to get our kitchen faucet to work. I do not know if this product was ever tested before packaging, or whether it was made in China. Poor quality product."
3,suposed to be top of the line but keeps comming loose,We bought it new almost 4 years ago so I guess it has held up pretty well so far. The problem we hae is that the bolt keeps comming lose and you have to tightening it a certain way so it wont leak. ITs not too bad but certainly not as good as the price would lead you to beleive.
4,"clean look, smooth pull out","got it for tenants' unit when I remodeled their kitchen. It looks quite reliable, and the pull out faucet is very smooth. wish they had it in a matte finish or satin nickle."
1,w. moore,"I got a Kohler kitchen faucet three years ago. I thought why not get the best! After a few months the faucets rotating ability began to stiffen, and now it feels like you are going to practically break it to go from sink-to-sink. No more Kohlers for me!!"
2,"Love The Style And Feel, But Didn't Last","We have had this Kohler Forte faucet for about 2 years. I really love the looks of it and the way it feels in my hand when I pull out the sprayer to use it. The single handle is easy to use and to control the water temp, and generally I am very happy with it.Except - after about a year the swivel function froze up like other reviewers have mentioned. You could still turn it from side to side but it was a major effort. DH called Kohler and they sent him some free parts, which of course didn't fix anything. We held off on buying a new faucet because we wanted to remodel the kitchen and wanted to wait to make sure the new faucet matched the rest of the kitchen. Luckily the pullout works fine, because it was often easier to pull that out than to try to swivel the faucet.We are in the remodeling process now and I am shopping for a new faucet. I will NOT be buying this one again even though I love the form and function - I just don't trust it to last very long."
1,Faucet freezes up - can't move side to side,"We've had two of these faucets in the last 6 years, and guess what, the second one is failing - same problem as the first, the faucet freezes and you can no longer move it side to side. I didn't even bother calling Kohler this time around. We are just replacing it with something else, which is too bad, because it is a really nice looking faucet. However, spend your money elsewhere, this one won't hold up after 2-3 years."
1,Missing part,"We love the faucet but it was missing a very important part, no time to send it back.We found a replacement part at the hardware store:("
1,broke after 4 years,"The plastic part in the cartridge broke off after 4 years of use. The top handle just comes off now. If you look inside, it's all plastic and apparently it broke off from fatigue..."
2,This faucet splashes and has a bad flow rate,"The other people on here are correct. I have no issues with water pressure and this faucet does not put out the pressure expected. Also, There is a big splashing issue that gets water everywhere. I would definitely think twice before purchasing this faucet.\I did try replacing the head after speaking with Kohler but that did not resolve the issue. New faucet is on order."
5,"Beautifully designed, good quality","The Kohler Forte is in every respects superior to the Moen single control, pullout faucet that it replaced in our kitchen, at about the same price:- higher curved spout provides greater under-clearance- handle action smoother, more responsive and precise- spray head attached by nylon tubing with ball-joint swivel- very fluid action and easy to maneuver in and out; push-button spray has positive feel; heavy metal counter-weight- pedestal swivels freely on base with single-hole installation- very easy installation- elegant design and quality feel"
1,Do not buy!,"Only lasted 3 years before swivel at base began heavily dragging, and now will not rotate at all. Lifetime warranties mean nothing when the labor to replace is so high. It s so mch work to fix, i am just going to buy a new faucet of another brand."
4,almost,"I have installed many kitchen faucets in my 83 years, but this was by far the easiest. The only problem I have with the device is the splash. No air gets mixed with the water stream (in either mode) and as a result the water splashes out of the sink unless the volume is cut way back. The effect is worsened by the fact that much more water comes out than any other faucet I have used. Changing the aerator didn't help, apparently because the aerator is recessed into the spout and air cannot get into it.It is, by far, the most beautiful faucet I have owned--an eyeopener."
3,Awkward Design and Very Splashy (Not in a Good Way),"I bought this faucet to go with a deep stainless steel sink by Kohler. After years of having a separate sprayer, I was happy to have such a clean, modern silhouette. I quickly discovered how awkward this faucet is to use in ""spray"" mode -- the old style sprayers can be operated with one hand, but this one requires two. Look at it. It should have been obvious to me. If you want to switch from regular to spray mode, it actually requires three hands. I'm used to just grabbing the sprayer and going.My other complaint about this faucet is that the ""focal length,"" for lack of a better term, is wrong for deep sinks. By ""focal length"" I mean the set-up of the aerator in the head so that there is minimal splashing from the faucet when it's in the ""docked"" position. This thing is very, very, splashy. I like the look of the faucet, but I'm hoping the countertop guys can drill another hole for a regular sprayer so I can get rid of it."
2,kohler forte kitchen faucet,"We bought this faucet for our kitchen remodel in '08. Shortly after installation, one of the faucet spray buttons on the pullout fell out. This is a plastic part which breaks easily after little use. Kohler sent us replacement buttons free after I complained about the poor design. Within a few months, the same button fell off. This is a faulty design which needs to be addressed. Kohler makes premium-grade products, and as such, should protect their reputation vis-a-vis the money they demand. This is a faulty product which should be pulled from their inventory; I hope that it is. John"
5,Quality and stylish,"This faucet set is a solid performer. After going through three faucets in five years, I installed this Kohler piece in the kitchen. It is high enough to increaswe the work space in the sink, in fact it feel like I have a new, larger sink; it is not so high as to obstruct the view out the kitchen window.This is a quality product, and should last for years. It replaces a similar style faucet bought at Costco that would not stay on, and before that an Italian fauct which broke the day before Thanksgiving spraying water everywhere. According to the handman, every part of the Kohler is repairable, unlike my prior faucets which were total write-offs. Buy Kohler for quality and save in the long run.Quality product,"
2,"Looks Nice, but this product is not up to Kohler standards","I am an experienced general contractor and put 100% Kohler Forte plumbing fixtures, Kohler tub, sink, shower, etc in my own home. This is the only Kohler product I am not happy with. When new it seemed to work great. With age (1year) the Pull Out faucet won't go all the way back in and the plastic seems to be holding it out leaving a 1/16 gap. I have checked and there is no build up or other obstruction other than the original poor design. Not going all the way back in means it may not seat pointed down causing water to stream in any direction the pull out happens to pointed. It is not family proof! I will be replacing it with something else, maybe not Kohler this time."
5,Great All-Purpose Faucet,"Oh Kohler, how I love thee.We purchased this faucet to replace a more traditional single-handle pullout faucet that broke. I was a bit doubtful about how simple this one looked, but it's performed amazingly. The toggle between the spray and normal modes is solid and moves from side to side - something I love. (Ever had to fight with those little silly buttons on top of a faucet?)Clean-up is easy - just swipe with a wet cloth with a bit of detergent on it.The faucet is tall enough to let us get even the biggest pots and pans out of the sink - and to fill the spaghetti pot while it's balancing on the sink ledge. It has almost a full 180-degree swivel and never feels wobbly."
4,"better than average, not 5 star... replace the aerator!","there were a handful of reviewers that complained that the water coming out splashes too much. they were correct. The problem is that the aerator doesn't do a good job. I would have rated this a 2 had it not been for Kohler's excellent CS. I called them up and complained and they shipped me a replacement aerator for free. the faucet works much better. I'm really picky so I would say that I've seen better... but it works.in all other regards the faucet is great. the lever has good movement. you can tell you have good hardware and not some $60 costco faucet. I know this because i did have one. the magnet that holds the faucet head is acceptable. i'm not sure what a 'good' one feels like but again, it's better than my cheapo costco one. the spray function could be more powerful IMO but it works well enough.remember that stainless steel doesn't look too hot when dirty. you can see the spots but it's not too bad."
4,Kohler Forte Kitchen Faucet,"Purchased this faucet a month ago and my husband installed it. Said it was easier to install than taking out the old one. I like the high clearance to get large pots and pails under faucet. Overall, very satisfied with this product."
2,"Looks good, works so-so","After five years usage now when switching from spray to stream, water continues to drip from the spray holes instead of being confined to a single stream. If you need to direct water into a smaller opening (tea pot, etc.), you are likely to spill. On top of that, one of the little buttons that toggle the spray head between spray and stream broke. After reading another reviewer with the same problem, I think I'll buy a new faucet from another manufacturer--I'm not interested in buying a replacement $90 spray head every time a poorly-designed plastic button breaks."
2,Lasted four months,"I have used many Kohler products and generally like them very much. However, I was skeptical of this particular faucet because it seemed rather lightweight and flimsy, compared to a similar spray-head faucet I bought several years ago, now discontinued. Still, it is good-looking, had the features I wanted, and bears the Kohler name. Four months after installing it, something inside the spray head has come loose and wedged the converter button so it no longer works - the thing is firmly stuck on stream and won't spray.Kohler was nice enough to give me a store credit over the phone, so I will use this to buy a Kohler sink. I wish they made a decent kitchen faucet, because now I need one to replace this. My recommendation: don't buy it."
1,Home Depot and Kohler bad combo for warranty,"Warranty is a problem when purchased through Home DepotOur faucet started to malfunction. But hey we thought, no problem, we have a life time warranty. Apparently not. Home Depot will not cover over 90 days. So you may not want to purchase your faucets there. Then we called Kohler customer service and they are only open M-F 8-5PM and that did not help us. It was so inconvenient to deal with Kohler, who does not replace faucets, they try to troubleshoot them on the phone and send parts. Meanwhile the water in your home is shut-off. In the end both Home Depot and Kohler made it so painful and difficult we purhased the competitor product. Having been bitten by the awkward warranty conditions with Home Depot and Kohler we double checked the warranty on the new faucet and its a no hastle replacement via the store we purchased it in. So what was the new faucet? A Delta faucet through Totem."
1,JUNK - Eventually won't turn,Failed after two years. The faucet was binding and would not turn at all. I do not recommend buying this because it is not worth the cost. It is cheap junk and should be priced as such.
3,Looks great...could perform better,"After a couple of years of use I began to find water underneath the sink. Turns out the sprayer hose was leaking, causing water to drip down the hose back under the sink. The replacement hose runs about $40 according to Kohler's website. However, a simple call to Kohler and 4 days later I had a new hose delivered for free. This faucet has a lifetime warranty and customer service from Kohler was amazing!"
4,Looks wonderful,"I purchased this faucet back in August 2011 at the exact price it is today for my kitchen remodel, which I thought was going to happen fairly soon. Well, the remodel was just completed, go figure. We took out the Corian kitchen countertop and replaced it with granite, and replaced the faucet, sink and disposal. This review so far is based solely on looks; the faucet is simply stunning and there are no leaks whatsoever. I am concerned about other reviewers' comments regarding leaks and other problems. Note, however, that our faucet was professionally installed. I will revisit this review at the six- and 12-month points to update for how the part is wearing and functioning."
5,A Godsend!,"I was recently diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes. This scale has made my life so much easier while trying to deal with this pregnancy complication. It works as advertised , I am so glad that we made this purchase."
4,"Convenient, accurate, short life","I used this scale to lose 120 lbs. by weighing everything I ate.Benefits: 1) You can weigh foods on any plate by putting it on the scale when you first turn it on, so it zero's out the weight of the plate. I did this all the time with my Corelle dishes, switching out an empty dish with an identical food laden one. You have to keep your finger on the scale while you switch plates.2)It is an accurate calorie counter.Problems: 1)The carb counter function does not give net carbs (after removing the fiber carbs). This is a serious problem I think.2) The scale died after 1 1/2 years. Just stopped as if the battery were dead, but changing the battery did not help.This machine was recommended by a weight loss doctor who measured the weights and found it to be accurate.I have to say I was pretty satisfied though if I had my druthers, I would like to have one that can input your own foods too, and I would also like it to give net carbs."
4,Works good!,Works very well! My first one malfunctioned and the manufacturer sent me a brand new one!
5,One of my favorite Edward Goreys,"I found this book in the art gallery. I loved it from the begining. Then we went out for Chinese food. So, in my mind, those two things are conected. D.Awdrey-Gore is based on Agatha Christie, who I'm also a big fan of, so this this book is twice as great."
4,"Easy to follow recipes, but no photos to see final cake/cookie","I really liked the recipes, easy to follow and the side comments are great. I wish there could be more pictures of the cake/cookie. The only images are those on the cover of the book, other than that the book is great."
5,maida heatters book of great chocolate desserts,"I really love this book. I think it is wonderful and any time I amhaving company, I choose a dessert from this book"
2,Boucheron Trouble,In the bottle this smelled like a lighter version of Hugo Red. A perfume I loved but could not wear as it was too cloying for me. Tried this one out while I was shopping and for the first 10 min I was in love. As the day wore on the fragrance began to remind me of my childhood. Memories of sitting on the floor playing with with Play Doh. The smell of that non-toxic clay stayed with me until I showered that night.
4,A GOOD KIND OF TROUBLE,"Since Boucheron's ""Initial"" and ""Jaipur are two of my favorite scents I was eager to try their latest - ""Trouble."" Catchy name, isn't it? And, it's apropos as the fragrance is fresh and a bit impish.Reflecting the name, the packaging is a square, faceted red bottle topped by an intricately designed gold cap.If one had to categorize this fragrance it would be Oriental. However, it is not as decidedly so as the ""Jaipur.""Highlighted by jasmine the scent is enriched by amber and vanilla. It's extremely appealing for both evening and day wear.This is one ""Trouble"" any gal would welcome."
1,the whole book is unreadable due to the worst print I have ever seen,"Throught out the whole book, I had to guess ""| |"" meant ""O"" or ""U"" or ""N"". I had to look around the context to figure out the word.This book should be classified ""reproduced antique"" so it is not misleading people to buy it as a spelling book.I wished someone had written this honest review so I did not bother to buy.The first reviewer mentioned nothing about this and gave high rating was purely an ad."
4,Great Book with some exceptional stories,"When I first read this book, i had checked it out of the library. I liked it so much i decided that I had to buy it. It has some great stories. Some aren't exactly what you might expect but that makes they even better. A must read for all comic readers and sci-fi fans."
2,Too many typos,"It may be the so-called Bible of atmospheric science, but there are too many typos for my taste. Perhaps if you're just trying to remember what the proper equation is, it'd work better.Tables of values are frequently missing minus signs here and there, which can make working out the problems and/or examples difficult. There are other random typos that make examples simply not work out. If you just want the equations, this is ok, but for learning, it's actually easier when the typos are in the equations (and not the numbers), since in that case there's a ""thought trail"" of sorts.The book claims to be the only reference, in which case you haven't got much choice, but that doesn't make it good."
3,Became a bit boring,"Written by a WH seamstress, this book was initially interesting but then kept telling the same few stories about life with the First familiest during the 1st half of the 20th century."
4,I may have to re-read this,"Much of this book is a sales pitch about the importance of making higher margins on sales. This I already knew and believed, and why I bought this book in the first place. After all of the good reviews, I will have to go back and re-read this, as I didn't get a clear answer as to how to compete in online business channels when competitors are slashing prices. My company has no issue with service, quality and delivery, returns, etc.. We ship next day, the highest quality products and answer customer service questions almost immediately. I wanted a book on HOW to make bigger profit margins not the importance of them. I will re-read this book again to see if there was something I missed..."
5,This book saved my life,"Writing_Solid_Code and Code_Complete (both from Microsoft Press) are required reading for professional programmers. After reading WSC I revamped both my personal coding style and my overall attitude about writing programs that are safe, reliable and robust. The chapter on assertions is worth it's weight in gold. If were to to hire a programmer today. I would want someone who had read this book and who was enthusiastic about it"
3,One of the books to read -- though not the only one,"You may not be impressed when you see that this is a Microsoft book. You may get bored at the beginning when all the examples are C and most about memory management. But it's worth persisting and reading onward, because sooner or later, some of the examples will look familiar. Simple concepts about what kind of coding leads to more defects, and what kinds are ""solid"" or robust."
4,Excellent read,Certainly no book can cover all the best practices to write best code but this book has done good attempt. Must read for all the fresh grads and developers before they start writing production code!
1,I thought it was a joke,"I saw the title for this book floating around in a humor list. It even had an ISBN number which I figured would lead me to a subtle second joke. Microsoft writing bug free code??? THAT is humorous. This book might be usefull in figuring out what NOT to do, assuming Microsoft actually uses this system. If I turned out one tenth as many bugs and was as late on as many projects as Microsoft I would not have a job."
1,Microsoft writes bug-free code?,Well sorry to say it folks but this is just another way to get our users; money.
2,"Heavy on Obfuscatory Text, Light on Content","In the Preface of ""Writing Solid Code,"" Maguire comments that he had never written a book before. Unfortunately, his lack of experience with writing a good technical manual is readily apparent. Much of the text revolves around examples of finding and correcting a bugs in the Macintosh Excel division of Microsoft. The text is awkardly written and his explanations are often obscure, especially to a beginning ""C"" programmer. It doesn't help matters that there is no difficulty rating assigned to this book; Writing Solid Code is definiately not written for the amateur, and beginners are unlikely to get much of value out of this text.I suppose my biggest gripe is that this book is very light on content in comparison to other computer books that are available. A much better book on software engineering is Steve McConnell's ""Code Complete,"" which costs only ten dollars more, and is available from Microsoft Press."
2,You'll learn a lot more on Usenet's comp.lang.c newsgroup.,"Maguire doubtlessly had the best of intentions when he authored this book. However, the book is filled with the Microsoft disease of Hungarian notation, obfuscating what might otherwise be acceptable examples. The book is also flawed by DOS-centricity...not surprising, considering the publisher. Also undermining the value of this work is Maguire's apparent desire to rewrite the Standard C language (see his getchar() wrapper). Get the FAQ-list from comp.lang.c. It's better, it's free and doesn't reek with the stench of Redmond"
5,An inspiration to all with her great wisdom and love,Daya Mata entered Paramahansa Yogananda's ashram in 1931 and is today his foremost living disciple. She inspires all with her great wisdom and love. She is president and spiritual head of the Self-Realization Fellowship. This remarkable book includes more than thirty chapters on her personal course for God-centered living. She convinces that we can know God and discover a hidden blessing in every adversity.
4,Very Fine Two-fer,"This is a very fine (and economical!) two-fer compendium of Romantic and early 20th century stylings featuring the sympathetic pairings of Tetzlaff & Andsnes on CD #1 and Tomter & Andsnes on CD #2. The breadth of expression, decidedly lyrical, is probably what impresses me the most here with dynamics ranging from an occasional fortissimo to the quietest pianissimo -- sublime! Ravel even gives us a little bit of blues. Noting the titles listed here on Amazon, know that these are all with either violin or viola and piano. The recordings with violist Tomter are close enough to hear his breathing, but I didn't find it too obtrusive."
2,Not the standard,I am a fan of Joan Hohl's work but this is way outside her normal release of work. It is completely different stylistically and the tone does not match that of any of her other works. The author does have a note stating that the stories were written early in her career and in the early 1980s but I do not believe that is the problem with the stories. Please be aware if you are a Joan Hohl reader these are very different from her other works.
5,Highly Recommended!,"When companies implement Customer Relationship Management (CRM), they often find that their number of complaints shoots up. Berndt Stauss and Wolfgang Seidel candidly explain that often, companies actively discourage complaints with processes that are so barrier-ridden that consumers switch to another company's products rather than negotiate the maze. As an alternative, Stauss and Seidel present a CRM-based complaint management system that, for enlightened corporate citizens, can become a strategic asset and even an indirect revenue source. Occasionally, they get a little carried away with their ""consultantese"" and terms like ""process owner"" and ""complaint owner."" Nevertheless, the seven-page complaint-management checklist at the end of the book is particularly valuable. We strongly recommend this book to CRM managers who want to know what their customers really think."
5,Tatum on the Chronological Classics: The Best!,"I am pleased to report that I have all six discs of Tatum available on the Chronological Classics (1932-1949); they are all absolutely superb: I wish everyone could have them. What the French have done on the CC series is maverlous: they've mastered the art of trans-recording from the old 78s to CD techne; this involves not only the elimination of surface noise, but the clarification of instrumental timbre and the correct pitch of revolutions per minute. The tracks are timed perfectly--not too fast as other producers pander. This first disc offers 20 of Tatum's exquisite early solos. I recommend this and the other five Tatum discs on the CC label."
1,"The newest from Ducasse, Inc.","I have dined in all of Alain Ducasse's Paris establishments{including the just opened Plaza Athenee location}as well as his Monte Carlo establishment and consider him a genius however, with the overblown pretension of the New York restaurant and now this book, one has to ask can even a genius spread himself too thin. The two real cookbooks by Ducasse are treasures, this book is not worth the price or the trouble. It is basically the Master's musings about his sources and philosophy of freshness and source....nice filler in a real cookbook but,not worth or worthy of a whole book. Save your money for a real Ducasse cookbook."
4,Charming and Drawing,"I was drawn to this deck, the art work is beautiful and The legend of King Aurthur is of great interest to me. It beats the Waite-Rider deck that I used to use."
5,"An intriguing, original, seminal history of travel routes","Catherine Gudis' Buyways is a unique and intrinsically fascinating history of the advertising billboard industry in America. Of immense value for the academic study of American business history, Buyways is also highly recommended reding for travelers and non-specialist general readers interested in wayside advertising and highway history. From legal battles between environmentalists and business interests, to the involvement of artists and behvioral scientists in billboard presentation and design, Buyways provides an intriguing, original, seminal history of travel routes and advertising format choices."
2,Elvis is the King but There's Room at the Inn for Remakes,"This is not really an Elvis tribute nor are these even the best remakes of songs that Elvis made famous - this is the sort of CD for completists and people who enjoy making mix Cd's with a odd track thrown in the mix. It's at best a whimsical collection and almost verging on novelty but to deny anybody (including William Shatner - surprisingly not in this collection :-) a chance to sing and presumably entertain us is wrong). Elvis sang plenty of remakes - and even though MY WAY is really Frank Sinatra's song, it's still appropriate for Elvis to give us another version. Just like we want to hear others try out versions of Elvis' best songs.They really should've called this a ""fun"" tribute to Elvis."
4,Kate C,Gaelic Storm is so much fun. They can cheer me up any day. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it came to me with a small scratch so that my player won't let me listen to the first 2 tracks.
3,Good but not Great,"I am a fan of Gaelic Storm. I enjoy this CD, but I do not think it is one of their best. Unless you are a big fan of Gaelic Storm, I suggest you buy another CD of theirs. But if you are a big fan or have all of their CDs, then buy this one as you will enjoy it."
4,Tons of energy!,"We saw Gaelic Storm in concert last weekend in Minneapolis and it was a great time-these ""lads"" have energy and charm to spare! Lots of fun songs on this album and the more traditional instrumentals are very well played."
5,Never disappointed,"I also never question buying a Gaelic Storm CD, and this one is definitely their best yet. Lots of beautiful melodies, awesome pipes, and hilarious lyrics. If you really like them...SEE THEM LIVE!! They're amazing and they love their fans."
5,Kiss Me I'm Irish(not really but I feel like it when I listen to this.),"I first heard of Gaelic Storm when I received a free tune from them already downloaded on a new mp3 player I purchased. I enjoyed the song so much I decided to look into purchasing the whole cd. Bring Yer Wellies By Gaelic Storm is one of the most fun cds I have listened to in a long time. It makes you want to kick up your heels and do an Irish jig,and to yell out to the world, ""Kiss Me I'm Irish!"", when your really not.All in all, I would say if your at all interested in gaelic, celtic, scottish, or Irish music, then Bring Yer Wellies by Gaelic Storm is a must buy for your music collection."
4,Bring yer wellies,This is a great album with some of the great songs that make their live show so awsome.
1,Disappointing CD,No where as good as first three CD's. A bit disappointing. Would not recommend . Irish Kiwi
1,Disappointing.......,"I loved Gaelic Storm's earlier albums MUCH more than this one. They seem to be moving further from fresh takes on traditional irish music, towards uninteresting, monotonous folk music with some fiddle and occasionally a pennywhistle in the background. Many of the songs are quite difficult to tell apart.All in all, this album was extremely disappointing. I would suggest that if you have not heard their music before, don't judge them by this. Instead try Herding Cats or Tree."
4,Invigorating and Fresh,"This is a wonderful collection of invigorating and fresh songs with a Celtic flair to them. A few are instrumental pieces but most are songs and they are all a joy to hear.The instrumental pieces are the more ""classical"" in the sense that they could have been done at an earlier time. The songs, though, have a youthfulness about them that screams ""modern"" but does so without losing the cultural heritage or style. Most are fun songs. All are great songs.This is an album to enjoy!"
5,"Modern, but keeps the traditional Irish spirit and fun","Most of us got our first introduction to the group when they played as the beneath the surface band on the movie ""Titanic."" Now, that was the party I would have wanted to attend! The buzz after the movie was--who is that group and where can I get more?I got more. Every single CD including this one. This is a fun and upbeat collection. If you haven't met the Storm yet, this is a good start. If you're an old fan, you'll want the CD."
4,Kenny Burrell,From the first note I can always identify Kenny Burrell. I have been playing guitar since 1965 and always delight in hearing anything from the great guitarists. When Lights Are Low includes some great Standards including Lil' Darling and the title cut.
4,Lavendar Floral Ladies Bag Review,"Timely received, easily tracked. Appreciated the fine embroidered pattern on the material. Very feminine. My wife liked it. I was surprised by the range of the retail price, which spanned from $47 to $75. It pays to shop around. Very satisfied with the product."
1,Filth,I was disgusted by this movie. It was a bloodfest that only got exposure because of the director. I felt so dirty after Watching the movie that I took a shower.
2,Ehhhh....,"An ""okay"" work of ""FICTION"". Interestingly enough, it portrays Mel Gibson's hatred for the Jews to the fullest!"
1,Half a good movie,I found the first half of the film to be very interesting and well done. Fine acting and production values. Then it turned into an S&M porno movie. The whippings with both the canes and the metal tipped whips caused me to fast forward through most of that scene. It was gratuitous and I could just see the S&M set buying this dvd just to pleasure themselves while watching it. The other thing that bothered me throughout was the fact that the score from Jesus Christ Superstar kept running through my head as I watched it. I would give the movie around 4-5 stars if the quality of the story telling had lived up the the first half for the entire film.
1,bloody,"This is a disgusting movie, nothing of the love the Bible teaches. It seems the writer of this movie was very angry to the point of hatred. Please don't take children. My advise is to not even see it at all."
1,S & M in lamb's clothing,"Mel Gibson's movies often involve torture, usually of Mel himself. It's pointless to speculate on the source of Gibson's self-loathing and contempt, but being raised as a fundamentalist, anti-Semitic catholic may have something to do with it. Mel's psychopathology is taken to its ultimate extreme in this lengthy, plotless, graphic depiction of torture. There is no plot, no spirituality, no message, just an innocent man being flayed. It is blatant Sadean voyeurism using a mask of religion to conceal the fact that its creator is sick, sick sick. It is revealing that this movie was so popular in a country that would elect another sick, ignorant fundamentalist for its President."
3,"I'm sorry Mel, 1-star for violence, 5-stars for good intentions","I don't speak ancient aramaic, and I'm probably being uncool to admit that I hate to read subtitles. But my problem with this film is the violence. I think it's way too much, and really bruises the viewers unneccessarily. I understand that part of the Christian experience is to understand the sacrifice and pain, but I felt like I was watching a Tobe Hooper Chainsaw massacre at times. For the violence, I give the film 1-star and WARN PARENTS before scarring their children. For Gibson's good intentions, I give the film 5-stars. It averages to 3 stars."
1,Pointless gorefest intended to please only the sadists out there.,"I watched this movie after it was pushed on me on by church members, I have never seen such a pointlessly violent movie. Jesus's life wasn't supposed to be about violence, why focus on it so much? I'm not trying to be picky or anything but (with some non-notable exceptions) EVERYTHING was simply someone getting beat up. What is the lesson? How is this supposed to be conducive to anything good?This movie says more to me about its sadisticly demented creators then anything to do with the life of Jesus."
1,Disappointing,"In a discussion I had with a friend about this movie, I complained that there didn't seem to be much to ground the suffering of Jesus in any kind of philosophy or lifestyle or teachings, something that would make the suffering be of interest. The suffering seemed kind of pointless to me, without the religious philosophy behind it. But the friend argued that the teachings of Jesus didn't matter at all, the only thing that mattered was the suffering Jesus endured while being crucified. Well, maybe that explains why Mel Gibson and American fundamentalists are lock-step on this story. It's a Passion Play without any passion, without any story and without any depth - it stays right at the surface, which is, I guess, where the director believes it belongs. This is literally a movie that is skin-deep - especially if you mean flayed skin, and HEEPS OF BLOOD. A bad movie not because it's shocking but because it's shallow and, despite the blood, it is terribly dull and terribly thin."
1,Count me out,"If the repulsive egotist and hypocrite Mel Gibson is a prime example of Christianity, I'm more proud than ever to be an atheist.I'd just like to point out to the zealots who are calling this a worldwide phenomenon - certain parts of the USA may have gone ga-ga over this film, but it was a FLOP in the UK, Ireland (surprisingly) and most of northern Europe."
1,Anti Semitism,"I don't understand. As a christian, this film made me quesy. All it is schlock and gore. Haven't we all seen John Waters films? This is just propaganda from the catholic church. Seriously, people need to get lives its a movie that entails everything in the bible with a few exceptions. Most people don't cry during church...unless ur a crazy pentecostal! (jk) But really its sad that we have films convert people to christianity that contain such hatreds of jews. I don't understand why he can't have a disclaimer at the beginning of the film. I guess what I want to do is apologize to jewish people everywhere on behalf of this film. not every christian is as intolerant as mel gibson"
1,Yuck!,"When I first saw this movie in the theater, I really thought it was horrible. But, I decided to give it a second chance on DVD...it was even WORSE! Here's the thing on this film, it's done based on the fact that we know who all of these characters are-NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT?? I'd expect a lack of character development in a porno, but not something that is supposed to be so ""moving"" and ""important"". So, yeah, I realize that most people know the story of Jesus and all that stuff...and I know the story, but this movie really didn't sell it for me. Oh, and let's talk about the ""gore"" in this film...oh please!!! The original Exorcist had better gore effects than this film! With such a huge budget, you would think they could afford something better. This movie sucked on so many levels, I can't believe I wasted four hours of my life on it! And, just like the kids from South Park, I think Mel Gibson owes me my money back!"
1,Sado-Jews and Masochist-Jesus,"The movie is a gore fest for violence loving Christians depicting their favorite Sadistic ""Christ killing"" Jews and anti-hero Jesus, who is supposed to be the Son of an omnipotent God and also that God himself, but is apparently so unimaginative that he can't think of another way to forgive his own creations by any other means than suicide. (Taking about running around the barn before going in.)If I were Jewish I would be really ticked off; good thing it's just the typical Christian propaganda and pure fiction.If you're a American sheeple or into blood and torture you'll love it."
1,THE PASSION OF THE CRAP,this movie is nothing more than two hours of the rodney king beatings except w/ jesus.
1,Uggh!,"I needed strong drink to wash my mouth out after sitting through POTC, the most distasteful film I've ever seen. The only benefit from watching it was the sense of duty to warn others off. Like incinerating an insect under a magnifying glass, Gibson accentuates a few verses in the story of the last week of Jesus into a gruesome, disgusting, gratuitous gorefest. Maybe it helps one's appreciation to believe that Jesus died for our sins (which I don't), but even in that case, I don't think that Gibson's relentless portrayal of violence adds much to the magic."
2,A Very Hard Movie to Watch,I went to see what all the hype was about. I came away with a mixed impression. It was hard to follow at times and very hard to watch the violence...but I can see how some might think it a great movie.
2,"wanted it to be good, but what a dissappointment...","This film leaves so much to be desired by the time the closing credits roll, you wonder why you sat through it in the first place. It appears to have absolutely no purpose... just meanders along violently... never giving... and there are few stories whether true or fictional that are better more exciting fare for good film-making than this -- so the plot was thick and ripe for an amazing movie experience... but they just didnt pull it off unfortunately. If you love the Jesus story you will be sadly dissappointed by this strange twisted desultory mess of a film."
1,What a boring snuff film,"Nothing more than an attempt to guilt trip people into believing a 2,000 year old fairy tale which is showing signs of decay. Remember, lot's of people were crucified and tortured in those times, what happened to this guy was no different. Also, its kind of ironic that Christians would deal out similar and even worse atrocities on non-believers in later centuries."
1,THE PASSION OF CHRIST,"IF YOU LIKE VIOLENCE SEE THIS MOVIE, BUT THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY IS THIS ""JIM"" THE ONE WHO PLAYED JESUS CHRIST DESERVES AN AWARD FOR THIS FILM, BUT OTHER THA THAT, TO ME IT WAS DISGUSTING AND DEGRATING............I KNOW THAT SUPPOSIVELY HAPPEN TO HIM, BUT IT WAS JUST NASTY.........93% OF THIS MOVIE WAS ALL VIOLENCE......."
2,Overrated!,"This movie is overrated indeed. Religious fanatics would disagree with me. I mostly feel asleep on this. Some of the storylines didn't make sense. For instance, I didn't get that one part where the one lady was acting like something out of the Exorcist. What was that all about?"
1,I'm a Christian. I didn't enjoy this Movie,"I thought the movie was long, bloody, and boring. Since I am a devout Christian, I didn't see this movie as anything but what it was, a MOVIE. It wasn't a religious experience. Just a bunch of actors being misdirected by Mel Gibson. I watched the movie for about an hour and walked out."
3,"Jesus goes through pain, then gets leg-hairs torn out.","GAH!--4 hours of Jesus dying?...If it's what the people want, this film delivers...Personally, I've never seen a bloodier film. Jesus is bull-whipped, beaten, and nailed to a cross...but if you know things, you should know that. All I could think about with Jesus covered in blood, wounds gaping, was ""I hope to GOD there's no lemon juice nearby."""
2,Who is the real Gibson?,"Who is the real Mel Gibson? A devout Catholic full of love, or an entertainer addicted to gore, blood, torture and violence, not only in this movie, but throughout his whole career?Well, it's up to you to decide. Unfortunately, he chose to display violence once more, this time centering his blood-lust around the Christ, to a point that, around the middle of the movie, some viewers were already num to the violence being shown on the screen, in such a way that whatever message this director was trying to pass was lost.It's a shame that such a budget by such a famous actor / director was wasted in telling one of the most important and beautiful stories of the world in this fashion..."
1,Jesus Christ.,"It should have been called the Blood of Christ, or Passion For The Almighty Dollar. Overly hyped, all violence and no plot. I can't wait for The Passion of The Christ Happy Meals. Relive your favorite moments from the film with ketsup packettes for the kiddies. Disgusting and numbing. Why are the religious fanatics so prone to the glorification violence? Save your money for ""Hell Boy."""
2,"It could, and would have been very powerful...","if it wasn't as long, tedious, or overly violent. Look at the Bible films that were done in the past. They weren't a bloodbath, yet kept you enthralled with good pacing and editing. Those films were perfectly adequate and conveyed the message of Jeseus.The Passion, however, hardly said anything of his life or teachings; they assumed that you knew all about him, and just focused on depicting his death. So if anyone wants to watch Christ get whipped senseless, scouged 100 times, and beaten to a bloody pulp, see this movie right away."
2,over the top,"I saw this movie twice: once in the theatre, rented it once.The movie is visually stunning, but lacks any real credibility. If you're looking for gratuitous Jesus love, then rent/buy it.If you have actually read the bible, this movie should offend you. It's blatant pandering to an unrealistic sense of events surrounding Jesus's crucification. Last Temptation of Christ was probably closer to truth."
5,You will convert VICE,This is a brilliant movie of the TRUTH.Its very moving and so TRUE.Vice i will continue to pose as you until you accepts JESUS.If you want me to create different accounts under your name i will.GOD IS TRUTH.
2,Mel Gibson's The Passion of Christ is relentlessly violent,"It took me till August of 2004 to watch The Passion Of Christ. I didn't think I could watch Christ so bruttaly tortuted. Then! I watched and just shook my head.I read this somewhere and could not have said it any better.""This movie expends so much energy portraying the wounds and innocent suffering of Jesus that the real climax of the Christian story -- the resurrection of Christ--all but evaporates from the screen. The movie drives so inexorably toward convincing us of the brutality of Jesus' death that nothing is left over when the resurrection comes. A deflated burial cloth, a new face, free from bloody bruises, a step out into the light.""The Only part of the movie that was even believable was parts of the actual Crucification. And what's up with the Devil being a woman?""Jesus Of Nazareth,"" gets my vote for the BEST movie on the BIRTH, LIFE, DEATH & RESSURECTION OF JESUS."
2,Pointlessly grotesque and one-dimensional.,"Despite Mel Gibson's claims of good intention, this film did nothing to help me understand nor believe the story of Jesus other than a over-dramatized work of fiction. But it did reinforce my belief that governments and religion simply do not mix, even to this day."
2,I'm sorry that I saw it and would NOT recommend it,"It is hard to fathom the idea that the story of the crucifixion could be made in a way in which the violence feels gratuitous, but Mel Gibson seems to have managed this difficult task. Instead of feeling inspired or touched or moved to compassion, I was left feeling numb. I was open to a more positive experience of the film, notwithstanding the inherent violence of the story.Whatever artistic or spiritual goals may have been intended by the writers and director, they were lost for me in the violence that appeared, as the film progressed, to be the the main objective."
1,What would Jesus do?,"If Jesus were alive today, he would boycott this proposterous assertion of his final moments. As any good, devout, patriotic christian knows from reading the sacred dead sea scrolls, Jesus lived to be an old man with many children and his beloved Queen Mary magdaline. Mel Gibson, or Mad Gibson, has clearly visited his cocaine dealer one too many times lately to dream up this convoluted, blood-bath of Caligula-styled paranoia in an extreme attempt to banish everyone elese's money into to his wallet. By the way, people who have been whipped this many times generally don't still have skin on their backs. A much more accurate portrayal of Jesus and God in the lives of people in modern times would be the powerfully moving The Order. With crisp direction and cardinal slurring, it is sure to keep the congregation gasping."
2,The truth about Jesus!,Jesus was nothing more than a petty criminal (at least according to Roman law at that time) who was rightly executed under Roman law. Jesus was a criminal and not the son of God!!
1,A travesty,"It is one thing for an individual with a true understanding of his subject matter to create an intelligent film. It is another matter when a wealthy Christian fundamentalist actor from action films chooses to do so and this is a film born of ignorance.The film is unnecessarily violent and bloody and is itself based on history remembered by those who were not witnesses.As a result, it is also strongly antisemitic at a time when the World does not need to fuel such hatred.I urge those who produced this travesty to read the American bestseller Constantine's Sword by James Carroll, who is himself a devout Catholic and if they have any intelligence - and of course, an open mind - they will be humbled by the experience and ashamed of the money they have wasted on this rubbish."
5,A Powerfull Film,This is a fantastic and passionate film the moves the audiencelike no other movie I have ever witnessed. It amazed me why so many film critics looked at this film more in a political light than in a religious or artistic light. It is a great great film.
5,Truly moving!,"I have never seen a movie which shows the true suffering of Christ before during and after the cruicifiction. Even though, it has subtitles they are unnecessary to understand what is being said."
5,The Greatest Movie Ever,"This is the greatest movie ever!!! I recommend everyone see it. I don't believe that people understand what Jesus did for us. He gave his life for us, who could never even come close to deserving it. The pain that he went through while people mocked him, spit on him, humiliated him and he didn't have to go through it, but he did because HE LOVES US!This movie gives as accurate portrayal of what Jesus did for us as you can get. James Cavaziel gave an amazing performace. I don't think anyone could have done any better.I believe that Mel Gibson was following GOD in this and I appreciate that someone will stand up for what he believes in and not be ashamed to say that he is a Christian and He loves GOD.As for me, I give it 5 stars, and recommend everyone to watch it. I believe that it will change your life. I am a Christian and had heard the story of Jesus all of my life, but seeing this movie really opened my eyes to what he went through for me, and everyone else."
5,Awesome,"My husband and I are devout Christians. When seeing this film in the theatre, we were both speechless. It was an amazing film and it was so accurate we could not believe it. This film not only brought us closer to God in our Christian walk but it also brought us closer together in actually experiencing this together. Mel Gibson did a fabulous job with this film and he should be praised highly for such an incredible and accurate interpretation of the Bible and of the Lord's devotion to us."
5,WOW,"This movie is very very cool. I for one will be honest and say I dont like to go to church, and im really not into anything spirtual, but I HAD to see this movie. This movie is one of the few movies that I was about ready to cry watching it. Mel Gibson did a very fine job showing what Jesus did for his people. This movie actuly scared me in some scenes which added to its value. This is one of the few films also that when I got up to leave the theater, I look around and half the audience is still sitting in there seats, looking blankly at the screen. Props to James Caviezel for his outstanding portral as Jesus. He did an unbeleavable job for that kind of demanding role. Well worth the price of admition and dvd."
5,oi,"haha a horror movie? hmm perhaps.the funny thing is, according to your bible, that's HOW IT HAPPEND.the fact is, no one should be getting offended by this movie. wah wah it's too violent. fine, then don't watch. just because it's about jesus doesn't mean you hafta pay for a ticket. the advertising for this movie is insane, so don't tell me you didn't KNOW it was going to be violent. and if you wanted a non-violent movie, maybe you should go watch a comedy. not a movie about jesus being HUNG ON A CROSS, STABBED, AND BEATEN. guess what? according to that book you believe, THAT'S WHAT HAPPEND TO HIM. did you want Mel Gibson to put up a fake portrayal of what happend????oh, yeah. and the movie was really good. i don't even believe this stuff, but it was very emotional, and worth seeing."
3,View from a Messianic Jew,"As a Messianic Jew, I saw both positive and negative aspects to this film. Jesus' refusal to pick up the sword, and His decision to pick up His cross and endure all suffering until He fulfilled His Messianic mission of Golgotha was deeply moving and inspiring. However, this movie reinforces the myth that most Jews hated Jesus and wanted to crucify Him. In reality, Jesus was very popular with most Jews of His day, which caused the political and religious leaders to seek His death out of fear and envy. And today, most Jewish people highly regard Jesus as a good and wise man, perhaps even a prophet. And a growing number of us believe that He is the promised Messiah of Israel."
5,very touching,very touching movie. definetly recommend anyone to go see it. Mel Gibson took care of every little detail. loved the symbolism. very innovative and not at all monotonous.
3,Too much?,"I will start off by saying that I've seen many a violent action film and this is definitely one of the top 3 most violent that I've ever seen. The whipping scene alone is perhaps the most violent scene ever filmed. The effects were realistic in this and it is gruesome. I will also state that I'm a Secular Humanist and while I believe the ""man"" Jesus Christ existed, I'm not convinced he did all the things the Bible says he did. While I feel that Gibson was trying to give as accurate an adaptation as possible, I felt some of it was a bit hard to follow and in some parts it was about the movie making experience. Some of it was over-the-top scenes of implausibility, and greatly unrealistic. I am glad that I watched it, but don't care to see it again."
3,Forgive My Honesty,"I don't see Christ but brutal violence. This seems a documentary film to me. Basically the film zooms into the final 12 hours in the life of Jesus. I only see a man got tortured & tortured again then crucified in bloody violent ways, finally died. Yes, you will see how Jesus suffered and died, vividly to your eyes. Period. The whole movie script is spoken in Aramaic and Latin with English subtitle; however, quite alot of scenes seem missing subtitle. Do not expect any delete scenes, extra features, casting, or director's commentary. Nothing. Period.Be honest, say if the man in the film is not Jesus, would you rate it the same? If not, because he's not Jesus? Hmm......*** Otto Yuen's DVD Special Rating for The Passion of the Christ ***1. Film Rewatchability: LOW2. DVD Featurability: VERY WEAK3. Picture Quality: EXCELLENT4. Sound Quality: EXCELLENT(Reviewed by Otto Yuen, 1-Oct-2004)"
5,5 Stars For a Great Movie!!!!,"This is one of the most remarkable, well-made, and inspiring films made in recent years. It has touched millions of lives, influenced many people to return to church, and has given many a new found respect on religion. It is a film that everyone should see and needs to see. The DVD will be out on August 31st so go get it."
4,The Passion of the Christ,I think Mel Gibson accomplished something very important with this film. James Caviezel was deeply moving in his portrayal of the Christ. The other actors made their characters believable. Although no movie could ever do justice to this subject matter; this one is an admirable attempt at illustrating how terribly He suffered for us. The ending shows a unique glimpse of His Resurrection (and ultimate triumph).
5,The Last Twelve Hours,"The Most conteversal film of the year is also one of the best. a brilliant but tragic film. I Still liked Braveheart better ,but this is a triumph for Mel Gibson. I saw this movie in theaters and this is the first movie I've seen in another language and english subtitles. This film is one of highest grossing movies of the year. I recommend this movie, you might think it will be boring, so did I ,but once I saw it really wasn't boring. If your into gripping epics, then this is a great one. If your only into happy feel good movies then of course ignore this one. If you liked Braveheart I say see this too. experience the Grace, the Power, the Passion of this gripping epic starring Jim Caviezel."
4,A powerful revelation,"I saw this movie and I was blown away. While I can understand the controversy, I never fully understood just what Jesus did for us until I saw this film. This was truly a great man. As a bible belt resident who spent 18 years in Sunday School, I already knew about Jesus dying for our sins so that we may enjoy eternal life, so I was not too impressed with this part of the story, no, what amaazed me was that Jesus was the inventor of the modern table. I have read the new testament and never knew that Jesus first had the idea for the modern table. I have two bad knees, so this really raised my opinion of Jesus. Eternal salvation is great, but not having to kneel down when i eat, wow, now that's something to worship a man over. Also I would like to thank the good people at AMC Theatres for reminding me that nothing goes better with incredibly graphic images of our Lord being crucified than popcorn, Diet Coke, and some penut butter M&Ms."
5,A must see,"just saw the Passion, and first let me say that I have never bothered to review a movie on a forum like this before. Having said that, this movie was extrordinary. It was graphic, at times brutal, but remember the point of this movie, the crucifiction of Christ...enough said. As for the much overplayed charge of anti-semitism, only those who go to the movie looking for such, will see it in the film, and those same individuals will have missed the entire message of the movie. The Jews didn't kill Jesus, we ALL did, because of our sins. If you chose to miss this movie not only will you have missed a great flick, but a potentially a life altering message."
3,The Passion of the Christ,The movie is excellent but when I tried entering ENGLISH for the language it would not do it. Very disappointing that you have the options to choose the language but would not do it.
2,Why?,"It's not a very subtle film is it? It's not a complete disaster and technically it's flawless as could be expected but why would one want to watch torture for the duration of a feature length film? Is the film aimed at the type of person who has, through the centuries showed up cheering at public executions and beatings? Propably, and there is a lot of them isn't there?"
5,The most edifying movie ever made,"This movie will haunt you for a long, long time - possibly for the rest of your life. While there is so much talk regarding the brutality depicted in the movie, people need to realize that the brutality is factual, and that this is what Christ endured for us. I don't see the anti-Semitic bent seen by others in the movie. I think Mel Gibson was even handed in showing that all of mankind was responsible for the death of Christ, be he Roman, Jew or Christian. The movie is captioned due to the fact that it is spoken in the language of the time, Aramaic. However, you are not even aware of reading while you are watching the movie. The acting is incredible, the special effects daunting, and all in all, the movie is life changing. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is in search of spiritual awakening or redemption. It is not to be missed."
4,What I learned from The Passion of the Christ,"Although I was knowledgeable about the crucifixion of Jesus, the impact of this movie was huge. Why? Well, knowing is one thing, understanding is another. Because of the graphic depiction of the insults, beatings and suffering by Jesus during the Passion, came understanding. Understanding more of the price that He freely paid in order to redeem all though who will acccept the FREE gift of life.My prayer is that this movie will be re-released so multitudes more will understand the price of this FREE Gift . . . ."
5,Just Made my soul better...,What can i say about The Passion of the Christ?No words... Just feelings...
2,Scary and uninspiring,"Why do a movie like this? What purpose does it serve? I only took away the shock and a stomach ache. Nearly every writer here rejects the violence in this movie but then they feel compelled to give the movie good grades. Its just a movie for ""Godsake"". You are not giving grades to ""God"".The dipictions distracted from any message that Director hoped to get across. Isn't Godlyness about love and forgiveness? What purpose does it serve 2000 years later to fake up the violence in this manner. Is this really the message of Christianity? That we love to watch our Gods brutalized in this manner and consider it a holy experience. Is this Christianity's core?May be it is for certain people such as Mel Gibson and his clan, but I reject this portryal of Christianity. The whole violence thing was a crass trick to get people to see this movie. I went home and watched ""Jesus Christ SuperStar"" just to get rid of the awful taste in my mouth."
1,"Lordy, what a movie!","This movie is not based upon the Bible. It comes from a book written by a looney nun (Anne Catherine Emmerich) published in 1833: ""The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ.""Better to spend your money on ""The Passion of the Jew,"" a South Park episode which proves that Mel Gibson is crazy."
1,"a sick, pointless exercise in sadomasochism","I can't understand how people can see this as a recruiting film for churches. Frankly, I worry about people who liked this having custody of children or pets. If anything, it made me want to avoid churchgoers as I avoid Nazis and Klansmen. If I were a Martian arriving on earth and this was shown to me to explain this major religion, I would recommend having the earth vaporized before this dangerous insanity spread. Jesus said some admirable things about mercy and forgiveness, but you won't find them in this sick piece of trash."
2,Lost respect for Mel Gibson,"This is a film that I cannot even recommend to my elderly, born-again Christian grandparents. I have lost respect for Mel Gibson after being subjected to the abusive violence in this slasher film. But I suppose this is the product of a kooky director with too much time on his hands.I will give this movie 2 stars only becuase the cinematography is beautiful, the acting superb and the setting/costumes were perfect.The content of the film is horrible. Stick with the Biblical version and you can't go wrong.Oh & Jim Cavaziel is hot."
1,Not worth anyone's time,"I am a big fan of Monica Belucci but that didn't get me to see this film till a year later after it came out. It is a silly movie. Nothing realistic about it. Pasolini's The Gospel According to Matthew (1964) is a far superior film. I think you have a hard time trying to make a popular entertainment and trying to tell the truth simultaneously, because people will prefer fantasy and cliche over truth and beauty. It's telling that most people who bought this DVD also bought the Star Wars DVD. Star Wars must be one of the biggest myths of our time."
1,Only the mislead believe this RUBBISH!!!,"Well since the sheep are lazy,they carn`t seem to understand jesus is a con and if you read the bible deeply YOU will understand why!This movie is only for the desperate losers in this world!"
2,CHRIST.,"I know the back ground of Jesus and my dispute with this movie is that it should have explained more about the story of Jesus. I mean not many people (religious or not) know most of the stories about Jesus. They should have explained what Jesus believed in more and also the back ground stories of the people shown in the film. I mean it should have had much more about the life of Jesus, instead my friends were asking me to explain who the characters were. He would have reached more people if he has done this. Also SO many other people though history have suffered because of Christianity. About 60,000 women were tortured to death in the ""witch trials"", for no reason! This movie has no perspective, its just over an hour of gore! The only good that can come out of this movie is if Mel spends some of his hundreds of millions on worth while causes."
2,Unfortunate film reflects the film maker's values,"Perhaps it takes drunkenness to get Mel Gibson to admit the obvious: that they does not like Jews. Sadly, this film not only insults them, but Christians as well, with its brutal violence and its cartoon-like recreation of the greatest and most dramatic moments of Christ's time on earth. To make it worst, the bad guys in the movie sound as if they are speaking Klingon. Stick to goofy police & buddy films, as well as dopey love stories, Mel, as that is where your talents are to be found."
5,"Powerful, compelling, masterfully done","I do not claim to be an expert on religion. I have heard all of the controversial comments that this movie did not coincide with the actual happenings and the Jews were misrepresented. All I know is that was a great movie by Mel Gibson. There was not one dry eye in the theatre when it was over and I have been hearing all sorts of good things onhow this movie compelled people to get closer to the church after it was released, here in America and in other parts of the world.And YES--I will buy the dvd. It is rare that a movie of this quality comes out."
2,THE SNUFF FILM AS HIGH ART,"Beautifully acted and filmed (by the son of noted Holocaust denier Hutton Gibson), obviously made with ""passion"" for the (literal and figurative) self-flagellation crowd. After the poor guy gets the lash for the 114th time (yeah, I know it's only 39; it just seemed like 114), with all that red-dyed corn syrup splattering all over the place, it just starts to get a little silly, kind of like the flying entrails in ANDY WARHOL'S FRANKENSTEIN. Capital punishment is, of course, not very funny, especially when the punishment is Death By Torture, so I did my best not to laugh.If Evangelicals, Opus Dei Catholics, sadists and other moonbats want to go all swooney over this sort of thing, they are most welcome to. To the curious, but more sqeamish, of my fellow nonbelievers, I would not suggest watching this after a heavy meal. If you must do so, keep a bucket handy."
5,the greatest movie about the most important story every told,"title says it all. if you aren't sure whether or not to buy it, read the story, it should convince you it's worth seeing more of. you can find the story for free at most churches or on the internet, it's called the Bible."
1,I Read My Bible-------,"Blood! Gore! Violence! Mel Gibson obviously has his hand all over this movie, fer sure. But what about the subject matter? Gee. When I want to know what the truth is about the last moments of my lord Jesus Christ, I'll read the Bible. Hollywood doesn't do it for me and I won't put gold coin in their pockets."
2,We get the point,"It doesn't take an hour and 1/2 of a movie of beating one person to get the point. I understand Jesus was whipped, beat, etc etc etc. But to sit for an hour and 1/2 of the movie to watch it, well is overkill.. Cut out an hour of the torture and the movie might now be so painfull(pun intended)."
2,"Unnecessarily violent, and was missing the whole point, that is LOVE","This movie is more like a propaganda film. None of us will ever know for sure about the historical Jesus, since he lives more in myths and beliefs than in historical chronicle. How did Mr Gibson know about the level of cruelty shown? Moreover, Jesus was depicted more like the conventional iconography--caucasian male with a beard and long hair. How did a hard working carpenter look in 2000 yrs old Middle East? Certainly not like the one shown.However, this movie did one good thing for me: reminded me about the necessity to cultivate compassion for fellow human beings. On the other hand, for the simple-minded, literal believer, this movie will generate hate, vengeance, and totally undeserving surge of emotion.From that standpoint, I must say, this movie fell short as a visual art.Watch it, but please ""watch out"" about what you feel."
1,another one,"with so many movies, books, and shows about ""the greatest story ever told"" do we really need another one? I suppose because this one sets a record for the biggest-budgeted ""story""?There's too much violence, and the real villain Pontius Pilate is depicted as a sympathetic caring individual which is historically inaccurate. There was no way the Roman procurator would be told what to do by anyone, particularly by Jewish people, oppressed and brutalized by the Romans. In addition, this flick is completely devoid of real spirituality, but Hollywood sham abounds with ridiculous satan, slow-motion shots, and lots of blood. Then again, what can you expect from an B-movie shoot-em-up ""star"" who suddenly found his ""true calling""?What's particularly appaling is the participation of a daugher of a Holocaust survivor in this film, given Gibson-pere's statement that the Holocaust never happened.This movie will appeal to right-wing Christian zealots and Nazis."
1,Just plain boring,"It bored me so much that I couldn't even watch the whole thing, and I can handle some pretty boring stuff. Not much more to say about it."
1,The Passion of the Christ,A waste of money as they is nothing other then violence and misinformation.
1,"Didn't see it, don't need to","Virulently anti-Semitic, maniacally violent. I borrow from another customer reviewer these words: ""As a civilized person, I am repulsed by this horror."" DO YOU THINK THAT IT IS A COINCIDENCE THAT A MAN WHOSE FATHER IS A HOLOCAUST DENIER JUST HAPPENED TO BE THE ONE TO MAKE THIS MOVIE???????!!!!!!P.S. Taking your kids to this is tantamount to child abuse."
5,"Great movie, arrived Brand new and safe & sound!","This is a movie I had always intentioned to have in my movie collection and never got around to it. So when I seen it on Amazon, I thought wow great! now I can finally buy it at a very low price. So I did. I am very satisfied with my purchase as it arrived in brand new condition in original packaging. The shipping envelope it came in was very protective as my shipment arrived in pristine condition. Amazon and this seller won a forever customer for this transaction."
3,Unrealistic,"I am a Christian and a Catholic but my faith is not solely based on passion and sufferings. Sure. I know very well that Christ died for me in such unmeasurable pain. But do I really need to see it in a gory kind of way? What's unrealistic is the way the punishment was portrayed- too harsh for a human to endure, I mean physically. We must remember that Christ was 100 % human during that time and subject to physical limitations of a human being. The sufferings were simply portrayed as too unbelievable. Any human subject to that kind of punishment will die sooner from loss of blood, broken bones, and other internal organ damages. Didn't you see how Mary the mother's towel get soaked in so much blood? it looked like you can squeeze it and get a gallon of blood. Simply put, the movie is overly exaggerated. Some members of the Catholic Church said that it was the closest thing to the truth. What truth? What's the basis? If it cannot be 100% true, then it is still a lie- a Hollywood flick."
5,Breathtaking,"To say that this movie is a cinematic masterpiece is a gross understatement and quite simply fails to do it justice. Watching this movie is like walking into the Louvre and viewing an amazing piece of art. Every moment completely encapsulates you and stays with you, every pan of the camera, every heartbreaking injustice opens your eyes to what true strength is. Mr. Gibson created a breathtakingly beautiful film, we are lucky enough to watch a moving piece of art unfold in front of our sometimes shocked, but always believing eyes. His casting was incredible, Jim Caviezel was absolutely stunning as Jesus and Maia Morgenstern's performance as the Virgin Mary was utterly tragic.As for the controversies that surrounded this film, you quite simply have to put all controversies aside the moment the film begins. Once you step foot into Mr. Gibson's profound experience of Jesus' Passion you can't help but feel changed."
5,A classic,"So, so, well done. The language, the cinematography, the music, the costuming, the acting, the visual effects... you are there.And Gethsemane and Calvary during the Passion were at once terrible and beautiful places to be.If you are a Christian, you owe it to yourself to experience this film. If you are not, you should see it anyway because filmmaking like this doesn't come along very often."
5,"Oh My God, What a Movie!!!!!","When I orginally saw this movie Ash Wednesday of this year, I was like I know what is going on, it won't be that bad. Boy, I was ever wrong. I have seen other depictions of Jesus Christ, but this has to be one of the best. I feel a closer my Jesus christ for his sacrifice. There is no other person that comes before my jesus and his mother mary. I know this has been repeated many times, but it is the truth, I feel the violence was necessary to show the anormity of our lord's sacrifice. This is a must have for the person who has that special relationship with jesus, like I do.5 thumbs way up high!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,PRETTY GOOD!,"PRETTY GOOD,BUT IT ISN`T VERY APPROPREATE FOR CHILDREN TO WATCH.A GREAT FILM THAT TELLS THE STORY OF JESUS!"
5,The passion of the Christ on blu ray,"I have remarked to my father several times that this movie should be on Blu-ray. I am elated that this film is finally in high definition. This movie is one of the most technically stunning films I have ever seen. The passion is perfect for Blu-ray, this is a must own for people who like Blu-ray, Christians, and film buffs."
4,"A masterpiece, of course, with only one problem...","The film, of course, is a masterpiece. I loved every minute of it. My problem, however, is with the special features on the DVD. I know that special features have become somewhat obligatory, but are bloopers really appropriate? It seems somehow sacrilegious to show an actor getting hit below the belt in the most sacred movie ever made. I'm as big a fan of guys getting hit in the jewels as the next guy, but save if for ""Ernie Goes to Golgatha."""
2,Missed The Point!!!,"After watching this movie I think Mel Gibson missed the point of Christ dying. His movie seemed to focus more on the beating and torture of Christ than the result of his death. It is important to understand that Christ died because of all of us. The Jews, Christians, Atheists, Agnostics, and everyone alike. It makes no difference who physically killed Christ the symbolism is that he dies for all of our sins. Most great people have focused on the return of Christ from the dead, this is the imporatant point. His return and the salvation of mankind. I think Gibson believes that we should all be reminded how brutal Christ's death was, but this is disrespectful to his image and completely disregards what this event meant for mankind. As for the film being anti-semetic, I think it is, but only for those who ignore the fact that Chrsit died because of our sins and we all sin. All of us are responisible and people should keep that in mind, at least all who believe in the Christian faith."
2,"If Jesus Christ had died in prison, would we be saved?","Read Chuck Palahniuk's ""Survior"" instead, a much more interesting religious story..favorite quotes that relate to The Passion Of Christ are:""If Jesus Christ had died in prison, with no one watching and with no one there to mourn or torture him, would we be saved?"".....""The biggest factor that makes you a saint is the amount of press coverage you get."".....""The key to salvation is how much attention you get. How high a profile you get. Your audience share. Your exposure. Your name recognition. Your press following. The buzz.""From pages 152 and 151 of ""Survivor"""
1,horrific just horrific,"this was a 2 hour snuff film and im sad i saw it. the movie didnt have a single thread of of moral value,and nothing about what mad jesus great. all it shows is that jesus could take a beating and anyone who walks away from this thinking they are a better person for it is sick.to many people over look the fact that its so incredibly violent just because they say its historicaly acurate. well so what that would be like making a movie about joan of arc that is 2 hours of her smoldering on the stake and not about her passion(please mel if you read this dont make a movie out of it). all in all dont waste your time with this movie unless you are looking for a gore flick."
1,Talk about overrated,"Look I respect Mel Gibson and I think he's a great actor and has done some great films but this movie was just totally pointless and I frankly don't see the appeal. I don't at all think it's anti-semetic or too violent but to me it was just pointless and boring. I can't see how anyone would find this to be moving or inspiring. For one thing, all they focused on was the beating and crucifiction. They never focused on Jesus's life or his teachings, or accomplishments. I consider myself to be a Christian moderate and I don't believe in everything the church preaches but with all the hype around this film, I expected more. I frankly want to know what moved or inspired anyone here because this was nothing more but a two hour snuff film disguised as something with a spiritual message. I understand the point of showing the gory details to try to convince people to change thier lives but the fact that it's fake really takes away from the effect."
1,The Worst Movie Of All Time!,"I wish I could have rated this movie with no stars.It is like the Columbine Massacre for Christians.It should be banned.Jesus, the Christ, is much more deserving of holy respect than what he receives from the hack job of this violent video game produced by Mel Gibson.If you want scarey blood and gore, buy the Exorcist."
1,Who was Jebus?,I'm not sure who this Jebus fellow was but I guess he was a pretty important person to have a film made about his life. When does part II come out?
2,The greatest piece of FICTION ever created!!!!,Who could think of such great and creative fiction? Mel Gibson is a truly smart individual for coming up with (probably with the help of a large dosage of drugs) such an incredible piece of fantasy! Mr. Gibson's mind must be so out of touch with reality that he actually thought of creating such mythology (after all Jesus never even existed) and putting it out there for the moronic public to eat up like candy.Customers who enjoyed and believed this piece of fantasy would also like the following fictional movies:The Adventures of Pluto NashBattlefield EarthMad MaxGattaca
1,Whose Passion?,"Master,Things are going very smoothly. Undoubtedly,Emmerich's pervasive presence has allowed meto persevere on the set; it's the same spiritualforce I believe that will catapult this film to thetop of the box office. In my ponderings, I can'thelp but wonder if these same forces are what aidedher in her levitating and astral projecting. Itake devilsh delight in believing so.If you would kindly send me another copy of ""TheDolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ"" I wouldbe indebted to you. Unfortunately, my copy wascovered in blood. It seems to be everywhere, I justcan't help myself sometimes. And I can't help butfeel wholly nostalgic as I'm transported back tothe blood-drenched fields of Scotland and SC.The Director"
1,I want 2 hours of my life back...,"This movie sucks... for more than one reason: It's historically and biblically incorrect. It's boring. It's so violant that J. looks like raw hamburger meat come the middle of the movie. And now and then it's even funny... but just because it is so bad.You want to see the passion of christ? Watch any other movie, except this one. Or even better... read the bible."
1,Slop. Horrible. Trash. Garbage.,"By far the worst movie I've ever seen. It has nothing going for it except that it made tons of money. Good for Mel. Do I think it was anti-semetic? No. I'm Jewish, but I wasn't offended. You can only be offended by something or someone you respect as an authority or someone who you perceive is better than you. But I will tell you this: Christians believe Christ died for our sins. After seeing this movie I can tell you that if Christ did die for our sins he wasn't a volunteer. They had to drag his [...] up that hill--kicking and screaming."
2,The Passion,"Wow, this movie is the best since Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory. Except Willy Wonka was probably a little better. If you have read this, a voo doo curse has been put on you and your soul now belongs to me. I can't stand christians. Burn, all of you."
2,hmmmm,"If this is supposed to be an accurate portrayal of Jesus, wouldn't he be of middle-eastern descent?"
1,Not Accurate at all,"This movie is not accurate at all. If you really want to study and know the truth about the passion of the Christ may I suggest that you take a few courses in Christology at your local theology schools. Please don't be fooled by this mockery of a film. If you really want to know about the teachings of Christ and to emulate him, then I might suggest that you study his philosophies along with the readings of the Buddha, and many, many other philosophers and spiritual teachers. This movie is total Hollywood bogus"
1,A Waste of Time,Historically inaccurate and boring. It only depicts graphic scenes of Christ's crucification and nothing else. It lacks depth and pretty much everything else. Don't waste your time or money buying this.
1,Done already...and better,"I knew the story already, and I have seen probably all the classic ""passion"" movies. The only thing different is more graphic(really graphic)violence.I know Jesus suffered horribly. What is the point? I don't need to see him whipped to a bloody pulp with grisly implements.With Mel Gibson's heavy handed direction, it was like watching a senseless slasher movie. After a while you just go numb.This film is nothing new.The story has been told before, and with much more finesse."
4,Truth or Dare!,The TRUTH is that Christianity offers a solution to those who have problems in life. Christianity is not the same as catholicism or related with the bad things done for over the centuries by the catholic church - like the evangelisation and slavery to the native people of different continents such as Africa and America's and the Holy Inquisition!It IS Universal! The Laws of Christ are the laws that we - who live in a democratic and free country - still use! If Jesus have died to save the problems of mankind we should be must be thankfull in the year of the Lord 2005! Still His Birthday for us to remember! Always!The meaning of this Mel Gibson's masterpiece is based on the universal message of Christ!
1,Isnt this blasphemy???,What's up with the Jesus visuals??? Were not suppose to make any image of God. Why do non-Christians understand this and most Evangelicals dont????
1,not playable,"item will not play...there is no indication on the dvd that it is not playable in my region, however, it will not play...nor was there any indication online when I purchased the item that it was not playable in my region."
5,IT IS AS IT WAS,"Mel Gibson's depiction of THE PASSION is probably as close to reality as it is ever possible to get.The savagery of the Roman soldiers corresponds to other historical accounts, and the insidiousness of the Jewish Religious Leaders of the time, closely follows Scriptural accounts."
1,"Disturbing, Very Disturbing","Three hours of a man being beaten, and whiped, and god knows what else. No character development, no message, just brutality. Only a sadist would go to this film."
1,Yuck,"Love Mel Gibson. But this movie was so dark I wanted to shake the screen. I know it was a dark day but good godness help me, I disliked this movie. I guess it's one of those movies, either you love it or hate it. I'm in the later. I keep thinking of something good to say about this, but I just cannot. So if you are questioning if this movie is worth the time to see it, it probably is not."
5,Jesus,"Nonfiction. Account of the arrest, scourging, and cruficixion of Jesus of Nazareth.Majesty: 10/10Execution: 9/10Taint: 0/10Total: 29Best feature: Critics accuse movie that proclaims God to be an ethnic Jew of ""anti-Semitism.""""Majesty"" measures how much glory, beauty, and truth the film attains, meaning serious films do better.

""Taint"" measures degree of corruption by liberal ideology.Total score = 2 * Majesty + Execution - .5 * Taint^2, rounded up.For o[...]"
1,Buy the book and Stationary Kit TOO!!,"After all, this IS a product and it has all the tie-ins to boot. The ""Passion"" Stationary Kit is now available at Walmart. And you thought you were viewing a religious experience? Come on now!! Mel Gibson got so angry at a critic he threatened to hurt him. Oh and the actor who plays Jesus also played a psychotic killer. Back to earth folks. It's a Mel Gibson production."
1,Quintessential bad film making,"Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"", is the epitome of pretentious filmmaking. From the start the film screams pretentious, with the use of a [...] and the overly artistic cinematography. After the thirty or so minutes of mellodrama, Mel jumps straight to the gore. Now I'm not about to [...] about the films' content, because frankly I was not at all disturbed. But I did find it to be extremly dull and after the fifth-teenth time Jesus fell down under the weight of the cross, I began getting [...] off. Hell, I'm sure the film would have been half the lenght had Gibson not opted to present every seen of bloodshed in super-slow-motion. Mel Gibson cannot direct, we have seen so with ""braveheart"", he is merely capable of producing mawkish [...] like this."
1,Made me queasy...,"Man, this was one bloody movie...don't see this on a full stomach, and don't take your children to see this. My kid won't sleep for a week."
5,Cinematic Genius and True to The Scriptures,"This movie is a true and faithful telling about the last hours of Our Savior. Finally, a movie that is not a watered down version of how Jesus Christ suffered and died for us. Not for the fainthearted, because as graphic as this movie is, this is as close as we will get to being there to witness the actual crucifixion of Christ. Mel Gibson is to be commended for having courage to pursue and complete such a beautiful and brilliant masterpiece, and obviously a work of love and faith."
2,Overrated Fairy Tale,"While the film was shot beautifully and the acting was fantastic, it did not help to overcome the hollow feeling this film left. Yes the violence was extreme, but in this regard it did more to hinder the emotion that was trying to be conveyed. There comes a point when it is TOO much. We, the audience, become desensitized and detached from what the filmmaker is trying to get across. In other words, the point is gotten across so much that we feel hit over the head with it. Whether you believe this stuff really happened or not (personally I do not), speaking from a film-only critique, it did more damage than good. And does anyone else find it a bit sad how they sell nails from the movie as necklace charms? Ugh! I'm sure if there is a Jesus, he wouldn't be so happy at a blatant grab for cash as opposed to helping a fellow man in need."
2,"If a two hour Jesus lynching is what you want, here you have it.","The Passion of The Christ, dealing with the last days of Jesus's life, is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus, laughing at his pain, mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent, but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable, and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
3,Too Violent,"Christ's compassion is there in a certain sense, but the love, and not the violence should be glorified here.Which term would Christ approve of more? The glory of love or the glory of violence. I think it would be the former.Gibson should have concentrated on what Christ did to teach love in many different examples, not to let the violence go on and on and on and on and on.Three stars for effort...that's it.I still think Mel is a brilliant actor."
1,Snuff film with the same accuracy as Cinderella & Star Wars,"This movie makes it's emotional appeal through utterly disgusting violence that attempts (unfortunately for many, successfully attempts) to instill faith in the fairytale of some guy who claimed to be God's son. The truth is, we don't know the exact details of the man Jesus of Nazareth's execution- which by the way was one of many executions that took place during this time period. But scientifically speaking, we definitely know that the majority of the violence portrayed in this film does more to sell tickets than to actually show possible torture (a person would have went into shock or died from blood loss after the first few blows).This movie does nothing more to perpetuate a myth to gull thoughtless people into believing in a superstitious religion."
3,3 instead of 5 stars due to lack of extras! SE anyone???,"Incredible movie, but not one to watch just anytime. Very disappointed that there don't seem to be any special features. This cries out for TONS of extras! How about a director's commentary? Mel supplied the whole $25 million budget out his own pocket, so there must be really interesting behind-the-scenes discussion. And how about documentaries on the accuracy and controversy surrounding the launch of the movie. It just deserves this treatment."
1,Ludicrous violence for the sake of violence,"There is nothing ""real"" or ""realistic"" about Gibson's portrayal of violence in this movie. It is, quite simple, an orgiastic celebration of pain and suffering. See the bad guys sneer and laugh as the blood splatters their faces with full Dolby sound effects! In many ways the violence in ""Kill Bill"" is more subtle than this. Regardless of its historical accuracy (who cares?), this piece of celluloid is nothing more than one opinionated director's desperate--and unintelligent--flagellation of the audience. For the time capsule called, ""The Dumbing of America,"" save room for this ridiculously overblown religious treatise that cheapens, not celebrates, the life of Christ. Pure drivel."
1,WARNING TO POSSIBLE OWNERS!!!,"This DVD is likely a ripoff! It is completely bare bones and devoid of most extras that DVD's come with. What they are doing is releasing a bare bones version now to capitalise on the people who don't know any better and want the DVD with Jesus on it. But for a movie that meant so much to Mel Gibson, it's almost certain they withheld all the features for a future version to be released during the Holidays. That includes footage and text that caused much of the controversy in the first place over the film which was cut. I'm not religious at all, but thought the film was excellent, however I would say hold off on buying this right off the bat. It's more than likely you'll hear an announcement of special edition a few days later."
1,sucks,this movie is gorey and bloody and I would not recommend that anyone see it because it will make you sick!
3,not what i remember from sunday school,"i will get straight to the point.this movie is 2 hours of jesus christ getting his butt kicked!he is beaten and tortured mocked maimed and humiliated the whole way through.i would definately never send a child to see this.there is little if any actual spiritualy helpful or enlightening information in here.unless simply to say ""look at what he went through to save your sins""."
1,Please read this,"No ""Passion"" here.""Gore"", beyond definition, is here.2/3 of the film are of the sadistic graphic beating of a man, who would have expired far beyond the efforts of the discusting, drunken Roman guards.English subtitles only.Short film. Poor character development. Must watch several times to pin down Jesus.As a Christian, I'm insulted.Mysterious flash backs abound.Has all the ambiance of a low budget art film.Confused as to the assumed and adopted threat to Jews. It's more of a threat to Christians, and an assault on the gullibility of any audience.Just another drive-by attack, buy a greedy film maker.Save your money. Please!I wish it hadn't been like this."
1,Intolerable cruelty!!!!,This movie is disgusting. The violence is utterly unbearable. And really what's the point? The movie is antisemistic yes but more then that it's anti-human. The message of the movie was supposed to be love and in fact it's just about pure hatred...
2,Unfortunate distortions and insertions cloud the storyline,"One struggles to compare details of this plot with the various Gospels. So much is added in that it is difficult for someone with only a passing knowledge of the Gospels to know what is genuine and what is added in. The addition of a Satan figure in many places is odd; the flogging episode is portrayed as violently as possible, with Jesus virtually taunting the guards to punish him further; there are times when various people are shown interacting with Jesus while he is on his way to Golgotha. There are many more and these are just off the top of my head after seeing it 6 months ago.If one is a Christian, then there is a good possibility that you will come to either hold this video in low esteem, or question your beliefs."
1,HORRIBLE TERRIBLE AWFUL DISGRACEFUL,"There was a lot of hype from people that thought this had perspectives that were prejudice against Jews. That's the first stupid thing. If a movie shows Denzel Washington getting shot, does anyone scream 'racist' because he's black? I didn't think so. It's seriously pathetic that so many people waste their time on religion."
2,"Eh...Graphic, Silly and Stupid but Expertly Produced Technical Elements","There's not much that hasn't already been said here, but basically this is a horror film (or Torture Porn for the ""Saw""/""Hostel"" crowd) that happens to be based on the Bible rather than any other book. If this film were based on historical evidence, no one would have even cared when this film came out and it would have just been a very violent Roman film similar to ""300.""Instead, the film is based on one man's (Gibson) interpretation of the Bible, so it's allowed to throw facts out the window (the location of the wounds, nudity, etc. - it's all been said by hundreds of other people) and just show crazy amounts of carnage and brutality and disturbing visuals. It's fortunate the soundtrack is brilliant, the cinematography is masterful, and Jim Caviezel gives an amazing performance, otherwise this might come across as ""Saw XIV: Mel Gibson Kills Jesus."""
3,God Is Alone,"There is another movie available only through GODISALONE.com that is a film that deals with the birth and death of Jesus without all of the gore and violence. It's called GOD IS ALONE. It is a myseterious art film that follows a sullen young man who encounters a Virgin Mary like character and her newborn baby. Through a twisted turn of events, the baby is killed and it seems that the Devil is given free reign to do what he pleases after that. But God has other plans. Check it out, Chritians, non-Christians, Jews, anyone. It's worth the watch and has a much better story than THE PASSION."
5,take it or leave it,"This is not a movie for entertainment junkies. If you want to be entertained, this is not the movie for you. The inability of some to grasp the theological content and character of this film (like those who stop short at the violence), especially the flashbacks, whose origin in Catholic Tradition and mysticism escape their appreciation, is to be expected. It was conceived in faith. Its depth requires the eyes of faith. If you don't have it, save us your pseudo-intellectual political ranting."
5,Deeper Faith,"I am 16 years old, and I saw this movie yesterday evening with 40 other students from my school's Bible class. This movie is amazing, I know the Gospels, and this was the closest representation of the movie I have ever seen, I am proud to say that I believe in Jesus Christ and that he died for me, because I am a sinner. Through the entire movie, I kept thinking that I should be the one beaten and nailed to the cross, Mel Gibson, really took a great risk making this moving, and I am glad he did, because I can now say I have a greater Faith is Jesus now, and that my whole life has changed.Gabrielle"
5,A Must See for Christians!,This is a Must See for Christians! It is hard to watch but it truly depicts the torture that Christ went through and it will cause you to shed many tears.
5,One Word: Perfect,"Passion of the Christ is one of the best films to grace the big screen. No far-fetched stories, just a man and his destiny.The music score is second to none, the acting is worthy of praise and the directing is something to be proud of.Never has the story of our Lord Jesus Christ been so well portrayed, so well shown.ABOUT DVD: The Passion of The Christ is all that is needed to make this DVD a hit. However, it contains no ""chapter listings' no printed material what-so-ever. No special features is included, not even the trailers. Quite a shame really. Thanks for including both the English and French Subtitles!A MUST BUY DVD FOR EVERYONE!"
5,No Greater Love! Spectacular! Life Changing!,"This movie was the most awe-inspiring, life changing movie I have EVER seen. I thank God for Mel Gibson and his boldness to produce such a moving film. I don't know if I cried so much because of the brutal beatings Jesus Christ took for us or because of the great LOVE I felt from the Lord Jesus because He took those stripes for me. I know I left that theater more grateful to the Lord for His great love towards us than I have or could have ever felt had I not seen it on film. I honestly felt as if I was a part of, not the movie, but the actual events that occurred during those last 12 hours in the life of Jesus. I want all the more to do all I can to please the Lord and do what I can to spread and show His love to men and women everywhere. God bless you, Mel Gibson, James Caviezi and Monica Belucci along with the entire cast and production staff."
5,hard to watch,"So real, so painful ,but Beautiful. I was brought to tears so many times.It didn't matter what language it was in."
3,Ben Hur was better,"I couldn't watch this movie, whatever its merits, more than once. There's not a lot of love in it. With all the violence the movie seems mostly designed for people who like to see whippings. The old films like Ben Hur and King of Kings do a better job of conveying Our Lord's love and suffering."
5,"Great job, Mel!","This movie does exactly what I think it was meant to do: shock the people with how Jesus was betrayed, tortured, crucified. It comes straight from the Bible. I didn't recognize any added sensation or fiction. This is how it must have been. Too cruel? Does anybody believe that what Jesus had to go through for us was anything better than what is being shown here?"
5,A must-watch!,"This is, without a doubt, one of the most impactful movies that I have ever seen. A movie not to be enjoyed, but experienced. Trust me when I say that it's an experience that could very well have life-changing effects for it's viewers. A"
4,In defense of Mel Gibson,"Do not understand the charges of anti-semitism leveled against this film. In my lifetime I've seen this story filmed countless times. From the 1961 KING OF KINGS to George Steven's gargantuan THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD to THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MATTHEW to JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR to Zefferelli's JESUS OF NAZARETH and Scorsese's THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST all telling the same story with the same cast of characters. While some of them created controversy over political or creative thinking, others generated criticism over casting choices, none of them had charges of anti-semitism hurled at them. All the good guys are Jews, all the bad guys are either Roman, Jewish high priests or non-believers. What made Mel Gibson's film so different? And why did so many people jump on the bandwagon? Except for the violence, Gibson doesn't do anything the other films didn't already do. So what lies behind all this?"
4,Good,"I'm not sure where people are getting that it's horribly violent or gorey especially compared to what we see on tv & online these days in so called news but ok. Having said that it's a very good movie the acting is great. I don't pretend to be a specialist or expert on religion, the bible or so called biblical events but over all it seemed to hold to the idea we've all heard regardless of what our religions are & doesn't seem to try to hollywood it up for effect. Highly recommend it. I haven't seen this in a while but when I did it was in the ancient language of Aramaic which supposeably is a dead language & thus needed subtitles which can make it hard to keep up or for some make the movie seem longer then it is. Still subtitles or not even if you arent religious or cant read subtitles or understand fluenant Aramaic it's still a great movie. Enough that I felt compeled to rate & comment it and I never do that even with movies I can watch a millions & never tire of."
5,Love - Pure and Simple,"This movie deserves more than five stars. Mel Gibson has given this world a gift - pure and simple. I left every negative comment - mostly from the maintstream media - outside the theater. I know, after viewing this movie - this love story, that it proves just how the media can get it WRONG. Not one person I know felt any sembelance of anti-semetic views. Not one. What we as Christians saw was Jesus taking on ALL our sins. I will not use the word Violent with this movie. It was graphic....it was difficult to watch...but, it was not Violent. It showed just how much Jesus loves all of us. To Mel Gibson, I say 'thank you' and I know you certainly had Divine help in making this movie. For all those individuals who think they'll enter the theater and find ""hate"" you are sadly mistaken. This movie is about love - Pure and Simple!"
5,Heart-Rending and Passionate,"Much has been said about this movie and you've probably heard all you need to hear about it. To me, it was a violent albeit beautifully made movie. It has heart; it's brutal, poignant, moving, and heart breaking. It's obvious Mel Gibson poured his heart and soul into the making of The Passion of the Christ. Was it anti-Semitic? I didn't think so.With all the controversy swirling around The Passion, my best recommendation is to go see the movie and decide for yourself."
5,JESUS IS LORD,"""The Passion of the Christ"" affirmed for me the essential Truth of my life, which is that Jesus Christ is Lord. With free will I do make the choice and proclaim in any and all ways for all to know that I believe in Him, I reject Satan and all his works, Jesus died for my sins, and that I am a terrible sinner whose salvation can only come about through the forgiveness of Christ."
5,The ultimate love story.,People who don't like it because of the gore. Let me tell you something. The gore scenes in this film are extremley grade school compared to the way it really happened. There has never been or ever will be a civilization as decadent and barbaric as the roman empire. They were masters of torture and what the Jesus Christ suffered in this film was nothing even close to what the real Jesus Christ endured for us so we wouldn't have to go to Hell. The Non Christian who watches this film can not truly appreciate the love Jesus had for us going to the cross like the Christian can. Watch it not the gore scenes. You want to see gore watch Dawn Of The Dead or The Burning Moon. You want a true love story watch this film.
5,A Classic Potrayal!,"This portrayal is without a doubt .... the most moving and almost true,to life potrayal of the life, death and resurrection, of our Savior! Mel Gibson and Jim Caviezel made me believe that I present, when Jesus was crucified .... it was so real!This movie ranks, with the very best!"
5,a blessing,"This movie changed how I look at the Bible,Jesus and my relationship with the Lord. What blessing to know how much God the Father and Jesus the Son loves us. Be prepared to cry but then changed forever:) Wonderful movie."
4,The Beating of the Christ,"I don't know what I felt. I was both overwhelmed by the movie's violence as well as saddened. So I suppose Mel Gibson may have served his purpose. The movie was incredibly violent. You have no choice but to pity and admire a man who would not strike back from being beaten to death.However, I would have been more interested in seeing the teachings of Jesus and his influence on his followers. This would have best depicted the Passion of Christ. How he lived would have been more inspirational than how he died. It's his teachings that are remembered and taught through the ages. But I suppose Mel Gibson wants his film to be different from all the other films about Christ.I love the historical accuracy and the use of the Latin and Aramaic. The acting was superb. Imagine learning to speak and ACT in a tongue that no longer is used.All in all, the film deserves some sort of oscar."
5,Very vivid account of Christ's Life,This was painful to watch in many scenes........It was touching to see Christ portrayed so intimately.Not for younger children.
4,One of the most violent jesus films,"What can you say about a film like this one.It is very graphicand violent.But it tells what really happened to christ.Being filmed in italy,it gives a set that makes you feel likle you arereally their.It also gives some fictonial parts like satan in the garden of gethsemane.This film begins at the garden of gethsemane and ends at the open tomb.It is really very bloddy.But, mary is with him all the way.Mary`s grief at the cross turns to joy when she sees him at the open tomb.Children 8 and under should not see this film."
5,the passion of the christ,the movie was excellent. the characters performance was excellent and i love Mel Gibson
2,"Great Movie, LOUSY DVD.","Simple and short. THUMBS UP to the movie, although extremely BRUTAL and not for the fant of heart. HOWEVER, THUMBS DOWN to this DvD for the LACK of special features. If you JUST want the movie, then buy the DvD, you won't be disappointed, BUT this was a MAJOR MOVIE and a lack of special features is a HUGE SLAP IN THE FACE. I'm SURE they'll release a special edition sooner or later that'll probably be LOADED with extras, so I'd wait till then to buy it. For now, just rent it and enjoy the movie."
2,Misses the Whole POINT of Christ!,"While this is a powerful movie and very dramatically acted, I think it misses the major point of Jesus on the cross. The director seems so obsessed with portraying physical pain and suffering inflicted by humans (which he does gruesomely well) that he fails to show Jesus's major reason for suffering.It was Jesus's brief seperation from God the Father on the cross that was far more terrible than any physical suffering. This was his sacrifice so we can be forgiven for our sins. After spending all eternity in loving company together, that period when God cut him off emotionally was pure hell. The same hell that we put ourselves through in life when we isolate ourselves from God's love.I appreciate the effort of Gibson, but I think the film falls fall short."
5,This movie was The Absolute Best thing I have ever witnessed,This movie was amazing. There has never been anything better in the world. It brought me to a devine realization of what Jesus went through to save our sins. I cried throughout the hole thing. Even a few of my friends who are non beleivers cried. It moved a lot of people. At the end of the film when the credits started rolling everybody in the audience just sat there in awe crying and sitting in silence. Normally everybody would just get up and walk out and start talking with their friends and family. This was an experience you can not put to words. I will never experience anything like this again. It was amazing!
1,Fantasies,"There is no doubt that Christ suffered, but there is absolutely no biblical or historical evidence for much of the content of this film. Impressive visuals and sound cannot change the fact that this effort is overloaded not with historical truths, but with Gibson's fantasies. Of course he has the right to display his version of events, but the rest of us need not be fooled."
1,A truly gorey movie,"Putting all of the religious aspects aside and merely reviewing this movie, it is one of the goriest, bloodiest, most depressing movies I've seen in years. I certainly would not recommend it for youngsters.When addressing the religious aspects, this does not capture any aspect of the goodness of man or God and reflects very little of the teachings of Jesus or that time. I'm really not sure what the point of the movie was other than to capture how vicious and cruel people can be to each other. We only need to turn on the nightly news to see that. Not a movie worth seeing."
1,What's the message?,"I think the real message here is how a great marketing plan can turn a Mel-indulgent, suffering-fest into a blockbuster. Congratulations on your marketing Mel, but boo to your vision. Most of the people in the film are caricatures, devoid of one iota of consciense.WWJD? I think he would have walked out of the theatre into the sunlight. Jesus had a simple message. Too bad we continue to Muck it up."
2,Too much beating,"The movie is punctuated by unfortunate series of continuous beating. Any human being with massive strength would not have been able to sustain such number of flagellations using whips with pointed hooks and nails.The holy Bible does NOT refer to the degree of such ill-treatments, for example the 'scene' when the Cross was 'trundled' on the hill and fell on the dusty ground, with Christ face down.Even the 'abduction' of Christ was transformed into a frenzied activity with exaggerations when they hit Him repeatedly so as to inflict pain until He fell over the road side, chained.We know the Camera can do marvels, but behind it there ought to be reasonable interpretation of events that should take precedence over smart technology."
2,Not at all what I was expecting,"This movie was mostly focused on the persecution of Jesus Christ. While this was probably all it was supposed to be, I was expecting the life of Jesus as told in the Bible with all the ""miracles"" included and him spreading messages. Not at all what I expected."
5,Very realistic portrayal,"It was almost like being there. Some have said it was too bloody. I think that in the current social climate, people are so desensitized by gore in the media, movies, television, etc. that the sanitized versions of the passion are inadequate. People today are very visual, so I thank Gibson for giving us a more realistic version. I look forward to more films with this vision of detail and accuracy."
4,"All it promised, but nothing more.","This movie was dramatic and powerful. It told a story that many people already know, but it added a human and disturbing element with so much violence and so little compassion that the few spots where a kinder, more sincere character surfaced, it restored one's faith in humanity. With little dialog and hardly no explaination, this movie could've been better only if it showed more of the life of Christ and just why his deflectors where so threatened. Still, it's a must see for any one questioning our history, Christian or not."
1,Even the best Christian can live without this...,"I consider myself to be open-minded and a huge Mel Gibson fan. But, I was only able to make it through about 10 minutes of this movie before turning it off. Controversy is an undestatement about the story, the message, etc. The world has enough darkness. So, I'm going to stick with what I've been taught, and leave my images of God and Jesus in the precious state they are in my mind and heart."
1,Suffering without redemption,This ghastly film was so violent that by its end I simply felt numb; it couldn't possibly be uplifting.
2,Ouch,"I thought I was Christian until I saw this film; then suddenly the whole thing seemed absurd to me. What kind of a God would demand or be appeased by this kind of greusome suffering on the part of anyone? Rather than strengthen my faith, this film made me wince about it. That ain't good, folks."
1,very bad,"sad and disillusioned, the product supposedly came ... but it's time that I have it in my hands, I never reported. and Devold me money. very bad. I've been robbed."
5,"Awesome,Awesome,Awesome!!!!!!",The Passion of the Christ is a vey beautiful movie. The best movie I have ever seen!!
5,The Passion of the Christ,"Jews didn't kill Him. Romans didn't kill Him.""Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends."" (John 15:13, NASB95)Jesus laid down His own life voluntarily. He is the Paschal Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world. The sin of mankind took Him to the cross. Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins. You can look at this film in 3 ways: 1) Look what they did to Him; 2) Look what I did to Him; or 3) Look what He did for me! Thank You Lord.Maranatha!Mike"
2,"God bless Him, however disappointing","As a man, a prophet, the son of God...or any other way you see him, no one in their right mind would argue the greatness of Jesus Christ. His philosophy, teachings, and sacrifices are beyond comprehension.However, i was not impressed with this movie. The graphic detail that showed what he went through was moving, yes, but that was the whole movie. Everyone knows what Jesus went through, so I didn't see it as necessary to drag it out for 2 hours with occasional flashbacks.I think it was like watching Braveheart, but having the movie begin where Wallace was captured, and covering for the most part his trial and torture, and ultimate death. Then adding intermitent flashbacks of other parts of the movie. I appologize to anyone this may offend, i recoginize that this is a sensitive subject, but I'm unimpressed.*Final point: this may be some of the best cinematography I've ever seen. from that aspect I would give the movie six stars."
4,Can Mel Gibson reveal from what's fact and what's false?,"In one of the most controversial movies in a long time, Oscar winner Mel Gibson takes the director's chair to command the story of Jesus of Nazareth and his final hours of his cruxifiction. I had a chance to see it... it was the most traumatizing expierence I ever sat through in a movie. It was powerful and emontionally real. I won't reveal any details, except that it has graphic violence and disturbing images. You'll probably won't really understand the film because it was filmed in the Arabic language. Fellow Catholic Mel Gibson does a meaningful job as director, despite sometimes offending the viewer with its graphic details with Jesus' final hours. Many people today still doubt Jesus even lived in our history, but Gibson did a solid job from bringing to life such a neglectful project such as this."
1,Degenerated,"Many people think Mel Gibson is a good actor and a good director, when he just makes people waste their time. I've seen this movie it's a real degeneration, the things Mel Gibson has thought for Jesus' last days shows what's in his mind, the way he is. You better not waste your time with this degeneration."
1,Not Inspired,"Let me start out by saying that I am a Roman Catholic and I truly believe in the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. I found this movie to simply be 126 minutes of torture. I was not inspired or moved in any way. It was a total waste of my time. I wondered whatever possessed Mel Gibson to make this movie, and have come the conclusion that it must be the $500 million he has made on it. I understand that it is being re-released in time for Easter with six minutes of the brutality being cut out, like that will make this disgusting, ugly movie any more palatable."
1,It never ends,"It's embarassing to be Christian in a world that supports nasty hate like this movie. I am ashamed of Mel Gibson and his mean spirited attempt to arouse hatred among people. But, after hearing on CNN that his own father insists that the Holocaust never happened, it is understandable, considering how he was raised. Too bad he doesn't put his talents into something less violent and less hateful. Religion is not about hate...it is about love and this movie is anything but about love."
1,A Late night horror flick,"I should have left this review a long time ago. I could kick myself for buying it, thinking it was a film, not a religous object. If you critisize this film amongst religious radicals, you risk being burned at the stake, an act of love to purify your soul.This film,as a film, disregarding the topic, is a dog. A cheap ""B"" grade, blood spurting, flesh flying horror flick in Aramaic with sub-titles. I could go on for an hour, but won't bother."
2,one incredible scene,"There is one incredible scene in this movie - a scene that perhaps makes the entire movie worth the price. It is the scene in which Jesus is finishing building a table and bouncing on it while have a friendly conversation with his mother. In that scene one can see a Jesus of love, humanity, and compassion not evident in the gross misinterpretations of the Bible that have come to commandeer his name. It is a glimpse of what the real Jesus might have been like - learning the wisdom of the ancients as he emerged from childhood through his lost years until returning to the Bible at thirty.The rest of the movie is pretty awful. It had no character development - the king of a religious sect getting beaten senseless does not a good movie make. Anyone raised Christian will see nothing but the same old tired interpretations, essentially reinforcing the status quo without a thought of its actual validity."
1,Profoundly offensive,"I usually don't write bad reviews - I prefer to praise movies that I love. But I found this film deeply and profoundly offensive. All I kept thinking while I was being repulsed is ""What is Mel Gibson doing? What is his agenda?"". It seems to me that this masochistic, Catholic guilt-ridden travesty misses the entire point of Jesus' crucifixion. Wouldn't this great spiritual leader want us to focus on the message of eternal life - there is no death - rather than the suffering?"
2,A Great Reason to Be Buddhist!!!,"I am giving this film an extra star (moving it up to 2) because of the fine production values and amazing gore effects. This movie is great for people who loved the ""Saw"" pictures, just for the agony and torture.But seriously, why is it that so few people object to the idea that extreme violence is sacred somehow? We have been taught for centuries that there is something divine about violence, and that cruelty is something that God (or the Big Whatever) needs in some way. We have even been taught to equate a demand for horrible violence with God's love. Is it any wonder that we have so much violence in our society, against people,animals and the environment? How 'bout that karma! Well, enough of my soapbox. If you believe in a bloodthirsty sadist in the sky, then this one's for you! Don't forget the popcorn!"
1,Cash cow ...,"Some one needs to tell Mel that the voices he heard was more like cash registers ringing in his ears. Sick man making money and showing his version. Typical of a Hollywood actor trying to be cool with being ""in""."
5,Definitive Difference,"I've been awaiting this two DVD collection for almost a year now and I can say that it was well worth the wait. This set includes the theatrical (original) version and a new ""recut"" version with I've come to call ""the PG-13 cut"" becuase it removes around three or four minutes of the harsh violence toward Christ that the theatrical version contained. The recut version is the cut most likely to be shown by churches and viewed by families due to the fact that the level of violence and bloodshed is greatly reduced. I aslo have to mention the special features on the second DVD. All the features are wonderful and very informative. As a student of film it is very interesting to see how Mel Gibson and crew created this Biblical epic. There are also features that just focus on the Biblical history and truth of Christ and his followers that have nothing to do with the making of the film. This is a DVD worth the purchase price."
5,It's A Must See,"I have a very close relationship to Jesus and the faith I have in him is very strong. I've struggled throughout my life physically going in and out of hospitals with surgeries and procedures. Through this, I've always felt that Christ was always near me in my most trying times as a young child to my adult years. He's never given up on me and I'll never give up on him.When I first heard of the movie, I was curious to see how Mel Gibson would portray it. When it was finally released, part of me wanted to see it while the other part didn't. In a way, I felt I had to because in a way, I was there with him through *his* most trying times in his life. He was there for me when I was struggling, and by me watching him I was there for him. I was glad I saw it, but I will most likely never see it again. Once is enough for me. :)I really do recommend people see this. Not only as a religious point of view, but as a learning experience for all."
3,Not what I expected,"This film definitely surprised me. I expected a theological lecture, but in fact Mad Mel has simply taken some Bible bits and turned them into a slasher flick with a twist. In a typical slasher, there's one bad guy chopping up a lot of people. In this one, there's loads of bad guys slicing up one person.Of course, on a more serious level, the film is an excellent illustration of the insanity of religion. But that's a topic for another forum."
5,Best movie ever,"I have to say that this is the best movie I have ever seen. I feel that this movie is so powerful because it is true. It may not be 100% accurate, but the message and the feeling behind it is the truth. This is to date, the best portrayl of Christ's final hours ever put on film. Since it was directed by Mel Gibson and stars Jim Caviezel, you know that alot of time and effort, and research, went onto the making of this film. I think that any creed of Christianity should see this and know exactly what was done for us. My only complaint, and it is minor,it that there wasn't more shown in the garden of Gethsemene, since it was it fact the most important part of His sacrifice. But other than that, it is perfect. I was crying though out the entire movie, so I recommend a box of tissues."
4,Passionately done,"I have seen many adaptations of the life of Jesuschrist... this is by far the one that has made me cry the most. In this world we live in now, religion (especially Christianity) is accepted less and less each time, so when a movie like this comes out, of course it would be controversial. After all, when was the last time that a religious movie came out with such impact? Probably never. I'd like to clarify that Gibson's intention was NOT to try to convert people, he just wanted to portray his vision of the last hours of our Lord. This movie is great, but it's not for children or people that are weak of heart. The images are too strong. Christian or not, this movie would make any one cry... nobody is heartless. There are so many negativities surrounding this movie, you be the judge if you decide to watch the film."
5,You must own this,"Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ is one of the most powerful films that I have ever seen. Honestly, I really do not care about the various controversies surrounding the film... some say that Gibson's interpretation was too literal, some say that his film was a pendulum reaction to Da Vinci code where he has attempted to please the church, some have even said that the film is anti-Semitic. Honestly I don't care. I wept through most of this movie and I can't remember when I last did that (probably Schindler's List). Yes, it's bloody. But that's precisely what Gibson wanted to show... the sheer hell of the final hours of Christ. You have to own this because it's a movie that you will need to watch every now and again to remind us of the harshness of life when we start getting down with minor irritants in our everyday lives."
4,A movie to meditate on.,"Many people are ""horrofied"" by the film's violence. Contrary to other films the violence was based on fact and had it's purpose. It's sad that today's world is full of cynicism and hate. I think this is one of the main reasons many people don't understand Christ's sacrifice and His love for us all. As a result the ""bashers"" hate the film.As we drift away from love, less we comprehend God's ways. Let us at least try it for once. . .As for the movie, I loved it. It has made a big impact my life and strengthened my faith. I recommend this movie to everyone who is serious on their search for God. This movie along with good Spiritual Direction can bring many spiritual fruits.The only thing that dissapointed me was the lack of ""extras"" on the DVD. That's the reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. A making of documentary, deleted scenes, movie inspiration sources along with other interesting features could've been added. Let's hope a Special Edition gets released."
3,"Long, Bloody - Too Violent","This movie is too much about the screenwriters interpretation of religion and their obsession with violence and not enough about the glorious creative & loving God of our world. There is only one God of our world, the creator. Yet, there are hundreds of man-made church organizations. Looking back through history one will see that the conflicts of man-made ideologies are a major source of war and other types of violence. We do not need this type of violent movie to have faith in our God.A movie composed of violence is exploitative of its viewers. There are no exceptions. Violence breeds evil and should not be depicted in any excess just for storytelling."
2,The bias of Mel Gibson's Christ,"I find it very poor taste that Mel Gibson being a self proclaimed misogynist, would protray the ""devil"" as a woman. You could confirm it in the cast credits. I was very uncomfortable with this film and also this bias. I doubt very much if Jesus Christ would desire us to see 2 hours of brutal graphic torture and only brief, but beautiful moments of his teaching and resurection."
1,Pathetic ..,This movie came 400 years too late. We might've belived in all this nonsense in the 14th century but for an adult to be brainwashed to the extent that they actually take this fairytale for real is scary. You don't belive in Zeus. You're an atheist to Poseidon and Allah. So you know what it's like to be an atheist. Normal people just go one god further.
1,Abomination,To start this movie is totally wrong. Unlike others may believe this movie did not follow the way it was supposed to. Not to mention we were never supposed to know the physical burden Christ went through. It is just Inhumane. and on top of that Aramaic is not the language they spoke. It was Greek. That is exactly the original language of the Bible. Read any introduction to any Bible and IT WILL say that. I made the mistake of watching this travesty. For those of you who haven't don't. It will break your heart.
1,not based on the Bible.,"Much of the material in this film was based on the writings of Anne Catherine Emmerich, a 19th century German nun.It contains many scenes that are part of Catholic tradition but found nowhere in the Bible. This film is Mel Gibson's account of the Crucifixion, not the Bible's.Sadly this film is widely endorsed by many evangelical ""Christian"" movements. The film is very ecumenist and not anti-semitic."
2,Worst Movie that I ever saw,"I can sum it up in one sentence: The Worst Movie that I ever saw. I know that Christs last hours were horrifying, but this movie, the way it is cut, goes way beyond what the Bible says. It is like he wanted to make the goriest movie of all times, not a factual account of Christs last hours. It was so bad that I couldnt watch the whole movie. I wish the Mel Gibson had made a ""REAL"" movie of his last hours. Save your money, and read the bible for the truth."
1,Depressing but in a Bad Way,"I can't find this film moving in any degree. It is disturbingly graphic but not in an entertaining way (e.g. Pulp Fiction) or in a way that shakes the viewer's consciousness (e.g. the Grey Zone). Instead it presents a deeply dogmatic and outdated view of the final days of Jesus. I am non religious yet I have seen films that opened the minds of viewers on the subject of Jesus from The Last Temptation of Christ to The Gospel According to Saint Matthew to Jesus of Montreal. What we have here instead is Mel Gibson's Birth of a Nation with a disturbing ideology that was savagely and appropriately lampooned on South Park's ""The Passion of the Jew"" (kudos to Blockbuster for putting the two titles for rent next to each other)."
1,Yikes,"This movie is simply a sensationalist gore-flick. If you're looking for a meaningfull religious movie based upon scriptures accepted by main-stream religious leaders, then look elsewhere."
5,The Passion of the Christ,"Probably one of the most controversial films of 2004, but one of the best movies i have seen in my life (along with ""The Matrix""). Mel Gibson has made a masterpiece by far."
1,They left out the important part,"Has there ever been a movie about Jesus that hasn't been controversial? The controversy alone renders this film boring - I've seen more useless writing about this one, when there's probably only about five biblical scholars in the world who could comment intelligently on it. Anyway, as for the film itself, must needs we sit through 100 greusome minutes of Christ being beaten, tortured, crucified, etc.? I suspect the story of Christ's teachings or of his resurrection might have helped balance this grim film and add a spiritual dimension to its fleshy mess. The Gospels are, after all, ""good news"", whereas this gore fest turns it into a withering spectacle of numb suffering. I seek not to discount the sufferings of Christ, merely to suggest that endless graphic shots of him or anyone else being whipped aren't likely to do us any good. If a movie about Jesus makes us sick to our stomach, are we likely to pursue any interest in faith?"
2,I guess if you want to see your savior ripped to shreds...,"Why all the horrible blood and gore? Straight out of a B zombie zombie movie. Yeah, I get that it's supposed to empasize the pain and suffering that Jesus went through to cleanse you of your sins but was all of it needed? The movie The God Who Wasn't There did a minute-by-minute tally of blood, violence, gore, etc. All but the first 10 minutes and 6 later minutes contained things you'd expect to see in a horror movie. Gibson=sadist?"
1,Go to Church,"Everybody says that this movie has done more for there religion than anything. How about going to church? This just goes to show that unless it hasn't been made into a movie, it ain't important. I'm not a religous person because the whole thing is knida.....stupid. Mel Gibson knows that by putting out this movie religous people will go to see it, hence he makes all the money. One thing though, I would rather have one movie to sum it all up than some shi#y musical group."
1,Torture,"The film was like having a ringside seat in the Torture Chamber. The gruesome graphic detail becomes so unreal, no man (including the human Son of God) could ever survive. Theologically unsound: the penalty to be paid for the world's Sin was death of the Christ - not His everlasting torture. The Resurrection merits a two minute post-script, hardly an appropriate balance for Easter which is still part of the Passion. Mel Gibson is clearly working through some personal faith issues in this film, I'm just saddened that he paints Chritianity with unrelenting, harrowing and sadistic pleasure."
3,Disappointing,"After hearing reviews about this film being antisemtic, I have to disagree. As well, I didn't find it nearly as gory as I thought it would be. It is Roman soldiers who cane Jesus, who scourge him, who beat him, insult him, spit on him, press a crown of thorns onto his head and crucify him, all on the orders of a Roman procurator. And nobody in their right mind would ever accuse the film of being anti-Italian, just as I have never heard anyone accusing, say, Schindler's List of being anti-German.There were no 'surprises' since this is an old story that people already know - Jesus is arrested, accused, not necessarily found guilty but sentenced by the people anyhow, beaten, then given a cross to drag up a hill where he is to be crucified. Once there he is nailed to the cross, and shortly thereafter, he dies. His body is taken down, put in a mausoleum, and the next morning, he is risen. End of story. That's it."
5,"""THERE IS NO GREATER LOVE THAN THIS"" -Steven Curtis Chapman","""The Passion of the Christ"" is an amazing experience. Never has the story of Christ's sacrifice for the sins of all mankind been shown more realistic, or more true! Gibson has crafted a masterpiece of filmmaking. Jim Caviezel is the most convincing Jesus ever to grace the movie screen! As for the anti-Semitism, it does not exist in this film! It shows how far Christ was willing to go to make sure that sin has no grasp on any of us!If you're doubting your faith, or you're wondering if there is more to life than what is around you, then I highly recommend this film! It will change your life! Grade: A+"
4,Not as Good as the Hype,"This was not as good as they hype. In itself, it was watchable and fairly accurate. Yes, it tended to glamourize the violence a little more than it needed to get the point across. I would have preferred that the ending be extended several minutes (women, apostles, etc.), but it was fitting with the ""passion"" aspect of the title. Overall, decent flick, but don't get your expectations too high."
5,Powerful truth,"First I would like to say thank you to Mel Gibson. You have delivered the most powerful movie that I have ever seen. Even with all of the controversy, you have stood by your film and I salute your commitment and passion for your work and your faith.This is an amazing movie. Yes, there are very many appalling scenes of Jesus being beaten and crucified. This movie made me tear up in many parts, especially when Jesus saw his mother Mary and gained strength, after a brutal lashing, to continue carrying his cross to his eventual death. This movie really made me realize one thing. Any time that I feel as though I am sacrificing alot, I will think back on the punishment Jesus recieved for our sins and realize how ridiculous I am."
5,convicting,"not a ""get some popcorn and milk duds"" movie. Very convicting for the Christian believer. Makes you realize what the crucifixion was. If you are a Christian, watch it. Thank God for sending his Son. Thank Christ for going through that."
5,"FOUR WORDS, ""A TRUE RELIGIOUS EPIC!""",This movie is a lot more than a so-called bloodfest and being equal to Finding Nemo. For those that think Finding Nemo has more religious value there is no hope for them. The Passion of Christ will make everyone who sees it realize what Jesus Christ did for us as sinners.
2,Decent special effects.,"When I first watched the Passion in the theaters, about a month after it was first released (!!), I wasn't really impressed with anything in it. From all the hype, it sounded like it would be a gore-fest. I'll admit it was gory, but not nearly as gory as I was hoping.I went to see it a second time with one of my friends and I ended up laughing through most of the movie. Not at the movie, which was no longer interesting, but at the audience. Listening to those lunatics is hilarious. I was sitting next to some old lady and I thought she was going to have a stroke by the end of the film.Maybe today's youth has been a little desensatized by TV and whatnot or maybe today's older population is just a bunch of pansies. Who knows?"
5,The Passion of the Christ !!!!!!,"Mel Gibson out did himself. What a wonderful portrayal of the suffering Christ did for us. The stories within the Story were excellent. The whole movie made you feel like you were there. When Jesus was being beaten, I felt as if I had caused this to happen to him - and in actuality, I had. It was for OUR - EVERYONES! sin that he had to die. What a wonderful gift Jesus gave us and what a great movie to show us of His love. Great Job Mel!!!!!!!"
3,I'm not Passionate over this version,"I was very disappointed with the DVD version of ""Passion of the Christ"". I saw the movie when it was first released last year. The acting, the music, the use of Aramaic/Hebrew/Latin in the film with the English subtitles, were all superb.Enter the DVD version. The cinema and actors of course are great, but there is a narrator giving me a blow by blow (pun intended) running commentary of what I am watching on the screen, and another one reading the English subtiltles to me. The whole mood and atmosphere of the original movie is totally lost, and it seems to detract somewhat from the superb acting. It's as though someone decided they were going to make a movie for the blind.Save your money on this DVD and buy The Book. Then you can read the original accounts by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John."
5,Like being there with Jesus / Life changing!!!,Unparalleled movie about Jesus. I went to see this with my wife and we both sat there in awe knowing that this is what Jesus had done for us to pay for our sins. When the movie was over we really couldn't talk. We left the theater quietly and the silence was the same in the car on the way home. I even tried to turn on some beautiful worship music and somehow it seemed shallow. I had to turn the music off. Only quiet would do. This movie was an experience not entertainment. I found myself pondering within myself for days after. I am grateful to Mel Gibson for his movie and of course to Jesus for paying the penalty for my sins.
4,NICE SALE,"I WANTED THIS MOVIE FOR XMAS, BUT WAS A LITTLE SHORT ON CASH.THE QUALITY OF THE DVD WAS EXCELLENT ,AND THE PRICE WAS EXTREMELYINVITING."
2,ninetynine,not much to sayanother attempt to make a movie about the life of jesus christ.sub titled while a foreign language is spoken.if you really want to see a depiction of the life of jesus christ then i think you will probably enjoy this film.otherwise you might be bored.
1,What Rubbish,You fools so you beleave in god well your being played like a puppet on a string.If you look at the size of our plannet compared to the rest of the known univers it isn't even a grain of sand on the eaths serface.So if your going to beleive in something as stupid as jesus and god you might as well beleive in something slightly more relistic like aliens.This movie is a prime e.g of how stupid the masses realy are and how thay can be conned into almost anything.If your going to rent or buy a religious movie i suggest Monty Pithons Life Of Brien it makes a hell of a lot more sense.
2,Not a well scripted film,The greatest problem is that this film does not have any context. It starts in the middle of an event and ends 12 hours later after an orgy of blood (...). Historicaly the film is dishonest. The characters are not developed. The director is just trying to shock the audience with sensless violence. Not a very good film.
1,Passion,"Lol, this is a total rip off from the bible. Let me save you apointless hour and a half by saying Jesus died. Weak hero, didn't even put up a fight."
2,"Powerful movie, but nothing more","I'm sick of people taking this movie to be the ultimate word of God. For one thing it cannot be biblically accurate because the four accounts of the Gospels are all a little different, and it would be impossible without re shooting scenes to be true to all four accounts...In my opinion this movie used two very effective techniques to pull in millions... Unbridled violence, and strong religious symbolism. Despite the unrealistic/inaccurate depiction, excessive violence, pointless hype, possibly greedy motives, and the people who beliebe the movie to be the gospel according to Mel Gibson, this film is still a powerful piece of art.It got two stars from me because it is such an effective piece of art. The use of Arameic and Latin with English subtitiles, flashbacks (which were terrible in themselves) and dramatic music make this a masterpiece of film."
1,One of the Worst Movies of All Time - No Stars,"This movie is hype and inappropriate. Seeing blood and gore from the moment the movie begins until the moment the movie ends is not what Christ was all about. Love, compassion and forgiveness, that's what Jesus is about not this portrayal of his last days on earth. Are the masses really asses? I guess so, if they truly believe this is a good movie, or for that matter a heart moving movie.I suggest seeing ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"", or ""Jesus of Nazareth"" These movies represent excellent acting and a portrayal of the life of Jesus that is accurate and complete. The Passion shows the agony but no ecstasy and that's it. Those who know the bible know what Jesus went thru on his last days on earth as a man. Depicting only the gore is not necessary and uncalled for. Anyone can chop out a moment of time out of context and call it something more than what it is. And that is what Mel Gibson did here."
2,Christianity is THE Devil's Trick,"I am not a Christian and I cannot say that I particularly enjoyed this movie, even though at times it really made me think. I have long thought that Christianity is a tool of mass control and psychological manipulation. The Passion really gave me the sense of Christianity as the worship of the killing of god and the worship of the ascendancy of man. With the gross amount of genocide, pain, and suffering that Christianity has been responsible for, as well as the respressive contributions it has given Western Society (not to mention the fear driven obliteration of indigenous societies), I really believed that it has served the purpose it was instiutionalized to serve. Think about it."
1,Technically not the Christ and probably Altruistic Suicide..,"If one looks at it, Jesus BECAME the Christ AFTER the Resurrection. It was Jesus who suffered through His Passion. It was the Christ who came back victorious.With all the technical input Gibson probably had, no one noticed this flaw.Secondly, this is Gibson pontificating.Thirdly, why glorify the violence done to someone? People are murdered every day of the week. Tortured, brutalized and killed. So why is so ""revolutionary"" and compelling when we see it happening to the one who orchestrated His own death?Ouch, did I say He orchestrated His death? Oooops, I did. Jesus, if being a God, could lay to waste anything and anyone who raised a hand to Him. Yet, He didn't. He therefore saw His own death a benefit to others, and did not escape the event as any normal person would who values their life above all things, AS WE'RE TAUGHT. This is Altruistic Suicide.Why is what He did so phenomenal?"
3,A Bit of the Old Ultra Violence,"If you enjoyed Stanley Kubrick's ClockWork Orange, you'll like this film. It was nothing more than a long winded film of the good old ""Ultra Violence"". Yes, it was anti-Semitic, or biblically accurate whatever suits your religion, whether you're a Jew or a Christian or if you're into that sort of thing. I viewed the movie for its face value which was nothing more than a mere long video of Jesus getting his A** kicked, which was not only unrealistic because the frail actor that they chose for the movie would have collapsed within the first thirty minutes of the brutal beating he was receiving. The most interesting character in the film was Satan who was portrayed by Rosalinda Celentano who just kept lurking around in the background with those eerie androgynous looks. However with all the hype about this movie, it is a must see, and that's why I waited until it was in the video stores because I already knew what to expect."
2,You know how it ends,"Not much to see here, it is frankly close to unwatchable.The decision to use the native language of the time was an excellent one, however, and adds some authenticity to the film that is fresh and new.The sheer uniqueness of the movie makes it worth a look, but it is not entertaining at all."
1,over kill,"I wanted to see the film and I had no illusion that there would be violence. Although the film was technically well made(good acting, etc), I thought the two hour focus of beatings was over the top. This did not leave me with any 'heavy' message, or mind stimulating concepts. I have known for some time that the masses follow their leaders, and as long as people have attachments to their judgements love does not happen.Jesus was unjustly crucified as presented, however, to depict beating a 'dead horse' was as close to absurd as one can get, and lost its appeal as a 'movie' or a 'message.' No wonder people walked out. And no, I don't think this will become a great piece of art that one enjoys viewing at different times. Once is enough for this viewer."
1,No entertainment value.,"This film was a bad film based soley on entertainment value. I don't see the necessity in a gore fest where Jesus Christ is involved. If there were any FIRST hand accounts of this brutality, this film may have more substance. Seems that Gibson has his own spirituality on his sleeve. I don't think that creates art or has any entertainment value. Certainly blood and unrelenting violence is NOT entertaining. Nor does this film have ANY artistic value. The dialect isn't presented well here either. The Aramaic voice isn't given justice here, given the horridly poor interpretation and it's presentation. This film is trash. Simply. God bless."
1,"Mel Gibson, the new Judas","Yes, Mel Gibson has crucified Jesus and has filled his pockets with gold. I hear he's fighting to get the Golden Idol too. When he raises it high I guess the Christians here will bow down before it. Okay, this review is harsh, but so is Mel Gibson's torturing movie! I guess those who don't really know the word of God feel more cleansed by going to a movie and crying. I don't think that's what God or Jesus had in mind. But the believers here are more than happy to follow Mel. Sad."
3,"INRI -- ""I'm Nailed Right In""","I saw this glorified snuff film with Monty Python's ""Life of Brian"" on a double feature. While Gibson displays a certain puckish wit in his depiction of the last days of the historical Jesus, he has nothing like the superbly satiric edge that the Python troupe bring to this evergreen yarn.Always look on the bright side of Life!"
3,From a 13 year old,I am one of those people who has loved Jesus all my life. I saw the Passion of the Christ when it came out on DVD and I couldn't finish it. It is a very moving experiance but it was so hard to watch your god being clobbered by a bunch of street urchins. I think that if you don't have a close realtionship with Jesus than this movie is perfect for you. But if you already love Jesus than I would not see it. Personally I don't need Mel Gibson to teach me about religion when I have about 100 copies of the bible in my house.
5,A Great Movie,I saw The Passion last night and for the last few weeks I have heard people have been saying that this anti-semistist. However it was not. The movie is very powerful and watch for it to be nominated next year at the academy awards. It was very gory but it stayed true to the Bible.
5,A powerful film,"I'll keep this short...This is a VERY good film, the acting superb.This is not an anti-jew movie, just the last hours of Christ as told in the gospels.This is a movie the like of Schindlers list, not an entertaining movie but an important one."
2,Deserves an NC-17,If this movie was about anything else other than the passion of Christ the very people who support it would be screaming to ban it. This is an incredibly violent film with needless buckets of blood. Seeing the son of God turned into hamburger did not inspire me or increase or decrease my faith. Truly awful acting from secondary and tertiary actors and blatant homophobia in the Herod portion of the film add to a nasty mix. Good acting from primary actors and superior cinematography are the few saving graces. The bold decision to make this multi-lingual and subtitled also deserves to be tried again. Only for fundamentalist Christians and devout Roman Catholics and not be viewed by anyone under 17.
5,"All I can say is ""Wow""","Wow. Wow. Wow. This movie is quite honestly the most amazing I've ever seen in my entire life. Mel Gibson really did a great job of showing what Jesus went through to save us. Sure, the film was extremely graphic and violent, but that's exactly how it happened: violently.When I say I loved the movie, I don't mean I loved it for how it was made or the stunning special effects... I mean that I love it because it gives us an idea of what really happened during those last 12 hours, and what our Saviour endured to take our sin away.I hope that everyone who sees this movie is somewhat changed, or at last goes away feeling something from God in their hearts. I can't recommend this movie enough... it will definitely touch you every time you see it. :)"
5,The Passion of The Christ,"This is an absoulutely wonderful portrayal of the days before Jesus was crucified, I did not even mind reading the words on the bottom of the screen, you really seem to understand-best one ever!"
3,A gift,Bought this as a gift. The person bought for enjoys this movie. They requested this so I bought it for them.
2,"Great portrayal of the crucifixion, but way overdone!","Being raised Christian and learning about the Crucifixion was always something that was important to our family. The Passion of the Christ was a beautifully made movie(a least for the first 15 minutes), using Aramaic and great settings, that brought the story to life. Yet, the excessive blood and violence made the Passion something out of a Freddie Kruger movie. The more blood and gore that could be squeezed into every scene was done so. The movie is definitely not for anyone under 10 and will most likely disturb anyone over 10. My suggestion, rent it, it is not something that is worth watching a second time!"
5,Get yourself emotionally ready for this..,This movie was one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. I've only seen it once...and I think once is enough. The movie will bring you to tears. Watching this movie made me realize that Christ's death isn't someone just dying...but His death was an offering for our sins... this movie will definitely be life-changing...
5,"Incredible, powerful movie","Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ is an incredible, powerful movie. It affected everyone I know, myself included, that saw it. I've seen it twice, and I'll likely see it again. It's hard not to be moved by it, and it's definitely worthy of 5 out of 5 stars."
3,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:If you enjoy sadistic depictions of pain or feel that Christ's suffering the sentence of any common criminal was more important than his teachings than you may like this film; if you prefer not to see egregious use of slow-motion, ridiculous anachronistic jokes about tables, and 90 minutes of graphic torture than you may not."
5,The Passion of Your Life,"You will hate this movie. You will love this movie. You will weep for sorrow. You will weep for joy. You will feel shame at the torture and treatment He receives. You will feel reverent, grateful awe at the way He embraces His death. You will cringe and wish for the movie to be over many times, and then you will wish it would go on when He is risen and the final seconds of the film have ticked away. You will encourage everyone you know to see this film, yet you may doubt you'll be able to withstand viewing it again yourself. This is a once-in-an-eternity film. Life-changing, soul-reaching. Bravo, Mr. Gibson, for your faithfulness to this great work. And, viewer-if you feel none of the above when you experience The Passion of the Christ-check your pulse. You are already dead...and there is an empty tomb....."
3,Not what I expected,"The Passion of the Christ (Widescreen Edition) was good in terms of video and sound quality. But in the specification it said that ""spanish subtitles were included"". This is wrong. I ordered it twice as the people from Amazon suggested me to do qith a link they provided to me and again I received a DVD with NO SPANISH SUTITLES."
3,The Torture of Christ,"In Mel Gibson's depection of the crucifiction of Jesus, the viewer is subjected to an extremely gruesome and relentless torture sequence that spans almost the full 2 hours. ""The Passion of the Christ"" definitely makes the viewer understand the suffering endured as the viewer has to endure tension for over 2 hours w/ only brief flashbacks that show very little about the life of Jesus. This film does make some good points and is effective in making us realize what Jesus actually went through and his nature through out his persecution, but I don't think it hits the mark as a film for new/non Christians. If you are a Christian, seeing Buddah getting beaten for over 2 hours would serve little purpose in converting you to Buddhism. If you are a new Christian or are thinking about taking one w/ you to see this, make sure they understand the story of Jesus first as I don't think this would be viewed as a good movie from an unbiased non-religious viewpoint....."
1,BORING GORE FLICK THAT BEARS NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE BIBLE,"A lot of reviewers are writing reviews that read like novellas, so I am going to say it simply. Mel Gibson's movie would have been better named THE PASSION OF GORE & VIOLENCE. Ultra-violent to the extreme, it completely ignores WHO Jesus was. This is a movie for idiots.Go rent Halloween or Friday the 13th instead. At least they have plots."
2,Vivid but fictional,"This is an interested piece of work--definitely made with a lot of dedication and, well, passion for its subject. But people should be aware that Mel Gibson has based his vision on 19th century understandings about the life of Christ. After a hundred years of Jesus scholarship, we actually know more now about the circumstances of his life, including the politics, the religious background, etc., than we've ever known before. But Gibson ignores it all to present his own idiosyncratic conception (again, no pun intended). This is NOT the way it was. If it provokes viewers to learn more about the subject, that's the best we can say for the film."
1,The Passion of Mel Gibson,"The acting was fine, but I fail to see the point. We've got a guy with a thorny crown, covered with blood, hauling a cross. He falls down. Evil Roman soldiers beat him for falling down. He gets up and hauls it some more. He falls down again. They beat him again. Etc. I just don't understand why we need to see anyone, Jesus Christ or anybody else, taking such an ass kicking. What was it, 90 minutes out of 100? We need some more story here, Mel. I was glad when Jesus died so I could change the channel. Oh, there was a brief resurrection. Two seconds, sunlight through a hole in his hand, Michael resisting the urge to make a horrible joke about eating M&Ms this close to Easter Sunday."
3,This movie reflects religion in today's political climate,"The twenty minute whipping scene grossed me out. Stop; rewind; return to the video store. I prefer to remember Jesus by the way he LIVED, rather than the manner in which he DIED. It is not just a little morbid that people dwell upon the crucifixion - a Pagan punishment.When I was going to Sunday school, they taught us about the good deeds Christ performed, and didn't focus on the whipping, blood, guts, nails etc. But nowadays ""religiosity"" passes for true compassion and people shout about their religion like a tribal identity - and hate all the other tribes. It's about belonging ""to"" a big organization, rather than a personal philosophy. People want to be a part of something bigger than themselves.This movie will appeal to those with a sado-masochistic sexuality."
1,Intended to produce hatred of Jews,"This movie sounded like it might be good but all it ever did was promote raw hatred of Jews, nothing about the positives of having a spiritual relationship. They beat, stomped, kicked, stabbed, whipped, thirsted, and abused Christ until you couldnt stand watching it another minute, then they would do it ten more minutes. After about the sixth session of that same scenario you'd rather just walk out than to continue to sit through another beating. That's what the whole movie was about, more beating, hanging, dragging, etc."
2,Emphasizes wrong thing,I just thought this movie was bloody and violent. That's it. The Last Temptation is so much better. I forget the director's name but see that movie instead. I am sure you can find it on video.
2,A religious splatter film,Anyone who's faith is strengthened by such a brutally violent movie needs to rethink about their faith. This movie teaches little if anything about the life and teachings of Jesus. It is nothing more then a 2 hour movie about medievil torture tactics.Mel should have focused more on Jesus' life rather then His death.
4,squeamish truth,"I don't believe any mortal could endure this amount of torture , but then again if Jesus was really here to accomplish the true freedom of mans spirit over satan and is the son of God , this is exactly the sacrifice that was called for . Mel thank you !!!"
1,A Loser,"It was a bummer finding myself looking at subtitles. I also did not experience in the fervent passion and zeal that the movie was supposedly causing.I think the hype is a bit much for the product.I'd advise you not to have ""treats"" or a meal as you watch this movie. We need to remember that Caligula was mad for eating and watching gore at the same time. This movie is pure ancient Roman gore. This can't be too far of a cry from what Caligula enjoyed watching as he sat in his personal home eating and munching.A decent parent would never allow their child to see this movie. It is the stuff Caligula had watched as a child and we know how he turned out. It's unnerving to think of how many ""Boots"" sat out in those movie theaters, and how many are now sitting in the livingroom with ""mummsy and dahdah."" I mean we're talking graphic angles of torture devices on the skin as never before seen etc."
4,Jesus Christ is still king and my LORD !!,"This was a very good and powerful movie! I cried when Jesus was crucified, and I'm not the teary guy when it comes to movies. I just wish it had more character development of Jesus' disciples and the healings Jesus did.Overall, I thought it was spiritually-moving. I think this will be the only masterpiece for many generations!"
1,Masterpiece for Torture,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! It was nothing but a bloodbath, worse than the most VIOLENT mobster movies out there. I thought ""Reservoir Dogs"" or ""Goodfellas"" were fairly violent, gruesome movies, but those mobster films look like children plays next to this one! It amazes me that this trash can be called a ""masterpiece""..."
4,Great Spinning Compost Bin,"For about 5 years I have filled my composter with lawn clippings and kitchen vegetable matter. This bin is made of very thick and durable plastic which spins about a axle thru the middle of the barrel. The base is a metal tubular frame that supports the axle. The barrel clears the ground by several inches, allowing the composted material to be poured (or scraped) out of the barrel onto the ground. It is designed for bulk composting. The lid may be twisted a quarter turn to open the barrel. To get started, I recommend adding a shovel full of dirt from your yard plus any available earth worms along with vegatable matter. Once it starts 'cooking', the vegatable matters breaks down quickly (3-4 weeks). I like this composter so much, I am giving one to my son."
3,Not the best in the series,"This book from the Grijpstra/de Gier series has the three protagonists reluctantly researching the theft of the load of an oil tanker. Reluctantly, because their clients - a multimillionaire father and son team - have threatened them with the tax man and with various other means, before the three accept. Once they do accept, the events happen mostly in Key West and various parts of the Caribbean.I tried to like this book a lot, after all I tremendously enjoyed most of the other novels from this series, but I started losing interest after the first half of the book. I did finish the book, but I had less pleasure reading it than all the other ones in the series."
5,what a tenor player,"It's been rare that I wanted to have an album so badly after listening to a one minute sample. But listen to Jerry Bergonzi's solo on 'Cassandra' and you'll probably know why ... at least if you're a tenor player. And the rest is just as good. I never even particularly liked Brubeck's music, but I very particularly love this one!"
4,a star's lifetime,"What happens in the lifetime of a star? This basically is the subject of the book. It describes from basic physical principles where ever possible how a star is formed and how it burns. Kippenhahn shows how inside a star, the gravitational pressure is necessarily balanced by the outgoing radiation and matter pressure.We see the cycle of how a star burns its hydrogen, synthesising helium in the process. Then, how heavier elements are formed. Finally, whether a star novas or not, depending on its mass.The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is shown as a concise way to describe the lifecycle trajectory of a star, over billions of years.Well suited for physics students."
3,Pages coming off,"It arrived to me in Italy 20-15 days before the standard international shipping's time, in perfect conditions, as bought from the bookshop. Few days later the first page came off."
5,One of Gardner's Classics,"If any of you that are into Gardner's tradition, then this book should be on your shelf. Eventhough, you can see that the book is fiction, this is where it all started by promoting ""wicca"" into the modern age and telling others that it is here to stay. I found it very interesting when he talked about his recarnation and how his dreams where messages sent to him by the touch of the Goddess. Remember, that his life work should be greatful towards those who talk about his work, without him, none of the traditions that you know of as of now, would have been born today without Gardner, so, give where credit is due."
1,Publishing House comments,"I was really happy to find a copy of this book and my comments have NOTHING to do with the work itself. However, I am not happy with the quality of the volume itself from Goldolphin House. The book arrived yesterday and I have read only about 30 pages, and the book is already falling apart. Pages are coming loose from the binding. The text is not justified and is ragged on the Right Side of the pages. This is a minor point to some, but I find it very distracting. I just think for the price, a book should not be falling apart and the text should be properly formatted. The quality of this volume is as if they printed it at home, using substandard word processing software, and glued it together using discounted paste."
3,"the lonely ""Fly""","Mr. Mister stopped on music of ""fatha"" design; Broken Wings is the soundtrack of a generation. The 80's leave their hearts on broken wings and sometimes, when you listen this track, you can imagine - what's going on? - a band of one music only? A mistake or a divine inspiration? MAke your choice....."
1,A Forgetful Album - Fortunately!,"I heard a recording of a song called ""Broken Wings."" It was a beautiful religious-type song. I heard it on the radio and, looking it up on the web, this album was the only reference I found to ""Broken Wings."" I endured one listen and looked around the room for some sharp object with which I could puncture my eardrums. Fortunately, nothing immediately came to hand and my hearing lives on to hear other material. Forget this group and this album (I found that easy to do!). If you ever hear the ""Broken Wings"" thing I wanted, please be in touch."
4,"This is the UK release, with 2 different tracks to the US release","The blue and white beams on the cover, instead of yellow and green beams, and the fact this is an Import give away that this is the UK release of the CD instead of the US release, so Track 5 is The Exact Colour, not Nimos & Tambos, and Track 8 is Twyncyn/Trembling Willows, not Arrival/The Intention Craft. A bit academic, really, because all these tracks are excellent, melodic alt rock. The music sounds like a mixture of Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree, The Beach Boys, Nirvana and Opeth. Some gorgeous harmonies from the male singers and the female singer, coupled with catchy melodies and some mellow tracks which rock-up sometimes. The lyrics make no sense, but sound good anyway. An interesting new sound (they even use some violin) which could well leave you hooked. Recommended."
5,Progressive Music At It's Finest!!,"The ""Dark Third"" represents one of the finest progressive releases of the year. Pure Reason Revolution is a band that's going places and I strongly suggest you board their train now!!With a sound that likens to Porcupine Tree and Pineapple Thief, the ""Dark Third"" is loaded with well-crafted songs full of vocal harmonies, musical soundscapes, and excellent production. This isn't metal, prog, or whatever genre you wish to pick, but a composite of styles, thus ""progressive"" in the truest sense. Buy, listen, and enjoy this debut release!! An excellent recording from a very promising band!!!!! You will not be disappointed."
3,I hope and pray they will remaster this...,"LOVE the music, but the CD I have sounds like it was recorded in 4-bit (or worse). Almost unlistenable. And that's too bad, because when they really let loose on Bight Ambassadors of Morning, it could really crack the foundations of your home if only it didn't sound like pure crap from the distorted mastering. Rated 3 stars only because of the sound quality. The music itself is absolutely wonderful."
4,"Great Story, Terrible Editing","I loved this book but am giving it only 4 stars because the editing was so awful in this Kindle edition.There were so many spelling and grammatical errors that it got insulting to me after a while. With that said, the story line was a bit predictable at times, but all in all a very enjoyable book. The story is about a rock group whose popularity spans from the 60's to the 90's. I found myself trying to figure out which group this story reminded me of... possibly Aerosmith?"
4,Just Plain Old EXCELLENT,"Nora Roberts can really set up a tale. Spare, and not suffering from chains of adjectives or adverbs, Nora has me hyperventilating and crying all at the same time, finding it almost impossible to read on. She describes people and places perfectly, not too much, and just enough. Her character development is full and bleeds. Her stories are realistic and well-researched. Her plot and structure elements are as precise as a metronome.I recommend this book."
5,Awesome,"This was one of the first Nora books I read, after my first read I have not been able to put her down. I found a box of Harlequin romance novels at a garage sale about the same year this came out, and purchased the whole box. Little did I know it was all Nora Roberts so I have luckily read almost every book she has written as Nora Roberts. She is always fantastic. If it is mindless romance or intense suspense she's magic with words."
4,loved it and hated it but still 4 stars,"My husband gave me this book for Christmas knowing I like Nora Roberts but I was hesitant. This book was much different from what I expected. It took place over 3 decades and had some pretty dark things going on with the characters. I loved the character Emma and that her Dad was a famous rock star, I think that made the book. Even though there were sad dark things I couldn't put the book down. It made me cry, laugh, be sad and smile so I guess it covered all emotions for a book. I have reread this book several times and love the whole story. Its a very well written put together story. I hope you read it"
5,Wonderful!!! Great Suspense,This book was by far the best I have read so far. It was my first Nora Roberts and I'm anxious to read another soon! These characters in this book just kept you thinking and living right along with them. I loved it!!!
5,"Excellent book, by far one of her best.","I've read quite a few books in the past year, I can say this.....Nora Roberts has been one of my favorite authors since I read ""Divine Evil"". ""Public Secrets"" had me totally intrigued. She tugs at your heart strings and doesn't let go. I found myself crying twice, (and it's not really a love story, it's suspense! Read this book!"
1,public secrets,This was obviously one of her earlier works. I hated this book. I am never going to read another early work again. I love her later books and can't wait for new books to hit the shelves. This was painful. The characters had no insight into eachother it was all superficial and the main character was a fluffy dummy who was supposed to be strong.
2,A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT,"I expect something Nora Roberts writes, and I pay to read, to have been edited. This Kindle edition may be different, but it had so many errors in it I was distracted and irritated. On top of that, I thought the storyline was good but then the ending was very disappointing and, to me, insulting to her readers in the way the main bad guy/gal - a supposedly intelligent person throughout the book - suddenly turns into an idiot in the attempt to dispatch the main character. I got the feeling that after what I felt was an overly long but basically good story, Nora ran out of creativity in ending the tale. (I've tried to avoid any spoiler here on the ending for those who want to read this book.)"
5,Just Brilliant!!!,"It's funny how fate steps in isn't it? Until recently I had never picked up a Nora Roberts book. Public Secrets was given to me as a gift, by a good friend, and I am forever gratful.I have never read a more powerful book in my life. It is the kind of book that you come across once every five years.Emma is a strong character. You see her grow from a tiny, scared child into a strong, independant woman that any parent would be proud of.Emma has to overcome a lot. But as they say, what doesn't kill us, only makes us stronger.This book is fantastic and I suggest that everyone read it.Nora Roberts is an insperation to aspiring writers like myself."
3,Good Read,"I really enjoyed this book, it was a good suspense story that kept you entertained. I have read a lot of her books, she writes a good story."
1,Republish an old 1990 novel,Seems to me - just another way for her to make more money. Republish a boodk from the 1990's as a new release. Greed for money.
3,public secrets,"This novel is good, but not excellent, as is Carolina Moon, River's End, and some of Nora Robert's romantic thrillers."
4,"Not one of Nora's best, but an OK read","It was a little slow getting into this book, might be because it spanded many years before coming to the conclusion. It also dealt with some dark topics such as drug use which it not typically Nora's style, however because of the book centering around a rock star family I gues that's to be expected. Overall, by the end of the book, everything did come together nicely and I was happy I read it. It just was a little more difficult for me to get into the book and took me a good week to read. Normally I usually read a book in 2-3 days."
1,Boring!,"I am 200 pages into a 500 page book. I just cannot get up any enthusiasum for the book, the story or characters. The beginning of the book was pretty interesting. Abused little girl swept away to live with famous rocker Dad. Then adored baby brother is murdered. Then nothing! The plot comes to a screeching halt while the lead character finishes school & moves out of Daddy's house. I am bored to tears with this book. Watching paint dry would be more entertaining!"
