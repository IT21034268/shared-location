4,Micro Bead Therapy Pillow,"So far, the pillow is great! It took about 2 weeks to break in (it was kind of firm). I am not using the cover with it, just regular pillow cases. I like that you can form it where you need to. It has great support for my neck. -- My cat likes it too, and has been trying to push my head off of it at night. So far, we've been able to share! If it were a little cheaper, I would buy her one too! --"
3,Cover too small for pillow,I know why they made the case smaller. So that over time the pillow would not lose it's shape. It is a very comfortable pillow without the provided case. I put a pillow protector over it and a regular pillow case. Much better... Now my daughter wants one... but I have finished my Christmas shopping.
2,Very Firm,Was looking for a nice pillow that would give good support but this pillow is just very very firm when you first get it and hasn't loosened up much after a couple months of me trying to lay on it at odd times to loosen it up.
1,A LEAKING MESS,"I was really looking forward to this pillow, I have heard good things from my friends about them. First night was a bit odd, the pillow is very firm and takes some getting used to. I could also feel little beads under the cover, between the pillow and the cover. During the second night I could feel there were more little beads under the pillow case. I looked to see what was going on in the middle of the night, the pillow was leaking beads at an end seam. This is like a bean bag leak but the beads very small. So, after two nights this thing goes back and I clean up the beads. I am disappointed as the pillow itself felt good, but this is a mess. I am opting for a refund of the product and shipping. I don't think I want to roll the dice on a replacement, I'll find something else."
1,Still a pain in my neck...,"I suffered terrible whiplash back in 1997 in an auto accident and have struggled for years with neck pain. After much searching I found the most relief I have ever felt. I began sleeping with a horse-shoe-shaped neck roll filled with bean-bag-chair-like stuffing purchased in an airport gift shop.When I spotted this pillow it seemed to be made out of basically the same materials... so I ordered it. I admit I was quite the skeptic... So when I received this I hung onto the packaging; ""just in case""... one month turned into 2, then 3... I threw the packaging away ...You may have noticed that this was a 1 star review so here goes... I purchased this pillow in May of 2009... I am writing this review in October of 2009. I have had this pillow for only 5 short months and already it is worn out! It flattens when I place it under my neck and I wake up all night long chasing it around my bed. I am going back to the $12 neck roll from the airport! Don't waste your money... I did!!"
4,not a pain in the neck! (usually),This pillow is pretty good-the only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that I purchased 3 of them and one of them is much softer than the others. The pillow is fairly firm but not stiff. I recommend the pillow for side sleepers. I was waking up with neck pain daily and that is not happening with this pillow.
3,PIKE STREET MICRO BEAD THERAPY PILLOW W/COVER,"The micro beads were exactly what I wanted except for the firmness. It was harder than I expected, I really wanted a travel pillow softness. My preference....I could transfer the present quantity into a bigger casing and easily come up with a softer ""sleep upon."" I have to say it is wonderful."
4,Good quality but a little to firm.,"Although this pillow is a micro bead pillow it is extremely firm. I can't get my head to sink into it without first using my hands to make an indentation. I don't wake up with back, or neck pains anymore since switching to this pillow though so it must be doing something right. I could not imagine buying this at full price but at the sale price i got it for it was worth it. It just takes a minute to get situated comfortably before sleeping."
1,Loves me like a rock,"The pillow arrived in a box with flimsy plastic protective packaging that didn't cover the merchandise.The pillow had a strong chemical odor. The odor hadn't subsided any after three days of airing.The pillow was about as comfortable as a concrete slab would be. It had almost no 'give,' even two hours after my head rested on it. It didn't stretch a bit. I used it without its cover (which supposedly makes it too firm for some users) and with a simple (and ample) pillowcase, which should have allowed it to stretch out. As far as molding to my head, it didn't mold at all.If you want a hard---and I do mean hard---pillow, this is for you. It will definitely support your head, because it has no 'give' to it. It MIGHT become more comfortable after a few nights of use, but I don't want to invest three or four nights of sleeplessness to find out. Your mileage may vary."
2,Very Hard,This pillow is very hard. There isn't enough room inside the cover to manipulate the beads into a comfortable position.
2,Hard Stuff,"i have been using a memory foam pillow for a few years but tried these for a change of pace. My husband likes his... it stays firm so he can prop his head up to watch tv better. It is extremely stiff and I can not get comfy enough with this pillow to sleep. Looks fluffy by photo but this is not a fluffy, cuddly type of pillow. I toss it to the ground every night... and use my old memory foam pillow. Right after getting the pillows my daughter quickly jumped on the bed to swoosh her head on the pillow and actually said... ouch.. lol"
2,Not as Comfortable as I Expected,"I purchased this pillow anticipating that it would provide more of a cradling effect for my head. However, I feel that some adjustments need to be made to the pillow to either remove some of the filler beads and/or provide a looser fitting pillow liner that would lend itself to easier and better contouring and crading of the head."
2,Not what I had expected,"I was expecting this pillow to be more comfortable than it is. It feels like my head is on a rock when I use it. It's not soft in the least bit. It's supportive, but I wouldn't say it's comfortable."
1,Like sleeping on granite,"It was very, very, very firm. Firm like a rock. Tried really hard to snuggle down into the microbeads, but it just was not very giving. I could not get comfortable and woke up at 4am with a splitting headache and a very sore neck and shoulder.Returned it the next day."
1,Hard and Hot,"Bought this pillow because it is supposed to keep your head cool (compared to other types of pillows). This pillow becomes much hotter than regular pillows and requires me to flip the pillow to its opposite side much more often than standard pillows. This pillow is also very hard. Initially when you place your head on it, it does a good job of forming to the correct shape for support, but once it is set it feels almost rock hard. Definitely would not recommend."
1,Too hard,These pillows were too hard due to being over stuffed. I tried to not use the pillow case but still too uncomfortable. Had to return them!
2,Like a brick,"I bought this on suggestion and it wasn't what I had expected. The one I ""test slept"" was cushy and nice. This one is super firm. I would say it was like sleeping on a brick instead of a pillow of beads. Honestly I gave up on it after a few nights."
3,"May be good for some, but not for us","This pillow is weird. It feels nice and soft to the touch, with or without the cover. If it only felt as good on our heads as it did to our hands we would keep it. The first thing that bothered both my wife and I was the feel of the contours. No matter how we positioned it there was always a gap somewhere between our heads and the pillow. It's something we just can't get used to. I will attribute this to using ""normal"" pillows our whole lives. The second issue was the hardness. It doesn't seem like it would be hard when holding it, but when laying on it I felt like there was some sort of board underneath. Too bad as I was looking forward to using this product. I'm sure it will be great for others, but it's just not for us."
1,Like a brick,"This pillow is as hard as a brick with or without the pillow case.I grant you that I haven't been able to find an ideal pillow, but the newfangled types of pillows always seem to be even worse than cheap polyester pillows."
4,Relief for neck pain!,Micro Bead Pillow: For the price it is a great buy. Wish it was a little thicker. Took some getting use to because firmer than I expected. After a couple of nights I got use to it. I've had neck pain for years and this pillow does the trick. Great support and I don't wake up with neck pain or headache! Would recommend it for anyone who experiences neck problems!!
1,The worst pillow I have ever owned,"This is by far the worst pillow I have ever had the displeasure of owning. I read some of the reviews and was really looking forward to finally having a good nights sleep. This pillow is like sleeping on packed down sand. It is so hard and uncomfortable my neck and shoulder actually hurt more the next day.I will be sending it back immediately. P.S. the first pillow that arrived had a broken zipper on the cover, I should have taken that as a sign. If you want a good nights sleep - DO NOT BUY THIS PILLOW!!!"
1,"Noxious, literally!","I had been using the Tony Little micro bead pillow which I love. It wore out and I couldn't get it any longer on Amazon. So, I saw this ""comparable"" pillow in structure and content. Or so I thought. When I opened the box, I noticed a strong chemical smell. When I opened the plastic bag it shipped in, it stunk so badly, I crammed it right back into the bag. My eyes watered, throat burned and I got an instant headache with nausea. The noxious fumes coming from the pillow are unbearable. I put it back in the box and set in the garage until I could return it. When I went into the garage the next day, the whole garage stunk. These cannot be healthy fumes. And, when you think about your nose being that close to the pillow all night...and your brain...what is it that you're breathing in?!?!Went back to the Tony Little micro bead pillow. Yes, it only lasts about 6-8 months but at least I'm not inhaling toxic, carcinogenic chemicals and fumes.Sorry - bad product."
1,Could not have my head on this pillow for more than a minute or so,"I couldn't wait for my head to sink into the microbeads on this pillow when I took it out of the box. Firstly, it sat in the spare room for a couple of days as it smelled horrible (I'm guessing it's the smell of the new microbeads) but when I did put it on the bed I could not have my head on it for more than a minute or so. For me, it was akin to sleeping on a brick! My head didn't 'sink' into it at all.The most galling thing about the whole process (and internet shopping in general)... having to pay to send it back and be left with nothing."
5,Pleased buyer,"I have purchased three (3 ) of these pillows and a 4th for a friend. Love them, excellent for cervical neck or back problems. Releaves numbness in arms, hands and neck pain while sleeping. It has been dreamy sleeping on these pillows. Won't travel without one; won't leave them behind. Recommend this pillow to everyone."
2,Too thin for side sleepers,"I've tried this pillow for several nights now, and haven't has a good night's rest yet. This morning I woke up with the right side of my face numb in addition to my neck and shoulder aching. The problem is that the beads need to bunched up to make it thick enough to support your neck, but that makes it very hard too, so the tendency is to attempt to readjust it throughout the night. It might be OK for back-sleepers, but I'm relegating it to the trash."
3,IT'S OK,"I ORDERED A TONY LITTLE MICROPEDIC PILLOWS FROM HSN AND MY SISTER CAME TO VISIT ME AND SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH MY PILLOWS, SO I DECIDED TO LOOK ON AMAZON TO SEE IF THE PILLOWS WERE CHEAPER. WELL WE FOUND THE PILLOWS BUT BY THE TIME SHE RECIEVED THE PILLOWS THEY WERE NOT THE STANDARD SIZE PILLOWS THEY ARE LIKE TRAVELING SIZE PILLOWS, THEY WERE REALLY SMALL AND NOT AS COMFORTABLE AS THE PILLOWS I HAVE BUT SHE KEPT THEM ANYWAY......"
2,HARD AS A ROCK! DON'T USE THE PILLOWCASE,"HARD AS A ROCK! The only way for this pillow to be somewhat comfortable is to not have any pillow case on it at all. A regular pillow case is a LITTLE better than the provided one, but still very hard. I used it without any case and did fine except I could smell the pillow. I even let the pillow air out in our garage for a week before trying it."
5,very good remove the cover,"very good when removed cover.first it come, Not comf. I saw someone suggest remove cover. I did. good idea. now it perfect."
5,Best pillow ever!,I am in love with my new pillow. I finally found what I was looking for. Going to buy another one for back up!
1,I got ripped off!!!,I ordered and paid for a new pillow. I got it and the bag inside the box was ripped open and the pillow cover was just thrown in the bag. The cover was dirty and had grease all over it and it smelled. This was USED and I ordered a NEW pillow. I will never ever order from this seller again. Very disapointed.
2,What a headache...,"This pillow is so packed its impossible to sleep on. I tried it one night and had a neck creak. Cannot sleep on it any longer. Whilst I am not saying it may not be good for people that like hard pillows, it's just was too packed 'hard' for me."
3,its too hard,at first i liked it. then soon i cant really fall asleep easily. i guess it is work in someday! but should get a regular pillow as well
4,Good enough,"Comparing the price for what you get I found it fair. At first it's too hard if you have it in it's cover so I used it without the cover for the first 1-2 months. Then I put it in the cover and so far feels good. As the time passes is getting softer and I don't know how it's gonna be after one year or more, since I have it for only 3-4 months."
1,Don't use this in a pillow fight!,I received this pillow as a gift because I accidentally added it to my wish list. It can not be returned so figured I would give it a try. BAD IDEA! This pillow is hard and was not comfortable at all. I even tried removing the pillow case it comes with and it felt just as hard and uncomfortable! If used in a pillow fight you will probably knock someones teeth out! Pass on this one..
2,Extremely hard,this pillow is not for the faint of heart. 20 years in the Marine Corps may not even condition a person well enough to sleep on a pillow this hard. Seriously it feels like your head is laying on a cement block. If you like extraordinarily firm pillows it will be great. if not stay away.
4,Pinzon Basics Micro Bead Pillow,"I think this pillow is top quality and is packed full with the microbeads. Maybe a little too full. The pillow is too hard really because the beads can't move around. I do like to use it for sitting up in bed but not for sleeping. I have not noticed the beads escaping like I read in some of the other reviews. I think it's a great pillow, just not what I was expecting. I was expecting something more like the cheap version you buy at novelty stores or Walmart. Would I recommend? Yes, for someone who needs a very firm, thick pillow it is excellent."
3,pinzon pillow,Very hard. Hurts my ears. Still looking for a pillow that is soft enough and doesn't loose its beads. Maybe I will get use to it.
3,Microbeeds are a nice change. Needs more fluff,"This pillow can be great if only it had twice as much ""fluff"" than it already has. I get pain in my shoulders and i've noticed that much of it stems from my pillow (effecting how i sleep). While this pillow helped, I find my head sinks nearly flush with the bed after sleeping on it too long (no good). I'm piling it on top of one of my older pillows now for added cushion and now i'm sleeping pretty."
5,Great for neck problem people,I have a lot of neck problems and my pillow makes a big difference in how I feel the next day. The only thing I did different with this pillow is I took it out of the pillowcase that was sent with the pillow and put it in a king size pillowcase so that the microbeads could be dispersed more. This helps the pillow to conform better to my neck and head. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
4,Not what I thought,The pillow is comfortable but it was not what I was expecting it to be. The pillow molds to you if you adjust it by giving it a good punch. It can be a bit tough under the neck but I've found it more comfortable as a side pillow (head to arms) or back pillow (to sit up). Trying to sleep with it under your neck does not give the proper contour and comfort and I wake up with neck stiffness everytime. I also bought the water filled pillow which I believe is more comfortable under your neck.
3,Too full for petite person,"Too many beads for a petite person, I think. I woke up with serious neck crimps for consecutive nights. I had to perform surgery on each section individually, causing a snowstorm of staticky beads to stick to everything including the cats, and now it's sufficiently comfortable."
1,Like sleeping on a brick,"This pillow is wayyyy to firm for me. It has very little give. I've even tried to give it to friends and the consensus is... ""No Way"""
2,It's very hard like a piece of wood,"I normally like the soft pillows so this one did not work for me. My neck and head actually start hurting after using the pillow for a few min. It's so hard! feels like it's been filled with sands. Well, it's about $7 return shipment so am going to use it as back support for sitting now!"
3,Pillow not for me,"I tried the pillow, it seems well made but I found it to be way too firm. After a night's sleep my neck was really sore."
3,Very Firm,"If you're looking for a firm pillow, this is the one for you. My husband loves these pillows...I do not. That's why I gave it a 3 star rating. If you remove the zippered cover it makes the pillow a bit softer, but not pliable enough for me. We've had our about a year now and it looks and feels like new. It doesn't lose it's shape at all."
1,Like resting your head on a bag of cement.,"I'm not even trying to be funny. I read about these micro bead pillows and it sounded interesting. So I ordered it and tried to sleep on it and it was too hard by a long shot. It is even too hard to sit on, never mind rest your head on. If you are looking for something with absolutely zero give then this might be for you. Not even suitable for camping."
1,very disappointed,I've been looking for the perfect pillow for months now. I have a pinched nerve and herniated disk in my neck. I spend a lot of time tossing and turning. I use a squishy microbead pillow to provide some support and I hoped this would do the trick throughout the night. Unfortunately it was so packed with beads it doesn't give enough to cradle my neck and head. It's terribly stiff and hard and I haven't even put on the cover. I'll be returning this and continue searching for the right pillow.
3,It Didn't Help Me,"I've been suffering from some pretty brutal head, neck, and shoulder aches for about six months. My chiropractor advised me to stop sleeping on my stomach which has helped to an extent. My next step was a new pillow. I bought this in hopes it would give me support and do the trick for my pains. I've tried it with and without the cover and have to say this pillow did nothing but provide me with an uncomfortable night sleep. I have since found a pillow to help me, actually one I ordered to help me from rolling onto my stomach and sleeping the night away. I now use this pillow to keep me from rolling off my side."
4,Pike Street Micro Bead Pillow: Excellent. Cover: Very bad.,"The pillow iself is excellent--cushy but resilient, completely as advertized. However, the cover that comes with it is much too small. It fits so snugly that it turns the cushy, resilient pillow into a hard cushion--something you might want to sit on, but not rest your head on. I made myself a nice loose cover out of an old flannel sheet, allowing the pillow enough room to ""give"" when I put my head on it, and that solved the problem. Now it's perfect."
1,It leaked beads all over my bedroom,I got this pillow and figured I'd give it a shot. First off the thing is horribly hard. I've had it for awhile and it just sits on the floor because I can't sleep on it. If you want a mircofill pillow you can pick one up from Walgreens for about $6.00. Those are better to sleep on.On morning I noticed that the cover felt weird so I opened it up and there were beads everywhere. I put the cover on like it said but there was a small hole in the side. This thing leaked beads all over my bedroom. I had to sew the pillow back up with some heavy thread and it worked. I then spent 30 minutes vacuuming up beads.This thing is not worth the money when you can get the same thing at other stores for under $10.
3,not bad,"started out alot harder than i thought. after a month now much more comfortable and better support. It's not what i thought it would be, but better than a standard pillow. still trying to decide if i liked my foam contour pillow better or this one. If it breaks down much more ill go back to the foam."
5,Best pillow I've used,"After 1 year of daily use, I can claim that this is the best pillow I have used ever! Very comfortable, and durable. Pillow cover that comes along with it is useless though."
3,Still Goes Flat,"This is an over-priced bed pillow. Like most bed pillows, whether less or more expensive, it still goes flat and doesn't really offer any special support. If you do buy it, don't use the cover that comes with it. It is a nice cover but compresses the pillow too much.No real value here."
3,Pillow was too thick--just not comfortable for me,Sorry to say I can't use it. I'm keeping it for guests. Anyone who likes a thicker pillow would probably like it. I liked the micro beads. It would have been great if it wasn't so thick.
5,Love this pillow.,Love this pillow. It's firm enough that you head just doesn't sink in and holds it's shape. Great price too. Would recommend to anyone.
3,Okay,"After some use the beads are no longer as plump as they once were, so the pillow is not as firm. If you don't like the firmness of the new pillow, leave the cover off of it. When using a regular pillowcase, the beads can spread out a little more. However, when using a regular pillowcase, it is VERY difficult to keep this pillow in the pillowcase. It tends to scoot out every night! I ordered it for myself but found out I prefer a waterbase pillow due to a neck injury. However, my husband started using it (when I rejected it) and he loves it! Just goes to prove pillows are a very personal preference!!"
3,too high...,Too high...You get used to it and then get pain when using any other...Wouldn't buy another one.Adding words to complete the minimum of 20.
1,OMG the smell!,"I should have listened to the person who indicated this pillow was a bit odiferous. Seller was excellent in getting product to me, but it cannot be used by someone with adrenal stress or chemical sensitivities because the smell is overwhelming. Wasn't cost effective to return it. It has been hanging outside for a couple weeks to try to air it out. Airing has helped but it is going to take a long while to make it useable."
4,Slept better in a couple nights!,"If you buy this pillow, have some patience. At first, it seems hard and you'll think you made a mistake. After 2 nights you'll love it. I had neck surgery a couple years ago and woke up with pain almost every day with my old pillow. I have very little or no pain now. It also keeps your head cooler. No more waking up with a wet pillow! I would recommend going with at least the queen size. A queen is about the same size as a standard regular pillow."
1,smell can't use,"I read the reviews for this pillow before purchasing and noticed that someone had mentioned the strong chemical smell, but I had no idea just how bad it would be.cAN'T USE IT!!!"
3,"Soft, moldable but smell is bad","I like the pillow's shape. The feel is so very soft. I love the pillow when not used with the provided outter cover. It makes the pillow stiff, and almost hard. Without the outter cover, it is very soft, and doesn't pill or snag. The only problem is, it smells. The smell is very strong. It smells kinda like melted plastic. And I have tried to air it out, but no success. If anyone out there can help me with that smell, I would appreciate it. Because without that, I would love it."
3,Micro Bead Pillow too soft for me,"I've suffered from the effects of neck injuries for years and was trying to find a new pillow that didn't go flat like foam pillows do. I read the reviews on this pillow and thought I would give it a try. I first tried it without the pillow case that came with it, and used my own pillow case. The next night I put it in the pillowcase thinking it would constrict the beads in the pillow making it firmer. Unfortunately for my neck, I found this pillow too soft. I was waking up throughout the night and trying to make it firm under my neck to give me more neck support. By the 5th night I knew I couldn't sleep on the pillow any more and I had to return it. I've since shifted to a round buckwheat pillow which gives my neck the support I need and helps keep the curve in my neck that I need to maintain."
3,Some disappointment,"Micro Bead Therapy Pillow with CoverI had certain health expectations for this pillow. I have a very comfortable,too small one, and needed the same head and neck comfort and relief.Feels great to the hands ,but it becomes very hard and rigid when lying head on it. The beads cannot shift for comfortable positioning. The cover was very nice but too small for the pillow thus severely restricting any possible bead shifting. If you like a firm pillow you might like this."
2,"Comfortable, but poor construction.","This pillow was, as expected, very comfortable for the price. My first night sleeping on it was pleasant and I did not wake up with discomfort in my neck or shoulders. Unfortunately, I also woke up to find that one of the seams in the pillow was poorly sealed and resulted in leaking thousands of 'microbeads' all over my bed. I will be returning this pillow for a refund and look for something else."
4,Micro Bead Therapy Pillow with Cover..,"I soon was hooked on micro bead pillows when they first came out. So I thought this would be a perfect pillow. In some ways, it is when you feel it with your hand, it feels like any micro bead pillow. I wasn't impressed with the cover although it is made out of soft velor. When the pillow is inside of the cover that it comes with, it makes the pillow too hard. For those people who enjoy an extra hard pillow, this is the pillow for you. I simply placed mine inside of a king sized pillow case. It is still very firm, but I sleep well on it. I have gotten used to the firmness of it. This isn't a soft, sink down into kind of pillow. This is a supporting pillow. Overall, yes I would buy this pillow again should something happen to mine. I am happy with it."
1,A Pain in the Neck!,"I bought this pillow hoping it would help my stiff neck and shoulders. Wrong! It is the most uncomfortable pillow I've ever tried--hard as a rock, stuffed with way too many beads. I don't return many items to Amazon, but this is definitely going back!"
1,"Oh, my achin' neck...","I recently had whiplash from an accident, and thought I'd try this pillow to support my neck. When I got it, it felt flexibly soft to the touch. Wrong! It was too full of beads and would not flex with changing head positions. It was like trying to sleep on a hard mass! Sent it back, and thanks, Amazon, for your great return policy."
2,just okay,"not that good, kinda stiff and not as fluffy as it looks. my neck was still stiff after i used this for about 3-4 days, actually it was more stiff."
2,Excellent the first month or two..,I've been using it for about 5 months and it feels way too soft now. The first 1 or 2 months of use was excellent and the support/firmness of the pillow was what I was looking for. Seems like I am back to square one on the search for the perfect pillow.
2,Pike Street Micro Bead Therapy Review,Smells bad and was full of flamable and non recycleable styrofoam. I didn't like it. I'd rather go for a memory foam pillow. Too expensive.
3,Too firm,"This is a very well-made pillow, and I want to love it. However, it is too firm for me. I can (barely) use it sleeping on my side, but sleeping on my back is OUT of the question with this pillow. (This is without the pillowcase, which makes it even more firm). I keep hoping that if I use it a lot, it will squish down, so I'm still hopeful!"
5,Micro Bead Therapy Pillow With Cover,"This is a great pillow, very comfy and adjusts easily to your neck. Have not had any problems with the beads falling out. Will definately buy another one next time I'm pillow shopping."
3,So far it's OK,"Before buying this pillow I looked at the reviews, saw both positive and negative reviews. I already have a small version with micro beads. I have to say this pillow has shown why it received the negative and positive reviews. If you fluff it up (as best you can), it is very soft - up to a point. My head sinks down in, but then it stops sinking, as if it hit a brick-like level. I am hoping the case will stretch, so the pillow will have more give (one reviewer said it does). But when you first get this pillow, especially if you do not try to fluff it up, it can seem very hard."
3,Pillow,Not real impressed and found I have a hard time getting comfortable. I went back to my old pillow but my husband loves his and uses it every night.
2,Great pillow if it didn't smell so bad.........,"I really liked the feel of this pillow and had hoped it would solve some of my sleeping issues with a comfortable pillow. However I couldn't stand the toxic smell coming from the pillow. Smelled like epoxy glue or airplane glue. I tried to air it out on the clothes line for several days, which didn't seem to help much either. Unfortunately the smell was keeping me awake even though the pillow was very comfortable.........so I've decided to get a down pillow now."
2,Not what I thought it was,"I bought a Homedics micro bead pillow at Alco a year or so ago. Have been searching for it again, but no luck. So ordered this pillow (2) although much more expensive than the one I have. This pillow seemed to be good quality, but is over-stuffed and hard compared to the one I have. Also, the slip cover that came with it was way too small for the pillow. Returned the pillows at an overall loss."
3,great,its very amazing and comfortable. I watch my movies laying down with the pillow on the wall with no problem. i sleep better than before. i'm givin it 3 stars because it came with a hole and it was letting the beads out. i just added tape to it. =[
2,Micro Bead Pillow,"I have lots of neck problems and I thought I would try the micro bead pillow, but it was way too firm for my neck."
2,Micro Bead Pillow,"This pillow is harder than I expected and is uncomfortable for sleeping. for the past 6-7 years I've slept on a water-filled pillow which I prefer. I wanted to try a different pillow and after reading the mostly positive reviews on Amazon about the Micro Bead,I decided to try it. I will continue to use it for now thinking it might loosen up a bit and conform more to my body. If it doesn't I will go back to the water filled pillow."
2,BEWARE OF STATIC ELACTRICITY,"The product is good and as described by many other customers, it feels perfect on bed. The pillow can curl around my head to maximize the contact area and there is no pain after sleep.The only problem is, as I just discovered a few days ago, the pillow causes static electricity. I think you can see sparkles at night if you scrub it. I know static electricity is not good for human body, so I am not sure if I should use it anymore.I hope the producer can give an evaluation on the effect of the static electricity the pillow causes on human health. Before that, I won't recommend this product."
2,Too hard for me,"Firmness of pillows is a matter of taste. The same can be said beds, and 1000 other things. De gustibus non est disputandum. For me this pillow is very firm. I normally sleep with down or down-alternative pillows. I slept (poorly) with this micro-bead pillow for one night and woke up with a stiff neck. It is going back to the Amazon mothership. Your mileage may vary."
2,Very hard and not comfortable,I do understand that the pillow will need to be firm for treatment of specific neck and spinal conditions. However this pillow is very hard and does not provide much opportunity to conform to ones preference. The description is correct that it holds it shape. It will most likely hold it shape since there is very little room to fluff the pillow. The product may be good for some but not for me.
2,HARD!!!,"I got this for my husband. This pillow is hard as a rock! I do believe when you put a pillow case on, it makes it so the beads can't move, my husband could not sleep on this pillow. So I took it, thinking I will take the pillow case off and use the pillow between my legs, it was still too hard! If you like rock hard pillows this is for you, if not, this is not for you. Even without the pillow case, this pillow is hard!!!"
2,SMELL is a big problem,"The biggest problem with this pillow was the smell - it was extremely strong. I tried several different things to get rid of it, I even washed it in my front loading washer, but nothing worked. It took several weeks and almost daily pillow case changes before the smell was tolerable to sleep with. Even after all that, I really wanted this pillow to help my neck pain, but it made it worse. This is basically a large version of the travel pillows with the beads in them that you buy at the airport. It may work for some people, but for me it was too hard and uncomfortable, and the ordeal of getting rid of the smell was not worth it."
2,not what expected,"This pillow is rock hard, there are so many micro beads in it that it will not conform or properly support (you can't even conform a fist into this pillow) any body part much less my head. It also has a strong nail polish remover smell that after 4 days of airing out has not gone away. very dissapointed, i have tried other micro bead pillows over the years and this is the hardest, stinkiest, most useless one yet."
4,Great pillow! Comfortable!,Great pillow! More comfortable than any other pillow I've used...better than memory foam! Great price and fast servicex We are very happy with it:)
1,Terrible!,"This pillow came with the case NOT on it. I tried it with the case and found it uncomfortable, so tried it without. It was just so-so. I tore off the label ... and the pillow tore,(Please note: I always tear off pillow labels and have never before had the pillow tear!)spewing tiny beads everywhere. Very difficlt to get up, like tiny styrofoam beads. I painstakingly sewed up the rip (I do not sew) and only then, when I went to toss the torn-off label, did I find a second label which had been sewn under the first label. There were dire warnings, ""Do not use pillow without case"",""If pillow tears do not inhale beads, if beads are inhaled get medical help immediately ..."" Wow. I have returned the pillow."
1,Hard as a rock,Really disappointed with this pillow! I slept OK (not great) for the first two or three nights but after that it felt like I was sleeping on a rock! Rocks would have been cheaper...
4,Better than I thought,"I purchased these therapy pillows with reservation. I have had neck and back painfor over 35 years and have gone the gambit of purchases that have proven inadequate.However, after having them for a month now, I must admit that these pillows have alleviated the neck pain. Great guns!!!!!! Something that really works......I am a happy camper."
4,therapy pillow,"this pillow is very differant from other pillows that i have had, i really think i sleep better.it is a quality pillow, good purchase."
1,Microbead Mess,"If you want to vacuum micro beads off your bed on a daily basis, this pillow is for you. I have micro beads in my bed every morning."
4,pillow is good,"The pillow itself is good, the cover does not let the pillow adjust to the person easily. I use the pillow without the cover and it is great for sleeping on."
2,Micro Bead Pillow,"This pillow came highly recommended from several people. After a pinched nerve, and the discovery of some bulging disk's in my neck, I decided I needed a good therapy pillow. Although I've not had any neck discomfort, I have found the pillow very uncomfortable to sleep on. I have given it a few weeks, but have moved on to another 'therapy' pillow that is designed differently. The micro bead pillow to me feels like a bag filled with sand and cement. As with everything, nothing works for everyone. I know there are those that this pillow is a perfect fit(my son and his wife are two of them), but this pillow is not for me."
1,Worst Pillow Ever,"I bought this when it was $80, but even at $25 I wouldn't waste money on it.It won't hold shape, provides no support and it STINKS like some god awful chemical. Even after 9 months the smell remains.Wondering why the positive reviews even exist..unless the quality went down since they left them."
2,Hard as a rock!,"Was excited to try this pillow... I will say that the quality is great but the pillow is hard as a rock! It is very difficult to shape it and appeares to be too thick. I tried to use it but quickly gave up after 15 minutes, will make covers for the and use as seat cushions for outdoor events."
1,Like a bag of cement,"I really tried to like this pillow and used it for a month. If you use the pillow case it comes with it really is like a bag of cement. You have to use a looser pillow case, but it is still VERY firm. It would be ok if you always sleep on your side, but it is much too hard for sleeping on stomach or back."
3,"UPDATE TO ""GREAT WITHOUT THE COVER!""","I wish I had read more reviews before purchasing the pillow. I struggled to put the cover on, only to spend a miserable night. Next day I read reviews about using it without the supplied cover. One reviewer said it was like sleeping on a concrete block with padding. I AGREE! After replacing the supplied cover with an ordinary pillowcase, I LOVE IT. Have only had it for a couple of weeks so don't know how it will hold up. Will keep you posted.UPDATE-Afer using this for several weeks, I find the beads are collapsing and portions of the pillow are getting too soft. I may have to put the original cover on."
2,is this supposed to be for your neck?,"This pillow is WAY too hard and high to be a neck pillow. You'll end up with neck problems after using it. However, I do like to prop my calves up on in when lying down. It has great support and doesn't sink/flatten. BUT FOR YOUR HEAD AND NECK?!?! NO WAY!"
2,Wasn't comfortable at all,"Bought because I have fibromyalgia & CFS & get a lot of pressure induced head pain when sleeping. This pillow wasn't helpful at all with or without the cover, without the cover was a little better but I ended up going back to a memory foam contour. If you need something extremely soft but supportive I wouldn't recommend as it just feels too firm."
3,A bit firmer than expected...,"I bought this hoping it would be ""squishy"" which is what my son was looking for, it is much firmer than anticipated, especially when putting the enclosed cover on it. We replaced that with a king size pillowcase and it moves a bit more, but is still too firm for our preference."
1,wasnt for me,"i tried a certain kind & was hoping this would be the same but cheaper but it was like sleeping on a rock...had to return it, got a headache"
4,Chock Full of Features,"I bought this online several months ago and am very pleased with both the sound and functional quality, however it has so many features that I often need to keep the manual handy to figure out how to use them, and I'm not the kind of person who normally needs to do this, you with me?"
2,not comfortable for the price that I paid,I have to say I was very disappointed - I would not buy another pair of Earth shoes again as these are not comfortable at all.
2,"Pretty nice, but not strong enough","This handle from Laurey looks pretty nice when installed. The only problem we've seen is that the welding spot for the two mouting posts isnot strong enough...we got 2 that broke out of the 35 we installed in ourkitchen. The 2 that broke were installed in doors, so there is no actual weight as when you mount on drawers.Ivan Ochoa from Douglas, AZ."
1,Very cheap,"Mine all arrived damaged. It was as if they had been rubbed against a rock and there were pits all over the face of the handles. Even without the pitting, they were very thin, and the edges were sharp, not very comfortable in your hand.I'd keep looking!"
4,great product,product is exactly what i need--only fault is that ice does melt must keep machine on constantly and it remakes ice as water melts
1,Leaked like a sieve,Didn't even hold water - leaked out the back as if something was never tightened. Never even got a chance to use it. It is going straight back.
3,Ice Melts,"This machine works great except for one very important item. If I don't empty the ice basket quickly, i.e., soon after it fills, the ice begins to melt. Is this normal or is this a defect in the machine? This is being used in a mobile home clubhouse for our parties which are about four a month. Should it be disconnected in between parties. If I fill it with water at 10am and come back at noon, the ice has been melting. Please let me know if this happens to you."
3,It works as it says.,"It works as described.Quiet and pretty quick.The tank sits under the bin so basically you remove the collection tray and pour the water in.It makes up the ice and dumps it in this small tray.As the ice melts it goes back into the tank.The ice tray could be bigger to allow for larger capacity. But hey,it's not a commercial unit.It's good for say, parties were you may be making a fair amount of mixed drinks at a remote location.Also you should drain out the water and not let it sit for more than 24 hours.For the price you really can't beat it.All in all not a bad unit."
4,Plastic tasting ice,"I really like this ice maker if you use the ice right away. We liked it for taking camping. But now that I have it running in the house, we do not use the ice as fast. After a day or two, it has an icky plastic or rubber taste. I wrote the company to see if they had a remedy but of course I didn't get a response. Anyone else have this problem? Any remedies?"
1,Nice ice maker,I have used this ice maker for two years and I am really happy with it. Comes in real handy when the kids and grandkids come to visit.
3,Keep your receipt!!,"We purchased this ice maker in September 2008. We were so very happy with the ice maker. We kept it next to the freezer and would transfer the ice to a huge bucket for storage. I would guess that, over the 8 months it was operational, it saved us so much money compared to purchasing the 20 lb bags of ice from our grocery store at $5.00 each.In May 2009, the ice bucket arm (made of plastic) broke. Like an idiot, I had thrown away the receipt. It is under warranty through Magic Chef for one year...but not unless you have your receipt. Magic Chef said they will send me the part for free, but it is currently on back-order until the 2nd week in July. At that point, I will need to take it apart myself and hope I can put the new ice bucket arm in without ruining it.So, overall it was a great investment...but it did break. 3 stars is the best I can do. Anyone buying this just needs to hold onto their receipt!!"
2,Attention! Porter Cable Users,"If you own the Porter Cable RN 175, do not buy these nails. I tried to use these nails and they did not fit properly in the gun. However, if you have a Hitachi nail gun, they work fine. I was dissappointed because I thought they would work well with my Porter Cable gun. Happy Roofing!"
3,There are better nails,"Yes, these nails do fit the PC RN 175 roofing nailer but they can be a pain to load and they seemed to jamb a little more often than the other brand nail (of identical length) that I used. I found it helped to not take a coil of nails out of the box since they sit in a pre-formed or molded container, until just before loading into the gun. I'm not a pro but I did get the job done and these tools are light years better than using a hammer & nail which is primitive in comparison."
4,"Same material, and then some","For fans of the whitest kids you know sketch show this is a great buy, it has the popular ""Get a new Daddy"" ""Hitler Rap"" and ""Let's wake up your neighbors"" included, which I Was very happy to find.The Wkuk are inappropriate and not afraid to push illicit items, but they are funny enough that even those with the highest morals may even crack a smile.My only complaint is that it was too short. I am in much great need for much more wkuk content!Anyways, get it, it is very good and got me laughing quite a bit. Plus, if you don't like it, you could give it to your dad."
5,Remove Head from Rectum,"How is this a marketing trick? Oh wait, its not, its a comedy cd from the tv series so before you post your ignorant statments,do as the title states. I mean, jesus christ, are we really devolving that fast."
2,OK for a beach read,"I admit to having purchased this book solely because of the title. I then read it over a beach-weekend and found it suitable: decent plot, fast-paced, didn't require much thought, and up-beat. Being a parrot owner, I found quite a few issues with the author's details on parrot behaviour and care (for example, chocolate for parrots is a huge no-no since it is toxic). But for most people, the side-kick antics of the parrot will be mildly amusing. The main character is likeable enough and though there is no depth to the character development, it was enough to keep my attention .... at the beach."
5,Endearing and Meaningful,"""Two Days in May"" is a sweet and endearing story about a girl who discovers deer grazing in her mother's urban garden. Neighbors gather around the deer in the small garden, and band together in an effort to save the deer and keep them from harm. A wildlife rescuer is called in to help. This story teaches a valuabe lesson on the humane removal of wildlife from urban areas. It also demonstrates how people who may not always get along can join together for a worthy cause and subsequently learn and grow from the experience. The text and the illustrations are beautiful. ""Two Days in May"" would be excellent to teach in an animal unit or an environmental unit. It would also be a treasure simply for pleasure reading that also offers meaningful messages. Another excellent book with a positive environmental message is ""Secret Place"" by Eve Bunting."
4,1999 Américas Commended List,"A Latino family is at the center of a quiet picture story set in a multicultural urban neighborhood where everyone pulls together when five deer show up in a community garden. As soon as the neighbors learn that the animal control office plans to shoot the deer, they decide to camp out in the garden overnight to protect the deer until a wildlife rescue organization come out to pick them up the next day. A strong sense of community and an awareness of vanishing natural habitats are at the core of this discussion-provoking story which is based on a true event."
1,Difficult to love,"This book sounded wonderful from the online reviews, but I was sorely disappointed. The details were certainly fascinating, but I found the author's style jarring and disjointed. Certainly the grace of Japan is evident in the novel, but my concentration just kept getting derailed by the author's prose."
4,beautiful language,"this is a novel to savor for the way it it told more than for the story itself.as has been said elsewhere:the story-line is somewhat overlongand there are many lose ends --but to me it does not matter.it is a lovely, languid piece of writing,even if it dos not necessarily go anywhere much.in that way it is like breathing in and breathing out:of value in itself.it is one of the books i think i will read again in the future."
4,Japanese Historical Fiction,"Another historical novel,The Snow Fox: A Novel, takes readers to a Japan of 1000 years ago, and imagines the love story between Lady Utsu, a woman renowned for her beauty and her poetry, and a Samurai named Matsuhito, who is sworn to Lady Utsu's protector, the driven Lord Norimasa. There is a mystery behind Utsu and Matushito, as well. Who are their parents? Could they even be brother and sister? Four children are mixed up as a means of confusing an enemy lord, and then the puzzle is forgotten, sort of.Based in legend, and with images abounding on the net, the story of Utsu and Matsuhito is quite compelling, and also gives a taste of life as Fromberg Schaeffer imagines it in Japan in the time of the samurai. I would recommend this book for anyone interested in a good historical romance."
1,High School,"I bought this book thinking I might pick up something to add to my skills, boy was I wrong! The other two reviewers must work for the author because there is nothing to this book at all. In addition the price for this nothing is ridiculous. Do yourself a favor save your money. I don't want anyone else to get taken."
3,A Decent Read,"How to Be Her Best Lover Ever is a decent read. This guide includes many useful tips and strategies in dealing with anxiety and frustration, but it is not worth $9.99 for the kindle and $40 for the paperback edition. I would recommend it for anyone willing to learn and improve themselves, just don't set your expectations too high."
5,All you need,"What i like about this author is definitely his style. There is no fluff talk and only useful information. Im tired of books about sex or relationships and self-improvement, that they are all full of fluff talk and they same the same and the same topic over and over again. Or they say general things that really gets me angry. Here at last we have specific poionts and really what you have to do exactly in this topic : the sex . It has a lot of information despite its length that you wont find anywhere and it actually works. The woman will go crazy. Moreover its not full of garbage knowledge like the 365 sex positions and how to do it. Here we have realistic things and topics about: How to do sex with your mouth - how to do sex with your penis - thisg to improve your sex drive and the exactly conditons steb by steb on how to do it. It is definitely my only and best book in this subject. 5 STARS - AMAZING"
4,Good video and great value!,"It is very hard for us to catch Thomas on television. I am not sure about other countries, but here (U.S.A.) George Carlin was who we grew up with as the storyteller. I also thougt the price paid was well worth the 11 stories on the tape. The only downfall, I felt was the footage between the stories."
3,ten years of Thomas,"(Thomas and Bertie's great race) This episode is kind of cool, but it wasn't that great.(Old Iron)Was the best one yet, but still it was only 99% good.(The Trouble with Mud)Gordon refused to get washed and pays by pulling frieght.(Terence the tractor)Thomas gets stuck and it's up to Terence to save the day.(Percy's ghostly trick)Percy tricks Thomas and Toby.(Mavis)Mavis breaks the rules.(Henry the elephant)an elephant pushes Henry out of a tunnel.(Thomas anthem)the singalong is neat, too."
4,Excellent beginning of an excellent career,"This is a great CD to get a feel for the early Muddy Waters. The double CD is really packed with some great songs--at a great price, I may add. It's wonderful to sit back and listen to the CDs from beginning to end and hear the transition in Muddy's play from Delta to Chicago blues!"
4,Good collection/overview of Water's earlier work with Chess,This a good collection/overview of Muddy Water's early years (in the late 40's and very early 50's) with Chess. This has some great music on it and features some of the monumental blues songs that would change the music forever. Great stuff!
4,My two favorite things in the world,"I have always held that the Ramones were just playing traditional, early rock and roll very, very fast, and these guys prove it by playing the boys' tunes as if they were written by Gene Vincent. I adore it, especially the slap bass."
1,waste of money,"no one should spend money on this disc. as a ramones fan i am always interested in other bands takes on the songs, there is not one song that i would be willing to play a second time"
5,Simple and Effective Hair Dryer,"Blow dries fast. Comfortable hand grip. The buttons are easy to understand and well situated, so that the user does not accidentally change settings. The attachments and brush work well. Sensor touch feature seems to function based on the movement of the dryer. As long as the dryer is kept in motion, it stays on. Overall, fantastic product."
2,Stylish but flawed,"This map light puts out more than enough light for map or book reading. It has a stylish silver knob for the on/off switch. (4 stars) And that is its flaw. The knob is nicely sized. But it is mounted on less than a 1/8-inch tab. The tab does not have the strength to prevent the knob from binding on the push-down motion. As a result, people think that the real on/off-action is to twist it. And the knob breaks easily. (1 star - it might be repairable with glue gun)."
3,Not my favorite,I like Amy Bento in step aerobics but this work out was not for me. Definitely would buy another of her step work outs but not another boot camp.
3,"Not Great, But Funky","Get Close is one of those albums you put away for a while but keep coming back to. It's not the best Chrissy Hynde has released, but it's just ... average. The Pretenders are always evolving with different members coming aboard all the time. My favorite cuts are For Your Soul and the gorgeous Chill Factor. There is no doubt in my mind that Chrissy Hynde has one of the best voices in the music industry. Get Close showcasesa funky side that was missing in a lot of their earler (and better) releases. Not the best the Pretenders have put out, but not a bad release either. If you want to get funky some day, play Get Close !"
3,Not the best but worth the purchase,"Just as when I bought this disc back in 1987 I've enjoyed and listened to for a couple weeks and now it's back on the shelf. We were all just getting used to a new set of Pretenders with ""Learning to Crawl"" when she sprung a brand Pretenders on us, plus the songs were weak.Rick"
3,Weakest album since Pretenders II,"Thank goodness for programmable CD players. Some of the songs on this album among the best that Chrissie Hynde has ever done: ""My Baby,"" ""Hymn To Her,"" ""Don't Get Me Wrong,"" for example.On the other hand, to get to those gems, you'll have to put up with weak stuff like ""Dance!,"" ""How Much Did You Get For Your Soul?,"" ""I Remember You,"" and the misguided cover of Hendrix's ""Room Full Of Mirrors."" Not only does that Hendrix tune sound completely out of place next to the rest of the songs, it proves once again why Hendrix tunes are so hard to cover effectively: Hendrix's mastery of the electric guitar just can't be duplicated."
4,A high point in power pop,"This is the album to get, if you want to know the Pretenders. There are some fantastic pop songs here - Don't Get Me Wrong, My Baby - and some album cut classics - Hymn to Her, Light of the Moon - that just rock. The production is excellent, the musicians are excellent, and the songwriting is some of Chrissie's best.OK, there are some duds. (Show me someone who gets it 100% of the time.) But that's part of listening to albums. You can get some of the great cuts on ""The Singles"", but this is the one I still listen to a lot."
5,Best Album By A Great Band,"Its the eighties. The White House goes Hollywood. Reagan , Iran -Contra, Olie North and good lord even Dylan is getting all Jesused up and Punk has gone god awful Madonna. All in all as good a decade as any to spend in a blackout. Yet shining through the coma is this glorious shimmering,pulsating tasty bit of aural reprieve. Miss Christie is here to save the day! Give it a close listen and maybe you'll even remember where you left the car."
4,"i am not rating this, all im saying is.....","First of all, i really like the pretenders.But if you dont like poppy albums, you probably wouldnt like this at all. it sounds like they are trying to hard to fit in with the popular sound of the time, like radio stuff. you forget that the pretenders are a band. there is even this song that is suppose to be a dance song where this guy just repeats this phrase over and over again.im not hating on this album. you just might want to hear it first before you buy it.Who knows, you might like it, or you might not. its all about the style you like."
5,Really great 2-disc set,"For those who appreciate the hymns together with excellent performance and quality, this is a great set. It is the only one, so far, that I have chosen to own, in style and effect being neither steeped in the traditional restraints of the ""acapella-only-for-congregational-music"" types nor weakened by so much of today's modern yet lame and annoying remix versions. I have been many times let down and irritated with either the blandness of some of the more traditional productions... or the obnoxious noise and ""whining-ness"" of so many modernized versions afloat recently.Some of these arrangements constructed are fabulous. The more mellow will soothe or inspire, while the the upbeat is uplifting. I wish I could experience certain ones (i.e. Pass Me Not, Jesus, Lover of My Soul) live by those who actually performed them for the album."
1,Only fit for the bin,"What a complete waste of money! I'm a big fan of Peter Cook but this is best avoided. A collection of poor quality recordings of random conversations that are so hard to follow that it is not even of minimal biographical interest, let alone being entertaining in any way - forget it!"
5,One of the best animes you'll find in America right now.,"Bandai is on anime roll lately. First Witch Hunter Robin, then Wolf's Rain and now this. Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex is one of the most beautiful/interesting/action packed animes I have ever seen. The story is amazing and the characters are very likeable. This special edition DVD comes with 3 discs. The first being the normal DVD, the 2nd being a DTS version of the DVD and the 3rd is the first soundtrack to the anime (which by the way, this anime has a GREAT soundtrack). My only real complaint is why Bandai chose to only put 4 episodes on this first disc? The first disc is usually 5 episodes... Other then that slight ""rip-off"", this anime is MUST HAVE."
1,Don't get ripped off by Bandai,"This is an absolutly great series but, don't buy the deluxe addition. Bandai messed up the OST, leaving out songs and miss labeling others."
4,Wonderful series that suffers from compression artifacts,"I would agree with most of the nice comments said about the series itself. This is a wonderful series for all us cyberpunks who were disappointed with Bubblegum Crisis 2040. That being said, there are some technical issues with the first two DVDs with terms of motion artifacts that are quire frequent and noticible. This will obviously not affect watching it on a computer or a progressive scan tv and dvd player. I just with that Manga wasn in charge if the encoding overseeing as their reputation isn't exactly one of quality (Perfect Blue and Royal Space Force are great examples of this). Again, if you watch it on progressive scan then you have nothing to worry about, the sound is beautiful and the art is very stylish. Don't worry about the whole series, Disc 3 didn't appear to have this problem as Bandai reacted to the consumer complaints smoothed out many of the artifacts from Disc 3 on."
1,soundtrack CD is knackered,The soundtrack CD is all screwed up! Track 8 on the CD includes both track 8 (velveteen) and 9 (lithium flower) while track 11 is the first part of the song (fish~silent cruise) and track 12 continues the song. There's also a blank 19th track.The DTS disc also has a sound glitch were there is little to no audio coming from the rear-left speaker.
2,Cartoon Network-level Anime,"A knockoff anime that does little by way of plot, special effects, or emotional manipulation - all sucessfully accomplished by the breakthrough Ghost in the Shell feature film. Even the signature character designs from the film have been passed on for quick, mass-production 2D, cell shaded anime designs.Only redeeming quality of these GiTS SAC DVDs is that English is optional.Get the DVD of the film instead. Or try Ninja Scroll TV if you really need an anime feature film spinoff that works on its own."
1,Doesn't Do The Movie Justice!,"I liked Ghost In The Shell, the movie version. But this Stand Alone Complex is nothing like the movie. What happened to the Puppet Master, in the movie version? I have to admit, Stand Alone Complex is visually stunning, but other than that, it's nothing to cheer about. If you want to see the real Ghost In The Shell, then see the movie version. This Stand Alone Complex just doesn't measure up!"
2,"Different Ghost, Different Shell","Except for most of the characters, this movie is completely different from the original Ghost in the Shell. It lacks the visual beauty, interesting score and has become just another fast paced anime. I feel I have been misled by the title into expecting a sequel of the original with similar qualities."
5,Can't Wait,Awesome show. Very mysterious very cool bad guy the Laughing Man. Beautifully animated. The music is some of the best of any anime or any tvshow/movie. Very cool characters. Very cool futuristic setting that doesn't seem to far away from where we are today. I have been dying to see the english dubb of this cus its a very technical show and the subs scroll quite fast many times. Yes I WILL own this show!
2,Not What I Expected,"I stopped watching this after the first episode. The Animation is nothing like the movie GITS. Also there is quite a bit of cgi used in the series. The music was nothing like the original and the actors who did the english dub sounded corny to me. The only similarity between this and the movie is the premise and plot. All of the atmospherics are gone. There are numerous still shots where only the mouth moves. This is a very tame and uncreative version of ghost in the shell. All in all if your a die hard fan, I guess you will like this no matter what. If you expect a lot as I did you will be diappointed."
4,NINJA COSTUME,My son really enjoyed his costume. I found it a little difficult to lace up every time he tried to put it on.
3,mindful?,"Ellen Langer can write really well. She can also speak really well. However, if one is truely mindful they will realize that you must become nervous about applying one theory to everything."
2,A childish view of human behavior,"Childish, simplistic, overly geared towards FEEL good solutions , and much to idealistic! However, makes some good points."
2,Not what I thought it was,"If you are looking for an enjoyable treatise on bringing awareness to everyday life, this is not the book for you. The author does not have an engaging, easy-to- read style. Rather the work is much more scientific in tone and probably helpful to one trained and interested in psychology/psychiatry and counseling modalities."
1,unintelligible,I had difficulty following or understandingmuch of this. I'm very disappointed.The studies she relates don't appearto be at all scientific. I could noteven describe what she calls mindfullness.I probably won't finish the book becauseit's a waste of my time.
4,Mindfulness,"I really like this book in presenting in class the opposite of ""mindfulness"".....""mindlessness"". This is not a particularly great book, but it holds much for those who are teaching, and willing to put some thought into what ""mindfullness"" is not."
3,A little too detailed,Good subject. good presentation...however it told me more than I wanted to know as to how the author and her students set up experiments and arrived at their conclusions. My conclusion is that the princilpes are simpler than her process.
5,Deeply inspiring book,The book touches on some great concepts and uses research data to make key points. The example of confrontation between Napoloean and Kutuzov to illustrate how changing perspectives and being aware of new information is excellent. Perspective-changing book.
4,Solid As A Rock,"Fireball is truly one awesome recording by Deep Purple. In between all the heavy sounds there are some creative touches most notably from keyboardist Jon Lord and drummer Ian Paice. The drum fills are a pure joy to listen to on No No No and The Mule as they compliment Ian Gillan's vocals stylings to a T. The keyboard touches are great throughout. Whether its The Noise Abatement Society Tapes, Fools, or the previously mentioned No No No, they all are done with the upmost creativitiy. No One Came is another highlight on the record with some ultra cool lyrics.The extra tracks just add to the value of this recording. Pick it up at once."
5,Comments by an old Deep Purple Fan,"This is definiteley the darkest and heaviest album of deep purple in the 70's. The lyrics in this album are great, actually the best deep purple has ever shown. The songs are quite simple, but very fascinating, very honest. This was my first DP CD and it will be my favorite."
4,best of the best from DP,"yes this MK II album is my fave one. No bad songs on this album, plus comments of Roger Glover (bassist) The sound is clear and had been remastered. Fireball the title track itself is like a comet who had fallen to the earth. Demons eye has a beautiful lyric, Anyone's daughter is a typical Ian Gillan sense of humour. That is not a big mistake, if you buy this album.....go & buy it now! Deep purple fans can't be wrong."
4,Could have - and should have been - 5 stars!,"Great job on the remaster and great job on the liner notes. Major problem? The decision to scrap the original version of ""Strange Kind Of Woman"" in favor of Glover's '96 remix. What's that all about? Not only does it make the album's claim - ""the complete original album remastered plus bonus tracks"" - a falsehood; it also deprives the listener (this one in particular) the opportunity to have that sonic gem in its best available form."
2,"Good Action, but torture scenes were quite unsettling","The action was first-rate, and the book kept me flipping pages, but I felt the torture of women in this book was too much to bear at times. Every major female character suffered in some way. I'm not squeamish, and can handle violence, but I felt the violence in this book was way too excessive."
5,A Fast-Paced Fun-Filled Romp,"US army Inspectors George Sueno and Ernie Bascom walk the beat in Itaewon, Seoul's ""Neon Supermarket"", the pleasure center of Seoul. They get mixed up with Herman ""The German"" Burkowicz, an army retiree who is living off his pension and his thriving business smuggling Korean antiques out of the country when his adopted daughter is kidnapped by a group of Mongol cultists, who seek a priceless skull supposedly inscribed with a map to Kublai Khan's lost treasures. Unfortunately, Herman doesn't have the skull, which is why he needs Sueno and Bascom.Martin Limon has put together a story of high adventure, weaving together a tale with more twists than the Korean alleys in which the action is set. BUDDAH'S MONEY is a tightly written, fast-paced, fun-filled romp told in a tough guy style that you're guaranteed to enjoy. I know I enjoyed it."
1,Trash trash trash,"This book should be burned. There is terrible violence against a child, graphically described, that left me wondering what kind of man could even put these things on paper. What is worse, neither the abuse of the child nor the graphic descriptions of it were necessary for the plot.That said, even without these scenes, the plot was absurd. An army of Mongolian fanatics who don't look like Koreans but can beat up even the most skilled crime fighters with a quick kick or sucker punch to the diaphragm, seem to be able to move through underside of the town unseen, taking over a Buddhist Temple, and asking random people to find a lost treasure on threat of more harm to the child. Why does no one think of using an adult man as a victim?If I can stop one person from reading this book, my work here is done."
1,Donate your money to Buddha instead!,"Limon's two previous books were atmospheric, with sustainable plots, and interesting characters. Buddha's Money retains a bit of the first characteristic and absolutely none of the others. The basic plot premise is absurd, the story is weak, and his ""Ernie"" character has turned into a pointless idiot!It's hard to believe that the same author who wrote ""Jade Lady Burning"" and ""Slicky Boys"" also wrote this book."
1,Wonderful series but skip this one,"I love this series, but this particular book is just unspeakable. There is an ongoing plot line of the torture, dismemberment (ongoing) and sexual violation of a small girl that is just unbelievable. There is an ethical dimension to writing, as in all things, which in my opinion, this author has violated. I don't think it should ever have been written and I question why it was ever published."
5,A controversial issue handled graciously and accurately,"White's book is a fine contribution that clarifies the subtantial theological differences between Rome and historic, biblical Christianity. What a welcome antidote this book is to the fluffy, at times silly, arguments of those like Scott Hahn on the other side. White carefully demonstrates how Rome has sadly departed from important elements of the biblical gospel of grace. He clearly shows that Paul and James are of one accord in teaching salvation by grace alone, through faith alone. The old objections which pit Paul against James, etc., are shown for the superficialities that they are. This book is a must read for those interested in the subject."
1,Poor James...,"He needs to quit talking and writing and start *listening* to his own sister, Patty Bonds, who converted to Catholicism. Don't waste your money. Instead, go check out the books on Catholic apologetics by authors like Patrick Madrid, Scott Hahn, David Currie, Mark Shea and Dave Armstrong etc etc and check the ratings for yourself against garbage like this by James White Dave Hunt. See for yourself who's winning the Cath/Prot debate. Christ said when He gave Peter the keys to the kingdom that the gates of Hades would not prevail against His church and the proof is in the ratings of books like this one by James R. White."
1,Poor writing and poor arguments,This book is not worth your time or money. All of the arguments presented are very amateur and shallow.
1,Divide and Conquer,"Divide and conquer a tactic the devil knows well. When the world seeks to isolate,marginalize and return Christians to the catacombs to worshiping in secret, the author, as well as, those involved in his ministry are useful idiots to that end."
4,A Good Job,"James White has done a good job in this book. James has balanced up the issues well and not in a condeming way.Martin Luther was certainly right when he made the bold comment that the issue of the human free will is really the ""hinge on which the whole turns"".Wether it be the Roman Catholic church or any other of the religions of man. It all comes down to the great issue, does God save or does God simply lay out a plan and leave it up to the creature to decide, wether it be by sacraments, confession, mass, free will, ect, ect.Not only do Catholics hate Dr White but so do many people who would call themselves protestants. Dr White is proudly a christian from the Calvinist side, and by the grace of God so am I. That is the issue that will put a lot of people off this book.God Bless"
3,Convinced Me To Convert To Catholicism,"I read this book during my discernment process while in the RCIA program. I had expected that Dr. White would unconvincingly prove to me to remain a Protestant. While Dr. White does make an initial prima facie case against Catholicism, his arguments are easily defeated by Catholic rebuttals. Furthermore, Dr. White deliberately avoids many of the tougher counter-arguments posited by Catholic apologists. Hence, instead of convincing me to remain Protestant, it affirmed the fact that the fullness of Christian Truth has only been fully revealed through the Roman Catholic Church, which I was honored to be welcomed into communion with this Easter."
4,A good refutation of certain Roman Catholic teachings,"This is an excellent work for anyone who wishes to engage in the Roman Catholic/Protetsant debate. White is a first rate scholar who really provides strong evidence agianst Roman Catholicism. My only complaint is that at times, his arguments can be a little hard to follow."
1,"Can I give a Rating of ""0"" Stars?","I really can't say it better than alfonso_trujillo@hotmail.com from San Diego, except to add another great book that gives a fine explanation of the Roman Catholic Church. That would be the similarly-titled ""The Catholic Controversy,"" by St. Francis de Salles. This truly is a masterpiece of defense of the Catholic Faith. I don't know why James R. White chose the title he did for his book, but I can't help wondering if he thought he might in that way mislead readers looking for St. Francis' marvellous tome. In any case, I urge everyone who is interested & who wants to know the truth about the Catholic Church to read St. Francis' book. Then decide for yourself who makes the most sense about sola scriptura, etc."
1,Give me a break!,"Poor Arguments. As a Southern Baptist, I bought this book trying to lean about the Catholic faith from the Protestant point of view. The book actually helped me believe the Catholic Church was the Church founded by Christ. If you are in need of a good laugh, buy this. Or if you run out of fire wood."
4,Good Posse Story,"Easy but good western style reading.Right down to, a street view, looking at the sky ""the promise of rain was heavy""and a rider entering the town (not a stranger, darn!)So, put on your slickers (ponchos) and headout with the posse.That made a good dust jacket.Warning: There's some bad seed element in it,in case some of you buckaroos might be sensitive."
3,Zeno's first since Tha Drunx,"This is Zenos best cd, KC (remix) ft. Vell Bakardy & AMG, and I'm A Thug are the best songs!"
4,Great Information,"If you are thinking about starting a yoga practice, you should look into this book."
5,Excellent,"This is album is great. Soraya's vocal range can be very sweet to rugged. She reminds a little bit of another Colombian artist, Shakira. It ranges from ballads to folk dance tracks."
3,AGAINST THE WALL,"I'm a Soraya fan, but i'm not a crazy dumb who don't have taste speaking of music. And she still have this sweet voice, and ""Si Te Vas"" ""Lejos de Aquí"" ""El Cruce"" and ""Será El Final?"" are amazing, and beautiful songs...Anyway i don't feel so good in some tracks as ""Dulce Amor"" ""Es un Amor"" and ""Paris,Cali,Milan"" and ""Torre de Marfil"" and by the way i hate this one: ""Cosas de la Vida"", no...this was kind of boring, but the good ones makes this cd worth."
3,Labels may not be helpful for young children,"I love Todd Parr's animated illustrations and charm. But after purchasing this book and reading it to my 2-year old, I wasn't as excited about this particular book. The labels ""good"" and ""bad"" are used in a way that it introduces ideas into a young child's mind. Like some of the examples were ""good:light"", ""bad: the dark"". I am trying to teach my daughter NOT to think of the dark as something bad and not to be afraid of! So that's not too helpful. Also, it has ""monsters: bad"" as well as ""big hairy spiders: bad"". We're trying to convince my daughter that monsters don't exist, not that they are ""bad"" and make her scared even more. The other labels in the book are funny, like ""smelly feet: bad"" and ""hot chocolate with marshmallows: good"".I know Todd Parr just wanted to write a funny book for kids. But if your children are at the stage where they are scared of things or take things very literally, then you might want to choose a different book!"
3,where are the 70's?,"I love the Dead. I saw at least 50 or 60 shows and I would walk the length of this continent if they asked me to for what Jerry Garcia and their music has done for me in my life. But my question is when can we see some video from the golden years of the early 70's or late 60's? I know they have to have some? At least enough for one dvd !!!! I camped at Alpine Valley many times, and I'm sorry but these are not their best moments by a long shot. However, this is still great stuff from one of the best bands to tour this land and bring us so much great music. Now can I have some older gritty stuff from the vault please???"
5,Memories!!!!!!!,"I was there, it actually made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. It was by far one of the best shows that I ever seen. Now I can see it again and again and again and again and again. The first time was just a BLUR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Dead Showcase,"This DVD is really excellent all the way through, but the ""Deal"" first-set closer absolutely stone rocks!! It starts off as a kind of hippie shuffle and then rockets into Grateful Dead Rock 'n Roll Outer Space for several awesome minutes before gliding in to a perfect three-point landing. The band is totally locked into it. I often play this DVD for my rocker friends who are not always sure about the Dead, and they are always amazed. Check it out!"
2,"Would be the best, but for HORRIBLE VIDEO quality","Really, this could be the best Grateful Dead DVD from their later period. Unlike much of the View from the Vault series, the music is superb --- culled from a group of very inspired performances --- and non-Deadheads won't fall asleep watching it. But, the color and the resolution on the DVD is INFERIOR. I know this because the VHS picture quality is much better. And, someone inside the Dead organization told me that Monterey Video (who oversees the process) used an inferior process to go from VHS to DVD. Really, there is no reason why this video shouldn't look just as good as all the other View from the Vaults -- at least VFV IV (which was same year).Sorry 'bout this, Grateful Dead people -- but I have to be straight with you."
5,It's like your there.....,"Truly a must have for any dead fan. If you have never been to a Dead show, this is the closest thing to it. They don't stray off the concert and show alot of tripy images as the music goes on. There are many camera angles with lots of close-ups. You see more on this DVD than you would at any concert. There are no interviews just the band doing what they do best. It's clearly the best DVD concert I've seen yet."
5,A Band Beyond Description,"Quite simply the best Dead DVD on the market. Jerry is as energetic as I've ever seen him-- even playful at times. This show in 1989 represents a revival of sorts for the Dead. Though many point to the early and late 70's as the classic era of the Dead, and rightfully so, this show is as good as any I've heard from that era. First set is solid. Excellent 'Cat to Rider' kicks off the second set. 'The Wheel' is also a homerun. My only complaint is the the encore of Johnny B Good. But all things considered, this disc is a must have for any deadhead."
5,This is awesome music,"I first heard The Space Cossacks on the surf channel on an online radio player (it used to be ""spinner""). I like what I heard alot, so I found more of their stuff on a P2P file swapping app. When the time came for me to put the best of my downloaded surf music on a cd, I ended up putting almost all of the Space Cossacks songs that I had downloaded on the cd.... It just so happened the the Space Cossacks had some of the best music among all of the various surf songs I had found. This group is great, and now I'm buying their cd's."
5,excellent book-great for your Jewish pre-teen/teen,I read this book to see if I wanted to assign it for my Hebrew School class. It is great. I couldn't put it down. It can really relate to today's kids rather than some of the older books that are out there. It also addresses anti-semetism in a way that they will understand.
3,"a quick read, but not much depth","This book was a quick read, but the plot was predictable and there was not much depth. The book addresses the important issue of anti-Semitism, but doesn't get too far into it. I loved the book until the part when the boy Melissa finds obnoxious is being beaten up by his father. It could have brought something to the story, but instead the incident is mentioned once and never brought up again. Also disappointing was the end, when the author could have made the ending exciting, but instead Melissa's biggest worry is getting a watch back while avoiding suspension. Overall a good book when you want something that doesn't require a lot of thinking."
2,UP THE QUALITY,"WAS PLEASED WITH THE PRICE, HOWEVER THE ITEM LEFT A LOT TO BE DESIRED. FRAMES WERE TOO THIN (WHICH WILL CAUSE FLEX) AND SHAFT HAD NO TYPE OF BEARINGS FOR SUPPORT. WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN."
5,Introduce yourself to this voice. Please!,"From the first note I heard of this voice I have found it impossible to go an entire day without treating myself to this sheer ear candy, as the saying goes. I am here to stay! This Christmas everyone on my list get Mr. Bocelli..along with Bjork! Ten Stars!! So THIS is Italian opera! Amen."
5,Fantastic!!,"I have had this CD for about 2 months and I can't stop playing it. Without a doubt, it is the best CD I have ever owned. His voice has such clarity, he can hit the high notes and hold them and yet perform great pop Italian songs with the same degree of perfection he puts into the more classical songs.. His duet with Sarah Brightman ""Time to Say Goodbye"" was played at a wedding when the new bride and her Dad danced...there wasn't a dry eye in the house. Do yourself a favor and buy this fantastic recording by a pretty remarkable man."
1,"A putrid, horrendous ""album.""","People, I hope you realize that ""Romanza"" is neither opera or good singing. Bocelli 'sings' some light, poppy fluff in his inimitably superficial, pretty, gee-don't-I-sound-nice voice, unable to hide the fact that he couldn't phrase a melody if his life depended on it. Whereas great singers, in any genre, understand that you must find some contrast in the poetry and music, Bocelli sings everything the same way, in his all-purpose 'expressive' style. Not to mention the fact that he is consistently out of tune in his high register. Don't be fooled people, this is no introduction to opera. Great opera is an epic, exalting, monumental experience. 'Romanza' is the musical equivalent of lobster butter."
5,His music and voice haunts you in a magical way.,"I first saw Andrea Bocelli on PBS and was struck by the tone of his voice, the quality of his range and the hauntingness of the melodies. I have followed him ever since that evening on PBS. I enjoy this man, his voice, his song, his stature and his angelic spirit."
5,Tremendous Album and a Must Have for Any JOHN MILES fans,Apart from being a wonderful album it has a bonus track with Andrea dueting with John Miles. One reviewer asked if John has done anything else. There are two sites and a discussion group with a link to one of the sites. Search under Johnmiles (ie no space)
4,Magnificent!,"Having witnessed the fountains at Bellagio (Las Vegas), I fell in love with the music! For those that find the traditional opera too violent on the ears, try Andrea Bocelli! A truley gifted artist. Definitely one for a romantic event or for self indulgence."
2,Andrea Bocelli is the Italian Michael Bolton,"There were too many songs on the CD that were remniscient of Michael Bolton. I would have preferred to hear more classical arias with Symphony accompaniments, however Andrea Bocelli's voice is spectacular in any form."
4,Mellow and Romantic,"I first heard Andrea Bocelli sing ""Con Te Partiro"" on the Oprah show and was swept away in emotion. Italian is truly the language of love. I found the entire album to be very easy listening and wonderful, soft, background music. Being from Italy myself, I love hearing those words that I used to know so well."
4,Sounded like Angels from Across the Street,"While walking the Strip in Las Vegas I heard the most beautiful music I have ever heard (I'm a mobile D.J. I've heard a lot) It sounded like Angels singing. Across the street the Bellagio fountain show was in progress and they were playing ""Time to Say Goodbye"". I bought the CD the next day. It is now used for background music at the wedding receptions I D.J. Many people have come up to me and asked who this is and where can they find the CD. If only all the good things in life were under $20.00"
5,SUPERB!!!!,Andrea's Romanza engulfs the soul of the listener. This album takes me back to Europe each time I listen to it.
5,Excellent New Tenor,"This is an excellent CD, and I very much enjoy listening to it at work. Andrea Bocelli has an excellent voice, and you can hear the passion and joy with which he sings. He also does a great job of singing with contemporary Italian pop singers (Gerardina Trovato and Zucchero)"
2,very disappointed,"I fell in love with Andrea Bocelli singing Time to say goodbye. It brought tears to my eyes. Today it still manages to do that every time. However I was not happy with the rest of this album. The Spanish version is not recorded well - it sounds like it has a lot of static. If you plan on playing it loud like I do the static get in the way of enjoying it. I thought that most of the songs would be in the style of Time to Say Goodbye - they were not. I have yet to hear the whole thing because each time I listen a little way into any other song it drives me absolutely crazy.Would I but it again? Yes, just because I love the one song so much. But the others really aren't worth the time or the money."
2,He's no Domingo.,"Unfortunately, Sarah Brightman must hold back her considerable power in order to keep from burying this barely-operatic tenor. The best track on the CD is Voglio Restare Cosi, the only piece the artist himself wrote. A beautiful song, sung in a pop-voice, accompanied by an instrument called a melodica, which sounds like a cross between a harmonica and an accordian. This track alone justifies ownership of the album. The remaining tracks are palatable, but nothing special. If you're looking for more like ""Time to Say Goodbye"" I suggest buying the album of the same name by Sarah Brightman."
1,How come only the singles were recorded in Spanish?,"This is an in-your-face imitation of the original ""Romanza"" album, except that there are five songs in Spanish (namely, all those that were released as singles). Only ""Vivo Por Ella"" is acceptable, unlike all the other versions which has Andrea's vocals sounding exactly the same. I find no problem with Andrea singing in my native language (Spanish), but it's all the same material minus three songs. It's great, but if he had taken the time to record the whole album in Spanish (like Eros Ramazzotti and Laura Pausini did), it would be better."
5,I would like to know who John Miles is?,"I love this cd, and would really like to know who John Miles is, and does he have any recordings of his own?"
4,An exciting suspense story for children 10 - 14,This suspense novel takes place in the Europe. Two young boys wintess a murder and are on the run! Lots of twists and turns along the way. Well recommended for children 10 -14 who want to read a book that can't easily be put down!
5,Important Historical Narratives In Book Form,"This is a must read for anyone interested in the foundaton of this country. It is a validaton of the ravages of slavery from the voices of those who were born into it. It demonstrates how far African Americans have come through faith, education and family after the systematic attempt to destroy the human spirit of many of those responsible for building this nation.It is an outstanding work of the WPA and one of its projects. These narratives are, along with many more, in the United States National Archives. However, Norman Yetman includes more than fifty important additonal pages of introduction, background information and other important details that make this collection invaluable.The powerful photographs take you into some of the lives of other slaves, allowing them to speak visually."
1,Inferior Quality,I purchased these brads along with a Porter Cable Nailer. The width of the heads are 10% less wide than the Porter Cable brads that I purchased at Home Depot for a cheaper price! The Porter Cable items have a better holding surface too.
1,Wrong size nails for a 16 ga nailer,"These 18 ga nails are not of the size necessary for the 16 ga Porter-Cable Finish Nailer that they are typically advertised with (FN250A). They sometimes came out 2 at a time, not at all, or caused the nailer to jam. I called Porter-Cable, and acquired the correct size nails, and the problems went away. I would not recommend these 18 ga nails, especially for this 16ga nailer."
1,"Small ""Male"" Watch","When I opened the box I gave it to my wife right away, very small and should be classed under female or kids definitely not men. If I didn't tell her I bought myself a watch already it would have been a lil surprise for her but it didn't work our like that and I'm very disappointed"
2,don't get it wet,"I've had this watch for two weeks. Good looking watch, and only $20.95, but after wearing it while cleaning our patio with a hose, the inside fogged up. Condensation is ringing the crystal. I've had inexpensive running watches last for years, but once moisture gets inside, it's dead. During the two weeks it came in contact with high humidity perspiration, suncreen, water. I expect more from this type of watch."
2,Not satisfied,"Very small for man and it looks good only on picture but to actually see it, its a bit disappointing. It is plain and simple. Should be priced at $20 only"
4,Great watch!,"Love this watch. I wanted a simple analog watch with a digital stop watch and alarm function. This watch is that, simple. The band is really easy to clean. Also water resistant so when I forget to take it of before a shower no harm done."
4,Sharp looking watch,"This watch does what it suppose to, cheap and has a look of an expensive one. I go jugging all the time and I after I'm done I go for swim at the beach. I take shower with it as well and it still working just fine. If you are an outdoor person and looking for good but low price watch, this watch will do more than fine."
1,disappointed,"It's very small and too plastic only the light is original ,I think it could fit more a children than an adult"
5,5-Star!,"This watch was mine seconhand, probably about a year old with a different wristband, This watch has been performing beautifully. The only complaint would be that the alarm is a little bit weak. Read: Not a siren. I love this watch. It's smaller than some other behemoths I've had, light enough that I don't even notice it when I'm running. I'm a lifeguard and swim in pools and lakes all summer. This watch is a 10 star instrument, just like every Casio item I've ever had.(p.s. I reccomend the Voguestrap TX51012BK Allstrap for a replacement band, the stock is a little weak.)"
5,Great affordable watch,"Been wearing Casio G-Shocks for years. Decided to try this model since it's Casio as well and appeared to be rugged. It's definitely no where near as thick or impact-resistant as the G-Shocks are but still a nice buy for the price. One drawback is that this particular model isn't as sports-oriented as other models are. This means no lap counter and a less-efficient chronograph. All said, however, very pleased with the watch."
3,Nice Watch,"I received this watch as a gift. If it was a White dial i will be Wowed, unless it was a solar watch then black dial is good enough. But it was a gift so i can't complain.Overall watch function as its supposed to."
1,Disappointing !!,"This product is made from very thin, cheap steel. I haven't seen quality this poor in many years. The manufacturer claims that the glass lid is tempered. This lid is the thinnest glass I have ever seen on a cooking utensil. Even the directions that come with the pan explain how easy it is to break the glass lid. On my first attempt to cook egg whites in the pan I turned the dial to 300 degrees. The canola oil in the pan immediately started smoking. This shouldn't happen, as the smoke point of canola oil is 400 degrees. At a loss for what temperature to use, I turned the temp down to 250 in hopes that I wouldn't end up with runny eggs. By the time the top of the white cooked, the bottom was burning. I highly recommend that you save your money and buy something else."
2,Below Par!,Soft and porous stainless steel - everything sticks (I only use Stainless Steel Cookware so I know how to prep it for cooking ). Power cord too short - can't position skillet properly because of extra long handle and heat control next to handle. No vent hole in lid - moisture drips onto heat control. Must crack the lid open slightly to prevent dripping. The positive is that the heat control maintains the set temperature and the tall legs keep the heat off of the counter top. Surely this can't be American design and engineering. What happen Presto????
2,Flawed design hazardous to cook,"The lid on this frying pan is not vented, so frying chicken is hazardous. the lid permits scalding steam to emit around the perimeter of the lid, especially in the vicinity of the temperature gauge. Cook reaches to turn down temp, burns arm. I'm disappointed, since Presto usually makes good products. margaret l"
3,Satisfaction is limited,Heat control is erratic. Finish inside skillet scratches easily. It's cheaply made and typical of products coming out of China these days. Not near as good as the skillet that was replaced.
4,Better than average,"I bought this frying pan because I've grown tired of the problems associated with Teflon-coated fry pans. I am mostly satisfied with its performance.Pros: It is sturdy and well designed. It uses the same plug-in thermostat as models with Teflon coating. The thermostat is predictable and reasonably accurate.Cons: Just one. Not all stainless steel is the same. For some reason, the manufacturer elected to use one of lesser quality. I can clean it up with cleanser and/or steel wool, but it is a hassle. By comparison, I still have a couple of pots my parents purchased fifty years ago, and they clean up much easier."
3,good quality product,"The product is of good quality. I felt a difference after taking it at bedtime. It did help me fall asleep at times but Inositol is not the answer to my individual, personal sleep problem because it doesn't help me stay asleep."
3,Take it?,"I read that a person with a seizure disorder and who takes the meds that I do may not beable to take Inositol. It was stated that the meds lowers the Inositol levels in the brain and they are not sure if that is what makes the meds work or not, so I decided to ere on the side of caution. However other family members can take it. I know my neighbors love the product."
5,Always makes me think of a warm summer night,"I think this is far and away their best. Their songwriting has never been better. In fact, I've been a little disappointed with each subsequent recording because they're never quite as good as ""By the Light of the Moon""Like a previous reviewer, I'm totally knocked out by the intro to ""One Time One Night"" which opens the CD. It has a great feeling--always makes me want to dance.One of Los Lobo's strengths is its ability to take a variety of musical styles and influences and turn them into their own unique music. ""By the Light of the Moon"" exemplifies this strength. Great songs, fine musicians, great music!"
5,My introduction to LOS LOBOS,"This was my first 'LOBOS' album. When I was growing up my musical influences ran the gamut of 50 styles rock, Top 40 and Tex Mex here is a band that has it all on one album. Isn't that a cool cover?BEST SELECTIONSONE TIME ONE NIGHT, SET ME FREE, MY BABYS GONE, SHAKIN SHAKIN SHAKES, IS THIS ALL THERE IS? ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS DANCE AND PRENDA DEL ALMA"
5,Ahead of their time,"Forget Harvey Danger, Barenaked Ladies, Green Day and a host of others. NONE of them would exist without the profound influence of groundbreakers like Too Much Joy. TMJ made better records (especially Son Of Sam I Am and ...Finally) but this early work is essential to own for the genesis of it all; and it's fun in its own right. The bonus tracks prove these guys have more TRUE punk in their little fingers than their disciples have in their entire styled-for-MTV-bodies."
4,Letters From Father Christmas,JRR Tolkien Letters From Father Christmas - This was a fun read and the illustrations are wonderful. It must have been fun to get these letters each year.
5,Excellent Read for a Tolkien Fan!,I purchased this book for a huge Tolkien fan as a Christmas gift. The recipient enjoyed every page of the book.
4,A terrific present!,"My family makes a tradition of reading this book, and I thought to give this to a friend. Her family loved it--definitely recommend it, as a gift or simply to enjoy yourself."
5,A must for anyone who still has an imagination,"Tolkein wrote these letters to his own children as if they were coming from Santa Claus at the North Pole. They are sweet, funny, obviously done with great love. There are sketches to illustrate. I've had mine for many years and give them as Christmas presents often and continue to make rereading it a part of getting into the Christmas spirit."
2,Was not what I thought.,"I expected this book to be a collection of stories, as it was described. I was not expecting the book to be literally, just letters. I know the stories came from letters, but I thought all of them would be stories, rather than responses to letters from the author's children.I wanted something I could read my kids, but this won't get the job done. They do not want to hear letters to other kids in response to letters those other kids wrote. In fact, the story portion is not that large...The stories are few and far between. Some letters do not say much of anything.I just wish these were stories 'written by Santa' instead if, so simply, letters."
2,A fantastic collection tragically edited short,"My father's copy remains one of my favorite Christmas books, but when I bought this planning on reading it to my children, I hadn't noticed that many of the letters were cut short without any warning or explaination.If you plan on buying this FANTASTIC book, avoid the version with fold out letters enclosed within. All the letters are cut down to one page, regardless of their original length."
3,Beautiful illustrations,"Great book,beautiful illustrations but think it would be more effective in paper format to really appreciate the drawings and letters"
4,Letters from father Christmas is holiday fun,A delightful look into a writer's connection to his growing family. Short and sweet notes with plenty of humor. I shared with my classes at school.
4,STAPLES,Good quality and construction if staples. Package arrivd taped together with about a fourth of the staples missing but that is about average anymore.
3,Good selection but maybe to many milongas,"This album is supposed to be a tango dancing compilation, but actually it has more milongas and quick dances than formal tangos, is not bad if you like argentinian music, but you might expect more tangos."
5,Amazing tool for PPD,"Even if you aren't interested in the clinical side of PPD, this book is a must have for every pregnant woman/new mom. The assessment at the back of the book is worth every penny. I have purchased one for every pregnant woman I know."
4,Informative and helpful,I got this for a friend of mine who was having a tough time as a new mom. She said that this was really helpful and it got her through the worst of it and helped her talk to her husband about it.
2,Not good for working moms,We got this book for my wife who is dealing with depression. This book made it worse for her. She said it is for stay at home moms.
5,Why didn't I get this book sooner??!!,"I love this book! It gave me so much insight on PPD and all the different ways I could help myself and get the professional help I needed. It also helped regain my relationship with my husband! I would reccommend this book to every woman who is pregnant. It's good to know what to look for as far as symptoms go, that way you can get help sooner. I was in denial for several months thinking I would ""snap out of it"". This IS an illness, and can be treated!! I still have bad days, but they are fewer and farther between. On the bad days I just pick up this book and go to one of the earmarked pages on self help therapy and within a few minutes (instead of hours of crying) I'm feeling better. If you even THINK you might have PPD this is the book to read! It's also great to give to someone who is in denial...they might not appreciate it at the time, but will love you for it later! Good luck to all those women out there going through PPD right now!!!!"
5,This one is a lifesaver,"This book was a definite godsend. I agree with another reviewer that it will not help you to resolve severe PPD, but it will definitely let you know if you need professional help. The exercises are helpful in resolving issues that may be contributing to PPD and the explanations are comforting and supportive. This book let me know that I couldn't do it on my own, that it is not normal to be worried and crying all the time and that I deserve to be happier, which is easier said on this side of PPD. You will not regret buying this book."
4,This IS What I Expected,"If you have it, or think you have it - this book will help you know it. A no nonsense view of the facts as they exist regarding physical changes, the psychological changes and how having this type of depression effects the ENTIRE family. If one spoke in the family wheel changes,EVERYONE changes. Get support, read this book! Know what is happening to you. Remember, this depression is not your choice, however it is real."
5,A great show for kids!,"I got this for my daughter, but I love it, too! :) Great stories about friendship and growing up. The best!"
5,Who doesn't love My little Pony,"The new my little pony series is so popular that it is often difficult to find products.Luckily Amazon always has something new and exciting.Great series with many episodes with Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash and all the other friends.Friendship is Magic series offers stories with lessons that help even the youngest little girl. Colorful and full of songs it is delightful. I am glad Amazon has pre- order so you can get the newest DVDs right when they come out and also they are cheaper than in the store.Highly recommended, even parents will enjoy the My Little Pony DVDs."
2,Mixed reviews,"I have to admit I feel a bit ripped off. I bought it when it first came out as a gift for my daughter. Not knowing the names of the episodes I didn't realize the episodes were from season one and two; only two of the episodes are from the 'new' season. Pretty disappointing. I'm sure if you have read the reviews you realize this, but there weren't reviews before I purchased it. You should buy the seasons instead in my opinion."
5,Unexpected Avenue for Lea,"I'm not really a jazz fan but decided to catch Lea Delaria's show here in DC promoting this new CD. Boy, what a surprise! She was great! I then bought the CD and it was even better. Her voice is very smooth & strong. If you are new to jazz like me, give this a try--you won't be sorry."
5,All That Jazz Indeed,"This CD is one of the finest I've heard in years. Lea Delaria's low sultry alto voice is magnificent. She has masterfully taken all of my favorite songs and jazzed them up to make them even more wonderful than the originals. I have never heard a more inventive version of The Ballad of Sweeney Todd or All That Jazz. You must get this CD, it is phenomenal beyond words."
3,"Poor sound, good songs","Definitely this disc has good songs but the sound is too poor. It's great to hear the Skatalites at the highest volume, but in this case you migth avoid hear the disc so loud. Please, check other alternatives, the sound of this disc only deserves 3 stars."
1,Lo mejor de Jose Alfredo Jimenez,"In case you are unable to listen to the samples, I will tell you that this CD consists of instrumental versions of the songs of Jose Alfredo Jimenez. This CD can be played as background music for dining. Or, if you have the lyrics memorized, you can sing along. Those who want to hear the vivid imagry and striking, colorful lyrics of Jose Alfredo Jimenez must look elsewhere."
5,"Awesome CD you must buy this ""POOP""","I love this cd its so awesome. You must have it. I saw the cover and thought to myself that I didn't wat it at first but, I just said, What the heck, so I bought it. This cd is played everyday when I wake up. I love poop now. I would definetly recommend this to everyone."
1,Disgusting,How can anybody even think about buying a cd that is totally disgusting as this one is. I don't even understand how a music company can allow such trash to even be put out on the market. I would never allow my kids to own this. The cd cover tells me all I want to know about this disgusting piece of trash!!
2,think twice for buying this,"Just received two pens which I ordered two days ago, excellent shipping. But it is definitely not a $250 pen, not worth for $50, should be in $20 range. Poor workmanship."
5,danielle steel's changes,i love the movie and i will continue to buy movies from you and when i fine one i like.
3,Good Movie to Watch at Midnight,"I caught this movie on the WE channel at midnight. It was a tear-jerking and at times annoying movie. I didn't care so much for the quick resolution of everyone making up, however, the twins at the end was an interesting touch. Typical Danielle Steel based movie. I've seen others."
4,Danielle Steele's Changes,"I bought this as a gift, the party was thrilled when they received it. I enjoyed watching it with them. Great service."
1,WARNING: No Chapter/Scene Selection,"I just watched this movie last night and thoroughly enjoyed it. That being said, My review is based on the menu & pause play shortcomings.I paused the movie for ten minutes and came back. When I tried to resume play nothing happened (I should be able to pause a DVD and resume play without any trouble). I had to eject the disk and restart the movie. That is when I discovered THIS DVD DOESN'T HAVE SCENE SELECTION! The only option is to play the movie (from the beginning) and skip chapters to find where you left off. I can't believe anyone would produce a DVD without scene/chapter selections. Even the cheapest DVD's have them. If this very basic feature is important to you, I would wait until this DVD is rereleased with a proper menu."
4,Very enjoyable movie,Very enjoyable and entertaining movie. Realistic view of the hardships faced when blending families. Chery Ladd was great !!
1,Buy HTC instead,"I bought 2 of these bases. On both units, one of the leg posts, which are supposed to be at 90 degrees, had been welded incorrectly. One was so far off you couldn't lower the wheel enough to make the base roll. Also, one of them had a rock jammed into the hollow tubing with paint on it - apparently it was in there for much of the manufacturing process.In addition to lousy quality control, the design is poor, requiring the user to bend over and screw down the stationary legs. Both Delta and HTC bases have foot levers - much more convenient."
1,A very poor product.,"How poor? Until you have had an HTC, you will never know! Also read my review for the Shop Fox Super-Duty model that I tried with distressing results.This Shop Fox Mini Mobile Base could not hold my Drill Press level without shims! Grizzly ought to be embarrassed selling these things to the public."
1,Totally immobile mobile base,"I have three Grizzly products and love all of them, and all have mobile bases. But these ""mobile"" bases are the worst in the industry. Assembling them is a full catastrophe. The holes don't line up and the threads strip and there are far too many bolts... I could go on and on. But the worst of it is that they simply don't roll. The wheels don't caster once there is weight on them, so moving the table saw, drill press or shaper takes the aid of a dolly.Buy Grizzly products, but skip the mobile bases, whatever you do."
2,Idiosyncratic opinions of the author.,This book is very outdated. I would recommend Andrew Skurka’s “The ultimate hiker’s gear guide” for a look at contemporary hiking/backpacking practices.
3,"More from William Gass, but Not Enough","The essays are interesting, varied, well thought out as is always the case with Gass. Certainly a collection was not a a bad idea; thoughts on Robert Walser, Ezra Pound, Nietzsche and more, but the essays were first published as reviews, magazine pieces etc. and so are, on the whole, brief and bright, bits and pieces. One is left feeling a bit undernourished."
2,Yiiich.,"Gass is so cutesy he makes me puke. He consciously seeks to be ""postmodern."" Every sentence is an occasion for another metaphor which serves only to prove how good Gass is at coming up with unusual metaphors. When he reviews the works of others, he preens himself on enjoying their ""subtleties"" like any 4th-rate critic. Ick, ick, what a pri__!The ideas behind the writing are nothing new. Basically the modern world has embraced TV and other media and abandoned literature, and Billy isn't too happy about this. Well, Billy, the philistines aren't listening to you. They can't even understand you. That's why they're philistines. Genuinely strong spirits don't need you to tell them.His sentences strike defeatist-defiant and heroical-stoical poses; seldom could I find any genuine enthusiasm for any pleasure simple or complex. It's all forced and repulsive.For genuine thought-poetry, read the Philosophical Investigations of Wittgenstein, not this literary pretender."
5,Beautifully deceptive piece.,As I am Jewish I thought I'd get my wife a meaningful symbol she could wear and I didn't want to get her a locket or anything like that. So I turned to this and it's been a great piece. She loves it and always gets complimented on it. I say deceptive because it looks like it coast and is worth way more than it actually is. Very beautiful and you cannot go wrong with this one.
4,Great For Price,"I get compliments from this necklace: not too gaudy, not too plain. It comes with a chain that perfectly accents the pendant. It's great for the price, and I love it, but it's obviously cubic zirconia and kind of sharp on the edges. Looks like the picture but slightly less vibrant."
3,Average product,I use these for my cat whose eye constantly tears. I don't think I would buy these again because:1) The liquid in the swab drips. They should either put less fluid in or make the swab bigger.2) Product states not to get any in the eye. Come on ! Can't they come up with a safe formula?3) I have used the towelletts which I think are much better and will go back to that.
2,Typical newer effort by Wyclef,"When you first pop this album in and listen to the intro, you are thrown back to old skool Wyclef. The second song gives you more hope. 24 Hours To Live, is comparable to any track on the Carnaval/Ecleftic, displays soul and deaph of the early Wyclef Ablums. Its that moodness in the beats which give that remenecent sound which made Wyclef famous. However, the album changes dramatically for the worst after that. Almost every song is crapy upbeat Foreign Language version of soething you would be able to find on the Masquerade. Its just not the same Wyclef from the years back. There is one more which is worth mentioning, and that is Vie Ny (Ft Passi), everything else just doesn't make this worth the import price."
2,"I applaud the effort,but","like so many of His Projects after ""the Carnival"" Clef just can't find enough tight material to make a complete set.I dig what he did with taken it back Home,but Musically nothing new is coming through this stew."
3,"Great tasting, but primarily corn syrup","I used this when I lived in New England, but could never find it when I moved to CA. Finally I came across this, and was stoked to have this again. Absolutely delicious on so many things. But then I read the label ... first ingredient, corn syrup. Now I have to use this very sparingly."
2,Not so,This sauce claims that it makes chinese style barbecue spareribs so I was excited that I wouldn't have to buy out so often if I had some on hand. Turns out it tastes nothing like what you get at the chinese place. Very disappointed.
1,STINKS,"I bought this. I paid 69.99 at a local ACE. After a light rain, the second day after I bought it, it collapsed and I could not fold it up because it was bent. STAY AWAY FROM THIS JUNK!"
1,Translation,This book reads like an excellent translation from the work of a so-so contemporary French poet trying to sound like an American.
5,Poetry at its very best...,"I finished the book this morning....literally couldn't put it down. Breathtaking. Engaging. Funny. Horrific. All-so-true. The eliptical style and interweaving of conversations come to a heartbreaking and honest conclusion. I began rereading it immediately once I reached the end, and felt the solidity in the confluence of voices apparent from the first page. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.... I can only rave. CD is able to (believe it, it's true) sustain tension, warmth, humor, and heartbreak through this epic to the very end.CD's writing is definitely ""of the earth"" grounded in the physical as well as in the spiritual. The book: a single poem is worthy of the highest acclaim and prizes.... This book is destined to be a classic."
3,Kindle Review,"The greek text is quite small. It appears to be within a frame so when you try to enlarge it, only the latin letters get bigger. The Greek letters are about the same size as kindles smallest font. If you can read books at the smallest font setting then you should not have any problem.This book is quite helpful. It ""does what it says on the tin"". It has all the important tables with a few concise notes on each. It's the kind of thing you would like to have on hand for quick reference.My main problem with this one is the price. I thought it was a bit too expensive for an ebook that I could flick through in minutes. The Kindle book of tables to go with Mounce's book costs a few euro less. I didn't buy that one because I hadn't used the Mounce textbook but it is the equivalent product and the price of this one should be brought down to match it."
2,Bad stuff,"Growing up, I was exposed to a good deal of Gordon Lightfoot from my parents. No Lightfoot album got played more than this. It might explain why I dislike Lightfoot today. His folksy ramblings and easy-to-mock voice are slight annoyances. If you combine them with a horrid must-be-the-'80s adult contemporary sound, you got something bad: this album. While some tunes are passable, like ""Tag Along"", others sound dated as all out. Most offensive are ""Stay Loose"", ""You Just Gotta Be"", ""Ecstasy Made Easy"". The WORST tune on here has got to be ""Anything For Love"", with the worst elements of a/c: faceless synths, back-ups, and the rest. It was co-written with David Foster, which would explain the track's similarities to his icky Love Theme from St. Elmo's Fire. If Lightfoot had a worst album ever, it would be this one."
1,Poor reliability,"I have five different LaCie Big/Bigger Disk drives, from this the 1 TB version down to 500 GB versions, and 2/3rds of them have had some sort of failure as follows: 1) external power brick going bad, 2) FW800 ports going bad on 1 TB Bigger Disk, 3) bad drive (one of the two 250 GB drives in the Big Disk 500 GB version), 4) extremely loud noise (a Big Disk 500 GB version), 5) included firewire cable going bad.Basically, anything and everything that can go wrong has gone wrong in these drives.Naturally, all of these failures occurred after expiration of warranty. A new power brick from LaCie is $75.For a failed disk, I put in a brand new WD and reformatted and the RAID recognized the ""foreign"" drive.The fact of the matter is, from my experience, though aesthetically pleasing, are absolute JUNK. The failure rates for such a critical item (data storage) is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE. And it's not just one particular component."
1,"Poor performance, no warranty","I have purchased 10 of these drives, all at once. What a mistake. They are very flakey and will 'disappear' while copying data to them by usb. You have to turn the drive off and back on for windows to find it again. I do not have this problem with any other usb drive only Lacie drives. You cannot use one as a backup for this very reason, copying large amounts of data will fail and you have to start over or copy in chunks.One drive failed after 8 months, only at the 10 month mark did I realize it was still under warranty. It had a 1 year warranty so 2 months left, I contacted lacie and after asking for a copy of the original invoice which clearly listed the purchase date they began ignoring my email and would not honor their warranty, no RMA after requesting one 5 times, no more email responses since they could not come up with a reason to refuse service. Do not buy one of these, there are many drives with longer warranties that are more reliable from better companies."
1,So loud that it is unusable,"Yes, it is blazingly fast. Yes it is a tun of storage for below the magic $1/GB mark. Yes it looks good.It is so LOUD that you won't be able to stand being in the same room with it. If you are planning on recording any audio or video (w/ sound) in the same room as this drive, you had better change plans. This thing is LOUD. I have never owned any disc drive anywhere near as loud. It is too LOUD to be in the same room with.LaCie customer support has not responded to any of my inquiries.Please don't do as I did and ignore the reviews that complain of the LOUD noise. If you will have to spend any time in the same room as this drive - take a pass and buy something else. You will not be able to stand being in the same room with this LOUD monster."
1,"Undependable, noisy drive, poor support",This drive suffers from repeated Delayed Write File errors. Ultimately it means you WILL lose all the data on it.It is extremely noisy to the point of damaging your hearing.Lacie support is poor.AVOID!
1,Not reliable. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!,"Failed a couple months past the 1 year warranty. Inexcusable. Storage devices of this size capacity are NOT disposable.(note: the drives inside the case are fine, the failure is apparently in the power supply or usb connection. If yours has failed, at least save yourself the internal drives as they are likely fine; it is lacies crappy case hardware that is likely at fault.)"
4,I always enjoy JAK,"My favorite theme of the book is that our heroine's faith in the hero makes him watch out and care for his extended family, even though he wants nothing to do with them, he doesn't want to disappoint her either."
1,"""P"" FOR PREDICTABLE","This has got to be one of the most banal, poorly written books that I have read in ages. The entire plot was laid out in the first couple of chapters, and the dialogue was horrendously trite. If I had to read the words ""just like a Gilchrist..."" one more time, I think I would've thrown this cheap paperback ouff of my balcony. Family Man had all of the makings of a good, solid romance, but it fell short somewhere in the first part of the book. If you pick this one up, please, I beg you, don't expect much"
5,One of my favorite JAK book!!!,"I've had this book for the longest time but it's one of the only books that has left a lasting impression on me and I've re-read it many times and it's still good! It's Jayne Ann Krentz at her finest! Luke is sexy and so hot and he looks out for Katy and tries to protect her, which is so damn sweet! If you haven't read this book, go out and get it right now~!"
4,Hot and heavy with a good dose of mystery.,"I'm a fan of JAK and this book is one I'd read again. I like the way the heroine got the hero to care about his family. The only problem I have with the book is that it resembles a lot of her previous stories (ex. the heroine is usually a red-head with green eyes, the hero has black hair with green eyes and is a consultant). I hope she changes her story lines in future."
4,Written in 1992 and charging $17.44 for the Kindle version is a RIP!!!,"HOW can they charge $17.44 for the kindle version of this book when it was written in 1992!! I know this is a reprint but at that price!!!! I'm tired of finding books that I think are new, buying them and then finding out that I've read them or they're from the 80's, 90's, etc.... Enough of this!!!"
4,A Keeper,I really enjoyed this book. I have read it before & it still keeps my interest. Strong lead male/female. Interesting secondary characters. It's interesting from the first page. No lag time in this story.
3,Could have been better...,I am one of Krentz fans and love all her books. But I was disappointed. The author kept using same sentences again and again and there was nothing fascinating as I could find in most of her other books. I am still her fan but I don't want to recommend this book to my friend.
5,It Gets No Better Than This For Modern Romance!!!,"Katy Wade has a brother finishing high school. To support him, she has been the personal secretary to the Gilchrist family for almost a decade. At last she is ready to start her own business. First she must lure Luke Gilchrist home to take over the Gilchrist empire. Not an easy task, since Luke holds a life long grudge against them. The Gilchrist empire will fall without him. Luke has the magic touch of how to make money. Once Katy lures Luke home to do his ""family duty"" she can get on with her own life.Katy's attempts to bring Luke back succeeds more than anyone would have suspected. But Luke has plans of his own for this stubborn and loyal lady.This is the BEST Modern Day Romance I have EVER read. A match of wits, love, and family loyalies. A wickedly wonderful tale.by Detra Fitc"
1,"Deceptive pictures, mediocre comforter","My experience was similar to that of the first poster. The material is much rougher, and different in texture and color, from that of the pic. The inside of the comforter feels like burlap. The whole ensemble seems cheaply made, particularly the pillow covers. The bed skirt is a solid gold color. Despite the Amazon 'discount' I feel I could have gotten a better set for a similar price from my local stores, it's about equivalent to a $30 set. Instead of paying return shipping i'll keep it, but beware purchasing bedding from Amazon!Sadly, this is my first negative experience with Amazon, despite the fact that I order from here often. From now on I will stick to books."
1,so disappointed,I hate the bed skirt. It is not what was shown in the original picture. I went back to the site to see what the original bedskirt looked like and it was replaced with a different photo. The comforter is not horrible and I think if I had a skirt like what was shown in the picture I would have felt better about it. I bet that I will have to return the whole thing. What a hassle. I would like to find some matching sheets. Anything to try to make this thing look better.
2,"I always liked ""I want to be your Man.""","Unique sound. Something about the time ;the way it rings true to my ear.Not the best music in the world, but I always liked : ""I want to be your man."""
2,"Important in quilt history, but don't believe a word she says","This book remains important in the history of quilt studies, as one of the first to examine American quilt history, but it is absolutely ridden with romantic myths and errors. Don't take anything she says as gospel. Her assertions, completely unfounded and undocumented, have been repeated endlessly in books on quilts of the Colonial Revival (30s-40s) and the quilt revival (70s-today), but it doesn't make them true. Be very, very cautious in quoting her or in assuming that anyone quoting her later on, knows what they are talking about."
3,Guns of the Wild West,"A very good book.Full of interesting facts.Could have been a bit more comprehensive, but its a must have for any western ethusiast."
5,Great to do business with,I found the product to be of high quality and the delivery time was very fast and well pack. I used this product and very pleased with the proformance. It was a great experience doing business with the seller too.
5,A bit sloppy,"The playing is a bit sloppy, coming from the stature of the Wiener Philharmoniker, at least in the Coriolan Overture, the three pizzicato chords before the end of the piece were not played in unison, as they should have been. I checked with the music score."
4,American and Vietnam: War and Anti War,"This is a remarkable, ambitious book that portrays America during the Vietnam War, both in battle and on the home front, by detailing the events of several days in October, 1967. The book describes the events as a battalion of American troops are ambushed in Vietnam, while at the same time a huge anti war demonstration degenerates into a riot in Madison, Wisconsin.The author is working on a very large canvas, with large sets of characters at each of the book's locations, and I found myself often referring to his list of characters to be certain who was who. The battlefield scenes are some of the most graphic and realistic I have ever encountered.I do think the book suffered when it cut away from Vietnam back to the college kids protesting in Madison. Their concerns, while valid, seemed pretentious and paled in comparison to those of the soldiers under fire."
3,Half is good,"Half of this book deals with combat action in Vietnam. I didn't do any check for accuracy but it looks reasonable and is well written. The other half deals with protest against the war at U. Wisconsin and ranges from boring to extremely annoying. An example of the latter is when after a chapter describe combat actions in which many US soldiers were killed the new chapter is entitled ""A tragedy beyond words"". What do you think it is about?It's mostly about war protest at U. Wisconsin and police intervention.I am glad I didn't pay for this book."
3,"Don't miss the ""rest of the story""","This book is decent - other reviewers have done a pretty thorough job of noting its positives and negatives. But don't miss the ""Rest of the Story"".If you want to read about what it was actually like to be IN the ambush which Maraniss describes, also get a copy of Sgt. Mike Troyer's ""A Gathering of Warriors: A Forgotten One in Me"", ISBN 1425100317, recently published and available from Amazon. Troyer was interviewed by Maraniss and is mentioned on many pages (see the Maraniss book's index).Troyer's book isn't preachy or manipulating or political or whining - just factual, written in the language of real people, and absolutely riveting from cover to cover. It is very easy to read and not at all long-winded; you can do it in a day. Published in small quantities so the price is higher than for volume sales, but worth every penny, and then some. BUY BOTH of these books, read Troyer's first, and then read the one by Maraniss. It sure gives you another perspective."
5,"A Month of Sadness, October 1967","A tale of two sadnesses, or maybe three or even four.In October of 1967, three things were going on:In VietNam the Black Lions a famous battalion of the reknown First Infantry Division (the Big Red One). Commanded by Lt. Col, Terry Allen Jr. (son of Gen. Terry Allen, the commander of the Big Red One in WW II.) the Black Lions walked into a trap that would kill Lt. Col. Allen, among many others.In Madison, Wisconsin, the students at the University of Wisconsin (where Dick Cheney was a graduate student. were staging a protest against Dow Chemical company being allowed to recruit on campus. The sit in turned violent.On the other side of the trap in Viet Nam was Vo Minh Triet, the deputy commander of the Viet Cong First Regiment. He later remarked, ""No one won that day.""Finally, no less sad, President Johnson who had such great hopes to establish a Great Society found his presidency torn apart by Viet Nam.This excellent book is history from a different point of view."
4,Fighting Vietnam in America and in Asia,David Maraniss does an excellent job in taking the reader back in time. His account of two major events in the Vietnam War that took place on back to back days a world apart is well told. The news of the Ambush of the American soldiers in the jungles of Vietnam was just reaching America the following day when the students at the University of Wisconsin were striking a blow for the anti-war movement here in America. Mariniss puts you in the jungle and on campus. An excellent read.
4,Maraniss book,Good book. I had read some other books by same author and enjoyed them. This book does not disappoint. Good read.
1,Who the heck is Brad anyway? These nails SUCK!,"I don't know what the rest of the reviewers were using their nails for, because I couldn't even get them to go into my wall, let alone hold something up with them. Every time I tried to pound one in, it just bent in half! After using these sorry excuses for fastening devices, I have only one word: SCREWS!"
3,Paco's arrangement of traditional Spanish tunes,"In too many notes to be described here, in Mi Historia Paco De Lucia shows us again how well he combines technique and expressiveness with tasteful composition and arrangement. The recording features many traditional Spanish tunes (as well as some of his own) but he presents them with great passion (which is his trademark!)."
1,Imcomplete Book,"The book was incomplete, the text begins on page four, so pages one through three are lacking, and there is no meaning in the first parts of the book"
4,Nice easy read!,"Nice, easy and quick read about a woman's self discovery, determination and the love of a good man in rugged country of Oregon.Enjoyable, though it would have been better if the lives of the characters and their thoughts were better detailed. Would like to know more.This is a sequel to Wildwood by Lynna Banning."
4,Definitely an old classic,"Like many British Aerodynamicists, I was taught the basics of aerofoil and wing design using courses based on this book. It covers much the same ground as Prandtl and Tietjens, but in a much clearer fashion. Of particular interest is the development of lifting-surface theory for finite wings using Fourier analysis.Although most of what is contained in this book has been overtaken by new technology, the strength of the analytical approach shown here is that it gives the reader a better intuitive handle on the sensitivities of different parameters in the design problem."
4,Good!,"This is a good introduction to Reformed theology aka ""Calvinism. It may not necessarily be the best book if you are looking for ""proof texts"" or help in defending the doctrines of grace, as I'm sure there are books that more skillyfully defend the doctrines of grace, but this book is at least a good starting point. It may introduce the concepts in a way that is more gentle and ""learnable"" than some of the more ""heavy duty"" books."
4,"Beautiful movie, beautiful music","This CD features the debut recording for Salvatore Licitra who proves to be a tenor to look out for in the future. Combined with the powerful voice of Licitra, this CD contains tracks of traditional roma (gypsy) music. Rent/buy the DVD/Video, watch the movie and then buy the CD - you won't regret it."
5,The Man Who Cried,"The music in this movie is so beautiful, it's almost haunting. I have watched the movie 4 times in the past 3 days and can hardly get enough of it. I was not a fan of Johnny Depp's until now. Salvatore Licitra's voice is incredibly beautiful. I can't say enough."
4,The Man who Cried,"Beautiful music, some of the best tenor arias from Italian opera, sung perfectly, and then South American music from heaven. I recommend this (hard to find) disc to all."
4,Rose Among the Thorns,I wasn't expecting so many instrumentals and 'When I Am Laid in Earth' was a disappointment but Licitra's arias are well worth the price.'Je Crois Entendre Encore' is much better here than on the 'Duetto'CD.Glad I bought this.
4,Mathematics for Biologists,"is very easy and the reading is fast, beautiful.The chapters are focused to really problems from biologyst andmolecular biologyst or medical doctors."
3,"A reader from Baltimore, MD","Well written guide to the basics such as concentrations, dilutions, logs etc. with lots of useful worked examples. The only problem is the book is a bit too basic for all mathematic needs during a biological degree."
2,I still don't like biographies,"I usually don't like biographies, but I gave this book a fair chance. I found it to be mostly dull, and I didn't feel any of the urgency or levity that I would have expected. I didn't live in this era, however, I knew the names and faces of some of the big players. I spent the whole time I read this book wondering why this guy?If you like books that take forever and never end, check this one out."
5,Whittaker Chambers,This book becomes hard to put down as the courtroom spy/perjury dramas evolve and unfold.Highly recommended for anyone interested in the period preceding and through the early part of the Cold War.
3,Left me yearning for more,"I love Whitburn's books--I have almost all of them, and the rest get 5 stars, especially Songs/Artists 2007. I felt that he took lazy shortcuts because the tracks were listed only for the albums that hit the Top 10! What is that, less than 15%! How am I going to find the songs on the REST of the charted albums, oh I know, SUBSCRIBE to his internet archive service. I tried that and it is impressive, but not worth the $20/month for me. This is more of a disappointment than a bad thing, Whitburn is a genius and will continue to be for years!The chance he'll ever update that to include all the tracks from all the albums: the same chance that President Bush will allow the Iraq War to be ended by the year 2006.By all means, order the Whitburn books, just avoid this one."
4,"Good for the basics, but not of the two currently supported versions.","This is a great book for the basics of 4D. It includes a CD of a demo program and sample databases. Unfortunately, it covers version 6.7, which is obsolete- the only currently supported versions are 2004 and v11 SQL. And 4D has announced it will no longer support v2004. Still, many things you will learn from this book and v6.7 will transfer to later editions. Now if only someone will write a beginners book for v11 SQL."
2,Pale shadow of Geoff Ayling's book,"Again and again the author here refers to Geoff Ayling'sbreathtaking book ""Rapid Response Advertising"", which isout-of-print and hard to come by ($$).There's not nearly as much depth here. If you aren't surewhat a meme is or how the idea could help you in marketingyour business, this book might give you a clue, but ifyou are an advertising pro, skip it and get Ayling's bookand read that instead."
3,like so not worth it,"Okay so my friend gave me this book because she knew I wall like into starting my own web business but I like didn't know where to start and then I knew that I needed help but this book kinda sucked because it wasn't really relevant. So this other friend gave me this book Guerrilla PR Wired. Now, this was the book. It had everything I needed and it was so totally cool that I couldn't really figure out why no one else had read it yet. Like everyone is so missing out if they don't use this book because it has everything you need including how to do everything you want and not go broke."
4,Nice snapshot of Brazil,"Great imagery of Brazil, but annoying when people speaking Portuguese are ""dubbed over"" into English, subtitles would be preferred. The video completely fills a 16:9 widescreen TV (no black bars). The DVD defaults to 2.0 stereo playback. Unusual that you have to enter your DVD player menu to play the 5.1 surround soundtrack. There are no setup options on the DVD menu."
3,It Works...,"Works great as far as charging. Just keep an eye on it as the one that I got, the light didn't turn from red to green when it was done charging. Other than that, great replacement charger."
5,"10,000 used and NEVER a problem","I used these in a Senco brad nailer to install 3/4"" cedar in a walk in closet as well as to install 2400 square feet of 3/4"" pine v-groove in the ceiling of my dome home and they worked perfectly. Although I tried to avoid knots there were some situations where I had no choice but to go through them and the brads worked fine when using the turbo setting. I have a finish nailer and a pin nailer as well and B&C Eagle is the only brand I use because I know for a fact that when I use them there will not be any problems."
3,holds wood well,Honestly i can't say they are better or worse than any other i have used. they work.
1,Brad Nails,"The box was torn apart (probably a return product sold as ""NEW"")and nails strips were a mess. Strips were broken into mutiple smaller strips and a large portion didn't sit correctly in the gun (a lot of misfires) . I will go elsewhere for my finishing nail purchases."
1,Inferior Quality,Go to Home Depot and buy the Porter Cable brads - they have a wider head and are less expensive also.
2,i think it doesn't work in PS3,I love this game but in my PS3 the game is obstructed continuosly and i can't finish
2,Not as advertised,"The item that was described when I bought it was a PC-DVD game. The one that was received was a PC-CD, so image quality is therefore not near as good as what it could be."
1,This game does not work on PS3s and blu ray player,I tried to play this DVD/game on both of my updated PS3s. Failed both times cycling through the same graphic non-stop. I then tested this DVD/game on a Sony stand-alone player and got the same result. It failed again. Consider yourself warned and avoid the headache of returning merchandise.
2,Game doesn't work well,I really would like this game if it didn't have so many problems. First I had to download patches for the game to make it work. Then it still would freeze up on me on certain parts of the game. Once it froze I had to start all over again. So I emailed Digital leisure and all they could tell me is I could buy a DVD attachment. I think they should have gave me a better answer than that. I also got dragons lair but that worked fine.
4,No problems,We use alot of different hardware in our business. I was able to find a not so common piece of hardware quite easily and at a good price.
5,Excellent Study of the British Crown Jewels,"This video contains a colorful and realistic description of the crown jewels of England, including their history and the specific purpose and origin of each piece of the regalia. The backdrop for the presentation includes scenes from the coronations of Queen Elizabeth II and previous British monarchs."
2,Fills in the picture,"This book says it's a system administrator's guide. Since I'm not a sysadmin but more of a hacker with Linux, I found lots of details seemed to be glossed over. If you are looking for a high level explanation of making Linux work with a Windows network, this book is for you. Most Linux books seem to assume you know more than you (I) do. I haven't found any one Linux book that tells me everything I need to know to get some server running, such as Samba. This book adds to the picture. It would be good to use with other books."
4,Great Linux/Windows Integration Reference,"This book did not favor any one Linux OS over another (good). Most Linux configuration was via commandline (which most will advocate in a Unix environment) and direct editing of conf files. Each chapter has a great balance of common practices, breaking down the common config parameters, then implementing. Overall, a great reference."
5,If you need Biotin.. this is it,"Pros: 5mg ( most are 2, or 3mg ), cheapCons: Does it really show a difference?I bought Biotin mainly for my nails. I can truely say.. I think.. it works. I bite my nails nonstop and when i started using it i felt my nails were growing back faster and harder. It is great tha t this is 5mg and not a 3mg bottle. The only recommendation I have since this sells directly from swanson, is to buy more than one to save on shipping."
5,Thicker Hair,"Love love this biotin. Makes my hair so much thicker, takes a month or so, but it really makes a difference. Other people have noticed, so it's not my imagination."
1,expired,ordered 3 bottles this in April 2012 and just noticed this morning that all 3 have an expiration date of 01/11.
3,I found this book to be fairly enjoyable,I thought this book was pretty good. It held my interest enough to read the whole thing. The characters were ok but the hero was a bit annoying at times with his stubborn ways. It was a worthwhile 2-day read.*****MINOR SPOILER AHEADI was disappointed though that the history of Ghost Dancer before she was found by the tribe wasn't covered at all. We knew her name was Angelique but what about her family? Didn't she have any memories of them?
1,19th century America,"This sounds like such a wonderful thesis, but sadly, the author forgot to do his homework. I hope someone else can explore the subject with greater fortitude so that American citizens can learn the facts about their nineteenth-century nation."
5,Awesome Expansion,This is an amazingly fun expansion to an already awesome game!Great value too! This expansion pack adds fun content - while still keeping the game fast paced.
5,Very fun expansion,We love playing BANG! Especially with a big group of people. This expansion adds some fun twists and allows you to play with up to 15 or 16 people. Great gift!
5,it's the best!,This game is insane! hot cars like fast and the furious or somthing! it's great! for this price you get what you pay for. Hope you buy it it's so worth it!
1,"Racing on freeways, what fun is that?!","I thought this game deserves one star because the gameplay is fu***** cheap. The only race mode is race on the freeway, it gats real old, real fast. The only thing I find fun is the ways you can customize your car, but that is pretty much it.Also this game does not deserve to be $25, it should be free."
1,TXR2 ..................Not so great !,TXR2 has a lot of good features but some major problems :1. cars don't turn well2. too realistic3. dosesn't gie you that intense racing feel4. painting and modifing your car is hard5. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BORING !!!!!!!You would be happier with a game like Crazy Taxi or Jet Grind Radio . Don't waste your $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ !!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,A Gem of the World's Spiritual Heritage,"This is a nice little introduction to one of the world's forgotten religions. There's nothing complex about this little volume of spiritual texts. Basic precepts of Zoroastrian belief are explained and numerous quotations and prayers are given. There are hints of the influence of Zoroastrian belief upon Jewish and Christian thought. Leaving one to wonder what the world would be like if the Parsian faith were more widespread. My only complaint is that I wish it were more indepth, but have to remember it was written in 1908 and was probably a rare volume in its day."
4,Understanding Crystals For Young Children,I used this book with a second grader. She had no difficulty understanding the text and memorizing key concepts. I followed up by having us grow crystals. It was a memorable experience for her and a great introduction to scientific concepts at a young age.
2,Just the basics,We purchased this for my 14-year-old granddaughter who had a science project. The book was quite elementary for her and covered various types of crystals. Think it's best for younger audiences.
4,What a good writer he is.,"This book inlcudes the first short stories of the characters from ""Jim the boy"" and ""Blue Star"". Since I'm a big fan of those books, it was interesting to read his first takes at those characters. His other stories show a different side of the writer. He writes of modern characters in very adult situations. He's a very observant, realistic writer, who can subtly capture a character's emotional essense in a small act. I don't know many writers who can disclose the truth about average people more artistically than Earley."
4,Nice tool,Nice tool in General. The plier is very handy and it comes with a nice case. The knife is ok but not great. Bottom line a good tool for a good price.
1,Poor Quality Nails for the Porter-Cable Finish Nailer,"These nails are not of the quality necessary for the Porter-Cable Finish Nailer that they are typically advertised with (FN250A). They sometimes came out 2 at a time, not at all, or caused the nailer to jam. I called Porter-Cable, and acquired their nails, and the problems went away. I would not recommend these nails, especially for this nailer."
4,They're nails - not much to say,"I bought these along with a Porter Cable air nailer for some trim work in a remodel project. What can I say? They seem to hold well, and I haven't had a jam after nailing up a couple hundred feet of trim. The bad -- like most things ""made in China."""
1,uh what?!,"If you're a beginner at learning german,like me, you will find this book totally useless. You never even really learn the alphabet,let alone phrases. The cd is of little help because it starts right off with phrases before you can even learn the vocabulary! It tries to teach you the vocabulary, but how do you pronouce it when the book provides little help? It left me feeling frustrated, scratching my head, and trying, without prevail, to figure out what it meant."
3,Could be Much Better,"I have generally found language books of this nature to be disappointing but before heading to Vienna, I took a gamble that this book/text may be better. I was once again left unimpressed. Although I can see its potential, the book tries to be too many things all at once and it would be nigh impossible to gain any real benefit, let alone language ability, out of it. Although I have not studied German since, I recently spotted ""Ultimate Living German"" which looked very good so I may try it once again.Even if you want to study only a little German before embarking on a holiday, I am sure there must be better books than German for Dummies. It will only make you confused, frustrated and out of pocket. For those who want to study German seriously, then this is definitely not for you (even for the beginner).Viel Glueck!"
3,Good as a reference book,"This book does a decent job at teaching you some basic vocabulary, though it does have a lot of list of random words that would take a while to memorize for their usefulness. Its got pretty good grammar explanations and charts for how to modify the endings and how to change pronouns depending on what case they take. You learn some conversational german, but not a ton. Now i just use this as a refference book for looking up how to change der, die, and das (the) according to the case of the word and other stuff like that. Its not really great though for use other than that"
2,Should have bought German demystified...,"In the past I purchased the German Demystified and I was able to follow along and I found it to be a very nice studie guide. after a few years I misplaced the book and went out to find another. With that in mind I figured most of these kinds of books are the same and so I purchased German for Dummies and I am completely unhappy with it. It's just not very clear to me and there is to much extra nonsense thrown in the material. I was reading up on the reflexive nouns and the examples I thought were just poor. These examples simply left me with more questions then I had before reading the chapter. They needed to include more examples and they shoul dhave been easier to understand! So, here I am paying for yet another book (German Demystified) because this book just doesn't do it for me."
3,It not easy to learn a foregin language.,"As a non- English speaker, there is a hindrance for me to use this book. It might be the reason that I don't have the talent for learning German. The way it teach pronunciation is not accessible for me. After all, it still useful in the dialogue part, because it contains audio CD for listening."
5,Great service,"After a little mix-up on the initial order, this vendor made it right with flying colors! I would definetly do business with them again. They stood behind their product 100%."
3,A text book,It is informal in the sellings of the words but the dictionary is not helpful. Their pronoition guide is not very organised. It is more like a high school text book
1,Don't buy it,"I have an MA in German. This book has at least seven (7) errors in the German text and exercises. I was quite disappointed because I liked the Dummies series software books and found them to be helpful...but really, errors in the German--and they were spelling errors to boot"
1,Horrible like all the for dummies language books,A waste of money. I speak some German having lived there for a little bit. I picked this over other books because of the cd.Not well organized no real lessons. It is the same with the Dummies Japanese book. A fairly useless book. Just really phrases with no seeming relationship to each other the chapters don't build on each other. No lessons to help you get the words and phrases into your head.I would never buy another dummies book again. The changing from pc to mac and the snow lepoard books were no help to me either.I believe my copy was an earlier edition but I doubt this is better.The idiot series is much better.This book is the book I would buy now.German Made Simple: Learn to speak and understand German quickly and easilyHas all you want.
5,Erasure's First... True Album,"I love ""Wonderland"", but consider it to be way too similiar to Yazoo (which Clarke had just came from). So ""The Circus"" is really the album that begins to give us a good understanding of Erasure - the band. From the hip ""It Doesn't Have To Be"" to the soft ""Spiralling"", this album has it all. And it is actually a concept album of all things. There's hints in the music from ""Don't Dance"" to ""Spiralling"" that lead all back to the actual song ""The Circus"". What I love about Erasure, is that they often have a number of songs on each album that are just as good as their singles or better. ""Hideaway"", ""Leave Me To Bleed"" and ""Spiralling"" are tracks that were never heard on the radio, but they are three of my favorite tracks from the album. There are hits as well like ""Sometimes"" and ""Victim Of Love"". If you are interested in Erasure and don't have this album, get it. You won't be disappointed."
5,Erasure albums are timeless - classic from the start,"I just can't stop listening to Erasure songs, during work, workout, in the car, in the house.. I just can't stop. They are one of my favorite band to keep me going when I am in a rut. They are so talented, each and every song is a work of art. AMAZING!"
2,Mistaken identity/excessive artificial bass,"I purchased this item from Amazon's SACD section and when it arrived as a regular cd I was more than a little disappointed. Than I played it and it had even more of what hooked me when I sampled the disc on Amazons website. But, and this is a big but, the samples as heard on my laptop don't prepare you for the overbearing, plodding, and wholly artificial bass on this disc. I like big rich bass in my blues/jazz just as much (if not maybe even a little more) than the next person, but the bass on this disc sounds so fake and at the same time so overbearing as to ruin an otherwise fantastic moody mix. I sure would like to hear a remastered SACD without the amateurish syntheticly enhanced bassline. The music is quite enjoyable."
2,Should be called Sit-N-Squeak,"It does everything it claims to be. The construction seems a little flimsy, but it is meant to be portable and lightweight. Would rate it 4 stars except that it squeaks. It's got plenty of lubrication on it and it still squeaks. Its squeak is irritating even through a set of earplugs and earphones playing music. The squeak makes it unusable. I'm going to return it."
2,Poor Recording quality,"The teachings of Eckhart Tolle are based on universal truths which the student will recognize immediately as foundational to finding true peace. This particular CD is filled with the wisdom teachings gathered from other presentations or retreats. While possibly redundant at times, the ever true bears repeating because we forget. The biggest problem with this particular CD is the sound quality. It is very poor and at times Tolle's voice is all but obliterated by the hissing noise of the re-make. It is not audience noise but technical deficiencies which make this CD an unsatisfactory product not up to the standards of Sounds True."
4,This is a live workshop,"I did not see this anywhere in the description, so was unhappy to discover when playing the first time, this is a live workshop recording. I tried to be okay with that, give it a chance, but it lost me nearly immediately. In listening, I nearly jumped out of my chair when a lot of unexpected laughter leapt out at me. Not very peaceful, the effect I was seeking.Ekhart's voice is slower than on other recordings. Being live, one gets to hear the audience laughing, coughing and making the usual audience noises. Combined with his slower-than-usual voice, it was impossible to enjoy. Had I known it was a live recording, I never would have purchased it."
5,Our Spiritual Goal in Plain Terms,"In this CD Tolle provides a succinct summary of the state of mind to be achieved to realize inner peace. He outlines the fallacies of thinking that keep us from that state and describes the benefits when we achieve stillness. His books and other CDs cover the same ground, but with a great detail more explanation and examples. He explains what is wrong with us in plain terms, with light-hearted examples. His message is always the same: stop thinking."
3,"Tolle's ""Open Door""","I am a great Tolle fan & so purchased this new title based on first contact. Not long into the first listen, I started feeling deja vu and after a little more listening it became clear that this book had been excerpted heavily from Tolle's earlier work much of which I already had in my collection. My advice? Be mindful of this when buying this work. It may not add much to your now moment."
5,Great Book!,"I got this book for my young children, who were brought into our family through adoption. After being read the book just a few times, my daughter had most of it memorized and loved talking about what happened in the book (at random times). Many things seemed to really draw her into it, like Mrs. Bear running to help when Choco was sad, the things Mrs. Bear did for Choco like a mommy would do, and that Mrs. Bear's children all looked so different. It was a great choice for our family and I highly recommend it, not just for adoptive families, but for any family. It is a wonderful book to introduce any child to families that may not look like each other and brings up great opportunities to have conversations about that."
5,Big hearts! :-),"I fell in love with little choco! I love how it showed my children that there is someone out there in our world (choco's forrest) that doesn't care what you look like and that your different, and that they can love you. No one is alike even if they are the same nationality. This book is just a fun loving book! I think they did a wonderful job!"
5,adoption stories,"This book is brightly illustrated and will keep the attention of a small child. The story is a good way to help an adopted child understand that families do not have to look like one another or come from the same places. It promotes love and caring, and that is why I bought it."
5,Great for young adopted or foster children,"Sweet story that can be embraced by young children who have been adopted or are currently in foster care. This book also can address families that are diverse in culture, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity.My fost/adopt daughter loves it!"
5,Absolutely Delightful,A Mother For Choco is an absolutely delightful book. I read this book to my Kindergarten class every year and they are always surprised by the ending. A wonderful story for all ages. A true book of acceptance. A winner.
5,"The perfect antidote to ""Are you my Mother?""","Thank you Keiko Kasza for giving adoptive families a simple tale that affirms and celebrates families whose members don't all look the same. Choco worries when he can't find any mothers who look like him, and doubts that a bear could be his mother. But Mrs. Bear, whose children include an aligator and a pig, shows Choco what really makes a mother. Choco chooses her, and that's a great twist too."
2,Racially Insensitive and an Unwanted Child,"As an adoptive mother of a child that is a different race than I am I was appalled by the focus of this book on the child being unwanted by so many because he was different. I am honestly VERY surprised this book received so many glowing reviews. The end has a positive spin bc there is a mother who wants Choco despite his differences bc they have other things in common. In my family we celebrate the fact that we are all different, not love each other in spite of it. I will not read a book to my child that causes him in any way feel like he was unwanted or even that he is blessed bc we were the only ones who wanted him. I do not recommend this book."
2,Wish I could get my money back.,I appreciate any and all artistic attempts toward self-expression. So I don't like to give negative feedback or criticism to an artists work. But I couldn't help disliking this movie. I found myself fast forwarding through the whole thing. The actors themselves were believable. But it didn't seem too believable especially at the end where it didn't seem to wrap up. It had a -watch me make a movie with my camcorder and a few friends in the backyard- kinda feel to it. It wasn't scary at all or thrilling. So calling it horror or a thriller to me would be amiss. The cover led me to choose this since there was no preview option. I wish there would've been. I think I would've passed this one by.
3,Nice Umbrella but.....,"The umbrella works but before you buy it, be aware that Gale Pacific/Coolaroo does not offer replacement parts. I called their customer service to buy a bracket that snapped off and they told me that I should just buy another umbrella. Really? Buy a whole new umbrella for almost $200 when all I need is a bracket? That doesn't speak well for the company. I've never bought something of quality that didn't have replacement parts available for purchase."
2,Great Potential but Fatal Design Flaw,"My family bought one of these umbrellas, but during a rain storm, the wind was apparently too much for the plastic part that serves as the fulcrum, because it broke. It seems from the other reviews that we were not the only ones to have this problem.Our efforts to obtain a replacement part have been unsuccessful. If only they had a stronger, preferably metal, replacement part, this would be an ideal umbrella, especially with it's very reasonable cost.Why such a key part is made of plastic instead of metal when this part is at the key point with the most stress is beyond me. But unless you only use this umbrella when there is no chance for any strong wind, we could not recommend it."
4,Works great!,"Bought for our deck to shade us from late afternoon sun. So far, so good. Easy to use and move as needed. We are happy with the purchase so far. WE've only had it for about a month, so can't comment on how well it holds up........but seems to be good quality fabric."
2,Cheap quality,"The umbrella is great when it is working. However, it just takes a little wind in the wrong direction to completely destroy the plastic parts and the umbrella becomes useless. Mine lasted around 2 1/2 years and there is not much wind here."
2,"Grea concept, part quality questionable","We purchased this item in May 2008 and loved it for about 10 months. Then the couplings that hold/slide the umbrella (which are made of plastic) began to crack. Eventually in the next few months, they cracked through, rendering the umbrella useless as it could not be held in place nor held open. Unfortunately, the company does not make replacement parts and it has been more than 12 months since the initial purchase. We love the umbrella but it's shamefull that either we got a lemon or this is a potential problem with no solution. Since it is out in the hot sun, you'd think the couplings would be made of a sturdier material. KEEP YOUR RECEIPT VERIFICATION!"
4,Nice umbrella,The umbrella post and arm is a little lighter construction than I anticipated but survived a microburst that took down a 24 inch oak 75 feet away - the umbrella was folded at the time - so I guess the construction is okay. There is a plastic clip that holds the arm in place where it passes through the guide at the top of the vertical post. That clip is a bear to engage and disengage. There is a plastic collar that captures the strut where it meets the locking mechanism on the vertical post. It seems cheap but functions okay and is not heavily stressed. Overall this is a nice umbrella for the price.
1,does not work with mac....why?,okay does not work with mac....why? You all know how apple is always trying to make more money. You need a mac or pc but your mac must be OS X so if you have 10.5 or below then you cant run your cd rom on mac you have to buy OS X . It aint cheap at all so make shore you have MAC OS X before you buy this CD rom cause it didnt work for me. THANK YOU APPLE):
4,Beautifully produced Boxset,"There is no doubt that the original ""El Hazard"" is one of the best of American released animes. The comedy is raunchy and clever, the characters are funny and the story finds the touching human element in a wacky sex comedy. Top notch all the way around.""El Hazard 2"" loses the ""clever"" part and just focuses on the ""raunchy."" It is not bad, but it is nowhere near the quality of the original. Worth watching, but not really worth buying on it's own.The boxset itself is the real showcase. It is just so...pretty. The artwork is outstanding, and the whole thing is a real presentation. I am not usually sold by nice packaging, but this one did it for me. A great series, and OK series wrapped up in a fabulous package. Not perfect, but worth having."
4,More brilliance from El-Hazard,"This is the third volume of El-Hazard, and in my opinion it surpasses the first two tapes. The only thing really lacking earlier in the series was a sense of interest in the characters. I enjoyed watching them, but I didn't really feel anything for them as people.This tape makes you care. It is also pivotal in that it introduces Ifurita, the ""Demon God"" with the big chest and the rather shocking penchant for destruction. Jinnai manages to awaken her, and minutes later commands her to destroy the allied nations that are at war with the Bugrom. This she begins to do, by hovering over a large city and obliterating it with a single energy blast. After the lightheartedness of the first tapes, in which no one really got hurt, this was almost disturbing. The drama melds well with the comedy, though, resulting in a series that covers all bases. I highly recommend this tape to all anime fans."
5,This is where Anime begins,"Finally, this true Anime classic has made to DVD.El Hazard is one of the best anime of all time, this show is where the Anime begnins along with Tenchi Muyo.Join all the fans for this beautiful world of El Hazard."
3,Tenchi lovers will enjoy,"If you enjoyed Tenchi Muyo or Tenchi Universe or even the new series, Tenchi n Tokyo...than you'll this series. Similar spoofs, drawing style is also very similar."
5,"Buy it for ""Loneliness"" alone","This is a bargain at only 6 bucks! ""The Loneliness Of A Middle-Distance Runner"" is worth the price of admission alone. Make a bag salad tonight instead of getting takeout and buy this CD."
5,Truly wonderful pop,"Quite a lot of people seem to think that only Stuart M can write great songs. Usually those people also think that Stevie' s songs .... Well, maybe Seymour Stein wasnt so great but The Wrong Girl was. And Jonathan David isnt just great. Its BRILLIANT. Its MAGNIFICENT. Just go and get it. Summer' s coming and this is just the thing!!"
2,Decline and fall.,"This EP is just another chapter in the decline of B&S, which began with ""The Boy with the Arab Strap,"" when, sadly, the non-Stuart Murdoch members of the band began to make their mediocrity felt.The title track is yet another shrugworthy Stevie Jackson trifle, while third track ""The Loneliness of the Middle Distance Runner"" is indeed middling-meandering and rather boring. The second track, ""Take Your Carriage Clock and Shove It,"" shows signs of life, though the lyrics are somewhat subpar and lacking subtlety, and the violin hook is swiped from ""There's Too Much Love"" from their last album. Perhaps they are running out of ideas."
4,Very Happy...But,"Overall, I love this product. I am able to let my 2 year old swim with out me holding him and he is so happy. My only disappointment was that i ordered it in Blue and got it in Purple which was not my first choice for a boy!"
3,Equal opportunity horror,"In the usual teen-slasher flick, all the cute guys get killed off immediately, leaving 70 minutes of girls taking showers and falling out of their nightgowns. Here a girl is still the sole survivor, but the majorly hunky Vincent Van Patton runs around in nothing but boxers for the first hour or so, and 80's teen-idol Peter Barton holds out until almost until the end. There's a plot, too, but who cares?"
4,Childhood Trauma,"I first saw the Trilogy of Terror when I was 3 years old. Why my parents let me watch it I have no idea. While the first two stories are decent psychological thrillers, it was the third story, ""Prey"" that truly disturbed me. I am now 22 and I have been plagued with nightmares my entire life centering around the Zuni hunting fetish that hunts Karen Black in this movie. For some reason this just really got to me. I still find this chapter of the movie the scariest thing I have ever seen in any film. The raw viciousness of the doll, the evil sounds it makes, and the final scene, all are truly horrifying. I nicknamed the doll ""Cut-Out"" as a kid since it cuts it way out of a suitcase in one part. I was curious if anyone else found this movie as frightening as I did. It's something I may never stop having nightmares about. I'd recommend it to anyone, just don't let your 3 year olds watch it."
1,HELL TO WATCH=HELL NIGHT,"The movie Hell Night looked ok so I thought I would give it a try,I'm glad it was a rental,this movie [smelled.] First off it is about a group of kids staying in garth manor to get pledged,it takes 40 minutes or so for anything remotely interesting to happen. The death scenes are bland and suffer from getting edited heavily and plot has been done a year ago with Terror Train in 1980 which is actually a good movie about kids in a frat on a train. FINAL VERDICT:UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE 1 HOUR AND 30 MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE,AVOID THIS...MOVIE..."
2,AWFUL,"terrible movie, especially linda blair purposely shaking her nasty tits everytime the killer pops out. Bad scares, veeeery slow, and NOT at all scary. One of the worst horror films of the 80's."
1,WARNING!,"This is not a review of the movie, but a warning to potential buyers of this item. If you are considering buying this item from Amazon, DO NOT! This movie was distributed by Anchor Bay and is now OUT OF PRINT. Amazon, however is selling DVR copies of this movie. The DVD does include the exact cover art as the original release but includes a dvd with no disc artwork, no insert and is, in fact, a DVR copy which you can tell just by looking at the color of the DVD itself. Official releases have a chrome or sometimes gold tint to the playable side of the disc whereas DVR copies have an almost dark blue tint to them."
4,One of the First!!!!!!!!!!,"Hell Night is an outstanding film, in my eyes it is one of the best slasher movies that was made. I also believe Linda Blair performance was even better than the Excorcist."
3,"Not too bad, considering...","This little un-unique slasher film isn't all too bad. In fact, it's actually a little scary and exciting...Of course, it would end like all teenage horrors: with one girl surviving.A bunch of college kids have to spend the night at a ""haunted"" house for initiation into a fraternity. Naturally, the house really ends up being haunted.For the most part, HELL NIGHT's pace is pretty quick, making for a pleasurable movie viewing..."
3,Great B movie,"The acting is horrible the scenes are dark, but this is still one of the best B horror flicks around."
3,Linda Blair proves herself in another creepy movie,"Hell night is a classic of early eighties horror. Less on the gore and nudity of it's peers but more on mood and genuine scares. It is a simple plot, a few kids have to spend the night in a haunted mansion to get into a sorioity house. But after the typical blood shed at the start it slowly uses the house in an un-nerving way, dark corridors, secret passageways, scary basements. Scoobie Doo was never like this!"
2,Typical 80's Horror Classic,"I don't know if I'm getting older or more jaded, but I thought I remembered this movie as being one of the scariest I had ever seen. Compared to todays films, I do appreciate the understated gore and not as much flesh and fewer trash words. Ahh the good old days. The movie was in good condition."
4,Nice cheezy Blair horror film,"Lot's of gore in this fun horror flick! Lindalooks great in low cleavage period costume. She gives a spirited performance and jumps up and down alot when she gets spooked - check it out!Great chase scene with Linda in awesome cave! Also really cool impalement scene! Good DVD quality. Film has nice look - gothic house with lots of candles! Ifyou like Linda, your gonna like this one - pick it up!!"
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie is kinda scary at some parts, but the death scenes were ridcules! When a girl got decapitated, there wasn't even a good sound effect to go along with it, and she smiled! It sucked! The best death scene is when this guy get his head twisted all the way around. It actually had a good sound effect with it! All in all, this movie deserves a rental, if the rental price is below $2."
4,IS JUST A 80S CALSSIC!!,"I saw this movie back in 80s and I loved it. Put it that way if u grew up in 80s u would love this movie with old fashion style and is classic..But if u grew up in 90s forget this because I am pretty sure u would not like the style and looks of this movie. To me because I grew up in 80s is one of my favorite classic, and I am not going to buy this DVD because I see this movie every year around Halloween repeat in cable channels.so why I waste my money, I see it every year . I just feels soo sorry for Linda Blair, after ""exorcist"" her acting and further went down the drain. , Maybe because she didn't have movie star looks and body. BUT is old fashion Horror film. Is couple of cute guys in it too, if u interested to see.! After all B"
2,Has some good qualities...,"Hell Night is not scary, but it is still entertaining. The charectors (the four in ""Garth Manor"") are likeable, and the mansion is cool and the hidden room with the corpses is neat and creepy. An okay film."
4,Hell Night,"If you like the sometimes ""campy"" horror films of the early 1980's, then you'll love ""Hell Night""! Four young college students must spend the night in a supposedly haunted house for pledge night(a.k.a Hell Night) where a grizzly mass murder took place years earlier. The horror begins when they discover it's not haunted but that the killer is still alive and living in the tunnels that run under the entire mansion. One by one the deformed killer stalks and kills his prey. Starring Linda Blair from ""The Exorcist""(She's much hotter in this film) it's a must see for horror fans!"
2,hell night,"i like the movie but i thought hell night was the original dvd i didnt think amazon would sell me a dvr copy i think that was wrong and dishonest. i will be more leary of buying movies from amazon now.i think they should give me an original copy,that would satisfy me james hiatt."
3,Eight Years After Exorcist,It is a shame that Linda Blair got typecast after the huge success of The Exorcist but that is exactly what happened with her in this straight out slasher flik from the good old 80s.Her and a group of frat and sorority pledges must stay the night in a creepy old manor owned by a madman named Raymond Garth who 12 years earlier had killed his entire family and now comes back to exact some more carnage on these helpless kids.I do enjoy the 80s era of slasher films and gave this 3 stars as I think it is only average when compared to others of the same time.Still breakout the popcorn and a few beers and have a good laugh at the good old horror days of the 80s.
3,three stars for the hot linda blair and this ok ghost/slasher movie,"three stars for this ok ghost/slasher movie and 5 stars for the always hot and sexy linda blair as the girl who fights the killer and makes it through the night. the pleges of (and any name here ) are holding there hell night in the haunted garth manson , and guess what there is a killer still running around in there. well you can guess the rest, but it is fun if you let it be."
5,BEST MOVIE,"BESIDES WATCHING THE EXORCIST, I MUST SAY THIS MOVIE IS SCARY TOO, OFCOURSE NOTHING COMPARES IT WITH THE EXORCIST BECAUSE THE EXORCIST IS MUCH SCARIER THAN ALL THE MOVIES I EVER SEEN, BUT HELL NIGHT IS A GREAT MOVIE TOO."
4,Linda Blair Memories,"Hell NightI find this movie one of extreme interest as I had never seen it before for wont of avoiding horror movies for some time. My everyday life back then was of 24/7 probable horror while serving in the military.It was nice to see the standard college prank relying on an urban legend regarding a haunted house. And boy, the heads soon start to roll. Leave it to Linda's character to save her day at the end. It's just too bad about the remainder of the initiates. Excuse me while I shed a tear or two."
4,One of the few good books on this subject,"There are really only a handful of good books on persuasion on the market. This book is one of them. The author is well experienced in this area after giving programs on communications to Microsoft, Motorola and other large companies.The author does a good job of analyzing the basic factors involved in how others act and react to various factors and how to use those same factors to persuade them to action. Areas covered include motivation, matching your ideas to their needs, developing the relationship, non-verbal communication, handling resistance, influencing groups and writing to persuade.Probably the reason that there are only two reviews is the price tag of the book. There are other books on the subject of persuasion that are as good and even more up to date at about half the price of this book. For more up to date coverage at a reasonable price that covers all the items in this book, try some books by Kevin Hogan or David J. Lieberman."
4,This album is a great mix of jammin blues and witty lyrics.,"This all female band is out of Bellingham, Washington and this is their second album. This album mixes a few upbeat blues songs of revenge, a few slow and sultry songs, and a couple of jammin specials. If you're looking to add an album to your collection that is a bit of blues, a bit of rock, and a whole lot of good music, this is the album for you."
5,"Hot, hot, blues...",This group is rockin'. This was the first blues group that I saw live and I couldn't wait to buy the CD.
1,Don't bother,"I don't know what the people who gave this film a good review were thinking. The movie looks like something a teenager shot over a weekend. Horrible acting, horrible special effects, incoherent storyline, and just bad all the way around. Even for a third rate zombie movie this is not worth wasting your time on. Completely worthless."
2,Only rent if you really must see it.,"The plot had some potential, but unfortunately we ended up with this instead. It's not cheesy, it's lame. This is one of those films where characters make really dumb decisions that make no sense, or do really stupid things in the name of trying to create some tension. So much so that the movie is more tedious and boring then anything. However, because the plot wasn't bad and the effects were pretty decent I gave it 2 stars. That said, I would have to say your not missing anything by passing this one over."
2,eh...,"this movie has great zombies despite its ultra cheap budget, but it actually drags too much and the acting was worse than the 2 minute short dogboy (also dogboy was so much more entertaining). for a zombie flick, go get burial ground:night of terrors instead."
2,sheesh! wannabe horror geek,"First the positive: the gore fx are good. Now the rest: the acting is soooo bad and amateurish. Poorest delivery of lines I've heard in a long time. Also the ""preacher-gone-mad-with-power"" thing has been done before SO MANY TIMES!! GAAWWWD! I do applaud their efforts though...their hearts were in the right place, and they obviously love the classic zombie horror stuff to make a tribute to it--it's just that the tribute's not that good."
2,um...,"ok...i love zombies for whatever weird reason, and that's why i bought this. i was disappointed by the horrendous acting, and the script got kinda specious in many places (or amusingly corny, i.e. the ""action"" lines). however, the gore effects and the general concept were both good. so...i don't regret buying it. however, if you're looking for something that will blow george romero's great trilogy out of the water, you're in the same stranded boat as me: i've found no movies that even prod Dawn of the Dead with a ten-foot pole, and this is no exception. still, this was written, produced, directed and acted in by one guy when he was 19 or thereabouts. that's pretty impressive. in light of that, i'd keep an eye on J.R. Bookwalter, 'cuz if he ever gets a decent budget behind him, i bet he could make a really good movie (or several)."
4,Puts a lot of professional stuff to shame!,"A remarkable achievement with capable photography, some exceptional makeup...add to this a clever screenplay from [director J.R.] Bookwalter and this mix is a potent one. Any synopsis loses a lot of Bookwalter's clever writing, and his direction shows skill on obviously limited means and equipment. Bookwalter also manages the difficult balancing act of keeping the tension tight and the story moving while not missing out on the black comedy of the situation. The film moves at a cracking pace...puts a lot of professional stuff to shame!"
2,Pathetic acting!!!!!!!!,"I ordered this movie because I like almost all zombie movies, but this one was pathetic! The most annoying thing about this video is that the quality of it is poor. The screen always looks dark, and it's not my t.v. screen, it's just the quality of the video. Do yourself a favor, rent this movie first."
5,Great Cheesy Gore I Love It,"I am a huge horror movie/zombie movie fan. I have seen so many zombie movies. Night Of The Living Dead, Dawn Of The Dead, Day Of The Dead, Return Of The Living Dead, and tons of others. But I put this in my top 5 favorite zombie movies. Let me tell you this though, if you are not a fan of cheesy, pretty bad acting zombie movies. You should look elsewhere. But if you like that stuff, ""like me"" you should definitly pick this up. It is a real underated movie, but I think it should be in everyones local video store. It has tons of gore like any zombie movie. The only thing that I dont really like is you never find out how they even became zombies? Other than that I loved the movie. Pick it up today at Amazon."
2,Not even Sam Raimi could save it,"Again, impressive gore effects, some good ideas and I read about Sam Raimi being involved, but this one is so slow in parts! The acting and tech aspects are below par, but not as distracting as the sluggish pace. It seems like people talk for no reason! The effects work is why to buy this. I really couldn't say I would recommend it, but then again, if you don't mind long stretches of tedium, you may be able to enjoy it. If JR would just make things faster ( a re-edit maybe) then it would be a good film. To many subplots and meandering talk scenes."
3,A CHUNKY RED CHEESEFEST !,"J.R. Bookwalter's zombie gore fest ""THE DEAD NEXT DOOR"" is low-budget zombie cheese at it bare bonse best & i love it! A must have for zombie/gore fans!"
1,Waste of film,"This movie was a complete waste of film, film that could have been more appropriately used to create an educational documentary or perhaps even a first-aid video. The Dead Next Door should not even be considered a zombie film or even put in the same horror genre as othe zombie films. It wasn't even funny, so it can't be considered a spoof. Do yourself a favor and don't EVER subject yourself to this complete piece of crap!"
3,Ok zombie film,"This is a surprisingly good zombie movie. Zombies have overrun the US and now a Zombie Squad is going back to where everything started to get the original serum that can destroy zombies. This movie had good gore, okish acting for a B movie, and an actual plot line (although it was confusing at times). Bottom line is, even though this is noDawn of the Dead (Ultimate Edition),Dawn of the Dead (Unrated Director's Cut) [HD DVD] remake or any other Romero or remake film, it is better than some zombie movies out there. At least it is much better thanZombie Nation."
3,I couldn't tell who were supposed to be the zombies,"The acting in this was so awful, it was... *really* entertaining.The effects are surprisingly not as bad as I expected from the reviews, and the plot wasn't without some... meat. But... the acting... egads.Somebody needs to make a MST3K treatment of this. Just... wow. So much to work with here. This will definitely be shown at a drunken zombie marathon someday for my zombiephile friends."
4,cheap indies with heart,"To me this movie is perfect it shows what someone with a passion for the zom""b""ie genre and a little can do attitude can accomplish. The effects are good considering the budget and the era. the acting mostly sucks but thats what the combo of no money and street talent gets you and thats what b movies are all about. over all this movie is now a classic and a ""b""eloved gore fest in our house. i recomend renting first if you're not a lover or a collector of the dead but I say to my brothers in death BUY! BABY BUY!"
2,A disappointing read....,"I found the story to be disjointed and a bit difficult to follow. The character development was poor and when I finished the book I thought, ""That's it?""."
3,Seriously Dissapointing,"This book started with a bang and I was really excited to have found it. As the story moved forward, however, the characters became less and less interesting and the overall arc bored me to tears. I'm about two thirds into the book and I have no intention upon finishing it. Its just plain boring. Sorry."
4,A great book -- hard to put down!,"Really enjoyed the storyline in this book, and was surprised to see that this was Allison's first novel. Very polished writer. Kept me wanting to finish it in almost one day, which is possible, since it's a small book and a fast read. Will be on the lookout for his future writings!"
1,"weak, unrefined effort at music","Where did this CD come from? I'm not certain which musician, let alone, which producer would let something this unfinished come off the line. The tracks with vocals are better served echoing through New York's underground system, looking at least for some form of pulse or life form. A shining example of dead vocals.The other 'tracks' on the CD sound like the DJ looped his creation of ""post meal ciggarette"" notoriety. What a sordid excuse for creating electronica music. This CD is definately not worth buying, let alone stealingi. I hope the artist thinks twice before releasing this unfinished again."
4,i dig,"Mind Elevation is my first taste of NOW, and it was definitely enough to make me want all their stuff. It's a great chill out album, though it has a little more R&B sound on some tracks than i'd prefer, but still that's only 2 or 3 outta 20. Easily worth the 18 bucks."
2,THE SOUND OF SELLING OUT,"What a stunning disappointment Mind Elevation is as a follow-up to Nightmares On Wax's classic 1999 trip-hop masterpiece Carboot Soul. The tasteful, infectious, instrumental grooves of N.O.W.'s previous efforts are evident in smaller, weaker doses here. They have been largely replaced by vocal-heavy tracks which seem hopelessly misplaced. The tracks featuring the singing of Chyna B (""Date With Destiny"", ""Environment"", and the single ""Know My Name"") are particularly cringe-inducing. These tracks in context with the rest of the album seem like a blatant attempt score a hit single and would not sound out of place on a Jennifer Lopez record. That's pretty lo. Oh, how the mighty have fallen."
5,A must see for all young gay men!,"Wow! That is all I have to say. If you are gay (or even not, but open minded), and in need of some hope, then see this film. I'm dissapointed that Amazon will not make this available to people under age 18. I'm sure that it is a blanket policy for ""R"" movies, but if this were about a guy and a girl I am sure that the MPAA would have given it a ""PG13"" or ""PG"". How sad. Still, if you are over 18, buy it, if under, get someone to buy it for you!"
5,I am a teen and feel good about the way I am now!,"If you are a teen you need to see this movie. Before, I was afriad of what I was and not proud. This movie makes you realise that you are like everyone else. It saved my life in many ways."
2,Great movie... Bad DVD,"This is an excellent film on VHS. Nearly worn it out on tape. However, this DVD version is an import and a waste of plastic! I returned mine asap. Gonna wait for a REAL DVD version to be printed. for now, just buy the VHS version."
5,the best there is,"not because it is believable. not because the boys are sweet and cute. not because it has any significant and groundbreaking messages dying to send out. it is simply a fairy tale that gay people are waiting for. a story that restores hope in a world that is no longer romantic or innocent. every actor in this movie is a gem; and together, their collaboration is seamless and synergistic. like wizard of oz, or the sound of music, it reinforces the idea that one can make his/her dream come true if one is determined and powered by love. as cliche as it may sound, life is supposed to be simple yet beautiful. this is a must see. must buy. must rejoice."
3,"Not the best DVD, but infinitely better than VHS","This wasn't the best DVD I've seen, but it was still much better than VHS. The 2 channel Dolby was quite clear, as was the picture. There's no chapter search in the menu, but the movie is split into 16 chapters; allowing for using the DVD's controls to skip or jump to a specific chapter. The always-on subtitles were a disappointment and the chapter breaks were apparently chosen randomly, but overall it's worth it for anyone who can't stand VHS."
5,wonderful thing,"Two young boys coming to terms with their homosexuality and with their love. One of the sweetest gay-themed films of the last decade.I found it touching and romantic, I get never tired of watching it. Wonderfully directed each character is a a little masterpiece:Jamie's mother,her boyfriend, Lea. Another aspect of this film that I find irresistible is the music; beautiful songs accompany the different moments of the story. It's a little masterpiece that I woul heartily recommend to everyone."
3,"Good Movie, But Beware This DVD","The DVD Amazon sells is a Chinese -produced package that is an NTSC (US TV Broadcast standard) video with English dialog but that is subtitled in Chinese -- and unlike every other DVD I've ever seen, there is *NO WAY* to turn off subtitling on this DVD. The effect is distracting."
1,"Great Movie, Lousy Description on Amazon","This is a wonderful movie about English boys coming of age and coming out. I've seen it at least 2 dozen times on cable tv. I thought I'd buy it on dvd and watch it whenever I wanted to, even though it's an [IMPORT]. It is in it's original language British English. But, the subtitles are in chinese and cannot be turned off. This is a real nusance and not an added desired feature. Amazon should update it's description to reflect this flaw."
5,I watch it over and over again!,"This is a beautiful love story, the kind I wish I had had in my teens! I've always been a big fan of Mama Cass. Many of her songs in this movie were themes for my life. Rarely do I find a movie where the writing, directing and acting are so well done. I've known people like many of these characters so the story was believable. I anxiously await this movie to be available on DVD, and I hardly ever buy a movie."
3,"(...) Horrible DVD, But Still a Wonderful Film","I have been waiting for years for this to be made available on DVD, so the quality of the presentation was really disapointing. The picture is muddy, it is overly contrasted, the sound quality is below par and the disk has no menu. In fact, in a side-by-side comparison, the Sony Classics VHS is markedly superior in both picture and sound.On the plus side, this is still a little wonder of a film. The supporting performances are the backbone of the movie: Linda Henry, Tamika Empson and Ben Daniels offer memorable, warm characterizations.I urge Sony/Columbia/Tristar to follow suit and come up with a suitable ""special edition."" If any film deserves one, this is it."
3,Very beautiful,"This movie was very nice. It was often slow...and the main character's (Jaime) family are the only characters that are developed. The only problem is that they are the normal ones. His friend Ste is commonly bruised and is taken in by Jaime's mom for a night. We know why...but we don't know anything about the people involved. The homosexual relationship seems a bit contrived as well...even though they are neighbors, we see no foreshadowing interest in each other from either Jaime or Ste. It is Jaime's mom that suggests the sleep over which is supposed to be how the whole thing gets started...Overall, the movie was very nice...It remains a good movie on its merits...I recommend seeing this movie. The last 20 minutes are one of the best family realization and bonding scenes I have seen in any coming of age story."
3,Poor DVD,Movie is a 5. DVD production poor. You need to change contrast control on DVD player and/or TV to improve the picture. Better than VHS.
5,Must See!!!,"I saw this movie by chance, and I'm so glad that I did. I'm glad each time I watch it. It's truth, sometimes raw, sometimes hilarious. I feel that it's a must-see for anyone who is gay, or is open-minded enough to want to understand what it is to be young, gay, and in love. I wish this had been available 25 years ago.Enjoy!!"
5,Beautiful Thing: Beautiful Film,"Beautiful Thing captures so many of the emotions of growing up gay. The anxiety of others finding out, the fears of rejection, the expression of internalized homophobia and ultimately acceptance. There are so many ways to relate to this film that, LGBT or heterosexual, most people will find themselves drawn into the story. The acting is fantastic and the directing is done such that the film moves right along. I highly recommend this film to all mature audiences."
5,beautiful thing is a beautiful movie..,"This film is still worth watching even after 10 viewings just for the soundtrack alone.Most reviewers have seen it as a breakthrough into mainstream films of a gay young man trying to wend his way through puberty without getting hurt in the process.Wouldnt we all? Perhaps so,and that is not necessarily a bad thing but i just enjoyed it for the freshness and originality of the plot and the wonderful chemistry between its two main co-stars,who by the way are straight.The mother was one mother of a mother,...and I say that admiringly.With that energy she should be running a country not a pub.What ever the critics say I thought all the characters were great. I just hope the actors themselves go on to even better things.You know.....there is room for a plausible sequel at the end of all this....well Ste gets a contract with Manchester United you see,and guess who follows..."
5,Amazing Movie,"One of the best if not THE best coming of age gay love stories out there. It is realistic, tender, moving, funny, not corny and cheesy like some movies that tackle this subject. A must own for me."
4,South London Teen Story,"A story of unprivileged teens' affairs and their surrounding presents kind-hearted helpful people so different from usual characters British cinematography exports-nasty ""Shameless"" and ""Little Britain"" shows, for instance.Probably, too sweet ending adds nothing to surrounding South London reality anyway."
4,Funny and uncomplicated,"So refreshing in our so-called 'sophisticated' nineties, this film succeeds because of its un-self-conscious, tongue in cheek, witty and civilised (read: British) approach to a series of complex issues."
4,16 going on 17,"I did enjoy this film - it had animated characters - gay sexual tensions - a bit of drama - and a heartwarming ending- 4 stars -You know the story Gay Boy (Jamie) falls for the Hot Boy Next Door (Ste). Is he Gay? Is he Straight? Find out in this loving film about your average nutty neighbors all trying to coexist. Plus this film features a scene that had me holding my breath - Jamie makes the first move, a very tense moment in any young mans life!"
5,Touching Coming of Age Movie,"Beautiful Thing is an LGBT coming of age movie. Even though the movie is dated, it still strikes a good point into it's audience. It explores subjects like High School bullying, questioning oneself, and coming out to your parents.Overall, the story was down to earth, with unexpected comedy riddled here and there. I highly reccomend the movie to anyone who enjoys the slice-of-life genre."
5,Absoloutely Amazing,"Like most people who have seen this film, i love it.The 1st time i cried, it is so touching...You are garunteed to love it."
3,Great Movie...disappointing DVD quality,"This is a fabulous movie for anyone with a heart. It explores the relationship of two young men growing up, which is difficult in itself, but than you have the added complexity of sexuality. This is a heart felt & moving tale of relationships and love.The DVD itself is a big disappointment, the Chinese subtitles which CANNOT be removed can be a distraction too. This movie is a classic, you won't want to miss it."
5,FINALLY out in the US on DVD!!,"I'm so glad I can finally retire my horrid Japanese-subtitled DVD of Beautiful Thing! This is a very well-done transfer to DVD of a great coming-of-age gay 'fairy tale' of live in Thamesmead outside of London. If you've been waiting as long as I have for this movie to come out on DVD, your wait is over! My only reservation about this DVD transfer is there are no bonus features and no closed-captioning or subtitles for the hearing impaired. Those accents can be hard to follow at times! Well worth any price just to HAVE it on DVD, though! :)"
4,The Movie,"The movie was pretty good. It also has closed caption. Closed Caption is a plus. Because I am hearing impaired.The cover is also good. because it shows part of the movie of what is about. so, Its good."
1,Subtitles Needed,"After reading all the wonderful reviews written (and not being able to find this moview in the local video store)I decided to purchase Beautiful Thing. I was thrilled to get it within a few days of placing the order. However, I was very dissapointd in the film. The main reason:the movie offers no subtitles. Subtitles make a BIG difference when a dialect is heavy. I could only understand about one quarter of what the characters were saying, and that I had to really concentrate on). So for me, this spoiled the movie. Other than that, Beautiful Thing looks like it could be a good movie. On the positive, I admired the actors looking normal instead of having a Hollywood polish."
2,"The movie gets 5 stars, the DVD gets 1","This is one of my all time favorites, but I was very disappointed with the DVD. What everyone says is true... no features, subtitles that you can't get rid of, bad sound. I kept it however because the movie is just so good. I will be keeping my eye out for a real DVD release of it."
5,Very cute,Loved this movie and so happy I bought it. Warmed my heart and made me feel like a kid again.
1,Great Movie - Really Bad DVD,"I was vert disappointed with the quality of this DVD, because I really love the film. The quality is terrible, there are no menus, and no way to turn off the subtitles. It's very distracting, and makes watching the film difficult. Get a copy of the video instead."
4,TOTAL LOVE,"This is a movie that shows how much love can break all boundries. So many times we never show how much we love that special someone, but, this film shows us how to do just that. Excellent characters and wonderful cinematography. This is a must have video for everyone, gay straight bi."
5,Beautiful Thing,I think this is perfect movie for any that wants to come out is afraid to tell some that there are people who don't care of your sexual preference. It is the person that matters.
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!,"Being a 20 year old straight male, you would think a movie like this could'nt possibly interest me - THINK AGAIN! I happened to be at my brothers home (yes, he's gay) and he asked me to watch this film and give him an opinion on whether or not to show it to our parents. I did not know what I was in for. This film had me glued to the couch - in the same way Krazy Glue suspended that man from the skyscraper by his safety helmet. This movie made such an impression on me, it took time to sink in that this was a love story involving 2 young men. Immidiately, I purchased the home video. To the powers that be: I hope there is a DVD version soon!"
4,Glad I Saw It,"...I loved it. It's the kind of thing that really makes you feel good, but it's very quiet in its own way. You want the characters to be bolder, but if you're like me, you realize that you shouldn't put so much pressure on them- you're not that bold either. ... All in all, it's a very accurate picture of what discovering your [self] actually means. And I have to say,..., the kid who played Jamie was actually pretty cute. He had a nice smile. (Well, he was cute! What can I say..."
1,Still waiting for the real thing,"This is one of my favorite ""small"" films; very real, very honest and with a great soundtrack. Saw the play too and loved it. This DVD though is a Chinese (Japanese?) pressing with no extras. I sent it back and am still waiting for the American release. Caveat emptor."
2,Why one should always read reviews of products...,"While I was extremely delighted to see that there was a release of this film on DVD format, I let that fact get the better of me before researching the entire product. The film itself is quite possibly one of the most brilliant ""gay"" films ever. The characters and story line are honest and crisp. HOWEVER, I was completely disappointed when I recieved the film and there were CHINESE SUBTITLES????? Funny that fact was omitted from the ""product details"" although I would consider that an important piece of information."
1,"Beautiful Film, Terrible DVD","This beautiful, charming, heart-warming, endearing and moving film about coming out as gay in a working-class milieu has been given an abysmal transfer onto DVD, imported from China with huge Chinese subtitles that cannot be turned off and interfere abominably with the viewer's pleasure. The quality of both the sound and the picture is also poor. I returned it. It is to be hoped that an excellent transfer with extra features which we expect on DVD will be available soon. Don't buy it! Instead, get the VHS, or wait for a good DVD."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"While I liked the story in general and I thought that the acting was good, the cockney accent made 40% of the dialogue very difficult to understand. Spending some money for English subtitles would have been a good investment."
2,A Flawed Thing,"Many gay reviewers unfortunately have not been balanced in rating films like this and rate it so highly primarily due to a misguided loyalty to anything gay rather than things of quality.This film has a touching storyline at times and I have to admire that, however it is far too flawed in its disjointed and very assuming storytelling to deserve such a high rating and content wise the love story, coming of age and coming out may be beautiful but the drug content, language and sudden coming out of many characters who were straight without clear explaination of the reversal of sexuality is more than a little confusing.An average film dipicting poor, violent and crass British folks and the love between two teenage boys in this enviroment. Has some very touching moments, but overall highly flawed.The DVD would also have benefitted from optional subtitles, like most do, for those of us who find the heavy British accents hard to understand."
5,"Shai'Dee says ""There is nothing more beautiful than this.""","""Beautiful Thing"" is just that a beautiful thing. Never before has there been a movie that captures the essence of living on the outside looking in or the akwardness of love and life. This movie creates such an emotional stir that every gay teen needs to see it to feel the moment. This movie depicted the moment of self-discovery and acceptance as a ""beautiful thing"" and I give a my regards to the director for her vision."
5,Wonderful,"This film deserves massive props for being one of the leaders in gay cinema. It does not portray gay people as trashy or as comic releif. It illustrates gay people when they are most innocent: as teens.This is a gay teen love story. Watching the two young men try to stay together while not making a big scene is something I'm sure a lot of people can relate to. Sometimes it is diffucult to understand what the characters are saying because of the British accent, but the important lines of diaolgue are easy to understand.At first I thought the events of the film moved a bit quickly, but after watching it again, it all fits into place. This movie is definitly beautiful and worth watching."
5,Groundbreaking,"Finally there came a great love story/coming of age movie that didn't focus on the ""guilt"" of being gay. True one of the two lovers comes out slowly, but that's true in real life too... This movie is authentic and wonderful... It's a beautiful film"
4,B & C Eagle B16-114 1-1/4-Inch by 16 Gauge Galvanized Finish Brad Nails,"I addition to other brands, I've been using the B&C; nails in all of my various pneumatic nailers for years and have never had any issues with them. These 1-1/4"" nails have been working fine in my PC 16-gauge straight finish nailer. No problems with jams or with the nail strips hanging up in the nail chute.These nails are galvanized, so are good for most exterior trim work. I generally find myself using galvy nails for interior trim and everything else these days and since the price difference really isn't that much, I don't even bother to stock bright nails for my pneumatic nailers anymore. I find these to be very good finish nails at a decent price for a 2500 count box."
3,A strange yet interesting work,"The first thing you hear when you put in Eyvind Kang's ""Sweetness Of Sickness"" doesn't exactly compell you to keep listening. The first track ""The Eternity"" seems like something of a noisefest, but the beautiful NADE theme emerges from the storm. This is the basic concept here, finding sweetness under the sickness, and for the most part it is quite effective. The album isn't for everyone, you probably should have pretty twisted tastes if you're planning to enjoy it. For something slightly easier on the ears, check out Kang's ""Theatre Of Mineral NADEs"" on Tzadik."
2,Interesting Read,This was an interesting read but it lacked clarity and direction. It would not reccomend this book just because there are so many better books out there to read. However it is not a bad book and it does have a few interesting parts.
1,Doesn't Clamp all the way down,"I eneded up returning this straightner. I like the width because I have very long, thick hair. But the ends don't clamp together or all the way down and it doesn't work. I would not buy this product."
1,Quit Working After Only 3 Weeks,"This was a piece of junk. It worked just fine for 3 whole weeks, then it died. Do not purchase this flat iron!!"
1,"Unreliable, Warrantly Service a Joke","Unit started ejecting tapes. Sent it away for warranty service. Four weeks later got it back -- still broken. Took a week to get a response from JVC. Sending it back again. I wonder how long it will take this time. I wonder if they'll fix it.When it worked, it was great. Now it's a doorstop, four months after purchasing it -- 5 weeks of which has been down time. Thanks, JVC."
3,"nice unit, but complicated","I'm pleased with the VCR, but it took about an hour to get it set up properly. Plug & play didn't work. I finally ended up setting the channels and clock manually, and the initial configuration is relatively complicated. I am a little bit disappointed with the remote. One reason that I selected a JVC VCR is because I hoped it would interoperate well with my other JVC components, but the remote is awkward to use with my TV and DBS. Overall though, it has a lot of nice features for the money, and the picture quality is good."
1,Nice Features but mine died after 1 year,"I've had two JVC VCRs - the first one was excellent, and lasted for many years of top notch service. This one has excellent features, very good picture. The control layout on the front of the unit and the remote leaves something to be desired, though.The real killer is that my machine died just after the warranty expired. Boy, was I pissed. One day I found it just sitting there, dead. I don't know if it was just this one, but I am now without a VCR, and I'm trying to figure out if I should try another JVC or not."
2,Not so great!,These nails are not the quality of the name brand senco etc nails. They jam up in our guns and have caused some expensive repairs.
2,Uno de los mejores CD's de la historia del rock en español,"""La Taberna del Buda"" es una obra de puro arte. Cada canción es una pieza de excelencia. La letra y la música son igualmentes inspiradas. Nunca antes había yo escuchado a este grupo, y estoy MUY agradecido por la buena suerte de haber descubierto a un trío de genios musicales tanto como son los hermanos Quijano. Intento seguir coleccionando a todos sus CD's."
4,Dry cow for thrush in horses,"Seems to be doing the job. The thrush is in the crack in the heel, and the little nozzle is perfect for getting it in there. I know it's healing when I can no longer insert the nozzle."
3,yeah right,"Hmmm, well, I guess my kid didn't read this book. Some advice was useful (the timer advice), but only until he heard me talking about the timer to someone else. Offering positive rewards though ... what do you do when the kid ups the ante every time you try to offer him something nice? He takes everything to an impossible level, doesn't want what I'm offering (though if it weren't offered as a reward, he would want it), and magnifies it to something he does want. Something I am unable/unwilling to provide. And it's 10:00 PM and he's still up. Again. And now I'm in a position where I have to deny him things I want to give him or do for him because he refuses to do the things I offered them as rewards for."
3,Toddler Handbook,"This is a well thought out handbook for parents of toddler through preschool age. A mother of three boys, only one of which is stil in preschool, I would have liked to have found this book sooner. My boys however have outgrown most of the behaviors described in the book. I would strongly recommend this book for a new parent, but if your child is older than three, I would pass on this one."
2,Discipline Without Shouting or Spanking,I don't like the product because it wasn't what I expected when I got the book.I was just expecting something different than it was.I don't want to spank or yell at my child and I won't but also some of the things it said I felt was just letting your child run you and that isn't right. Children not getting the discipline they need is some of the problem with our world today. The Bible even speaks in Proverbs of disciplining your child not letting your child run you.I do believe there are right ways to discipline without yelling or spanking but I don't believe I found what I was looking for in this book.However some other people might really find it to be what they need.
2,more hippie nonsense,"It's more of the same hippie, tree hugging nonsense that the majority of these books contain. I can save you the trouble, talk to your kids, give them time out, that's about it. What a waste."
2,May work on a child not needing dicipline,"This book was too simplistic in its approach to dicipline. The methods would probably work on a child that isn't a dicipline problem, but merely acts out occasionally. The author also assumes that the methods will work, no exception. I can attest that a very willful child will not be swayed by the rewards or privilge removal program. I have yet to find a book that does truly help with a difficult child. This one certainly doesn't."
3,Some good ideas...,"This book is divided into behavior problems, such as, ""Playing With Food"", ""Taking Things"", ""Lying"", etc... and then gives you a list of steps to avoid the problem and correct the misbehavior. It also provides ""real-life"" situations that show how parents applied the approach outlined.However, the books that I have personally found to be the most useful are the ones that outline approaches that can be applied to every disciplinary problem, such as, ""1-2-3 Magic"" which still works on my kids after 2.5 years, and ""Time-In"", which teaches kids to think about their behavior and its consequences, and how to make amends when necessary.I can see this particular book being useful for trouble shooting specific problems, if other approaches aren't effective, but I didn't feel the need to keep it on my bookshelf and I've passed it on to a neighbor."
1,Screaming examples,"The author of this book uses ""fictionalized"" stories to give examples of how spanking is wrong and timeouts are right. The problem with these stories is that parents are always portrayed as ""screaming"" as they spank their child. This gives the impression that a parent who spanks is always out of control. Then the ""fictionalized"" account tells us that spanking never works and timeouts always work. I had a hard time believing the ""fictionalized"" accounts, they are just not believable!"
4,Psych Punk Snarl,"If you've seen the Superbees live, you know that this disc just doesn't do them justice. That said, I still like this album a whole lot. Great psych punk with blistering MC5 style leads and great drumming. If you are that big of a fan of the MC5, go get their CD. Standout tracks on this are ""Really Wanna Know"", ""Loose"", ""Run Rabbit Run"". After you get this CD, get off your a** and go see them live. The twin Gibson SG Marshall stack attack will rock your socks off. In a perfect world, Mooney Suzuki would be these guys' roadies. Lick my boots, see you at the L.A. Shakedown."
5,Great Product,"It is exactly what it says it is, self-laminating sheets. They get the job done. I will say if you are laminating bigger pieces of paper I would look into using an actual laminating machine because the bigger the paper the harder it is to not get wrinkles in it. But I use these with no problem on 4x6 and 5x7 pieces of paper."
5,Great For Applique!,"I use these for my applique quilting, and they work wonderfully. The price couldn't be better. Amazon does it again!"
3,laminating sheets,"The sheets are not as thick as I thought they would be.But, otherwise, they were a good value."
5,brings back the memories,"everytime i play this cd, memories of my days in college ('86) comes to life. i especially like the last song which sounds more like a jam between earl and the session musicians that accompanied him on this outing."
5,Excellent cd....great production!!!,"This CD of the great Earl Klugh is very interesting. Account with arrangements for strings of the mythical Don Sebesky and accompaniment at the keyboards of the talented Greg Phillinganes. Beautiful melodies, excellent instrumental arrangements and an excellent interpretation in the guitar playing of the great master Klugh. Here you can also enjoy a beautiful saxophone solo of the great Michael Brecker. Highly recommended."
4,"Great Hardcore, but not enough","I've been an NIV fan for a while and this album did not dissapoint from the musical aspect. All 11 songs are hard and heavy and bring everything I've come to expect from NIV. However, the thing that keeps me from giving this album 5 stars is its length. Clocking in at 22 minutes, it is undoubtably the shortest album I've ever paid ... for. I suppose the argument could be made that instead of putting in a bunch of filler, NIV opted for quality over quantity. While this may be true, I think all of us want more than 22 minutes for our hard earned cash. Definately some good music here but lets tack on 15 or 20 minutes more next time."
5,Best first amazon purchase!,"My first time using Amazon! My little sister is in love with the Sonic Series, so we looked up merchandise for one of her favorite characters (Knuckles, of course) and found this. I was a little skeptical about the quality, but wow, this thing is an awesome plushie. Really good quality. She loves it! We keep it with our other Anime plushies (even though this really isn't an Anime)! i highly recommend buying it, especially if you're a collector! :D"
5,A little treat for my self,"Well, I've been playing Sonic games since I was 13 years old, and I do love plush toys... so I had to endulge myself and get me a little treat"
1,Amazon screwed up!,I was hoping to get the X edition of Knuckles but instead I got another classic Kux. and on top of that I checked the tracking of this and it's saying it has not been deliver and it's way pass the delivery dates.Why! what happen to my Knuckles? wheres my correct package?
1,Product received not what was ordered.,Ordered Modern Knuckles pictured and described. Less expensive Classic Knuckles received. Was willing to pay more for Modern Sonic because no one else had it. Very disappointed.
5,"Jump, Boogie, & Blues",Len here!What more can a Blues & Jazz lover ask for? This band did it all & it seemed like thay had a good time doin' it. For me Tiny's band rate's up thar with the best of 'em.Keep Jazzin' & Bluesin' everyone ! Len
5,Awesome,This is exactly what I was looking for. The vocals are very and the karaoke versions are professional quality.
4,Labor of Love,Both of these stories were cute. I felt that they maybe could have been less rushed but they were worth the price of the book.
1,Nothing New,"This is Huff's 3rd edition of the book. The first one published in 1990 included cutting-edge research and was really great!! The second edition was not as good (since it did not offer too much cutting-edge knowledge) but had some great informative studies. The third edition is by far, the worst. Most of the 18 chapters are literature reviews and offer nothing significant to our knowledge of gangs. If there is a 4th edition published, I hope to see qualitative or quantitative empirical research and by different authors NOT included in editions 1 through 3."
1,Boring,"I read the 2nd edition of GIA and enjoyed it and learned a lot from it. This edition is very disappointing. A few of the chapters were informative AND kept me interested, but the majority of the book was a review of previous gang studies (as a reader/reviewer has stated already) and burdensome to go through. If there was any current information (the statistics may have been current), I don't think it was worth reading the entire book just to locate current information on gang activity in the U.S. I'm using this book as a textbook for a class I am teaching (I assumed it would be similar the GIA 2nd edition), but I will definitely change books next semester. If I didn't gain anything from this book, I don't think my students will learn from it."
1,"Really, really bad!","100 pages of nothing but whining and women bashing by angry, resentful men. This book is actually 215 pages long, but I couldn't stomach reading the rest of it."
1,Please don't buy this watch,"The biggest problem about this watch is that it is made of very cheap alloy. when you pick it up it is unbelievably light. The features advertized on this watch are very counter-intuitive and very difficult to use. The light on the watch is not the indiglow kind, but the one that shines only a part of the face of the watch. Also, the analog part of the watch is set by using a button that only makes the minute hand move forward.In my opinion, you're better off paying a little more for a decent watch, but if you are really looking for a cheap watch, just go to Target or Walmart. At least you can try them out before buying them"
1,Superior service and economical,"Wow, what speedy service (received in 4 days). Good instructions (but had to be read twice) to set the digital/analog time as well as the alarms (reminding me to take my medications). Took a few more minutes to adjust the band, but the only real dislike is the watch thickness. The rating is for all the bells and whistles at a very low cost."
4,Interesting reflection about the philosophical conversation over time,"John Gunnell has strongly argued that the idea of a philosophical tradition is, at best, simplistic and, more likely, a myth. He has contended that the notion of thinkers ""conversing"" directly with those who have gone before them misunderstands the nature of the activity of philosophizing about politics. In this book, he elaborates upon that point and, in the process, gets the reader thinking about the philosopical tradition. I am especially interested in this book, because the author gave a presentation on the general topic to doctoral students in political science at the State University of New York at Buffalo four decades ago--and I was one of those listening to his talk."
5,What isn't good about this book?,"Books that I usually read are nothing compared to the Misfits. The story was so well crafted, I couldn't help but read ahead of my class when we were reading this in school. James Howe grasped these kids in the book, and made them seem so real, it's like your going to see them walking down the hall together when the period bell rang. How he wrote it makes you think that he just went through middle school, knowing exactly how it feels to be called the names that the people in the book thought were exceptable for ""the Gang of Five."" Instead of making it another story where everyone lives happily ever after, and the good guys win all the time, he made this story real. Realism was woven into each word, entwined whenever Addie spoke, and that's what made the book so unique.Maddie L"
4,"A powerful novel, but...","This is a very powerful novel that anyone who has ever been called a name can relate to and anyone who has called names should read. It focuses on four ""misfits,"" who decide to create a third party for their middle school's student council elections. Along the way, they deal with issues of loss and love, while building their campaign around the platform of name calling.I would have given this four stars, but for two problems. Howe writes the book in present tense, which distracts the reader from the story, especially as the narrator occasionally seems to be looking back on these events from the future. Howe also lets his voice come through, rather than the narrators, which brought me out of the story.However, if you can overcome these slight issues, this is a fantastic book, even if you're over its target age."
3,Chatty But Unsatisfying Story,"I wasn't too excited by this book by James Howe. It is about several outcasts who run for office and attention. Too chatty and ""cool"" for my taste."
5,A wonderful book targeted at middle school students,"Written for middle-school age students,(but well worth reading by anyone age 10 and up) this book was the inspiration for the No Name Calling Week project. A terrific book of how kids who ""don't fit in"" change attitudes about name calling."
4,unrealistic but go for it anyway,"the misfits is well written, witty, and guarenteed to induce thought even if your brain is fried. four unpopular kids-a tall skinny girl who doesn't know when to shut up, a fat kid living in a trailer, a gay guy with little faces painted on his fingernails, and a greaser who looks like something out of the outsiders or west side story-create their own party in the class election. Their point in the end is to stop the name calling, which does happen. some innaccuracies: 1) kids in middle school aren't that mean. 2) its unrealistic to think that four geeky seventh graders are going to get boyfriends or girlfriends, especially with popular people. 3) the ending-something out of a teen movie. still, read it."
2,The Misfits,"This is a wonderful book (for older teens) and as a person who has suffered from teasing and name calling it sounds great. My problem is that this appeared on my 10-year-old brother's reading list. When you are ten and entering the sixth grade, you do not give this book for them to read. As a high schooler I know gay people and am friends with them. I am not intolerant of them. The problem is it is recommended for 10 - 14 year olds. You grow up tremendously from these ages. I feel 12 is the earliest you should read this. I read the book and it backed me up. I read books in school that deal with many issues. I am old enough to handle it and they are not intended for younger children. This book is for older students - end of discussion."
5,Wonderful Book,"The book The Misfits is a wonderful book for people of all ages. It may sound like a book that has a childish theme but it doesn`t. Told through the eyes of a young boy named Bobby, this book makes you feel great and urges you to help make a difference."
5,A must read book,"The Misfits by James Howe. I really liked this book because it was about how these four kids in the seventh grade are best friends. The four charecters are Addie, Bobby, Joe, and Skeezie. They call themselves the Gang of Five. The Gang of Five meet once a week at the Candy Kitchen to talk about important issues. Bobby is the main charecter he is the one who is telling the story. He is twelve years old and he works at Awkworth & Ames. Addie is against a lot of things that has to do with the rules. The first thing she refuses to do is to say the pledge at the beginning of class. Then she started a third party in their student council elections. Joe ans Skeezie are Bobby and Addie's best friends. They all learn the meaning of love and what it's like to fall in love. They also find their true self by...."
5,A must read for all young adults and teachers,"Have you ever been called a name? I'll bet you didn't like it. It's not fun being made fun of or being labeled. Most of us are much more complex than a single name or label can say. The characters in this book are 4 friends who sit down one day and make a list of all the names they have been called by their classmates. When they are done the list totals over 50 names. Instead of sulking, being depressed, or becoming violent, these kids decide to fight back in a logical and peaceful way. They run for Student Council on a ""No Name Calling"" platform. This book will make you laugh, cry, and feel everything in between."
4,Very Good.,"This is an easy and enjoyable read, chronicling the life of Raphael Semmes, the South's preeminent commerce raider.Rising from the obscurity of Washington, D.C.'s bureaucracy, Raphael Semmes's goes to sea the age 54 and never returns home until his ship, the CSS Alabama is sunk by the USS Kearsarge off Cherbourg, France toward the end of the Civil War. Along the way he assembles a list of victories that would make any successful naval commander blush.But is that good enough for Semmes? After his defeat, he returns from France to the Confederacy. Avoiding the Union blockade by entering Matamoros, Mexico, he makes his way overland to Richmond where he not only is in charge of the Confederate Navy presence during the fall of Richmond, but he also subsequently is responsible for protecting the Confederacy's Treasury during the Presidential escape from Richmond.Raphael Semmes is a true Confederate hero who again out foxes his Union counterparts in the final days of the war."
3,For lovers of Latin house only--no progressive Rosario mix,"Not to discredit the style of house, just letting fans of Ralphi Rosario's hard stuff know that there is no hard, tribal, or progressive mix on this single. All mixes have an upbeat Latin flavor."
5,Nice and refreshing,This tea is really good either as hot tea or iced tea! I drink tea almost everyday and this is one of my favorites.
5,Your guests will rave over this tea,"This tea is wonderfully tasting and the aroma is delightful. It is impossible to find this tea in area grocery stores. Guests love this tea and rave over it because the flavors are so diffierent and distinctive. Definitely a ""must have"" tea in your tea chest. Highly recommended."
5,TWININGS 'TASTES OF SUMMER'...OUT OF THIS WORLD. 8],"This variety pack is a great way to 'get to know' Twinings teas...if you don't already know how good Twinings is.If you have difficulty finding this item in the grocery store (Twinings is making them more available), then just go to their website and buy what you would like. You can't lose with Twinings brand .ENJOY!"
3,"Mildly interesting, plodding, overly long.","Dr. Aldridge may be a brilliant psychologist, but she gets ve-e-ery nervous and unsure of herself in the oddest situations. How this gal ever made it through college and grad school without having a nervous breakdown is beyond me. The Author could have pared the book down to 300 pages (from 650) by eliminating some of his preaching as well as Dr. Aldridge's unusual anxiety and fear of nuclear reactors.I wouldn't recommend this book"
5,Excellent Sci-Fi based on plausible futurehorizon view of AI,"Society of the Mind is an AI cybergastro-extravaganza. To prepare, take one once-every-million-year genius, try to simmer with a beautiful fit-conscious Harvard psychologist, stir in back-propogation neural networks, fuzzy logic boards, and Darwinian ""survival of the fittest"" software insects, cook until you have the consistency of ""precambridgian"" technological soup, sprinkle with astrophysics, and bring to a boil. If possible, let cool before serving. Serve to an unlimited number of under 8 foot guests"
3,Flawed but Intriguing,"Although the characters are somewhat flawed in their development (the pretty airhead psychologist, the genius recluse, the shoot first security chief), and although it degenerates into a Jurassic Park scenario towards the middle and end, this book ultimately satisfied my aim fr reading the book, by providing some glimpses of some very interesting concepts.Analogue computers, personality disorders (which ultimately made a consistent and acceptable explanatin for the Jurassic Park fun) and a computer who doesn't want to die - this is my first discovery of some ideas which I feel will become more interesting and profound in the very near future. Definitely worth a look on that basis."
2,Cyberthriller?? More like Cybercrap,"This was the most implausible, hokey bunch of bull that I have ever read. This book really belongs in the classification of a love story for geeks. A true waste of money"
5,Incredible,"I don't usually write reviews, but I simply thought this book was stunning. I found the eventual diagnosis of the relationship between the computer and Gray to be haunting. After finishing the book, I was compelled to flip back and re-read entire sections to see how they all elegently fit together...the statue, the Other, and each of the VR machine scenes. Do yourself a favor and read this book."
2,General-Religions,"This is a general book, and is good for those who may have some doubts about their faith in Christ. As a Deist, I felt that deism was linked with atheism too much. Deism is the belief in God based on reason, and atheism isn't. The book covers Paine, Hume, Bolingbroke, Jefferson, Voltaire, among others, but leaves out John Locke. Overall it was an easy read, if you skip the buddist section?"
3,"Okay, but a bit over-simple","Rinaldo has a bad habit here of collapsing distinctions that ought to be maintained. It's difficult to see the line between liberal Christians and deists in eighteenth century America, much less deists and agnostics, but Rinaldo skims over such perplexities...."
4,"Great VCR, and arrived so Quickly. A+++.",It is my first purchase on Amo.com. It was Fast and the VCR is very cool. Mr.B.
1,BIG DISSAPOINTMENT...OBVIOUSLY...,"everything stopped with Afraid Of Sunlight, then there were just individual songs (This Strange Engine,Interior Lulu) and one or 2 songs here and there...Marillion are great middle aged musicians that after having written great music they are now trying desperately to enter the charts and gain a new young public, by writing rubbish!!they used to write their own music now they imitate very badly a new brit pop/rock type of music that seeks money and fame!!DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM, don't do them this favour, BUY EVERYTHING ELSE THEY'VE WRITTEN FROM CLUTCHING AT STRAWS TO AFRAID OF SUNLIGHT.THE REST IS RUBBISH EXCEPT THE SONGS ""THIS STRANGE ENGINE,INTERIOR LULU,ANGELINA,THE ONLY UNFORGIVABLE THING).THAT'S IT!!I'm not even going to wee them live, I've had enough of their ""new"" style (new is great but new is bad when it's only a bady imitation of a bad kind of music) bye bye marillion..."
1,JUST GETTING USE TO!!!!!!!!,WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED TO THESE GUYS.ONE WORD DESCRIBES THIS.SUCK!!!!!!SLOW AND REPETITIVE..BIG DISSAPPOINTMENT..
4,This one is great but...,"...I would hold out, save up, and buy the 2-disc edition directly from racket records at the band's website. The campaign or other 2-disc version is more complete. I've tried this mix, and it's fantastic, but the 2-disc will take you to an even more fantastic place! It's a little more $, but it's well worth it.This version is 4-stars,but 2-disc gets 5 stars!"
5,Marillion woke up again !,"I was very surprised with this album, I am very critical of marillion if I have to be, but this time things are quitedifferent, along with Tempano's "" the agony and the ecstasy"" this is one of my top five in the last 3 years.A must have ! ( that goes for both albums)"
5,Their best in years,"I admit that I am a big Marillion fan and share the frustration others have mentioned here about not hearing them on the radio. Also, I am one of those fans that paid Marillion before Marbles was done just to have the chance to hear it.This album is fascinating. The melodies are pure rock n roll with lots of meaning, thought and insite into the band's world. If you are a fan of Genesis, Pink Floyd or Asia, you MUST buy this album. You will not be dissappointed."
2,What's with the marbles?,"I stopped buying Marillion after 'Made Again' and gave up on them after the wretched 'Afraid of sunlight'. It doesn't seem that I missed much. Marillion I fear never got over the loss of Fish and with each cd it appears to be the case. Steve H's vocals will either thrill you or irritate you depending on your mood. I have never gotten used to his voice despite repeated listenings. I did like 'Brave' but only because the music was particularly good. 'Marbles' is a strange one, way too many introspective slower tracks and not enough rockers. It's a laid back disc a bit like 'Brave'. The longer tracks: 1 & 11 work better than the whole of the disc. The band puts in a good performance but nothing that requires repeated listenings sorry to say. Sound quality is very good. Full booklet/lyrics/credits plus a video of 'Don't hurt yourself'. 11 tracks/64.11."
2,Weird music...,"They are journeying more and more into unknown territory.. In this case, this oftens backfires, because some of the songs here are so boring that defies explanation, although obviously the are done with the customary Marillion excellence."
4,Sounds similar to Afraid of Sunlight with a touch of Coldplay thrown in.,Short and sweet - Sounds similar to Afraid of Sunlight with a touch of Coldplay thrown in.
5,a masterpiece by all meanings,"WOW! there are not enough stars to rate this album, an amazing sonic journey.marillion has always been one of the best bands in the world, but since hogart join the band, it has just complete the circle with the other members of the band.from the first sounds of invisible man the journey begins.what can i say im not going to rate song by song , probably the weakest moments is drilling holes. and the best moments are invisible man,the only unforgiveable thing,neverland,fantastic place,angelina,ocean cloud,genie ,dont hurt yourself. excellent i mean really excellent songs.and the lyrics oh man this can write,play and sing.thats probably the biggest difference between fish and H.marbles is in the same league as the all time great albums"
5,Another masterpiece.,"WOW! Marbles is an intelligent, thoughtful, haunting and soaring listen; easily their most powerful album since Afraid of Sunlight. There have been plenty of amazing moments for Marillion in the time since ""Sunlight,"" but this is clearly their most realized FULL album in close to a decade.A great narrative set to some of the band's most inspired instrumental moments, Marbles has a great themes and an overwhelming message throughout -- just don't call it a concept album in the same way that ""Brave"" or ""Misplaced Childhood"" emerged.Let's just say it's hard to keep from ""losing your marbles"" with so many things ""Drilling Holes"" in your head early and often... The fact that this band is largely a mystery to most after 20 years is beyond my comprehension. This album will put its arms around your soul and take it dancing."
3,"Great, but the 2-cd english edition is better","Probably this is the best Marillion album since Brave, but if you want the full experience of marbles, better buy the 2-cd english version exclusive form racket records web site. That 2 cd box has an extraordinary design, and a track that is not an extra, with ""Neverland"" is the core of the album, the song is called ""Ocean Cloud"", it takes about 17 min and is the final track of the first CD, and extraordinary and beautiful musical landscape. Get it from racket now."
2,Disappointing,"Finally... a new album from Marillion. I was very anxiously awaiting this album. I finally bought it and I sometimes wonder whether my expectations were just too high?MY favorite albums (AOS, Anorak, Clutching) still seem better than this one. I didn't quite like ""Map of the world"" previously and this album has many of those songs. I wonder if Marillion is taking a turn into a more mainstream direction??????A few songs are really old fashion Marillion but I really have to get used to a new Marillion.I guess they are appealing to a much younger crowd...I'll wait for the next one. Long live Clutching at Straws!!!"
4,Let it grow on you,"This is a review of the single cd version.On the first listen I was surprised it sounded so mainstream (for Marillion, anyway). Since I found the music quite pleasant, I kept playing it and kept finding layers and layers of surprises, which is quite typical from these guys. I like it a lot now, A LOT."
5,An excellent CD and a great listen,"I really enjoyed the cd. I heard it for the first time when I was in France many years ago.The music is soothing and catchy at the same time.It draws you in with its tales of love and romance.A beautiful selection of music.I would recommend it to anyone.This cd is hard to find in the stores ,it is always sold out even after all these years."
1,Poor Quality,"The quality is really poor. Skip this one unless you can handle what sounds like 3-4th generation bootleg quality. The show seems like a great show though, some hard to find songs live like Third World Girl & Rockin After Midnight, but wow...this show needs some kind of remastering before actually being released."
5,Great product.,"I tried this product off and on over the years as my dragon got older. When he was younger, he wouldn't touch it. Every 6 months or so, I'd try again with no luck. He's about 5 yrs old now, and all of a sudden he loves this stuff. It's the first food he goes for, even over crickets and superworms. It's really handy to have around. Just keep it in the fridge and it'll last a good long while. No feeding or upkeep like live food. I'd recommend buying a small pack first to see if your dragon will eat it."
1,Bad Product,"I received this item in poor condition. The jars where taped shut because the seal was broken and the contents where spoiled, partially white like mold and smelled bad. I have purchased Dragon Bites in another store over the years and it never looked like this. The sticker on the bottom told me that the items were expired. I was quickly sent a replacement for these 3 items, but they were in the exact same condition. I requested a refund, but have not heard from them."
1,Wat is this book about?,"I could not figure this book out. I love Anna Griffin papers but this book is just a haze of pretty pictures. It gave no real useful information on how to be a better scrapbooker or even how to scrapbook in the ""Anna Griffin"" style. Not my cup of tea."
1,Doesn't work on a glass tank!,"I bought this because out of all the Amazon aquarium thermometer reviews it was the only one that had a few ""decent"" remarks and was worth a gamble at the low price. Unfortunately it did not work on my tank at all which may mean that it doesn't get a good reading on glass or simply that it's just very cheaply made. Also the thermometer i received did not look like the one in the photo except the part that even after being left on the tank undisturbed for several days 3 temperatures continued to stay colored therefore you never knew what the actual temperature really was.I would not recommend this aquarium thermometer or buy it again."
4,"Easy to Install, Accuracy in Temperature is a so-so","It's easy, just stick it on the tank and it'll glow the temperature it's currently at. Because it's on the outside of the tank, I'm not sure about how accurate it is. Therefore I didn't rely on having this by itself. I bought another temperature that went inside the tank as well.But so far it seems to read fairly close but I would rely on a real thermometer in the water."
3,Turtle tank thermometer,"As long as you are only looking for a ""general "" temperature this works fine. I don't think the turtles know the difference -"
1,Junk,"(A) Looks different than the picture, which wouldn't have been that big of a deal if it worked. The one pictured goes up to 84 degrees (B) The one I received only goes up to 82 degrees. My tank is warmer than that so thermometer is solid black and not showing any numbers."
3,Easy to read,"I put this thermometer on the bottom left corner of my freshwater fish tank. I use it for a reference point only, as it is not as accurate as my thermometer inside the tank. Good Product works fine, but not needed if you have a thermometer inside the tank."
4,Great and accurate.,"This thermometer is accurate and small. If you ever need to reset it, just run your finger along the thermometer and it should fix it. I've had mine freeze a couple times on rapidly changing temps (for my refill bucket for water changes). It does have an upper limit of 82 degrees though (it can technically measure up to 83), and that means if you are making sure your water is the right temp for changing water, you will have to wait for the temp. of the water to drop below 83 for it to show on the thermometer. Easy to read though, and I highly recommend."
5,work as advertised,"easy to apply. I was concerned that they might not be reading accurately since they are stuck on the outside of the tank (and my tanks are plastic), but I checked with an internal mercury thermometer and it read very close."
2,Dissapointing,"Pretty pictures, but little else redeeming about this. Not a great value. There is no organization to this text, and the paintings/drawings are just okay. The information about the flowers is also not in depth. Save your money for other and better books."
3,Enjoyed Story But!!,"I enjoy all of Amanda Ashley's vampire novels, but I have to say I miss the intense romance that some other authors have. This is all story and very little romance and almost no sex. While that isn't necessarily bad in this case the story though enjoyable didn't alway make sense. It felt set up so that various events could take place to give the characters a chance to do this or that. I could not buy the idea that the heroine could or even would rescue the hero. What came before just didn't lead to this event. The story is contrite and contrived yet I would still recommend it if you like vampire novels that are somewhat sensual but not at all sexual."
3,Good book...,"Desire after dark is the first book of Amanda Ashley that I read. I like the book it have a good history but I thik that the historiy need more element of surprises. For me was very predictable I keep reading the book thinking maybe she going to make some mistake, that maybe something go wrong and the have to meke a different plan ... but never happend. If the bad vampire was to dangerous why the kill him so easy? nothing go wrong? but is a good book, great characters and easy to read"
1,Not that great,"When I found out I had diabetes I bought this book and a few more. One that I do like is the Moosewood Restaurant Low Fat Favorites. The difference between the two is that Moosewood takes commonly available at any grocery store foods, and combines them into new and very delicious entrees. Joslin's book (supposed to be gourmet, but I didn't really think it was) often calls for hard to find ingrediants and the results are really not worth the effort.I have since eliminated diabetes from my health problems and am medication free. This book did not help. If you need one for a basic diabetic guide, choose the Moosewood Low fat favorites. It is really good."
3,Time for a revamp,"This book has some very good insight and suggestions for making life easier after chemo. But, with all the new therapies and drugs, this book needs a good update."
2,Pointless exercise for the me generation,"There's precious little in the book about the meaning of life. Instead, it's a series of little experiences (many of them hopelessly trivial) sent in by various people who rose to the bait of seeing their words and their names in print.This is little more than a collection of the type of personal anecdotes that used to be in publications like The Reader's Digest.A quick and easy way for someone (in this case, the ""editor"") to make money from someone else's input.Give it a miss."
5,Keeps up!!!,"I can pound the bass in my ford ranger and this cap never gives up!! It's small, and easy to install. Highly recommend over electrolytic caps."
3,Morgan Freeman takes on Gene Hackman in Under Suspicion,"Under Suspicion is about a detective played by Morgan Freeman (Kiss The Girls, Se7en) who brings Gene Hackman (Mississippi Burning, Absolute Power) in an interrogation room and starts questioning him on murder and rape cases. This mystery mindboggler does deliver the goods but only up to a vast certain point and then it's all like, ok. Only fueled by the ""kinetic"" power of both Freeman and Hackman and the direction of Stephen Hopkins, examples would have to be all the interrogation room scenes and when Freeman tries to imagine that he is there with Hackman who rewinds his every step. Also starring Thomas Jane and the ever so hot and spicy Moncica Bellucci. Yet again another movie where Freeman plays a cop and Hackman plays a political figure but hey who cares, their good at it."
4,Suspenseful but what the heck happened?,I thought the movie was great. Hackman and Freeman are very convincing in their respective roles. Very interesting use of juxtaposing keeps you guessing the whole way through. I'm not going to give the ending away but I found it very confusing. It's keeping me up at night. If somebody has the answer please email me at maldons@yahoo.com.
3,"Um, just one question....","Entertaining, but the plot has a hole big enough to walk through: It's about the interrogation of a LAWYER. If you're wondering why an attorney (or anyone smarter than a house plant) wouldn't ""remain silent"" and/or demand a lawyer for himself from his high-powered law firm (he was even read his miranda rights)rather than spend two hours undergoing humiliating and incriminating interrogation, well, I'm wondering too! The script doesn't bother to explain this obvious point.The obvious answer is that they wouldn't have a movie.... but isn't the writer supposed to devise some credible explanation? That's why they make the big bucks, after all."
2,Convoluted,"Didn't like it, but it does make you think. Mostly because you can't figure out what's going on half the time. Here's my take on the ending: Hackman's character atually does have a pedophilia problem (first meets his wife when she's 11 and he's like 50+; spends more time with the niece than the wife; has all sorts of pictures of very young girls - including the murder victims) and by confessing to the murders he both acknowledges this and escapes from his wife, whom he can't seem to stomach. It may be that Director Hopkins is making a statement that there's not much difference between the murder's lust and Hackman's lust. Or that appearances are deceiving. Or both. In any event, it's a pretty depressing film. The next video I rented was Rocky and Bullwinkle - at least I could sort out the good guys from the bad guys in that one....."
3,What the................,"Loved it, loved it, loved it - until the end. What's up with that? Was he THAT unhappy? Or did the producer run out of money and have to think of a way to end things?"
1,What's up with that?,"My wife and I have four degrees between the two of us. Not to say that we are the smartest people in the world, but we must know a little of something. And collectively, all we can say is ""What's up with that?"" If you have to discuss and create your own ending, only to come to the conclusion that there is no ending, is obsurd. Maybe Hackman and Freeman should have actually watched the movie beginning to end before they threw it out there for the public to see. ""Hack""man says it all for this movie. My wife and I both had all of the respect in the world for these two fine actors before this movie, but now all I can say is ""stick to acting."""
3,GOOD BUT...,"Hackman and Freeman steals the show. Even Thomas Jane is ok as the auxiliar cop. But, can somebody please tell me: WHO THE HELL WAS THE KILLER ????!!!!"
1,Big Stinker,You'll love the first 99% but will hate yourself for wasting your time after seeing the last 3 minutes.Don't waste your time or money.
1,sour final note for an aftertaste,The plot was illogical. And no real or good explanation can be given for the last 10 minutes which make no sense. There were some interesting tricks with distortions of time/space/setting and all the acting was good - the end was implausible and nonsensical. I frittered away almost two hours of my life to see what could have been an otherwise good movie screw up at the last.... So this is my revenge. Don't see this turkey.
4,"Excellent Acting, Disappointing Ending","""Under Suspicion"" is a story of a harrowing cross examination that claws to prove that an esteemed lawyer has murdered a 12 year old girl. Henry Hearst (Gene Hackman) is a lawyer living in Puerto Rico with a beautiful young wife. Harry is brought into the local police station before a Charitable Fund-Raising event he has agreed to support and give a speech. The local police captain (Morgan Freeman) and his eager assistant Detective Owens (Thomas Jane) ask Harry what he was doing before he discovered the body of the young murder victim.Harry has trouble keeping his story straight and as clues add up against him the angst of his situation builds. Then after two long hours of dredging up painful personal stories and nebulous evidence, the final scene falls flat. Evidently the message is ""Who is telling the truth?"" Don't jump to conclusions.Although the acting is top notch and grabs your attention, the ending is a total disappointment."
2,Bizarre to the End,"Here's a film with two great actors that seemed to muddle through the script and plot. Maybe it's cause I worked a full day before seeing this, but I kept falling asleep. Hackman is a guy accused of a rather heinous crime, and Freeman is the cop trying to tie him to the crime. The whole film is basically one long interrogation. I thought that the film dragged on, but the end actually tied everything together nicely, and made for a well written closure to an otherwise ""blah"" movie. If you want to see Gene Hackman in a better role, take a look at ""The French Connection""."
3,Good...but the end,The movie was actually very promising until the end. Pedophilia was treated almost lightly and there were some unnecessary and very disturbing discussions and details thrown in which really can be very traumatizing to those who have had experience in the area or who have children.The end was very disappointing and just kind of dropped off. The fact that the wife almost appeared to run back to him and be sorry at the end was very creepy considering the things that he admitted to and she witnessed. That blew it for me.
1,DREADFUL IN EVERY WAY,"What on earth were Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman thinking? Not only did they agree to act in this total stinker but they PRODUCED it too! That means they put up their own money to bomb in such a big way.This movie is not as bad as BAD LIEUTENANT (my worst vote of all times)but it's alarmingly close. The heavy-handed director gives up innumerable close-ups of Freeman looking questioning and Hackman looking exasperated. Then there's the really poor choice to stick Freeman in the flash-back scenes as an onlooker who speaks. The plot d-r-a-g-s along and the ending, apparently trying for a rip-off Sixth Sense effect, is just plain stupid.No viewer could possibly be expected to care for any of these stock characters. Save your rental fee--and for heaven's sake, don't waste your money on owning this flop."
3,GOOD MOVIE FROM START TO MIDDLE,"I enjoyed the body of this movie. The plot was intriguing, though slightly riddled with clichés, and the well-acted characters developed convincingly -- how could they not, the two big Hollywood tykes (Hackman, Freewood).Some of the reviews here about the movie's unexplained ending baffle me because I think that the power of suggestion was precisely the point. I'd also have liked to have known more about a few things, but that's a minor gripe. It's a near-perfect film, had they just tied some loose ends in the finale for the general public.A film for those of us out there who crave good performances and dialogue. Recommended rental."
2,Decaffeinated &#65533;Pure Formality&#65533;,"It seems to me that ""Under Suspicion"" was inspired by the great French film ""Pure Formality"". There are a lot of similarities between them. In both movies there is a ""duel"" between a suspect and interrogator. Both movies are set in the police station. In both movies there is a psychological drama and an unexpected finale. Also there is a love story and a final redemption of the main character. But the French movie has an otherworldly and mystical twist while ""Under Suspicion"" stays totally secular.Although ""Under Suspicion"" is not a complete lemon, the ending is a big disappointment. On the other hand, in ""Pure Formality"" not only acting is great; but the ending also is awesome. If ""Under Suspicion"" is worth watching at all, it is only because of some interesting filming techniques and great soundtrack, inspired by the Puerto-Rican Carnival. Both Hackman and Freeman are good actors, but their talents unfortunately were wasted in this film."
3,"Good story, but the end doesn't hold up","This is a suspenseful tale with good acting and many twists and turns. Hackman and Freemen are excellent. The plot was sound for most of the film, and it held together...until the end. The problem is that the movie (which is to say, the screen play writer) violated a cardinal rule @ endings--one must provide the viewer with an ending that is satisfactory/coherent/makes sense. This movie leaves that out. I'm not saying that an ending cannot be ambiguous--but it at least has to say something. Here, we get a twist at the end that is not explained, then the movie ends. Also, there's just too mush in here that is unbelievable--Hackman's a lawyer in the film, yet allows himself to be questioned for hours without consel? If he is the killer, why did he report the 2nd body to the cops? And Freeman's sidekick detective is totally unrealistic and shoul dhave been written out of the story altogether."
4,Just fine for the price,"What can you say about plastic wheelcovers? These fit your generic 17"" steel wheels just fine, and the clip system used seems like it would hold on tight no matter what. And from twenty feet away or so they look remarkably like the 17"" alloy wheels common on late'90s-mid'00s Chevy and GMC half-ton trucks. No complaints here."
5,This I have really enjoyed.,"OK, you are a Christian and there are questions that you have that you in the past have been told you accept on faith. I have come to the conclusion that you are told this a lot by people who don't have an answer even though these things have nagged at them also.Solving Bible Mysteries is only so big and it can't answer every question you have ever had or ever will, but the book hits some big ones and restores your faith in the thought that there are some answers that can be had, answers that don't insult you if you think at times.This has been a delightful read so far and my book is all highlighted and underlined and I propose to go through the book in detail the next time through once I'm done with just reading the book for the fun of it."
3,One sided,"This was an ok book to read, just a little to one sided for my taste, but still a good book."
1,"Appalling, destroyed by terrible camera work","I have seen the live performance for Saltimbanco and I loved it so much that I cried at the end of the performance. I own the DVD's for Quidam and Dralion, and found both to be amazing. If I had to rate the three I would have Quidam as 11 out of 10. Dralion 7 out of 10 and Saltimbanco 1 out of 10. I just cannot believe that they have released such a terrible piece of work. When watching Saltimbanco on DVD I felt like I had been transported back to 1982 when VHS was hot technology. This was not what I expected. This product was destroyed by the terrible camera work. Lights shine into the camera, the camera's are obviously being held by a bunch of guys in the audience."
2,There's better to be had,"Anyone expecting the lush extravagance of Journey of Man, the wry enchantment of Quidam or the dazzlement of the new Varekai is in for a severe disappointment. The music verges on the unendurable, with whole performances drowned in the worst kind of smooth jazz with moments of 80s synthesizer schlock. The talent of the acrobats and aerialists is matched only by the fetor of their wardrobe, an unimaginably hideous panoply of dreck, sort of 'punk rock on an acid trip' meets 'revenge of the psycho hairdresser.'There are a handful of bright moments -- a 'family' scene at the beginning that was quite touching, a nimble group of pole-climbers, and some lithe bungee-aerialists toward the end. The lead singer is striking and has a beautiful, ethereal voice - but someone should shoot her costume designer.My overall opinion is that Cirque du Soleil offers better fare for the price. Check out Varekai, Quidam, Dralion, or the Journey of Man, all of which are much superior."
4,Review of Protec Professional Violin Case,I am very happy with the Protec Professional violin case. I have been a professional violinist for 30 years and travel quite a biot with my violin. I also travel on my bicycle to rehearsals and concerts with my violin on my back using the wonderfully designed and user friendly backstrap attachment for the case. The case is very strong and light enough to be comfortable and for me to feel secure travelling with it on my back. It is the kind of case that I feel could serve me well for many years.
5,Awesome!,"This stripped down cd makes an immediate impact. Incredible harmonies and rhythmically engaging. Jen Wood is truly a talent to be reckoned with. Her songs will have you toe tapping and singing while at the same time, her music will send an emotional charge right through your bones. BUY BUY BUY!!!"
4,Good job for the price,"These nails survived shipping to us just fine. They seem to be of a more ductile metal than other 1 3/4 roofers we use in that price range, e.g., griprite. They drive easier from the gun and aren't as brittle so the heads don't snap off if you have to pull them, but they have a tendency to bend more when pounding by hammer. They seem to hold as well as a nail that length should. Occasionally in cold weather the lower wire between nails snaps before the nail advances (this happened in different model roofing nailers) creating a jam easily cleared by advancing the nail manually.A solid product for the price, but it might be worth paying for a slightly more reliable brand if it would cost more in labor over the life of the whole box to pay guys to clear the occasional jam."
5,Zao Never Fails,"With all the metal bands going mainstream lately (Underoath, Atreyu, etc.) I didnt know what to expect from ""Funeral Of God"". The concept of the album is intriguing. Zao explores the possibility of God turning his back on humanity for turning our back on Him and the apocalypse which ensues. Every song on the album is good although some are way better than others. I dont know how Zao continues to make such amazing records through all their changes but they do and they did with ""Funeral of God"" so pick it up."
3,"let's stop singing for Buddah, while we're at it!!","The music is generally solid, surpassing everything since ""Liberate"", however, there is a general lack of the sonic greatness that was prevailant on ""Blood & Fire"" and ""Liberate"".Sure, the production is great, and the music is grinded out flawlessly, but it just feels hollow during the majority of the playing time. There are a couple of strong tracks, and only one or two clunkers, but all in all, nothing I'd write home about....and yet, there is some strange addictive quality to the album that makes me put it in the cd player once every couple of days."
2,the worst album since Dan joined the band,"Zao was probably one of the most unfocused bands out there today. Their purpose and direction have been all over the place. So to attempt to bring the band into focus they made this concept album. While the concept may be cool enough, the music is another story. In their own words the change was supposed to be about the music, but I hear no evidence of this. I found the album to be dispassionate and uninteresting. It just lacks that same gritty groove that I found appealing. I tried to give it a chance, but I just couldn't get into it. After about 10 listens I deleted it out of my mp3 player. This is nowhere in the same league as ""Parade of Chaos"" or ""Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest."" While I'm sure they thought this new direction would bring them a wider audience base, that audience doesn't include me. Whatever you're doing to try to focus your direction, please stop it Zao."
4,AWSOME,"Zao, one of the legends of hardcore, just released this one, and I have to say, I like it so much more than the others. His voice is piercing when he screams, which adds to the awsomness. This cd is more melidoc than the others and is their best. They stay true to themselfs, and their beliefs. Zao is one awsome band that shouldnt be taken lightly. Classic band and album."
4,A very strong attempt...,"This album is probably the strongest attempt Zao has ever put out since their Liberate album, complete with a solid concept of how the world would be like if God decided to cease to exist. Lead singer Dan Weyandt states in an interview from a magazine that one loses a sense of value of someone or something until it's taken away.Aside from their strong conceptual endeavor, they've also advanced to a more melodic, mature and darker sound. Many of the melodies in the album are catchy and easy to get into. However, it seems that Dan's vocals somewhat falters in its execution, namely in several songs where he places his screams in congruence with the strumming of the guitars. Hence, for every strum, Dan's vocals blends in with it, thus reducing the efficacy of his vocals. Furthermore, some songs sound overly repetitive and somewhat dumbed down to mere repetition.Nonetheless, one would find that the album as a whole is quite addictive, even with its minor flaws."
3,pretty heavy ((( * * * 1/2 STARS))),"yeah i pretty much know they are chirtian band but i certainly dont like this album for being one.heck not really interested. no i like it cuz its brutal and dark. nasty drums rythyms,pummeling hard core guitars and demonic vocals check out guitar breakdowns in ""the rising end"" interplayed with steel solid drum ryhtyms and some of darkest and doomiest essence in the hardcore maybe make this one of the most mirthless and dark of its brethren. but on its own which it should be looked at as, its at least refreshing among the pack of the metalcore thats on the spot light."
4,really good.,"Zao is lot a more melodic here and not as heavy as they were on for example, (Self-Titled). Dan's vocals sound simply amazing, especially on the smoking tracks Breath of the Black Muse and Praise the War Machine. Even though theyre not too heavy, look at every other Zao album. They all sound different. Next, Zao is either going to make a brutally heavy and crushing album or a much softer album with a lot of siging to cater to their soon to be ""Warped Tour"" fans. Hopefully Zao will pump out the heaviness on their next opus. But, make no mistake, this is much much much better than all the so called ""metalcore"" out there now like Atreyu. Zao are pioneers and everybody should stop listening to these new bands and give Zao a chance, theyre alot better."
5,ANOINTED!!,"Beautiful: Anointed by God, and Gifted of God to Proclaim His Praises! Rebecca has a beautiful voice, unlike any other. The CD reveals it all. But more importantly, apparently, she has the anointing of God upon her life and her music. She stands out in her class! Her voice, combined with God's anointing, gives her music is a powerful melody that draws you closer to God. I would recommend the ""God Says You Can"" CD to anyone, of any age. If you enjoy Contemporary Christian and Contemporary Gospel, Rebecca's CD is a must have to add to your collection of Gospel and Contemporary Christian Greats. Rebecca is on her way to the top. I don't believe the Lord would have it any other way."
5,"""A Multi-Millon Dollar Voice of Voices""","The songs that are ministered on this CD, without question, flow from the young, loving heart of a true worshipper, and vessel of honor! As these songs are ministered, they bring lasting encouragement, great comfort, hope, and real joy to the listener. Now, the song entitled ""God Says You Can"", ministers sustaining encouragement;whereas the song entitled ""Cry No More"", ministers emotional healing and Godly comfort. Each of the songs on the CD ministers effectively to a specific need, thus making this a MUST BUY! May God continue to make his face to shine upon this young artist as she walks in her purpose and destiny. Let's get out and support her, because she is such an incredible blessing! And always remember, that ""THE BEST IS YET TO COME FOR HER, AND IT'S COMING QUICKLY."""
5,That's My Girl,"You go girl. I thank God upon my every remembrance of you. I am thankful to God that He is blessing you each and everyday. Continue to chase after God and He will give you the desires of your heart. I am waiting for my next CD, and your Stellar Award, and your Grammy, and your Dove, and so on, and so on!!! TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL GIRL. And always remember, I knew you when . . . (Love Lynn - mommy #2)"
2,Not as informational as I would've liked,"This book is full of colorful pictures, but I'm afraid short on the information I hoped to find within. If you are just begining to make your own cosmetics, this MIGHT have information you can use; however, for the person hoping to find new information concerning formulas, etc., no such luck."
3,Prinz Eugen,"The book is good, however, as it is a translation, it can be a bit slow at times. As far as I can tell this is the only history of the 7 th SS Mountian Division ""Prinz Eugen"" available in English. A must have for those interested in the Waffen SS of WW2 in general."
5,No Second Rate Stuff Here,"This obviously is an overlooked album and it's an excellent choice for those who are fed up with George Benson's overplayed titles.If you want the proof that the sound is of a great quality :Narada Michael Walden produced and arranged the whole album, except for one title (secrets in the night) which was produced and arranged by... Kashif. These 2 names mean Perfection."
2,No Rocksteady Here!,"I would have given this 2CD set 3 stars if i hadn't been expecting something else. Generally i'm very impressed with Proper's releases but this one was a major disappointment to me. I was lead to believe that there were a lot of Delroy's Rocksteady classics on this album, but that is not the case. Most, if not all of the recordings on these CD's are Bunny Lee produced recordings from the 70's. And the songs on here that are considered to be Delroy's classic Rocksteady recordings are 70's remakes of those songs, and not the Studio One originals from the late 60's.Now mind you this is a pretty good collection of Delroy's material and there are some good tunes in here. However, i bought the CD thinking that it had a lot of the Studio One Rocksteady cuts on it and it doesn't. My disappointment with this set lies in my own expectations.Buyer beware, look elsewhere for the truly classic Delroy Wilson cuts."
1,Original Recordings,"I was disappointed in the tracks on the CD. "" I'm In a dancing mood."" I wanted to hear the original songs, not re-recordings. I Knew Delroy Wilson and he had a great voice. I don't know what happened after I left Jamaica in 1973. His voice deteriorated so drastically, that it pains me to listen to his later recordings. Spit in the sky, Lion of Judah, etc., were early recordings done at Studio One. I would like to see more original recordings of Delroy and other stars. On a scale of 1-5! Is there anything less than one?"
2,Glooby and sticky,"This is nothing like the normal Astroglide. It's really thick and doesn't have the same consistency as normal astroglide. I would say it's more like gravy.Huge downside is it dries quickly, leaving you and your partner uncomfortable. Stick with the original, stay away from this."
1,The worst stickiness ever,"Like others have mentioned, this stuff starts off working really well. But after about 10 or 15 minutes, this stuff gets really really sticky. Painfully sticky, and doesn't wash off easily either. It is such a gross feeling to have after.I've tried this for anal, and a flesh light, and the results have been mostly the same."
4,Great,A great product for the price. Very easy to clean up after as well as feels great. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a cheap yet effective lubricant.
1,Sticky slippery and messy false advertising,Y astroglide is really popular it's not for me cuz it's like putting corn syrup on ur u know wat cuz of the glycerin so I would recommend a glycerin and parabin free lube such as durex play more not tingling or warmer overall I'm disappointed with this products performance although might as well use it since I waste seven bucks that could have been used to buy the durex play more lube but this with it's false ads tricked me and stupidly I fell for it
3,Over The Top View of Supposed Perfection,I got about halfway through this book and couldn't stand the back slapping tummy rubbing view of perfection portrayed by the author. I lent the book to a colleague who has worked at Southwest and they agreed. Perhaps if you hadn't worked in the game it would be a better book. problem is Southwest probably deserves a better book because they are a great success story - just don't have an author crow so hard about it and detract from the true story. I rate the book three stars (possible generous) simply because I couldn't bear to read it all. For the money I recommend 'Hard Landing' by Petzinger as far more worthwhile ('From Worst to First' is also better).
2,Good data poorly developed construct,"The book provides a lot of really useful information about Southwest Air. The problem is that the 'relational coordination' construct has no theory. Southwest is successful for lots of reasons from a clearly defined product, well specified work, good structure, a focus on 'set-up' time (which is what Toyota excells at)...all of these are useful specifics. But when the concept/construct of 'relational coordination' is developed all those situational details are stripped away. The result of this are 10 well described but abstracted practices that hold little value in guiding what a firm should do first/next."
1,Poor quality,This video is a waste of time. It looks like it was filmed with a home video camera and the sound quality is like listening to a concert through a cell phone.Do not waste your money.
2,"Get the real deal, this isn't it","I bought this for my 2.5 y.o. because his 5 y.o. brother has a Kettler Kettcar and I thought this would be a better size for him. First, let me say that I did not pay the current price of $159.95. I paid $49.95 and I will say that it's probably worth that much. The steering wheel is really hard to turn (even the 5 y.o. has trouble with it) and the pedals are pretty hard to turn for a young one. The description may say that the wheels are rubber but they are not. They're the same old plastic wheels that crack over time and that have no traction. I do appreciate the pushbar because it looks like I'm going to be helping the young one quite a bit. If you're going to spend the money get a Kettcar. They really are much better and worth the money."
1,Don't waste your money!,The racer has broken within six months. The hard plastic steering wheel just snapped right off and no way to repair it. Plus it is really hard to petal for little kids. I would get a real tricycle or a bike instead of wasting money on this.
4,good solid watch with some look adjustements neede,"I got it from Amazon very fast (faster than I estimated - thanks)being really pleased at seeing it first time out of the box. Indeed is a heavy watch (cannot be forgotten, it,s absence will be noticed :) ) but should be considered that is fully stainless steel case and mineral glass not plastic. Till now works very well, even say ""hunt"" :)) , seriously is a strong and precise watch.What I don't like: orange display light and camouflage belt. Would have been great a solid black leather belt, considering that the display colour is black, but this can be fixed later.Anyway, if you need a solid and precise watch go fo it.I forgot about battery life, is specified 10 years, now I have to wait and see... :))"
1,bad,"the product came to be if your battery does not change myself for coming back to live in another country, but with the remains of great products"
5,Easy Product to use,I have had my Fellows Laminator for a few years now and have used the 3 mil paper mostly. The 5 mil definitely adds to the stiffness of your document and bonds very well without any bubbles or streaks. Easy to trim if needed.
5,Big fan of 5 mil,"Until receiving these, I was using 3 mil lamination sheets to help me protect/preserve printables that I was using with preschoolers. Now that I have sampled 5 mil, I do not think I will go back. The 5 mil sheets work great and provide a little protection to my print outs. I ran through about 15 last night (on my Fellowes Saturn 95 laminator) and did not have any crinkles or issues. I highly recommend these."
2,"Clear enhancement, but STATIC hurts rating","Not sure if it's the 100 pack or not, but I bought 2 of these with the same results for both packs. LOTS of static electricity which makes is very hard to center the pages I'm trying to insert. Even lifting the top piece, very difficult. I've purchased about 10 of the 150 packs from Staples, but was getting a little expensive so tried this. Takes me so much time with these I'll head back to Staples for the 150 pack. (These were $50 for 200 pages shipped, Staples was $60 for the 150 pack after tax)"
5,Great quality!,"These pouches are at great quality for laminating permanent signs...Very substantial! Make everything I laminate look very professional! Great price, too. Much cheaper than the office supply stores!"
5,Works Great,"I purchased these sheets 4mths ago and I just used them this week. I used them to laminate pictures I cut out of magazines that I'm using to teach my daughter the phonetic alphabet. I also laminated letters I wrote on felt to correspond with the pictures. There were a few air bubbles since the felt is so thick, but I was able to seal the edges. I'm halfway through with the pack and I'll be ordering some more sheets. You will get your money's worth as this is a great product."
5,"Consistent, High Quality Laminating Pouches","Length:: 1:31 MinsI thought the best way to describe the pouches was to make a video of them. Just as a word of caution, feed your pouches 'seam' side through the laminator. It helps tremendously. All of the issues I have had with hot laminating pouches are generally caused by this. I like the 5 mil pouches over the 3 mil pouches as they are much more robust and less prone to creases. While I have never tested how 'thin' you can make the seam along the loose edges, I have been successful with 1/16th to 1/8th of material. I try to showcase this in the video."
5,Fellowes Pouches Work Well,"With a Fellowes laminator I have laminated several sizes of paper objects. When laminating papers smaller than 8 1/2 x 11 it is important to leave a sealed margin around the whole object when cutting otherwise the seal will not be waterproof. If the margin is kept I have found the laminated papers will stay unmarred by a driving rain storm. We make signs for our stand at a farmers' market so have plenty of water to contend with, shaken off of vegetables or on a rainy day. No problem with the Fellowes laminated paper signs. If you are under the gun to get laminations out quickly be sure to allow time for the laminator to warm up before you can make signs. Also, I make sure that I can ""receive"" the laminated pages after they flow through the laminator. That way they will be sure to ""dry"" flat. In other words I would suggest not attempting to use the laminator unattended."
5,"Nice Thickness, Plus--Make Your Own Dry Erase Boards!","I like both the Fellowes Hot Laminating Pouches and the Scotch brand. Both are good quality and laminate well.The 5mil thickness is definitely preferable to the 3mil for documents. The difference is a stiff and sturdy item that is less likely to bend or fold. The pouch worked equally well on cardstock and thinner paper. While a bit curled when coming out of the laminating machine, setting it to cool on a flat surface removes the curl. Make sure that you don't try to pull the pouch through while laminating--the machine will do the work for you.What I love using these laminating pouches for is to create custom dry-erase boards for checklists, shopping lists, chores, or even cute personal 'white boards'. Use standard dry erase markers and erasers. Just stick some self-adhesive magnets on the back, and you can put up the boards on a fridge! Use pushpins to put them on a cork board...oh so easy!"
2,Just not up to par,"After using laminating pouches for years, I wouldn't consider myself an expert on the item, but I am expert on what suits my needs and what is acceptable to me. These pouches did not work as well as expected, in fact they were a huge disappointment. Plagued with air bubbles and ""foggy"" patches, the finished projects were not usable (and definitely not sellable, for those who use their laminaters for craft projects). I generally use Scotch and Universal pouches and these Fellowes pouches were far inferior, actually ruining some of the laminated photos and pages. I would never purchase this item after seeing such poor results."
2,Disappointing based on other Marisa Monte works,"It's a music CD with some videos. Songs are great, but since I already had the CD, it did not add much..From the general top quality of work from everything that comes from Marisa Monte I was very disappointed. Have most of her collection, guess will not use this much.. Anybody wants to buy it??"
5,Marisa Monte is a living angel sent to prove there is a spirit of love!,"Buy everything you can find of Marissa Monte's music! Everything!, including CDs with her tracks featuring duets with David Byrne and Carlinhos Brown and Arnaldo Antunes on many Luaka Bop Compilations! Marissa Monte's talent is self-defined but I also say She is one of those various Brasilian Godesses!!"
2,Not Impressed,"I didn't like this CD very much. A couple of songs sound alright but I really don't like the vocals, kind of whiny. A lot of the songs sound the same. Not a fan."
4,Nice Debut,"Systematic is gooing places. Their first single ""Deep Colours Bleed"" was a great song and the cd flows well... Not the best cd but it is a very good album from a new rock group."
1,Just another rip off,"First thing I thought when I heard this album was the band Helmet. They do it much better and are the first. This is just one of those copycat artists. The cd is good, but not when you steal from other bands. Who knows, have of the people listening to this band probally don't know who helmet is. Well kids, go check them out."
4,Systematic: Prime example of heavy rock,"Before listening to this album I did not have the faintest idea who were Systematic or what they sung. This CD was purchased by accident and by the time I realized the mistake it was too late. So I continued the purchase and a few days ago I listened to the album release for the very first time. 'Systematic' is relatively a new band on the heavy rock scene and while it's riffs and chords are highly repetitive song to song, the songs are totally enjoyable and not to lite. Infact this is a prime example of heavy rock with a touch of nu-metal. This album 'Somewhere In Between' is almost a hour long with 3 good songs, 'Glass Jaw', 'Slowburn' and 'If Only'. Fans of Staind, Fuel and Godsmack should enjoy this flavoured heavy rock-nu/metal extravangza band."
3,George Clinton's Stanky-Style,"""Hey Man, Smell My Finger"" recalls earlier days of Funkativity, drawing on the earlier golden-age works of Parliament and translating them into the era of rap. The album is ripe with samples and riffs from the old school and has a solid thumping bass end. Some tracks are better than others, ""Martial Law"" and ""Paint The White House Black"" being two good examples of well preserved funk in a modern setting, while some others are competent but not so memorable funky grooves. There are appearances by other artists such as Queen Latifa that reinforce the unbroken tradition of funk from its roots to its current incarnations. If you are into the P-Funk, this is a chapter of history you should have."
4,Excellent Security book,"Excellent very extensive security book. A very good reminder for the preparation of the CISSP exam. (is one of the official recommended books).I passed my CISSP exam, because of this book.Jako BoonekampCISSP #97956The Netherlands"
1,Stay Away,"The majority of this DVD consists of comments & interviews with critics and musicians having no connection to LZ. The commentary is uninformative, unless you know nothing about the group. The live footage is only brief clips, with no complete songs. If you want to see Zeppelin live, buy any of the other authorized DVD's (""Song Remains the Same"", etc.). You will regret spending money on this one."
3,"Not bad, some vital information and rare footage of Zep",I thought this insider DVD wasn't bad. Some of the same commentators as the Deep Purple Inside DVD. Pretty much the same setup. Start with Led Zeppelin I through Led Zeppelin IV with commentary from various UK session men and critics (most I've never heard of here in the US). They talk about various songs with video clips none of which is shown all the way through. The songs are all live from BBC or Australian footage. The one thing that I got from this DVD was the fact that Jimmy Page ripped off the Stairway to Heaven intro chord progression from the band Spirit's song Taurus. It's on Spirits first album and you can hear it on the free audio sample. I'll never listen to Stairway the same again.
4,Very good introduction to functional coverage,"I must admit only reading the first few chapters, as all I am interested in is functional coverage. I will some day read the rest of the book (I hope).Commenting on the parts that I did read so far - I found this book an excellent learning tool. I had to learn how to write functional coverage in e, and this book was very valuable in getting me started, both with basic concepts, as well as examples. The example involving the wood stove is excellent. Unlike the documentation available from (Cadence), which is highly fragmented, Andy Piziali did an excellent job providing examples of complete - start - to -finish solutions."
5,A great introduction to functional verification coverage,"In his forward to Piziali's book, Harry Foster, of Jasper Design Automation, says that this is ""the first book to introduce a useful taxonomy for coverage metric classification."" I agree that ""useful taxonomy"" describes this book well. I think it would be hard to find a more clear and complete introduction to functional verification coverage concepts and methods.As an added bonus, this book is a good read. Piziali has a passion for verification coverage and a passion for language. The result is prose that not only is clean and easy to follow, but that also infects you with the excitement Piziali feels for his subject."
5,Excellent CD,"I love this Cd it has original beats with tight baselines and smooth lyrics. I would reccomend this Disc to anyone. I couldn't believe none of my friends new about this group. But they do now and Love it. ""Me and My Hustlas Got to eat"" is one of my favorite songs. Keep up the good work guys."
5,In any motorcycle lovers collection,A dated documentary of motorcyle racing in America. You cant call yourself a motorcycle enthusist without this in your collection. If you know where each of these genre's of bike racing are today then you can see we've come a long way and that while NASCAR may be America's motorsport we have as rich a tradition in the motorcycle racing as any country even though Harley cant hang much to my dismay.If you dont own this movie you dont know jack about bikes.
5,ON ANY SUNDAY,If you have any motorcycle movies or ride you must have this. It has been the classic motorcycle movie for almost 40 years. I still get stoked every time I watch it. I have had the good fortune to talk to many of the riders featured in it and they are real people who happen to have a real passion for motorcycles. It's good enough that I went AWOL (didn't get caught) in 1971 to see it for the second time.
4,Best motorcycle movie?,"I liked this film but can't quite agree with calling it the ""best motorcycle movie ever"" (as it was advertised to me by other people). For that, it is too one-sided on dirt. I'm missing more road racing. I would have loved to see some of the now legendary racers and bikes of this period's GP circuit.Besides the motorcycling aspect I see this film as a document of a particular time: the overall feel is very upbeat, and people's looks are different compared to nowadays. That made it interesting to me in itself."
3,Kinda dorky,"I found this movie/documentary to be rather sophmoric and goofy, but worth watching anyway. Some motorcycle magazine editors feel they have to mention this, ""EPIC"", tale in their respective publications every month, raving about how wonderful it is and how much it influenced their lives. I just don't see it. I grew up in the 60""s and 70""s and have been riding motorcycles for 39 years. I certainly didn't need Bruce Brown to tell me to."
5,Who needs football...,"Even though filmed more than 30yrs ago , this is without a doubt, the best motorcycle movie ever made! Even if you don't own or ride a motorcycle, you will enjoy this movie. It will make you laugh, it will make you cringe, and it will keep you entertained every second.Just make sure you have this, the original Bruce Brown version - the remake (On Any Sunday II) is a cheap ripoff and sucks."
5,Classic!,Dont miss this one! Hard to not feel enthusiastic and nostalgic about motorcycling watching this film. Great great great!
5,Remember when,"I saw this when it came out, wonderful to look at the state of the art long ago, How did they do it"
5,On Any Sunday,"On Any Sunday is, simply put, one of the best sports documentaries ever produced. It was one of the first movies I saw as I kid, and since then I have watched it whenver I can. Affectionate and witty, OAS gives a clear overview of the sport of motorcycle racing, showing the both its beauty and its brutality. We see motocross, speedway, dirt bikes, desert racing, superbikes, ice racing, hill climbing and trials riding, plus a few things I probably forgot.Of course, the film was shot about 30 years ago (it can't be that long!) so it only shows the sport as it existed in 1970 or so, but as snapshot of a time and a group of people, it is nothing less than brilliant.When I saw it was out on DVD I pounced immediately. The only quibbles I have are with the opening titles (cheesy 80's-vintage video) and the sound. The narrator's voice only comes out of the left speaker. Still, considering that this was not produced in dolby surround sound, it's a very minor complaint."
5,The classic motorcycle movie!,"Anyone who rides a motorcycle or wishes to learn about the history of motorcycling would likely enjoy this movie. In fact, anyone who is amused by watching older movies and shows that depict how some things have changed and other things never seem to change over the years would have fun watching this. I recently had the distinct pleasure of meeting Malcolm Smith, one of the riders who was featured in this movie. He is now in his late 60's and still enjoys riding. I can highly recommend this movie!"
5,Wonderful movie.,"I gave away my copy years ago and just recently ordered this for my boss who's never seen it and she's been riding bikes for years.Wonderfully nostalgic movie covering all aspects of motorcycling in the '70s. Funny in places, exciting, and great riding memories.It's so amazing to see what they did with motorcycles back then compared to the technology of today. Great slow motion scenes. My all time heroes - Malcolm Smith and Steve McQueen are fabulous."
5,"An appealing, even nostalgic, overview of motorcycling.","This movie was a surprise on its first viewing, and continues to delight. The film maker is able to capture, in spite of his documentary style, the joy, spirit and courage of his subjects.At the time of its first release, Lawwill and Smith were known to but a few ""hardcore"" hobbyists. However, the movie gave them, and other characters, an immediate, universal appeal. I was fortunate to see the film in its first release. The audience was comprised of many non-motorcyclists, not really aware of the movie's content. Most were surprised, intrigued and delighted."
4,Gift,I got this as a gift for my son. He was thrilled as this is his favorite movie. He rememberd seeing it as a child so was thrilled with the updates. I finally got him something he really liked and not just pretended to like.
5,Super Movie about motorcycling in the 70s.,"For all of us 'mature' people this movie brings back many memories and explains different aspects of the motorcycle industry. People we know are in it, Steve Mcqueen, Malcolm Smith, Mert Lawill, Kenny Pressgrove from Kansas and more. Make sure you have this movie in your library and keep it handy to review with your friends. They've been showing this movie over and over at motorcycle events for years. Enjoy"
5,Awesome!,"Motorcycle enthusiasts, hard core bikers and even those with only a passing interest in bikes will appreciate this DVD. Especially loved the bonus features with Steve McQueen on the making of the movie. Fascinating and fun."
5,Greatest motorcycle movie ever,Greatest motorcycle movie ever and being re-mastered is even better! A must have for any motorcycle enthusiasts. Directors cuts are interesting.
1,wacawac,I purchased this product from Amazon.com in June. Unfortunately I didn't remember where I had gotten them. I had used these in the pasted for my other dogs and they were great. These are terrible. They don't snap open and they don't clean the eye area at all. I would never buy them from Amazon again.
4,not much too say,"I bought these along with a Porter Cable air nailer for some trim work in a remodel project. What can I say? They seem to hold well, and I haven't had a jam after nailing up a couple hundred feet of trim. The bad -- like most things ""made in China."""
5,Nailed It!,"They worked great in my Grizzly 16 gauge nail gun. They do what nails are meant to do, no problems. What more can I say?"
1,This product has still not arrived either - that is 3 from 3 which have not arrived!,This product has also still not arrived. Out of the 3 books which I have ordered none have arrived.
3,He should burn in hell for being this funny!,"First of all, I got this book as a birthday present, and it probably didn't come from Amazon.com (but I've bought other stuff from here). Anyway, I don't know /where/ Scott Adams came up with the idea of talking animals, but it works. Now when I walk around my office, I can tell that my secretary is really a dog in heat, and my boss is really a donkey, and my cubicle-mate is really a rooster. That must be why Adams' animals all walk on two legs! Now they've made it into a TV show, and that's stupid, though, because animals on TV don't talk."
3,mancora,"quality was excellent, only thing i hate it was widescreen, cutting part of the picture off. the studios should make both version. thank you"
2,I haven't been happy since I bought it,It's nothing major but it's all the minors that add up. While setting up the lathe it was the little things that got to me. I guess I'm spoiled from using the machines we have at work but I wouldn't buy one again ( any 7 x whatever lathe) for any price. This is not just for the Grizzly product. I think I would save my money and get a larger more capable bench top lathe were I to do it again.Pat
2,Audio,"Audio is not ""clear and concise."" I've tried on two different computers with different sound card settings and still found audio to suffer. I do not feel that this is due to the quality of the playing device as I hear background noises in the recordings. The speaker's style was simply difficult for me to follow comfortably. The Mishna is translated orally, not as text, into English. If you are not concerned about having an English text of the Mishna, then this is a good product. The Hebrew font is clear. I was disappointed that the English translation was available in text format only for the Tanach. Again, if the English translation (oral) is not a concern, then this product is good."
1,The Music is Worse than the Title,"One way trip? More like one trick pony. Make that NO trick pony. This is one of weakest representations of art I have ever been subjected to. Brettell is clearly mesmerized by her own voice - a voice which lacks clarity, depth, control, or range - and belts out one diarrhetic blast after another. Her voice ranges from flat to....flat, but being tone deaf - unfortunately - doesn't seem to hold Brettell back one bit. What Brettell lacks in vocal power she definitely does NOT make up for in writing abilities, as her songs are at once lyrically trite and musically grating - a stupifying combination. Brettell is either surrounded by Yes-men or people who intend to do her harm - this could be the only explanation for the team who allowed the recording of such mind-bendingly bad material."
1,Carousel Accompaniment,"I am disappointed in this product.I was expecting original versions. There are lines cut and the music is rearranged to shorten the scenes.Also, the editing is strange. I thought my CD was damaged.I wouldn't have wasted the money if I had known the versions were adjusted from the original score. Boo!"
4,deep conditioner,"The scent of this tends to irritate my allergies, but it does do a fantastic job of conditioning my hair. I use it sparingly, mostly in the winter when my hair is very dry."
4,"One of my all-time favorite shows, in a less-than favorite format.","I'm getting a Kindle for Christmas, so with that knowledge I finally broke down and bought the digital copies of The Good Guys. I can't believe that it's been years and they still have not released this show on DVD! It's ridiculous.My dad had me test out the Kindle he bought because he wanted to make sure I wouldn't rather have another tablet. I watched part of an episode and was kind of disappointed with how the quality looked. I guess because I was watching a non-HD show on the HD kindle, but it still should have looked better than that. It looked great on my computer. I'm not generally super picky about quality, but it's a little annoying.I would highly recommend this show to anyone, but the quality of the picture did leave a little to be desired."
4,Fun show that didn't last long,This show is funny without being heavy - it's too bad it didn't last long. One of those shows that I can watch over and over without getting tired of it.
5,Great pocket diaper,"A great intro into cloth diapering because they are just like disposables. These are my husband and MILs favorite for their ease and simplicity. I've been using these on my son since he's been born. The microfleece lining is supersoft, and I've never had any problems with leaks or red marks on his thighs."
3,Pluses and Minues,"These diapers have pros and cons for me. I like that the minis are small enough for a newborn, but the Fuzzibunz XS work much better as a small pocket diaper.I have been using the Minis (size xs) on my son - he is about 8lbs. The biggest con, is they leak! No matter how we fold the inserts and if we pad extra in the back or front we have leaks - I think it is because the elastics around the leg are not tight enough. When using the xsmall or minis, I really recommend snapping them up almost too tight to contain fluids. I definitely do not recommend using these at night or after a big feeding.The pros are I do like that they are easy to use and the velcro is very sturdy - they launder well and the colors are great. Also, they are made in the USA which is a big plus for me. I think they will work a little better when my son is larger. I am not totally ready to give up on them (since I made the investment), but there are far better pocket diapers out there!"
1,Poorly Made,"After 7 months of continuous use, these diapers are falling apart. They do not appear to be well made. I would not recommend them and am looking forward to the day when I can finally throw them out and replace them with something better."
5,HAPPY TRAVELS IN PARADISE,"An excellent general travel review of the Micronesian islands. There's so much to see and do in paradise, that it's hard to cover everything in one volume covering over thousands of islands (you can either count at high or low tide) and many, many square kilometers of pristine, and sometimes wild, open ocean. I enjoyed the layout, maps, food and drug choices,and listing some of the more signiciant sights, along with a touch of the local languages and customs. I recommend it for any traveller going through, especially if you ride on the Continental island hopper, and get off at each major airport for a 2-3 days visit. The book is also hardy and fits nicely in a packsack. Good job, Author Levy."
4,In 2011 still the best guidebook for the region,"While prices have changed (a little) and some new establishments have opened this still is the best, most detailed guide to the region.The difficult question is not a hotel's current price (easy to ascertain) but whether you should stay there. This guide provides good descriptions of accommodations allowing you to make an educated choice.Information for independent sightseeing is offered. It's the guide to take with you to guide you while you are in Micronesia.Certain things are outdated/not mentioned for example water activity permits in Palau but those aren't mentioned in that ex Peace Corps 2010 guidebook either."
3,The True Story Behind the Great Imposter,"I have always been a fan of movies from the 40's, 50's and 60's and the film starring Tony Curtis is no exception. After watching it, I wanted to know more about the character and sought out the book. Until I purchased this book, I had a completely different opinion of the achievements of Ferdinand Waldo Demara, Jr. Curtis made him look a whole lot more wholesome than he apparently was in real life. It remains good reading for those interested in how someone could get away with the impersonations Demara did. Conerning the purchese, the book arrived in advertised condition in a reasonable time period. The sevice provided by the seller was good and I would purchase from this seller again."
2,Not so durable,"While the saw performed adequately, I was disappointed with it's longivity. After what I consider a short amount of use (I probably went thru 3 or 4 blades) of relatively light hobby duty, the motor burned out. I'm going to pony up for a more expensive saw the next time."
2,Average Dungeon Crawl,"Firstly, this game was supposed to be a Zelda killer. This game is nowhere near that. Some people may like this game for reasons beyond me, but im going to guess that that number of people is small. The game starts out kind of fun, the first dungeon isnt tedious, and the georama (town maker) is fun to a certain extent. The first boss is too hard for a first boss, and while in the first dungeon, you will find out that weapons break WAY too easily. After you move to the second town, the dungeons get so boring that i had to quit. The dungeons are randomly generated, which basically means no cool zelda puzzles, or cool fight scenes. You end up having to kill all the enemies in the dungeon just for a little bit of fun, and that wears thin after a while. In all, stay away from this game unless you are bored, or want to rent it for a quick play on the weekend."
4,THIS IS AN AWESOME GAME,THIS is sich a good game. I bought it when it was not the neww thing anymore. I couldnt believe i didnt buy it in the first place. Now you can usually buy unexpensive Darckcloud games form [$$$] to [$$$]. It has a million dungeons and no blood or gore but it does have some fighting. If you are a gamer who is up to a challenge buy this game . Me and my friend really like this game and its sequel: DARKCLOUD 2.
5,Challenge of Dark Cloud,Interesting game from the beginning to the end. Character continues to grow and develop with lots of loops and unexpected situations.
5,An intellectual and unique game,Dark cloud is an amazing game. everything from the grapics to the gameplay entice whoever is playing. the story has many small twists and turns for every town that you visit. The weapons system is also extremely good. You find something new every time you play
4,Get Over Zelda!!!!,"Really though, you guys HAVE to get off the zelda topic! i am so sick of you all saying ""rip off of zelda"" and ""i liked zelda better"" if i wanted to hear about this stupid zelda game, i would search for reviews on that! i wanted to hear about dark cloud! now, on to the game. I did enjoy the game, though i did get sick of the dungeon portion of it. i found the ice queen really hard (mostly because i suck at these games) but i liked the fact you had to repair weapons and keep hydrated, though it became annoying after a while. i liked the rebuilding cities and getting allies. so, now i want to try out numba two!"
4,DANG!!,"So amazing just to good!!!!Good-You may not get it and you may stop but when you start, and when you get the orbs to build the city you dont want to stop! It gets boring but after you beet that fat beast it gets evin better!!Tarible-In the Limated zones sometimes they make you use a charitctor that sucks at killing 1 kind of monster. This guy is to slow you haveto push start and start again to move around, to slow man. Some things cost to mutch or you get ripped of better to have little wile you are walking around. Try to learn were eatch button is so fighting will be easyer (bosses)(Skeliton dude)(fat man whith malit} and so on."
1,Phenomanaly Boring!,This was by far the worst game i ever played(this was far repetitive than even the first turok). It had absolutely no plot or challenge. The person who designed this should be beaten. Repeatedly. If you want to buy this just send your money to me. I promise i'll spend it better than you were going to. Do not buy this poor excuse for a game.
1,stink o rama,this game stinks this system stinks and that's why i don't own it nor has it steped foot in my home cause it's all nintendo for me do urself a favor and remember the data nov 5th 2001 GAMECUBE!!!
2,Not what it was cracked up to be,"The game's only fun part is the fact you get to customize the way you build your town, other than that PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, I'm begging you. I could have made a better game in my backyard"
2,World building = fun. Dungeons = crap. Weapon system = UGH!,"Dark Cloud is a Zelda/Actraiser hybrid that seems to try too hard to be perfect on the town buidling part and neglects some things in the dungeon battles. For one, having to throw powder on your weapon to keep it from breaking is stupid. What idiot thought that idea up? Plus the weapon building system is long and complex and not really explained well enough. They should just have better weapons lying in treasure chests as you go along."
2,"What-- exactly, happened?","Upon playing Dark Cloud, I can safely say, I wasn't happy.After all-- it did have sub-par graphics, decent control, and a neat Geo-mod system....but, it just got *so* repetitive!You go around from dungeon to dungeon smacking the ... outta' whatever moves to get a key or gem or what not. Bah! After that, put the gem in, open the door, run down a dungeon, rinse, repeat, lather, and rinse!End-to-end, this game is pretty much blah. I don't have a lot to say, because, well, there's not a lot to say about it. Save your 10-20 bucks for a burger or what not.....heh."
1,this is one of the worst games ive ever played,"i must say, this game is bad. i bought it (big waste of money) and enjoyed it. but when i got through the third dungeon i then realized that the game is very redundent.do not ever buy this game (unless you're under the age of 10) it will not keep your attention and its very boring. i HATE this game."
2,Fun if you like doing the same thing over and over.,"This was a fun game at first, but then it became very repeative. There really isn't much of a storyline (I guess I've been spoiled with Final Fantasy/Lunar/Xenogears type games). The only thing that kept me interested was building up the characters weapons. I certainly don't plan on ever playing it again, though. If you want a true RPG, I'd wait for some of the more promising ones coming out in December."
4,Enjoyable game,"I really liked this game. I was bright and colorful but not too childish. I liked the fact that the point of the game was to retrieve parts of the world and reconstruct it with clues from the inhabitants. The weapon ungrade options were inovative and highly creative. I liked that you could switch between the characters, all of which have different abilities and weapons. Then, there is the fishing. I like that you can take time out to fish and win point that can be exchanged for gems and attribute stones. I played this game for DAYS on end. The monsters got a little repetative, and the maps were all the same, but I still found this game highly enjoyable."
5,great rpg,"This is an awesome rpg for the playstation 2 system. Its very hard, but fun. If you like any combat and attempting to rescue strange worlds, this is a great game. Im in Queens now, and its only getting better. If you like rpgs with pretty darn good graphics, shut up and buy it."
4,"Despite its' similarities to Zelda, Dark Cloud was great.","I love RPGs so, when I heard about Dark Cloud, I decided to check it out. Everybody was touting it to be the next Zelda except for the PS2. Well, they were right. It was like playing Zelda on the PS2 yet its' story made it stand out on its' own. There were too many Zelda similarities to be honest but I thought that Dark Cloud was a great game. The graphics were lush and the georama thing was a neat addition.For a [$$] price tag right now, you can't do too bad for an RPG with Dark Cloud. Rent it out but I bet you'll be getting it once you play into it real good. I did, anyhoo."
4,"Buy it, Play it, Enjoy it","This was a very good game, fun to play, easy to figure out. I have very few complaints. I thought the dungeons were a little to repetitive. They really needed to make the characters and story more indepth. It's like ok I'm the main character, but I have no personality, I was thrown into this adventure (not that I had a choice) but I don't really care. Back to basics the game is simple, fun, and fairly original. A little more indepth and it would be perfect. Dark Cloud 2 anyone?"
4,Great Game But Difficult And Lengthly Weapon Building,"I really loved this game. I especially loved building towns and then being able to walk through them. However, I was unable to get the weapon building. I broke my swords then started over. I finally was able to build up my swords and rings, but was unable to get the rings and swords that I was supposed to get. This is obviously my problem as no one else seemed to have this problem. Great graphics, lots of fun. Worth the price."
4,Ok game,This game is ok i own it but the last boss takes too long to beat.And is to hard to kill.The gameplay is ok but there is still more things that it needs to be a good role playing game.But the game is good
4,A different kind of adventure game.,"OK, so the graphics are definitely launch quality and the dungeons are repetitious, but the sheer old fashioned fun of this title make up for these faults. I loved collecting parts for then building the towns, and the satisfaction in the weapon development is superb. This game is a great value and is sure to provide many hours of fun!"
5,This is a great game,"Dark Cloud is a great game. It is like Nintendo's Zelda but a lot better. It is also a lot like Sim City.You are a charecter named Toan and you must restore the world by recieveing the alta scattered arround dungeons. After recieveing the alta you must rebuild cities. Toan meets many charecters that will join and help you on your quest.(In dungeons, watch out that you weapondosent break or elese you will lose the weapon you worked so hard to buil up)"
1,ugh i hate this game !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i hate this game!!!! it is sooo boring! i haven't even finished th first level!!! the hack and slash is sort of fun though but the weapon dovelopment is totally stupid every time you hit something your sword or whatever loses a point and you have to put this powder so that it doesn't brake. and when your in a dungeon your character gets thirsty and if you don't find water in 30 seconds you die. i reckomend another game to all you rpg fans youd have to be a really stubern jack @$$ to wan't to play this game.
4,The Quest,"When I first bought Dark Cloud, I thought hey this looks like a really cool game. At first when i started playin I'm like hey this is a sweet game. But then I found out some of the things you need to do to manage everything. For instance, you have to maintain a water supply because you have 3 little droplets at the top of your screen, and when it gets depleated, it starts to suck your health down. The one that I thought was ridiculous was u have to maintain the strength of your weapon, it has so many hits before it will break, so you have to have a constant suppley of a healer to bring the strength of the weapon back up. STUPID!! All and all though I pretty much like this game. Graphics are incredible and its the first actual RPG game that will take you some time to beat and not like some 7 hrs. game. The concept is pretty cool. You go around and collect these spere lookin things that contain item, people and housing from your village, and then you build up your villiage however you c fit."
1,Zelda killer? I think not.,"This game was no where near as good as Zelda the graphics were ok, the sword build up was a good idea but other than thatyou might as well sell this game as soon as you get it."
3,Too repititive,"Fun for a while, but it becomes far too repetitive. Not a top RPG, although it has a good combat system and the geo-rama mode (building towns) is fun. Graphics are about Zelda '64 level, and should be better on the PS2."
1,...ATTEMP TO COPY ZELDA,"I wasnt planning on getting this game, but when i went to pick up Twisted Metal Black the store was having a sale if u get 2 games. So i got Dark Cloud. Im now wishing id got Red Faction or NBA Street instead.I usally like RPG games, and im a big fan of the zelda series, but this game is [bad]. The story is completely [bad], and the gameplay is boring and repetitive. Do yourself a favor and dont get this game."
1,so Repetitive,"This is the easiest game ever. its is so repetitive. its not hard at all. you do the same thing on every floor on a level. Its like reliving the same day 17 days in a row. A big waste of time. I love Zelda and other roleplaying games. Its pretty sweet that you can upgrade weapons, but thats all thats i like."
3,Great but repetitive...,"This is a fun and original game. Although, after playing for a while it got sorta old. The weapons you carry gain levels instead of you which was neat, but your character has to get items to become more powerful instead of gaining xp from creatures. Also there was no armor to wear which was disappointing. The rebuilding of cities was easy and time consuming. Fun but repetitive."
1,Very cool game...NOT!,This game [stinks].Its too repetuious and there are no voices.The wepons always breaking really [suck].This is a [rehash] of Zelda.I lost money for this [bad] game so dont buy it.
2,For Ages 13 and younger,...I strongly would recommend you rent this game before buying it if you are over the age of 13 and see just how dumb it is.
2,Bland,"I give the graphics a good grade. The story an F. This game needed more dialog. I did like how it was a lot like soulblazer or actraiser, building the city. the music gets repetitive. I dont really understand why this game got good reviews. Its mediocre at best...."
2,key...water...atla...key...water...atla..key...water..atla..,"After 5 minutes of playing this game I turned it of in disgust, as you had to drink water every 30 seconds, or Toan would die. I later got back to playing it and found it to be bearable, but the dungeons are sooo repetitive. Find key, drink water, find atla, over and over again and again. Where's the challange?"
3,OK,"Dark Cloud is fun, but it is a little more challenging than Dark Cloud 2. If you are a serious RPG fan and love challenges then this game is right up your lane! But don't expect first person shoot ups and high tech graphics. This is an intellectual game with challenging puzzles and teamwork."
4,Fun Game,"I bought this game yesterday at the mall and it surprised me. The game incorporates elements from many different games. It's an rpg, sim city type game, and along the lines of a zelda adventure game. Very addicting game and very fun. Many different gamers would enjoy this game not just an rpg fan."
4,Hurry Up,"Its hard to rate a game that's out, so ill have to go on what i have seen. The bits that i have seen in magazines and on the interenet are making me want this game so bad. All i willsay is that i wish they would hurry up and release this game ASAP"
2,Whats going on,It seams all of u never finished the game it gets soooo hard that u cant stand it and u stop playing its vary annoying.
2,VERY repetitive,"This game is great if you are 12. Anyone older than that should look elsewhere. It is just the same thing, over and over and over and over.....and over again. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,Dark cloud,"This is not your typical RPG you'd expect from sony's new platform.The story line seems childish the majority of the game.The object of the game is to rebuild a town you fight enemies and travel through boards obtaining these floating spheres.While its no Final Fantasy it may please some,me,I find it mediocre."
4,no problems in Milwaukee nailer,I have used about 1500 of these B&C; stainless nails in my Milwaukee 7140 15 gauge nailer without a single jam or other problem.Nails are reasonably well packed for shipment as well (which is more than I can say for certain other brands).Recommended.
3,colors are way off,the quality of the rug is good but the colors from the picture on amazon to the actual product you get in the mail are about 5 shades off...
1,It's a rap! (?),"The CD is just about ruined with ""Tonight is the Night"" Part 1 (rap) - it is the spoken-word intro to a live performance... and it fades out as she starts to sing the song. It is just stupid.And there is not even an hours' worth of music on this disc!"
2,You may be Disappointed,"You may be Disappointed if you expect to receive the staples in neat rows.The first shipment was not packed in such a manner as to prevent the somewhat heavy uncushioned box of staples from slamming about in the oversize shipping box. What emerged was mostly groups of 10-30 staples in small chunks. If Amazon was smarter, they'd wrap the staples in bubble wrap or shrink wrap them to cardboard like they do with books, or at least put them in a smaller size box.This being said, they did overnight me replacements which survived the trip unscathed. The staples themselves, worked just fine!"
3,Donsen Park comes with the Emotional Sickness,"Well when I first heard of DP It was from an ad in the source. Well since then I checked out their site and it was a pretty good site especially for an idie group. It had some samples and although the samples provided had its ups and downs, it still left me wanting to hear more of what these cats had to offer. Thus brings us to present day where I gave up 2 free tickets to a Slum Village, Phife, Mystic concert due to me being ill. Well my friend had gone in my place loved the show but aint heard of one group Donsen Park handed me their full length in payment for the tickets. He said they put on a good show. Well back to the album. It had ups and downs a new sound mainly that had me in awe but the album is more of a 3 1/2 close to 4. Out of 20 track I liked about 16 of them. I cant wait to hear more from DP!!"
5,Good reference,"I was reading a devotional by Chuck Swindoll recently and he said that this is the most useful commentary that he owns. I figured that THAT was a pretty solid endorsement. I own many commentaries but I added this one so that I could be as smart and funny as Chuck Swindoll. Just kidding. Seriously, I am always happy to add useful references to my library. I have not owned it long enough to say more than ""so far, so good."""
4,Bible Study Tool,"Wycliffe Bible CommentaryThis is a great Bible Study Tool, giving a verse by verse explanation,easy to understand. It should be alongside every serious student ofthe Bible. 'Draw night to God and He will draw night to you.'"
2,Maybe OK for Starters,"This commentary has some significant limitations for a Neo-Orthodox Protestant such as myself.The first problem is it is based on the KJV, which while a very poetic translation suffers from obsolete language and scholarship.The second problem is there is little explaination/analysis of the OT Hebrew compared to other commentaries (such as the New Interpreter's Bible).Finally, the commentary tends towards a fundamentalist/literalist view.Still, it is usefull as one needs to look at multiple points of view when studying the Bible or preparing adult Sunday School material. It also might be good for one just starting out in the faith.I have found the International Bible Commentary, International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, and New Interpreter's Bible more useful."
5,Good One-Volume Commentary (Reformed),"This one-volume commentary is written from the REFORMED point of view. The authors are established scholars who hold completely to the fundamentals of the Christian faith. It is not a devotional commentary, rather, it focuses on understanding what the Bible says and means, leaving it up to the reader to apply this to life today."
5,Was a gift,Was sent in a timely fashion it looks just as the reviewn said it would. My son-in-law will enjoy using it I'm sure.
3,great product but beware,"This is my favorite gum, and it's not available in the Cincinnati area where I live, so I order it online; the last batch which I purchased from Amazon must have gotten too hot in shipping; the flavor has been partially sapped and the color is slightly off in now the second of the 10 tins."
4,Kids keep coming back for more of this one!,"Obvious Letters in a unique & creative approach to an age old preschool dilemma -- learning your ABCs. It draws children in by combining adorable illustrations & word associations (i.e. a b shaped backpack for the letter b). Although Obvious Letters uses some pretty novel words for preschool age kids (yield, razor, handbag), the children I observed reading the book picked them up easily with repeated readings. And that is the best part about Obvious Letters -- kids actually initiate wanting to read it again & again. What higher praise can any children's book receive!"
2,Brilliant and fun illustrtions but...,"I purchased this in the hope to introduce my toddler to the letters and sounds for the first time --- I like the brilliant and fun illustrations but when it came to the vowel sounds, both short and long vowel sounds were introduced and it was a bit confusing for my toddler. Regarding the vowel sounds, I would prefer to adhere to the phonetic approach, introducing the young child short vowel sounds first then long vowel sounds, not when he/she is just starting to learn the letter and their sounds."
1,Long time kindergarten teacher sees problems,"Sorry, this is a great idea, but there are some serious flaws. I like the idea of incorporating a beginning sound picture into the shape of the letter, but as a kindergarten teacher, I see problems.1 - The words are printed in all capitals, which is a big no-no. All words should be printed in lowercase, except for a beginning capital for proper nouns. This would certainly get kids more ready for ""real"" reading.2 - Some of the associative pictures begin with long vowel sounds. All major phonemic awareness, phonics, and reading programs introduce the short vowel sounds first. Long vowel sounds are introduced after short vowels are well established.3 - The coloring pages are not really kid-friendly. The letters are too dark to color in.4 - Some of the associative pictures in obvious letters are not so OBVIOUS (""inside"" for the letter i).This product could be great if these problems were worked out. The concept is great."
4,Haunting and pleasing collection,Dionne Warwick is a genuine classic. Her sound is unique and thesongs are memorable with few exceptions. Heartbreaker is a standoutwith background vocals by the Bee Gees. The Bachrach/David renderingsare haunting and expertly crafted. A great collection in every respect.
3,Study Guide,"There are tons of multiple choice questions with answers, but where's the study material? At least they should have include some reference to textbooks or other reading material that helps the person prepare for the test, than let person to Gage his/her preparedness using the practice test."
5,Slick soundtrack backs up awesome anim. in AE,"Incredible soundtrack to accompany an incredible, groundbreaking movie! Halfway thru the movie I was determined to buy the soundtrack. A nice mix of tracks that fit wonderfully with the movie and stand alone nicely as well. Big names like Lit and the Urge are nice to sell this album, but it sells itself if you've seen the movie.Cosmic Castaway stands out as a great track on this soundtrack, and Lit pumps out another fun and somewhat original, yet easy-to-cover song. Overall, great.I'm seeing the movie again too. Pray for sequel. :-D"
3,Disappointing and misleading...,"The biggest pet peeve that I have with the promotion of motion pictures is the use of music in trailers that either a) never gets used in the movie or b) isn't on the soundtrack. Titan A.E.'s soundtrack can be added to the long list of movies that are guilty of this very thing. If you have been following the production and promotion of this movie, then you probably have seen one, if not both, of its trailers. Both teasers include songs that are not on this album. With that said, the album is still pretty good. However, do not buy it if you were hoping to find the music included in its previews."
4,Great Memories,Seeing this movie as a kid has made me want the movie score for the longest time. Now I finally can and I have all the great songs from the movie. There's a small following of Titan AE. Those of us must have this album
5,CARTOON SOUNDTRACK? Fantastic!,"whoa! Many times, i dont even THINK about even sampling animated movie soundtracks. They usually sux big time! This on the other hand is a big exception. While I was in the theater I knew I wanted to perchase the soundrack. The beats are fantastic. So what if they're different styles... They're still slammin'.Highly reccomended."
3,The promo song's not here!,"On the whole, the soundtrack is a fair one to listen to with good tracks like Bliss' Not Quite Paradise, Lit's Over My Head and The Urge's It's My Turn To Fly. However if you're looking for that song in the promotional trailers, it's not in here. Get it instead from Creed's album. The title of the track is Can you Take Me Higher."
4,Not bad for a soundtrack.,"For those who are complaining that Creed isn't on this soundtrack, watch the movie again and point out to me where it was played. Creed was NEVER PLAYED IN THIS MOVIE. Now everything else was played in this movie. The Urge, Texas, Powerman 5000, etc. Remember that this IS a movie soundtrack, and enjoy it as such. :)"
5,Absolutely mind-blowing!!,"This is the best soundtrack I have ever listened to. I had seen the movie and liked what I heard, but sometimes the songs aren't what they seem when by themselves. But when I played it I was blown away!! The electronics on The End Is Over by Powerman5000 is really entrancing. It's My Turn To Fly has a really good feel overall and the driving feel that you get from the background makes you want to get in your car and drive. Karma Slave by Splashdown is the best out of all the tracks!! The middle-eastern feel gives it some mystery that draws you in like none other. This is one of the best CD's I have heard in a long time and I can't stop playing it!!"
3,Hmmm...Tough Decision,"There is a major pro and con for this soundtrack. The Pro is that the CD does actually have some very good songs on it.(Over My Head,Its My Turn to Fly)and a couple others arent that bad either.(Not Quite Paradise,Holding On,Cosmic Castaway) The con is that the other songs are,at least in my view,not very good and the soundtrack does not really concentrate on a certain type of music.(guess that would be two cons...) If you've seen the movie and like the music on it,go ahead and buy it.But dont buy it if you've only heard one song...its not worth it"
4,"Nice Songs, Could Be Better","Most of the songs are really good, but the combination just simply doesn't go. Rap, Alternative, Techno...does it go together? This CD says a big NO.Songs: Most are good...Length: GoodQuanity: GoodArtists: Could be alot betterBut what about the Creed song, Higher? I like that song! It was in the movie! I'm dissapointed about that, too."
4,Worth its price,"The thing I like the most about this CD is that every time I listen to it, a new song becomes my favorite. But of course, the breakthrough band discovery was Splashdown. Many times I wish there would be more songs influenced by middle-eastern sounds. Not just because we don't listen to them much, but because the sounds and music scale they use over there is absoluetly cool. In this song I especially love the way they've combined the traditional sounds with a western rock-ish beat. Highly recommended!"
5,amazing compilation of music,Hey this is a great CD. If you buy music buy this soundtrack because you will not regret it. if you download music for free... you suck
3,"The soundtrack is better than the movie, but not by much","I actually was one of the people that got consumed by the hype surrounding this movie, I dont know why but I thought that anime was cool... was I wrong, the soundtrack is a little better, I wouldn't put it on my top ten list, but its okay. I am middle of the road on this because its an alternative soundtrack and they have overplayed 2 of the songs on this album already so I dont feel that I need to buy it when I can turn on the radio and hear it. Buy it for your teenager, he/she will love it."
4,new artist,I THINK THE CD IS GOOD AND WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT THE SONG NOT QUITE PARADISE GREAT SONG CANT WAITE TOO HEAR MORE FROM THIS BAND BLISS DO THEY HAVE A CD
3,Not as good as you would think.,"One reviewer earlier said how he was dissapointed that the music in the trailer is not on the CD. I totally agree. You would think that there would be some nice techno beats on this CD, but most of the tracks don't seem to go with the futuristic theme of the movie. Most of the songs are forgetful (especially the new dissapointing one by Powerman 5000), with one or two exceptions. It seems that the songs don't know weather to be rock, metal, or techno. The first song on the CD by Lit, is a good song. Even though it doesn't seem to fit in the movie, it is a good one, especially if you like their other stuff.Overall, I'm not totally dissapointed, but listen to the tracks on this CD before you buy it. And don't only listen to Lit, because that seems to be the only one worth remembering, and it seems to be the CDs only real strong point (even though it doesn't fit the theme)."
1,Should 0!,This CD is just plain BAD. The Lit song is the only good thing on it! I couldn't beleive that they took off 311's Bomb The Town! I'd love the CD if they hadn't done that!
4,Pretty good CD!,"This CD is pretty good, but only buy it if you like MOST of the songs! I bought it, and I only like a couple songs, but I gave it 4 stars because i REALLY like the songs i like! (Personally I like # 1 and 3) Only buy this if you like MOST of the songs! (PLEASE say this helped you!)"
4,Urge makes this soundtrack,"After the first listen to the soundtrack, i was disappointed. However the second time throough, i really enjoyed many of the songs, including tracks by Lit, and especially THE URGE! Wow, these guys know how to rock and i was expecting more of the same, but they somehow incorporated the techno-future theme into their music and made a dynamite song. Look for their new Disc titled Too Much Stereo to be in stores July 18."
5,"You won't want to ""Come Back Down to Earth""","This CD is a great mix to turn up and sing along with. People who haven't seen the movie like many of the songs. Songs from the movie. Now the deal with CREED's song confusion is simple - their song was NOT in the movie, but was used on some of the TV trailers for the movie. I remember wondering at the theater why I didn't hear CREED the whole time when it had been used for the commercials. Anyway, the soundtrack is excellent, and so was the movie. In my opinion, it's one of the best ""older kids/adult"" soundtracks for an animated film."
3,Its good,"ITs a good disc, yo will like it if you like the movie.But its a good one to hear, but not to repeat to many times."
4,Really Good Soundtrack,"Really, I have 2 favorite songs on the album. The first being ""Karma Slave"" and the other being ""Like Lovers (Holding On)."" Like all the others said, ""Cosmic Castaway was also very good and it really does fit in with the movie perfectly. Basically I like every single song (which is unusual for me) except for Jamiroquai's song. I didn't like it very much. Over all, this soundtrack is great and everyone who liked the movie and likes alternative music should buy it!"
4,Not a new world creator ~ Just a nice bundle of pop music,"Lit's ""Over my head"" is a bad introduction to the CD. The CD sounds very ""European"" and isn't like the ""Mission Impossible 2"" soundtrack in the type of music. But besides that, this is a great collection of music. If you loved the movie and bought the DVD, then you might want to get this CD if you have some of your income to dispose off in a CD. It spans from rock to reggae to rap and dance but there isn't anything here that anyone will be talking about even next year. Just a soundtrack with present popular music - though not quite American alternative/rock music."
4,Good quality,Nice heavyweight fabric and beautiful embroidery. A bit frayed in a few places but overall I'm satified with the purchase.
3,Cute but squeaker broke FAST!,The dogs loved it right away but within 20-30 seconds they had already broken the squeaker. So although it still looks cute and has a pleasant smell they really don't pay much attention to it unless I am playing with it and running with it.
5,Tough Enough For My Pitbull!!!,"My American Pitbull Terrier LOVES this toy! It is vanilla scented, squeaks, very durable, easy for me to see when we play at night and it floats too! I can't take my dog for a hike without it. If you have a molossar-type dog, this is a great toy for them!!!"
5,"A Great Book To Read Anywhere, Anytime!!!","Coahoma Street is a wonderful book that captures the mind from the first page to the last. I can only hope on another novel by this author as his style is unique and very descriptive. It feels as if the story is going on around you. Please read this book if you haven't, you wont be sorry! I already know what my entire family is getting for Christmas this year.... their own copies of Coahoma Street!!"
4,It's easy buy this,"I recently stumbled across this re-release and was happy to finally hear ""This is Easy"" and the 9 others ""Mary Jean"" being one of the unheard. It was a blast of pop bliss. Fat guitar licks, catchy beats, heartfelt melody. I am so happy this is avalible again."
3,B & C Staples,I recieved the staples a day before the staple gun arrived. As always they were in a Amazon box. Whoever selected the box for these needs a lesson in packaging. I opened the Amazon box to find a smaller box from B & C which was busted open. There were nearly 3000 staples scattered around in the Amazon box. Maybe I should have returned it but I had a project to do. I did contact Amazon but got no response. The staples are fine but their packaging leaves a lot to be desired.
3,Shipping was a joke...,I ordered these staples and received them in a box much larger than needed with no packing which led to staples being all broken up. Also there was something in the box that I didnt even order. Im very dissappointed and I returned them as I dont have all day to load my staple gun 6 or 8 staples at a time :( The quality of the staples seemed fine but the shipping was a joke....
3,"Good Product, poor packaging/shipping!!!!!!!!!!!","Just received two boxes of these staples. The staples work fine and I have had no problems with them. However, when these were shipped to me, they were just packaged loosely in a large box enabling them to be thrown around in the box during shipment. This resulted in the strips of staples to be broken up into much shorter ""strips""/pieces which makes loading them into the gun sort of a pain."
4,Good looking than the white & black dials,Good looking than the white & black dials. I have seen all the dials in hand & the blue one is the best.
2,If it sounds too good to be true....,"Bought this watch for my husband, one year and two weeks ago. The 10 year battery died 10 days ago. No special use. No underwater use, just normal wear and tear. I bought this watch thinking it would not need a battery change as often..and replaced his old watch that got about 2 years per battery..and this one got one year and four days. Wouldn't recommend it because that is a very misleading statement about this watch!"
1,received 2 defective watches,"both first watch and replacement leaked - never submerged below one meter - supposedly ""water resistant to 50 meters"""
3,Great Buy For Less Than $25,"I bought the watch as I wanted an inexpensive casual watch with a metal band. I liked the picture of the watch so I ordered it.I like it.I also bought another casio watch with this one that has the same guts.As with the other one, the crystal does scratch easily so don't go banging this thing against walls. Also, the backlight doesn't do much good.But... all in all, I like this lightweight watch.I rate it only with 3 stars but don't let that discourage you. It's a good time piece."
4,Excellent watch Great value,"I was looking for an inexpensive yet good looking watch. This watch perfectly fit my needs. The metal band and the color create a much more expensive appearance. The watch is not heavy but not light weight either, giving a quality feel. Setting the analog arms is not as straightforward as I like but I can live with it."
4,Affordable for an active man,"Can`t afford an expensive watch , especially when they take a beating every day. Had to get a kid to set it ....,but that`s how it goes these days...."
4,Excellent given its price,"I had only 2 watches over the last 20+ years and they were Casio G-Shock. I misplaced 1 and damaged the other when I tried replacing the battery by myself and the trapped moisture screwed up the LED. Bought this as a replacement as the picture looked good and it is dirt cheap. When I received it, its dial is definitely smaller than my previous G-Shock and it won't be mistaken as an expensive watch but it still looks better than most in its price range. The digital time and the analog time have to be set separately which i find a little annoying but i supposed others might have a use for 2 different timing. The memo and alarm functions are probably redundant since it's easier to use the equivalent functions on your phone. Nonetheless it should suffice for my daily rugged usage."
4,Good value,"I bought this watch about a year ago and it has been a good value:10 year batteryMetal bandBacklightAlarm50 meter waterproofEasy to read illuminated handsDual Analog and digital timeDigital date and dayLocking metal band claspPrice makes it a stealNegatives:Crystal scratches easilyFace is small (i'm a big guy so the face is little small)Changing the settings are difficult to remember (I always have to refer to the manual)That's it.I did get my watch with a black face and like it. Pretty straightforward styling.Well worth the money as a vacation/outdoor 2nd watch when you do not want to wear a nicer one, or for a teenager/kid as a first watch."
2,"Unreliable, poorly designed","I bought this watch while in Australia 18 months ago. The analog watch is not precise. The analog, digital and digital world time clocks have to all be set independently, and it's not easy to do. After about 9 months the watch ""hicupped"" and all settings were lost, but after resetting it worked fine until last week, when the digital display disappeared and the analog clock stopped. But it wasn't due to the battery dying (it's supposed to last 10 years), because the light on the display stayed lit for several days before it finally died. There must be some internal electronic problem; nothing I did should have caused it to ""freak out"" twice like it did. I won't be buying Casio again."
4,Sweet,"The only thing I would change...and there may be a great tech reason why it can't...would be to simplify or speed up the procedure for setting the ""analog"" (hands) setting.Other than that, nice, attractive watch."
2,"Difficult to set, Dial light is no good","Did not like the watch, ended up exchanging it, dial is to small, dial light is not nearly bright enough, setting instructions are difficult to understand and follow, and print in instruction manual small and hard to read. Can't really recommend this product, sorry!"
5,wrist watch,"I recently purchased a Casio Men's model AW80D-2AV watch. It keeps time perfectly. The watch looks like it cost much, much more than it did. I am extremely happy with my Casio watch. You can not go wrong with a Casio watch! I know. It is my second one."
4,Very nice,"very nice watch i would say blueish -purple more then blue but thats my opinion, i did have to take it to a jewler to get the wrist band adjusted a bit biger i have larger wrists and hands so it was tight to the point of cutting off circulation even at its bigest setting but its a nice watch works well, having it adjusted to fit was a minor point."
5,good,"it is good watch i m happy with it i take showerand its water proof i work unloading trucks with watch on ,and it still working good . thankyou so much"
3,Good choice for this price range,"Good one.All the features specified are good enough to make it a good watch.Should consider this , if thinking of this price range."
4,Good value for the money,"This is the second watch of this ""series"" from Casio that I have purchased. They work as advertised but have poor backlights compared to the 'Indiglo' backlights on Timex watches. Otherwise they seem to be quite sturdy and have more than enough features to be a good value for the money spent."
4,Nice Watch,I enjoyed spending a few extra moments figuring out this watch seeing it was somewhat of a challenge with electronic buttons but I really do like it.
5,"Nice looking, very practical watch.",Purchased to replace an atomic watch. The leather band wore out on the old watch and the shape of the watch didn't fit any replacement bands.This new watch has a rugged metal band that should last quite awhile. The clasp is easy to unsnap with side pushbuttons. The styling is very nice too.I'm using it to show the local west coast time with analog display and east coast time on the digital display when I travel to Maine. It's a great general purpose watch with all the features you'd expect with an analog/digital watch. The price makes this a super deal.
2,Give this one a pass,"Definitely wouldn't buy another.Pros: Inexpensive. Good, strong band (I had to Google how to take a link out of it, but that's a minor thing). Very visible in the daylight.Cons: I am disappointed with the dial. The light is inadequate for night-time reading of the digital display. Also, when time time is between about :25-:35 (any hour) then the minute-hand hangs in front of the digital display. I accidentally dropped it and it landed on a hinge where the band connected and broke off the piece (I glued it back with super-glue)... they cheaped-out with the design. One year later it is useless with a useless strap.Bottom line: Although I use it constantly and, for the price, I am satisfied nevertheless I recommend giving this one a pass. Spend a little more money."
4,Highly recommended,Very nice watch according to price. The resin parts are a little less darker than indicated in pictures. Very recommendable anyway.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH!!,"Watch looks nice but the wrist band provided is too small for an average size wrist. There is no outward adjustment - the watch was sent fully expanded and after one day of wear I had an enormous blister on my wrist (bigger than a quarter) and about 1/8"" thick filled with fluid. Called Casio to ask about getting more links - was rudely told they are not available. Can't find a watch band locally that will fit. Bottom line I have thrown away my money on this watch. My last Casio lasted about 10 years and still fits but is pretty banged up and that's why I replaced it with another Casio. Will NOT buy another Casio and will continue to inform people that they are now too cheap to provide a watch band with adequate adjustment."
5,great too,"blue dial an intense palette; heft, band, performance (mind-boggling accuracy) looks overall add up to a fantastic product, 10 yr. battery an awesome claim, (check with me around 2015), had the black one for a few months until a friend accidentally junked it, repeat buy says a lot. plus what the other guy said, merchant deserves props"
4,"Looks good, good price",It's an attractive watch with a good metal band that's not difficult to adjust. The only downside is that adjusting the analog time display is cumbersome.
1,Stopped working in a year,"It has some interesting functions like Phone Book and stop watch, however, most of those functions are now can be replace by cell phone...In addition, even though it claimed 10 year battery life, mine stopped working within a year. For the price of this watch is not even worth the money to replace the battery. I went ahead bought a Seiko instead."
2,Item is not brand new.,I found a scratch about 1mm long on the surface of my watch.Also I find lots of scratches on the back of the watch.
4,Nearly Indestructible,"I'm writing this review, because after six years of daily use this watch has finally bit the dust. The watch is sturdy, robust, and stands up to wear and abuse quite well. I used this watch as a daily watch, but also took it with me for regular frisbee and other sports; the end result being that this watch has been thrown on concrete, kicked, and abused no end. The watch has begun to show it's age, the base material is entirely plastic (simply painted with a metallic finish), this will rub off after many years revealing the beige plastic base beneath. The Band is prone to scuffing and minor scratches, but otherwise stands up to damage.My only real complaint with this watch is how slow adjusting the analog portion of the clock is. It must be adjusted separately from the digital portion, and can only be run forward to adjust it. Not exactly the ideal. All in all, I'm happy with it, and the replacement I ordered is the same watch in different colors."
2,band is cheaply made,"There are a number of excellent Casio models available, and the operational function of this model may be excellent as well, BUT the band is cheaply made, lacks the flexibility of typical metal Casio bands, and is too small to fit my wrist. The watch may work well, but I'll not know since it doesn't work for me to wear it."
3,"""10-year"" battery dead after 9 months","This is a nice watch, if a bit complicaed to learn. Don't travel without the instruction manual until you can do time zone shifts from memory.I have downrated it because the battery gave out after 10 months."
4,GOOD WATCH POOR BAND,I like the watch and this is purchase was a replacement for the same watch I had previously.The data bank is very useful to store key info.The combination of a digital and a conventional watch is very useful for international travel.Unfortunately the bank of this new watch was much more rigid than the previous one. It was uncomfortable for me and I had to replace it.The price is excellent for this useful watch!
1,Tastes like Paint,This mass gainer is the most foul disgusting thing i have ever tasted. I tried lowering the dose more and more to not get the taste but this stuff literally tastes like paint. No exaggeration whatsoever this stuff is awful beyond comprehension. DO NOT BUY!
2,this tastes nasty,i have used this product because i wanted to gain at least 20 pounds but this product taste is so aweful and disgusting and doesn't do a single thing to help you gain weight. i would not recommend this product to anyone who wants to gain fast weight. this product is a total waste of money . spend your money worthwhile.
2,not for bamboo,"I purchased these staples for use on 9/16"" strand-oriented bamboo flooring. The staples were practically useless for this application. The bamboo is too hard - the staples are not made with hard enough steel. 7 or 8 out of 10 staples would not cleanly penetrate the flooring into the subfloor - they just bent into a wadded up mess. The next day I tried Senco staples - the same size - and they worked just fine. This brand may be a good economical product for softer woods, but WILL NOT work for something as hard as bamboo."
2,What a major disappointment ! ! !,Look elsewhere if you're searching for high quality fusion/progressive (go for any Niacin CD or Uncle Moe's Space Ranch with Garsed/Helmerich/Willis/Kinsey/Chambers for example). The music on this CD lacks badly of good ideas and it feels way to composed and structured overall. I really had high hopes on this one...... :(
2,Not Original Recordings!,"If you want the originals buy the Capitol records Version. This is one of those disc's where the artist had to re-record the songs on his own label to avoid legal action. Very mis-leading. Johnny Rivers is a great artist with classic songs, but he must have got a raw deal on his song rights. Maybe we'll see his story on 'Behind The Music' some day."
2,Songs aren't the Originals,"You won't recognize some of the songs as they're not the originals. In fact it doesn't even sound like Johnny's regular back up musicians. Most are live and he's changed them in an interesting way, but it simply doesn't measure up. Note that the cover of this album is the same as another one that does have the originals, and I find that misleading."
2,Don't waste your money on this one!!!,"Pass this one by... it may have the songs, but not the quality... done in a live and Re-mixed format it is a DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!"
2,"Good songs, but disappointed they weren't the originals","I bought this CD hoping to hear Johnny's great performances of ""Mountain of Love"", ""Summer Rain"", ""Swayin' To the Music (Slow Dancin')"", etc. Unfortunately, all but the latter sound like new recordings of the old hits. The re-recordings are not all bad, but I would have hoped to have had all of the originals."
2,Close but no cigar,"This is a ""live"" cd, it is done very well, but it isn't studio quality. I was specifically looking for the song, ""Summer Rain"". Basically the cd suffices but I wish it were the ""real deal"" the songs I remember from ol' radio days"
2,Needs much more information on tuning,"I'm a big fan of Des Hammill having bought 6 of his other books so I was a bit suprised to find this only deals with using standard parts, apart from briefly mentioning Holley carbs there is no mention or suggestion of using performance parts and their likely effects on output.A nice history of the engine but other than telling you to use the best of the standard parts which I would have thought was obvious anyway there is a real lack of information on upgrades. Doesn't even mention the GT40 crate engine or the ally heads which I would think lots of people will be starting with as a baseConsidering the title of the book and the picture on the cover I would imagine lots of people would buy it as I did for info on tuning and upgrades.You will be disappointed I'm afraid it doesn't talk about them at all!If anybody knows a good performance tuning manual for the 302 please let me know!"
2,Movie/Comic Book was Better,"This game was OK. You have to be a fan of the game to really get into it since the controls are rudimentary. Otherwise, it isn't really different from an *80's* grinding game--you know the kind: one or two buttons for attack, maybe one button for defense. A 2D scroll version probably would have been funner; but who would buy that? If you are a fan, don't buy it. If you aren't a fan, definitely don't buy it."
3,"It can entertain you on long rides in the car or whatever, but not very fun.","Its kinda like a bad version of god of war. A really bad version. It is kind of interesting, but overall just sucks. The graphics are extremely terrible, even for PSP. I didn't have the patience to beat it so I don't know how it ends, but I just had almost no fun playing it."
3,alright,the game its self is in ok condidtion It has minor scrathches on it but it works they don't come with a case or book
4,Still Love This Album,"I like this album a lot. Though Julie is known for her comedic talents and the singles from this album were comedy songs, I have found over the years that my favorites have become the non-comedic ones. My favorites are Callin' Your Heart, Time Slips Away and Shut Up & Kiss Me. I still listen to them regularly."
3,Only comedic effect.,"If you're excited about music, don't bother. If you're in need of a comedy injection, continue....Julie Brown cracks me up. This LP is well worth the cash. You'll dance, and you'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll burp.HELP ME!!!I'm trapped, in the body of a lesbian....Love to all!"
4,for the price of a magazine...,"For the price of a magazine that will be thrown away a month later, you can get this basic but good little atlas that will prove useful for years to come. It's lightweight and paperback and printed on matte paper, and is the size of magazine. Although it's no replacement for a 'real' atlas, the level of detail is surprisingly decent...better than the dumbed-down school atlases I had in elementary school. Each map has the legend on the page. It has an index as well as a bit of additional information about each country.Downsides: The countries are shaded in somewhat dark colors, making the text a bit hard to read. The page margins are very large...they could've made the maps larger without such large white borders. There are no continuation arrows on the edge of the maps to show what page to find the next map in that direction.Even if you're not a student, or into geography or travel, this could be the most useful $5 you'll ever spend."
4,Competent and Concise,"This is a very thin volume for tugging along to class in your 3-ring binder. I was disappointed but then again it is fairly thin. Don't expect more, considering the price, than a quick boost of background knowledge. Still, this will be a big help and is trustworthy. A real find for your budding Jr High/Sr High-schooler. Good for an at-school homework/classwork assist."
4,Great!,"This item was in excellent shape for my daughter to use in school. You couldn't even tell it had been used before. It did take a little longer to arrive than all the other items I purchased the same day, but the quality of the product outweighed that."
5,Very Nice,"A good collection of Ska with a female front person. ""Skypager"" by the Shanksters is exceptional. The Usuals have a excellent track as well. If you like Ska you'll hear some hard to find to impossible to find stuff. Including some tracks for those of us that give rein on occation to the Goddess. Sample ""Don't Step On My Fingers"" by the The Solicitors."
5,From One Who Was There,"Actually, I wasn't there, my wife was, so when she gets a chance, I'll have her write a review. She's told me so much about this concert, she'll be thrilled to know I'm ordering it for her. She said it was simply the best concert she's been to in her life. So if the reviewers are right that the recording quality and live environment on this album are superior, then this will be a hell of an album. And my wife was well aware at the time that Nancy was dying."
5,Nancy Lamott at the Tavern on the Green,"The year Nancy Lamott was to present her program to an audience here in Duncan,Oklahoma, we were saddened she was unable to attend because of her illness with cancer. This recording really shows her personality and super voice. Hearing this recording made me feel I was a part of that audience. What a talent! What a vocalist! Had she lived she would be at the top of her profession!Dwayne Brittain405 E. Chestnut Ave.Duncan, Oklahoma"
4,Very Good Music,"This band is great. There music, simply putting it, ROCKS! This C.D. is good quality hard rock. They also don't hide there Christianity in their songs."
2,Arcade Style Game,"There is nothing defective about the product itself, but it's not like the first two games in the SpyFox series. It is set up in miniature shorter games like an arcade. It has nothing much to do with detective work like the others, so it's not useful for long term entertainment."
2,Some major drawbacks,"I couldn't get the figure to raise its arms high enough to be put on a cross. Also, not anatomically correct. :("
4,gag gift gone bad,at first bought this as a gag gift for a religious farther in law- well it back fired- jesus action figure knows his scripture he played show and tell and brought it to church. he left it here at my house so my 3 yr old can play with it.lol
5,Great Toy,I have this sitting on my desk with Dagger and UZI and people cant stop playing with it. They push the talk button all the time and are amused at all the lines that come out of the figure.
3,Bad if your actually looking for it to speak,"The doll itself is nice. But it did no talking. I pressed the button several times, I took out the batteries only to find they must have been really old because they were all karoded with white and green hard scale. I kept the doll for display, was very disapointed it did not speak as it should."
1,My 'graven image' of Jesus says the craziest things..,"My Talking Jesus Christ Action Figure told me to murder my family!Plus I think it sucks that this Jesus Christ is NOT depicted accurately to the description given in the well known science-fiction classic ""The Bible""! He's supposed to be a Black Dwarf!!So this particular blasphemous ""graven image"" of Jesus Christ must be one of those cheap generic knock-off figures, like you'd find being sold in dollar-stores or the streets of Manhattan!And what kind of ACTION figure doesn't even come with accessories such as machine guns or even a samurai sword!?"
3,Why is it only $49.99 at Toys R Us?,I am looking into purchasing this work bench for my daughter. I found this same toy at Toys R Us for only $49.00 however all of these are over $100. Am I missing something? Do these have something the Toys R Us doesn't?
3,Not a bad toy!,I was disappointed that the clock on the bench did not work! But overall the toy is alright my 2 year old loves to play with the tools! Although to be a Home Depot it is not very durable! Made out of plastic and wabbly!
5,Son's favorite Christmas Gift,"Our 21 month old son received many gifts for Christmas (in excess of $500 total) that I thought would steal the show, but this work bench came in first. In fact, he used the tools (such as the hammer and drill) to ""fix"" his other new toys. He especially loves moving the big screws from one hole to another on the bench. The design is brilliant. Although the toy came with no assemply instructions (it may have just been our box), I didn't have too hard of a time putting it together. My advice is to assemble the toy before giving it to a toddler! All batteries were not included so have plenty of AA's on hand for the power tools"
3,"Sorry, but it's a piece of junk!","I'm sorry to say, but this toy is a piece of junk. After less than a year, all but one of the battery-operated toys is not working. Can't say why, but do know that our other Home Depot battery-operated toys, chainsaw and weed-eater, have done the same thing - stoped working. My boys did love these toys when they worked, but we're getting much more use out of the screwdrivers and wrenches now."
2,It doesn't make sense,"I thought this toy would be great, but I was really suprised by how flimsy the whole structure was."
3,Clock doesn't work and the bench is flimsy,"The power tools are great. We bought this for our 3-year old son and he loves it. As parents, both my husband and I felt ripped off because of the quality of the bench - it is flimsy and cheap. However, the tools are really cool and nice. The clock doesn't work because the battery storage is missing the battery circuit connectors - poor caftsmanship! But, overall, our son loves it. If the power tools weren't so nice, I would give this a one-star rating."
2,"Initially great, than nubs started breaking","Due to Achilles tendon surgery, I was walking funny and landing on my heel alot. This caused some plantar fasciatis symptoms. These sandals were great for the first 3 weeks or so. Initially, I could only wear them for a few minutes before I had to put on socks since my feet weren't used to them. It did feel therapeutic, though. After it awhile, it felt very comfortable. Less therapeutic value. However, after about 4 weeks, the rubber bits started falling off. I did exercise in the house in them, so I could have been gentler, but still I was not happy about them breaking so fast. Your mileage may vary if you are gentler..."
4,"Good nails, but pricey","The nails shot flawlessly out of my Porter Cable framer. The paper clip was rigid enough to keep nails from breaking off which tends to mean less wasted nails since most times the few broken off nails usually end up tossed on the floor. I wish the case had a 1500 to 2000 count quantity. Consider comparing these nails against Maze nails when making a decision. I bought Maze nails, too, but they were double hot dipped galvanized, not stainless. The cost of these nails amounted to about 10 cents per nail."
1,Skate speedometer only...no Silva wheel.,"I ordered this product from Amazon...received it without the wheel which was supposed to be included...called customer service, they gave me a prepaid label to return it and sent a replacement. Still no wheel. I called Tech40 who said they had discontinued this item over a year ago and are totally unable to help. No matter what the listing says, the wheel is NOT included and the speedometer is totally useless without it. We have spent two days online and on the phone with various sporting goods places...there are no Silva wheels to be found."
5,Great Bargain,"So far so good, the computer runs very well. I was able to hook up the Ethernet connection without any problems, and I was surfing the net in no time. It is free from any unnecessary software, which is nice, because it doesn't hog the hard drive. As stated in the description, it really was ready for use right out of the box. Speaking of boxes, it was packed very well, and it shipped and arrived really fast. The computer looks brand new, no scratches or blemishes. The keyboard and mouse work really well also. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase, and I am glad I found this computer. Great bargain, I definitely recommend buying this computer, if you are looking for an inexpensive user friendly computer for your home."
3,"Really nice, but doesn't last.","This costume was more comfortable than I was expecting, and looked really good! The problem is, after wearing it all day, it got a run on the butt which quickly turned into a huge hole. A costume should last longer than a pair of cheap pantyhose. It would have been perfect if it had lasted."
2,Great Costume!,"I bought this uniform last October for Halloween. It fit perfectly except for the bum area. Of course I am known for my big bum, so it was not really a surprise. It was a pain to go to the bathroom in, but all jumpsuits are. Everyone liked it very much, I got lots of compliments and aproving looks. I have meant to sew the bum seam up again, but I haven't got the time yet. The seam came out about an inch-and-a-half. Not much. I think I will cut some excess fabric from somewhere else and put another piece in. I like my uniform very much and I don't regret buying it at all. A very nice uniform, IMO. (In My Opinion) Well, that's my opinion. Hope it was helpful! I didn't rate this item because something is wrong with my computer and I can't rate things. I would rate it 5/5 stars, points, or whatever."
4,Great starter,Just like other Dummies books I have seen this is loaded with a lot of good information. I think this book is a great starter/supplement to learning Italian.
2,Not so good,I think Italian for dummies is more of a course for tourists rather than someone who wants to learn it. It lacks Grammatical explanations. I was dissatisfied.
2,too many mistakes,"The beginning of this book is fraught with mistakes (in Italian; in English; in printing; etc.). You don't have to be fluent in Italian to notice them. All you have to do is be vigilant. After a few chapters, things start to ""settle down"" a bit. The mistakes are less frequent and (probably also) you've learned to overlook those that still ""made it through"". I don't blame the writers. The book seems to be very well-organized. I blame the editors for not spotting the mistakes. It's their job, right? I also blame the publishers for trusting the editors. Maybe the title should have been ""Italian by Dummies""(?)."
3,Italian for Dummies,I've taken a lot of self-study foreign language courses this one is not the best. This is because they offer little in the way of structure so that it would be possible for you to construct a sentence on your own. Instead they have focused on offering you complete sentences to memorize for a number of situations.
4,Italian for Dummies,"I wanted to try learning Italian for the fun of it and have found this book extremely helpful. The format and substance are light, entertaining, and concentrated. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning the Italian language at their own speed."
4,"You'll learn some Italian,but, you won't be fluent","You will learn specific words and phrases that you can use,but as far as holding a complete conversation in Italian that might be a little hard.The CD is clear and easy to understand. All in all I would say to give this a try. At least you wiil be able to get by with putting your basic thoughts accross !!"
3,Same voice on all 3 discs,"This is an informative 3 disc set, but it's the same male, dole drum,, voice on every disc. No other voices, no female etc.After a while you want to fall asleep. It sounds like a tired old man."
2,Just a peek,"This book and CD is a bird's eye view introduction to Italian. If you a serious about learning the language, choose a product with lots more audio content. Unless you hear the spoken language you'll never grasp it.On the other hand, if a quick look is what you're looking for, then this is the book for you."
2,Not for dummies!,"Learning a language is difficult, at least for me, and I was disappointed with this book. Yes, it does provide a lot of information, but it is not presented in a way that makes learning the language any easier, fun or engaging. And, since I enjoy learning Italian, I've tried several types of programs. I use this book more as a reference tool. Can't imagine ever learning the language from scratch with it! Clearly not for dummies."
5,Fantastico!,"This is a really easy book to use. believe it or not, Italian is my first language, English my second & I speak several others as well! I used this book as a refresher course & I was totally amazed at the ease of use & the ability to understand everything that was put before me! I highly recommend this book to absolutely anyone that wants to learn basic Italian!"
5,Great Way to Learn Some Italian,"I have bought several Italian language products from books to CD's and this little book is by far the best of all! Very easy to comprehend and learn at your pace. Well organized, with emphasis on most important aspects of the language pointed out very clearly. I love this book for learning Italian for my travel.Susan Dugas,Orlando, FL"
2,Italian for Dummies,"I expected a brief overview, but there are a lot of holes: the pronunciation is reviewed, and then later on you find extreme differences to these rules with no explanation. The same with personal pronouns, etc.It's better than nothing, but I may end up buying another book in the end."
4,Italian,"Italian for Dummies (With Audio CD)Great condition, the product arrived earlier than expected and in better condition than I expected. It actually matched the product description, so I'm pleased with that. I will purchase from them again."
1,NO CD-ROM W/THIS BOOK!!,"I purchased this book as it supposedly came with a CD-ROM - it does not!! It comes with a regular audio CD. The error in the product title is on AMAZON'S part, as Amazon clearly describes it as containing a ""CD-ROM."" I didn't notice until I received it that the book cover states ""audio CD"". As for book content, no comment yet, as I'm trying to decide whether the book is staying or going."
5,What a wonderful start,"From quite literally the first line of The Sleeping Dragon, I knew I was on to something special. It's hard for me to say how much I've enjoyed these books, and I can't count how many times I've reread them and enjoyed them again, and to have the first three, altogether, in a high-quality hardcover is like seeing an old friend, all dressed up."
4,Lutron Diva LED dimmer,"This switch is pricy but works great. Has good instructions and is easy to install. I gave it 4 stars because it wasn't the exact switch I wanted (I know that may not be a fair assessment). The switch itself works great, I would just prefer to have a regular toggle switch to match everything else in my house . . . . apparently, no one makes a toggle dimmer for LEDs yet. I was also surprised in that the switch is illuminated when off for ease of locating in the dark."
1,coleman french press,The screen on the Coleman french press does not fit causing grounds to seep through.
4,almost perfect,"After our latest glass Bodum press was destroyed by a falling coffee mug, I looked online and found this one. It is the exact same size as the 8 cup Bodum press. Like some other reviewers said, the filter on the plunger isn't a perfect fit, but the one from the broken Bodum was so I just swapped them out. Overall I think it works very well, and won't break when dropped like the Bodum presses. The way the handle is set up to either hold on the lid on it's lowermost settings or allow the lid to be removed on an upper setting is not the most ideal because it's a lot of effort to remove the handle from it's setting, but overall I like this press and it is definitely worth the money."
5,Features whimsy and laughs aplenty,"King Of Diamonds by Don Strachan is a loopy, humorous and fun-filled science fiction fable about an All-Star baseball team the Megaglopoulis Mutants, whose members feature a would-be Frisbionic woman, a chorus of frogs, a supernatural mystic on a skateboard, the World's Greatest Ex-Salientologist and more. Threaded with adult humor including a one-of-a-kind sex primer, King Of Diamonds features whimsy and laughs aplenty and is a lighthearted and fantastic adventure for science fiction enthusiasts interested in becoming acquainted with something a little different."
3,"Broken box, staples everywhere - still they work!","A simple product, well made, well engineered - shipped miserably. When the row is broken up, you end up loading 1/2 rows. Still, they worked fine. I do wish they would just securely tape the box - all sides, even the bottom, then UPS cannot break into a brick. Placing it in a larger box with popped plastic bags was silly."
5,Gary Morris,This is a wonderful CD. Great Artist--Gary Morris--nobody can sing Wind Beneath My Wings like he can.
5,Always a Winner!!,"Have loved this guy's music since the early 80s, some real tear-jerkers on this album but definitely worth listening to!!!"
2,OK but missing some major items.,"I bought this book thinking it was really an A to Z of the most important Italians, but it is missing some major aspects of Italian history in many subjects of science and art. An OK book for the money."
1,Music for crazy people.,"Have you people lost your minds? This is music you put on when you have dinner guests who've stayed too long and you want them to leave. I mean, do we really need to hear ""Baby, Baby"" one more time? I used to respect Amy Grant when her music reflected what she believed as a christian. Now I guess its all about making a buck and keeping your name out there so the public doesn't completely forget about you."
2,industry favorites,"a more apt title would have been ""industry favorites""this is the record of how a wonderful young woman became owned by the nashville recording industry and how artistry can slip from music.i love amy grant. i grew up listening to amy, christmas would not be christmas without amy, however, i miss the real her.we all know it is there, and the cover photo almost recaptures her.i hope she can come back around and leave the plastic image behind that the industry has made her into."
2,Can't Believe How Bad This Is (But She Sure Is Cute),"Didn't know much about Amy but was hoping this would be a solid collection (considering it is her best). Wow if this is her best, the rest must be total garbage! All in all this is really mediocre stuff - The Water starts things off on a good note but after that - really bad! Her voice is ok but the songs are soooooooooo bad. This is just bad songwriting! Taylor Swift songs sound realy really good next to this trash. (Although Amy has a much better voice than Taylor!) ""The Next Time I Fall"" is a horrible song!!! ""Baby Baby"" is ok I guess, ""Every Heartbeat"" is a bad remake of ""Baby Baby"" and is a horrible song, ""That's What Love Is For"" is ok I guess...???? The rest just really stinks! Avoid at all costs!!"
5,Welcome Back Amy............,"I had almost forgot about Amy Grant with all the constant new music coming out. I heard over the radio she was coming out with a greatest hits cd, and all the memories started flooding back. I remembered liking alot of the songs she released in the 90's so I just had to snatch this cd up. I bought it for a couple songs but I ended up liking alot of the other tracks more. My favourite track is ""Like I Love U"". I don't know when this song came out originally, but it is now one of my faves for life. I also like ""The Water"". Amy is an awesome, soulful singer and I am so glad she released this cd. She outdid herself. I hope she gets more recognition. Thanks Amy, for all the awesome songs!!"
4,GREATEST HITS doesn't mean all her hits...,"When this CD was released in the fall of 2004, I was impressed by the balance of songs from the late 80s and the 90s. But there are still some tracks that did and didn't belong. Here's my list:Songs that didn't need to be included: ""I Will Remember You,"" ""The Things We Do For Love,"" ""Baby Baby (7"" Heart In Motion Mix)""Songs that should've been included: ""1974"" (from LEAD ME ON), ""Ask Me"" (from HEART IN MOTION), and ""It Is Well With My Soul/The River's Gonna Keep On Rolling"" (from LEGACY...HYMNS & FAITH)."
2,catchy&run of the mill,Amy Grant was one of those Artists that had a couple of catchy cuts here&there but in the big picture She never could hold me for a whole Album or anything really much Beyond a EP.this set showcases Her Hits.She has a Charm&Carefree vibe that works well against Her Shortcomings.not bad at all.
2,Amy - come back to your fan base,"Listening to this album at Christmas was somewhat disappointing. Granted, the songs on this album are some of the most well known to the general public and wonderful songs, but there are songs missing on this album that are classics.In particular I missed ""El Shaddai"" and ""Thy Word"". Amy has always been a great example to young Christian girls everywhere. Yet not putting in ""Thy Word"" and putting in ""Yellow Taxi"" is not exactly an inspiration to young ladies.My nieces have already switched to Point of Grace and Girls of Grace.Amy, please come back."
5,Eclectic Breakthrough-We Love You Like A Rock,"This was one of the important albums of the early 70s with infusions of gospel, folk, and Dixieland. The songs are some of the most witty of his entire career. This does not get as much attention now because of his other good albums but I remember when the FM was playing every cut off of this album as if there were ten hit singles off of this. This is so good that there should have been ten hit singles!"
2,Not the original version.,"Unfortunately this is not the original version of this, had I known this I would not have purchased it, apart from that everything was to my satisfication."
2,"a low, but still better than most pop records","This is probably Paul Simon's second worst record (after the dismal ""Songs from the Capeman"", and not counting the first three Simon and Garfunkel records). The epithet ""one man's ceiling is another man's floor"" is mildly amusing--I suppose--, but repeated it quickly becomes annoying, and it certainly can't support an entire lyric: Simon should know better. Musically ""Kodachrome"" and ""An American Tune"" are pastiches, strings of cliches; lyrically they are drab. The best one can say about ""Was a Sunny Day"" and ""Take Me to the Mardi Gras"" is that they are filler. On the other hand, ""Love Me Like a Rock"" is clever; ""Tenderness"" is apposite (and opposite Billy Joel's insipid ""Honesty""); ""Something So Right"" is pleasant.Just make sure your collection includes ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"", ""Paul Simon"", Still Crazy After All These Years"", and ""Graceland"" first."
5,A bigger hit than the debut!,"Paul Simon scored more hits with this album than his 1972 solo debut. There are four Top 20 hits which are KODACHROME,a trademark for Kodak's color film,ST. JUDY COMET,LOVES ME LIKE A ROCK and SOMETHING SO RIGHT. All songs appeared on NEGOTIATIONS AND LOVE SONGS 1971-1986,released in 1988. The other songs are good. On the cover is a photo of a teenage Paul Simon,circa 1950's."
4,why?,"to tell you the truth i don't have this cd but i have all the goo goo dolls cd's and all i have to say is why? why ""Iris"" isn't there. where is it? it's the best song of the goo goo dollswhy?"
1,Garbage - A Poor Representaion of G.G.D's,"I gave this 1 star because it is really a cd with only 2 good songs. Those being the last 2. If you read my other goo reviews you'd know how I feel about the dir4ection they went starting with 'hold me up' and getting progressively worse with each new one. So it is obvious I dislike the fact that this compilation only contains 2 tracks from their first 2 records. It is as if the band and record company erased the first 2 from their collective memories and want to push this same overrated watered down sellout version of g.g.d.'s music on all of you. If you like the stuff they shoved down your throat for the better part of the '90's to now then by all means buy this. If you are like me and want quality goo goo dolls the way they used to be, before they sold out their musical vision, then buy ""First Release"" and ""Jed"". They are both truly rare masterpieces."
5,How did I miss these guys?,"Somehow I missed this band, they just slid under my radar screens. I don't listen to a lot of pop radio, that might explain it. I'm a singer/guitarist who's on the far side of 40. I have a strong love of guitar bands. A young co-worker of mine turned me on to this record and I'm glad he did. What do we have here? Song after glorious hard-edged yet melodic song. Great lyrics, great drumming, great guitar tone and that all-too-rare quality of making you *believe* that rock songs *matter*. If this record is a collection of their non-hits, then I'm amazed. There's real talent here in this band. Who needs hits anyway when you can listen to great album cuts like these?"
4,A nice selection which breaks convention a little,"Some might blast this album for it excluding Iris, Dizzy, Black Balloon, et. al from the list. This isn't a problem, however...anyone who really liked all those songs more than likely bought dizzy up the girl and, therefore, has all 5. What this album brings is a refreshingly well-picked collcetion of their earlier work. This methodology is even more refreshing considering that their first self titled album has become something of a collector's item (not sure about the rest of you, but I can't find it in any store). Overall, a solid collection of songs, and a great way to look back for those of us who ran into them with ""Iris"" or ""Name"" and want to get a window on their past. Pick it up, you won't regret it."
3,Depends,"If you only heard ""Dizzy up the gurl"" or never bought a ggd album. Then this album is a must buy which includes almost all their best songs and many of their better songs were never hits. But if you got all of their CDs, then I would say it's a waste of money and time to buy this CD. You would only be buying a cd with songs you have already. The remix are impossible to tell unless you're a picky freak. You will hear many ggd's fan here who support the CD but those are the too obsessed fan. They will buy goo goo dolls bubble gum if they had it."
2,review staples,The staples rate 5 stars. Amazon shipping gets none. I ordered 5 different sizes of these staples. Each one was shipped separately. After opening each box I had to find coffee cans for the staples. The boxes were are ripped up and the staples were all loose in the shipping boxes. One strap of duct tape around the ends would have saved the whole problem.
5,A stunning account of early aviation history,"While not a military title per say, Wings Across America: A Photographic History Of The U.S. Air Mail is a stunning account of early aviation history and surely will find many an interested reader among those who gravitate from military accounts to stories of U.S. air endeavors. Beautiful duotone vintage photos capture the spirit of early U.S. postal efforts, covering both the aircraft which served as mail carriers, their designs, and those who flew the mail. The blend of rare and vintage full-page photos and extensive detail on both planes and mail service makes for an exceptional coverage."
2,Disjointed and hard to figure out where it is going.,Seems like the author jumbled a whole lot of miscellaneous writings together under one cover. The topic and information is important but for me is forgettable.
5,Broad overview to understand the many origins of shame,"Shame has a myriad of origins, this book gives an excellentunderstanding of shame and its effect upon our lives. It helps us todifferentiate the important difference between guilt and shame. Shame deeply effects our self esteem as well as how we view others and eventually our success in life. John Bradshaw, who is also an excellent writer, in his book regarding shame mostly limits his approach to those from alcoholic families. In this book, not only is this area covered but many other areas along with the developmental dynamics of shame and shame-based behaviors. Not coming from an alcoholic family I did not understand my own deep feelings of shame until I read this book. I highly recommend it for any persons who wish to understand themselves better on their road to becoming a more complete, self-accepting and healthy person."
4,I <3 Franceska,"Got this CD as a gift from a friend and fell in love with it. The song ""Diego"" has been stuck in my head for weeks."
5,Please don't ever retire!,"I started this strip several years ago, went back and read it from the start, and absolutely love it! It is one of my all-time favorite strips along with CALVIN AND HOBBES. If Mr. Kirkman and Mr. Scott take the suggestion that another reader-reviewer has made and retire, I promise that I'll throw a fist-pounding, foot-kicking, ear-numbing temper tantrum worthy of Zoe and Hammie combined! :)Seriously though, BABY BLUES is wonderful entertainment. When I think of all the adventures in parenting that Darryl and Wanda have had over the years (from visits with Santa to visits to Cowboy Monkey Band Land) I just start giggling in fond remembrance. Someday I hope I can be half the parent these two are!Read BABY BLUES. It's a feel-good treat that never gets sappy."
3,This series is starting to run out of steam,"I have all the previous 10 Baby Blues albums and would give every one of them five stars. But judging by this very uneven collection, the authors are starting to run out of steam. The problem is that the older Zoe gets, the more she encroaches upon the territory which rightly belongs to Calvin and Hobbes. Perhaps a well-timed retirement would be the best solution"
4,good book for beginner,good book for beginner who wants to know about ETFs (like me). helped me in reviewing my holdings.satish paul
1,E-BOOK HAS PROBLEMS,I recently purchased the e-book since I'm located overseas (in Saudi Arabia) and postage is sometimes more than the cost of the books. It also takes in excess of 3 weeks to get mail here from the States. I purchased and downloaded the e-book and was all set to print. I could only print the first 14 pages and then was notified by the Abode print driver that I could not print any more pages that day. After doing some checking I found that permissions were set by the publisher that only allowed printing 35 pages every 7 days - what a rip off!!! By the time I can finally print the last pages we'll be celebrating July 4th 2004 (well maybe not that long). But the idea that printing is being restricted after purchase is outrageous. I have written Amazon to inform them. At the very least the publisher should advise of this practice BEFORE YOUR PURCHASE. I will not purchase any e-books until this practice by Wiley is discontinued.
4,Nice Lighting,They met all expectations.For who it may concern (Halogen bulbs produce significant amounts of heat under and on top of the bottom shelf of a cabinet that may affect a heat sensitive product).My light look and work great.
4,Captivating Reading,"""A Divine Appointment in Washington, DC"" by Chaplain James Linzey is captivating reading. It always gets our attention when something occurs in our Nation's capitol, but when Washington, DC and the Eternal Spirit of God, through Jesus Christ, collide, we can quickly become riveted to know all the details! I couldn't lay this book down until I read it all. This book is wonderful!"
5,Great comedy with Paul Newman,Most people don't think of Paul Newman as a comedic actor. This is one of those rare opportunities to see him in a film that shows how versitile an actor can be. Too bad he didn't make more.
1,lousy!!!,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen starring Paul Newman. His agent obviously couldn't or didn't find him a better vehicle. His talents were absolutely wasted on this nothing of a film What a shame that his wife, Joanne Woodward also had a role in this farce of a movie. Don't waste your time."
5,Rally Round the Flag Boys,I have waited a long time for this to become available and even better in DVD. Thank You
4,Pleased with many of the arrangements,"As an intermediate-level piano player, I was pleased with many of the arrangements in this collection. I particularly enjoy playing ""After the Love is Gone,"" ""Boogie Wonderland,"" ""Fantasy,"" ""Reasons,"" & ""September."" They sound amazingly true to album/CD versions, even with ME playing them! Some of the songs didn't translate as well and a few others I didn't really know. But overall, I was pretty happy with this book."
2,Disappointed,Although I appreciate being able to ressurect this wonderful music. The quality was lacking. Music barely legible (meaning ink has faded and in some places to thin too see). This group is worthy of much better representation. If you have a better quality and send it to me I would be more than happy to retract.
3,"cool sheet Music,but I also wanted more",I was hoping for a full book&things.EWF Is One of My All-Time Favorite Musical Acts Ever&I was hoping for more than getig Sheet Music.but that ain't all bad either but still I wanted something along the lines of the Booklet that i got from there 1992 Box set.Oh well hopefully one day a Proper Book on them Uncut will come.
5,Gorgeous book of an amazing painter,"What a terrific book about a truly creative Russian painter! The illustrations are wonderful-- lush with beautiful color. If you know who Boris Kustodiev is, you must get this book! If you don't know who he is and love the colorful works of Matisse and Bonnard, then you will probably fall in love with Kustodiev's paintings and theater illustrations. The book book is worth every penny."
3,Enjoyable roots rock,"Scott Miller's ""Thus always to tyrants"" is an album of both roots rock (for example ""Miracle man"" and ""I made a mess of this town"") and traditional country (as in ""Dear Sarah"" and ""Highland country boy""). There's even a bit of punk rock inspiration in ""Goddamn the sun"". For fans of especially John Hiatt and Steve Earle, this album should indeed be checked out. Even if you're big hero is named Ryan Adams, I guess there's a chance you'll like Scott Miller. ""Thus always to tyrants"" is a good album and it have enough variation to remain enjoyable, but do not expect a masterpiece."
3,Awfully strange,"I liked the V Roys and this album sounds good, too. But has anyone noticed that ""Daddy Raised A Boy"" uses the exact same melody as ""After the Hurricane"" by the Blue Chieftans? Check out the Big Rock Truck Stop album from 1993 on Diesel Only Records."
4,Great album if a bit too slick,"I am a fan of Miller's and the Viceroys (ok, V-Roys). The album is really fun to listen too for me - especially since seeing him play smarta$$ acoustic music in a college bar called Hawkeye's back a while.He really has hit a stride with his writing, and the music is wonderful. The only thing bugging me is the slick production and polished sound. While impressive, it sounds too mature for the enthusiasm he shows at live shows. Granted his live show are very well played by his band but the rawness doesn't come thru on this otherwise excellent album."
4,80s synth pop,"I first heard this singer in the Michael J. Fox movie ""Bright Lights, Big City."" Her song ""Ice Cream Days"" plays during the fashion show and is on the soundtrack. She has an eclectic style. Some songs are reminiscent of Wang Chung like ""No Good"" with its detached vocals and driving rhythm. Other songs are more playful, teasing, and ambiguous, like ""Car Wash."" She sings in kind of a mechanical way on some songs, but others show more emotion (like ""Luke""). The CD is short at just over 38 minutes, but the songs flow together well and have a consistent quality despite their stylistics variations. There are not really any bad songs, but they are all pretty lightweight. If you enjoy soft pop, like Lauren Christy's debut (before she changed to a harder sound), you may like Jennifer Hall, and vice versa. It's not going to win any awards, but has a few memorable songs that stand out for its genre and era."
3,"Good Effort, But Lacking & Confusing.","As an outsider attempting to study, then explain the history of Chinese secret societies and organized crime, Mr. Booth obviously conducted extensive research. For this he should be commended.Yet, as a native-speaking Chinese , I was confused by the translations, which were inconsistent throughout the book. More importantly, it appeared that major crimes were also reported, simply to include them but totally missing their true origin, motive and intent.For a better understanding of Asian organized crime and its impact on our communities, readers are encouraged to pick up ""Chinese Playground"" by Bill Lee, ""Fires of the Dragon"" by David Kaplan, and ""The Dream Shattered"" by Du Phuoc Long."
3,It Was Just OK.,Used it to pull wiper arm on Honda Accord.Pro.1. Well contructed of solid material.2. Reasonable price.Con.1. The device is too wide. Could not fit into the narrow space of the wiper arm. Had to modify by using a flat head screw driver with it.
5,Very easy to remove battery post,"Very neat tool to remove battery post without twisting or jerking cables try to pull them out from battery .This tool also can be used to remove windshield wiper arms or other small job need to slowly easy to pull out the part. Good to have in tool box, special for mechanic use to replace battery when remove cables ."
4,Misleading Item Photo,"I rated four stars instead of five because the product I received is different than the one in the picture. The one I got has a plastic cone instead of a metal cone.Minutes after I opened the box, I got to try this tool on a stuck battery terminal on a Nissan Maxima. It pulled right off with no effort at all. It works GREAT for stuck battery terminals.Stuck battery terminals are very common on the Ford Edge, Mazda 6, Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ. The factory tightens these too tight causing the lead terminal to mushroom into the slot in the terminal. This puller can overcome the softness of the lead and pull the terminal up and get it off. In the case that the terminal under the windshield cowl is the one stuck, unbolt the other side of the battery cable from the body - it's usually nearby. Then remove the terminal with the battery and cable off of the vehicle."
2,Just A Pile Of Crunk,"I am from the capital of Crunkness and that's the ATL. While I am proud and I believe in supporting local talent, Lil Jon & Eastside Boyz will NEVER get a dime from me. Oh, I will admit I listen to their cds, especially if I want to get a party jumping or if I am feeling kinda wicked driving down I-75 or I-20 (in the ATL). But other than that, I will never buy this mess. I will say this to the group's defense, at least Lil Jon is truthful about the purpose of his ""work"" (he's all about partying and having fun). Whereas, 50 Cents tries to say he's a ""gangsta"" when really he's not. 50 is basically the same type of artist as Lil Jon without the crunkness(IMO).I have listened to this cd and it serves only one purpose. That purpose is to get crunk. But this ""music"" can be dangerous to a kid who's trying to learn proper English."
1,VERY STEREOTYPICAL OF THIS GENRE.,This is a fine example of the type of garbage which is spewed out and forced fed by mtv to alot of stupid suburban white kids who want to be black.All of the songs are characterized by the same commercial hip hop beats that sound like a super mario nintendo game.The lyrics are senseless cussing and about acting like a thug from the ghetto.This album further enhances the stereotype that black people are loud and absurd because all the rappers on this album simply yell out the lyrics.Even the cover art displays all that I have said on this review.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!
4,Rabid rap,"This CD is messy music. Just a bit of mayhem. Much of the time LiL Johnny and his boys sound like looney potential rapists, and you almost visualize the foam from their mouths being spluttered all over as they voice;) This CD is raw and fun though, and that's about it."
4,good overall cd,"this cd is sweet... i like it a lot. but, there are some songs that dont belong. thats why i only gave it 4 outta 5. the best songs are throw it up, b*tch, get low, play no games, rep yo city, i dont give a f*ck, and push that n*gga, push that ho. I suggest this cd to any hardcore rap fan. If your not a hardcore rap fan give it a try anyways."
5,Crunker's dream!,"In my mind, rap and hip-hop should be fun to listen to - something to get your head bangin' and your body movin.' This album does that. Yes, it's cheesy; yes, it's recycled.......but good grief is it fun! You can tell that that's the main goal of these guys: not to make an album that you can sit in your chair and lounge to, but to make an album that'll make you get out of your seat and crunkin'! Definitely check out ""I Don't Give A..."" and ""Get Low,"" the two best tracks on the disc."
1,This is why hip hop sucks today,"I will start off by saying that i do not own this album. But, I can tell you that if you want to hear Lil Jon, just turn on the radio and listen for about 10 minutes; you are almost guaranteed to hear at least one of his songs or one with him in it. And if you don't know, he is the annoying one yelling in the background (a time in which any real rap fan turns off the radio). This is not rap. This is club scene garbage. Don't waste your hard earned money on this album. If you insist on owning it, burn it from a friend. Don't support talantless music by buying it."
4,Not bad at all,"Now, I have to say. Lil Jon's Kings of Crunk was really good. My favorite songs were ""Push That N***a, Push That H**"" and ""Rep Yo City"". I have heard ""Get Low"" many times on the radio, so I know that song too. I think 4 stars would be my ratings on Kings of Crunk. I found out this album was #1 on the Independent album charts. Yeah!!"
1,Is it possible to give this album negative stars?,"I can't believe so many people support this crap. Reading the first five or so reviews and hearing kids say ""this album is crunk"" and ""it's really tight"" and ""I like the beats."" Let me tell you, if someone asks you why you like an album and you say, ""because the beats are tight and the lyrics are tight,"" than you don't know anything about rap music. Please, please, please listen to what I am saying -- artists who make cd's like this are hustling you. If you buy this album thinking it's going to be really good than you are getting hustled. They don't care about making really good music, they just throw it all together as fast as they can, with recycled, cheesy, mind-numbing beats that sound like they are coming from a pinball machine, topped off with 8 guys yelling shout outs to various cities around the U.S. and talking about how tough they are.Fourteen dollars. That's a really expensive coaster, guys."
1,Garbage,"Lil' Jon has shown us all time and time again that he is one of the WORST rappers out there. He doesn't even have lyrics. Listen to ""I Don't Give A F**k"". He says nothing throughout the entire song but ""I got that west side in me/I don't give a f**k!/I got that east side in me/I don't give a f**k!"" This is possibly the worst rap album I have ever purchased. Even Lil' Wayne's sorry tail can do better than this fool."
1,kings of crap,"what kind of garbage comes out like this. another example of no talented music like this gets released. and for the guy who said rap evolves, well isnt that nice that rap evolves from poetic rappers to whack pop rap trash like this. very nice....way to go to destroy rap music for the people."
1,LISTEN TO UNDERGROUND RAP!,One of the worst rap albums ever although the beats are good if you have really nice subs in your car. What I'm saying is that no one should buy this album and they should burn off the internet and bump it outside with some subs and an amp.
2,sorry man,man its sorry no work put on it and play no games is is just a sequel because its trick daddy so why waste money like i did is mad so if you gonna listen to me dont get it and waste money dawg peace.
1,wack,"Man, this is another one of those cds that can only live off of good beats. I would never buy this album, but if they got the instrumentals to this album, I'll pick that up. Lil John's lyrics are HORRIBLE. No depth whatsoever!!!"
5,CRUNK MUZIK,"Lil Jon is the king of crunk. Best Songs are Throw It Up f/ Pastor Troy, I Dont' Give a F*** f/ Mystikal, Krazie Bone, and Knockin Heads Off f/ Jadakiss, Styles P."
2,I thought this was a comedy album!,"I loved Lil-Jon's appearance on Dave Chapelle's ""Chapelle Show"". He was absolutely hilarious. I'm actually surprised he took the part. But this is just some obnoxious rap music. Just cuz he gets a few laughs doesn't mean he should start a rap career. He should stick to comedy!"
1,Insults the listener's intellegence.,"Everything about this album is either:A. HorribleB. Just plain stupid orC. Extremely annoyingEven the cover of this album, which features some idiot with fake teeth (I'm assuming that this is that ""Lil' John"" person or whatever)and a stupid smile, is extremely annoying. This is just another one of those groups that try to get by on good beats, while having absolutely no talent whatsoever."
1,YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,"Mc'ing at its worst.He's not even an mc , he's a YEAHHHHHHHHHH sayer.Man give me a chance , this music SUCKSSSSSSS."
1,Someone call 911 Hip Hop is dying!!!!!!!,"When is this vicious cycle of commercial [...] It is going around like a bad string of herpes!!!! We started with the conscious era then went to gangsta, now we are in the commercial phase. When are the saviors of hip hop going to save us from the likes of Lil john, Nelly and Chingy. Who is our Neo to get us out of this Matrix?"
1,is this what they call MUSIC?,"This is flat out the worst, most commercialized crap i've ever heard. When are people out there going to wake up? How did these guys get a record deal? Who were the morons that said ""Oh yeah, I love the way you scream the same tone in every single song, this flat out says STAR.""All the people rating this album with 5 stars are very uneducated...they can't even spell.And what is that stupid cup he's always holding? Wow. Everyone who listens to this needs to get a life along with a new set of ears."
1,HORRIBLE,this cd is by far the worst album I've heard EVER.don't buy this unless you let MTV run your life and are 14.my god someone needs to put an end to music like this.
2,"AHHHHHHHHHHHH, look I can scream to lil jon","Awww man He and his little crew is awful. Alot of my friends tend to disagree, but also alot of my friends smoke alot weed and do other negative things that burn brain cells. Lil Jon and his goons are too corny for my taste. The eastside boys cant rap,neither can Lil jon, but atleast the eastside boys dont yell like retarded kids on the little bus all the damn time. Getting Crunk(loudly annoying) is a southern style i guess im from Ohio so maybe thats why I think they suck. But it doesn't explain why my friends like them maybe the weed does. I dont like Lil Jon or anyone he produces or hangs out with on a regular basis,But they do know who to collab with to make a hit. The only reason why i listen to the album or any of their albums is because the other people on their songs are tight. I would have gave this album 1 star but the artist they collab with are cool."
1,SOUTHERN RAP SUCKS,"Where the hell did all these southern rappers come from; just a few months ago I was getting to know ginuwine and 50 cent and then all of a sudden these overenergetic rappers from alabama pop up like daisies. The only rap I listen to is smooth (jay Z), poetic (Nas), or gangsta (Biggie/Tupac) rap and if I want some commercial gangsta (50), but never southern, stay in alabama, newyork aint ready and probably will never be. Don't hate fellas I'm just speakin the truth."
3,YEAH!!!!!!,"Kings of Crunk is probably the most loved and hated rap CD ever. Me? I'm a little bit of both. The good side is that the beats on this CD are tight and has good guest apperances. The bad side is there is no serious songs, (party songs only) Lil Jon says YEAH, WHAT, OKAY more than he does rapping verses, the eastside boyz don't say s**t, and too many guest appearances. The thing that saves every song is the good beats. Let's be serious, if it weren't for the beats, no one would gave this ablum good reviews. Lil Jon, on your next album, make the ESB do something, work on your writing skills, and tone down the guest appearances. If you like loud ass music with niggas screaming on the top of their lungs, this is for you."
2,"""Rep Yo City""","This CD is the third release of lil' jon and the eastside boys. I first heard this in my cousin's car, from the beginning. The intro is kind of stupid, but then I heard ""throw it up (with pastor troy)"" and I thought that song was hot. the rest of the album is alright, i guess. The best tracks are the one with jadakiss, the one with krayzie, the one with e-40, and the pitbull solo.In the middle of the album, it seems as they flip the whole script for the ladies. There are a run of songs with r & b type beats and women vocals.2 stars for the best tracks, but its missing 3 because it is basically a mainstream album.I would say cop this one, but I would recommend ""put yo hood up"" before you pick this one up."
2,Lil Letdown,"Off of the success of the 1st ""official"" album released, Throw Yo Hood Up, I thought this album would be off the chains. But alas, it was not. The beats on the first album are the only thing that saved the ""lyrics"", but the beats thumped so hard that everything else didn't matter. The beats on this album just aren't up to par. Even efforts like I don't give a F and get low don't even come close to the 1st album. My suggestion is to get the first one and check it out; then you can see how they fell off on this album. This was disappointing from the aspect of hop-hop and in terms of crunk music."
4,Kings of Crunk,"Out of nowhere, a group of three emerge and go platinum. ""Kings of Crunk"" surpirsingly provides entertaining songs. As Lil Jon lays down exceptional beats, his rather ""exciting"" vocals match up well with the weak, yet comical lyrics provided by the other two members of The Eastside Boyz. For an unkown reason, Lil Jon's nearly identical flow and unmistakeable voice never become a nusance through any of the 21 tracks on the album. Songs such as ""Play No Games"" and ""Nothins Free"" provide a refreshing break to loud ""crunk"" style that has been prefected by Lil Jon and the Eastide Boyz. Howver, from the first listen, it becomes apparent that the shine of the album is the ""became-club-anthem ""Get Low."" An interesting variation from recent rap is provided on Kings Of Crunk."
2,"Pretty hype, then gets annoying. 2 1/2 stars","I like about five songs on this CD, but alot of it sounds exactly the same. Good to hype up the club and have a good time, but no one really has talent on this CD. It ain't rap at all, just a bunch of wack ass yelling track after track. This is straight up bullsh*t. One needs heavy alcohol consumption to listen to this vasura!!!!!!!"
2,Lil Jon - Kings Of Crunk,"Not a good album. Crunk music is now basically ruining Hip-Hop.The lyrics are on this album, well theyre are hardly any to tell you the truth. At the lack of lyrics, there is show of energy which I like. This album has alot of energy through the rapping. Besides that, the lyrics are weak. Most songs have no concept or meaningful topic.The production, I like some of the production on here. Some songs like, ""Rep Yo City"", ""Pitbulls Cuban Rideout"", ""BME Click"". The rest of the beats are meh, decent but not great. Good for crunk I guess.Overall, I recommend this for crunk fans but for real hiphop fans, stay away."
1,KINGS OF DUMP,"All you hear iz lil jon screamin..""ahhhhh"" ""ahhhhh"" like he got somethin in hiz azz..why so many new rappers think theyre hardcore by screamin....like thiz fool name lil jon or bone flusher (bone crusher)....lil jon aint hardcore....my friends listen to thiz crap and think hes str8 with hiz muzik....(yeah right).....they offered me and want to burn me a copy of thiz cd...i told him hell naw...but he still gave it to me....when i took the cd...the only thing i really like about the cd is that you can use it as a flying disc...it looks pretty cool when it fliez...i got upset when it got to a roof of the house...damn"
1,I CAN YELL TOO,Wow this cd is horrible. All it is is yelling...there is only one decent song on here...otherwise there is nothing to this album at all...don't waste your money!
3,Play No Games,That track is off the hook but really that is the only one that stands out to me every thing else is average crunk music
3,"GET LOW, GET LOW!!","Lil' Jon and the Eastside Boyz music can be one of two things (or both). it can either be good fighting musik or good clubbin' get the hoes muzik, but to comment on the album, it's pretty good considering the fact that i still think it should be called ""Lil' Jon"" rather than having the ""Eastside Boyz"" in the name since u never really hear them rap, just shout chants in the background. But songs like ""I Dont Give A F*ck"" ""Get Low"" ""Push that N*gga, Push That Hoe"" and ""Rep Yo City"" are my favorites, the rest of the songs are kind of stale after that, but crunk music is always good music in my book!"
5,I'm amazed,"After I downloaded the whole CD, I couldn't help but go out and buy the real CD. Lil Jon East-Side Boyz has to be one of the top 5 rappers out on the market as of today. Pastor Troy is in a couple of tracks, people who don't know who Pastor Troy is (he's on the rise), another 50 cent in the making. I find it hard to beleive Lil Jon aint getting much media attention. Anyways I suggest if you want a hot cd, Lil Jon provides more than a hot cd. This cd is off da chain.........SERIOUSLY.....OFF THE ... chain, as Lil Jon would say."
1,Train Wreck,Dave Chappelle is a better Lil' Jon than Lil' Jon. More value as a coaster than it will ever have as music.
1,www.sportofdistraction.com,"I feel horrible that there are people, fully developed human beings, that find entertainment in this album. It really upsets my stomach like a greasy steakum sandwhich cooked in recycled oven grease. The only entertainment this album should provide is that of comedy...after the 3rd song, what's new? You could play 1 of the songs on repeat 17 times and the listener wouldn't be able to tell whether or not they just heard the entire album.Stop Hatin'?..are you for real? The emotion of hate exists for reasons such as this album...not out of jealousy, but out of pure disgust."
2,lil' jon isn't anything more than king of crazy noise,"even though lil' jon is one of hip hop's most notoriously popular producers (next to kanye west), in the studio is where he remains. lil' jon does belong with MC's but not in the recording booth with them. kings of crunk is highly dissapointing not only for his disorderly style, but for lil' jon's musical skills. he has NONE, only screaming one word pump ups like 'okay!' and 'what?!' and 'let's go!'. think of this album as more of a compalation album of hip-hop stars that nobody's really heard of. only listen to this album if you like lil' jon (god forbid his musical skills) or high/drunk and need some crazy music to blow some steam, which sadly people actually do. nice try lil' jon but we're not impressed."
4,You either love it or hate it!!!!,"Either you love this CD or you hate it. Its that simple. I just hate hearing people say ""Lil Jon sucks, he's not a real artist"" Lil Jon has said plenty of times that he isnt a rapper and that all he wants to do is make music that will make people get crunk in the clubs. So if you dont like the hyped up, crazy music you wont like this. But if you do, you'll love it. I just wish people would stop hatin and give then credit for just trying to help other people have a good time.The guest appearances on this album are great, Pastor Troy, Mystikal, Krazie Bone, Jadakiss, and lots of others."
2,Kings of Crunk,"lil jon and the eastside boys r the kings of crunk. the c.d. snappin but my favorite song is get low. everytime u hear it u have to dance. they kno how to rep tha atl. wit appearences from pastor disastor, krazie, trick, and oobie the c.d. is jammin."
4,The south always prevail,"Well first and foremost, i'm from the south( Alabama that is ) and I really can say this is one of the albums that put the south where we at now. I'm not saying this is the greatest or one of the greatest albums lyrically but at the same time 95% of the songs on this album is catchy. People hate on the south because of what we bring to the table. Thats pure realness. I see a lot of comments about we're too crunk or theres no lyrics, well, first the whole south is crunk, and if you want lyrics we got other rappers for that, Eightball@ MJG /T.I./ Scarface/ UGK/ Outkast/ Jeezy, anyways these rappers talk about how we doit in the south, not anywhere else, so love it or leave it. And for all you haters out there. If you hate our music so much, stop buying it and playing it in your whips"
2,"I like lil Jon , but he is just one liner.","I like lil Jon , but he is just one liner. He either said what? ,yeah, ok , he doesn't rap. its gives 2 out of 5"
4,^^GeT CRuNk^^,"I love this cd! Sure it's loud, sure it's repetitive, sure lil jon has absolutely no MC'ing skills, but that's what makes it so great! This isnt a cd you can take completely seriously, and it's not meant to be. If you want to act BUCKWILD and get ^^CRUNK^^ then DEFINITELY BUY THIS!!!!"
2,Rap's worst!,"What the hell is this? The only things you can actually hear are: ""YEAH"", ""WHAT"", ""ok""!!!! I mean this is cr*p!I gave this CD 2 stars because of two songs I like: ""Get Low"" and ""I dont give a F---""!If you think that's REAL rap music then you have no idea what's going on in rap world!Try some good artists/bands like:DMXDa BandLudacrisJoe BuddenFabolousetc...."
1,If I could give it a zero I would,"Just notes on this album:1. All they do is yell, yell, and yell2. Can hardly understand what they say3. Beats are annoying.4. Songs make no sense/?/?5. A ?: Is this what rap has come too? To people that can't rap making millions of dollars?? LOL."
4,"Fine CD, just not top of the line, but among the 70's best!","Probably a 5-star if it was anyone else,but I put Paul on the same level as the three (not 4) ex-Beatles,and Brian Wilson solo.I've always enjoyed this album,even if it does seem overly cute and childish at times. MOTHER AND CHILD REUNION I skip when possible, but DUNCAN,with it's sly mellow humor still rings true,as does RUN THAT BODY DOWN, and CONGRATULATIONS. My favorite here has always been PEACE LIKE A RIVER, a truly original piece nicely backed up with some nice solo guitar too. The rest, for me, are decent enough, but not tip top,like the aforementioned. This is also my favorite Paul Simon solo CD,even though there is nothing here as good as AMERICAN TUNE from Rhymin Simon...A solid job in any case!"
5,Incredible! (no surprise there),"I am 16 years old, and a huge PS/S+G fan. I own nearly all the their albums, and this one is definately one of my favorites. As his first solo effort, you could not ask for anything better. It steps away from the S+G era, with darker, more ""sad"" lyrics that were usually not present on S+G recordings, with the main exception of ""Sounds of Silence"". ""Duncan"" is a true, lyrical masterpiece and their are of course old favorites such as ""Mother and Child Reunion"" and ""Me and Julio..."" All the songs offer pure Simon lyrics and depth, and even the intstrumental ""Hobo's Blues"" is a pleasure to listen to. This is just one of the many terrific PS albums and it shows similarities to ""Still Crazy After..."", yet in my opinion, this is a better overall album than the latter. If you are a diehard PS fan, than you will really appreciate this album, and if you are a first time listener, you WILL get hooked."
5,Very fine,"Simon's first solo album is direct, honest, funky, simple, and superb. His guitar playing has never been better, and it helps convey his private agonies without any pretentiousness. As ever, Simon is musically inventive and well-produced: listen to the last moments of ""Congradulations."" It's a wonder."
2,"Great songwriting, terrible remastering.","I like Paul Simon and I like this album. Actually, I like Paul Simon and I like this album a LOT. Even so, the sound quality of this album is abysmal. I don't consider myself an snobby audiophile at all, but the skips, pops, jumps, and hiss distract from such a wonderful album.If you listen in the car or on an iPod you should be fine. But if you listen to your music on a stereo or through nice headphones, you may be disappointed."
3,Need more Vinnie!!,"I grew up near the original (and now only) Baked Potato in North Hollywood, which opened in 1970. I've attended literally hundreds of shows there. While this CD has some special moments, most notably Vinnie Colaiuta's spectacularly slippery drumming on ""Mercy Street"", it falls short of capturing the true BP sound and improvisational spontaneity. I've seen Jeff Richman a couple of times at the original BP and he's better than this 2-disk set represents. My advice to fans of this disk is to pick up Greg Mathieson's ""Live at the Baked Potato 2000"" double CD. It features Vinnie, Abe Laboriel and Mike Landau shredding from start to finish. Better yet, just go there."
3,"The last of the ""early Madonna"" tracks...","And what a way to move out of the total fluff dance pop era. ""Who's That Girl?"" is a fun song, and ""Causing a Commotion"" rocks the house. Who would have thought that these would be the close of one sound, and the intro for the brilliant ""Like a Prayer"" experimentation era of Madonna.The rest of the album, that is the other songs than the two mentioned above, is garbage. This is the only place to find the two songs, though, so get it for that reason alone.Gosh, isn't Madonna awesome!"
3,Worth only for the Madonna tracks,"I did not see this movie and bought the CD only for my collection. So so sountrack with good dance songs, specially the ones from Madonna: Can't Stop, The Look of Love, Who's that girl (A number 1 track) and one of my all-time Madonna favorites Causing a Commotion, love this song that peaks at #2 in the billboard charts."
2,That girl's not very good here,"Who's that girl is an essential purchase because it's the only place where you can get ""who's that girl"" (a #1 hit), ""causing a commotion"" (a top 10 hit) and ""the look of love"" (a moody early ballad in the tradition of live to tell). The other Madonna song ""can't stop"" is dreadful and like the rest of the material on this soundtrack represents the over-synthed dreck that represented pop music in the 80's: it sounded good at the time, but, boy, it sure doesn't hold up now. If The first three songs were available on other compilations I would have given this one only 1 star and advised you to stay clear."
2,"Despite a gem, Madonna's worst album","This was the last Madonna album before her songs began to become more serious. And while I want to say she ended her ""fun music"" days with a bang, she didn'tWho's That Girl- A very cute and fun song, and her best cut on the album, but it's far from her best. BCausing A Commotion- It's just as good as the first track, but for some reason I just don't like it as much. I just don't really get the song, I suppose. C+The Look Of Love- Oh my God. When I first heard this song, I thought it would NEVER end. I could barely listen to it. Not a good slow song by any standards. D-Can't Stop- It's better than Causing A Commotion, but it's painfully generic, and it seems like Madonna didn't really seem into it. B-I never listen to the non-Madonna tracks, so I can't give my opinion on them. Buy this album when you have all other Madonna albums. This is not her finest moment."
2,not a Madonna album,"It has only 4 songs of Madonna, and 3 of them are goodyes, Who's that girl, causing a commotion are great singles, but very soon went outdated and forgotten. I guess thats why she wouldn't include them in the Immaculate Collection"
3,only 2 wonderful songs,"Only ""Who's That Girl?"" and ""Causing A Commotion"" are good songs on here. If you like these songs, I recommend just buying the Import Singles, they'd be worth more."
3,Couldn't put music onto my laptop,"I'm not sure why but I wasn't able to put this cd into my iTunes. What I ended up doing was ripping it using Windows Media Player, burning a 2nd cd and then using that to put the music onto iTunes. I had to buy the whole cd just for 2 songs but I really enjoy the songs so it was worth it for me. The rest of the cd is so so."
4,"Good soundtrack--Love ""The Look of Love"" on it","Although this soundtrack has a spotty lineup, I liked the Madonna songs on it. I didn't get this album until the summer of 1989. But I played it a lot that summer. My favorite song on here is Madonna's ""The Look of Love."" I like the somber mood of the song and the keyboards playing on it. It should have been on her 1986 ""True Blue"" album--sounds like a slower version of the fast paced White Heat on there. But I like the hits of Who's That Girl and Causing a Commotion. Club Nouveau's '87 offering following that mega '86 album success is just as good. The others are mainly dance numbers that want to sound like Madonna's songs. Didn't like the movie--it was a stinker big time--I felt that Madonna should have sticked to music, which she's very good at to this day. The soundtrack more than makes up for that summer '87 box office bomb."
4,QUIEN ES ESA NINA! (whos that girl),"Well Its an adorable soundstrack. With catchy late 80's tunes even my 4 year old niece caught on to whos that girl,she hums it and tries to sing it the best she can. I think little kids today between ages 4 and 7, will like that song if radio brought it back, its kiddy like!!also causing a commotion. she likes to here over and over. the movie confused her cause the madonna she knows is from the Music era. I had explain that madonna changes and she was not born yet. Like i read in one of theses reviews, this is a madonna fan collectable.."
4,Who's That Girl Sountrack,"Im not sure how it give 1/2 stars. But regardless Im enjoying the CD very much. Had it on Cassette way back when and just recently got the DVD that I used to have on VHS. Seeing the movie again reminded me about the soundtrack so i came here to Amazon and ordered it. I love the Movie and I think it only got bad reviews way back when because the critics just didnt like Madonna and so automatically gave it bad reviews/press. Loved the Movie so much kinda wore out the VHS tape lol. Anyway, Peace everyone."
4,Vintage Madonna.,"Who's That Girl is the ultimate Madonna soundtrack. There are 4 original songs that Madonna sings which include: Who's That Girl, Can't Stop, Causing a Commotion, and The Look of Love. The last song I have mentioned is Madonna's most beautiful ballad of the '80s, too bad it was never released as a single. I highly recommend this fabulous purchase if you are a huge Madonna fan like myself. Enjoy!"
4,Funny storyline,This movie was really funny. The storyline was a little out there but all and all it was a fun movie to watch. All Madonna fans will like it and so will those who like big cats!
3,Who's That Girl? Soundtrack,"Like the film it came from, Who's That Girl is a so-so project. The Madonna songs are fine, and of course who would buy it for the other artists? It has three fine Madonna songs (""Can't Stop"" is not one of them). The best would have to be ""Causing A Commotion"", which surprisingly is sort of underrated compared to heavy weights like ""Vogue"" and ""Take A Bow"". ""Who's That Girl"" is another great Madonna song-again, under appreciated. The biggest surprise I found was in ""The Look Of Love""-its so dark and Depeche Mode-like and is one of Madonna's best electronic songs. Who's That Girl holds three songs that are great but just have never made a huge impact. It is worth buying for these songs. Ignore the movie, ignore that horrible album cover, and you'll be fine."
3,Some good Madonna originals.,"The album has some great madonna originals, and a few late 80's band pop tunes to add to the mix."
3,MADONNA'S FIRST SOUNDTRACK...,"Madonna's first semi-soundtrack to Who's That Girl was nothing more than decent. I honestly think that Madonna should have done the entire elbum rather than just four of the nine tracks. But no, that honor has to go to Dick Tracy with the god-awful I'm Breathless album, but that's a different story.Who's That Girl, the openning track was latin flavored with a few latin lyrics in there with it's dark pop; I'd say it was appropriate for the title track. Causing A Commotion was, once again, dance by Madonna. The Look Of Love is a semi-ballad; it's dark and has a very, very slight latin sound in it. Can't Stop is a fun, uptempo pop song.As far as the other tracks, I really could care less. I would have liked to have given the album five stars, but I really don't feel that the entire album deserves it considering Madonna had the only good tracks. Her four tracks are fun, dark, and overall well produced."
4,"Label is incorrectly marked as 5/8""","I ordered the SX5035-12 which is a 7/32"" Crown x 1/2"" Leg staple. However, when I received the package from Amazon the label stated that it was a 5/8"" leg but had the same model number as the 1/2."" Initially, I failed to measure the staple and sent it back to Amazon. Amazon quickly sent me another box, which had the same labeling issue. I measured the staple and it is a 1/2"" staple. I called B&C and they were very nice and apologetic and stated that they are going to fix the label. Just be forewarned about this problem and measure your staples because there maybe a lot of stock still out there with incorrect labels."
2,"I agree with the consensus, take a pass on this one.","I bought this for a dollar at a resale shop. Shoulda had a V-8! Saved only one song (Can You Feel the Love Tonight).Those who said this music is too busy are right. Sounds like he should have turned off a few buttons on the synthesizer, especially the annoying drums on some of the songs. You'd think Synchronicity 2 is an April Fool's joke. It should be on NPR's ""Annoying Music Show."" I mean REALLY now.Music is so subjective... there's something for everyone out there. So I rarely write music reviews--only when I feel it's overwhelmingly good or bad, and I feel this one qualifies. This review is a tad tardy, but there you have it."
4,Fun little creepy noisemaker,"This toy has shapes that must be fit into openings, and then as the shape descends down a tube into the base of the toy, it makes a mooing or moaning sound. A little creepy, but cool. And it keeps my daughter interested."
4,Good recording!!,"Jeff Pilson is awesome on this cd. His vocals are out of sight. He is far more appealing than Don Dokken to me. He has great power and he really makes you want to sing with him. He wrote every song and did all his own harmonies also....smokin'!... He played his own bass tracks and also got some great guitar players including his band mate, Reb Beach. My personal favorite song was ""Playing God Again"". I'm not usually into all the quartet harmony singing songs although, I did really enjoy ""Cast the Stone"". Amazing!! This cd rocks. Highly recommended!..."
2,A little disappointed!!,"I was really looking forward to this release because Jeff Pilson is such a great and talented musician. The first time I put it on I was in my car going to work because that is how I rate any new c.d. I purchase. When I heard the opening track ""What cost war"" I was blown away. It sounded alot like a ""Dio"" song, I really like that song. Then I heard ""The night you walked away"" and said to my self this album really rocks. The third song ""Wrong place wrong time"" is o.k. but nothing spectacular. The fourth one ""Playing God again"" is a really cool song but I feel as though the music sounds kind of muddy on that one. ""Solitary world"" is a catchy tune which I happen to really like and then the sixth one ""In the dead of night"" is pretty cool. So far so good, then that's where the bottom totally fell out on the c.d. The next four songs are just brutal. I find myself shutting it off constantly after the sixth song. I still think Pilson is great but I am just disappointed in this c.d."
3,it's an expensive TOY,I guess I expected more from a $70.00 purchase. It IS a toy with a plastic handle. The gears make a very loud raspy sound and when the bell goes off it sometimes won't stop ringing OR it dies out sounding like a sick moose! It wasn't misrepresented in any way...but I'd like to save someone else the disappointment.
2,Cha-chingless,"The gears grind when coming to a halt, making it feel like it is stripping the wheels. YOu don't have to put coins in to spin the wheels. The light and bell are very weak when winning. This is not at all what I expected for the price. It is cheap."
1,"Good idea but,wrong buy","I brought this for my In-laws for Christmas, They loved it, but the thing stop working the very next day. It took them awhile to get it back to me and now I don't know if I can still send it back."
5,Very Funny,This toy arrived on Dec. 24 just in time for xmas. I got it for my special needs son because he loves change and he needed a bank. At first he was leary but when it won and the change came out he loved it. He took it straight to his room and doesn't want anybody to play with it. He's very smart and knows what its for. Great gift for David!
1,will no feed,"staples will no feed through my new Hitachi stapler. I think it has to do with the coating. I even tried to file down front of the guide, still would not feed."
3,Poorly packaged,Product is good quality but the packaging was poor at best. Box was busted and had staples everywhere. Need to improve the packing with much better grade cardboard or put in plastic container.
1,Boring,"How did this book get published? The main character goes through therapy to find out the main reason why he can't finish this script - how surprising issues with his mother.The whole book is about these Jewish women who were part of his mothers circle of friends who played Mah Jongg once a week. Their trials & tribulationsIt was the most boring book I've read. Had to skip over chapters to see where this book was going; basically no where. Characters boring and unrelatable.Good premise but not written well. Really, who cares!Don't waste your time"
3,cute but doesnt last long,this is really cute but mine broke only in a couple weeks of wearing. this is probably good if you change belly buttons every week.
5,Great Stripped Down Johnny,"I can only imagine how crowded the little Sun Studio in Memphis must have been when this great record was made - guitars,horns, back-up singers, bass, etc, and Johnny singing live. Just terrific versions of early Sun songs plus some of Johnny's hits in stripped down versions. His ""Memphis"" sounds just as strong as his original '60's recording at the Whiskey A Go Go. Johnny enlisted hall of fame musicians to lend a hand, the late Carl Perkins and James Burton, to name two. A shame the CD itself is out of print, but the MP3 is definately worth buying. Johnny Rivers in his strongest element; this had to be a great work of joy for him, and it shines through. Highly recommended. (P.S., if you ever visit Memphis, you gotta go to the Sun Studios on Union Street where so much recording history was made.)"
2,Not bad..but no cigar,"I'm not as wild about this album as some of Johnny Rivers' diehard fans, but it's interesting. Somehow most of the songs just aren't Johnny's bag."
1,Painful,"An utter disappointment. Considering the majority of this man's career has been based on covering other artists material, I'd have to think that he could have done much much better. Nearly every song on the album butchers the original, which is quite an exceptional feat considering how excellent the songs are when done by the original artists. If Mr. Rivers wished to pay tribute to them he'd have done a much better job by simply buying some shirts with their pictures. The lowest point of the album is when he attempts to redo some of his more famous songs. Poor renditions of songs that have already been done to death simply make the album drag on mercilessly. Additionally, the few uninspired Johnny Rivers written tunes don't seem to fit into the concept of the album. Quite honestly the best part of it was when it finally ended. This one will never get near my CD player again."
5,A must have for Cooder fans,This album is one of my favorites.If you like jammin nasty slide guitar from one of the best in the biz.This is the album for you.Get it now.Thank me later.
3,"Sometimes messy, but greatness shines inbetween","This is not Cooder at his best. Its very in the middle. It`s so overproduced and sounds like a terrible mess sometimes. Let`s forget that and consentrate on the good things.Track 1 Get Rhytm written by the late Johnny Cash has the rythm and the cooder magic. Fast and down to the point musicalwise. Track 7 I can tell by the way you smell has some magic too, but it`s to much sound sometimes, which kill`s the vocal. Track 9 Let`s Have a Ball has rock and roll feel too it, and the cooder magic . But the rest is not ""my cup of tea"" to be honest."
4,unforgettable,"left over crack is pretty much undescribable to someone who has never heard them. imagine the fury of grimple, the blast-beat drumming of dillinger, and the political critique of DK combined. the result is a sound unlike any other. if you tire of the worn-out, half-assed ""punk rock"" thats becoming popular, try out loc and try not to get too in to it. its pretty much impossible. enjoy!"
3,not bad but never as good as the original,"I have seen leftover crack many times and i don't think that this cd represents their raw style. This cd is way too overproduced and engineered. The first few tracks are excellent but then compared to their 7"" and demo they lost a lot of their hardcore style. Its a good cd to own but don't expect too much. Their Choking Victim CD and 7""'s are so much better... and then you can see how born to die was suppose to sound. Other suggested cds are vindictives, indk, no cash and stockyard stoics."
4,awsome ska-punk,Loc is awosme this cd is awosome. alot of the songs are the sameisdh but all have their own meanings. but the death metal songs arent good i usually skip them but this a great cd that will make you drool when you hear it for the first time.
4,squatter punk angst,"squatter punk angst with a happy kick ala Citizen Fish. just evil enough to keep me from feeling goofy and naive, just heavy enough to keep my attention. Leftover Crack is a lot like Choking Victim, but, ""if it ain't broken ....""."
1,Squatter Crack Ska,"This is the best punk album released in the last 10 years, one of the best all time. The political anti-rascist anti- homophobic anti-govt atheist, lyrics are some of the best in punk's history. The combination of hardcore heavy guitars with a lot of melody and the crack rock steady backbeat make for the most perfect punk sound i have heard. The production is quite amazing, reminding me of the smashing pumpkins siamese dream sonic wall of distorted guitar tracks. this is a must listen, full of energy. its truly one of the few punk albums recorded after the 90's worth listening to. Get it!"
5,Stainlesssteel nails are a mus have for outdoor projects and treated wood.,Fist Bosdtitch N88 (magnum n80) N80 nailers. use thes stainless steel nails on out door projects and treated wood. Thin enough to go through most boards without splitting. These nails are not as big a diameter as regular nails. Good stuff costs alittle mor but well worth it.
2,The Elizabeth Taylor Signature Collection,The tone is very bad on this otherwise good movie (Father of the Bride). The sound on VHS (tape) was much better. Hopefully the sound on the other movies will be of better quality.
5,GREAT!,"It was a great classical CD. Handel sonatas performed to perfection. I really have to say, it was great."
4,Good Vietnam experience,"Though the graphics for characters lack, the environments are lush and detailed, allowing them to be overlooked. The game play is difficult even on the lower settings, and finding checkpoints and save locations isn't always consistent. If you're looking for a relived Vietnam experience, I say go with this over its competitors, as it really delivers on almost all counts."
3,"Wonderful realism, but very difficult","I have been playing first person shooters since Doom was on the market. Men of Valor has wonderful graphics, story, and realism. The only aspect of the game I hate is the difficulty level. When the difficultly level is on easy I had to play some missions over 12 times! I pride myself on beating most games on medium to hard. If you like to play a mission over and over again this game is for you, but I like to progress through a game in a reasonable amount of time. Oh yeah, one more thing, there is one set number of enemies on a mission. For example, I was walking through the jungle with my squad and came upon a village of four to five huts; VC jumped out immediatly. I found cover behind a tree and picked then off with my M-14, but they never stoped comming. When I finished the mission I had killed 128(!) enemies in 4-5 huts. Overall the graphics, story, and weapons are great, but the difficulty level is like pushing a concrete block in the sand."
5,Factual account of Khomeini's political/ religious career,"Baqer Moin has the information to take you through all the twists and turns the Ayatolla took on the way to establishing his vision of an Islamic State in Iran. The author spends a lot of good words on Khomein's mysticism. From other books about Muslims I had gotten the impression that followers of Islamic mystics tended to be mellower and generally wished to get along with the outside world. But this is a false impression with regard to the Ayatolla, if you believe the author's analyis of His mysticism. --- ""For Khomeini the mystic, when Man reaches a sense of unity with God, his anger becomes that of God."" (page 296)."
1,Sad Ugly BooK,"Khomeini was nothing but a Psycho Maniac who was born in India and had no roots what so ever to Iran. He was a Murderer just like Hitler. According to many books that I have read his father died when he was 6 months old and his mother died a few years later. He used to take care of sheeps in the desert and in the mean while was taken care of by a women who used to wash the dead for a living. Khomeini was a very DEPRESSED individual in need of Psychological help. He, as I have read in many books, had also murdered an old blind man when he (Khomeini) was around the age of 15 years. So all of you who are trying to put a nice image for this murderous psycho maniac, get a life. This is the 21st Century and people are no longer fooled by such non-sense.....so just save it."
3,"Informative in some areas, dissapointing in others","The strength of the book is describing Khomeini's views towards Islam. It is very informative about mysticism and Khomeini's attachment to it. On the other hand, the book is not very detailed and I was yearning for more insight and information. There is little detail on the personality and personal life of Khomeini. Instead, the author focuses on the events that take place during Khomeini's lifetime more than Khomeini's life. In other words, I would recommend it for those who do not know much about history of 20th Century Iran. For those who have even a basic understanding of that period of Iranian history, I would not recommend it."
3,Boring,"I'm sorry - I so wanted to really like this album but it all sounds the same. It has good songs with good arrangements but it is boring - just like Roses In The Snow. It needs some faster paced material to liven it up. Get Bluebird, or Ballad of Sally Rose or Luxury Liner or Cimmeron way before this one."
5,EmmyLou Harris Angel band CD is heavenly,I purchased this CD a month ago and absolutely love it. It's one of those CD's that doesn't have a bad song but then with EmmyLou Harris you can't go wrong because she is that good. This is a must have CD for anyone who loves her music and enjoys the old time gospel genre. I seriously may have to get a spare copy simply because I play this so much it's that good.
5,Colorado Campgrounds,"This is THE book if you are going camping in Colorado just once, or for the whole summer. Many guidebooks are out of date or are reprints of Forest Service information. This guy obviuosly VISITED these campgrounds. If your like a lot of us and barely have one or two weekends per summer to go camping, get this book. It will allow you to pick a new place without the risk of ""trail and error""."
5,Best choice,"It's the best you can get. Clearly written, nice pictures and you read all the things you want to know. Classified for scenery, shade, privacy, r.v.'s and tents with the best site available. Perfect."
4,Good reference. Could be better.,"The book is a very good reference on a large number of campgrounds. It has a strength in that it provides pictures, unlike for instance the Moon guide. In my opinion, the book would be better if it covered the CGs more evenly: the authors' choices of ""best"" very often coincide with ""most popular"" (read: ""most crowded"") and the quieter campgrounds do not get the coverage that may be of interest to readers.Another annoyance I found is numbering of campgrounds. They are not numbered and listed in a logical order that would allow reading about closely located ones in a sequence. Instead, you can read on one and the adjacent one on the map is fife pages down, yet the next one in the text is 50 miles away. This makes one go back and forth between the map and the text if you are trying to get impression on CGs in a certain area.However, all this notwithstanding, I think this book is well worth having."
4,Title is accurate,"This book gives a more-complete review of campgrounds than Websites I have found. Gill also lets you know if the campground has tent-only sites, and a rough guideline for RV lengths. He gives reasons for his ratings, and lets you know if there are shaded sites, or not. Seems to be fair in his reviews."
5,GREAT BOOK!,We used this book to determine every campground we'll stay at in CO.The pictures were wonderful and the ratings were very useful. We are tent camping so it was nice to find a book that not only catered to the RV campers but the tent campers as well.
2,A Slow Start & A Predictable Ending...,It took me a while to get through this one only because it just didn't grab my interest as quickly as I'm used to a suspense thriller doing! It did have some surprises in the middle of the book but I saw the ending coming a mile away. It was just too predictable!
3,"Nice instrument, syahi degrades quickly though.","I bought this set in February or March of 2010. I play it daily for approximately an hour. The syahi on the dayan drum is chipping in several places and coming off. I don't know if the glue used was good quality. My instructor told me it is not ordinary for the syahi to degrade so quickly. I haven't been playing it overly hard or anything. There is also some unevenness on the edge around the dayan, which makes uniform tuning of that one drum impossible. Other than that, the drum sounds and feels great.Hope this is helpful!"
5,"Awesome graphics, cool gameplay!","This game gets repetative in somespots, because you always have the same goal in the levels:collect 8 keys. This game is very fun though. It has excellent graphics, excellent characters, and each level gets harder as you switch between level. The levels are all unique, too. This is an excellent family game for everyone in the family!"
1,too hard,This isnt that fun.This game is way too hard.Its really long to. If i were you id get woody woodpecker in crazy castle 5.
1,Good info but not worth the money.,I gave this 1 star.....17 minute video - $30 bucks....seriously can find this information else where for free. Good information just not worth the money.
