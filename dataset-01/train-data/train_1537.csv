2,ATHEISTS - A POLL,"The low score given to this book needs explanation. The book bored me to tears. However, i am not blaming the authors: I doubt I could have done any better at writing a book about poll results.The most interesting discussion involved the stories of ostracization told by some the Atheists in the poll. When they lost their faith, they did not desert their families and friends - their families and friends deserted them.The rest of the results paint a picture of the typical Atheist, who except for disbelief in religion, is not all that different from anyone else."
2,"Atheists, a subgroup of the ""nones""","This book should be of interest to people of all beliefs. The authors of this book have conducted a very detailed study into the viewpoints of American and Canadian Atheists, and compared them to Christian groups. The result are presented in a very detailed scientific manner yet in a easily understood way for the lay reader.The book is very easy to read and some the results are very surprising.It's not only a must read for Atheists, but also for people of all faiths."
4,A good start on understanding Atheists,"I highly recommend, ""Atheists: A Groundbreaking Study of America's Nonbelievers."" Though the authors readily admit that the study provides a much less than adequate statistical sample of atheists, still it is a start in trying to understand the attitudes, histories, and concerns of atheists in America. The book does not attempt to either endorse or remonstrate against atheism as a personal perspective which is handled by many others recent authors.If you are interested in people and how they think and see themselves against what they perceive as a hostel environment full of irrational religious people, this is a good addition to your library."
3,Great - except it was missing a movie....,"The movies are great except that one of the movies is on two discs. Dangerous When Wet is on its own dvd as well as being on the dvd for ""Easy to Wed."""
4,Not disappointed,"I really liked Esther Williams when her movies came on the late late show when I was a kid...These movies to me don't disappoint...I hadn't seen the one which was her first movie called ""Bathing Beauty"" with Red Skeleton. I really liked it...They even had an interviewed her about her life.... The extras were good as well...Overall I was very pleased with my purchase."
3,A lavish water spectacle...,"One MGM musical of the time launched a career that flourished for the balance of the decade... A champion swimmer and a tall, strikingly pretty woman, Esther Williams had played small roles in two MGM films when she was starred in ""Bathing Beauty."" She played a swimming teacher at a girls' school whose husband (Red Skelton) enrolls at the school to be near her...The plot was merely an excuse for knockabout antics by Skelton and especially for Williams' aquacades... The pattern was fixed for the rest of the series of popular light musicals she starred in: Williams as a smiling mermaid moving balletically underwater to the strains of a pleasing melody...Bathing Beauty's finale is a lavish water spectacle with the star as the focal point of intricate underwater formations..."
5,If you love corny (I do) you'll love this!,"Wonderful DVD set, beautifully restored. At most a few off-color frames, which is quite an accomplishment. Fantastic sound quality. Simple, sweet plot lines. Romance, comedy, great songs, and fun swimming or water ballet scenes spread throughout the five DVD's. Whether she's playing marbles with Van Johnson or resisting the advances of Peter Lawford, Esther Williams has a wonderful screen presence and of course looks great in and out of the water. Highly recommended for the nostalgia buff or light musical comedy fan. Enjoyable extras comprised of cartoons and news reels."
5,About Time,It is about time these Fantastic Esther Williams Movies are finally on DVD. They are a joy to watch. These movies besides showing Esther Williams at her swimming and acting best also have some of Hollywoods greatest as her costars. Swimming with Tom and Jerry is a great scene. And Singing Baby it's Cold Outside with Ricardo Montalban is a classic. These movies are worth buying.
3,Whimsical entertainment for a gloomy day,"I've just begun my DVD set, but I am already enjoying the fun loving antics of Esther Williams, RicardoMontalban and the great Jimmy Durante. There are some fun obscure songs, crazy choreography and Ms. williams is a marvel when wet!!!"
5,These make a wonderful gift,"I Love, Love, Love these! I put them in my computer's DVD player and watchingthem, I felt like I was swimming with Esther.Maybe Esther could tour the country to promote these, and physicalfitness. Can't wait for the next volumes. xxoo"
2,Didn't get what I paid for,"While I enjoyed the movies I could watch, I was really bummed to find that at least one disk didn't include the movie stated on the cover - half way through it suddenly morphed into something else. The movie it was supposed to be was provided on one of the other five disks, which means I really I got three out of the five movies that I paid for. Still contimplating whether to go through the pain of packaging it up and sending it back for a refund? It did cost me nearly $100NZ. Is it worth it?"
3,DANGEROUS WHEN WET OR DRY!,"These DVDs have been beautifully transferred. The films are entertaining but it is appropriate to say at this late date that Esther Williams is a minor actress surrounded by wonderful talent and gorgeous production values. Despite her swimming prowess, she was the Britny Spears of her day."
3,Not the loudest,"This piezo siren I bought for my GE alarm system when I installed it. I initially had it in the garage and it works OK, but found the volume a bit lower than expected. It DOES run off the built in power supply in the alarm panel, but I've since moved it to the basement, and bought a real siren (Ademco 702) for the garage....one that can almost wake up the dead! The disadvantage of that one is I have to run it with a separate power supply and relay. So if you are looking for something gawd awfully loud and are handy with wiring, get the 702."
5,tennis player and golfer,"Because of the ""cushiness"" of this visor, sweat gets absorbed before it reaches my eyes, which is wonderful! These visors are the best ... all my friends wear them, even when just driving around town."
4,Modern Instruments (at least 1961) and Performances,"Antonio Janigro introduced many people to Baroque music on Vanguard. This music was not as well known, nay ubiquitous, then, as it is now. Perfomance ideas and standards have changed much since 1961; these are lush, gooey performances with a modern orchestra. Yet they sparkle with charm and fluidity.And Anton Heiller was a great organist; listen to his continuo! Not authentic, but snappy and charming, making Haydn's all-too-well known concerto sound as it did back in '61 when it was fresh. And the trumpeters are fine as well. It sounds as if everyone is having fun, not laboring. Well worth the listen, and a very good transfer. And considering this is a straight ""What was on the LP is on the CD"" at 47 minutes, it's a good bargain too."
4,"Entertaining, but a bit far-fetched","This book is an interesting blend of fact and fiction. I recommend it for horror/suspense novel fans. It is well-written, in the same intriguing style as the author's true crime books, and I like the way it combines fact (Ed Gein's story) with fiction. However, if the reader is not already well versed in the true story of Ed Gein, he or she may have trouble knowing where the fact ends and the fiction begins. Still, it is an entertaining story, even if it is a bit far-fetched, as are most novels that try to mimic true crime."
5,HORRIFYING,"As I cracked open Outcry I figured it would be similar to any scary movie I had seen. Anyone who may be thinking the same thing is in for a surprise. Outcry tells the story of Ed Gein, perhaps the most deranged individual the US, or even the world, has seen. I almost hate to admit that I was fascinated by Gein. Outcry enables the reader to dive right into the mind of the police who happened upon Gein's house of horror. What is surprising was that Gein hid his psychotic tendencies for so long. We could each have an Ed Gein of our own living right next door. If you have a weak stomach definetly stay away from this book. This is no bedtime story..."
1,This is not as good as his Biography works!,"The biographies Mr. Schecter has completed are far superior to this(in my opinion only) really bad fiction piece. Stick to the biographies, they're incredible!"
2,Different styles,"I didn't read any of the biographic books by Schechter, but I readall the books with the Edgar Allan Poe character. My opinion isthat this Outcry book is far, far inferior to the Poe's stories.It is indeed hard to believe that the same person wrote both,given not only the diversity in styles, but also the differencesin the literary quality."
2,It was okay.,I'm a huge fan of Lamb Of God. But I mean this DVD is watch worthy but quality could have been alot better. Take my advise get Killadelphia. Know that is truely a DVD worthy of Lamb Of God.
4,Good Dvd at a GREAT Price,"If you love Lamb of God or are in to to heavy scene, this is a must buy. It ROCKS!!The videos are intense"
5,pantera?,Cool video! Kinda short but has great extras (hint: easter egg). By watching this I noticed that LOG is influenced by Pantera.
3,Does NOT Fit 1999 Legacy,Just got my filter today and I'm returning it because its the wrong filter for my car. I know its not a perfect system but the Amazon part comparability needs some tweaking.
3,Works but performance increase is negligble,2003 Subaru Outback 2.5 engine. It's a filter; it works... There might be a little smoother engine at above 2500K but no real improvement in gas mileage I can see.. So don't expect and incredible change other than replacing a dirty filter. But I won't ever have to replace this again.
2,Aweful,"This device would make a better melee weapon than remote. The design is bulky the programming configurations are aweful. The LCD is ultra sensitive, allowing you to inadvertantly perform commands with the slightest touch. It does not power off automatically and eats batteries like a Hummer eats gas. You are better off with a less expensive, slimmer device."
4,Great Remote Sony RM-AV2500,"This remote is absolutely wonderful. I gave this as a Christmas gift to my husband ( Mr Gadget Man) last year and he just decided to play around with it today. He did the easy stuff like programming the Sony systems which were a breeze. So of course I was left to read the rest of the manual and had to do the techie parts, which included programming or ""teaching"" the remote to read our Maxent televison remote. At first I thought I would be in for a daunting task, but it went smoothly. I then went on to add more programs to our Panasonic amp remote. I felt SO proud of myself......my husband just gave me this look as if to say "" I could have done that if I took the time"", but seriously I think we would still be using 8 remotes if we waited on him. All I can say is if you have the time to read a bit and some patience then you shouldn't have any problems. I didnt give it 5 stars because I haven't tried to use it for my air conditioner yet :) , so stay tuned.."
4,Not Compatible W/Cable/DVR box,"The only problem that we encountered w/this product is that it wasn't compatible w/our Cable/DVR box. Other than that, seemed to be a good product."
4,Useful,"Good size for carrying keys, cell phone, credit cards, & some cash while keeping hands free. Fabric is firm and has a solid feel. Zippers are strong. Very surprised at the value this little fanny pack provided."
3,The clasp seems cheap/difficult to open & close,"I love the size and color, but the clasp is hard to open/close and the zippers stick a bit too. I wish I could return it, but I'd pay as much for shipping it back as it cost in the first place. It's useable, just not as easy as I wanted it to be."
3,OK,"OK for the price. It meets my need, so I think it is ok.. nIce to store little things in as you walk"
3,A little too extra small,"Much smaller than I expected room wise. This item is truly made for a child and I would not recommend that any adult get this size. Don't think about trying to get a smartphone or any cell phone in this fanny pack. I struggled just to get my keys, travel sized hand sanitizer and 3 oz travel sized lotion in the main compartment. In the small compartment below, the only item I could get in was lip ointment."
1,Dissapointed,"This used to be a superior product to the generic I have tried. Now I am beginning to think Kotex is cutting corners, it behaves the same as inferior generic products, splitting seams, cotton falling out, same reaction from inferior products. Are they using the same company as the generics that fell apart? It has happened more than once, in fact happens often, inferior just like those I chose not to buy any more and purchased ""Kotex."" But don't fool me, you have changed, it's not the same anymore. You ruined your product. I would suggest Always, their product has not gone inferior. I'm dissapointed in Kotex, shame on you.Don't buy it anymore, subtle, but it's getting worse."
3,Babe,"Product to use during the heaviest days but not overnight. The pad is not long enough, the wings are too small. Two pads in the panty are needed to not wake up during the night..."
4,Skip K.,"I used to use these on a regular basis,to contain a bowel problem..They just couldn't retain the fluid that well,I switched to Always ""Ultra"", what a difference,pad stays in place,no bunching up,and it really absorbs...best of all it helps to control odor an thats a plus...good product,but the Always is better.."
4,Beyond Recycling-review,"This is an excellent resource for anyone interested in going a step further than just recycling. Organized by products, she gives valuable information about alternatives to many everyday products plus some new uses, as well as names of companies that make, use or process recyclables."
5,An all-around excellent loafer/dress-casual shoe.,"I was lucky enough to win a new pair of these loafers at an Ebay auction for $28.00 and am very pleased with them. While they cannot be considered ""dress"" shoes they do serve well as dress-casual shoes and pair out well with dress slacks and long-sleeve dress shirts for a casual and relaxed yet semi-formal look. At less than $60.00 suggested retail price these easily rival and outclass other (more expensive) shoes from other brands."
3,Egh...,"I generally enjoy the genre of this book, so when I saw it on clearance for $2 at the local book store I decided to give it a try. I felt the story was alright but the writing was... not great.I don't mean to sound too critical (and I haven't read any of the author's other books) but I found the writing to be almost to ""by the book"". I noticed at the beginning she used a lot of analogies to describe things and in general way too many product references, such as (not actual quote) ""They were eating Doritos while X played XBox and Y read People Magazine"".I guess I just found the writing to be something I would expect from a school assignment where the teacher had a list of writing skills she wanted the students to incorporate into the story. BUT I gave the story 3 stars because I did read the whole thing in about 2 days and didn't feel like I wasted my time."
2,Did I read the same book,"To be honest I am surprised at the high rating this book seemed to have received from all the readers so far. I love chick-lit, the funnier the better, but this book felt a little flat for me. What is odd is I cannot pin point what I did not like about the book, I just really struggled to get into the story, and really struggled just to finish it. I think my main problem was I was expecting it to be a 5-star book, and it really was only a 3 1/2....however, since I was so disappointed, it felt like a 2-star book. Maybe if I hadn't had such high expectations I would have enjoyed it some what better."
3,Attractive compilation from Opera Rara's back catalogue,"I haven't seen this CD although I have heard excerpts of several of the operas sampled on this compilation and those I have heard are up to the usual high Opera Rara standard. Not super-starry but usually reliably musical in recovering neglected works. And this is an attractive collection of highlights. Unfortunately the reason I haven't bought it is because I assume that, like most if not all of Opera Rara's compilation discs, the texts and translations have been cut. Maybe the next reviewer could clarify?"
5,best workout ever!,I have been searching for this workout tape for a long time and prefer the ones with bessie in them even though the other girls were great! I would love it if i could get a response telling me of how i can get a hold of one of these tapes! And the workouts really do work! Workouts like these make it enjoyable to stay in shape!
5,BEST WORKOUT EVER,"I, too, was doing these exercises in junior high school. I thought the ladies were so pretty, and the exercises were fun to do! I remember staying toned while I was doing them on a daily basis. I remember calling my cousins and asking them if they saw this great new exercise show on channel 23 in the mornings before school. We all were hooked!! (4 more, and 3 more, 2 more, and 8 MORE TIMES!) This was all before I had the luxury of owning a VCR of my own, so I was at the mercy of TV land. When it went off air, I sulked for what seemed like ever!!!! But, now I have fortunately regained a copy of four of them, and I must say that I am throwing away my Pilates DVDs and my Taebo! The exercises on 20 Minute Workout are easier on the limbs, do not require ballet dancer type limber, and won't ""bulk"" my muscles out like Taebo. They're fun to do and you basically forget you're exercising. I'm SOOOOO glad I have 20 Minute Workout in my life again! I'll never let them go!"
5,great to keep in shape,I first started using the 20 minute workout to lose my after pregnancy fat...22 years ago! I am now in my 50s (ouch) and I use the workout to stay in shape. I will do two workouts back to back if I want to slim down for a special vacation or if I start losing the battle of weight gain. I would recommend this workout for all ages. I would like to see it on TV again.
5,A Must for DVD,I think the 20 Minute workout features all women. This should be made on DVD and Blu-Ray. Try adding a maximum of 5 pound ankle and hand weights for better results.
2,Old,"I have been a long-time Slayer fan, since the Reign in Blood days, and this DVD depressed me. They are showing their age, most glaringly Tom Araya whose voice is so shot it makes me wonder how they saw fit to release this. Musically their performance is fine, the mix is impressive, and the production is flawless - except for the frequency of the close-ups that show how old these guys really are. Ultimately the strain in Tom's voice takes away from the whole show - it is painful to hear and it certainly looks like he is struggling to even get it out. Long live Slayer, but stop beating a dead-horse."
2,BAD,"Welll i just recently purchased this DVD. If youire a slayer fan, you'll like it. If your not, watching this aint gonna change your opinion.I am not a big slayer fan and even less after watching this DVD.The truth is these guys sound great on the records but they dont come off as well on stage. They just stand and play like idiotsI wish this DVD came without the fansrule section. Its awful.Even Tom and Jeff speak total [nonsense]......they really need to grow up......the F word is like used so often, you can tell its deliberate. Like theyre using the word just to impress their ""extremely immature"" audience."
3,It was a great show,"I know I was there for this one. Of course I can't speak to the quality of the DVD as it's not yet available, so only 3 stars. Would like to see myself on dvd in the pit. Tom Araya was quite nostalgic that night (Pearl Harbor day 2001)about the shows the had played in San Francisco in the early 80's. There was a kind of feel good aura in the air (NOT typical of Slayer, but it was still great). Slayer came back a few months later and played the Warfield again with Dave Lombardo on drums, but at this show Paul Bostaph was still with them. He left because of an arthritic hand (I think, I remember meeting Paul in the late 80's when he was with Forbidden, coolest guy on Earth). Maybe the delay in release will allow them a chance to add some cool stuff, like some live early footage or interviews, or pictures of people getting tortured or something."
1,Tired of Slayer,"Until some year ago I enjoyed Slayer. Now, I''m just tired of them, with their negative attitude, his sad lyrics, the ludicrous solos by Hanneman and King, the bad vocals by Araya. At least The Master (Dave Lombardo) is back on drums. Man, this guy can play!"
1,BLergh,"""UUuh, my name is Tom Araya! Look how bad, stupid and mean we are! Also, I recommend you all to use drugs like us! Bleee!""This is Slayer. That's all you'll get with this DVD."
4,All but the fan section. GREAT!!!,This is the first time that i have seen Slayer in a live performance. They are awesome just like everyone says. They put on one hell of a show. The sound in this dvd is good although i thought toward the end Tom sounded like he was tired. The only part of this dvd i didnt like was the fans rule section. A bunch of mosh brained teenagers that acted like a bunch of morons. I do hope Slayer included this as a joke because it was. I'm 31 years old and i listen to Slayer and the music does not make me act like that. I like Slayer but i dont worship them and think i have to act like an idiot to prove it.
3,"GREAT live dvd, but...","While I absolutely love the live concert part of this dvd, there is a section called ""fans rule"" that you can watch. This is why i only gave it 3 stars. It shows just how [messed] up some of slayers fans are. Everything from killing dogs in the name of satan to having sex with dead people is mentioned. I'm sorry but thats just sick. These fans need to get some serious help. So thats the only reason why I didnt give the dvd 5 stars."
2,Old,"I am a long-time Slayer fan and this DVD is rather depressing to me. Tom Araya's voice is so shot it detracts from the entire show. Musical performance, production, sound, etc - excellent. But Tom is too old, or strained to pull off any of the material - it is sad and causes me to question why they would release something that so obviously shows their age. Long live Slayer...But stop beating the horse."
1,Tom Araya's voice is shot,"Araya's voice is totally shot. He was gone by the third song, and the rest of the singing on the DVD is overdubs. Avoid this badly done DVD. Get Live Intrusion instead."
3,Great band... but DVD falls a little flat...,"In my eyes, Slayer has been the band who defined Metal and made it what it is today, and seeing them live is the most incredible thing ever... atleast it was 7 years ago. In this DVD they play the songs flawlessly but they seem to get tired out a little to fast. Kerry King is definately NOT in his prime during this DVD. And the Fans Rule section was totally just not needed and also brought the DVD down a bit... I'm sorry to downgrade something by Slayer like this since everything else I've owned from Slayer I've given 5 stars too but this DVD just wasn't satisfying enough for me."
4,Rigth attitude but Slayer members look tired at this point,"Slayer will always be Slayer But this guys are not anymore the same that were 20 years ago , age has come and part of that 80s magic is gone , the touch is lost , maybe is possible to recover that , but how to know what takes to achieve that?, that is the question, Slayer are definitely the kings, because no other band has been able to play like this guys , even in this days younger bands cant be as heavy as this legend in present time, (in past time of course never would be compared even), but time cant be stoped , maybe Slayer should call it a day soon to remain as the kings forever, after all they deserve itHM"
3,"Hold on, now","I bought this under the impression that Dave Lombardo would be drumming (clever how they didn't mention the band members until you've purchased it and look inside...). All in all, it's an average performance, other than Tom's voice turning to pure sh*t after maybe 5 songs, and it's painfully obvious Paul Bostaph doesn't want to be there. I give it 3 stars when I really think it deserved 2, but they get an extra point for not selling out, which means they have about 20 songs here that sound EXACTLY THE SAME.... I've seen them live before (in '96 and again in'99) and was not impressed, and again, I just wanted to see Dave drumming, which was another disappointment. When the hell is Sepultura gonna do a new live DVD? Now that's a metal band that keeps things interesting."
4,AWESOME CONCERT,"this dvd is f'n great, i couldnt however give it 5 stars due to:1- there arent enough songs from diabolus in musica or divine intervention, too many off god hates us all2- the documentry has the most clueless and stupid people doing the interviews, ruins the experience"
1,This DVD [stinks]!,Tom Araya's voice is shot. It gives out at the middle only to be replaced by overdubs. Don't get this ... DVD.
3,Slayer Kicks Ass!,"The show itself is great on this dvd, but the interviews with fans and morons between alot of the songs not only take away from the intensity of the show and Slayer but the interviewer is real jackass as well - I guess the guy didn't even like Slayer so everything he said came across as condescending towards the people and the music. Slayer should have had that crap taken out or put it in the bonus section so you don't have to see it during the show. Still Reigning is hands down much better than this dvd, this is still worth having for a cheap price."
2,Ehh,"I've been a Slayer fan for a number of years now, and I love the music. However, this DVD stirred a sense of distaste for Slayer in me which I had to wash clean with some good old Reign in Blood. The footage of the concert was ok, and the video for bloodline is cool to have. However, the fans rule section was basically a random collection of 15-18 year old teenagers venting the old ""I hate my father/mother/religious leader/principal/boss/other figure of authority"". If you're a Slayer fan who needs to have everything that Slayer has ever produced, then feel free to get it. However, if you're new to Slayer or don't care for the aforementioned teen angst, get the older video that Slayer released right after Divine Intervention, it's more interesting."
4,"War at the Warfield ok, but Still Reigning is perfection","I first bought War at the Warfield in August of 2003. At the time, it was my first live Slayer video purchase. I fell in love with the band upon first viewing and thought it was the best metal DVD ever. But after a couple of months, I lost interest in viewing it because the live performance seemed uneven in places. For example, the opening number Disciple has a machine gun-style blitz beginning which Slayer has never done again. Dittohead also has a kind of compressed explosive feel which gives the song an unnatural sound. A year later, I bought Reign In Blood Live: Still Reigning and my love for Slayer has been more than reaffirmed. Tom's voice sounds more powerful and Slayer even plays with more energy. I guess this proves that Slayer is an their very best live when performing their best material, Reign In Blood of course. War at the Warfield is a good Slayer DVD, but Still Reigning is superior."
1,Cheap and do not cut!,"These knives do not cut. I am a 23 year old male and I'm telling you that I would rather use a butter knife to cut steak, fruit etc. Buy a more expensive pair because I ended up just throwing them away."
1,250MG of salt and 13 grams of sugar????,Holy poop!! wish I would have checked that before I ordered them!! How exactly does adding 13 grams of sugar help your blood sugar level?? I checked that AFTER I tasted one because they taste like what I would imagine heavily salted wood chips to taste like!! What a hoax!!! I am found this HEALYH FOOD to be counter productive to blood sugar and high blood pressure..I threw them out!!!
1,Stale,"The product arrived on time but was stale. I have purchased this product from Kashi at other times and it just did not meet the standard. It is not close to the expiration date, but I almost lost a tooth trying to eat it. Good product, but it is not a good idea to purchase it through Amazon."
2,bit tough,These were a little more difficult to eat than I expected. They are bulky which is good but some of the grain is a little tough. They are somewhat tasty but I'm looking for a better product than this.
5,Great snack bar,"I have a really hard time finding a snack bar that I can enjoy and be good for me. This has to be one of Kashi's best products (although I've only found one Kashi product I can't even stand the flavor of). The chocolate doesn't taste fake, and the almond is not overpowering at all. The flavors blend in together very well with the brown rice. Great flavor, great bar!"
4,Great Bar but pricey,"I really like these bars and have been buying them at the grocery store for a while. I figured that since I was eating so many of them, I should order here to save money. WRONG. They are much cheaper to buy individually at my local grocery store. I was very surprised by that as I thought I would save money by buying in bulk. Too bad."
4,kashi go lean,My husband and I have used this product for a few years. Not only is it a tasty and convenient breakfast bar but our doctors and nutritionist have recommended it as well. Works particuarly well when eaten before exercise because it is easily digested and provides steady flow of energy for a couple of years
4,Very tasty and filling,"I love bringing these to work for a snack. Of the Kashi Go Lean! snacks, this flavor is my favorite. They're filling and satisfy both salt & sugar cravings, and I feel satisfied for a long time. Yum!"
3,Poorly Put Together,The coverage and information in the study section of this book was useful and up to date. However I found too many errors in the practice test answer sheet and in the explanation to the answers. Some questions in the test didn't match up with the questions in the answer sheet or the explanations and some were swapped. It made figuring out my grade on my practice tests more difficult then it had to be.
5,Great experience all around!,Product arrived on time and was in great condition! I will definitely purchase from this company again.
5,I love this Book!,Hi...my name is taylor I am 7 years old and going into 1st grade. This is by far the best book that I have ever read in my entire life. I highly recommend this book to children around the world.
5,Lots of Fun for our Toddler,"Our boy Alex loves this book, even at a year and a half old. He frequently picks it out of a stack of books and brings it to us to read to him. We spend a lot of time on each page so that he can find the snake's head. The pictures are beautifully colored and filled with lots of curious details. It is one of the few books that keep him so interested that he often wants us to go through it several times each sitting. I highly recommend this book."
5,An excellent book with beautiful art work,"Easy enough for the youngest children, this book also provides a nice challenge for older toddlers and preschoolers to find where the snake is hiding. The rhymes make it easy to read and are good practice for little ears. The artwork is interesting and quite detailed. My son, now 3, has had his copy since he was a baby and still loves it."
3,Not that interesting but my daughter loves it,"This is a pretty book with nice illustrations and short, easy rhymes. I don't think it's that interesting but when I returned a copy to the library I noticed that my 16 month-old daughter kept asking for the ""snake"" book so I'm going to buy a copy. The illustrations have very similar colors on every page so I think it's a little difficult for kids under two to pick out what's pictured, but as I said, my daughter likes it."
1,"Small, messy and doesn't hold a full clove","I used this garlic press over the holidays at my sister's. I'm buying her a new one because of how poorly it performed, I won't let her live like that. First the press basket is tiny, I needed to cut cloves in half to press. Second the baskets and press dont fit snugly so a lot of the garlic just came up the sides making a big mess. Finally cleaning is simply not that easy as your balancing little pieces and still need to clean the main unit since the garlic smeared all over the sides. To me a good garlic press lets you load it with 3+ plus cloves, press, get a tbsp+ of garlic, use an attached cleaner to push out the skin, run it under water and hang it to dry, your fingers stay clean, your garlic is pressed and your meal is tasty."
4,"Double the handles, double the fun!","I love this! It's one of the most useful gadgets in my kitchen. I've found I can also use it for squeezing tea bags as well. Wonderful value for money, robust, chunky, dishwasher and microwave proof, my Wusthof garlic press is the envy of my all friends, and the talk of the Women's Institute Coffee Mornings. The handles are a great length, as well, and made from wipe clean soft rubber. I'm buying everyone I know one this Christmas!"
4,Something special from Nena,"For what amounts to full price you get the same song performed four different ways. But you would be ready for that if you're aware that this is a CD single. And it is by NENA and is an import that I would never have hoped to run across except on Amazon.com. I hope others have a chance to see the film the material comes from. I cannot say that (and the logical thing would be to consider this a souvenir of having viewed the film), but this was truly a valuable disc to have because it is Nena singing a lovely song. First the ""radio version"" (which is with strings and a little bit of rhythm accompaniment. Then an acoustic accompaniment. An accompaniment with strings in a ""classical"" version. Then just a string arrangement without Nena. Four stars, but that is not criticism in any way. I wish I had a hundred more Nena discs like this."
4,There is a life lesson here,"This book was inspirational to me. Through his revealing story, Terry gives us a life lesson in overcoming adversity, judging others and faith in God. As I read the book, I found myself going through the range of emotions: sadness, triumph, joy, compassion and hope. This book is not only a self-help guide for those suffering disfigurement, but a necessary examination of what is needed in life to succeed. I will be using many of these lessons in my daily life."
5,Helping Us Face Ourselves,"Terry writes a book that encourages all of us to evaluate how we look at ourselves and the world around us. The book takes us to college times with the raw emotions of a young man and layers the numerous trying issues created by dysfiguring cancer.A fast, compelling read."
4,Children love this story.,"Author Mike Gibbie uses repetition to build up his story of a dog who loses his memory. He can't remember what he likes to eat, if he has fleas, if his nose is pink or if he likes splashing in puddles. Each dog he meets he asks if they know his name or anything about him. He encounters Alf the Alsation, Charlie the Chihuahua, Bobby the Bulldog and many more on his journey to rediscovering himself. Illustrator Barbara Nascimbeni's artwork is simple yet filled with color and wonder. She uses big features, specific details and makes use of the entire page. This is a cute book to read to a child. Half way through the story, you wonder what will happen next and who else will help him."
2,For completists only,"This one is deadly. My sister (who likes new Who and is somewhat familiar with Pertwee & T. Baker stuff) bought it for the K-9 angle. I hadn't seen it for many years but I had moderately positive memories. We watched it for about 30 minutes then switched off. It was excruciating. This mess was a huge nosedive from the previous storyDoctor Who: Horror of Fang Rock (Story 92). This was the beginning of the Graham Williams years as producer and it shows. The story gets a little better towards the end but it's painful getting there. AVOID.K-9 & Company isn't much but it is better than 'The Invisible Enemy'. Not enough, however, to warrant the price."
2,"Thought provoking, but hard to swallow...","Unlike the review that Modern Berean gave, I don't think the book was total trash. It does indeed make a person go, ""What?"" a lot of the time, but, there are some definite truths to what Mr. Smith wrote.It did take me a while to warm up to his writing style. I'm sure that has to do with the fact that he's a lawyer. Its also difficult to understand exactly what he personally believes.His attempt to give an overview of Christianity for non-believers and believers both, leaves you scracthing your head at some of his conclusions. While I agree with him that we (as Christians) should take a HUGE step back from our belief systems and take a fresh look at the Jesus we think we know, I'm not sure that abandoning whole parts of the Bible is how to begin.All in all, I wouldn't recommend buying the book. Go to your library and check it out."
3,Sherpa Ultimate Pet Carrier on Wheels,"Received the bag, set it up, and found that the ends of the bag literally drag on the floor. After much local searching, I located the same bag in stores and most have the same issue of the bag ends being much lower than the travel sectiion where the pet is. When the pet is inside, it causes more weight to be put onto the bag center, and with the ends being lower, this creates drag and ultimately stops the bag from rolling. My dog is 12 pounds and if you pull the bag a bit too fast, it will tip over. We practiced using the bag on my tile floors as we have a long tiled main level; it didn't take long for the bag to tip over if we turned a corner, moved too quickly, or if the dog shifted around at all--typical things you would encounter in an airport. This model seems to have a manufacturing issue with the way the ends are created. To work best the ends should be the same level as the middle section so the wheels work smoothly."
4,"Well made, but...","I've used the non-wheeled Sherpa bags for years and years. They have worked well and I've never had a problem with them. I did, however, have a problem carrying my dachshund in the bag all through the airport. It hurt my back.I bought two large wheeled models and sent them back, they seemed way too large to go under a seat. The wheeled mediums are a perfect size for our eleven and fourteen pound dogs. I'm about to take them on a flight and expect no problems, but will update if I do.My issue is the carriers smell like really cheap plastic. If it bothers our noses, it must bother the dog's. I've been airing them out for a week and they still have an odor. I would think the manufacturer used a cheaper plastic this time around.CB"
3,OFF-Wheels,"No matter how small the pet or how slow you walk it has a tendency to just flip over onto it's side. If it would stay straight up it's wonderful. Easy to use, light-weight, privacy flaps all around, extra doors, roomy and comfortable. My dog loves to just jump inside and sit or sleep (like her own private den) but, only as long as the wheels are off."
3,sherpa carrier,"well made, but really too small for most of our cats. our most docile cat was ok, but the others seemed to get frantic. one even broke out through the zippers while in the car."
5,LOVE IT,Adorable addition to our doll house. We have had this product the for over a year and it's still a hit with my 3 and 4 year old. The just LOVE those little animals and bowls!
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed. I ordered a dollhouse and wanted this to go along with it. The items are tiny!
4,Fun pet set,"Great pet set for play. Got my son a wooden playhouse and this item goes perfectly with it. Honestly, when I purchased I didn't even notice there was a cat and bunny that came with it. Nice surprise when I opened box. Kind of like a bonus. :)"
5,Great product!,This house is very versatile and gender neutral so it is an ideal toy to use in my work with children. Easy to set up and looks very durable and safe for ages 3 and up.
1,worst sandals,"I bought these sandals on the reviews of other customers and regret it. These are the worst ,most uncomfortable sandals. Very cheaply made in China.Quality is unacceptable and completely waste of money. I wonder if some of these reviews are written by the company itself."
5,The best single I have ever bought,"I have 500 records, and this is the best single I have ever bought - I actually got two in case one gets a scratch. My friend Jim came over in the very late afternoon and put this in my CD player. It was a grey day in Scotland and by the time the disc was over it was dark out. Neither of us had moved the entire 28 minutes; it blew my mind. Absolutely stunning. I think back to that year every time I hear it - but unlike many discs from the time which I listen to out of nostalgia, I genuinely love this record as much today as I did then. It will be the best 5 bucks you spend this month, believe me."
1,Touched on the drama of verbally accusing your assailant/abuser,"page#243, page#234, page#86, page#258 were useful.Remembering and healing the effects of traumaThis book seems to touch on the overall basics of counseling the abused and not abused but merely slighted patients in the counseling arena. Or they may suffer from some other illness and seeking attention from the psychologist during a family spat. Not insightful."
2,What's in it for you?,"This is anything but an even-handed approach to the issue of trauma, particularly in the case of repressed memories of childhood sexual abuse. The principle reason I have given it more than one star is the fact that while the author ignores one side of the debate (except for the purposes of setting up a what Logic 101 would term a ""straw man"") he does quite well in covering the bases (and more) on his own side. Were one to this book in conjunction with another, the arguments of which were equally biased yet well stated, one might have a decent basis on which to form an opinion. A good example of a similar pairing might be to read Lenore Terr's ""Unchained Memories: True Stories of Traumatic Memories, Lost and Found"" along with Elizabeth Loftus' ""The Myth of Repressed Memory."" Neither are quite as unbalanced as this particular work but perhaps this may lend them more credibility."
3,Meh,I was really looking forward to this DVD but it turned out to be less than exciting for me personally. I own many bellydance DVDs and this one just isn't a favorite for me. I don't like the way she instructs as it isn't as clear as some other BD instructors. I would not recommend for beginners. It is nice to add a little variety to your shimmies but that's about it.
4,Basic instructions,"Actually a pretty good video for begining through advanced, not better than most of the belly daning videos I have not worse about avarage."
1,Chillzanne Bowl Not Worth the Money!,I bought my bowl a few years ago. I took it out to use this weekend and found out the gel is all hardened in the bowl. It doesn't chill anymore. I had stored mine in the freezer as suggested by the Pampered Chef hostess. I called my sister to tell her about it and she had the same thing happen. Don't waste your money!
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Save your money, don't throw ir away on this piece of trash. Kenny is a undertalented, overrated bald-headed little guy that got lucky. He cashed in on this island theme and thinks he is the Jimmy Buffet of country music when all he really is a artist with no talent."
4,Short But Sweet,This video collection by Kenny Chesney contains only six songs but is still good value for the price.I also have the Kenny Chesney Greatest Hits video collection and the songs on this are all different to the When The Sun Goes Down collection.The sound and vision quality is very good on the When The Sun Goes Down collection. Recommended particularly at this price.
2,# of songs,I am ok with the quality of the dvd and service I received. I am not happy with the size of the dvd. You need to post the number of songs that are on the dvd I was under the impression that it had the same number of songs as the cd with the same name.
5,"Great DVD for any Kenny Fan, BUT.....................","This is a great DVD, and all the songs are Good. BUT I was confused when I saw the title, ""When The Sun Goes Down"", and later found that THE MUSIC VIDEO, ""WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN"" with UNCLE KRACKER, WAS NOT PRESENT on this DVD. Even though I was disappointed, I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS DVD TO ANYONE."
3,"Bad name, THIS SONG isn't on the DVD","What's wrong with people who have a song with this name, then release a DVD with this name but don't put the song on it? He's good, the songs are good, but its BS when they do something like this"
5,REAL LIFE,"Real Life is the kind of album that makes you think and wonder about it days after the last time you heard it, and makes you kick yourself when you want to hear it right now all the way through and you can't find the cd in your car, or when you realize you haven't uploaded it onto your ipod yet (what?! impossible!). . . There isn't an artist that sounds close, or even close enough to stand in for joan's honest and effortless voice soaring through a mood, liberated from any pedestrian linear storytelling, intimate and timeless. Real Life is the kind of album that you have to listen to at least twice, and after that, it's like a great movie that keeps giving you something new every time you watch it. I thought I'd make comparisons: she's like Laura Nyro-cross-PJHarvey-cross-Chrissy Hines-cross-Nick Drake (the Pink Moon album) -- but it feels lame to me, probably because none of it is really true. It's an either-you-get-it-or-you-don't album -- if you're reading this, get it :)."
5,Great Music,"If you like CDs by people such as Roisin Murphy, Imogen Heap, Cat Power, then you'll probably end up declaring this one of your favourite CDs of 2007."
4,Exceptional,This is an exeptional song. I like it beacuse it is different then most of the songs in the US. The Romanian group o-zone adds a good beat in this song. The voices are also very good and it is very catchy. I would recommend this to a dancer or anybody that likes a catchy rythym or wants to try something new.
1,Not HP Product,"I ordered as it came up as an HP product. Beware-it is a refilled cartridge, and Amazon will charge you for returning it."
2,Sony Universal Remote,"This Remote is not what I expected and I no longer use it. The display is dim, it's complicated to program and difficult to use. It's probably smarter than me, maybe that's the problem. It's 100 dollars I could have put to better use."
1,Don't Waste Your Time & Money!,"What a piece of junk! I have owned all SONY gear for more than 20 years and thought SONY and SONY ES AV equipment was very good. I upgraded to a 50"" plasma in the last year and new 7.1 receiver and 400 disk DVD. I also decided to upgrade my remotes and go to an universal, one remote does it all. Naturally I leaned toward the SONY and bought the RM-AV3100. Unfortunately, I have finally run into something that SONY makes that is worthless! None of my SONY equipment would work and the instructions in the manual instruct you to do one thing and it's like the remote and the manual are not for the same model. It took more than 30 minutes to set the clock! After deleting the preset button's info, it would finally accept a new code.SONY customer service could only refer me back to the manual.I consider myself somewhat electronics literate but this remote is more than I can handle. I'll stay with my 4 separate remotes.PLEASE buy something else!"
1,An ugly paperweight.....and nothing more.,"Given Sony's general care in ensuring functionality of their items prior to release, I had really high hopes for the AV3100 as the solution to the ""too many remotes"" problem, and paid seriously big bucks for it. Wrong. This item is a real clunker in every sense of the word. Oversized and hard to handle. Serious flaws have been well-described and documented in other reviews. In particular, the touch screen has very low contrast and poor angle of readability, and the component-select buttons for DVD/AMP/VCR/etc are not back-lit, making it essentially impossible to use in low-light conditions. It's significant that Crutchfield.com has dropped it from their extensive selection of remotes. Simply way way below Sony standards. Not worth it at any price, even the low prices at which it is currently being remaindered."
1,Broke after three months,This remote worked fine until shortly after three months from purchase. One day it simply stopped working without warning. I've changed batteries and still it will not operate. Stay away from this product.
2,Disapointed,"I should have researched this remote better, but being a BIG Sony fan I trusted in their description. This remote is a nightmare to program! The manual is complicated and hard to understand, and online support is not much help.The screen freezes while programming, it's hard to clear and it's complicated to use.Figure I'll try it for a month If my wife can't use it I'll be selling it on EBay!"
3,Almost there,"I bought this remote despite what I had read concerning setup, etc... Most of my components are Sony so I assumed that it would be a slam dunk as far as programming. The remote is supposed to be pre-programmed for all Sony products. It did not however control my Sony receiver (985). It was easy to have the 3100 learn the commands if you have your original remote.I was disappointed that I had to program it for my PVR. You would think in this day and age the codes would be out there.I did eventually get the remote to control all of my components, but ran out of patience trying to get the system control macros to control the misc functions.I recently purchased the Logitech 659. It really is a much easier product to program and adjust. I would take a look at it before purchasing the Sony."
3,Trying to be alternative,"Natalie's comeback single (from the ""White Lillies Island"" album) tries to be different from her biggest hit Torn, that's true. It just doesn't seem to make sense, it's like a series of thoughts put together in a song, hard to find a structure there."
3,Nepal (country guide),This book gave a good review of the sites that would be visited. I felt that I had a fair idea of what it would be like. The health information was helpful in preparing for the trip. It was detailed enough to help obtain the correct water purification products. It gave some very helpful information about trekking which I used to great advantage.
3,Solid book,"Good overall coverage of the region. Listed all major activities from rafting, hiking, driving, or whatever. I would recommend it for people traveling there. I wish it would have gone into detail about the tour operators."
1,Very cheap,"I plugged it in for the first time, it didn't work, then when I went to unplug it, it fell apart. I would not recommend it."
4,Great one-volume source,"John E. Morby's book is a brief (254 pages) introduction to the royal dynasties of the world, past and present, presented geographically, in tabluar format. Not only does it include the major ruling houses (e.g., England), it also gives information on the minor ones (e.g. Wuerttemburg, Brunswick, etc.).While the non-European dynasties are covered less comprehensively (the individual Emirs of the United Arab Emirates, for example, are omitted), on the whole this is an excellent resource for historians, researchers, members of the media, or anyone who'd like a quick rundown of names, places, and dates. Even the Aztecs and Incas have coverage here!One hopes that this book will be available once again, or better still an even more comprehensive replacement!"
3,"John E. Morby: ""Dynasties of the World""","It is an impressive lot of ""Rulers"" in most of the worlds dynasties.But why don't Morby tell about the Spouses?This book would have been even more usefull if you could see about the families - mostly the female parts - as well.Dynasties of the World: A Chronological and Genealogical Handbook (Oxford Paperback Reference)"
2,Ridiculous from korean point of view,"As a korean, I'm quite disappointed with the book. While japanese line was delved pretty minutely and far back, korean line was just ridiculous. Korean's history isn't shorter than japanese and it might be even longer. Japan actually was quite benefited from korean kingdoms for a long long time, since B.C. ** till Chosun dynasty. And the author listed 'just' Chosun dynasty that started about 1392. Just ridiculous."
1,Ridiculous regarding Korean dynasty,"From a korean point of view this book is quite ridiculous. While the author delved minutely andfar back into Japanese line, Korean line just starts at 1392, Chosun dynasty. Korean history isas long as japanese one and it even might be longer. Japanese was greatly benefited by koreankingdoms from B.C.*** to chosun dynasty(And how do they pay it? War..occupation..) Thisbook needs revision, at least for the korean line."
2,Pretty lame for a Cusick book,"I was very disappointed in this book. It was boring, twisting, and I didn't like the main character. If your gonna read a Cusick book read TRICK OR TREAT, VAMPIRE or FATAL SECRETS."
2,This was written by Price?,"After reading Price's newer novels based on crime and detective work, Ladies Man comes as a decidedly junior effort when comparing writing styles. The first half of the book was a bore sprinkled with a depressing story line. The second half marks a shift to a greater introspection into the character's lives, albiet still depressing. The ending is very abrupt. Quite possibly his worst novel."
2,where the hell is the end???,"Okay, aside from reading like a ""You know, this could be Holden Caulfield at 29"" script, the first 200 or so pages are pretty good. Readable, anyway. But the last bits just totally suck. no ending in sight, and in a way that doesn't necessarily seem intentional. i actually examined my copies spine to see if maybe the last chapter had been torn out or something. Skip this, skip this one big time."
1,very 1980s,"Richard Price is a good writer, and I really enjoyed Lush Life, but this novel is dated. It may have been good back in the '80s"
1,Anco 4358 Wiper Arm,"The wiper arm that I received was bent in such a way as to scrape and scratch the chrome at the bottom of the windshield.I had to modify the arm to make it fit properly.Not real satisfied.Thanks,Rick Langert"
1,Cheap bag,Do not recommend had bag for a week and I busted it open at the top of the seam its cheap.
1,Worst remaster ever,"This CD sounds awful!! No 'audiophile sound' (as one of the reviewers above stated) at all. It is by far the worst sounding remaster I have ever heard. In fact, I think it is no remaster at all, they just raised the volume, the mids and the lows. Sound stage is a mess, completely muddy. The original A&M; CD's sound better; more detail and clarity. I have meticulously compared this CD with the original ones on my super-stereo that I built myself and that reveals every detail, and on my electrostatic headphones. Only to come to the undoubted conclusion that this so called remaster is a scam! No wonder, it is from a completely obscure label Acadia/Evangeline.DO NOT BUY THIS!! You will be greatly disappointed.We can only wait and hope for A&M; itself to properly remaster these truly great albums (It should be possible, A&M; recordings are usually very good.)Too bad 0 stars wasn't an option..."
3,A SOLID BOOK WITH A TON OF FACTS,THIS IS ABOUT THE LONGEST HITTING STREAK IN MAJOR LEAGUE BASBALL HISTORY AND SOME OF THE EVENTS DURING 1941. THE AUTHOR GIVES US A GOOD LOOK AT EACH GAME DURING THE STREAK AND A GREAT DEAL OF DETAIL CONCERNING THE EVENTS LEADING TO WORLD WAR II. HE DOES A VERY GOOD JOB AND KEEPS MY INTERST WHEN HE STICKS TO THE STREAK AND WHAT DIMAG DID DURING EACH AT BAT. BUT HE ALSO INCLUDES TOO MUCH DETAIL ABOUT WORLD EVENTS WHICH BECOME TEDIOUS AND REPETITITVE. I RECOMMEND THIS FOR HISTORY BUFFS OF BASEBALL.
1,Big Disappointment,"Because I use a lot of this toner, I was glad to find a recycled product at less expense. However, after the first hundred pages, it placed four inch horizontal line marks on the copy paper at 4-inch intervals (about 3 lines per page), thus rendering it unuseable for a nice finished product. Back to the HP folks!"
2,A mediocre radio program,"This is a radio program of 1957, featuring Julie London, Jo Ann Greer, Stumpy Brown, and June Christy. The latter has a hard time keeping on the notes. Stumpy is...well...Les's brother. Julie London is okay, but nothing exceptional. The band sounds great, but its role is almost exclusively accompaniment. The chit chat between the selections is awful. Groucho's ""You Bet Your Life"" announcer, George Fenneman, has to read lines that must have embarassed him.In short: Not much."
5,An amazing film with heart and soul,Reverend Dr. Marilyn Sewell's documented journey of the last two years as the Unitarian Minister in Portland OR is truly amazing and heartfelt. I would highly recommend this film
4,Great Highlights From the Full Performance,This one's for you if you don't like listening to the full 2 1/2 hours on the double disc set.
1,Save Your $$$$$$!!!!!!!,"After I used this product to refill my cartridge, I had to clean the print nozzles every time I wanted to print. Eventually, theprinter nozzle cleaning didn't work and the cartridge was completely dysfunctional, even though it was full of ink."
2,Piece of Crap!!!!,I bought this thinking that I would save money. But using this is a pain. The tubes got stuck in the cartridge and in trying to pull them out I bent them. Do not buy this instead buy a cartridge.
3,Good but not as good as the first one!,"I rented this thinking it might be good as the first one and it's ok but the first one I really like the most. This one is about he takes a trip to Athens, Greece. He enjoys the trip but he gets lost and tries to find his family. The Greece theme is really annoying but it mostly has the the same score from the first one. The first Benji I think is great out of all three the other two is not as good but Benji is still a classic!"
2,Amazing material but lacking tabs!!!!,"Let me start by saying i have been a fan of YJM since the '80s and the playing on this dvd is impressive, but without ant sort of tabs or printed material this dvd is worthless. You are now forced to watch the dvd to HEAR the instructor tell you where to play on the neck, which is no small feat when dealing with 32nd notes!!! There isn't a single visual that shows you the scale/lick patterns used for the performances and the accent of the instructor is hard to follow at times. It is such a shame as i could really see myself spending the time required to learn this style of music but my previous experience with LL lessons has soured me in a big way."
3,Interesting but...,"...kinda dorky looking. Why not buy the economy pack including this thing, a pocket pen protector, and roll of adhesive tape for the middle of your eyeglasses. You'll be all set!"
5,Never have to use a Sharpie again!,"I'd never used CD disc labels before and now wonder why I waited so long. I'd thought about getting the latest LiteScribe technology but this works just fine! I'd read that the software was difficult to use, but found there was nothing difficult about it. What a difference it makes having a label for all the CD's I produce, no matter the content - no more Sharpie scribbled discs. It was especially nice using a photo from a recent trip as the background for the label we used on our Photoshop slide show. The SureThing labels are great as well and very easy to order online. 'Truly couldn't be happier and I'm not easily pleased."
5,i'm happy.,this item worked real good.the full face didn't work on my portable dvd player.i guess it made the disc unbalanced.
2,Maine Coon Cat tote,Was dissapointed in the size of the embroidery- Should have been larger as the bagis of a larger size.For the price just felt the quality of the bag was not there.
3,THIS CD IS ONE THAT MOST FANS CAN ENJOY,I HAVE SEVERAL DICK HAYMES CDS. THIS IS A MUST CD FOR DICKS' FANS . IT HAS A GOOD SELECTION OF OUR FAVORITE SONGS. DICKS' VOICE IS GOOD AND THE ORCHESTRA ARRANGEMTNS USED ARE ALSO GOOD. THIS WILL CD WILL NOT DISAPPOINT ANY FAN.
2,Don't drink it on an empty stomach,"I love white tea, I adore Harney and Sons. However this tea made me feel a little funky. Maybe it was the cardammon on an empty stomach, but I felt a little sick. This just was not the tea for me. I didn't like it.Harney and Sons sachets are realy loose tea in the convenience of a tea bag. Each tea bag can brew two cups of tea. Instructions for brewing each individual tea is on the tin."
4,Great period caberet music,"Liane's voice is wonderful and with that wonderful caberet style. The song selection is first rate. Overall, I enjoy the Austrian half a little bit better than the German half but it is all very good. The Boheme Bar Trio is fantastic. Herbert Seiter's piano playing is first rate. Some of the numbers are a bit more caberet and some are more jazz. It is a gem of a disc. For those wanting to own this disc, try the used section of Amazon. It is about $30 but worth it."
3,"Started OK, but faded fast","Nice price, but... I bought one as a test, and am glad I only bought the one. The cartridge started out perfectly fine, but since it's remanufactured, there's no telling exactly how much life is left in the recycled components. In the case of my test cartridge, not enough to provide a normal usable life. To the end, text printed OK, but graphics were terrible and an ugly blobby stripe started to get worse and worse at the right side of the page.For occasional use, or if you are lucky enough to have a printer dedicated to draft copies or internal reports that get printed, filed and never looked at again, this is fine. For final copies, correspondence or pictures, stick with new HP-branded cartridges."
1,Flying Noodle isn't that Great,"The products are ok, but my experience with the people who work at Flying Noodle is what truly turned me off. I would rather deal with local people who are honest and who can't hide behind their online anonymity. It's too bad, because there are so many Good internet companies out there. If you want more details, just ask me personally."
1,Problems with Copyright Protection,"Will only play in car and on home stereo. Can't play on laptop or import to S3. Consequently, I can't listen when traveling on a plane or at work. Very Lame."
5,Great tunes,Get Up Stand Up is an amazing hit on this album as is all the others. I really enjoy listening to it to start my day.
3,"Good concept, could be fun for 5+","Purchased for our 4 year old boy's birthday. Unfortunately this one was intermittent on the control so we will be returning it.The controls employ 2 thumb joy sticks, one controls the right side wheels and the other controls the left side wheels. This makes driving straight for younger users challenging.We only ran it in the living room and it did well crawling over blocks and other toys (when the signal made it to the receiver or the motors decided to work).Would have liked to seen bigger tires for better ground clearance.I would recommend this for 4.5 - 5 years+"
4,It is a fun car.,"It is fun car. However, when it get into the water, it sink down soon. It is not like what the video show. Also the plastic cover is cheaper than what picture shows."
5,tuff as a boy,This toy holds up to a 6 yr. old with no problems. It does go over all surfaces and takes all the bumps and crashes that are handed out. Good toy and good price. Amazon had the a better price than other sites I visited.
1,What a huge disappointment!,"We thought this car would be perfect for our 4 year old, but there were problems from the beginning. The battery compartment on the remote control did not stay closed (there was a rattle inside - probably a small internal piece had broken off). We taped the batteries in and thought we'd still give it a try. Unfortunately, the car did not operate correctly. It would move a few inches and then stall out and not move at all, regardless of how we moved the remote control levers. When it would move, it only made left turns. Not a lot of fun. We finally gave up and sent it back for a refund. I will say that the refund process was easy and quick, and we got all of our money back within a week."
1,Did anyone test these things in real conditions?,"I was pretty excited about finding these cars for my boys. That enthusiasm was quickly dampened when I discovered that two of the three Morphibians were on the same frequency so only two could play at one time. Secondly, the clearance between the wheels and chasis is so close that grit and dirt on the wheels will quickly bring all motion to a halt. They may be fine for indoor play but they don't work outside due to this design flaw. Caveat emptor."
2,"Great idea, poor execution","My niece loved the fact that this RC car was in the shape of a shark and that it could be used in water. She used it for about a week before it stopped working. The batteries get used up extremely quickly, so be prepared for that. The car also is not as all-terrain as advertised. It gets stuck fairly easily. It does float in water, but it is very hard to steer while in the water or even make it move. Be prepared and have something ready to fish it out of the water because it will not be able to climb out of anything by itself.The remote control is also hard to operate for small children. I was looking for something that my 4-year-old niece would be able to operate, but the way the controls are set up makes it hard to learn how to control it. Overall, I would not recommend this car at all. It is just not durable enough for the young children who would like its shape."
2,"Not waterproof, not durable","Water will enter and the ruin batteries. Also, the antennae on the car breaks off and the gears will start making an awful screeching noise as the car begs to be put out of its misery. All this within a month of normal usage."
3,Great Looking RC Car,"I bought this as a gift for my nephew who is a few years younger than the recommended age limit for this toy. He was impressed with the look, but not sure what to do with it. So I took a few minutes with the toy. It moves easily, but I found the controls a bit confusing when trying to get the car to move in a straight line. Otherwise, the toy works great, looks cool and will be super fun for my nephew when he gets a little older."
4,Morphibian Shark,I bought 2 of these a gator and a shark. they loved them both. my only gripe is that the antena on the cars need to be a little more sturdy. Antena kept coming out.
4,Love this toy!,"This is such a great toy! I have been very pleased with how well it runs, how easy it is for my son to use and overall just how cool it is. He loves that it really will climb over far more terrain than any other remote control vehicle we've ever had. And it seems really sturdy, which is good for a boy's toy!"
3,Umm...,"This toy is so noisy! But, everything else is great! It is a little slippery on my tile floors, but it works great on grass and carpet. It cannot take hills outside, but it can push through leaves, twigs, etc. It goes really fast, and it still is working, so I don't know why everybody else says it is horrible."
2,"Nearly impossible to drive, radio spotty","I would suggest you avoid this product. First, it is nearly impossible for a child to drive because of the counter-intuitive control. The left stick controls the left tires and the right stick the right tires. To move forward, you have to press both sticks up. To turn right, you need to pull the right stick BACKWARDS or press the left one FORWARDS or both. It's kind of like the way a tank drives. This setup is sufficiently complicated that both I and my son weren't having any fun playing with this. Straight driving is fine, but turns become completely silly wipeouts with no sense of actual control. Not fun. Second, the car seems to lose the signal randomly even with fresh batteries. It stutters as a result. This does not seem to depend on the range, it just happens right out of the box. So I have a concern about quality also. It otherwise appears to be durable and has a creative design, so it's too bad that it has such an awkward control system."
1,Terrible :(,"I bought this car for my 4 year old son for Christmas. He loved it but then there we problems. After the first time use it started to be glitchy (work sometimes then not others, or only work for moments at a time). So we returned it and had another one sent to us. The second one did the same. We returned that one too and got our money back. The only thing good about all this is amazon.com has a great return system, it was easy and free to return."
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this from my local pool shop because it can go in the water as well as on land, and I thought my 3-year-old would like it. I only bought it because it was 50% off, which should have been my first clue it would be a piece of junk that nobody wants. Second, it only goes a few feet before losing the radio signal from the transmitter...horrible. Third, the remote control buttons are the stupid right-only/left-only type, so it is almost impossible to make it go straight, and my 3 years old definitely can't figure that out. Fourth, it goes too slow in the water. Fifth, it's VERY noisy. And, finally, it's not water tight! After only a few minutes in the pool the battery compartment was flooded. So I returned it. Be warned, it's horrible."
4,fun,It's a funny toy. My son loves it. It's not for races but to climb things ans overcome challenges as a little portion of water and rocks.
2,Fun but can not go into water,Got this remote control toy for my 3 year old nephew for christmas. He enjoyed playing with it until he played with it during a shower and got water into it. This toy cannot get wet otherwise it will break.. now he just plays with it without the remote. Sadly.
4,Fun for Parents Too!,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter liked my 5 y/o's remote controlled pony airplane. For Christmas I decided to get her a remote controlled car. I was looking for something that was durable and would be easy for her to use. She LOVES this car! It took her about a week to figure out the controls, but now she is a pro at using it. Both girls like to be chased by the car in the house. We have hard wook floors and carpet and the car works great on both. I can't wait to see how it works outside in the summer.The one thing I recommend doing is buying rechargable batteries for it. It doesn't suck a lot of battery life, but it seems the rechargable ones last longer."
1,JUnk,I bought two of these for Christmas gifts and this one was dead on arrival. I sent them both back for a refund
3,Hard to maneuver,"This remote controlled car works fine but when its in the water, it is pretty hard to maneuver. I guess its because it doesn't have a rudder to really help with steering."
2,Didn't work properly,We ordered two and one did not work about 1 hour after it was opened. Will be returning for a new car - hopefully with better luck
3,Using two Morphibians together/frequencies,"I have been looking for a set of remote cars that I could purchase for my twins. All of those we've tried so far run on the same frequency, so one remote works both cars, and one remote does nothing - very frustrating.We do not own these Morphibians yet (so please disregard rating - though it's worth 3 stars just that they have two frequencies!), but I did speak with Kid Galaxy customer service (very nice!) and she said they have 3 models that run on one frequency (27Mhz) and 2 models that run on another (49Mhz). So you just need to make sure you purchase models that run on different frequencies and then they'll operate independently.Gator = 27MhzKiller Whale = 27MhzRover = 27MhzShark = 49MhzExplorer = 49MhzJust thought this might be helpful to anyone else looking for two that can be played with together! I'll update the review once we receive them and have played with them!"
1,Very disappointed,Purchased this for my 6 year old son and he enjoyed it while it worked. Unfortunately the on/off switch broke in one day.I also purchased the Stingray and the movement is far slower than the shark. I don't know if it was designed that way or a defect. Very disappointed in make and durability and will not buy these series again.
2,Enjoy it while it lasts...until it breaks,"My son received this Christmas 2007. It has gotten use on and off, mostly off. So, it has not been heavily used. Just recently (Oct. 2008) the car wouldn't turn on anymore. Replaced the batteries but that did not solve the problem. I wound up taking the housing off the car and discovered there is a small plastic stem that goes from the on/off switch on the car into some kind of electric transistor gizmo. The stem itself had broken off, and I found it inside of the car when I opened it. It really isn't repairable, unless I could find a whole new switch piece (fat chance on finding that). At this price level, I think something like this should last longer than it did, considering it only got light-to-moderate usage. It was a pretty fun toy, but durability wasn't up to par."
2,Short Battery Life and Conflicting Frequecy Control,"Purchased the Land Shark and Cobra for my kids for Christmas. As they were out of school and driving me nuts, I let them open this present early. In one day I have gone through 12-AA batteries (car takes three each). Also, both cars run on the same frequency 49 Mhz. So one controller works both toys causing frustration between the kids. Kids love the toy but each car should be controlled independently and battery life should be improved."
1,had a faulty receiver or transmitter,"Its probably an ok toy but this one refused to move , or just in micro spurts.had to return for refund."
1,Didn't work,"Unfortunately, my car never worked. The remote control worked on another car that we had, but would not move the new one. Had to return it."
3,Pretty good for the money,"This is a pretty good toy for the money. The instinct to pull the toy out of the water by the antennae is a problem. Of course kids are going to do it but adults can't even fight the impulse. So that's kind of annoying because you have to re-thread the antennae back through the small ""straw"" that holds it upright.Also -- this should be obvious but don't put the remote control in the water! My 12 year old nephew didn't realize it... and I didn't know he had it in the pool until it was too late. Luckily, after 24 hours of drying out, it works again.So it seems like a durable little toy and fun too. I wouldn't pay a dime more for it though."
4,Fun RC for the Kids,"I bought two Morphibians and they both works great. I bought my son the Shark and my daughter the Killer whale. They both enjoy their cars and it is fun to run them together, they have not tried to run them in the water because we only have a pool to try this and I would not try to risk damaging them because of waves in the pool.The other problem I have with the RC car was it stated "" WORKING HEADLIGHTS"" on the Amazon site, but it does not have ANY working headlights just painted on headlights. MISLEADING !"
3,toy,this toy is fun and very durable but it is a little hard to operate for the little ones it took my son a while to figure out the controls
2,Too slow,"Was a disappointed, so was the kid I bought it for. It's not good with turns, VERY SLOW moving on land didn't try it yet on water. I wouldn't really recommend."
4,A better RC than most,"My 4 yr old grandson had played with the same RC and always loved it. I bought it for him to use in ""puddles"" but we have not taken it outside to puddles since it states it must be dried after use...not so easy for a 4 yr old! It is ""tougher"" than other RCs than I have bought."
3,Went well for a while,"This remote control car was fun while it lasted. Then one day, the wheels on one side would only go in reverse. Now it will only go in reverse or around in circles. Now useless."
3,Good RC,"This is a good RC for a toddler, it works well, is sturdy and the car is very water proof (upside down in sea water and not a drop got in) unfortunately the RC is not waterproof so it was game over when it was accidently dropped in the ocean pool :("
2,Needs Improved range,Basically the main problem I have with this is the RC range which is about 10-20ft. So what is the point if RC if the range is so bad. I would avoid this product unless you want to follow it around closely to use it.
3,Good while it lasts,"We bought this for our 18 month old (at the time) and he LOVED it, couldn't work the remote of course, he tried but didn't understand what to do. He liked just pushing it around and we had fun driving it while he chased it or it chased him. Only problem is a few months later the motor stopped working (not a battery issue, just a poor motor). This was after just two recharges of our batteries! Speaking of that, it lasts a LONG time per charge which suprised us. Other negatives is the antenna being a cheap ""string"" antenna that is really long and just hangs off, our son used this to carry it around by (he doesn't know any better). It would have been nice if they could have made it a fixed hard rubber antenna instead."
2,Needs more clearance,"We got two different varieties of this same toy for our 5-year old twins for Christmas. They were pretty excited and went to test them out before the wrapping paper ever hit the floor. They had fun inside on the wood floor, where the cars ran very well.However, once we got bundled and went outside to test the amphibious qualities of the cars we all soon realized that, despite being amphibious, they performed very poorly on uneven ground - same for the snow and the lake shore. Basically these cars have about 1/8 inch of clearance and get stuck on anything they drive over. Although they are marketed as amphibious, it only means that they are watertight; they CANNOT handle the slightest bit of topography. After the boys tried getting them to run on snow, soil and rocks a few times they gave up and started sledding.The boys still use them, but only in the house. If you want to get a functional outdoor R/C vehicle then this is NOT the car you are looking for."
1,A dud!!,My son who is 7 played with this ONCE!! We put it in the pool & it barely moved. It was a complete waste of money.
2,"Fun while it worked, which wasn't long.","My nephew absolutely loved this RC car until it completely stopped working. After a day or two it started sputtering until it eventually stopped responding altogether. Thinking maybe the batteries had died, I replaced them, but still no luck. Other reviews had told the same story, so I returned it and was sent a replacement. The new car is working well, but who knows how long this will last.Amazon's customer service was top notch, so this is most definitely only a review of the product."
4,Durable,"The kids love these. I got them for Christmas and they were easy riding, got good distance, and once they got the hang of the controls around the house and outside into the mud puddles it went!"
4,easy for small kids to operate,"we haven't tried water yet but easily drove in grass and up hills, our 5 year old grandson loves it!"
4,Durable and fun!,"It's a bit slow, and seems to go through batteries a little more frequently than anticipated. My 4yr old loves it though!"
4,Works...out of the water at least,"I bought it last christmas. It still works. I have not tried it in a water yet and don't think I plan to. Since it's 2 controller going same direction for each side of the wheel, it seems bit easier to control for younger kids. At the least it'll do a donut. Still works."
3,great until it breaks,This toy seemed fun until both wheels on the left side stopped spinning. Now it just goes around in a circle. Threw it away today.
2,"Decent truck, keep away from smaller children.","Feels good and solid when you open the package. The controls and vehicle don't have that ""cheap"" plastic feel, but it is a toy. The battery compartment is fairly hard to get in to, but I attribute that to the water tight feature.When this truck is on land it is quicker than expected for a vehicle designed for both water and land. In water it is harder to control and much slower but it does work. The truck did fill with water quickly when being splashed in the pool or is pulled under by smaller children. The antenna is the weak point and my 3yo picked the truck up by the antenna and it has not worked since.Overall it is a good toy for older children who can understand how to control it on both land and in water, and who know better than to submerge the truck and controller."
4,Fun Product,The grandkids love it and found it easier to control than the adults did. We did find that other electronics in the house may interfere with the functioning of the toy. Solution-----Don't use it in the house.
2,fun little toy for the week it worked,Got this for my 4 year old son for christmas and he liked it for the week it worked. After a week it the controller went to heck.I didnt want to waste a ton of cash for his first r.c. but I was retaught the lesson you get what you pay for...we got a piece of junk
4,great toy.. but it looks a tad bit different from the picture,"ordered this for my baby brother for his birthday, its a nice durable toy the only problem is that it doesnt look like as its shown in the picture but no matter my baby brother loved it"
2,"Sammy Davis, Jr. Singing at his Best - DISAPPOINTED!","First of all, THE FORMAT ON THIS DVD IS NOT IN ""COLOR"" AS STATED - but rather all in ""BLACK & WHITE""!!! The picture quality is fuzzy and the sound is not good. I appreciate Sammy Davis's many talents, and it was darling to see clips of him as a child star, however, this is not a quality film and it doesn't do him justice. I was disappointed with this DVD.It is a shame there isn't a better quality DVD available of Sammy in Color and in quality sound."
2,Pretty but Cheap Clasp,Very pretty but the clasp breaks all the time. Their bracelets or necklaces might be better as they see a little less wear and tear than an anklet. After it broke 5 times I gave up on this.
3,Worked for a while...,"Worked great for a while, but suddenly stopped being able to push the stick through the gun. Was very convenient and effective while it worked."
1,Black & Decker GG500S Disappoints,"I am really disappointed by the Black & Decker GG500S cordless glue gun. The trigger is much too hard to depress and the control of the glue is adversely affected by that function. It is very difficult to seat it into the heating stand and take it out with one hand (which I need to do for my work). It leaves strings of glue all over the place. For the price and the reputation of the brand, I would not recommend this glue gun."
2,Maybe I Received The Lemon?,"From Day 1, my gun doesn't push the glue stick through the unit. That is quite a problem. When I called B&D; they told me that I had to take the unit to a service center. I asked if this was a common problem--the answer: ""It is not unheard of.""The service center is not convenient to my travels so it sits. I have used it a couple times by pushing the glue stick through with a tooth pick but as you can imagine it is hard to control the project that way. It definitely gets hot, so use the same caution as you would a corded unit. It will be interesting to see if I can get it fixed."
4,Good gun.,"I received this gun for Christmas and have put it to use a few times. So far, I'm very impressed. I only wish the battery kept its charge longer."
2,Disappointment,The item portrayed was similiar to but not what I wanted. The picture was misleading and when delivered the glass pasta keeper was broken beyond repair.Efforts to get either Amazon or the shipper to respond failed and I wasted my money. i will never buy anything from Amazon again.
3,Just OK,"2/22/11: This product is ""Just OK"" Upon reciept the side view mirror was found to be very loose and the passenger side door wouldnt open. I was able to fix in under 10 minutes by dissassembling it and freeing up the door mechinism. The side view mirror and 1 of the tailpipes now sits in a drawer having since fallen off. Overall the product has a decent look and feels sturdy due to the diecast body. The improvements I would like to have seen are a fix for that sideview mirror and non-functional wiperblades (now on the verge of breaking off!) along with the licence plate numbering as all of the other standard graphics are there. I suggest you look around as better prices can be found on-line and though the original casting is made by ERTL expect to receive some manufacturer of the same product who bought rights when you receive yours."
5,"great value, my son loves it. Looked elsewhere for this product and the prices were higher , this price was great!!","Great product for the price, looked elsewhere and it cost higher, this is great value."
2,Not really worth the money,"My son absolutely loves the General Lee, and when I saw this product, I knew we had to have it. Seeing that it said, ""die cast,"" I naturally assumed it would be durable; yes, the die cast parts of the car are strong, but everything else plastic is falling apart. Of course, my son won't part with it, but this toy is just not worth the price."
4,Great buy. Good value.,"I'm very happy with this purchase. It came exactly as expected, and is a great value. I love to play chess, and was interested in finding a little more classy version of a portable chess set that I couldn't easily damage, and that I could use on the beach."
4,Chess To Go,"My son want a chess set that can take along to school, trip or overnight to friend's home. This is a great one to take along. It have a roll up base and good size chess. The only one thing that my son did not like was the carry tube lid does not stay close, always pop open and everything fell out."
1,Product information not accurate,The size of the chess set is not tournament size as advertised. It is smaller than the pictures shown and the actual tournament size! The price is not bad but you won't be buying something you think you are.
4,Yay!,"I like Heather Graham's writing style. Blues captures the angst of being alone, while surrounded by love struck friends and relatives. I laughed aloud at some antics and smiled at the care and tenderness between our main character and her grandmother. It is a worthy read."
5,Designers Bible,This book is a surfboard makers bible it goes over every single thing that you would possiable want to know. The price is unbeatable also. This is the only book you really need for designing.
2,Very Simple,"If I had a ten year old interested in WHY a surfboard is made to look the way it does then this would be the book for him/her. If you want a book that will help you craft a surfboard out of a blank material, the tools, material and tecniques needed, and provide step by step instruction; this isn't the book for you."
4,dench fans will love the book,"if you are a dench fan you will love the book. it is packed with information. the only drawback for some may be the style in which it is written. the author seems to have approached it more like a research paper rather than a book. but this does mean there is much material... and a good read if you're not looking for the slick, overly editing books we have become used to."
4,Medium Mesh Chain,Good quality for the money and stronger then some I have had in the past. Again its a good product for the price.
2,"Great illustrations, awful text","I have to say my two year old loves this book and I hate it. Its got gorgeous illustrations, filled with the kind of details that toddlers enjoy. The text, however, is horrendous, some of it doesnt even sound grammatically correct (""Trunk packing, seat calling, belts fastening."" and ""Same route driving, same time arriving""). Good childrens books have effortless rythm, but this one is so contrived."
4,A compliment to Dig Dig Digging,"My son loves Dig Dig Digging and he loves trains, this was right up his alley. We have read it almost every night for weeks."
3,Bing Crosby Cavalcade of Songs [IMPORT],"What was attractive about this CD is that it contains songs not found on other CD's. Songs are from KMH Radio Shows from 1939,40, and 41.What I discovered in playing the CDs is the quality leaves much to be desired. It appears as though no attempt was made to clean up the surface noise or the clicks and pops. I say this because with little effort I was able to clean up appreciably the 3 or 4 that I worked on.All in all, the price is right and I am not too disappointed"
4,A struggle for life. A country against a man.,"SMERSH, Russia's ""murder department"", are out toget 007 killed. A lure is laid in the form of avivacious lady, who later switches sides to become the Bond Girl. A murderous, herculean maniac and a dedicated head of execution are hell bent on Bond's blood. Plotted in a turmoiled Turkey, it is many a difficulty Bond has to face to save himself, or rather save what he can of himself!"
3,It hasn't done anything.,"The smell is pleasant and subtle, the texture is smooth and light. It just hasn't improved anything! All of my wrinkles and bags are just as prominent as they were to begin with. Kinda disappointed."
3,Undecided,"I don't dislike this cream, but I'm not sure yet that it's doing too much. I do like the consistency and the slight tingle I get when I apply, but time will tell on the results I suppose."
4,"Let's face it, eye creams are all the same !!!!!","Lets get to the point this anti-wrinkle eye cream is CHEAP and that is why most of you gals purchased it. Department store wrinkle & firming creams are way-way over-priced and you all are aware of that fact. I've paid $85.00 for less than one oz. for a high-priced, over the top name BRAND, and all your complaints for this L'Oeal product are most definitely inter-twined with the ideal, over-priced, high-end Department Store product. Get my point, girls? They are all the same but this L'Oreal Anti-wrinkle, firming moisturizer eye cream is actually non-greasy, soothing, comfortable, no perfumed aroma and CHEAP....... My bag are still there too. It don't get rid of the wrinkles, believe me but it is better than using nothing. It truly feels good after being on for 4/6 hours. Worth giving it a shot."
4,Great product! Been using it for years!,"I first started using this product about 10 years ago, when a sample could be had at the pharmacy for around 2.50. This sample came in a tube with a narrow nozzle. Then the samples stopped and I had to buy the real thing. It comes in a bottle and yes, you have to keep dipping your fingers every time you apply it.It recommends it be applied twice daily, but I only do it once - I just forget at night. But even so, I have less eye wrinkles than my sister or younger cousins with the same skin type. Maybe, if I used it as recommended, I would look as young as my nieces! But I am satisfied with looking younger than my sister.It is not greasy - and I like that, but rather light. It gets absorbed very quickly, allowing me to apply makeup in a few minutes.Were it sold in a pump or tube I would give it 5 stars.""No wrinkles at 50""."
5,Great product -- especially for firming skin around eyes,"I've been using this product for years because it is excellent for firming saggy, delicate skin around the eyes. The skin around my eyes tightens immediately after I put it on. I've tried other eye creams but always go back to this one. I really hope they never stop making it!"
3,Eye cream,"Product feels good going on and no irritation. I am skeptical because I know most all eye creamssold have a 6 month shelf life and even in stores have no way of telling on most brands the actual expiration date. Unfortunately, the same is true in this case. I have only used one jar to date and have seen no visual results as of yet, but will try again to monitor due to good price."
5,love it,"I use this every morning and every night .I've been using it for a couple of years i also use other loreal products i use all of them daily and a little goes a long way,it last me a couple of month's."
2,I don't see any diffrent at all,"Maybe i'm not consistent applying 2 times a day, but so far for 2 weeks I don't see any difference may I need to finish the whole bottle"
5,Excellent results in just a few days,"My eyes were a little puffy from allergies, even though I take allergy medicine daily. I started using this and not only did the puffiness go away, so did most of the wrinkles. I'm 31 and I've been getting a lot of comments on my skin lately (the only change is that I've been using this eye cream). It is light, doesn't bother my eyes, even with daily contacts, and it absorbs quickly. I only use it once a day though, and I think it recommends using it like three for four times a day."
1,Not As Described,I have been using this product for three weeks no results at all. The container is very small. I think I wasted my money. I do not recommend this product.
1,itchy eye,"This is a terrible product. Immediately after applying it my eyes began to itch and burn. I tried it 5 times over a 4 day period, thinking maybe my eyes had to get worse before they got better, but could not stand it any longer. I may contact the manufacturer."
4,Easy to use,I like the way the little long tip dispenses just the right tiny amount to pat on your eyelids. Some noticeable results in terms of slightly smoother skin and wrinkles but I doubt it compares to the L'Oreal Triple Action Eye Serum but I can't afford that.
2,Testimony-boring,"This was the most boring book that I have read. It had a very slow begining. It was a struggle to get through. For excitement, I recommend Church Folks, Tomorrow may never come, or, Singsation."
5,Great Reissue Of A Great Pat Travers Album,"HEAT IN THE STREET is a great Pat Travers album, and this reissue only improves what was already Travers' best album ever. Travers' music was a blend of the hard rock of Montrose and Foghat, the Southern rock of the Allman Brothers Band, the Outlaws, the Marshall Tucker Band, and Lynyrd Skynyrd, and the funky R&B of artists such as War and 70s-era Isley Brothers that inspired the metal-R&B fusion of Living Colour in the late 80s and the rap-metal sound of the following decade. The title track is a hot rocker that's great to listen to while exercising, but the whole CD is great. HEAT IN THE STREET is a must-own for any fan of blues-based rock & roll."
4,Good metal,"I hate to give less than 5 stars to such good music, but the vocals just aren't my style. Its a scratchy sort of more old school death metal vocal style. But the music is a very solid all over the metal spectrum type of sound.I could see someone coming to the conclusion that this is very typical new wave of death metal/metalcore or whatever the hell people say. But I could also see someone separating this band as something a little but original. I haven't yet put my finger on it, but I agree with this view.Also, Tom Araya's brother is in the band so they'll be touring, getting huge exposure with slayer/Lamb of God/mastadon because of it.In sum, maybe the scratchy death metalish vocals will turn you off, otherwise you'll either like it or you don't belong on this page to begin with."
3,thrash for the second decade of the millenium,"""In the wake of separation"" is the second album by Canadian metal band Thine eyes Bleed.There are a few catchy tunes most notably Cold Victim. Recommended for fans of this genre and for those who want to explore the latest extreme varieties of metal.There is a complexity inherent in the songs' guitar riffs and the record is interesting and really furious although some songs are utterly forgettable. However, if your cup of tea is over the top metal riffing this is your ticket to nirvana"
4,He saw it coming,"This is a good a useful look at the way news and information were managed in the first Gulf War (1990-91). It skewers the media for being more interested in ""access"" than in reporting anything remotely like the truth about what was going on. Newspaper editors and TV executives are exposed as men and women looking for ""product"", stuff they can sell that will go down easy with a population they fear and distrust. Like in 2003, they want a simple story line with a designated ""good guy"" and a designated ""bad guy"" and no history or context to confuse the narrative. This book should have been read and absorbed by the media, and would have been if they were interested in performing the criitcal watgchdog role of truth-tellers. Most of them, however, are more interested in not rocking the boat and being stenographers to power."
4,Increased my Water Pressure!,"I bought this item not because I wanted to save water, but because my house has pretty low pressure to begin with and I prefer to have high-pressure showers. It did the trick! It is very powerful and both my wife & I think it is a huge improvement over our previous showerhead. I do have to admit that it is a little odd though, because as you are getting a shower, your head thinks you are getting drenched, but the amount of water that is hitting you is actually pretty low. For instance, it takes longer to get a washcloth wet, even though it feels like it shouldn't. I know I'm not making much sense, but it's a difficult phenomenon to describe! All in all, this is much better than what I thought it was going to be and a wise purchase for us. The only thing that I'm concerned about is that we have hard water and that the oxygenating holes might fill with residue left from the water."
3,"It's not a 'shower' head, but 'hosing' head. Pressure is too high to enjoy the shower.","Length:: 1:38 MinsI bought this in February, and I've replaced it in June. This shower head saves water by making showers unpleasing and thus shorter. On the low pressure setting, the drops are large and splash everywhere when they hit you instead of actually showering you.On the high pressure setting I have the feeling of being hosed down by firefighters.The noise doesn't bother me as much as the splashing and hosing."
5,THIS SHOWERHEAD IS AMAZING,"There are about two thousand showerheads out there on Amazon, and while I can't speak for all of them, I can say this is the best one I've ever used, by far. I live up on a hill and the water pressure is terrible, but this showerhead greatly boosts the amount of pressure I feel, without losing the size of the stream. I'm not sure how the physics of this works; I just know it makes for a great shower, and what is it- thirty dollars? Something like that. If you have a wimpy showerhead get one of these and give it a try. I even bought one for a friend- these are one of the few ""gadgets"" that I've ever purchased that lived up to it's promise. Excellent product."
2,Increased pressure but splashes wall,"I have really low water pressure and this helped to increase the pressure which was great. But my tile doesn't go to the ceiling, it goes about 18 inches below ceiling and I found water was hitting above the tile which it didn't with my old shower head. So be prepared to have the spray going all over the place which will eventually damage the sheet rock. If you have tile all the way up, you should be fine. I also find have to turn up the water temperature higher than before to get the same warmth, probably since there's less water flowing and being mixed with air."
3,Expected more,"I had previously purchased this product for another location and have been pleased with the sensation of increased pressure from a low pressure water source. This one, however, does not appear to function as well, even though the home water pressure is higher. I am not sure why, but I think it may have to do with the distance you are away from the shower head. If you are considering this product, you might want to plan to have your head and the shower head within a foot or so of each other."
5,Love this shower head,"This is the third of this model shower head I have owned. When a product is good and built right, go back to it. I have lived at three different addresses in the past 10 years. I have purchased one of these shower heads for each place, and leave it behind when I leave, and buy a new one for the next place. This will help reduce water usage, as well as give you a nice shower spray. Nice Product!!!!"
3,good product.....,"We live in an apartment building and the water pressure is terrible. I've tried several different shower heads but this one is by far the best I have tried. If you have low water pressure and you don't enjoy your showers, try this!"
4,Fabulous Shower Head..,"I bought this shower head to replace an older one in my primary shower, and I couldn't be happier. Yes, I gave it 4 stars, but 5 stars is a very, very special product indeed, and this is, after all, a shower head...I bought this after returning home from vacation in Yellowstone - one of the motels we stayed at had this shower head, and I loved it, so I bought one when I got home. My old shower head sometimes made a high pitched noise which I was able to resolve until I installed this gem. I can make it very strong, or really weak, just by making an adjustment with the level on the right-hand side of the unit. At full power, it really is loud - too loud it would seem, but it's something I'm willing to forgive for the powerful mist that is just perfect in the morning before work!"
2,not what it claims,"I purchased this after alot of research & review reading. I received it, my husband installed it and it does not do what it claims. We have low water pressure and I was having trouble rinsing out shampoo, this helped a little bit but by the time the water reaches the rest of your body, theres no pressure. The valve is silly too, even if you put it on low, you are still using the same amount of water. Its a little noisy too."
2,shower mizer water head,"THE PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK THE WAY IT STATED SO IN THE ADVERTISEMENT, I AM NOT HAPPY WITH IT AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE"
4,Great showerhead!,A great water saving shower head that feels good on your skin. The only down side that Is see is that it creates more water vapor in your bathroom and leads to higher humidity levels in your home.
5,Great Showerhead,"We experienced these in Steam Boat, and loved them. My parents ordered them, we finally did too. They produce a powerful blast that is easily adjustable. Yet they use much less water than traditional shower heads so that helps when kids are taking showers. The lifetime warranty is a great plus. In our experience, you can't go wrong with this showerhead."
2,Does not work well with low Pressure,"Saw this at a friends house, very impressed. Ordered because people reported it worked well with low pressure. Not the case for me. We have low pressure and it is a completely different experience than when operated under normal water pressure."
2,weak,did not like this at all. It did not spread around me and i was cold.. i felt like this was saving water ... and it was not comfortable. Ended up buying the Delta 75152 and it was MUCH better! save your time and let me tell you which one to get. I bought two of the Deltas in the end
4,Great showerhead for low pressure,"Showerhead adjusts from low pressure pulse to high pressure, and works well at all pressures. One concern is that the venturi nozzle that allows it to have good velocity with low pressure also sucks in air and can get noisy - definitely much noisier than one of those rain-type showerheads! Overall a good value."
5,A wonderful product,"I used one of these showerheads in a hotel once, and had to find one. This is absolutely the best low flow showerhead I have ever used. I highly recommend them!"
4,"Excellent pressure, good for the environment","This product was delivered quickly after ordering. The product was undamaged and the chrome was in perfect condition (no scratch). It was easy to install and it has a very powerful jet. The showerhead should always be left pointing straight ahead for best performance. Overall, an excellent product. I recemmend it."
3,It's nothing special,"I've got terrible water pressure at my apt complex, so like you, I searched the internet for the best showerhead. The reviews for this one had me dreaming of a real shower. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype. Maybe I was just expecting too much, but this showerhead is nothing special. Yes, it creates more pressure than an average showerhead, but it's nothing to write home about."
5,great for low pressure in newer construction,"They don't make them like they used to. This saying seems to apply tenfold to residential plumbing RE: water pressure PSI. Nothing like the simple but powerful spray of my boyhood home. This showerhead, however, makes a big difference. As some reviewers have said, the spray can be a bit much, sharp and prickly. Luckily, the built in valve allows you to set the spray just right with minimal effort. No more rinsing under a trickle!"
4,Overall am impressed,"I bought this showerhead to replace my current low flow showerhead. I am happy with it overall, however it is a bit on the loud side. I don't think it is quite a 747 in volume, however I do have to turn the radio louder. Also, I have noticed that I need to turn the water hotter. Overall I think it's a good showerhead and would recommend it though."
3,Oxygenics Shower Head,"I bought this shower head to replace the standard head that came with the house, which is just too sparce of a spray.Initially, the Oxygenics spray felt too forcefull and stung a little like being on a speedboat in the rain. Unfortunately, our shower hardware does not allow you to turn down the pressure without turning the water colder. Also, I didn't feel I was getting a good soak. Immediately after a shower, it seemed I had already toweled off somewhat compared to my standard shower head.It may be worth a try if your hardware allows you to turn the pressure down while maintaining a hot shower. Otherwise, I'd try something else."
4,"Great shower head if you have low pressure, but it's loud!","If you have problems with low water pressure, this shower head will help. It does a great job of generating a forceful spray, but it creates a lot of noise in the process. If you don't mind the extra decibels, it's a great product."
3,noisy; cheap plastic lever,"I've been usingWater Saver Shower Headsince ca. 1996 at my parents house, two houses in college, two apartments after college, and now my house. I installed this Oxygenics thinking I could save some water. Not worth the extra 0.5GPM I save. The oxygenics has to be at full blast whereas the ShowerSaver model is comfortable at about half flow. We have a water softener but the plastic lever on this oxygenics became unmoveable after a few months. The lever was bending a bunch and seemed like it was going to break. After maybe a year, I put theWater Saver Shower Headback in my shower."
2,Fancy Shower Head,"This shower head is very attractive and offers the ability to change the pressure with a quick twist of the plastic controller. It probably saves a lot of water, because although it mixes air with water to give the feel of getting a normal shower, there just isn't enough water coming through to do a good job. I'm going to keep using it, because of the water savings, but I'm a little disappointed that the pressure isn't even close to the old shower head."
1,DISASTER,Worst Shower Head period. Returned it after 1 day. Terrible for water pressure just a bad cheap shower head. All the other 5 star reviews must live in a trailer or something where it may help hose water pressure. DON'T BUY>>WASTE OF TIME!
5,I am very happy,"To say that a trickle of water came out of my shower would be an understatement. I ordered this showerhead after reading through the reviews, and am absolutely amazed and thrilled at the difference it has made. I feel like I am taking a real shower again. Yes, it can be noisy, but nothing I can't live with."
5,The best shower head EVER - wish I could take it with me!,This is the best show head I have ever had. You will LOVE it. Great power and water feels perfect. Never clogs and can turn down when you shave etc. Just the best. Lifetime warranty so if ever an issue you just pay a few bucks S&H to get a new one. Just tops!!!
2,Not the best shower head,"I was excited about this showerhead after reading up on it through the company website but was dissapointed with it's performance. The way the waters feels through the oxygen system isn't to my liking, but I guess it's just personal preference. One thing that I really didn't like was the fact I wrote the company about an exchange and never heard back from them."
1,$12 waisted on shipping,"I was very disappointed in this product. It does, indeed increase the pressure, but less water is used. The result is a sharp mist. The farther away you are from the shower head, the worse it is. I could barely get the soap rinsed off of my legs. Returned it."
3,I bit too strong spray pattern.,"The showerhead produces a strong spray. (some may like this) The adjustable spray head went from a strong (too harsh for me) fine spray to a ""blobby"" gentle spray. Moved it into the guest bath and will use another softer spray showerhead in my master bath. It does have a nice appearance."
2,No Focus,It's a functional shower head. But I thought that it would have better adjustability. It's basically on or off. There's no real way to adjust the flow.
2,Great water pressure but spray to wide to wash,"I got this because the consensus was, the shower head was wonderful if you had low water pressure. Our house has pretty crapy water pressure so that part of this shower head I will rate as a 5. However my wife is short and by the time the water reaches her the spray has widened so much it's hard to even rinse off. She has long hair and even getting her hair wet enough to add shampoo was a challenge. I kept the shower head for our other bathroom that also needed a low flow spray. But I wouldn't purchase this for the spray reason so that part I give a 1."
1,strange showerhead,"If you are right in front of the shower head it is very strong and feels great. However, mostly air perssure and very little water. Once you get more than 18 inches away from the shower head, there is very little pressure or water flow."
5,Great showerhead,This my second Oxygenics showerhead. I've had the first one for about 5 years and it is still working great. No calcium buildup during this time. It produces a strong flow. I love it.
5,Transformative,"We bought our first Oxygenics shower head a few years ago and have been so impressed by it that we gave two of them to our daughter and her family for Christmas. They are in the midst of rehabbing a house and the shower heads have completely transformed the experience in both of their showers. We also purchased the one I am reviewing now for use in our other shower. There is nothing negative to say about this product. It looks very sharp. It works exceedingly well, and it conserves water. To do so while still providing a powerful shower experience is amazing. I highly recommend it."
5,sansha original canvas ballet slippers,Would recommend ordering any dance supplies from this company. My order was delivered promptly and in good condition. Also sent me a couple of free items. Thanks.
2,Sizing matters,I have a very large foot. I purchased one size larger than my normal shoe. Instead the slipper I received was more like two sizes smaller. If you know the correct size I will admit that the shoe is well made and if it fits it should wear well.I was very disappointed. I will simply give the shoes to a relative with smaller feet.
4,Nice Ballet Slippers,"Nice construction. Allows gripping and sliding on the floor as needed. I wear 4.5/5 in regular shoes so I ordered 5 narrow and they were a little bit loose, but definitely workable by adjusting the elastic straps. Order came super fast and nicely packaged!"
4,superb folk metal!,"I don't understand why Skyclad is so hard to get in the U.S., considering that they are one of the premier metal bands of the decade. ""Vintage Whine"" is their ninth full-length release and features a return to a heavier sound similar to that found on ""Irrational Anthems."" The CD suffers slightly in the production department, the vocals sounding strangely muffled at times, especially on the song ""On with Their Heads!""Nevertheless, this is an essential album for fans of progressive, Celtic, and folk metal/rock. With a full-time fiddler plying her seductive melodies, sardonic and witty lyrics, and some of Skyclad's catchiest songwriting, this album is one of the top ten metal releases of 1999. Compelling power-metal stompers ""The Silver Cloud's Dark Lining"" and ""Cancer of the Heart"" are set off by ballad ""A Well Beside the River"" and jig-compatible ""Little Miss Take."" Extraordinary fun!"
4,Plank Grilling,Bought this and some cedar planks and we are in Salmon heaven. Lots of other meats and the Cedar flavor is heaven. Enjoy this book if you love great food.
5,a hit at any barbecue party,There is no more pleasant a presentation than plank grilling a dish outdoors on the grill and then presenting the (cooled) plank to your guest to eat their feast directly off the plank. Try the salmon with peach mango salsa; a gourmet delight with easy preparation. (I served a party of twenty in this manner which received ovations and salutations!) These Sacramento girls know how to do it. The book has easy to folow recipes and great hints on just about anything you want to grill.
5,Great plank cookbook,"I saw this book when I was vacationing in Anchorage Alaska last summer, and I did not get it at the time. I was able to locate through Amazon. The recipes are amazing, and instruction and illustrations are great. If you enjoy experimenting and trying new things in the kitchen or outdoor grill, this is a great investment.The Plank Grilling Cookbook: Infuse Food with More Flavor Using Wood Planks"
3,Plank grilling cookbook,it's ok but not exactly what I thought it was. Good for advanced plank grillers.
2,Caution!,I'm new to plank grilling so tried to follow the directions explicitly on plank preparation and burnt half my first plank before adding any food. Watch carefully when searing the plank - the times given may be for thicker planks than mine. Have not tried any of the recipes yet.
2,Does not live up to hype.,"The book leaves you a bit empty. Not great tips, and limited number of recipies."
2,Pretty weak,It's not the worst music I ever heard but I wouldn't spend money on it. I bought this CD just to try them out and it was just... not worth the time or money. The production is sloppy and the songs are extremely amateurish. I hate to put them down but they really need to hook up with a real songwriter and record producer.
1,No relation,"Someone had this cd recommended under the Brainscapes 2001 album. I also see this cd being compared to work by Pink Floyd. Normally i am very polite but comparing this to Pink Floyd is insane, and Brainscapes walks all over this gospel snooze.- ""In the beginning God created the earth"" (yes folks, actual lyrics - can you see where this album is headed?)To all the Sacred Sky fans: Tell your televangelist buddy to stop leaving crank recommendations in music areas of a different genre, or I'll start leaving Marilyn Manson recommendations on this page."
5,Lively and personal work of scholarship,"This book, from the greatest literature teacher ever, should definitely be available. As interesting as O'Hara is, Grebstein on O'Hara - or on anything - is vastly more intriguing."
1,This DVD is horrible!,"I wish I could give this zero stars, but that is not an option. Without even thinking about it, I allowed my son to watch this without veiwing it myself first. I did watch it with him though. I bought this DVD for my autistic son thinking he would love watching it. He really loves animals. I knew the first episode would be about endangered species. I thought it would be talking about these animals and how we are helping them by creating breeding programs and rehabilitation programs. Instead it was full of topics on why these animals are disappearing. They use the word ""slaughter"" repeatedly. They even play gunshots in the background. Since there are three episodes on this DVD I will keep this and let my son only watch the last two episodes until I can get something to replace it. Anyone who knows an autistic child also knows you can't just remove something they love without having something to replace it with first."
5,My son loves this Animal Atlas movie,"Bought this movie for my son for his 3rd Birthday. He was so excited, he took it every where with him. Yes, I would buy again."
4,A Clean Bird Is a Happy Bird,"This works reasonably well for our umbrella cockatoo. It does, however, seem a bit less stable than we'd like."
4,Classic story but dated,"H Beam Piper was one of my favorite authors from my youth. His stories often remind me of Robert Heinlein's Youth series, but a bit edgier. This story is a adventuresome romp with classic space opera motifs. The only grudging aspect is that it was written in the early 1960s and microchip was not even on the RADAR of science fiction authors. This tends to make the reader chuckle about many aspects of the storyline, if not ruining the overall story."
2,Snooze,"This was another free book, and the genre really isn't what I look for in reading material. But the price was right."
2,Yellowneck,Only for buffs of the War Between the States. Story of a group of Greybacks near the end of the war in Florida that is not your tipical war film.
4,Truly great,"This is very strange indeed. Dark Heresy sounds like Skyclad playing death metal, plus a whole lot of progressive and acoustic elements. Some of the songs could have been better, but the overall feeling of this album is truly great."
4,"GREAT, TALENTED BAND!",Dark Heresy are an amazing band. They are still ood following the departure of their original singer. There is a new singer who is better than the original singer 'Kola'. I have seen them live. They crush. Very exceellent!
2,Disappointing,"I bought this CD on a recommendation by a friend, but having just listened to it, I think it just sounds like generic death metal and I am not very impressed. It is not the worst stuff ever, but a little electronic keyboard and church choirboy-type-lead singer does not an original CD make!"
2,Downward spiral following departure of leader...sad...,"Obvious production problems hide superior lyrics and technically competent guitar playing. Look for DARK HERESY'S earlier work, it's better. Look for future releases from band leader/musical talent Kola Krause."
5,Worth owning!,"I love this series. It's on TV several times a year (I think the Syfy channel), but it's really worth owning it to see it uncut all the way through. If you buy all three titles in the series, be sure to watch ""Rise of the Lycans"" first. Even though it was produced third, it's actually a prequel to the first two movies. Can't wait 'til the fourth one becomes available for purchase...didn't get to see it at the theater."
4,GOOD TWOSOME,"IT IS GREAT HAVING BOTH MOVIES IN ONE SET TOO BAD THIS CAME OUT BEFORE THE THIRD MOVIE DID IT WOULD BE NICE HAVING ALL THREE TOGETHER, BOTH ARE GOOD MOVIES."
5,Modern Day tech mixed with folklore.,"Not only does this movie combine modern-day technology with the folklore of vampires, but it does so REALLY WELL.Also the lead actress is very hot."
5,Good Movie!!!!,The reason that I purchased this movie is because is a very good movie that we all enjoy. Fast Delivery!!!Very Satisfied with this movie!!!!!
1,DEFECTIVE MOVIES,I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN MY PURCHASE. UNDERWORLD HAD A VERY LOUD CRACKLING NOISE THROUGHOUT THE LAST HALF OF THE MOVIE. UNDERWORLD EVOLUTION HAD IT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE MOVIE. IT WAS HORRIBLY DISTRACTING AND RUINED OUR MOVIE WATCHING.
3,School shoes,"Bought these as school shoes for a 12 years old who is more used to the slightly pointy toes type of shoes. He is happy with them but I may not have bought them if I knew the toes look the way they are. Anyway, please look at the top profile view carefully and decide if these are the styles you like."
3,"Interesting idea, but seriously flawed story","""Faces in the Crowd"" provides an interesting look at crime and law enforcement in 1880's New York, but the author failed to properly research how the telephone system worked at that time. If he had, he'd have realized that it is preposterous to think it would have been possible to ""tap"" 8,000 telephone lines, let alone monitor them all."
1,Threw it away,I purchased this handheld vacuum. It stopped working after one week. I contacted the manufacturer who sent replacement parts. The machine worked for less than 5 minutes and stopped again. I threw the machine out! Total waste of money and didn't want to waste time trying to get a new machine to work properly.
1,The handheld is terrible - stopped working after 1 year,"I owned this for about a year when it stopped working. I had to continually depress the power button to get it to operate. Dyson customer service acted like it was all my fault and I was not operating it correctly, even telling me that they had no idea what I was talking about the way I explained my problem. They had me take it all apart, wash and clean everything, put it back together and call back. Then they told me they still couldn't help me. Of course, the one item I can't find my receipt for is this - it was a gift. It's not like any one else makes a vacuum remotely like this. I love my Dyson upright but will never try another cordless. I hope I don't ever need customer service on the upright."
1,Not good with dog hair,Do not buy if you have dogs. The input has an air restriction that quickly clogs with dog hair. Also as the hair is light it stays at the top of the dirt hold.
1,not worth the money at all,"Dyson DC16 Root 6 Handheld Vacuum CleanerI am extremely disappointed with this product. I had heard so much about Dysons that when I needed a handheld, it was the only one I would consider. The problem is that the battery, fully-charged, only runs for 5 minutes. I never get to finish a project- whether it's my car, kitchen, steps, etc - before the battery runs out. Not worth this kind of money AT ALL!"
1,So disappointed!,I was excited to purchase this Dyson Handheld Vacuum and hesitated due to the cost of $150.00. I went on prior info of their upright vacuums and didn't research here as I usually do and ended up with a poor purchase. I find it difficult to reconcile spending this kind of money for 5 minutes of usage and then to wait 3 hours to use it again. I called Target to see if I can return it and they said yes with original packaging and sales receipt. I'm very relieved and I also called Dyson to let them know how unhappy I was with this product. Just wanted them to have another voice to add to the pile of complaints.
1,There are better products for a lot less money,"This vacuum has been nothing but problems for me. The battery doesn't last longer than 10-12 minutes of cleaning. After a few months the machine wouldn't work at all. I called customer service, and she said it's a common battery problem and sent me a free replacement because it was still under warranty. About 6 months later, the same thing began to happen, but now the machine was out of warranty. Battery replacements are very expensive, more than the cost of several brand new competing handheld vacuums.The cleaning power is not very impressive, and considering the short battery life, it is not worth the money. I strongly recommend that people avoid this purchase and find a better value."
2,awful,"Battery is 21V and too small. This is the design problem. Compare, for example, an 18V brick for a DeWalt drill and you'll understand the difference. Dyson should have designed a lighter weight handheld and implemented a heavier, longer-lasting battery. His floor models are excellent, but the DC 16 needs a bigger battery. Look for Chinese-made after-market replacement batteries to add a second one as a backup or sell yours on Craigslist."
2,Not impressed,"Well, I purchased the Dyson Root 6, and I must say, I am very unhappy with it. The 6 minute battery life coupled with the awkward heaviness of the item makes it extremely annoying to use. If the Root 6 had the capability to plug into a wall, I wouldn't be writing this negative review. I'd probably be okay with how heavy and difficult it is to handle, but it seems ridiculous to me that I spent $150 on a product that works for 6 minutes at a time. Not to mention it doesn't even lift pet hair off of fabric. My el cheapo Bissell does that with no problem.I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it does actually work, it's just not practical. Furthermore, it would be nice if the box said that it only stays charged for 6 minutes. I wouldn't have purchased it if I had known beforehand. Serves me right for not doing research, but at the same time, when you see a name like ""Dyson"" you expect it to be a good product, worth the extra money.Sadly, this was a waste. I'm returning it to Best Buy."
2,So expensive for a 5 minute battery?,"Wow, I am a clean freak and bought a $50 Shark from Bed Bath & Beyond to pick up a lot of my dog's hair from our Pergo floors. So I decided to get the Dyson handheld to get those hard to reach places. I was so excited and it actually does pick up my lab's black hair. BUUUUTTTT, it's hard to pick it all up when the freakin' battery lasts only 5 minutes. I thought maybe mine was defective until I read other reviews that they experienced the same problem. I wish I would have bought the $30 dirt devil with the wedding gift cards I received. WHAT A WASTE!!! DON'T waste your money unless you don't plan on actually using it."
1,Battery operated vacuum cleaners suck--and not in a good way.,"All battery operated vacuum cleaners I've tried work for maybe 5 minutes, then they're worthless because they have no cord to keep them running after the battery goes dead. This Dyson is just like that. Believe me, you can't do much cleaning in only five minutes. To make matters worse, the heavy battery makes this model too clumsy to manuver easily. If you really want to have a vacuum handy for a small spill, buy youself a less expensive Dust Buster and have done with it. There are many hand held models on Amazon to choose from for only $20-$50.If this model had a cord, I'd buy it in an instant. Dyson makes great quality upright vacuum cleaners which last and last. Unfortunately, all this model has is a battery.Dear Dyson Engineers:Are you listening to your customers? How hard can it be to add a cord to this thing? And forget about creating a more powerful battery; I don't want a vacuum which works for only 9 minutes either!"
3,good but doesn't last long,"I really like this vacuum. Great suction power and its pretty heavy duty construction. However like most people have mentioned, the battery only lasts for around 4 minutes. I have a plan all laid out before I use this vacuum; you will often see me race around the house non-stop to get the most out of my 4 minutes. I pay very close attention to how long I have left to use the vacuum - making it count by not unnecessarily holding down the trigger. Yes its a hassle but when this vacuum does work, it works great!"
2,Battery Life,"This is a great little vacuum, but the battery life of less than 5 minutes needs to be fixed - perhaps wih a bit larger battery."
1,Are you kidding?,"I hate this stupid little dust collector! The exhaust air blows right in your face..it is sooo annoying! The constant air blast like a strong gust of wind aims right toward the eyeballs... makes your eyelashes flutter! Perhaps you can rig up a long pole or a stick to keep it away from the face.It is heavy and awkward. This over-priced hand-vac was an anti-climactic ""run of the mill"" performer, go buy a dust buster!Nancyev"
3,"Awesome power, bad battery life","Title says it all. Works great!! However, batter does die quickly with NO warning. Should include better battery or another for backup."
1,Don't Buy,Don't buy. You get very little life from one charge. You get about 5 minutes of continous suction for each charge. It then takes about 3 hours to recharge.
2,unimpressive,"I bought this to keep near my cats' litterboxes to vacuum up the litter particles they track onto the floor.Dyson went out of its way to make a futuristic looking vacuum, but it seems as if the vacuum is all style and little substance.First of all, the nozzle is very narrow, much narrower than a dustbuter. It barely picks up anything.And, I have found that if you are not using the vacuum, and just holding it with the nozzle pointing downward, pieces of whatever you just vacuumed up will fall out of the nozzle.Finally, the battery charge did not seem to last very long, even after staying in the charger when not in use.Overall, a very unimpressive product from Dyson.Stick to a good old Black & Decker dustbuter. It will do a much better job at less than half the price."
2,bought it based on the name Dyson - big mistake,"This is no better than any other portable vacuum that we have owned, and believe me we have been through several. I am really disappointed in this vacuum. It has a short battery life, and hsa such an odd shape that it makes it less than ideal for vacuuming in tight spots such as under car seats."
2,"Works OK, short run time, stuff gets stuck easily","OK product but the short battery life (down to 3 minutes after 5 months of light usage) is unacceptable. Worse, stuff larger than fuzz or dust gets stuck in the upper part of the chamber, requiring a pencil to scrape it out. Not recommened"
3,Works great while it's charged...,"This is the most powerful handheld vaccuum that I've ever used. However, after 6 minutes, it needs to be recharged (for quite a while). I would rate it 5 stars if they had included a power cord so that you could plug it in and keep using it. For most cars, though, 6 minutes is enough to vacuum the carpets and it does a great job."
2,"Average cleaning performance, sub-standard battery","Suction is ok - it does not lessen over time, but it also doesn't start off that terribly strong. You aren't going to pick up anything that isn't right below the nozzle. I was able to clean the tile stairway without a problem, though. I don't know how effective it would be if it were a heavy carpet - suction just doesn't seem strong enough for that. What really brings this product down is the horrible battery life. I had just finished the last stair and it died. A full charge only lasted about 6 minutes. And, when I sent an email to Dyson questioning if this was expected behavior or what could I do to improve the battery life, no response at all. So, between high price for the quality, 'OK' suction, and rotten battery life and customer service, 2 stars is all it gets. It would be down to 1 if the design wasn't so nice, as far as functionality and appearance."
3,Battery life is the killer,"(Revised after ~1 year) Suction is good, and is much better than a dustbuster. I mostly bought it for the attachments, which are very well designed, and because it just looks so freakin' cool. But I am really disappointed in the battery life, which is not mentioned anywhere on the website or the box. After about a year of using it every 2 or 3 days, the battery life is still an issue (I find myself ""Speed vacuuming"") and now the battery is starting to die, which apparently costs $75 even though on the commercial you can see it's just a pack of li-ion AAs. I still say go with the $30 dustbuster."
2,Dyson Root 6 - BATTERY LIFE 4-5 MINUTES for THREE HOUR CHARGE,"If you only have a few minutes of cleaning to do with this cute little dust buster, you'll be happy with this Root 6 expensive little vacuum. I had hoped to be able to clean blinds or the back of my car with this, but 4-5 minutes is not a lot of cleaning time. NO WHERE on the Dyson website did I find this information before buying this item. I emailed Dyson for the address of where to send the item back for a return and never got an answer. I called customer service and they did not provide me with the information and told me they were there for product information only! Now that I seem to be stuck with this item, please tell that guy to come up with some better colors for his machines!"
1,RUBBISH !!,"I purchased a Dyson Root handheld from Comet yesterday. Having been assured that it was ideal for cars and stairs, I duly gave it the required 3 hours charge (in fact, overnight). This morning my wife attempted to vacuum the stairs, but after the first 6 or 7, the cleaner stopped operating. I rang Dyson to complain and was told that the expected operating time was 5 minutes for a 3 hour charge ! There would therefore be insufficient power to clean half a car, let alone a complete flight of stairs. At least Comet have refunded the purchase price, without query, having been informed of the battery life."
1,don't buy!,"the dyson does not work and there is no way to figure out what is wrong because the paper that passes as a ""manual"" is only pictures--and not even accurate pictures!"
1,No suction and overpriced,"I bought this because I have a Dyson upright. The upright has good suction but is not very good on carpets or anything else and is very chintzy. I thought at least for a cordless the suction would be great and thats what matters for the handheld. Nope. The suction is minimal, the machine is the same chintzy build as the upright and the battery life is horrible. This, along with the hideous design, makes me wonder why I ever bought a dyson."
1,Pointless Rip-off,"I was excited when I saw that Dyson had come out with a handheld vacuum cleaner-- with various animals I allowed myself to think that it was just what I needed. What a mistake. A real waste of money and space. How much money did they save by putting in a battery that lasts less than 5 minutes? How irritating is it to have the machine stop in the middle of a job? My old Black and Decker was so far superior that I'd rather look for a used one at this point. It also does not do a better job at cleaning, suction, or anything else, and the charger takes up a lot of space on the counter. This verges on a rip-off. They do have good marketing, though. I wouldn't buy any of their products now. They are clearly simply greedy. What a Waste!!"
1,a dyson must mean bad,"This is pathetic. I keep hearing about Dyson, Dyson, Dyson. I could find a better vacuum anywhere. Like maybe a garage sale. Don't buy this. Bad, Bad bad."
3,POOR Battery!!,"I like the performance of the machine. The BATTTERY Sucks! I contacted Dyson for a replacement battery pack, $$$75.00!!!! plus shippimg!THAT SUCKS TOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Works great -- but serious battery problem,"I had high hopes for this vac and it does do a fantastic job for a handheld. The Root 6 is a little on the heavy side, but the design makes it easy to use and empty. The biggest problem is the ridiculously short operating time you get out of a battery charge. I got maybe 8-9 minutes of use on my first charge and that's being charitable. Maybe the performance will improve after ""conditioning"" the battery, but if I can't get 20-30 minutes on a charge, it's going back for a refund. As it stands, it's a toy and not a serious cleaning tool."
2,not much power,"i was very disappointed with this vac having heard all the hype over dyson. first off, not much suction power. i don't know the volts of this, but the dustbuser 15.6 and 18v i tried at the store worked better. worst of all, a fully recharged battery lasts only 6 minutes! i barely had time to vacuum my sofa when the power ran out and it still takes 3 hrs for the battery to fully recharge!! so in essence, you are only allowed to clean in 6 minute increments.i am returning mine immediately. not worth the money or hype."
1,Never worked right,"We had such high hopes for this burly looking handheld monster...but it's been a disappointment from the beginning. It only runs for a few seconds, then cuts out. We've cleaned the filter, the battery appears to be charged. I read on fixya.com a post that claims a faulty connection internally? Doesn't really matter, I'm a housewife, not an electrician. This really expensive thing doesn't work."
3,"Great suction, love the unit. Mine just died after 5 years","I don't need to re-iterate the battery life. At the 5 year point, it didn't last more than a few minutes.It has now lost all suction. It whines like crazy but doesn't pick up a stitch of lint anymore.I expected to get more than 5 years out of this unit after paying top dollar for it.The Dustbuster I replaced with this lasted twice as many years and was still working when I purchased this.Very disappointed."
1,Worst appliance purchase!!,"I love the upright but the hand held is absolutely useless. What good is a hand held vac if you cannot complete a simple job like a car interior or a stairway before it quits? The customer service for this product is non-existent. When we and also when our vacuum repair person tried to contact Dyson about the problem we were unable to get any response. Save your money. My $20 ""cheapie"" rechargeable hand held vac in the shape of a cow works better!"
1,overpriced and worthless - bad combination,"I have had this vacuum for about two years. In that time I have replaced the battery twice - VERY expensive and available only from Dyson. Now the unit is malfunctioning. It will run for about three seconds and then stop. Press the button again and it will work for another three seconds. I agree with an earlier review that the switch is a real hassle.I am one of those people who loves their Dyson upright. We have the Animal and think it is great. This handheld is a piece of junk. It's suction is no better than a cheap DustBuster. It it poorly balanced and very difficult to use. Even with a new, fully charged battery, it would only operate for about 5 minutes.I just threw this Dyson out and bought a Dirt Devil and I'm delighted. I just wish I hadn't spent so much money earlier for such a poorly designed product. I've learned my lesson: You don't always get what you pay for."
1,Decent Product but HORRIBLE Battery,"This vacuum works great.... when it has power. Our battery on it died after only a few months. It went from ~6 minutes of running when we first got it to bursts of 30 seconds. I can get about 6 bursts of power currently. It starts red no matter what runs for 30 seconds then shuts off, let it sit for 10 seconds then it will run for another 30 seconds and so on. Never again am I buying a Dyson, overpriced and don't last!!!!!"
1,"Performance great, reliability bad",The DC 16 has an internal fault switch that cuts power to the motor while there is still plenty of charge in the battery. It has a trigger switch and the vacuum will run only a minute or two before you need to click the trigger to get it running again. It will appear that the expensive battery is week when actually it's just a poorly designed vacuum. Spend your money on a less expensive portable vacuum so that you won't be so frustrated when you have to throw it in the trash.
1,Done with Dyson,"This little vac would be great if it actually worked. I feel cheated as most people in the BAD reviews mention getting 2-3 minutes of use out of their Dyson battery. I'd bother to use it if I could even get that. Mine gives me 10 seconds, and I AM NOT KIDDING. And in order to get what is left behind from of a small pile of crumbs it does not finish picking up, I have to repeatedly press the button to get the rest of it. Absolute waste of money.I also have an upright Dyson, powerful but not a good choice unless you have a huge house with wall to wall carpeting. Doesn't work for my home. Big regret. Now I'm looking at another brand for canister and handheld."
1,horrible battery life ruins its usefulness,"In terms of positives, it sucks up dirt really well. The fatal flaw with this device is it's crappy battery life. Even when brand new, I think I was able to get, at most 2-3 minutes of suction out of it before the battery needed to be recharged.Now, I get about 30 seconds of suction. I'll be throwing this out into the garbage in a couple minutes.Needless to say, i do not recommend this product."
1,Junk!,"This is a piece of crap. I purchased it for my wife who is a clean freak. We have 2 regular Dysons and love them. This thing stinks. Battery stinks, suction stinks, gets clogged all the time, on/off doesn't stay on, you have to hold it in the on position. Wrote the company, they said it is for limited use, little jobs. I said your commercial shows it cleaning stairways, not a little job. Tried it in the car for the mats, didn't pick up. Save your money....Dyson is starting to produce junk and take advantage of customers."
2,Poor battery - expensive battery replacement,"This product is a good vacuum, but the battery only allows operation between 4-7 min with a steady decline in the battery operation longevity. The battery died after 1.5 years and the cost for a battery replacement is $75.00...I would suggest NOT buying the product."
2,"Great Product When It Works, Battery No Longer Holds a Charge","I love my Dyson upright and thought the handheld would be a great companion for smaller jobs. It did work well for no more than 6-8 months. After that, my battery would not hold a charge. I thought I may not have it connected properly to the charger, but I have tried everything and it still will not work.I was going to buy a replacement battery, but it seems I may have more luck spending a little extra to buy a new model, with better reviews."
1,Finally Trashing Ours,"We give up. We have had the unit about a year or slightly longer, used it maybe once a week. Horribly short battery life and now the battery will not take a charge. We have the yellow Dyson upright and love it (except for the bizarre hand held attachments) and bought this one hoping for another good product.But it's just not worth spending any money on for a replacement battery - just to have a unit that works marginally."
1,steer clear,The unit only last less than 3 mins on a full charge. And after a year the battery died and they want $75 for a new one
2,Poor battery life ruins what could have been a really great hand vac.,"For a company that prides itself on engineering, Dyson has made a severe engineering error with this product and is, in my opinion, in a severely self destructive denial mode. I have owned it for 2 years and now the battery is down to 2 or 3 SECONDS. This product is otherwise well designed. Dyson should at least offer spare batteries (hopefully improved) at cost or an adapter to fit into the battery receptacle to turn it to a corded model. I would even pay for this to be able to recoup usage for the unit. This is, after all, not a cheap vacuum considering that it is a portable. I would not recommend this product."
2,Unacceptable performance for $150,"This handheld vac is flawed in many ways. 1) battery life is about 5 minutes. 2) The unit is heavy and unbalanced. 3) the dust cup release requires painful amounts of pressure to release and finally, 4) the on/off trigger must be squeezed while vacuuming. This was truly a disappointing purchase and it will keep me from buying any other Dyson product in the future. I sure am glad I held onto my trusty old Dustbuster."
1,Dyson Sucks or does it?,My Dyson DC16 Root 6 stopped working after a about a year of little use. The battery would last less than 5 minutes which was very frustrating. I would say that it sucked as a quality product but it didn't suck as a hand held vacuum. The warranty is only 12 months long. When that runs out so does the vac.
3,Good and bad,"Good powerfull vacuum, just what I am looking for. But you will only happy very short time the batter need major improvement."
1,Not a good investment,"I had the opportunity to check out this Dyson. I was interested in it because it looks like a space gun. And I wanted to see if it had a powerful suction.However, even though it 'doesn't lose suction', I wasn't overly impressed with its suction capability.I have a Black and Decker 15.6V Dustbuster that I got for a fraction of the cost of the Dyson. It has incredible suction, the battery lasts a heck of a long time, and takes a few seconds to dump and clean out. The issue of clogging never really comes up cause it is so quick to dump the litter out of it.The Dyson, in my opinion, would be money poorly spent."
1,Battery Life - don't bother,"I love my Dyson upright vacuum and was so excited to hear about having a hand held for cleaning my car, hard to reach places, and basic spills, but because of the HORRIBLE battery life none of those basic things have EVER been done in completion! Almost instantly the battery life gives out and I am stuck holding this huge disappointment of a purchase! DO NOT waste your money... I'm actually horribly disappointed that they even released this to consumers with this major flaw. They should issue a replacement battery base free of charge for those of us who trusted that Dyson would deliver a quality product for the price."
5,"Pricey, but worth it.","After owning many other hand vac's I finally ponied up and bought a Dyson. It was expensive, but worth it. If it continues to perform as well as it has been, I may actually buy a full size Dyson."
4,Dyson,"This is a great product. Does everything you expect. Great suction power, easy to use, and useful accessories. Only has one negative, battery runs down too quickly. Last only about 15-20 mins with continuous use."
1,very disappointing,"Just a few minutes of battery run time make this near worthless. Get a dustbuster, or for the same price, get 7 of them."
4,Great Product ... Short Battery Life ... (Great for Honey Do's),"Great Product ... Short Battery Life ... (Great for Honey Do's)Folks - Gotta tell you that this is a great product as far as the performance, price, long lasting ??? This is where we have to advise that the battery life is extremely a let down that leaves our wives wanting more... (ya know) ... The unit I purchased in 2009 has most definitely stood the ""Test of Time"" . Nevertheless I am going through the second battery replacement and now going for a third. While Dyson replaced the second at no charge (warranty).. This last one has to be purchased..Now I'm happy to report that the aftermarket 21.6V 1500 MAH provided through Amazon.com actually gives longer last power up to 9-10 minutes in some cycles.... Check Out link to see for battery replacement {Hope This Helps All}HQRP 1500mAh Battery for Dyson DC16 Root 6 / Animal / ISSEY MIYAKE exclusive Vacuum Cleaners Replacement plus HQRP Coaster"
1,Dyson clearly fooled me,I thought this handheld would have superior suction but it disappointed. A way overpriced handheld vacuum. I cannot believe how worthless this piece of junk is. If you really want this thing look for a refurbished one to save money.
1,Rubbish,"This is an incredibly useless product. It never worked for me and eventually would only operate for short bursts of a few seconds at a time. Over time Dyson replaced the 'battery charger' which did not help, they then replaced the battery which also did not help. Finally when the conclusion from customer service was that I needed a new 'body' the product was out of warranty and I was told that I would have to buy that from them. Since this cost more than a new Hoover handheld I politely declined. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! I will not buy any further Dyson products after this"
2,Crummy battery,"The vacuum does a great job for small pickups. Others have mentioned that the battery only lasts a few minutes before needing recharging. My battery has died, a few days past the warranty, and Dyson is charging almost $75 for a replacement battery. This is ridiculous. I can't recommend this vacuum based on my experience."
3,Almost,"I was literally on the phone with Dyson, giving my information to make the purchase while reading Amazon reviews. I commented to them that the reviews were at the extremes, either 5's or 2's and the 2's all centered around the run time. That's when Dyson confirmed that on a full-charge the Root 6 will last for about 6 min. It was designed for quick pick-ups and not the uses I intended, such as cleaning the stairs and vacuuming my car (I own dogs). She couldn't tell me if Dyson would produce a better battery anytime soon. I own a Dyson, so I was already sold based on my experience. But I can't use a cordless vacuum with a runtime of less than 20 minutes. THANKS, Amazon reviewers - you saved me some money and I'm hoping to do the same for someone else. By the way, Dyson's list price for an extra battery is $80."
1,$75 for a f****** replacement battery!?!?!?,The battery lasted less than a year. It costs half the price of the original unit just to replace the battery.
4,"Great, but no stamina and noisy","This portable Dyson works as well as our floor model, but it runs out of power very quickly so multiple cleaning projects will not be accomplished in one session. Also, the motor is so powerful that it literally screams--and this powerful motor is why the battery runs down so quickly."
2,Over priced,"The Dyson DC16 Root 6 works as advertised, but is over priced. It's run time is only five (5) minutes, and at five minutes it shuts down, no questions asked, and must be recharged before it will run again, sometimes taking three (3) hours. There is no on-board storage for the attachments either. In my opinion, the Black and Decker Dustbuster is a better bang for your hard earned buck."
2,Too expensive for 6 minutes,"This is a lot of money for something that only lasts for six minutes, and needs three hours to charge."
4,Love it for quick jobs,"I love this product for quick cleanups. Its grip and trigger make it easy to handle and operate. The included crevice tool and small brush tool make this unit much more versatile than other hand-helds with their snub noses. It's so easy to grab and use quickly, I use it often. Yes, the battery life is ridiculously short, but swiping around floor edges and corners, sucking up crumbs, cleaning out drawers and cabinets, vacuuming computer keyboards and the like, are usually fast jobs. The motor runs only when you are squeezing the trigger so it's an on and off type arrangement rather than constant on, which extends working time. It can sit unplugged from the charger for a couple of days and still operate when needed, although they recommend storing it in the charger--which generally I do. I've only had the battery run out on me once, but it recharges quickly so I was not all that inconvenienced. Overall, I've found it far more useful than other hand-held units I've tried."
1,"DySon hand held, more like dissappointing","i brought this product from Amazon, charged it , and started to clean my car, and wasn't even done from the driver side mat when the battery died, and had to re charge the battery again for 2 hours. vacuum has good suction but no battery life.Final Review. BUY it is you are desperate for a car vacuum, and even if you are still don't buy it, waste of money."
5,Great suction for a portable,"I've always been a fan of the Dysons and was glad when they came out with a handheld. It has much better suction than other battery-powered vacuums I've had, and is super fast to empty. The 6 minute battery life many annoy some, but it's just as advertised, and I knew that when I bought it. I would rather have this Dyson with great pick-up power for six minutes than a wimpy vac that does a lousy job for 15 minutes."
1,Does not last long!,"I did not have this product very long and the battery on it stopped working properly. It would turn off after just a couple of seconds, but if I released the button and pushed it again, it would start working again. In the year that I had this, I moved and had a baby, so I just used it as is and did not contact dyson. By the time my life was back to normal, it had been over a year and Dyson refused to do anything about the battery. I paid $260 for this and it is NOT worth it. To replace it, I got the cordless swivel sweeper and it works great. It was only $25 at a local store and a much better deal."
1,Battery life is a real problem,"I bought this knowing that the battery would last 6 minutes. It seems like 6 minutes would be enough for most small jobs, and it is for many, but it does limit what you can do with the vacuum.The bigger problem is that my two year old battery is now shot. A charge now lasts about 3 to 5 seconds. The cost to replace the battery for this unit is more than the total cost of a non-Dysan replacement device.Stay away."
1,"nice design, horrible battery","Just another voice in the chorus of protest about the horrible battery life of this unit and the added insult of charging $75 for a replacement. I was seriously considering getting a Dyson upright, but after seeing their disregard for customers as expressed in this handheld, I'll pass. You've lost a customer, Dyson."
1,I cannot believe they are still selling this thing,"The battery life stories are actually generous -- this is a complete ripoff in terms of usefulness. Actually, the battery life starts off low and goes down with time. I now have about 30 seconds of operation. The company, who makes great vacuums otherwise, could not give these things away."
1,phooey,"I am relieved to see others have had the same problems with battery life, but now mine has quit powering the unit all together. I bought it in March to keep a new car clean, and it worked okay if I worked fast. Now it shows that it's charged, but will not turn on at all. I was considering buying a Dyson floor model, but due to this fiasco I have doubts; it's a big investment and my experience so far is that it's not worth it."
1,Good looks but NOT practical,"When fully charged, lasts for 6 minutes only. Then you have to wait for 3 hours to recharge so you can use it for another 6 minutes. Not practical."
1,Horrible,"I am very upset with my new Dyson purchase and wish I could send it back. The problem is that the attachments are extremely hard to use and once they are attatched it decreases the sucking power by 95%. I would send it back, but I stupidly threw the box away."
1,Battery life is terrible,"Terrible! A great tool when and if it work, but battery life is miserable (3 minutes), charging takes forever (3 hours), battery longevity is suspect (and Dyson will charge you $75 for a replacement unit), and the charging station is a joke. You have to mount it on the wall in order for it to charge well. The lead engineer on this was Mickey Mouse."
1,Worst Ever!,This product is a waste of money and a waste of time! I am shocked that Dyson ever produced this item. The battery life is so short (3-5 minutes)that I called Dyson customer service to find out what I was doing wrong. What I did wrong was buy this item! The customer service rep informed me that it only has a 5 minute battery life. Why would any company build a vac with 5 minute suction??This was my first Dyson and makes me very hesitant to purchase any other Dyson product. DON'T BUY THIS ITEM!!
4,Great hand vac,"Besides looking like something from Star Wars, this vacuum is easy to use and easy to empty."
1,Do Not Purchase!,"For $140 this vacuum cleaner is absolutely not worth the purchase. It is not worth $10. I had the battery plugged in for days and was able to use 3 minutes before the battery ran out. The instructions say charge 3 hours for 6 minutes of use. Had I known that before I purchased this I wouldn't have bought it, but this information is left out of the description when viewing online. I have several Dyson products and was sure this would be a quality item. I was wrong."
1,I'd give it -5 stars if I could,"This is the most worthless item I've ever been stupid enough to buy!!! I charged it all night and the battery lasted less than a minute. The instructions manual has very few words, only pictures. (this should have been a clue to how stupid it is). I will give it one last try after another charging. If there is not a DRASTIC improvement in it's suction and battery life, it's going right back along with the attachments I was stupid enough to buy. I was under the (false) impression that Dyson made a quality product, so I decided to give it a try - NEVER AGAIN!!!"
3,Very good and very bad,"I've had a Root 6 since November, 2006. It sucks better than most cheap handhelds I've owned, some of which are almost useless. It feels pretty balanced and easy to use. If you had to use it for 20 minutes at a time, having to hold the button down could get annoying. Cleanup is fairly easy, though sometimes junk gets caught in the dustbin.But as everyone else has mentioned, battery life is horrible. I never tested it with a stopwatch, but initially it would last roughly five minutes. Now, it dies after about one minute. You better have a small job! This alone is enough to knock it down to 3 stars for me. Too bad."
2,Beware of Customer Service,"The product is good for quick cleaning - especially if you have a kid or pet at home. Battery can last upto 4 minutes on a charge. However, mine stopped working because of the battery in about 1 year. It would charge but not keep a charge longer than 15-20 seconds. I order a replacement battery online only to get my card charged by dyson but not get a battery after 3 weeks. I call c/s and they tell me its on the way...this is for 3 weeks. Finally I ask someone to look ""closer"". Guess what they cancelled my order! But never refunded my money. Long story short after 5 phone calls I still didnt get my money back so I'm going to the BBB."
2,Getting to the problem of the Root,"While others have noted that this vacuum works well (not superbly) for the 5 minutes the battery lasts, how many of your cleaning jobs are finished in 5 minutes? I would assume that many people envision using this for cleaning cars. You can vacuum one car on one charge if you rush. But you will wait hours to recharge before cleaning a second car. Even the relatively simple job of cleaning a sofa and a couple of chairs will use up most if not all of the battery charge.If you really have only 2 or 3 really small jobs on any given day (a minute or two in duration) then perhaps it will suit your needs. The price for those few minutes, however, seems unreasonably high.The short battery life is a major flaw for a product at this price. Dyson really ought to take this off the market and back to the drawing board."
2,Broke down after 1 month,"I received this as a Christmas gift and it totally broke down on January 29th.Won't suck at all...or perhaps I should it really sucks.Buy a proven technology, not some piece of junk that some goof ball invented in their basement."
2,Great vacuum for a year - 5 minutes at a time,"I guess saying this vacuum device ""sucks"" it too cliche' so I will avoid it. It actually sucks VERY well. The Darth Vader ray gun look will ensure the macho men in your family will use it and not be embarrassed. Since I got mine (and my home office is on the third floor) at least the stairs are always dust free. To be honest, I mostly use it to suck up the ""stink bugs"" which infest East Coast houses fall through spring. That is good because these charge just long enough to vacuum a flight of stairs or suck up a half-dozen unwitting stink bugs.Mine stopped holding a charge after about a year or so, and a replacement battery is something like 80 bucks. I'm not usually the kind of guy who spends two hundred bucks on a hand-vac. I am definitely not the kind of guy who does so two years in a row."
1,Save your money,"I have a dyson upright and love it. Normally, I would not spend $149 on a handheld but given my experience with the upright, I did. Battery life is so poor that I thought there had to be a defect in it. Nope, that just the battery life. Nothing else matters if it doesn't run long enough to pick anything up. I'm lucky if I get 5 minutes worth of running time. Don't waste your money, my dust buster does a better job."
4,Terrific Device,"Very portable and convenient for easy light clean up. My favorite go to vacuum device. Highly recommended but beware of reliability. The first one died after 2 years of use. Purchased a used one this time 2 months ago, so far so good."
2,It definitely sucked,"It lasted less than a year. Battery life was terrible, suction was adequate but not noticeably better than others we've tried. We expected better after having such a good experience with the Dyson upright.I have yet to find a hand vac that isn't a piece of junk. This one is no exception. Skip it and go with something cheaper."
4,Good but expensive,This vacuum works well. It is far superior to the other basic handheld models. My only issue is the cost. I feel it is too expensive for a handheld model.
1,Nearly Useless,"First let me say, that I am a mechanical Engineer who designs Electro-Mechanical products for a living. I know when something is well built, and when it is not.To sum it up, this product is nearly useless. 6 minutes of battery life for $150??? Are they joking??? My $79 DeWalt tools last hours!!! And the suction is not ""powerful"" compared to non-cordless handhelds; their advertising is misleading, it should say ""2x as powerful as other *cordless* vacuums"". We bought this item to vacuum one small 11 step carpeted stairway. The vacuum is so weak, that it takes major ""Scrubbing"" to get all the debris off the carpet; and because it takes so long to use, the battery dies before we can finish the job. This vacuum goes down as one of the most disappointing purchases I have made in 40 years. I am going to Target, to buy a $50 corded model..."
1,Disappointed,"Was hoping to use this for quick cleanups for my car or kitchen. I'm so disappointed in the battery life. Probably around 5-6 minutes of cleanup time before you have to recharge. You have to assume you need to cleanup small spills and dust. If only we could use the unit while it is plugged in to the wall. For the money spent, not worth it at all."
1,design more than function,"i was totally psyched about getting a dyson after seeing it on a documentary. this hand held has low suction, is noisy, battery life is not good. i am disappointed after using it, i mean it powers down before a filter might clog in another. it looks good but its bulky.i don't think its worth the price"
2,Waste of Money,"DYSON DC 6 HANDHELD I bought the Root 6 based on my experience with the 2 Dyson uprights I own, however was very disappointed. While the suction is great, the short battery life makes it worthless. 3 hours of charging for 4 minutes of use is not acceptable, it's big and heavy and you must keep finger on trigger to power which is uncomfortable and pinches the skin. I'm returning mine and bying a new dirt devil and saving myself $120."
4,Powerful and long lasting,"It does the job. It is very powerful and lasts much longer then the old Dust Buster we had. It is fairly large and the charging base is a bit awkward if you want to mount it somewhere, but we were able to find a suitable place without mounting.For those long cleaning sessions it would be nice if the trigger had a lock on switch."
1,"The battery stinks, and the company won't back it up.","I took my vacuum out of the box, charged it for two nights, and then started using it. The battery worked all of five minutes before it ran out of juice. Thought it was a fluke, so I tried it again. Same result numerous times. So I wrote to customer service at Dyson alerting them that the product was clearly defective. Their response? They forwarded my e-mail to engineering. That's right, after paying a premium price for a premium product, the company's response was to alert the folks who created an inferior product that mine didn't work. Stay away from this particular model, but more importantly, stay away from Dyson. Poor quality from product to customer service."
1,Dyson Root 6 DC16 Needs to go Back to the Drawing Board!,"This was the worst handheld ever - do not buy! The battery charge only lasts about 10 minutes before it has to go back on the charger for 2 hours - what a waste! As far as I'm concerned, this is a major defect in the design. What could Dyson possibly have been thinking when they designed this? The suction is good but what good is that if you can never use it for more than 5 to 10 minutes? They should have made it as a ""plug in"" to keep the power if this was the best they could come up with for a rechargeable!"
4,I like it!,"I'm quite happy with this dyson. The vacum, in my opinion, is meant for quick clean ups and has awesome suction. Never had an issue with the battery, as many reviews have mentioned, i've always used it briefly and used my full size dyson for regular cleaning.The design rocks the house and looks super cool.The onle design flaw i can comment on is the trigger. It looks cool and is a novel idea, but kinda annoying that it needs to be pressed at all times."
4,"Powerful, but very poor battery life - Customer Service though is EXCELLENT!","I guess there's a price to pay for the great power and that's 5 mins of battery life.Seriously, this is a great vacuum, but it is REALLY annoying as you just start to get into cleaning out those hard to reach places - the ones like on top of the wardrobe that the normal hoover can't reach - and the battery goes flat and you have to wait 3 hours for it to recharge! I would have tolerated a larger heavier battery for longer life.UPDATE 8/30/10Had problems with battery not holding charge for its FULL 5 mins : would shut off after 1 or 2 seconds. I phoned Dyson and within about 15 seconds the customer service agent knew the problem and sent out a new ""body"" to me - the design may be flawed, but the customer service is top-notch...now come on James, just improve the design and you're all set!"
3,"Great Spot Vacuum Cleaner, Battery Quality Crap","OK, I waited a year before posting this review so I can really use the product. This is great spot vacuum cleaner. I don't mind 5 minutes run-time. It is powerful and does great job vacuuming.But, the greatest problem is that battery starts losing its capacity after just 50 uses.In the beginning it used to run for 5 minutes. With less than 50 usage cycles it runs now only 3 minutes when fully charged. You can derive further deterioration from that.Battery quality is simply not up to the par and for that reason alone I would not recommend this product."
2,Dissapointed,"The handheld does a great job cleaning, however, I don't believe it states in the features that the maximum operating time when fully charged is 5-6 minutes. If it is in the info, we missed it. Bottom line, my wife loves it, but by the time she finishes the once over on the couch, it is out of juice. The unit needs an AC adapter to supplement the short operatiing time. If you plan on using it for quick pick ups you will love it, anything more intensive you may be dissapointed. It takes me more than 5 minutes to vacumn my car floor mats!"
3,battery life is an issue,"It is a shiny gadgety vac and I must admit that sucking up crumbs and dust is a quite bit more fun because of that. I bought one of these despite the reviews warning about battery life. I also thought that one would indeed use a bigger vac for jobs over 5 minutes, but boy, was I wrong! I have a small one bedroom apartment and amazingly 5 minutes aren't enough even for just a quick clean up. I ran out of power dusting some surfaces that can't be reached with a big vac or require a softer, more controlled touch. Having said that, I'm not entirely unhappy with my purchase. I now just consider it's shut-off time the perfect length for dusting duty... I'll do another 5 minutes tomorrow! Otherwise the thing works as advertised. Is it so much better than competitor's handhelds to justify it's steep price tag? I don't know. Decide what is important to you!"
2,never loses suction because it shuts off right away,I just received my new Dyson Root 6 last week. I was extremely dissappointed by the horrible battery life. I have cycled the battery a few times. Draining it and then charging it for 3 hours. It lasts less than 10 minutes per every 3 hour charge. I wouldn't spend $150 on just anything. This is a Dyson. I love my DC15. This is just unforgiveable. Its absolutely ridiculous. How much can you get done with a 6 minute battery life. I wish I would have read the reviews before blindly dropping a buck fifty on what was supposed to be a superior handheld. I want to speak to someone at Dyson about this. I have attempted to contact them and they won't reply. They should at least provide extra batteries or a way to keep extra batteries charged at all times.
2,Expensive Battery,"The product works well, but only runs for six minutes before the battery dies and needs to be recharged. The battery itself loses its ability to recharge after about a year and the replacement costs...wait for it...$75.00! The performance is good, but not so spectacular it justifies the price and expensive battery replacement cost."
1,very disappointing battery life,"i always had bad luck with handheld, so i figured that i'd spend $ and get a nice one once for all. what a mistake to pick Tyson! i was always frustrated that the device stopped midway my tasks, simple ones, such as cleaning highchair, stairs and car interior. now less than 2 years later after very gentle use, the battery simply last 1 second. I called Tyson service, they hinted that i didn't maintain it properly and i should pay $75 to buy a replacement battery. fortunately, I read these reviews here and realized that i didn't do anything wrong. i was debating if i should buy the replacement battery or buy something else, but now the decision is clear."
1,Bad warranty service,Dyson does not honor their warranties. Purchased a couple of dysons over the year. Always defective. Their service centers always insist that its not covered.
2,Useless,"I've owned several Dyson products and they've performed well. Except for this one. From day 1 it would not last more than five minutes. Now, it will not hold a charge and I've owned it less that a year. If you purchase this product after reading the reviews about battery life, you deserve what you get. Find another handheld vacuum to buy. This one is awful!!!!"
1,Complete Piece of Crap,"Based on our satisfaction with our Dyson upright we bought this handheld unit a year ago. 12 months later after very little use, the battery - which sucks to begin with (6 minute run time)now only runs for 60 seconds if we are lucky. Product is a complete rip off and a stain on Dyson's reputation. They should be ashamed of themselves for releasing something like this and charging $150 for it is the ultimate insult. You are essentially making a $150 donation to Dyson for a useless paperweight. Would not buy another one at any price. It has no electric option so it is dead weight when the battery stops and it will stop before you can even think about getting anything done with it."
2,way overpriced,This vacuum performs ok but is heavy and only lasts a few minutes before it has to be recharged. Most of my vacuuming jobs take more than a few minutes. For $150 this vacuum should be perfect and instead it's merely average.
2,A bummer for a Dyson lover,"I couldn't wait to get the Dyson Root 6 - I've had my Dyson DC 07 for 4 years and I LOVE it, so I figured the mini-version would be fantastic. I have 3 Dustbusters (one on each floor) and I was looking forward to the Dyson version, which I was convinced would be top notch.I'm so sorry to be wrong.First off, having to press the button continuously to make it work is a pain. And speaking of pain, the Root is so heavy and unbalanced - all the weight is in the back which puts a lot of strain on your wrist. I haven't noticed any difference in suction to a Dustbuster, but then again, I don't suck up bowling balls. A Dustbuster picks up lint and cat litter just as well.Save your money - this Dyson ain't worth it."
2,"Does not lose suction, but loses power almost instantly!","When I first heard that Dyson was going to make a hand unit, I was very excited, but excitement has turned into bitter disappointment as this product has failed to deliver on the most basic requirement: FUNCTION!It simply has terrible battery life, in fact its worse than my old Black & Decker products from five years ago. I think it lasts about FIVE MINUTES, even if that. In this age of iPods with 24 hour batteries and mobile phones that last over a week, you would think Dyson would have at least develop a battery that could last an average house cleaning of say one hour.Shame Dyson, shame."
4,"Very good vacuum, but pricey","The Root 6 is a damn fine hand held vacuum. It's well balanced in the hand, holds a charge well, provides good suction, and is much easier than a ""Dustbuster"" style vacuum to empty. Is it worth the price premium? Time will tell. It's held up well over its first two weeks of heavy use. Several drops from 3-4 feet in the air onto linoleum tile floor have left it none the worse for wear."
5,Great Product!!!!!!!!!,Best handheld I have ever owned. I have a Dyson Animal Upright and had hoped the handheld would be as good. It certainly do not disappoint.Highly recommend!!!!!!!
4,problem child,"I received the vaclum and it work after leaving it pluged in over night, when I tried to use the unit semed to work ok (I just tried it for a couple of minutes. Later in the week we needed to use it, so we unplugged it and it worked the first time I pulled the trigger but trying it again it ran for less then a secound. I went on line and tried the solution they gave ( did not go to dyson). the solution I got did not work. I ordered a nother moter (I paid for it because I screwed the first moter up). it worked the same way. I havent called dyson back yet. The only other thing it could be is the battry. I will call today to see what happens.I just talked to dyson and tried the unit while on the phone and it worked as advertised I don't under stand what happened but it works now and I have no complaints so I will give it 4 stars now because it works great if I have problems in the future I'll repost."
2,This seller is NOT an authorized Dyson seller. The warranty won't be honored by Dyson.,"I bought this item September of 2009. It has a 2 year warranty. In the last month the rechargeable battery does not keep a charge beyond 2 minutes. When I contacted Dyson they advised me that this seller bought this item from them in 2007 or 2008 and is NOT an ""authorized"" re seller. Therefore the 2 year warranty was null and void. I emailed the seller 4 days ago and have received no response. BEWARE OF THIS SELLER!!!"
1,TWO Dyson DC 16 Batteries won't recharge after only 10 days.,I purchased TWO Dyson DC 16 vacuums 10 days ago. BOTH of them have a faulty battery. Neither battery will recharge. The green charging light comes on for about 5 seconds then turns off leaving a dead battery. It's shocking that thess vacuums are still for sale as its obvious there is a huge problem with the batteries.
3,Not enough value for the money...,"The Dyson DC16 Root 6 Handheld has probably sold a lot of units due to the quality implied by the Dyson label. While their superb vacuums have a justified following, this miniature version doesn't make the grade. The $150 price doesn't generate enough valid reasons to purchase a unit that only works for a max of five minutes between charges. WHEN it is operational, however, the unit is wonderful.In this age of miniaturized manufacturing and microengineering, I am perplexed that the Dyson folks haven't upgraded the usage time on this device. It has been around for years, and I keep searching for the improved model. While you appreciate the convenience of size, shape and power, the 5-minute window is an insurmountable obstacle in a house with pets."
2,unhappy,Love Dyson and I got this little one in spite of the reviews. I shouldn't have!! Terrible Terrible suction---I don't use it long enough to know whether the battery dies!It picks up so little I have never had to clean out the container!!
4,Just the cutest little pink patent leather shoe....,"You could possibly own. I have a similiar to these in red patent leather from naturalizer and now this pair. Perfect with slacks, skirts,dresses."
4,it is a good cd,"I think that this is a good cd with the music of IZ, it has somewhat of a softer feeling to it."
1,You botched the order,My order was not delivered. The address was correct and things have been delivered many times before. Instead of contacting me to figure out what the problem was you sent me a message saying the order was put back in stock and for me to reorder. Don't bother me again.
5,Hawaiian for the World,"By pairing Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's timeless vocals with orchestral arrangements, producer Jon de Mello clearly seeks to continue the expansion of Hawaiian music's reach in the music industry and with music lovers throughout the world. He has succeeded mightily in allowing more listeners for whom Hawaiian music is an anachronism to appreciate the universal quality of Hawaiian music in general and Israel Kamakawiwo'ole in particular. Israel's voice has never sounded better and as he says, ""you'll never meet another Hawaiian like IZ""."
2,This is a train wreck.,"I just finished listening to the complete CD and did not notice it had ended. Over produced is one term that comes to mind. Orchestrated in bizarre parts throughout. The reviewer who called it ""The Little Mermaid"" type of music was correct. It just doesn't sound right. The simplicity of Iz and a ukulele on a white sandy beach was tied to the Disneyland Monorail and Goofy was the pilot. A disaster on the scale of Ishtar. Sometimes, shoes are not required.Iz is beautiful, but nothing new here. Don't waste your money. The two stars are for Iz, otherwise zero stars."
2,Very disappointing!,"I love Iz's music - if you do too - skip this CD. The orchestral arrangements are formulaic, weak and hokey. I was hoping there would be some innovative takes on the music - but it left a lot to be desired.If you like Yanni, John Tesh, or Muzak - by all means get this one.Otherwise - stick to the original cuts of these songs."
3,gowyo,"I was anxious to purchase this CD, after reading about the technology, etc., used to produce this CD. I like the overall quality of the product, but did not appreciate the fact that the ""Ahi wela"" verse was left out of ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star!"", the verse that all of us keiki Hawaiians heard from our mothers, and memorized as soon as we could sing. Also, leaving ""Somewhere over the rainbow"" out of ""Wonderful World"" in my opinion was a huge mistake. But I have the original versions of these songs, so I feel ok about the final product, notwithstanding the comments mentioned above."
2,orchestra,This album is too sugary. It is not authentic. It is like the orchestra repressed his soul and truth meaning of the songs.
1,Seriously...,What did I do to deserve this in my recommendations? Was it that foolish purchase in a drunken stupor of those Don Ho albums so long ago? The Zamfir tapes? The Peruvian flute music?
1,:(,"I don't like it a bit. The orchestration took away its island flair. I only played it twice, the 2nd time for the benefit of the doubt. The first one to email me ([...]) and willing to send me a SASE CD mailer will get it free."
3,It was GOOD but not WONDERFUL,"I have almost all of IZs albums and that's the reason I bough this one. It was then, that I realized that it was ""arranged"" with a big orchestra. I guess it is OK to listen to because his voice and the orchestrations are nice on their own, but I'm not crazy about it because I cannot think they necessarily go toghether well. It is probably just me, but I like his voice and his ukalele sound much better. It is still GOOD, don't get me wrong...but it's just my preference. But I loved the presentation...the cover is beautiful!"
3,Disappointed,"I was distracted in the store and failed to read the part about the orchestra on the back cover so this is mostly my own fault, but I am disappointed with this.The orchestra takes away from the beautiful simplicity of the music. There are quite a few times when a bass will be plucked while IZ is singing and it takes me right out of the moment. Also, the promotional video (as another reviewer stated) led me to believe that another version of White Sandy Beach was on this cd.It's not terrible, but not up to the original versions I've heard elsewhere."
2,Flimsy-But works,"When I received the item, it was packaged in a regular manilla envelope. Needless to say, it was slightly bent when it was received. It is very flimsy as I was afraid to straighten it out for fear that it may break. It will work for now until I can locate something more durable. This definitely cannot be washed. It is a throw away product once it has met its use."
1,"Missing, and broken items","I ordered 2 Broan #BP57 Hood-filters from Grady's Hardware, but I actually got only ONE of them and it was BENT and broken at middle of one of its sides.Because I filled out a claim to Grady's Customer Service after 5 business days from the day I received the damaged and missing items, so I did not have any replacement for what I ordered. It was Okay to me.. but I am just wondering why Grady's sent me only ONE ITEM and charged me for TWO!? And, why they sent out to their customers via the Post Office something soft and easy to bend like those Al-hood-filters without any hardcover to protect it?Very disappointed with Grady's!"
2,Damaged upon Receipt,"The item arrived bent because it was packed poorly, sitting at the bottom of a box with many other items on top of it. It's lightweight metal, so it doesn't bend back into place without noticeable bend marks.Since it's installed, it's not worth the hassle of returning. It's just disappointing that Amazon fulfilled my order so poorly, even with several existing customer feedback remarks about this item being damaged from bad packaging.I, myself, read the feedback before purchasing and decided to take the chance. It's such a hard-to-find item and I'm glad Amazon carries it. Oh well, another customer gets a damaged item."
4,Great Book,This is a great book for any person interested in the craft. It has a a ton of good info and even some good spells. Kate West did a really good job on this book.
3,Book for Children,"I'm not a Wiccan but interesting in this religion, so I brought several books about this. When I went throught ""The Real Witches Handbook"", I have a feeling that being treated as a child, ie. Ms. West Wrote a lot of passages to clarify what the witches do. Moreover, it's too simple, not covering all the topics in details. Recommend for those what to have a quick glance in Wicca."
1,Great if your wiccan....,"I was very unhappy with this book. If your wiccan, great, you'll just love it. If your a trad witch, save your money."
2,Only for beginners,"I suppose this book would be well-liked by Wiccans - and Wiccan beginners at that - looking to follow the Path, so to speak, but for more independent pagan practicioners or even more experienced Wiccans, this book is virtually useless. Also I was not impressed by the amount of traditional practice in this book. In today's rapidly urbanizing world where many pagans can't get out of the city into an enchanted forest, it's impossible to do many of the things she writes of, like nature walks and picking up certain natural items. I would have liked to see something more practical."
4,Get your terminology straight! Wicca vs. Witchcraft,"Ok, so alot of witches are Wiccans too. does that mean that EVERY witch follows the Wiccan Rede?It looks like the author of this book was trying to convince me that everything about a Witch is Wiccan, without explaining what Wicca is, and how it differs from Witchcraft.There are very few good books today that their authors know the diffrence between a Witch and a Wiccan Witch. BUT... The book is still ok..It's a GREAT book to gap the distance betwwen learning the theory, and actually practicing. I found in that book alot of good things to think about, and some suggestions for rituals (though I'll have to change them to suit my belief system).I was disapointed to see that there is no mention of witches like me, who are not Wiccan, but than again - I'm not sorry I bought this book."
5,Collectors will cherish this one,"June Christy fans will find this album indispensable. Five tracks were recorded in 1957 when June was in her prime. Five more were recorded in 1965.While these tracks do not have the elaborate orchestration of her Capitol recordings, the pared down arrangements reveal what a great singer she was.The sound quality lacks bass, but overall it is quite acceptable.This will be a valuable addition to any collection for people who love June Christy."
1,This Kindle version is not good,"It has many, many typos and does not display well. I am much happier withThe Catechism of the Council of Trent (1566), which looks better and fixes those errors. Try the free samples and you can see the difference."
1,A Dud,"I purchased this remanufactured toner and put it on the shelve. Later when I installed it, it printed worse than than the one I just removed. After running about 15 sheets of print (I was hoping it would start printing normally) it wasn't getting any better. When I tried to return it for a replacement, I found out I only had 30 days to do so, and the time had expired. I feel cheated. I have to give this one star. I would give it zero stars if possible. Don't buy from this company!"
2,Psychoanalysis + Yoga = Emotional Clearing,"If Freud were a proponent of yoga, many more people would be doing ""Emotional Clearing"" these days. The idea of discovering and re-experiencing highly emotional memories to ""cleanse"" the brain of the repressed emotion is not new. And yoga has been around forever (I'm pretty sure cavemen did yoga).I appreciate Ruskan's idea and his ability to articulate it, but I'm also a bit wary of his dogmatic adherance to one form of therapy, especially when he starts recommending against antidepressants because they ""block off emotions for clearing"". He begins to sound less like an accepting eastern meditator on emptiness and more like a puritanical westerner who sees pain as the only passage to happiness. Wouldn't it be better to spend our time cultivating good emotions and accepting the presence of the bad ones, as opposed to frantically cleaning house?"
4,"Worth it for ""Live at the Albert Hall"" alone","This is a two-part set. ""Archive"" has been available on CD since the mid-90's and is a reasonably well-done collection of Webb's notable work. ""Live at the Albert Hall"" as an addition is an amazing concert.Most of Webb's repertoire for this concert is standard fare. The commentary between songs is great. Webb's description of writing ""Didn't We"" and flunking out of music school is hilarious.And he does do some out of the way tunes you won't encounter elsewhere. Webb does ""Pocket Full of Keys"" which appeared on ""Sunshower"", which was a 70's collaboration between himself and Thelma Houston and as part of a Boston Pops concert featuring Glen Campbell doing Webb songs.The big surprise (or shock to some) is Webb doing a Frank Zappa song, ""My Guitar Wants to Kill Your Mama."" It's twisted and well done."
5,Can't I give it more than 5 stars?,"Of the three volumes in this series now available on Vanguard Classics CDs (Vol. 3 has just been issued), this is by far not only the best but possibly the best recording ever made of this material. Kunz has simply the incredibly right voice for the satire of some of the songs and the beauty of the others.Yes, you will recognize Brahms' ""Academic Festival"" opening in the first track; and it is so good hear the second stanza of ""Gaudiamus igitur""! I played my LP version of this until it became unlistenable; and then spent years looking through used LP bins for decent copies. It is so good to have this now on (theoretically) infinitely playable CDs. Grab this one, please.My CD does not have the German texts, only the English translations. The other two sets give both."
5,Good book for students,It is a good book for students who want to get into the caregiving field. Very easy to understand and easy to prepare for the exam. Good book.
3,necessary but...,"I just ordered my fifth worm. If you have a Rabbit corkscrew then you will need a replacement worm eventually, and this item fits the bill perfectly. Just be warned that *all* of my previous worms have failed by bending so badly that they could not be removed without cutting. So you might want to invest in a pair of 18"" bolt-cutters or a Dremel tool with some cut-off wheels.Or just buy one of these:Campagnolo Big Corkscrewin the first place. I've had mine for 20 years and it's still going strong. When the Rabbit fails, the Campag always works."
5,It makes the RABBIT work as it should!!,At one time we LOVED our RABBIT wine opener but after a few years it became almost impossible to open a bottle of wine. We complained and complained but never did anything about it until last month when we ordered a new WORM. It now works like a charm.
4,Typical purchase,This fit my rabbit and was simple to install. This is a typical purchase for me for I tend to be lazy in going shopping or hate going out and not finding what I need. So basically this is an example of a purchase by me and why I am a prime member!
3,"Good, but not great","The worm on the Rabbit has twice been squashed by the effort of pushing the worm into a cork. The first time seemed like a freak accident, but the second time? Admittedly, the second time was a plastic cork, so maybe the Rabbit worm isn't made to breach those ... but artificial corks are not as uncommon as they once were, and the product description doesn't say ""beware of artificial corks."" So here I am plumping down $20 for two new worms, which is about twice what a normal corkscrew costs. What price vanity? I guess $20 is as cheap as it gets when it comes to nifty wine gadgets."
4,Saved money,This replacement part prevented us from having to buy a new corkscrew. Easy to replace.I cannot believe there is a minimum number of works required for a review.
5,Fit my rabbit corkscrew,I bought this to replace the screw on my rabbit corkscrew purchased at Costco a few years ago. The screw worked fine and easily screwed into the cork and pulled it right out of the bottle.
2,Not as good as original,Not sure what the problem is but it takes 2 to 3 tries into any type of cork to get this to work. Original was much better. Will be contacting manufacturer.
1,notably bad,"This is the worst DVD I have seen in a long time. Heston is either flat or angry. Battle scenes poorly executed. I grew tired of watching the actors squint in the sun. Don't waste your time or your money.Considering that the glorious Cleopatra with Taylor and Burton was filmed about a decade earlier, I have to wonder why these folks even attempted this film."
3,A helpful book but not to the OCP Exam,"I do not recommend this book for OCP exams. However, if you are serious about the OCP and are new to Oracle, you can use this book as a starting point, you definitely need to take some CBT or Instructor lead courses. I was completely new to Oracle and was able to pass 4 exams in 3 months(will take one more this week) just by reading this book and take CBTS.( CBTs is more important for exams)."
1,Incomplete and incorrect,"I bought this because it was the authorized Oracle Press exam guide. I now know that coming from the Oracle Press is no guarantee of quality.The book could easily be half as long (so much filler, so little actual content), which would have made it possible to print the Oracle8i upgrade review sections - instead of just putting them on the CD-ROM in HTML (no, no PDF version).Basically, this is just a rip-off. Avoid it. Your hundred bucks is better spent on selftestsoftware's review questions."
1,Very disappointing,"This weak effort at a tutorial misses the mark. The examples are mindless, and the book is filled with errors.Considering how many excellent DBA books are on the market, I recommend buying something else - or better yet, a couple of something elses. But don't waste your money on this doorstop."
2,VERBOSO MAXIMOSO,"THE BOOK IS EXTREMELY LONG, WORDY AND TEDIOUS READING if you already know Oracle. Jason Couchman must have been paid by the word! Remember when you were in school and had to write a 1000 word essay so you added as many fluff words as you could to make the minimum length? That's the way it reads. I guess if you don't already know Oracle it could be OK to help the reader understand some of the basic concepts but it's very tedious if you already have a working knowledge of Oracle and that's what you should have if you're going for certification. Just give me the ""Cliff Notes"" with lists I can commit to short term memory. The best test scores are achieved by cramming and this book is not cram material."
3,Want to become a OCP or a DBA Pro ?,"When I first browzed through the book, I found not much material. But when I actually started studying for OCP, I found a lot of material hidden in tons of running text. One has to be very carefull in reading and catch all the important points.I first read the book, then took some 200 practice questions in each unit, then read the book again. Only the second time I found that most of the material needed for OCP is covered.Which DBA in the world needs to know about Clustering ? But Questions are asked about it in the exam.I thinks this book is 7 in 10 as far OCP concerns. Lacks pointwise presentation and very deficient in practice questions which will actually stimulate you to the loads of running text."
1,Can not pass exam with this book,"I compared this book with the actual Oracle training books (that the exams are based off, the ones given in the Oracle Instructor Lead Class) and Jason's book clearly does not cover the subject well enough to pass the exam"
1,Couldnt even pass free practice exam,I tried to using the book to pass the free practice exam from the Oracle website and the book didnt even cover or properly prepare you for half of exam. This book in no way prepares you for the OCP exam. Do not waste your money.
1,Disappointed,I am disappointed to learn that the second edition of this book is no better. I bought the first one and it was a complete waste of money.
1,Incredibly bad,"I thought that since the first (awful) edition of this book had been out for a while, it would be improved when they updated it for Oracle 8. Nope. Same rambling approach, same irrelevant exercises, same lack of understanding how people learn. Yeesh.C'mon, Oracle Press, get someone better on this!Potential buyers: Read the Oracle DBA docs from beginning to end, and you will get a much better education than you will from this collection of half-baked ""explanations""."
2,Sloppy abet useful piece of work,The book is ok. Not great but certainly useful. Wish the author and publisher would have read the book atleast once before printing it. Way too many silly mistakes in the book and discrebencies even between the book and CD that comes along with it.
1,Waste of trees,The information on the Oracle CD-ROM is more complete and more accurate. And it's free.
3,Good substitute for Manuals,The contents covered in this book are quite focussed to exam requirements. Two-minute drills at the end of each chapter are helpful when constrained for time. TIPs can be used in day to day DBA support. Experienced DBAs looking for certification can gain maximum from this book.
4,Improvement,"Jason has done a better job in this edition than the first. There are still some errors that I have found. This book is the next best thing as compared to the official Oracle course material. Used together, the materials are a powerful combination. The book clears up some of the difficult concepts presented in the Oracle course material, though there could be more practice questions for the exams. Good luck to everyone!"
4,Will get you 75 to 80 percent of the way there but...,"This is really a great and concise way to learn Oracle and to prepare yourself for the exams, but I have found that without ordering the practice tests that I may have not passed some tests (I would have come close but not quite). Some items appearing in the practice tests and on the exams were not covered, although for such a huge topic Couchman does very well. I still recommend this book to other future DBAs but also recommend the tests. I have passed the first 2 tests so far on the first try (the second scoring a 56/63) so the book does work, just use the practice tests to make sure you have all the facts."
1,USE AT YOUR OWN RISK,I am an experienced Oracle DBA who is using this book to close any gaps in my own knowledge prior to taking the exams. I found this book full of typographical errors and contradictions. I feel that this book did not receive a technical review and therefore do not feel that this book is even worth half of the publisher's asking price. Please use OTHER material when preparing for the OCP exams; this book has too many inaccuracies.
1,Want to fail? Buy this book.,Errors everywhere. Insufficient depth. There is no way this book can prepare you to pass the DBA exams.
5,Three Great Christian Biographies,"I received this book from a colleague of mine almost one year ago, and it is part of a Piper series called The Swans are Not Silent. I regularly read, listen and watch Piper's sermons, interviews and books, and once again I was not disappointed. The Roots of Endurance is the third book of five in this series, and the lives of three Christ-loving men are examined. I had some knowledge of the lives of Newton and Wilberforce prior to reading this book, but The Roots of Endurance gave me a better understanding of the battles they often faced and the God who carried them through it all. I probably enjoyed reading about Charles Simeon the most. I knew virtually nothing of the man and reading about the hardship he faced preaching at his own church is an example of suffering for Christ that more should hear. I think I would very much enjoy reading other books in this series, particularly Piper's book on Augustine, Luther and Calvin."
2,Incorrect material in a well organized format,"Although the vocabulary is mostly correct, a native Mexican speaker in my 317 class commented that many words are rather irrevelant to everyday conversation.The grammar sections are mostly accurate but presented in a format more difficult to follow than I have seen in other texts.The danger is in all the mistypings, incorrect grammar usages and regionally variable vocabulary interspersed within the accurate information. Too many times the professor asked us to please disregard this word or that sentence, and she often expressed frustration with the book, which makes me wonder why she asked us to use it in the first place.The bottom line is there are plenty of good books out there that do a better job."
3,Spanish text book,"Typical college text book. Not much in the way of expectations. Book was intact, which was really the only requirement. Satisfactory. Thanks."
3,Not as good as they say...,I took an advanced Spanish class at the University level this semester. This was the book required for that class...The only good thing in this book was the vocabulary after each chapter. It lists different words and it's synonyms. But the grammatical lessons in this book were truly worthless. The exercises provided here were not too good. Even my professor said that they weren't good. Since there was a change in professor after the second week of school...she couldn't go back and ask us to buy new books when we had already bought this one. So she instead wrote up exercises on her own and we practiced this way. If it's required to have this book...I suggest to buy a spanish grammar review book to complement this book. Something like the ultimate Spanish Review for intermediate and advanced learners. Otherwise...I'd go for a better book.
4,Works well,I've used several of these and only had one that wasn't just right. It would smear after many copies so I had to clean it with a q-tip. Overall the batting average is great. Saved a lot of money.
1,Buyer Beware,"Very poor quality cartridge, leaked ink straight from the box. No refund or replacement as yet, nor communication from the seller after I returned the cartridge (at least 14 days now). Look out for these guys."
1,would not recommend this product,"you get what you pay for is the old saying right? well I ordered 2 of these and both are not so good, I would go as far as saying terrible and horrible. I colores are not vibrant, and solid like if you had bough brand new cartridges. I am getting the same results like you would get if you were running low on ink. Not Happy with this product."
1,"""color cartridge(57)has failed"" one week","Had this cartridge for less than one week and then got this error ""color cartridge(57)has failed"" on the display of my HP Photosmart 7760. Money ($15.43) down the drain. Using whats left of the old cartridge different brand.. Unless you have money to waste never buy from Databazaar. I can't afford to give them a second chance and have it turn out the same way."
4,Okay so far,"I have no complaint with the product. Unfortunately it's not one of those items you can make an overall judgment on for some time. So are it's delivered good ink copies. As for the next important point, longevity, that will have to wait."
5,Liszt Mephisto Waltz,"The Mephisto Waltz performed here is Mr. Wild's own edition, and (to me) its more successful than Liszt's original. There are some small textual changes within, plus the added very effective closing cadenza. For years this frustrated pianists who were trying to find the score, which I came to find out wasn't available until recently when Schirmir published two volumes of Liszt's works edited by Earl Wild. And the recording itself? Better than anyone else's! Buy this CD just for this track!"
2,Can't use as intended,"I bought this product because the top was larger than most of the competitor's houses (which tend to slope in and have a small top). I wanted my rabbit to be able to stretch out on top. However, so much of the corner is cut away for the entry that the house tips over if she tries to jump on top."
3,My prairie dogs ate this in a week...,"It's a great little house, but I'm afraid that the plywood used is so soft and easy to tear apart that my three prairie dogs were able to chew this house to its ""foundation"" in like 7 days."
3,This wasn't that good,Truthfully this sucked.Four-way tagchamps match:6-10I give it this just because of booka nd goldieKane vs. Batista:2-10This was too quick and boring and not hardcoreEdge vs. A-train:4-10At this point I started having doubtsChris Benoit vs.Eddie Guerrero:3-10BoringWomen's Championship match:SuckedBig Show vs. Kurt Angle:2-10I don't like smackdown and this didn't helpShawn Micheals vs.HHH:7-10Liked it because of the 2-3 falls part. Otherwise I didn't like the ending.
2,guess what kurt angle did,kurt angle carried his bald head and carried big show 2 a quite entertainin match and won da wwe title with da help of brock lesnar isn't that great or what then we have da good technical match between benoit vs guerrero that i thought could have been a little but for what it gave us i wasn't 2 disappointed and 2/3 falls between hhh and hbk match was good don't get me long but was a little bit 2 long for my liking they tried how 2 make this match special good but not as good as their summerslam 2002 match up together
3,not that good,this was no where near as good as i hoped it would be1st)fatal fourway tag team championship-3/5 not as much action as i was hoping for2nd)edge vs a-train-2/5 would have been so much better if it were no dq3rd)kane vs batista-2/5 way to slow should not have been on the card4th)chris beniot vs edde guerrero-5/5 great match but they were even better at vengeance 035th)triple threat womens title-3/5 could have been a great match if it were longer and without the cheating from victoria6th)big show vs kurt angle-3/5 this was pretty much a squash match because big show just destroyed angle for most of the match well till the end ne way with help from brock7th)2 out of 3 falls match-5/5 this was the best match on the card but thats not much to brag about i wouldve like to seen more blood and more use of the barbed wire and it shouldve been alot longer the cage and the ladder matches it wouldve made em better all in all not really worth your money except for 2 or 3 matches23/35
2,Not a very good pay per view with one exeption,"This was a bad wwe event and i am going to give reviews on all the matches.1) 4 way elimination for the tag titles- a good opener, it was good when it got down to the last two teams **3/42)Edge vs a train- yet again the wwe push the a train yet again he lets us all down, poor match *1/23)Chris benoit vs eddie- this was the one exeption i was talking about a great example of mat wrestling a close to its best ****1/44) Kane vs Batista- nothing to say apart from RUBBISH. DUD5) victoria v trish v Jaquie for the womens title- a bad match nothing else to be said. *6)wwe title Kurt Angle vs The big show- oh my God Kurt can carry anyone to a half decent match, the was ok and the right man came out on top. **7) HBK vs HHH- i cannot understand people giving this ***** it was 40 minutes of boring wrestling, missed spots golore and 1 good bump by michels to finish it. An awful main event. *1/2"
3,An ok show.,The HBK vs. HHH match was once again amazing. HBK should be wrestling every pay per view. All the other matches are forgettable.
2,Triple H ruins yet another wwe pay-per-view,"This event further proves the theory that Triple H is the biggest ego maniac to ever step in a ring. Triple H again puts himself over at a pay per view and has a 2 star match with Shawn Michaels in a match that never shouldve been given over 30 minutes! Triple H shouldn't have even been wrestling, as his knee was banged up and he has trouble doing any moves at all. Triple H has yet to let any of the younger stars go over him. The rest of the card is a run of the mill house show type event. The only exception is Kurt Angle FINALLY being given a run as the WWE champion with a win over the Big Show. Kurt was so misused in 2002 though that the win does little for his career. This event is not worth going out the way to purchase or for that matter, even to rent. Only purchase if you are a fan of Kurt Angle, as the rest of the card is HORRIBLE."
4,A very good WWE PPV,"The four-way tag-team title match was good, especially when it came down to the final two teams. Edge vs. A-Train was nothing special. Chris Benoit vs. Eddie Guerrero was a classic and on eof the best matches of 2002. Kane vs. Batista was dull, but Ric Flair makes it entertaining when he loses it because his punches don't hurt Kane. The triple-threat women's title match was as good as a women's match can get. The WWE Tilte match between Kurt Angle and Big Show was a great match with a great ending. Finally, the 2 out of 3 falls with HBK and HHH was a brutal main event that really showcased these two wrestlers abilities to put on a show at a major event."
5,Original recordings...hallelujah,"It's tough to find Sheb Wooley (Ben Colder) original recordings. But this one gives you a good selection of them. Not all, but a great sampling. Throw in the original versions of the classic country hits Sheb parodies, and you've got one great disc of music AND comedy."
3,"Great costume, poor construction","This costume got lots of laughs. But the blow up legs only lasted one night and developed two holes that leaked out all the air. The costume is a tight fit also. I'm a small guy (5'6"" 160 lbs) and I barely squeezed into it. Also needs a better looking old lady mask, the one it comes with is really cheap looking."
4,Great But!,"I received the costume without the bonnet! Would have to return the whole costume, can't get a replacement for the bonnet!Otherwise, It would be a great find! Now I have to find a bonnet!"
1,Holy inflatables,"Everything mentioned was included in the costume kit and looked as advertised. However, both the inflatable parts of the costume had holes in them upon arrival. They were not fixable!"
1,Piece of junk,"This costume was funny but very poorly made. My son wore it for 1 hour. I would not hold air in either place. It was received with a hold in one part which we patched but it still wouldn't hold air and we couldn't find any holes in the other piece that would not hold air. The ""mommy"" part kept falling apart. The clothing pieces were cheap and wouldn't stay on correctly either and the mask wasn't very realistic. It was VERY disappointing. We had to go out on the day before Halloween as a result to buy another costume."
1,Very shabby,The dummy or plastic portion of the costume started coming apart at the seams and the air leaked out. I started putting air into it and it leaked all over. i had to finally stuff it with socks. For the price it was horrible and not worth it. The idea of the costume was very good though.
3,"Imaginative, but overwrought","Five stars for a wonderfully imaginative premise, but docked one star for turning into another ""oh-no-it's-the-end-of-the-universe"" story, and docked another star for canonizing the characters."
3,passtime papp,"These books, which date from the period when fans had to wait for a film every 2 years, are kind of filler fixes for hardcore ST fans. They only very rarely would stand on their own as scifi novels, relying instead on a stock set of characters and a predictable formula.In this one, there is an arachnoid scientist who has a new technology to test. Something goes awry, of course, but by the end the Enterprise crew has (literally) saved the day, reconciled some alien cultures who were blood enemies, and revealed the beauty of their souls. All's well that ends well. This is nice to read if you don't have the option of the actual show (I was going to say the ""real thing""!), but it is just a way to pass the time. Recommended as such."
2,Ok,"Well, it isn't the best Trek book I ever read. I found myself skipping/scanning over parts just to get through it. Still it was Trek, so it was an ok read."
3,Technically confusing,"Even as an avid TOS fan, I thought this story was too technical and repetitive. I also feel it wandered too far off the deep end (so to speak). Story without all the constant theorizing would have been more effective."
5,Now THIS is real Star Trek!,"Diane Duane has always been a favorite of mine for both her believable characters and wondrous dialogue... and this is beautifully showcased with a powerful and thought-provoking story. Just about every one of her novels that I have read has given me shivers at some point in the story, and this one is no exception, even with multiple readings. The only problem I have with this book is that a lot of other ""Trek"" novels fall far short of the standard of this one, and the movies are disappointing too. I wish that the screenwriters could ask for her assistance with dialogue at least...."
1,Pure garbage.,"I cant understand how this tripe garnered good reviews from other readers! it is disjointed, fails to lay an articulate foundation, weakly wanders around a ""plot"", fails to develop characters both new and known, and is insulting! The crew finds God, no wait! They find a raceof protoGods. No wait! Let's teach them about life and creation! Kirk is so awesome he teaches God about being God! Rediculous, insulting, boring, and dissapointing all at once. I haveread hundreds of Trek books, and a few by Ms Duane. i have seldomly hated a book this much, and never before a Trek book. avoid this drivel if you are looking for a good read. Trek books are not meant to be spirtual self help books andshould not try."
1,worst star trek book ever,"This is probably one of the WORST Star Trek books I have ever read. The 'technotalk' is more unreal than in Voyager, the characters don't act like themselves...a glass spider???? where is that even remotley hinted at or reffered to in Star Trek 'canon' ?? I have read this book 3-4 times...and each time I come away wondering...why? why did I read it again? I should burn the damn thing! A waste of money and a waste of time..."
2,Great Premise Fizzles,"The book starts out with a terrific premise - the idea of using an ""inversion drive"" to travel through de Sitter Space to travel extraordinary distances. Extra-galactic travel would be possible, for instance. One third of the way through the book is a Klingon ambush that I wish would have been more developed, but was nevertheless very exciting.Midway through, however, the story begins to rely heavily on fantasy sequences that are happening in the minds of the crew. A little bit of this is okay, but by the end, the story is dominated by it. That was very disappointing, and didn't have much of a science-fiction feel to it. For that reason I can't recommend this book."
2,The wounded Story,"For those of us who enjoy a page-turner with the action running thick and fast thru complex plot twists, this book is NOT for you. The book is bogged down in detail and trivia which seems to take precedent over the predictable story line. I found myself speed-reading in order to skip the pages of detail and background that mostly do not add to the plot. However after saying all this if you are a reader who thrives on detail, then if with a predictable plot, you will probably find this book a pleasant read as the detail, rather than the plot, is quite complex."
4,Great Book,"This book is very helpful for understanding and interpreting how the different schools of art in different countries contributed to the Renaissance. Very good information, and the pictures of the artwork are in good color and large for easy viewing."
5,a music fan,"Good album. I was glad that this was one of the few good albums I bought this year. The whole group comes correct on they songs. Backbone and Big Rube are my favorites. If you listened to them on solo projects, you will like them on this album. They be kickin some real knowledge on that one song about rap. go get it."
3,Some things some don't,I Like some of the music on here.I dig the Vibe&Arrangements also the Production has good moments but on a whole something seemed to be missing for me.I've heard so much from all of the crews over the Years so it on a whole didn't really knock me out.this is Cool for Rap but Please they ain't nowhere in the same League as George Clinton&Parliament Funkadelic.you gotta do a whole lot more to match that Level&depth.but this is a cool Set that works well on the Floors.but the Rappping&Stylings don't really do much for me on a whole.but the music is cool in spots.
2,This is the edited version!,"If you like radio edits this is the one but, if your looking for what the artist actually intended you'll have to look elsewhere!"
4,Makes Me Glad To Be An Atlanta Native,"The only reason I didn't go the full 5 stars is because Dre should have been on more songs, to really tie the album together. But that aside, this is a fantastic album. It's all here: knowledge, skills, and relaxation. The production is stellar. The standouts are ""Follow The Light"", ""What Is Rap"", ""6 Minutes"", ""Trans DF Express"", and arguably the best Bubba Sparxxx verse thus far on ""White Gutz"". The album blends a lot of 70s vibes, urban break beats, and subtle modern electronica, all with the southern soul that only the 'DF' can bring.This makes me very happy to know that the South and Atlanta, where I dwell, isn't all about sickening rah rah music. At least a few individuals down here have their minds on HIP HOP ELEVATION."
4,P-Funk's legacy lives on,"I have been a rabid Outkast fan since ATLiens (aside from the fantastic 'Southernplayalistic..' track, I didn't really dig Dre & Big Boi's first CD) and like fine wine, they grow better with time. Constantly improving and successfully experimenting with hiphop in ways that very few artist would dare, Outkast has shown, better than anyone else in the industry, that the soul and passion of George Clinton & P-Funk's legacy lives on. This album is yet another example of their brilliance. Tracks like ""Crooked Booty"" & ""Follow the Light"" merge 70's funk with modern hiphop and southern bounce effortlessly. And who could compliment Outkast without giving equal praise to Goodie Mob. Throughout the album, Goodie Mob continue to prove that they are one of rap's premiere groups and capable of getting anybody off their butt and bumpin.If you're a fan of either group then ""Even in Darkness"" is a must-buy."
5,Real music,"True music. Rap music. For once, that phrase is not an oxymoron. One of the most original CD I've ever heard. But it does not sound like they are trying to be different. They just are. I lost this CD, and I went and bought it again. That's how good it is. This CD is ahead of its time. That's good, that's makes for decades of listening.Rollin' is the best track of the year. Cee-Lo don't mess around on this CD."
4,This Album Is A Must Have!!!,"If you own anything that the Dungeon Family has released in the past, then this album is a must-have. IMO, this has been a pretty disappointing year for hip-hop, but this album renewed my faith. I liked Stankonia, but as of yet, I am feeling this album a little more. My favorites are Crooked Booty, Follow The Light, On&On&On, 6 Minutes, Excalibur and Rollin'. The production on this album is some of the best that I have heard all year. IMO, the Dungeon Family is one of hip-hop's most innovative crews and they continue to push the envelope on this album. If you don't add this album to your collection, you will definitely be missing out on one the year's best albums."
4,Great CD!,I'd heard so much about Paula Robison so I was really excited about getting this cd. I would recommend this to any serious flute player or music patron. Her interpretations of the Carmen Fantasy and the Dutilleux Sonatine are the definite highlights.
5,Perfect!,"I bought this for my twelve year old son to use for his Jedi Halloween costume and it turned out to be perfect. I did have to take about three inches off the bottom because it was too long, but that was easy with a simple trim. My son is 5'4."
3,Why are the DVD sets so expensive?,"I loved watching ""Dr.Quinn Medicine Woman"" when it was airing on TV. I realy want to get the seasons on DVD, but I don't understand why they are so expensive (compared to ""Little House on the Prairie"" or ""The Waltons"" DVD sets)!"
5,Will the Dr. Quinn series ever be Closed-Captioned and/or subtitled in English?,"I have enjoyed the DQ series a lot, but I have noticed that the DVD versions are not Closed-Captioned nor at least have any English subtitles.My question is will they ever be re-mastered to included Closed-captioningor English subtitles?"
5,<3 Dr Quinn!,"Loved a kid, and still love today! I only wish there were more seasons available with Prime! Just a wonderful family friendly show!!"
2,Serious sound issues!,"This review goes for seasons 1 and 2 (and I don't know how many others--maybe all of them?) of this show. I love love love the show. (Hence the 2* review and not 1*!) However: 1) There are no closed captions! 2) They ""sound compressed"" the audio (or something like that), and I have to blast the volume all the way up to hear it! Combining both factors, I can't watch the show without dredging out my old hearing aids. Wearing them at home drives me crazy! Well, craziER. ;-) Then I STILL miss some important dialogue!!! I really don't think there's any excuse in this day and age to not include the captions! Please re-release this whole series, and get it right!!!"
4,Dr. Quinn - Season 1,Dr. Quinn is a nice family series to watch. If you like mid 1800's stories and can tolerate a little righteous attitude from Dr. Quinn you'll like this set of DVDs.
4,A thought-provoking and entertaining show,"Dr. Quinn is just a fun and decent show to watch. The DVD sets are great except most of the episode descriptions don't match up with what actually happens in the episode. Not a big deal, just odd.I would definitely recommend this set."
5,Dr. Quinn Season 1,Dr. Quinn Season 1 is fabulous. I never got to see the beginning and it is wonderful to see where it all began and how some of the characters have changed over the seasons. The DVD came quickly after I ordered it and in great condition. Plan on ordering the other seasons as well!
5,Roger's response,"I love all the dr. quinn episodes, they are awesome, just wished there had been more, like the soap operas, for instance, I watch them also on youtube online, but can't get all the episodes, and it's frustrating, but in time n finances we're going to own the whole series, ; thumbs up on every episode!"
3,CC,does not have close caption so i wouldnt recommend to deaf people. But other than that it is a good tv show
4,Great series,"I think this is a great series, one of my favorites of all time. This is like watching the westerns of the '50's and 60's. Dr Quinn Medicine Woman is a very family friendly show. There is something for everyone. There is romance, history, drama, Indians, beautiful scenery, etc. The actors and story telling are great.The reason I rated this four stars instead of five is price and packaging. This is one of the most expensive series I have seen. There are only a couple episodes on each single layer disk and a seperate case for each disk. I have noticed errors in the write ups for the episodes too. Like on the second episode Brian is the one to get sick not Colleen.Still, if you can afford the hefty price for this series, it is definitely a quality show to be enjoyed for years to come."
5,"I love the Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman series!(esp. Joe Lando)","I haven't watched the DVDs yet, but I know they'll be good. I am a huge fan of the show, and taped every episode on VHS since it started. I knew quality programming like it would probably not be airing in the future when I have kids, so I wanted to have something wholesome for them to watch one day. I was super excited to hear a while back that season one would be coming out on DVD because I was worried about my VCR tapes wearing out over time. Now I'll have this wonderful collection preserved forever! I really hope they release the rest of the seasons on DVD because I'll definitely buy them. I'll be able to freeze frame on Joe Lando without worrying about stretching tape. (hehe)"
3,Great Series Deserves Closed-Captioned for Hearing Impared,"""Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman"" is one of the best TV series. I'm glad to see its release on DVD, but disappointed to find that it's not closed-captioned like it's described in Amazon.com's ""Product Details."" Once again, the hearing impared are ignored, and cannot fully appreciate the great series. In terms of the rating, the Series itself deserves FIVE STARS, but I give the DVD three stars for its lack of close captions, and its false advertisement in the ""Product Details.""For the hearing people, enjoy this top quality series that features one of the best heroines of all time. The season one is the best, and the pilot brilliantly sets up the characters. Dr. Quinn and Sully embody the conscience of the white people, and their charisma carries the show.I hope that the DVD set will be availble for the rest of the seasons, and WITH closed captions for the hearing impared."
5,Just Discovering The Magic,"I always knew Dr.Quinn was on CBS,but I only caught the ocassional show. When Hallmark started showing the re-runs,I became a huge fan. Its a great family drama that doesn't take the easy way out when it comes to tough issues. A brillantly acted show that showcases a wide variety of talents. I will be buying Season 2 very shortly. Hopefully,there will be another re-union movie at some point."
3,Fantastic series: not great recording,"I am a long standing fan of Dr Quinn, having grown up watching it every week along with Little House. I cannot fault the programme, cast or plots, you become completely immersed in the series and want to buy the whole collection.However on my set of DVD's the speech is out of sinc by about a 2 second delay in some episodes. This makes watching the DVD's most frustrating. I am assuming that I have just got a faulty set, but all three DVD's are the same. For the expensive price I expect something better than this, it is not like it is an old programme 1993 was beyond getting simple things like speech correct! I am only saying this to warn other people, but don't be put off, as the series is fantastic!!!"
4,Out of Order,"I am very pleased with my purchase of season one but have noticed that the episodes aren't in the correct order. In one episode Sully and Dr. Mike are all lovey dovey and in later episodes they are still pretending they don't like each other. In one episode the town has learned to love Dr. Quinn and support her and in later episodes they act like they still think she is some crazy woman. Well, just an observation."
4,No captions; no subtitles,We just watched the pilot episode and enjoyed it thoroughly. BUT there is no close-captioning and no subtitles. Not for the deaf or hard-of-hearing. We would have paid more to have that feature.
5,What TV Shows Should Be,"This is an absolutely wonderful show. I remember watching it when I was a kid and it is still as good now as it was then. This is a perfect show to sit down and watch as a family. It has great life-lessons, teaches you a bit about historical times and is entertaining to boot. You can't go wrong. Drama, action, romance - its all there."
3,good but too violent,"Expecting a ""Little House On The Prairie"" family oriented movie, I was somewhat surprised at the graphic violence at times. Also, there are at times, adult themes in this season. This is the first season I have watched so I'm not sure about the other seasons. The story line is good and holds your interest, but I have not finished the season because of these issues. If they had left these scenes out or modified them, it would be a good and entertaining series to view."
3,Slightly disappointed due to missing parts.,"I believe that there are scenes and possibly an episode missing from this collection. There are definitely some parts I remember seeing before that are not in it. The episodes that are here are good, but some of them seem a little rushed due to missing content."
5,Amazing Photography,"This is an outstanding book...as one who just returned from a trip to Angkor Wat, Angkor Cities and Temples provides beautiful photography of these amazing structures and an excellent description of the sites. I highly recommend it to anyone who is going to Siem Reap to help prepare for your visit. It is also a most memorable book that you can share with your friends as you attempt to describe this historic area."
3,milk thistle,"Product was acceptable and reasonably priced. It arrived promptly and, trusting that is contains the labeled ingredients, I think it is a fine product."
5,"I'm not Jillian's biggest fan, but I love this","The combo moves create a workout that both strengthens and gets your heart rate up for a cardio boost. I am an early intermediate exerciser & was able to complete level 1 immediately, with some definate sweating. After 3 weeks I added on level 2 & was able to complete most of that. I imagine with another week or 2 I'll have that level down."
5,feel the burn,"This is a great video. i really love the fact that you can select your workout as you progress.so far i've lost 13 lbs in 6 wks between this video, diet and pilaties."
5,Wow!,I thought this was an excellent video with a great way to progress from a lower to higher level of exercise. I really liked the way I can customize my workout also.I can already see results from all three workouts. It was also quite helpful to see that others struggle with form as some of the Biggest Loser contestants did. This made the video more accessible to real people who are not athletes but want to improve both appearance and health.I would recommend this video to anyone wanting an effective work out that really works!
1,Not great,"This is proof that you should never purchase a video based on a TV show, it just does not work."
3,Okay,We had issues as we didn't receive the first dvd sent and it had to be sent again and that one arrived.
1,WON'T WORK,"THE DVD WON'T WORK IN THE PLAYER IN MY EXERCISE ROOM, SO I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO USE IT. ALL OTHER DVDS THAT I HAVE WORK THERE. THIS ONE WORKS ON THE DVD PLAYER IN OUR DEN. I JUST CAN'T WORK OUT THERE. I NEED TO RETURN IT BUT HAVEN'T. NOT WORTH THE POSTAGE I DON'T GUESS..."
3,Too Fast with Poor Instructions,"Let me start by saying that I'm not overweight but definitely out of shape. I wanted to start exercising at home and bought this DVD. I did the level 1 workout and could barely keep up. The movements went way too fast for me. I don't think they allowed enough time between movements to do the exercises correctly. I felt rushed the whole time and by the time I was able to do the exercise properly, they were off to the next movement. The whole time, I was losing my balance and just doing the exercises wrong. The next few days my knee was bothering me and I don't normally have knee problems. I had no desire to try this DVD again so I ended up just giving it away."
4,challenging routine,"This is a great sculpting routine. The customized plans helped prevent me from getting bored, so, you'll be able do use it 4-5 times a week, as recommended. I gave 4 out of 5 stars because I didn't like the music and you couldn't turn it off without turning off the instructor as well. Overall, I would recommend this video to my friends."
4,A good product that will make you work.,I already owned the Biggest Loser Cardio Max workout and wanted to get this as a companion. It's not easy but it is a good workout and definitely worth the money.
4,It's great!,"I've been a Biggest Loser fan for two years and I have all of the dvds. The first BL workout is my fave and this one is really great. I really love Bob & Jillian. Kim...I could can take her or leave her but she's still good, I'm just crazy about the other two. By the way, try the new 30 Day Shred by Jillian Michaels. It's AWESOME! Challenging, but awesome. You feel so strong after you've done her workouts. I've been very happy with all of the BL affliated workouts. I'm looking forward to Bob's new book, too."
2,Not much of a workout,"I recently had a baby and wanted to get back in shape, so when this came out on sale on Amazon, I jumped at the chance to start up a new workout. The reviews seemed to show that it was challenging enough, but simple enough for beginners. When I got it, I was pretty disappointed. The first workout was not at all challenging. I'm not an incredibly fit person and had not used a workout video in several months due to pregnancy, but jeez, I didn't even crack a sweat. It also looked like it was filmed in a bargain basement. Overall, not the quality or the workout that I'm used to from big names such as this. I guess that's OK since it was under ten bucks."
4,Good Workout!,"I exercise moderately 4-5 times a week, powerwalking and doing pilates and yoga, but my routine lacked cardio and weight training. I purchased this along with Cardio Max, and together they are a very good workout. I'm only giving it 4 stars because I don't think the Level 1 workout on this DVD, at least for me, is the same intensity as the cardio companion. For most of the exercises I felt like I needed more reps than were done to work the muscle enough. After the first time I did it, I upped it to level 2. Lower weight with more reps gives your muscles nice shape, and as a woman thats more what I'm aiming for rather than strength training. With that said, it is still a fantastic workout, that I do recommend. The ""Maximum Results Program"" on the DVD recommends you alternate between this and the Cardio Max workout each day for five to six times a week. I've been doing them both daily, one in the morning, and the other in the evening. I'm expecting Fantastic Results!"
2,"If you have done the 30 Day Shred, this video is NOT for you.",I'm only 10 days into the 30 day shred but doing this video felt more like a slow warm up if anything. I did all three levels and was confused at the end because I didn't get a work out at all. All of the exercises are short and extremely easy to do. If anyone can make some recommendations on a workout similar to the shred leave me a note here.
4,Losing Big,This workout is really good for toning and sculpting the body. I use it alternately with the Biggest Loser Cardio Max for a complete body workout. Would recommend to anyone getting started on a workout routine. It has three levels that you can customize as you get stronger and want to progress to something more vigorous.
4,Good solid work-out,"Any one who watches the Biggest Loser on TV and expects to get some of the same treatment from the trainers on this DVD might be a little disappointed at first. However if you workthrough the programme, it will become very evident that it is a lot tougher that it first looks. It is a good solid work-out. But like everything else, if you want results you have to keep it up."
5,Well worth the money!,"Not all exercise DVD's are worth the money, but this one is. It is actually like buying several in one. You are able to customize your workouts from low to high intensity based on fitness level. Absolutely Awesome. Thanks."
4,Good Workout,Just started working out and I find these dvds pretty easy to get used to and I love the fact that everyone on the screen is not super skinny already so u know that they really do these workouts and they work
4,The Biggest Loser Workout: Power Sculpt,"Do you want your butt kicked during a workout? Well do you? Wow! The Biggest Loser Workout:Power Sculpt is not for beginners. Luckily there's streght levels to tone down the workouts. Jillian Michaels should have been born a male Olympiad. Be sure to watch video in its entirety because, you wouldn't know that there was a beginning workout in the special features to start you off."
1,Boring,"Jillian is as mean as ever. She talks all through her part. I wanted less talk and more action. This DVD is super easy. If you are obese and new to working out, this DVD may be tough for you for 2 weeks tops. Dont waste you money. I suggest Bob's yoga DVD instead. Its a killer and its super fun."
4,Great Deal,This is a though workout when done after the cardio!! You can really tell that it works..I cant wait to see the resaults!
2,For those who are not in shape and have a lot of weight to lose,"I have some of Jillian's workout DVD's so I thought this one with all 3 trainers would be great. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy these workouts at all. They kept me moving, yes, but they were too simple for me. I'm not a beginner, but I am by no means advanced. I thought I would like that the workout used former contestants, but I don't like it. They didn't stay together and the trainers didn't always do the whole workout so I felt like I was doing things wrong by watching them. The kickboxing segment that was supposed to be Level 3 was about as intense as walking. I see what that trainer isn't on the show anymore, she's just not very good. I would reccommend this video if you are new to exercising, but I would do something like Jillian's 30 Day Shred first so you actually learn about good form."
2,Not sure yet!,"I turned on this DVD this morning for the first time (after I finished working out to another of Jillian's DVD's). For starters, the ""background"" music is too loud. Secondly, the trainers, especially Jillian, show the correct way to do the exercise maybe one time, and then you get to watch the class participants the rest of the time, and several of them are not doing the exercise correctly and/or have bad form. I'm new to exercise, so I need more proper instruction than this. I'm not giving up on this DVD yet, I'll actually try the workouts before I decide whether or not to keep it. I've been doing Jillian's ""The Complete Workout for Beginners"" for the last 6 weeks, and it's a good workout, but it's time for me to move on."
4,Fast shipping!!,"Thanks for the fast shipping, item arrived new and I love my DVD!!! I would definitely buy from this seller again."
2,Power Sculpt,"Very intermediate workout if you already are in shape. Would be good for people who are trying to lose weight and gain muscle, not a good enough workout for people trying to maintain the weight they are at."
3,A little boring,"If you haven't done workout videos at home before, this one it's a really good one to start to keep your heart rate up and to help you to be active while you're home but not a good one if you are looking for challenges."
4,Arms were sore! Yippy,I am ex-ARMY and was trying to get in shape after having a baby. This is a great video for days I could not get to the gym.
4,biggest loser video,just what i was looking for glad to have found it.Will be using soon hope 3 times a week great service care in packaging
4,Good dvd but...,That dvd provides some good exercises but I expected more.. I love the exercises with Jillian and Bob. The ones with Kim are good but she sounds sooo boring and not motivating at all.
4,Feeling the burn ;->,"The training gang are back again with another workout, but this is pretty much all toning. It's about 50 minutes and it works you from head to toe. These guys don't mess around and you will work hard (but even though you are sore the next day, you want to keep at it because you know it will give you great results).You can do a 30 minute level 1 workout or a 50 minute level 3 workout so as you get stronger, the workouts get tougher and you will avoid plateaus and boredom. This feature will keep you moving up the strength scale and keep challenging you. They suggest you need weights within about a 3lb to a 10lb range and if you are new to weight workouts, then you want to start light. These guys are very motivating but yet they make it fun. The contestants from past seasons are working out too and that is also motivating. I really like this and can't wait to do it again."
4,The Biggest Losers create the Biggest Pains!,"Bought this along with the Cardio DVD and all I can say is wow.All 3 trainers are here just like in the Cardio and it doesn't take long before they start making you sweat! The great thing with this DVD is you can pick your poison with a 20 minute level 1, 10 minute level 2 and 10 minute level 3 sculpt workout. For a real challenge sign up for all 3 and hit play!It won't take long before your muscles are screaming and the sweat is rolling off your forehead. Lot's of lunges in this along with biceps and shoulder presses. All the good stuff is in here.I have no doubt that combined with the Cardio DVD just released, you can lose some serious weight with these."
5,Great for Beginners,"I think this is a good intro into strength training. I am up to level 2 and I am enjoying it. I can actually see the results. If you are just starting your weight loss journey like I am, then this is perfect. If you are a pro athlete, then your not going to get much out of this."
2,Not Tough enough!,"Look, I'm no super athlete- not at all- but I do workout & I want Fast results. I use Tae bo, Fighting fit, & Jillian Micheals 30 day shred regularly. After completing the 30 day shred (which was awesome- tough, and got great results! especially when you two in a row!) I was swayed into getting this Power Sculpt and Cardio max just for some variety- This was a BIG dissapointment after the Jillian Micheal's 30 day shred. This just does not cut it. The warm up is a joke- I went through all six customizable workouts at once and did not feel any benefit except for small portion of the last two workouts.Ok- Maybe- if you are brand new to this- this is the dvd for you- but if you are coming off of any other form of fitness training- advance to something harder and better- like Tony Horton's 10 minute series or the P90X"
1,Boring and Not Tough Enough,I love Turbo Jam (Chalene Johnson) and Jeanette Jenkins' workout videos because they are so fun AND effective. I bought this video because it had such good ratings. Did the workout once and will never do it again. It wasn't as effective as the videos I already have and it was not fun at all.
2,Jillian is just awful on this DVD,"I LOVE Jillian Michael's other DVDs, but she is just awful on this one and half of the workout time is with her. She makes a lot of mistakes in her instructions. I don't know why they didn't stop recording and start over! After doing the workout a few times, it's just too annoying to do the segment with her.The other segments are good and I like that the DVDs are set up that you can choose which portions of the DVD you want to do. But after leaving out the Jillian part, it's only a 20 minute workout."
4,Biggest Loser Power Sculpt,I really like the DVD and love doing the Biggest Loser workouts! I love the show so this helps.
4,"Great Workout, Good Results, Could Do Without the Blonde Trainer talking to the viewer like I'm a Child","Great workout and I love how you can change it up and add and take away. Whenever I can't make it to the gym due to be pressed for time, I do one of the routines on this DVD and even the 10 minute ones still kicks my butt!My only caution is for beginners (and I saw someone else mention this) watch the trainer for form- a lot of the attendees in the class are hurrying to get the reps done and their form is off and you can hurt yourself.Superficial complaint: I could do without the blonde trainer being cutesy and wasting time making eyes at the camera chirping ""Don't you dare put that weight down! Don't you dare!"". I wasn't thinking about the burn or putting the weight down until you started bringing it up so much. Muting her has helped make her workout more bearable."
4,no el mejor pero si de los buenos,"Siempre me ha gustado como canta Mijares, asi que me enfocare a decirles que es bueno en lo que hace, me gusta este material, no es el mejor pero si es uno de los que dejan huella."
3,Buen álbum pero pudo ser más,"Mijares es un buen cantante, tiene una voz poderosa y con estilo, pero este disco no lo luce tanto y al parecer mucho del trabajo de composición fue como ""de relleno"". Es bueno para escucharlo mientras trabajas en la computadora o para lounge (si tienes un café internet o algo así, sería una buena opción).Las mejores canciones en mi opinión: ""Señales de amor"" y ""Capuccino""."
4,I liked it!,"Saw it playing on a Dish pay channel, turned it on by chance and then I couldn't turn it off! Can't explain why really, other than it kept my attention with it's unique creep factor. No, it's not the best horror movie I've ever seen. But yes, it is entertaining and worth a watch."
3,Slow but grabs hold,"Invasion was scary from the beginning. It took awhile before the first scary event happened and it was not bloody/gory/over the top. I was less scared after that but it grabbed hold and became a nail biter.It is a very different sort of movie. The story takes place in real time - something that really happened was caught on camera and I was watching supposedly true events. Since it is slow it doesn't create a rush, but it does make you feel like something terrible is down the road. The main character it is all happening to is agonizingly anticipating rescue or death any minute.I liked it a lot."
5,An excellent experiment in filmaking!,"The less you know about ""Invasion"" before you see it the better. I have not been this thrilled while watching a film in a long, long time. Why? Because the makers of this film chose intelligence instead of buckets of blood and gore (which serve no purpose in telling a story) and told most of their story through the use of sound. I own over 10,000 dramatic radio shows, so telling a creepy story through the use of sound is one of my favorite ways to experience a story. ""But this is a movie!"", you say. And the way this story is told using only a car's headlights for lighting is one of the most effectivly horror-inducing touches I've EVER experienced on film! Do yourself a real big treat and buy ""Invasion""!"
1,"Yawn,a real awfull bomb","Worst si-fi yawner I have ever seen.The cover box describes it as ""A risky tour de force,a stunner,challenging,hypnotic"".A 80 some minute vuew of a lonnnnng dirt back road(TOUR de farce).A STUNNER,(budget $25,4 gallons of gas and batteries for the spotlight.CHALLENGING(to anyone who can actually watch this dreck for longer than 15 minutes). HYPNOTIC as watching a cat sleeping.I suspect that reviewers that gave this thing 5 and 4 star ratings were the actors that were in this camcorder made zzzzzzz grade god awfull spamola.Not worth watching this thing(even as a free rental)."
1,OK for a low budget film,"OK, if you take into consideration that it's a very low-budget sci-fi movie, then the film is pretty passable about a meteor shower containing organisms that turn people into puppets of alien parasites. Having taken the low budget into considertation, there are a number of shortcomings to the movie. First, it's a one hour film, followed by 20 minutes of credits---WTF? Second, A LOT of the time is dead time, with nothing happening; that amount of time could have been cut down, or better yet, additional material added. Third, I kept hoping that the foul-mouthed, self-centered bimbo was going to get it."
1,Invasion of Time,"A real stinker. Read the reviews. High Definition Dash Cam,..huh?Almost a living dead movie,.. but not a little bit as interestingif you think living dead movies are that. Meteors carryingcatapillers from outer space which are somehow getting into human idiots.Teen prom queen driving a police car endlessly on bad roads in some parkcrying and screaming,... seeing zombies of her boyfriend and othersincluding her self. Uh duh,...save your coins. Hope I did not spoilthe flick for you."
3,Not Good for Large Heads,"The helmet seems OK, but it did not fit me very well. I have a fairly large head, and needed to loosen the size adjustment all the way just to get the helmet on. Then the strap in back that goes from the top of the helmet to the chin strap has a kink in it that digs into my head. I had a Bell helmet before, and did not need to loosen the adjuster all the way. This helmet was not comfortable, and I am returning it."
5,Giro Transfer - Even without the described snap-fit visor,"I purchased this helmet fully expecting to receive it and have it not fit, given the proportions of my skull. Right out of the box it fit like a glove as it were. I am very pleased. The fact that the helmet did not ship with the snap-fit visor that was listed in the helmet description does not bother me. The helmet is very light weight yet rigid and the 20 vents lend to a very discernable cooling effect. I find this helmet extremely comfortable even after wearing for a considerable amount of time. I definately feel I got the most for my buck with this helmet making it very economical. I would recommend this helmet for young or old with its dial a fit feature and if looks matter I'm of the opinion that it is a great style making it adequately functional as well as great looking.I am a true fan of the Giro Transport Helmet."
4,"Good helmet, but not for large heads","I have a large skull, but as a universal-fit helmet, I expected this to fit well. Well, it does fit, but tightly. Mainly, the sides of my head are pressured against the helmet; when I bite down and the muscles on the side of my head bulge, it is uncomfortable. There is an itty-bitty gap between my forehead and the helmet, which is slightly annoying. My head is a tad bit larger (wider) than the helmet can accommodate well. The helmet makes odd contacts with the top of my head, too; some parts of my head are touching the helmet while leaving gaps in other parts. I suspect that if I were to have a head-on collision, those odd contact points would receive the bulk of the forces. Anyway, despite my gripes with this helmet, it fits (albeit tightly) and that other models costs twice as much so I'm keeping it anyway."
2,giro transfer,"I bought this helmet from the description, it says that it has a snap fit visor, one was not in the box, Either include the visor or modify the product description. I have included the address to the description page.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BO3D18/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
2,Woman's bike halmet and I am a Man!!,It fits but it says its a Woman's Helmet on the box :(it even came in a pink box senses woman live the color pink.GIRO = Girl? but I see men wearing giro helmets on there website.Can someone tell I am wearing a woman's bike helmet when riding my bike around?
2,order,"Placed an order which was on sale and waited for a month. Didn't get any response from the seller when I asked for a tracking number. In the end, only to be told by Amazon that the order is cancelled."
1,Why is this publisher spamming me with unsolicited magazine subscriptions,"Let me clarify: I am not a Spanish language speaker. Yet, suddenly I started receiving the Spanish Cosmopolitan magazine without making a subscription. Even worse, soon followed unsolicited subscriptions to TvyNovelas and Vanidades. I discourage you to make a subscription, this magazine (or any of the others) is not worth your time - their spamming practices are unacceptable."
2,Just shoot me,"You know ""Blush"" magazine? Its fictional headquarters are the set of the NBC sitcom Just Shoot Me. You read their headlines and article ideas, and you know they're based on this little piece of waste! What shocks me is that I know 13-year-old girls get their dose of sex and guys information from it. Very shallow, they try to be so sophisticated it ends up being naive! Stay away from it"
1,Trashy magazine,"Trashy magazine, it only focuses on sex. Like ifsex is going to solve your emotional problems.This culture is so obssesed with sex.If you really want to read about relationships,I recommend ""save your marriage before it starts""it gives you real info from two psychologist whymarriage is going downhill and how you can save it."
1,There is only one Mediator.,"Stay away from any writing or anything pertainingto the Virgin Mary. She is a false mediator.""Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name [the LORD Jesus Christ]under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved."" Acts 4:12""I am the way, the truth, and the life: No man cometh untothe Father, but by Me."" John 14:6"
4,So-so book,"This book is mainly a collection of various apparitions of Mary. It covers widely known apparitions such as Lourdes, Fatima, and Guadaloupe as well as less familiar ones. This book, I would say, is an introduction for those who want to study Marian apparitions in depth. It briefly summarizes the accounts, and provides SOME testimony from the visonaries themselves. The best part of the book, I think, is the beautiful artwork of Mary through the ages that are shown on every other page."
5,Well-worth time spent,I am not Catholic and therefore had never heard the miraculous stories of our Mother Mary. This book left me wanting more.
2,Rather dry.,"In the search for/of Miracles of the Virgin Mother, the content was rather dry. Good historical reference book, but lacking ""meat""."
2,Not satisfied,"I use pressure cookers for most of my dishes.Let me tell you that the price is reasonable and it works perfect for all the lentils and meats-- provided you add lots of water. But few dishes, like Pulav and other non gravy items, where water should be added to the measure, then this cooker is no good. This has thinner base and food gets burnt and stuck at the bottom. Its a hassle to clean the cooker when that happens.The ""Prestige cooker"" in India has far better quality than this. Now I am looking to buy the original prestige brand that a few indian stores sell."
5,Enchanting Atlantis,"""Unearthing Atlantis: An Archaelogical Odyssey to the Fabled Lost Civilization"" by Charles Pellegrino is an enchanting, well researched, well rounded book about the Greek island of Santorini and the volcanic explosion which probably destroyed Minoan civilization. This is one of the best books I have read in a long time; it was very difficult for me to put down, as Pellegrino expertly combines history, archaelogy, art, literature and science to write a comprehensive story of the lost civilization of Santorini/ Atlantis. As a matter of fact, I found myself studying , not just reading, this book, and am currently rereading it a second time. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Greek history, Atlantis, or a good mystery."
4,Fascinating Read,"I read this book while spending a week in Santorini. It was the perfect book to read while sitting on the beach, looking at all the tourists and imagining how different and more advanced Theran life must have been like 37 or so centuries ago, before the volcano took away two thirds of the island to create one of the most scenic, photographed places on earth. The thought that the Theran volcano explosion caused the pestilence and plagues mentioned in the Bible was startling. Could it be true? Could Thera be the lost Atlantis? Well, why not? Read it for yourself and see. And check out the Theran wall paintings excavated in Akrotiri on the web, especially the one with the unique antelopes that only exist in one part of Africa to this day and see if you don't start to wonder yourself about what really happened."
1,"Oh no!!! Pellegrino!!! "" Unearthing Atlantis""","An author so full of his own importance it is a wonder that he hasn't exploded by now.This has to be the most useless and boring book I have ever read. If you want to bore yourself to sleep, still wondering what on earth he is babbling on about then go ahead and read it!!! Did you know the Minoans had indoor plumbing?? You will. Go on I dare you to waste your money and time!!"
4,Perfect gift for your partner who missed that easy 3 footer.,"A ridiculous romp over nine chapters penned by nine different authors each one more loony than the previous. Pretty fun spoof of the PGA, the LPGA, Microsoft, ESPN, political leaders everywhere, the CIA & MI5, and that whole Sansabelt fashion thing. This tale rolls along with all the straightforwardness of a 50 foot sidehill putt at Augusta.True golf aficionados will be advised to stick to Herbert Warren Wind, but fans of Dave Barry, Ridley Pearson and other Harvard lampoon style goofballs will enjoy the light reading, zany story. Perfect reading for the plane or Winnebago ride to Myrtle Beach. A better gift for your golfer than another useless distance-finder."
2,my opinion,"It's great for the money, perhaps I shouldn't have been so frugal. The material used in this product would have been much more useful if it were made of a harder plastic. It just grips the mic too snuggly."
5,Perfect!,This fits perfectly on my desktop mic stand and my mic fits right in! Great product considering the price! Very satisfied!
2,You're Better Off Paying a Few Extra $ On A Better One...,"At first i thought these were okay and got the job done just fine. After a few weeks I started noticing that the adapter was falling apart and becoming unusable. My little microphone might have been a little too heavy for it im guessing. The adapter that screws on to your mic stand detached from the actual plastic of the mic holder. It was fixable, but just really annoying to fix everyday. I suggest you spend a little extra money on a better mic clip holder because this clip doesn't last very long. The plastic and screws feel flimsy, and the construction is really bad. From my experience, anything labeled ""Musician's Gear"" on Amazon, like this mic clip, is in the long run, not a very good investment. They're cheap, and basic. They get the job done yeah, but not a very good job. They end up falling apart after a few weeks or months."
5,Good strong clip,"The clip is solid and strong.A word of caution, it barely fits the fatter ""Band Hero"" microphones. We got it to work, but a slightly larger clip would work better. Most standard mics are narrower than these game mics, so it shouldn't be an issue for those.I can't vouch for ""Rock Band"" microphones."
4,HEAVY DUTY BASIC MIC CLIP,"It was a very fast shipment. The clip feels sturdy and not cheaply made, but the only problem I had was it does not hold none of my microphones (which was totally my fault because I should have check the description carefully). Please make sure that you have a thin body frame mic before purchasing this clip."
2,meh,"I guess I should have spent a little more time researching clips. I suppose it is functional, just inexpensive and flimsy."
2,Threads broken,"The inside threads were broken, making it nearly impossible to put on the stand. However, we did finally get it on, but now it will not stay on the stand. Because the cost of it was so cheap, it is not worth sending back."
4,So Far So Good,This item seemed to almost not fit the nady microphone that I purchased but it was easy to stretch around the mic....so Far so Good
4,Mic Clips,"What's not to like? These mic clips are heavy duty plastic and they were inexpensive. I've used them for quite some time now and even after crushing falls onto the concrete they're still going strong. Like I said, inexpensive and heavy duty. Two of my all time favorite attributes. I recommend them highly."
2,BEWARE:!!! It's not a hard plastic Mic Clip it's Rubber,"Not happy with the sellers description or the product. The description says ""Heavy Duty"" which makes you assume that it's a regular hard plastic Mic Clip, but it's not. IT'S RUBBER!!! It sucks. Used it a couple times and it's hard to slide the mic in and I can see after a couple more uses how it's probably going to need to be taped because the swivel will become very loos cause the rubber will wear down quickly, and flex. IT'S FLEXIBLE!!! Who uses Flexible Mic Clips?!!! Make sure you don't buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead."
2,Disappointed 2nd time buyer,"We had purchased this item previously and received what was shown in picture. This time the item we recieved was not the same quality or material, hard plastic as opposed to soft molded rubber to hold the mic. Fortunately we had one of the older styles ordered and was able to use."
4,good stuff,"its not the best (Plastic), but its way above the bad. This is perfect for everyday use, just got to keep the bolts tight."
2,OKAY,Its an okay clip. I have had better. It does not brake or anything bad like that it is just OKAY.
5,Scary as hell!!,"This book was passed on to me by a friend who was pretty much TRYING to get it out of her house because it scared her so much! Now I want to do the same! Malachi Martin, I'm told is THE actual boy the story and later movie, ""The Exorcist"" was written about. A friend of a close friend of mine has actually sat in on lectures Malachi has given at various places and the odd thing about this is that everytime this friend would go and listen to him speak about posession,he would record the lecture on tape. Then, when he'd go home to play it back, it was always dead air that was recorded.This happened many times at many different lectures and he still cant figure out why- the tape records everything to this day except Martin's voice....."
3,"Very good, but with reservations","Fr. Martin's accounts of five cases of exorcism are not for the faint of heart. The sort of diabolic possession that Fr. Martin describes is all too true, and this book serves as a sort of wake-up call to those who would think otherwise. Fr. Martin is his usual captivating self throughout the book -- he really knew how to tell a story -- and the book is hard to put down. The accounts themselves certainly seem credible, though the extraneous commentary of Fr. Martin, especially in the original preface, seems out of place and sometimes at odds with the Catholicism he claimed to champion while he lived. I'm surprised that he didn't edit some of it out in this later edition. My only other concern is that he seems to be more graphic and explicit than necessary in recounting the exorcisms. I realize that much was edited from the original transcripts, but more should have been cut, in my opinion."
4,Careful! - You may become possessed yourself,"I though the writing was a little verbose, but the content and depth of the witness is very intense. In fact, it is so intense that had I not already known what I know about the subject matter, I would still not be sleeping at night. This is the most in-depth look at possession I have yet to read. Those that don't believe in such things do so only because they have never interviewed the victoms and exocists. This book does both."
1,More Fiction,"This book is not representing the reality of exorcises, the author use too much of his imagination and his own thoughts, this book is full of cults, it is a shame for any one use his own thoughts and imagination to treat this subject writing a religion book as a novel, therefore this book is full of lying as a form of recipe to make the book more interesting and boost its sale.I'm a person who grow up in Egypt and I'm Christian Coptic orthodox, where exorcism is something more popular and practice by some priest, as a witness for many cases of exorcises I watched and participated sometimes helping the priest I never heard or saw what was written in this book, I saw the priests with full authority and power in the name of our lord Jesus Christ to cast out demons as he wished, please see the following link to see by yourdelfhttp://www.alkalema.net/cd5.htm"
1,Hoax,"Martin's boak is a sensationalistic hoax predicated on the fear inspired by Blatty and used to play off of contemporary America's need to ""cleanse and absolve"" themselves through various means of therapy. For better reading on Exorcisms and ""deliverance"", check out Michael Cuneo's ""Amercian Exorcism"", which documents Martin, Peck, et al's quest to tap into a need and feed the fear of a fundamentally ludicrous concept. This stuff is the opiate of the people, and it is time to get off the pipe, folks."
2,A bit wordy,"I have read many books in my time and I am very educated, however I did find this book to be a bit complicated to read, I was easly tempted to skip whole sections to get to the point. The author tends to be a bit wordy and long winded in his explantions. He tends to use allot of metophors which is not a bad thing, just not my style of reading.I also found that the book tends to be a bit laid back on the whole subject. Skiping perhaps how dangerious the whole occult world is.Exercisoms in gerneral are dangerious work, and tends not to come on as the author tends to protray it.If your looking for a real meat and potatos book on the subject I would add that ""beware of the Night"" is a much more realistic view of the whole matter."
1,a total fraud,"To give him his due the great clerical con man Malachi Martin is able to unite a linguistic flare, an Irishman's storytelling ability and a scholar's mind to create quite a fascinating work. Martin was an opportunist who preyed on various societal forces to make a quick buck. With the great commercial success of the film ""the exorcist"" Malachi jumped on the bandwagon and penned this bestseller. None of the stories can be varified at all, and Martin has made a name for himself in literary and Church circles for spreading lies and calumny. The reality of exorcism is not in question, but Martin is not the man from whom to get the story. I reccomend instead the excellent book on the subject by Gabriel Amorth."
3,Mostly Disturbing,"The Lord spoke one word to my heart about this book as I was reading it--""hyperbole"". That fits. Although I believe the people portrayed were indeed possessed, the exorcists themselves seemed to jump through too many hoops to get rid of the demons. The bible says to cast them out in the name of Jesus....period. I didn't finish this book all the way. It was opening too many doors in my mind that weren't meant to be ajar.Carrie Lynn JonesAuthor of:It All Began... When Jesus Gave Me Sneakers"
3,a way out ride of terror,"I believe that Malachi Martin was a fine man and an interesting writer. I read ""Windswept House"" and thought that it was a great piece of work. ""Hostage to the Devil"" is definately interesting. I couldn't put it down. The problem I had with it is that the stories seemed to get more and more fantastic and way out as the book went on. Believing in some of these demons was sort of like watching the movie ""Beetlejuice"" and taking it serious. The book is a good account of evil vs. good in the world. I do believe that some of it may be true; and some can be taken with a grain of salt. It does start off as being pretty scary, but after a while you become immune to the terror. Keep a logical and open mind when reading this one."
1,a disappointment,this was not factually researched like his other book on the papacy...it was more like superstitious drivel preying on the gullabiiity of readers. seemed to be superstitious hype in the guise of religion
1,DANGEROUS!!!!,"This book is dangerous. By opening it up, you are inviting a world of evil into your life. I am a non-denominational christian who was raised catholic, so i've seen both sides of the coin regarding excorcism and spiritual warfare. Not only is this book one-sided in favor of oldschool catholocism, but it focuses on evil in such a way that compells and captivates the reader, glorifying Satan in a not-so-obvious way. Remember, Satan is the father of lies, and many might think reading a book about excorcism written by a jesuit priest is harmless and safe, when in fact it is not. After the introduction and story of Father Michael in China, i felt driven to prayer, and then promptly returned the book to the store i purchased it from earlier that same day. I should have just burned it instead."
3,It's hard to judge...,"I've listened to M. Martin speak on various talk shows and have found him to be very interesting. This book is a hard one to grasp. I didn't understand the concept of the weakening of the demon's hold over a person during an exorcism. The priest seems to keep repeating phrases using Jesus name to cast it out. By why does it take numerous incantations in order for it to work? M. Martin uses many nebulous phrases through out the book to describe possession, but I just couldn't grasp his expression of thought. For me it became a frustrating read. Assuming that these are indeed true accounts, I was shocked at the vulgarity and the hatred demons have for mankind. Also, that they know intimate details of a person's life is a frightening thought. In closing, there is deep subject matter here, but I found trying to analyze it, only led to my frustation."
5,"Deeply disturbing, but very uplifting too",Balanced against the profound evil documented in this book is the triumph of pure good. What is deeply moving is the willingness of the five exorcists to risk the unimaginable to save a human soul. That glimpse of God's love as manifested in his very human agents is what is shattering in this book and what will remain with the reader.
3,This book is good for entertainment purposes only,"First off, I do beleive that demonic possession can occur, has occured & will continue to occur. In reading this book, however, I had to stop and keep wondering how much of this was real. The author acknowledges that the publisher had no way of checking his claims due to his promise of annomimity for the persons involved. He also claims to have used interviews and transcripts from actual recordings of exorcisms, but frequently I felt that he was injecting his own veiw or taking artistic license with the subject matter. The book was interesting and sometimes engrossing, but was not as scary as some other reviewers had made it out to be."
5,A window into the world of exorcism and the devil,"""Hostage to the Devil"" offers 5 (and part of a 6th) in-depth accounts of exorcisms. Both the victims and the priests (all these exorcisms were performed by Roman Catholic priests) performing the exorcisms are examined in pretty good detail. It was much more real than any horror film or scary book you have ever read - because it was all real. The accounts are gripping and the narrative will propel you to the finish. After the 5 stories, the author offers insights into exorcism and theological underpinnings of it. Very interesting stuff.Word of warning: This book is not for everyone. There are detailed accounts of satanic rituals and experiences - only for a mature, well-grounded audience with a stomach for it. I fancy myself a pretty tough fellow, but there were things in this book that made me cringe/flinch and almost vomit. So be forewarned."
3,Satan Made Me Piss Myself.,"This book is an interesting look into the lives of the possessed and those that help them. The book is extremely detailed......Maybe a little bit too much for my taste. The book not only delves into the actual exorcism of an individual and their past......Oh, and the priests past. I like to learn about other people but the book seems to put more emphasis on what, how, when, where and how some one got to this point and their whole life story is told before you even get to the exorcism. *YAWN*. I like a little back story but this is just to much. The actual stories of the exorcisms are amazing! They are extremely detailed and well written and you will be un able to stop reading. I have to give it three stars for all the back peddling. This book is however a great reminder that there is something out there bigger than ourselves."
3,A good idea...but too in depth,"Being interested in the subject of demonology this book grabbed my attention. A good idea and well researched but unfortunately it was just too in depth. There was far to much detail included about certain areas of the possession adn the various people's personal life. At times I felt like I just wanted to skip several pages to cut to the chase. A good read for someone deeply interestred in the whole possession and exorcism process, but not really a very light read for the merely curious supernatural enthusiast"
2,What can I judge this on?,"When you enter a church and the presence of God fills you, it is the Holy Spirit. Every time I read this book, I had the opposite feeling, almost an emptying of my spirit. The person who lent the book to me had similar experiences. Therefore, I can not say it was a pleasant read. It is important to understand the devil's power that remains after the victory on the cross, but a thorough read through the book of Acts would give you the same thing. The priests committing the exorcisms in this book seem to have the same problems as the Sons of Sceva did in the book of Acts; saying the name of Jesus without the authority of Jesus. While this book may prove to some who believe in nothing that there is something, I can not recommend it because of the weight it put on my soul. If you want to understand the authority we have as Christians, I recommend ""Fresh Power"" by Jim Cymbala."
2,"I suspect that Father Thomas Euteneuer's ""Exorcism and the Church Militant"" would be a superior recommendation.","Over the past few years, I'd read snippets from this work. When I finally got around to tackling the book, I found myself putting it away after several hundred pages. Various sections struck me as entirely too lurid. While I have not yet read it, I suspect that Father Thomas Euteneuer's ""Exorcism and the Church Militant"" (which does not yet appear to be available through Amazon) would be a far superior recommendation."
2,Doctrinal Fear Mongering,"I read a few chapters of this book years ago. I thought it was going to be a fascinating read, but essentially what the stories recount is people who become possessed because they did not accept strict Catholic teachings - this includes a priest. I realized the author was trying to scare the reader into accepting strict Catholic teaching out of fear that he or she might be possessed if he or she does not. When I say ""strict Catholic teaching"" I'm talking about on a very arcane level not basic doctrine."
3,"Too complicated / ""gourmet"" for its own good...","Not everyone's a gourmet and nor do they want to spend the hour or so making pizza(s) that some of these recipes seem like they'll require.Most of these seem to have pretty long ingredient lists and seems a bit over-complicated. Honestly, I prefer the simpler approach taken by Keller inVegetarian Pizza Cookbook. Plus Keller seems to provide far more pizza crust options (including dessert pizzas, etc.).This book just seems to be trying too hard. Seems to me that, while variety is certainly the spice of life, one shouldn't over-complicate pizza."
1,PUT ON YOUR GLASSES,"I JUST RECEIVED THIS WATCH AND IT'S NOT WORTH MORE THEN 10 DOLLARS-IF THAT, THE FACE APPEARS A PRETTY BLUE ON THE SCREEN AND IT'S AS BLACK AS MIDNIGHT. YOU CAN HARDLY MAKE OUT THE CAT AND THE NUMBERS ARE TOO SMALL AND THE GOLD COLOR LOOKS CHEAP. I RAISE SIAMESE SO I AM ALWAYS EXCITED TO SEE SIAMESE PIECES. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK."
1,What is she talking about?,"I am currently enrolled at Harvard Medical School, and I must say that this book is an insult to me and the thousands of graduate students everywhere. The advice given in this book is totally useless when it comes to preparing for graduate school. there is no way one can spend all of his/her time just studing, in between classes that is. Only through hardwork and constant studing can one ever achieve what one sets out to do. These people are bozos. Thank You."
1,"Blinked Constantly, had to be returned","Disappointing purchase, this light blinked repeatedly, even after allowing for a warm-up period. Still looking for a decent night light, since the megabrite push button ones are currently unavailable. If the megabrite become available again, I would recommend those as they work really well."
5,plug them in & forget them.,"The title says it all,that is just what I did. The light is prefect, no flickering no fuss and no hassle setting timers or turning switches off & on. Great product."
3,"Evocative, Yet Annoying","I very much enjoyed the book as a whole-- the sense of place, the Italian characters, etc. But Ms. St. Aubin de Terain herself--hoboy. Sure, you could call her quirky, non-suburban, whatever you want, but the fact remains that she was annoying. I won't even talk about her daughter. The book was definitely worth reading, but not re-reading; not by a long shot."
2,Bizzare!,Didn't finish it--hard to follow and was never convinced I would care when I finally figured out what the story was about.
5,"Smooth, fluid words with a Mom's love","This book works well for 2-month old babies to 92-year old grandmas. Afterall, we all have to venture out of the nest and explore the colorful world around us, but it's always nice to have Momma meet us at the end of our adventures."
5,Parents beware! It's almost too good!,"We picked this book up at a tag sale when my [...] was about 5 months old. It's her all time favorite book and she wants to read it constantly, over and over again. Between my husband, [...] daughter, and me, we each read it to her 3-5 times a day unless we hide it! It's falling apart, we don't need to look at the text anymore when we read it. Of all the books that she loves like this it's one of our favorites, too. It's a sweet simple story about those first steps children take towards independence, even when mama is close by. The illustrations are beautiful with vivid colors."
4,The Diamond Story,Very nice information contained on the dvd however i think much more could be included.Runtime is not very long but its worth having if you love gems.
1,Not the best one - only with modifications,"My husband bought me 2 of these feeders for my birthday. They worked ok. the Hummingbirds used them, but not as much as my others. Mine faded the first season and the words on the outside washed of first thing, which could be a good thing.I was looking through a hummingbird web site and found that these feeders are death traps for the little guys and they had a picture of one of its victims. They said if you modify them, they are useable. To modify, First, from the bottom side of the feeder lid, re-drill each port hole outward at a 45 degree angle. Next, cut or grind the nipple from the underside. If you don't have a grinder, simply used a razor blade to cut down through the nipple at a 45 degree angle. To me it's not worth the risk to my little friends and I shouldn't have to mess around with modifying something before I use it."
1,Unreliable,"This router stops working every couple of days. Internet access is lost and even the router's web interface at 192.168.2.1 cannot be reached when it stops working. Cycling power gets it working again, for a couple more days. That is totally unacceptable to me. Belkin customer support was not helpful on this issue. There are no firmware updates for this router at the time of this writing.I have two of these routers and both behave the same way.I am very disapointed with this Belkin product and it will make me think twice before I buy any other Belkin product."
1,Very poor performance.,"I had to replace my Linksys router after a surge blew it up (Despite a very good quality surge protector).I was attracted by the idea of the dual band and therefore more reliable connection. In fact, this router is anything but reliable. The range is very poor and the maximum connection speed I have ever had is 11mbps. I have had occaisions where I was literally sitting in the same room as the router and been unable to get a signal.Tech support was polite but not at all helpful. I found that they were reading to me from some source.I even eventually bought the companion Belkin card for my laptop. Didn't make any difference that I could tell.Sent it back, bought another Linksys router and life has been good"
1,Unreliable,"This router has a very irritating habit of losing the internet connection, which requires a periodic restart. Completely unacceptable!"
1,Loses Connection,"I thought I was the only one until I saw one review here complaining about losing connection to the internet. The unit has good range for me but it appears to be slower in speed compare to my Linksys wireless router. It loses connection to the internet frequently. My wife was complaining about it all the time and I personally experienced the same problem about 3 times a week. I finally trashed it when it lost connection 8 times in 2 hours. I went to the most basic Linksys router and have been very happy since. In addition, the Belkin web base manager is not as intuitive as the Linksys one. I do not recommend this product."
4,Gift for Nephew,"While the Star Wars action figure was the initial hit at Xmas, this one will challenge his engineering mind. Erector still has the quality I remember from my childhood. Though I can't get over the fact that they have power tools instead of a wrench."
2,"Poor construction , waiting on a replacement part","My son received this as a gift for Christmas. The day after Christmas he wanted to assemble it. We found out that the tool (allen wrench) at the end of the power tool was assembled backwards making not usable to put together the toy. That was what he was most looking forward to using.... a power tool! We emailed the company with a complaint and request for a replacement part. There hasn't been a response from the company nor have we received the part yet. After reading the reviews, I'm about ready to return it instead but I feel bad for him. He was so excited. How can a company that has assembly toys, assemble the parts backwards??? hmmmm... not a well put together toy."
1,Again...JUNK!!!,"I realize this toy was only $30, but this is the biggest piece of junk I have ever seen. I put this together exactly like the instructions said and tighten everything good and snug, and the thing fell apart in my hands as I was putting it together. They use little rubber grommets instead of clips to hold shafts in place. These grommets fall off before you even get it together. The new quick screws are a joke, they don't hold together for anything.I had an erector set when I was a child, and thought that it would be a great gift for my children to play with. But this toy is nothing like the one i had as a child. The poor quality of this product is absolutely disgusting and I would never buy another product from this company again. I would not recommend this toy or any other products from this company to anyone."
4,Good book for beginner fans,"KISS: The Real Story is a good book for new KISS fans who need to know basic facts about the original members of the band. There are also some rare and very old photos in here. The biggest problem is the book's age; since it was written just before Peter Criss first left the band in 1980, readers will have to look elsewhere for information about newer members Eric Carr, Vinnie Vincent, Mark St. John, Bruce Kulick and Eric Singer (and members yet to come in 2003, like Skippy the Wonder Weasel on lead kazoo).The book is primarily intended for younger fans, so please forgive Ms. Tomarkin for her ""gee-whiz isn't this great?"" writing style.If the writing was up to the quality of the pictures, I'd give it 5 stars. Not bad for a start, though."
5,great book ofkiss fans,hello !recent i buy this book of kiss is the rela book of kiss fans intersted in your collectionsis a great book and big photos colour photos of greats momnets of kiss .
3,White Vest and Tie,"Very nice, only important thing to note is this is definitely an off-white, or ivory set, not a true white."
5,Vest,Purchased at request of my Grandson for his Winter Homecoming dance. He was very pleased with the product and the quick delivery. My only problem is that it went on sale about a week after it was delivered. Would have been nice to receive a heads up so we could have ordered at sale price :(Men's Dress Vest NeckTie WHITE Color Neck Tie Set for Suit or Tuxedo Mediu
3,Packaged poorly,"The vests are ties are fine, but were sent without any protective plastic, or hangers. They were just squished into a box. They are fine for my purposes, no problem with the product quality, but if I were using these for a wedding or other major event I would have been very concerned."
5,Great,"The vest was great , although i had to wait a bit to receive it, ( around 1-2 weeks) it arrived on the date that i needed it for. Great condition, comfy , and great fit, its slightly smaller than normal vests so you should order 1 size higher than what you think you need. aside from that it was a great purchase, worth the price which is excellent as well .P.S. the tie was perfect for any color i wore aside from the vest."
4,Good item!,"Received the vest and tie in a timely fashion, product was accurately described. No visible flaws or damage. Thanks!"
3,Happy with my Vest,I ordered this Vest for my wedding and it fits great. I look very elegant and my future wife is happy also
2,YOU'RE ONE OF MY TWO FAVORITE SMELLS,"The film is suppose to be a spoof on Mexican western serials...I think. Pecos Kid (Ken Roberson) and half-breed Apache Yellow Hair (Laurene Landon) the offspring of a rare ""legitimate"" rape pregnancy, search for the Aztec gold based on a map on a deer horn. The bad guys want the gold too. The gold is protected by some not so friendly Native Americas.The cast of characters are introduced in the beginning and tells you the events leading up to this point as if you are watching a serial. The comedy in the film misses the mark as does the acting and script in general. DVD is slightly grainy too.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Some minor killing and torture. ""R"" rating? Seriously?"
3,Good deal,"For the same money, we could have rented this outfit. Why not buy it. No pockets though. Could use 1."
4,they are great at his time,from me a vieuw words about this early sixties group in my opinion is it nice and easy lisstening music i like that music from the begin of the band started greetings from dutchonline@hotmail.com
2,For the Amature,"In all fairness the book did have a considerable amount of information, but the information was geared to the consumer or novice...definately not for the nail tech. There was little information regarding decorative nails, and again it was all basic information that one probably learned in beauty school. There are definately better books out there contain more knowledge than this one. If you are hoping to learn something new this is not the book for you."
3,nice fluff but no real substance,"Although this book has some nice pictures, I think it's lacking in detail. I wanted to know what brands of products are being used."
1,Blahhhhhhhhhhhhhh,Who needs a book about NAILS? What a waste of my money and what a waste of paper. I found it boring and painful to read. Although I have beautiful nails I don't need a book on how to take care of them. Borrrring.
2,"Ok I Give Up, How does it end?","This book started off ok. I wanted to keep reading, but it sort of ended. What happened? This would have been a wonderful book if it ended... Things I didn't like : Jake's dark side was taken away too early, Megans attitude suddenly on the last page changed to she can do it all, and i'm still waiting to find out what happened to Micah, and Todd sort of was left hanging and what is the story with Flo, and that guy peters love interest in NY?This story had a great storyline, it was a bit sad at parts but other than not ending any of the storylines it wasn't too bad."
3,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed the book, but didn't seem to quite as good as other books by Sherryl Woods. I never miss reading one of her books. Always enjoyable."
1,boring disappointment,"This book did not do anything for me. I sort of did a qiuck read through. The characters were not very likeable. In fact, Megan got on my nerves more than anything."
3,A BAND OF MUSICAL UNDERSTATEMENT,"The heading is not original, but is quoted in the liner note as being from a 1935 Downbeat review. Now I don't know whether the author was being sincere or diplomatic, but I suspect the latter. The fact is that for the most part these tracks are fairly soporific, an exception being ""Yes Suh"". The acid test of a dance band is does it make you feel like dancing? Sadly, for this reviewer, the answer is No. As to the two vocalists, namely Ozzie Nelson and his wife Harriet, they are both competent but not memorable. So I can't work up any great enthusiasm for this compilation, but those who want just to hear tunes played straight, with audible lyrics, may be content."
5,Set Free!,"This commentary clearly exposes false teachers and false religion. Word by word, MacArthur illuminates Paul's clear warnings and rebukes to the church at Galatia and the false teachers that were binding them in a hell of hypocrisy. A must read for anyone seeking to understand freedom in Christ. If Christianity is making you miserable, this respected teacher's book is a great relief."
5,Great small group resource,We used this study guide for small groups. Everyone in the class received a book. It breaks the book of Galatians into 12 sessions and provides excellent notes for understanding the text. My favorite aspect is the questions that are placed throughout each session... perfect for group leaders to use to encourage discussion. This is a great tool to move a class from studying topics to actually studying the Word.
2,Buy plenty of Duct Tape!,After weeks of pounding the bag the base cracked. It now has three rolls of Duct Tape on the base & the bag leans to it's side when not in use. My advise is to buy something better!
1,Not what I expected !,I was looking for a skinnier and lighter wavemaster for adult woman but what i got was more of a child wavemaster. It is short and although I was looking for skinny i did not expected it to be so thin. Currently i am using it but it gets tipped easily and even smaller woman can knock it down with a simple front kick. If it was a 30 lbs heavier and a Little taller it would be a great item.
3,Nice,Nice but moves around A LOT! Would probably be better with sand but its a good starter bag for me
3,Wish it didn't move,"My 18 year old son who is using this is not a big guy but no matter what we've tried , the punching bag still moves more than we thought it would.It serves its purpose but we didn't not expect so much movement."
3,Fast shipping... Kind of cheap though.,"I bought this product to knock around in my home gym. I used sand to fill the base which took FOREVER. If I wanted to use water, a standard water hose would have taken a lot less time but I didn't want the water to be constantly washing around. The opening to the base could be a lot wider... making it easier for those who want to use sand instead of water. The bag slides up and down on the center piece and when you lock it into place in each of the three different height adjustments it still seems to wobble around a bit. Im a 24 year old female, 5'5"" tall and athletic. I can hit the bag at 60 percent and it moves around a little bit. Overall, the product seems pretty cheaply made."
2,Dissapointed :(,"I was really excited to get this but now that it has arrived I am dissapointed. I am a small girl 5'2"" and when I hit this it moves all over the place! About an inch with each punch! I am going to try sand next and see if it keeps it from going all over :(The foam cylinder is firm but when you hit it it makes TONS of noise. Not good for apt living! If you are on the 2nd floor forget it! Thankfuly I have it in the 1st floor of our place so that helps but with it moving about you dont want to be on the top floor.I put a thin blanket over the cylinder and it muffles some of the loud noise from the punching. That kinds helps. If I can get it to not move around I will rate higher but for now I am totally bummed."
1,DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS 3RD PARTY VENDOR!,Placed an order with them and they shipped to the wrong address. And then they did not return my inquiries as to where my order is. I cannot recommend them. The phone number they have automatically disconnects you if trying to contact a live person. Purchase from them at your own risk. Note this was a large ticket item ($$$) so good luck.
2,It moves way to much!,"I purchased this a few months ago and only used it like three times because even when I'm just lightly hitting it, it moves around way too much. I tried it on carpet and floorboards but it didn't make a difference. I filled it up with water even pass the line but it didn't help. I couldn't get a good workout out of it. Now it's just sitting there taking up space."
2,Very Disappointing,"If you want to know just how great a conductor Otto Klemperer was, compare his St. Matthew Passion with Johannes Somary's version. Both are well recorded, extremely well performed and dauntingly (and I do mean dauntingly) slow, especially to those used to listening to the tempos set by the likes of Otto Max and J.E. Gardiner. However, where Klemperer beautifully sustains the intensity of the performance and keeps an iron grip on the piece's architecture, Somary very quickly looses his way. Very little drama is generated, despite the best efforts of the soloists, and overall the performance meanders along. The result is, unfortunately, a rather dull and uninvolving Passion. If period performance is not your cup of tea, your best bet is either Klemperer's Passion or Ritcher's first (1950s) version."
5,come to me julie grant,"I bought this song in the 60,s and it is still just as magical now as it was then.Ive always loved it and still do.Her voice is so sweet,the arrangement so haunting,Its beautiful,,,Where is she now? Has she a fan club?Anyone let me know Is she still singing?..."
5,"Julie Grant ""Count on me""","Julie Grant is an amazing singer, and this CD proves it. Julie had modest hits in the 60s, but not the recognition she deserved. The production on all the tracks is excellent, and Julie gives a faultless performance.I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves 60s music, or likes Pet Clark, Helen Shapiro, or just excellent pop music!Julie should have been as famous as Dusty! What a performer!"
4,Obscure Gem,"Too similar to Helen Shapiro,overshadowed by Petula Clark,not excatly in the same leauge as Dusty Springfield or Lulu,Cilla and Sandie,Julie Grant was one of those precious and lost never-has-beens whose music sounds good decades later and makes one wonder why she never made it big in the first place.Whatever the circumstances dwarfed her career,Grant had strong and powerful voice and repertoire built on a cover versions of american pop/soul singers - check her ""Up On The Roof"" or ""Giving Up"" - and when she refused to record ""Downtown"" that was unfortuntely the end of her recording career.Pity,because I like her voice much more than Shapiro's or Clark's and in my humble opinion Grant deserves more than to be long-forgotten name known only to a few lovers of obscure pop singers.If you can find this CD (all of her singles for ""Pye"") you would be surprised!"
1,This book stunk,"Now yes...this book had some kind of value. IM not sure what though, but this book stunk. No moral lessons and there was no story line. It was like a bunch of short stories trying to make a novel. Everyone is entitled to their opinion though, but it stunk."
1,NOT appropriate for Kids,This book has horrible language and VERY graphic violence.I cannot believe this book is being required for kids to read in a High School English class!!! I would not have let my children watch this on TV or go to the movies to see this material. I will be filing a complaint with my children's school.
1,Admittedly Fiction -- Yet Masked as Fact,"The book does not convey a favorable picture of the Amercian Infantry Soldier in RVN, which is fine -- if that is the opinion of the author. However, in my view, he depicts an inaccurate portrait, using anecdotes purporting to reveal something of the true behavior and spirit of GIs. His caricatures include facts interwoven with factoids, falsefacts, and fiction -- enabling only those with relevant experience to discern what is what. In my view, the book is not representative. It appears to be an unfortunate product of the imagination of one who apparently does not understand the Soldiers he depicts; neither their actions nor their motivations."
1,Boring,"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. I dont see where this is anywhere near bestseller material. It is written like reading a narrative. I was waiting for the line ""and one day at band camp..."". I do not recommend this book to anyone."
1,horrid,"If i could choose less than 1 star I would. Our child was to read this in h.s. english. I could only read 1 paragraph, my husband 2 pages and we knew there was no way our child was reading it. The language was over the top offensive, and the way it portrayed American soldiers was deplorable. I can't believe this is touted as great American literature, and a need-to read for children."
5,An awesome book,"If you've never been a soldier, this book will make it real for you. If you've ever been an unwilling one, this book will bring tears to your eyes"
2,Just not any resemblance to the Vietnam War,"I realize this book received rave reviews, and I also realize I'm biased due to my own war experience as an infantry soldier in Vietnam. While Tim O'Brien is a very gifted writer, I feel the attention paid to this work, especially in the many school systems, is tremendously overblown. The book does not really teach anything about a real war experience to the younger generation, nor to anyone who hasn't experienced battlefield conditions.War novels with some basis in fact are very appropriate, but those with totally fictitious events don't meet my expectations. Every book about war need not be filled with battle documentation, but the tales told here are in my words ""a bit off the wall.""Dave Simmons - Author""Our Turn to Serve - An Army Veteran's Memoir of the Vietnam War"""
5,The Things They carried,"There are certainly many reasons that The Things they carried is a good book. It not only tells stories of war but it also describes how these soldiers felt and acted. Through the book he tells how they lived day to day with the non-stop movement and the drudgery of how endless their marching seems. This book makes you literally feel the weight on their shoulders and feel the pain that they feel both emotionally and physically. It gives you a whole new idea and respect for how these people lived day to day and didn't give up. There are parts that make you feel sad, and some that make you feel pity. However overall I believe that this book couldn't have been written better. It is a masterpiece of literature."
5,Brilliant,"The Things They Carried, by Tim O'Brien, is a brilliant, brilliant book. I had to read the first couple stories/chapters for school, and it didnt interest me too much. However, during my senior year of high school, i was required to read the whole book. I fell madly in love with it. It is a beautiful book that not only appeals to people who are interested in the Vietnam War, but also people who are interested in writing and literature. At first, the Vietnam aspect didnt appeal to much to me, but the way O'Brien writes just swept me off my feet. Tim O'Brien sets an example of an amazing contemporary author. I have two copies of this book, one that is marked (for school) and one that is nice and clean, so that I can read it whenever I find the time."
4,The human side of war,"'The Things They Carried' is the 2007 selection for the Eden Prairie Reads initiative. I was a little hesitant at first, unsure of how well I'd enjoy a collection of Vietnam War stories. The book is less about gunfire and battles won or lost, and more of a peek inside the head of the men involved - doubt, terror, obsession, camaraderie, death, survival instinct, the psychological turmoil of going home, and ultimately, for some, closure.Although considered a work of fiction, one gets the feeling that all of the stories have some basis in reality. In fact, several times the author refers to himself as being present in the stories. As a reader, I felt some frustrating in not being able to determine what was true."
5,Great Book,"The Things They CarriedIn the book ""The Things They Carried"" O'Brien, the author, has a recollection ofVietnam war stories that has been bottled up inside of him for years. Some of these stories, willscare you, and some will bring a tear to your eye. Most of these stories are related to friends ofO'Brien and his platoon he was in, and some other stories contain romance and drama. This bookis perfect for anyone who is or is not interested in the Vietnam war, it is just a glimpse of the pastof what our soldiers fighting for our freedom have gone through for our country."
4,The Things They Carried,"O'Brien has written an excellent piece of fiction. The problem with some of his readers and reviewers is the can't tell the difference between fiction and fact, even when the author tells them the piece is fiction. So as a reviewer let me tell you. O'Brien's piece is fiction with a very powerful and strong message about being a Nam Vet. He speaks of the pain involved in combat while at the same time playing with the reader's head to demonstrate the mind games of combat. If you let yourself go enough you can feel the emotions his characters feel. If you go too far, you'll get pissed off and might want to become an activist supporting veteran's rights and programs. Go Tim! You did one hell of a job Bro. One Nam Vet to another...so to speak."
5,Simply Stunning,"This is a beautiful book. It's a war book for those who don't like war books, poetry for those who don't read poetry, an inspirational tale for those who don't read self-help. It's amazing and powerful... a must-read."
5,One of the best books ever written..,"If you want a book that will show you body counts and statistics on the Vietnam War.. this isn't the one you want. But if you want to see the effects of the war on a soldier.. if you want to see inside a soldier's mind.. if you want to be affected by a man's soul rather than how many men he's killed.. then The Things They Carried is perfect. This book is one of the greatest pieces of literature I've ever read. It shows the war through experiences, but more importantly, the feelings and reactions of those experiences. It's truly a wonderful book. I can't sing its praise enough."
3,The Things They Carried,"This book was pretty good. I normally do not enjoy reading many books but I could not put this one down. It was unlike any other book I have read and I liked it mostly because of the way it is set up. It is more like a log of what happened in the Vietnam War. All the stories, and sometimes lies they talked about. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a wartime story"
5,A Very Good Book!,"Tim O'Brien's ""The Things They Carried,"" was the best war fiction book I have read. O'Brien made ever thing seem really. The storys he told were fascinating. They kept me in suspense and wanting more. O'Brien told everything as he thought or experienced. Thats what made it good. I felt like i could have been there right next to him. The changing from story's to talking about them and then finishing the stories was the only problem but wasn't enough for me to give it four stars. i would want to know how the srory was gunna finish but then it would switch and i would have to read on to find out the ending to the story. He might have done that on purpose and if so it worked on me enough for me to read on."
3,Interesting but...,"This book is a first person, compelling report of experiences during the Vietnam War by a combat soldier. He writes about true and rumored stories. Much of this content is worth reading but the style is really obnoxious. He constantly stops the narrative to talk about what a story is, what makes a good story, what's true or not true. It's endless. The awkward, clunky commentary was repetitive and shallow."
4,A Multi-Dimensional Journey,"This is a multi-dimensional movement through war/Vietnam and life with all its random unintended consequences. It includes a very detailed inventory of a soldiers ""gear!"": the physical, actual stuff and all the psychological ""inventory!"" I didn't actually fight in Vietnam but, as a teacher, witnessed its horrific impacts on a generation of young people who I taught. Mr. O'Brien lays out those impacts with the suddenness of the random sniper's shot and its lethal result. I was uneasy throughout this read always expecting the worst around the next curve in the jungle trail or the road at home. I think that is what Tim intended..it was a terrible war with loses that we will never know! God bless those who fought and died and those who came home!"
4,The Things They Carried Weren't All Materialistic,The novel The Things They Carried is a very deep and soometimes twisted book base on the Vietnam War. This book invokes many different feelings ranging from anger to sadness to sympathy. This book is well written and Tim O'Brien uses his lagre vocabulary and understanding of human pain and suffering to instill in the reader the best he can the feeling and depression of war. My teacher is making me write another sentence so.....This is a great book. Not to read it would be a grave mistake because this book is great.
4,The things they carried-physically and mentally,"The things they carried is a book that seems to be written with many emotions. The emotions show through in the stories that are told and through the characters actions. The many war stories are easliy related through ""home"" stories that relate the war activities to common, everyday situations. It is a book of heartfelt tradegy and the stories of the lives of the soldiers themselves. It tells of the adventures that they went through in the jungle and the terrible acts that followed. If you enjoy war stories then this book is definitely for you. It tells about the war from the inside out- the way the men saw it. Overall a great book for leisurely reading."
2,"A disappointment, misleading, and a misuse of language","I rate this novel with 2 stars because it gave a vivid picture of what O'Brien thought the soldiers were or should do in times of war.I thought this book was very inappropriate for high school students to be reading yet alone discussing because they carried inappropriate things such as locks of hair and fingers. I understand that this book involves flashbacks, but it had no organization to it and made it very hard to read and understand. Also, it doesn't carry a common theme and had no hint of author's purpose, so therefore in my opinion The Things They Carry was a waste of time and a huge disappointment. I don't understand how someone could sit down and write such a vulgar novel with no meaning behind it. Plus, it wasn;t for entertainment or informational value what so ever."
3,More than a war novel,"This book was so much more than a war novel. He made it into stories on life, and although it was a good book, I certainly did not enjoy it because lots of it was just so depressing."
3,It was Descent,"The book called, The Things They Carried, was an alright book. In a few parts of the book, I spaced out and could not focus on the material and what they were saying. Most of the time when reading this book, it was entertaining. Some of the stories were very intriguing and made me think of what really goes on in war, other parts gave me a laugh. Overall, this is a descent book."
4,A Unique war book,"Unlike many war books, this is not a documentary. It is more of a collaberation of short stories, which are all woven together excellently, even though they cover different subjects, pre-war all the way to post-war.Throughout the book, Tim O'Brien challenges us with sayings that apply even today. One that stands out in my mind is this: ""Men killed, and died, because they embarrased not to.""Through his quotes and passages, O'Brien convey's what the soldiers really carried through the war. Sorrow, pain, remorse, fear, worry, thoughts of home, all these clouded the minds of the many Vietnam soldiers and weighed them down more than anything they physically carried.It was altogether different then what I was expecting. O'Brien wove his stories together with amazing elegance and kept the book interesting. It was a fast read and rarely repetive.Overall, I think it was an excellent book, and would recommend it."
5,The Things They Carried,This book will provide an insight to the mind of a young soilder and what makes him create his responses to later life events. The style of the book will have constantly looking at the front and doubting that it is indeed a work of fiction.
5,Captivating!,"This book, while titled a work of fiction, captured me from the very beginning as it felt so real. It was so descriptive and so well written that I found it hard to believe that it is fiction. Everything reminded me of what my brother and his buddies told me about their horrific experiences in 'Nam. Tim O'Brien has written an extraordinary novel and I would highly recommend this. I really loved it -- much more than I ever expected. I was sure you will enjoy it, too."
4,A Must Read,This book is a must-read for any age. O'Brien's writing is captivating and his short-story style captures serve the book's purpose wonderfully.
4,Great Book,"The book The Things They Carried is an enlightening story about the struggles of the Vietnam War through the telling's of a Vietnam veteran. The story is told in first person and has many side characters but only one real main character. Throughout the book O'Brien tells his story through small anecdotes which describe his experience in the war. This book is a well writ story that leaves a mark on the reader for times to come. I personally will re-read this book again because of the impact it has had on me. If I had the chance to review this book again and tell other young readers, like myself, to read this outstanding book, I would do that. I feel like this book should be read by high school students across the country. It is truly a writing masterpiece that O'Brien has created in a couple hundred pages."
5,Realizations,Tim O'Brien brings about all of those unexplainable emotions out there. Then he let's us understand them with his storytelling.
4,Interesting read. A brutally honest look within the life of a Vietnam Soldier.,"I really enjoyed this one. It was a required read for school and I thought, ugh, not another war novel. But as I got to reading, I was sucked in, not just by the stories within the pages, but at how brutally honest the author was in writing this. It gave me a whole new perspective in the feelings of war vets. I knew they had it rough, but dang. Now I understand my grandpa a little more (war vet from Nam). Anyway, I feel this is a book that everyone should read. One of the best required reading books I've come across in a while. Please read. You will not be disappointed. But I will warn readers that there are some parts within the book that are shocking and can make one recoil, but when you take into account the situations these men were put into, you can understand, or at least, make sense of their judgement and words."
4,"Fresh, Poignant, Thoughtful, Rings True",I really enjoyed this book and found myself looking forward to a chapter or two every night. The author takes us on a ride into war but with most of the myths stripped away. The prose is bare but constructed artfully and in such a way that it reinforces the simple but dire truths about war found in the passages. O'Brien does a wonderful job illuminating the cameraderie of soldiers under fire without resorting to schmaltz. He also underscores the youth of the soldiers by weaving their sometimes callow perspectives and the crushing responsibilities of leadership into the narrative. Strongly recommended for readers who like this genre.
4,Can't put it down,"I gave this book to my significant other, usually a slow and distractible reader. This book is so compelling that S.O. would not put it down, and I had to wait my turn. Not having lived through Viet Nam myself, I did not expect to be moved by a war story - but this ""war story"" is different. It's a fascinating work of art, and an idiosyncratic history of the conflict, and an informal lesson in story-telling style, all rolled into one slim volume. Well worth getting and keeping."
5,A deeply personal exploration of soldiers in war.,"Who would have thought that what they carried was so interesting and personal.O'Brien captured some very personal moments of these brave men, and they became more than the kill count of the war."
4,Picturesque,Powerful and graphic about one soldiers duty in Vietnam. I could picture every instance that the author described with clarity.
3,Good but Disappointing,"I quite enjoyed this book but found it to be disappointing (perhaos my expectations were too high) It reads more like a series of good but not particularly memorable magazine articles than a really good 'solid' piece of writing.Strangely, the section I found most affecting and memorable was nothing directly to do with his Vietnam experiences but was his recollection, at the end of the book, of his first love aged 9.I found myself wishing I was reading an episodic set of tales about his childhood rather than of his good but not particularly engaging tales of the mess of the Vietnam War"
4,The Things They Carried But Lost,"After finishing this book I was able to understand more about what happened to this man during the war. He tells about the hatred and anger that he had for the ""green"" doctor that did not treat him when he was shot. I personally liked the story about how he got his revenge on the doctor because it showed the fear that many of the soldiers felt while they were on watch during the night. This book showed the true fears that soldiers were feeling during their time at war. It showed the true problems that the soldiers faced such as a lack of experianced command, orders that caused many good men to die for needless reasons and fighting among each other for lack of a release of anger and frustration."
4,The Book I Carried For Three Weeks,"As usual, I was'nt too excited to read this so called book that I was forced to read. I took a chance with this one, and actually started to read it, with the encouragement of my teacher. To my surprise it turned out to be a very well written book that i ended up ejoying. The stories of war were touching in their own ways. But the focus of the telling of stories was what i got out of this book the most. It explained the meaning of stories, and told how they could keep people alive. The stories that Mr. O'Brien created in his mind and decided to write down and still tell the reader that they were fiction, had a very profound impact. It showed how he could get a reader so into a story , and make them believe every single word he was saying and then just drop the bomb that it was not real. The only thing that was real about the book , was that stories arent real, they are made up, but we live through these stories, and without them we would be nothing."
4,Psyche your mind,"This book was great. I felt like I was in the book and with the characters throughout the novel. However I didn't like the fact that many of the stories that were told were not true. At the beginning the main character says that the stories are true. This is a lie however because the main character says that the stories are untrue later on in the novel. The book shows the world in its natural state if you can call it that. The characters are depicted in a state of survival and survival only. This novel combines all of the feelings of humans, joy, fear, pain, guilt, and most of all remorse. This novel shows how the use of the story and the way it is told is more important than the facts of the story. This is the first book that I have read that encompases this meaning. That is what makes this book unique and confusing to understand."
2,summer reading,"This book was very interesting as well as very confusing. The book consisted of many war, death, and love stories. Although the book jumps from one story to the other. It's not really a regular novel with a rising action, climax, and resolution. The book doesn't carry a common theme throughout the book. This in turn makes it very hard to understand and follow. I would have to give this book at most two stars because it gave a vivid picture of what O'Brien thought the soldiers were or should be doing in times of war. But also at times I thought it was a little too graphic."
2,My Review,I didnt like the book at all because i really wasnt interesed till the in a book I wuld rather hve book i could red on my own time isted of eacher reding it i probally like it then the stories were great after kiowa died that's what part i got interested in.
1,Dishonest and disgraceful,"This book is fiction. It is bad fiction. Transparent in its true goal of discrediting the Vietnam Veterns who served honorably and selflessly in the Vietnam War, this book obviously is only yet another attempt to attack the sons and daughters in our military. The author calls himself a liberal near the middle of the book. I already knew that. Anyone who was ever in the military can immediately see how the 'stories' he makes up could not happen in the United States Army. I was in Vietnam for 18 months, in the Infantry. The activities portrayed in this book only happened in liberals' imaginations. To allow readers to assume these are 'biographies' or 'reports' or 'memories', rather than pure fiction is dishonest, and probably the only way to actually induce anyone to buy this political rant."
2,the things they carried,"To be honest i didnt like this book very much .It was hard to hold my attention.The book had no real plot it just kinda wandered around from different stories of the things that were goin on by the first person narator tim o brien.there was one story that just told of numerous things that were in his back pack.There were stories where he lost several loved ones.Overall this was just a storie of a man in the viet nam war and many things that he did and happened to him .the book was very inconsistent ,and in that aspect i give this book a 2."
2,Boring Book!!!,"I found the first few chapters explaining the details about the war and the soliders were the only interesting chapters. The rest of the book is boring and a drag to read. Tim O'Brien's writing style is super annoying. First he claims he did something, says he didn't do it, then admits to doing it. You never know what is true in this book and what isn't! He will also dwell on one ocurrence forever and repeat the same information over and over! The one thing he does well is explain things in detail. Overall, the book wasn't worth reading! Boo."
1,Did not care much for it,Started off ok just enough to get me to buy it but lost me after the. First chapter not my cup of tea so to speak
3,Not the best book about Vietnam,I understand that this book is more about the healing process for the the author than it is about gripping stories for the reader. But mostly it is a series of disjointed memories. Worth the few hours it takes to read but I doubt that anyone (other than the author) will see much value in the book. Truely not one of the greatest books of our era.
4,Ok...,"A good book if you don't know much about the military or Vietnam... otherwise, a little simplistic. A few very good stories are thrown in. Some of the other stories are just downright strange. It is good for light reading. My all-time favorite military/Vietnam book: ""Fortunate Son"" by Lewis Puller, Jr."
4,Not Just Another non-Fictional Novel,"The Things They Carried, is no ordinary non-fictional novel. This book classifies the true meaning of war. O' Brien uses excellent imagery, making the reader feel like their really there. The reader will be overwhelmed by this book just how I was. In this novel you experience a war story that has never been created through the author's as well as the reader's eyes. Tim O' Brien was also in the war, he uses a lot of his close relations and experiences in the novel through symbolic people, events,etc. This is an over all thrill and historical novel. I highly suggest it to all those readers who like a little but of everything(love, war, death, suspense, insanity, etc.). I think I have explained myself well enough to make it known that I enjoyed this book and have become interested in the novel's made by Tim O' Brien."
5,Unexpectedly amazing,"This was such a good book!! My college professor was the editor which is honestly the only way I would have ever come across this because he had us read it for class. I loved it. It was so real and easy to get attached to the characters, as if you were reading about friends. Definitely worth trying out if you don't typically read something of this genre."
4,unbelievable,"I gave it to my grand for school reading. She thought it eye opening and kind of sad. Being an avid reader, she enjoyed the read."
4,Poetic Prose,The author uses the things Viet Nam soldiers carried as a vehicle to portray each man and the war itself. Fascinating read. Well written.
5,Our memories are our history,"Very thought provoking. Tim's development of how we create and carry, and tell our history has been very insightful for me. I love reading and found this story very absorbing. The horror, the horror..."
3,Classic O'Brien,"Another good effort by Tim O'Brien, whose work deals heavily with the power of dreams and imagination and their effect on entire lives."
2,I appreciate what O'Brien was trying to do.,"That being said, the book still disappointed me with its total lack of subtlety and redundancy. I found myself skipping through entire paragraphs because I had read them before in previous stories, and I was irritated by the constant, exhuasted refrain, ""I'm forty-three years old, and a writer now...""O'Brien is very clear on the point that, with a true war story, morality and truth are not necessary. I appreciate this, and I give him credit for the fact that his book echoes his own definition of the Vietnam War itself - vague, ambivalent, undefined, and without clarity or consistency. This, I feel he does fairly effectively, but for the fact that he repeatedly reminds the reader that that is his purpose. However, the inconsistency of the book, and the seemingly haphazard arrangement of the stories, made it difficult to follow at times, and overall it felt very sloppily written and constructed."
4,Good Book,"This is one of the best war stories I have ever read. It isn't only about guns and dying and blood, it also has a certain unique complexity to it. Instead of being written as a simple story that goes in perfect order, O'Brien skips back and forth through memories, descriptive events, as well as commenting on himself about writing this book.The actual war events that take place in the story are very interesting. Yes, people die, it is a war after all. The events had more than just actions however. They contained things such as thoughts of the soldiers while waiting to kill or be killed. He shows the true side of what the soldiers are going through not the Hollywood excess that everyone in today's society is so used to. War vets would like this book."
5,Hypnotic!,"Here is one of the most amazing books I've ever read. Reads like a tough memoir but also like excellent literary fiction, and shares many a profound insight about war, courage, human nature, truth, trust, friendship, and a hundred other deep topics.What makes this all the more interesting is the variety of stories O'Brien tells, some read like Chekovian sketches, others like the best of Andre Dubus in a grittier setting. My favorite, How to Tell a True War Story, explores the ironies and absurdities of war in so many ways -- how war changes the combat soldier, how it creates deprivation and desire, how it is both unspeakably ugly and yet beautiful to behold at the same time. Only someone who has been there and experienced these things can write with the authority O'Brien displays here.This should be required reading in high schools and colleges across the land. Ten stars!"
5,The Power of Fiction,"Fiction can capture the feel of an experience in ways that a ""true"" account cannot. Tim O'Brien knows that about writing, and he knew it when he began to shape his stories about Vietnam. I know these things to be true because I teach literature to college students, I teach a course on the war, and I was--like O'Brien's Jimmy Cross--a young lieutenant in Vietnam in 1970. In my view, the title story of this book is the most important piece of short fiction to come out of the war. When I read it, I relived, and came to better understanding of the terrible burden of command in combat. I told Tim O'Brien all of this when he autographed my copy of his book a few years ago. Thanks, Tim."
5,THE THINGS THEY CARRIED,"The title story in this slim book is quite possibly one of the greatest short stories ever written. I have read it, and often re-read it in awe. Tim O'Brien has had his hand and heart in this writing. I found that a number of friends now teaching the art of writing are using it as one of a group of absolute classics that are being taught. I hope this story lives for my great great grandchildren...at least, my grandchild will have my well-worn copy. Many more than five stars, absolutely."
4,The Things They Carried,This was a very good read. This story took place in Vietnam and was about a group of solders on the march. The things they carried were not only the gear on their backs like weaponry and food but also what they had in there heart. Emotions like love and lonliness. The characters go through some really tough times. As the book flip-flops back and forth between past and present it leaves an unfamiliar satisfaction. This book is a really good war story and I would recommend it for any one who enjoys reading.
4,Missing Sentences,"I teach this novel to 12th graders, and it's great. That said, this new Mariner edition is missing sentences that are present in the 1998 Broadway books edition. On page 42 of this Mariner edition, it is missing ""It was a kind of schizophrenia"" at the beginning of the last paragraph. On page 143, it is missing ""He could taste it"" in the largest paragraph on the page. I noticed these when transferring my notes from the old edition to the new. I don't know why this version would be missing parts of a previous edition."
5,Must read for would-be authors,"While this book shines for a myriad of reasons, I found the book an interesting entry on the syllabus of a creative writing course. O'Brien's perspective on truth and creating truthful statements with lies is invaluable to a creative writer."
4,"""The Things They Carried"" is a Great book.","I gave this book four stars because of the incredible descriptions the narrator uses. But there are some vivid descriptions involving a body of a soldier who had been blown up by a grenade. So if you are someone who gets squeamish when reading about dead bodies and blood, I don't recommend this book to you. I do recommend this book to anyone who likes reading different short stories. Also I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in getting a better understanding as to what a soldier goes through during and after the war.By the conclusion of this book, I'm convinced that you will have a better respect for the soldiers at war in Iraq. Even though this book is based on the Vietnam War, you will still get a better understanding of the emotional impact a war can have on soldiers in general."
2,beaus review for tim obriens book,"Tim O'briens The things the carried i thought would be a lot to do with the missions that they went on and would go into great detail about it. while starting to read it I was like okay this most be like a extra long introduction to the story because it seem like all Tim would talk about was and item and what it meant to that person. this story got very boring for me very quick. I love the the military but after this i thought, wow seems like its my dull than all action. All these characters seemed to get a long for the most part sure there were always some mishaps and yelling. this story is very symbolic and does go into detail about things but its pretty boring after awhile. I could almost guess on everything that Tim touched on because it was very predictable, it got old. There were also good moments in the book though. I love all the action scenes where there is war going on. Those type of things intrest me and I could follow the book better."
2,Sensless rambeling.,Parts of the story are great. But many times it's just sensless rambeling. I kept reading hoping that it would remain good. But I finally gave up 1/2 way through.
2,It was like reliving it all,"Having grown up in a household with a Vietnam vet, this book was just too much. I had to read it for my critical thinking class. I found it to be too overwhelming to critique for the class. Ultimately, I did a review of One Flew Over The Coo Coo's Nest instead.I read it all the way through once...picking it apart left me full of anxiety."
4,Well-written prose.,"""The things they carried,"" is one of the best short stories I've ever read, if not the very best. It has a mood, it is brooding, it strikes you, and the language flows.I first read ""the things they carried,"" as a short story, and then found out it was the first part of a longer novel. Though very well-written, the novel felt like a forced extension of the short story. Sort of like the second and third Matrix movies. Not to say it's not good, but if you've read the short story first, don't expect that it's one continous story. It's actually a bunch of stories that make up not quite a short story collection, and not a novel either. Some people can't handle that. I had a little trouble with it.Still, it is very good. It is one of the few Nam works I've enjoyed. It shows off American literature, and what American writers are capable of."
3,What Happened to Nonfiction?,"It's a fairly well written book. However, the best book ever written about Vietnam is GV Short's ""Arc Light'"" It's actually a true story."
3,Class Review,"O'Brien's novel has many strengths and weaknesses.It's strengths are: its use of imagery, details, and easy language. It has a great plot. Because of its structure, a reader can begin at any chapter, which is great for English language learners and others. The book is very engaging and interesting.There is a lot of switching back and forth in the plot time-line. The first few chapters were full of extra details, which we had to slog through, and many of the war stories were depressing.Overall, we'd recommend this book to people who are interested in war and soldiers' emotions/stories. Current military personnel and veterans MIGHT also be interest in O'Brien's novel."
4,Intense and revealing,"I ordered this book because it is a part of The Big Read. Several colleagues and I read it and held a book discussion on it. The conclusion of our discussion is that this book provides a glimpse into a side of the Vietnam war that the average person didn't see. It is written in an interesting blend of truth and fiction - except the fiction could actually be true - it is that believable! One of the take-aways from our discussion is that when placed in a new situation where life and death are at stake, we can and often do, turn into someone we didn't know existed. The companion thought is that who we become is based on what we 'carry' into each new situation - our values, our experience or inexperience, our loved ones - and the list goes on. Only one member of our group stopped reading about one-third into the book because the images were too vivid and extreme. Everyone else finished it and came away with a sense of the intensity of the Vietnam experience on the human psyche."
3,Great beginning but tailed off at the end,"I thought the concept of this book was terrific. The beginning of the book set the stage and delivered a compelling story. But I just felt it sort of tailed off after that. Still, I would recommend this book for the unique idea it put forth."
3,The Things They Carried Review,"Overall, this book seemed very repetitive in parts. Some exact word usage is written over and over which can be very confusing. Some parts where battle scenes were portrayed, some of the details were quite gruesome and gory. The details were a bit over-the-top and left you wondering why they were written. Another thing that made me think about the content of the book is the drug use. I can see it as a bit controversial. If i was a Vietnam Vet then I don't think that I would like the drug use to be written. Reading this can somewhat make you form a generalization about all soldiers fighting in Vietnam using drugs, which I'm sure wasn't the case. The whole telling of stories that could be ""fake"" but could be ""real"" created confusion. A lot of parts I thought, ""I'm not sure why this is relevant"". With all these things being said, I still enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to a friend if I had one."
4,The Things They Carried,"The author has been there and done that, no doubt. This story is not for the casual reader. Serious stuff goes down in the story, and some of the story made me very uncomfortable as it should have. O'Brien is a brilliant writer, but tends to ramble it seems. The ""reach-back"" threads are at time at the limit of that ""leap-of-faith"" needed for consistancy. Still, the book is a great read."
4,A Protest of War,"The thing they carried is a collection of short stories that almost come together to form a novel. The author (Tim O'Brien) Makes you fight to memorize these short stories, and ties them into the other pieces in the book. O'Brien is very descriptive on the short stories and lets you get involved with the solders of Vietnam. He shows the emotion that these guys went through, and how the troop morale was always low. Some guys shoot themselves in the foot just to get out of being in combat, and walking village to village without winning anything. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes war stories, or anyone looking for a book with emotions and action."
4,A compelling story that is somewhat genre bending-a fictional truth,"The stories are amazing and the chapters build on one another and what you thought you knew in one chapter can be recast or turned on its head in the next chapter. The book is a fast read and makes you think about what is objective reality...or is there such a thing, and if so is it knowable. The hero and voice of the novel is named after the author but remember it is a work of fiction and good luck determining what is fact versus what is fiction."
5,True Fiction,This is a wonderful book. It tells the horrors of Vietnam so that one thinks you are really there. Especially if you were not around during that time it gives you a glimpse into the horror of that war. Sweetheart of the Song Tra Bong was my favorite story. In fact at first I thought this book was non-fiction. If you want a book whose stories seem true to life this is the book for you.
2,"My thoughts on ""The Things They Carried""","After reading the book ""The Things They Carried"" I wasn't at all impressed or entertained by it. I say that because it wasn't something I was interested in. The book was about the Vietnam War and the facts about it. It talked very vivid about the scene and setting of the war. It had some what of too much detail to the story. Well not to many people survived the war, and if they did when ever they got home they usually committed suicide because they kept having flash backs of what they experienced. One soilder named Kiawo died in the war after getting stuck and drowning in a puddle of mud! During the war the soldiers were allowed to carried a variety of things. For example, they carried pictures, guns, locks of hair, fingers, bibles, and letters. In conclusion, I don't recommend this book to anyone, unless you are really intrested in war books."
2,The things the carried,"I thought that the book The things they carred was worth 2 stars because it was written well, and got the point across that I believe the author intended. I didn't however enjoy the topic of the book. Since there was not always something that would make you want to keep reading the book, the book would become boring. I didn't enjoy reading the bad things that happened in the war. I do know it is important though to know what has gone on in our history, and they author informed me of that. I believe even though the book was based on a war story, it would have been a lot easier to follow if they did not have so many main characters. I like it when I can read a book and get attached to the characters so that I want to know what happens to them. This book did not allow you to get attached to all of the characters since there was so many. I did though get to know a few characters and when I read about their stories, the book became interesting."
2,The Things They Carried Summary,"In this story, Tom O' Brien describes the things the men carried with them when they went off to war in Vietnam. Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, carried love letters from his crush, Martha. He was in love with her but Martha didnt feel the same way for him. A machine gunner, Henry Dobbins, carries his girlfreinds pantyhose around his neck. Ted Lavendar carries marijuana and tranquilizers to calm himself when needed. Later He got shot and died and while they were waiting for the helicopter to arrive to take his body away, the other soldiers smoked his marijuana and made jokes about how he was probably numb when he got shot form all the tranquilizers. Not only are the men carring physical things, but also their emotional burdens. Most men were in their late teens and early tewnties. and had never been taught any kind of training, so at the end they were relieved to still be alive. The men in the story learn that it is better to be loved, than to lead."
2,The Things They Carried,"The book I read was called The Things They Carried. The book had very detailed description on the Vietnam War. It told of the weapons the soilders carried. Some of the weapons they carried were malaria tablets,mine detectors,and dope that was for them to smoke. They also carried lice and ringworm and many other diseases. It also told how two soilders were killed one's name was Ted Lavendar and it also tells how there lietenant Jimmy Cross continues to blame himself to this day for his death. The story also tells that the soilders carried sentimental objects such as panty hose,pictures and letters. One major conflict in the story is when the soilders get stuck in a small town and there lives are in great danger. When they finally get out of the towm one soilder is dead and a couple other a wounded. In my opinion this book was not very interesting. And it was a waste of time reading."
1,"I found the book ""contrived"" and possessed of a whiny charac","Does anyone ever write negative reviews. As a veteran of almost four years in Viet-Nam, I was very disappointed by the book in its attempts to say, in effect, ""Look how sensitive I am; Oh, I am such a sensitive caring person."" I found the fictional adventures totally without merit and I am glad I didn't pay any money for this book. If you want to read a fictional book about real, adult meaningful ""truths"" concerning Viet-Nam, then read Nicholas Proffitt's ""Gardens of Stone"". If you want fiction, at least he delivers the real thing instead of some vapid, made up mish-mash like this one."
2,SuMmEr ReAdInG,"This book was very interesting as well as very confusing. The book consisted of many war, death, and love stories. Although the book jumps from one story to the other. It's not really a regular novel with a rising action, climax, and resolution. The book doesn't carry a common theme throughout the book. This in turn makes it very hard to understand and follow. I would have to give this book at most two stars because it gave a vivid picture of what O'Brien thought the soldiers were or should be doing in times of war. But also at times I thought it was a little too graphic."
2,well written but not for me,"This is pretty much the kind of book that I don't like. That is a politically focussed story with an axe to grind. It wears its heart on its sleave. The text is provoking and tight, gritty and sincere. For me, its lacking in subtlety and perspective. Yes it tells the story of the soldiers like it was, but its too intense and too obvious. The in your face style of writing is painful at times. I think the reviews written here about this book are excellent, and I can see this book has made a big impact on people around the world."
5,This is a very interesting book!,"the book the things they carried was one of the most interesting books i have ever read. once i started reading it i did not want to put it down. i liked the fact that Tim used real life war stories, because that made the book even more interesting. iam not much of a reader, but this book made me want to read more books by Tim O Brian."
4,My Opinon on the Things They Carried,I thing this book was very informative. i really told you how the soldiers felt. what it was truly like to be 18 and having the Vietnam Conflect going on. I often imagined my father and how he felt during this time. he was only 18 or 19 when he went to Nam.
4,the things they carried,I realy enjoyed the book the things they carried.It is very exciting and action pacted.Tim o'Brien is a very good writter i think and he explans thing well enough to understand what he is trying to say.The Book has a lot of up and downs also and i think that tunes in with everyones life how we are alway changing and having good days and bad days.
2,matts review,"i didnt care that much for the book, thats why i gave it a 2. it seemed rather boring to me. i geuss i just dont like that kind of a book."
2,the russian point of view,"i am 16 years old a yunior in high school.i really don't like to read, and I don't like homework either but in my english class we just finished reading ""the things they carried"".Our teatcher,would read to us every day and would not ever make us read on our own,(well maybe sometimes)but not that often.She would expect us not to fall a sleep and would yell at all those who did.We are done with the book and i don't even know what the heck the book is about.....i think I am going to get the book, and read it on my own time.the only reason I am wrighting this review is because our teatcher made us.When i am done reading the book,and fully understand it i will come back here and write a better review, till then thatnx for reading my review as it is."
4,The Things They Carried,"I like The things they carried, this book keeps me paying attention. It keeps me wondering what will happen next. I like the way that O'Brien, uses the weight. It gives us a sense of what it was like in Vietnam. Us being born in the United States in this time really do not know what it was like to be there. This book lets you into the eyes of a soldier during the Vietnam war. This book shows the us all the sides of the war and of the people in the war. We know all the things that the men in the war carried and why each one of the carried these things. The emotion behind this is strong, it dose not come right out and say it but I do think that there is some. The over all effect of this book is powerful. It lets you into a world that most of us have not been in this time."
4,The Things They Carried,"The novel The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien is a powerful and descriptive book about what men had to go through during Vietnam. Tim O'Brien discusses very descriptively through the whole book; he even uses all of chapter one to talk about what they carried. This helps to emphasize how much weight was on the soldiers during the war. However, he may have over did it when he used a whole chapter to describe it. The Things They Carried are a book I would recommend to anyone who wants to be moved."
4,Read this book,"This book was well deserving of the 1990 Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award. This book was hard to put down after I started to read it. When reading this book you feel as if you are in Vietnam with the rest of the platoon. The stories the Tim O'Brien has to tell are captivating and bring you closer to the characters. The reason why I only gave this book a 4 instead of a 5, is because sometimes the stories in this book confused me. They often refer to the same story in different point of views which took away form the momentium of the book. Overall I enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it."
4,Wonderful,An absolutely wonderful book. Many times it made me close the book and look up towards God with a half smile on my face and tears slowly running out of my eyes. Tim O'Brien rocked my world.
5,The Things They Carried,"O'brien's language is some of the most vivid I have ever come across. He recreates a story through sensory detail unlike any other modern author. This anti-war novel is not a political statement as much as it is a photo album of the men who fought in Vietnam. ""The Things They Carried"" is as close as one can come to experiencing what the American soldier felt in Vietnam. Immerse yourself in O'Brien's prose!"
5,"Not War... rather, the uncertain nature of Truth","The greatest mistake one can make reading this book is to treat it as a ""war"" novel, or as an attempt to evoke the horror and confusion of Vietnam. Perhaps, superficially, these are accurate descriptions, but the reality is that O'Brien is far more concerned with the necessity of storytelling than the journalistic re-creation of a terrible war. ""The Things They Carried"" is a book about the transparent nature of language, and the way we often use our unique abilities to create stories which help us avoid or, sometimes, discover ""truth,"" whatever that might be. Rather than a novel or collection of stories or memoir, it should be read as an essay, and a provocative one. In the end we are left with nothing but a question: Why do we tell the truth and why do we lie... and does it matter?"
1,i didnt understand the book,I give The Things They Carried one star. Because I didnt understand the book. The book jumped from theme to theme and made it diffcult for a high school level student to understand. I dont think this book was approiate for a Junior in high school should read. The book had no meaning at all it wasnt a comedy or a autobygraphy about someone.
1,More Falsehoods/Myths,"This book is fiction, yet I see comments from readers stating that the book helped them understand the war. You cannot read this book and believe that you have a better understanding of the war and the soldiers that fought there. This fiction adds to the falsehoods/myths already written about the war, and unfortunately, some people believe it as fact. I read about 100 pages and toss it in the trash. It's disgusting that some continue to spread falsehoods about the Vietnam War.If you must read it, enjoy the FICTION, but never take what you read in this book as FACT!"
1,My thoughts and feelings of The Things They Carried,"Elaine AudainI thought that the book was not good it should have not been published. I say this because the book didn't have a good introduction, it started off about one of the soldiers and his problem. Like when he recieved letters from a Lady named Martha and he blamed hisself every time one of his men died. He felt that he was giving MArtha to much attention and he didn't even know whether she loved him or not. I felt that it should have started off about the whole group then went into individualality. The book was a little inappropiate and left out a little bit of details. I think that the book had a lot of ptofanity. That's basically it."
3,good book,"I enjoyed the book but the writers style was to have a recurring line to emphasize an idea. I really don't like writing techniques like this. When I read a book I don't want artsy techniques to emphasize a point just give me the facts, the material and let me enjoy the book."
4,Prose or Poetry,"When I read 'The Things They Carried', it seemed almost like reading a poem like 'Paradise Lost'. In fact it could have been printed in that matter. Also thought about all the things carried physically and mentally. So many. A different take on reading about the Viet Nam War and overwhelming like that war."
5,Excellent novel,Let me start by saying that The Things They Carried is an excellent book of fictionalized war stories. These are so realistic that you would never think they are made up. They explained the pains and experiences soldiers endured throughout their time in Vietnam. This book is a must read!
4,Great and relevant book,"The Things They Carried is a great book, full of stories about life and death. It is not just a book about the soldiers in Vietnam. It is a book that talks about before, during, and after the war. The book isn't a normal novel; it is full of vivid stories of the soldiers and some insights into their personal lives. Stories about skipping the war, killing someone, and the death of friends are just some of the stories in the collection of short stories. Although this book was written about the Vietnam War, this book still has relevance today, and probably always will as long as there are wars. Overall this is a very well written book that I would recommend to anyone interested in learning lessons about life."
5,"Thoughts on ""The things they carried"" by Tim O'Brien","This novel captures the horror and heroism brought on through the Vietnam war. O'Brien's theory on bravery encapsulates the Vietnam war, encouraging soldiers to give of themselves to gain. ""Courage, I seemed to think, comes to us in finite quantities, like an inheritance, and by being frugal and stashing it away and letting it earn interest, we steadily increase our moral capital..."" This novel is written in third person, allowing an overview of the Vietnam war. This causes the reader to get different perspectives about the war, therefore creating their own opinion.Shame is also a big part of this book because bravery is held in high regard. The soldiers were young and afraid, but could not turn back because of fear they would be ridiculed and not fight for their country."
5,vietnow,"o'brien takes one simple fact and relates and weaves his life experiences into a book that is a must read for anyone who likes books about vietnam and has a heart. His story telling is second to none. The things they carried represented literally the things they carried in their ruck sacks, their emotions that carried with them in war and the emotions carried outside of war back in the states. O'Brien is a brilliant writer who will make you want to become a part of the book so he could chronicle your story."
3,A decent book,"My review of this book is that it is a ok book but for a war story about this mans experience of the vietnam war doesn't have much war and combat or fighting.Although this book doesn't have much ""war"" is not all that bad."
1,Guy needs a LOT of therapy!,"I've read plenty of Vietnam books, but this one is beyond description. This sicko enjoys writing one long mind-job on the reader before suddenly admitting that almost everything he has assaulted your senses with was total fiction. I pity him but I‘m also disgusted by him and the shameful distortion of truth that he uses for profit in several books like this."
2,A big review,"The main character of the book is the same man that wrote the book. In which the book beings with him telling how he went the the war with his friends and what type of stuff the normaly carried on there long walks throw the forest and rice fields. They where at war with the vietnamese. The book is very descriptive when it comes to the death of people and how the were killed in the war. The soldiers carryed lots of Physical objects, which include pitures of family, letters and special items they also carryed matches, morphine for medical reason, m-16 for protection, M&Ms for there sweet tooth. They really dont carry most of that stuff out to the battled field. The setting is Vietnam in the jungle"
1,Tropic Thunder,"If you liked Tropic Thunder you are going to love this book. If however you lived what the author pretends to, you may wish you could get your money back."
4,The war of a man no longer in war,"This book had many different stories. Of the war in vietnam andhow he feltabout it. The war has left him with many different conflicts. The book didn't set in just one story. But many different stories. In his stories he explains the tourmit of how bad it was in war. Having a best friend and watching them die the very next day. How war was hell for all of them. He explains the evil of war but also the good of war. His stories never made one point but many point of views. He showed the reader many views of other people in the in the war. Some people would tell how they felt in the war. The author just told the truth but not the whole truth. You can't tell a good story with out fixing the truth as the author says. These stories were truth for all of us. How a real human being feels. It brings back the innocent of man kind. This was a great book witch I enjoyed very much.Some parts of the book has a very unique message. I really enjoyed this book,"
4,Visions of Vietnam,"The Things They Carried, a novel made up of a collection of short stories, is an amazing look at the horrors of Vietnam. Tim O'Brien takes you inside the war, giving you vivid images of the death, destruction, and tragedy that occurred daily to the soldiers. The book focuses mainly on the men of O'Brien's platoon, giving you an inside view of their lives, deaths, and personalities. The book makes such a profound effect on the reader because it takes you inside the story, and makes you feel like you are a part of the soldiers and the war. Be ready to feel the emotions of Vietnam. After reading this book, I did not understand why the war happened, or why so many people died, but I did get an appreciation for the men who risked their lives and I know I will never look at Vietnam the same again."
4,The gamut,"Firstly, I enjoyed this book; but, it was a challenge to my empirical sensibilities. I don't have to know exactly which way is up, or whether something is exactly black, but I do want to know what ""did"" happen or what ""coulda"" happened. When ""unreality"" is sometimes more ""real"" than ""reality"", I know I am in the realm of the writer, a fiction writer, a realm in which I am not altogether comfortable. I guess the one, over-riding thing I got from this book is that if military training and combat is a homogenizing process...it ain't! One character, however, is so disturbing I am hoping that the VC have some expert marksmen. Quite moving."
5,Excellent Book,"I had to read this book over the summer for high school this year. I just finished it, and it was excellent. I'm still having trouble believing that it is fiction. It all seems so real. This book really makes a person think and it touches deep down into our darkest fears. It has a few funny parts as well. Read this book!!"
3,The Things They Carried review by Scott Dodge.,"In the story, ""The Things They carried"", Tim O'Brien tells most of his adventure in first person point of view. The story is told in many different points of view.Throughout the story men are being killed and slaughtered in the Vietnam War. A few soldiers would carry certain belongings to keep them sain and strong. They carried pictures, notes, bibles, pot and even pantyhose. The men also would find letters and dog tags or other unfortunate men who didn't make it. They would bring those certain belongings back to there families for a line of respect.This story is a drag-on of tragic and very painful facts and deaths. From men drowning in mud to being shot to death are some of those painful and slow deaths.The whole book isn't about deaths and war. A man known as the captain falls in love with a woman who sends letters to him consecutively. But things go rough throughout the book until the end when he give up and gets the girl."
3,So-So,"The Things They Carried is a pretty accurate portrayl of the events that occured in the Vietnam War. Though told with fictional characters, the book gives us a chance to see the war through several, drastically different paradigms. Kiowa,Rat Kiley, Jimmy Cross and Azar all give us their own unique presepective into the turmoil and agony of war. There were points in the book we're I wanted to stop reading, and then their were other moments that I couldn't wait to see what happened next. Overall, this book simply delivers the reader what they asked for; a strait-shooting, no holds barred, in your face accounting of the Hell in Vietnam. A good historical read if that sort of thing interests you."
5,The Things They Carried - Unbelievable!,"Tim O'Brien, the author of ""The Things They Carried"" is an exceptional writer and praiseworthy. This novel portrays the cruelty of war, and the fragilty of the human mind under certain conditions. The characters in this novel face hardships, which include the deaths of many of their comrades and close friends, yet also teach the reader a valuable lesson.""The Things They Carried"" not only listed the physical and material burdens that soldiers had to carry such as weapons, food, and equipment. This novel listed many emotional burdens that these battered soldiers had to cope with. Tim O'Brien even said that each soldier carried their own ""ghost"".Personally, I highly recommend reading ""The Things They Carried"" because it relates to our lives and also helps us to appreciate what we have now and not take it for granted. Tim O'Brien said ""Though it's odd, you're never more alive that when you're almost dead."""
4,Things They Carried,"In this book Tim O'Brian is re-telling the story of his time in the Vietnam war. The experiences he and the men he served with had emotionally and physically. It makes you stop and think how war really effects those that are sent to fight for our country. When I first purchased this book, I wasn't really sure I was going to like it. To be honest I was thinking ""a war story, not exactly my cup of tea."" Well I admit I was wrong. I was pulled into the book halfway through the first chapter. I am a very visual person and I love the way Tim O'Brian is so detailed in his telling of the story and the people in it. I will warn you though some of the detailed descriptions are very graphic and some of the language is harsh."
3,Another Vietnam horror story,well written no holds barred expression of the writers experiences in Vietnam. Increasingly dark page after dark page. Finallyhad to put it down and stop reading. I guess the author achieved his purpose with me.
3,A lot of boring spots...,Detail will kill you sometimes. It was a terrible war and time of the U. S......but we survived it again.
2,Water Buffalo Soldiers,"The Things They Carried is one of my least favorite books. Not only was it a war story (war stories do not hold my interest) but it was a poorly organized war story. The short story format with O'Briens interruptions about the falsness of the stories led to a broken train of thought. I understood the themes he was trying to get across but I was dissapointed with the way he choose to accomplish it. He dramatized war to the point where all I could think about was the fighting and not the character development. I did however appreciate his efforts to bring the feelings of war closer to us. The deaths of Linda and the water buffalo definately served their purpose in bringing O'Brien's feelings on the war to a level I could understand. If this book would have had a setting other than the Vietnam war then I would have apprecited it much more. I'm just tired of bieng in school and always being told to read war stories, both fact and fiction."
3,ENG LIT,My son is a High School junior and is in a English Honors class and every other month it requires a different book. I don't read these books personally. I buy these books from Amazon because it is cheaper than the Mall book store and more convenient.
2,Violent and graphic,"Superbly written, raw and disgustingly graphic. If you have a strong stomach for graphic violence, particularly for torturing animals then go for it. If not, pass. I wish I had."
5,A breathtaking account of the Vietnam War!,"The things they carried was awe inspiring. It took you in the places of the men. It made me feel there pain, smell their pig stinch, and feel their love. Tim Obrien takes you with him and his war buddies through passages of the Vietnam war. THe things they carried is truely the best war story I have ever read, I recommend it to anyone loving a good war story. You should definately check it out. VERY GOOOD!"
3,"The things they carried, yhe thing they expirenced","THe things they carried by YTim o'brien was an ok book. Not the best of war books but one that will wake you up from reality a little and help you understand their are way mre important thing out there that what you are probaly living right now.A misleading story that will keep coming back to you realizing the different points of view depending on te situation at war. You relate to their feelings, their everyday routine, their frustration wanting to be back home. Always having to see friends come and go, but getting used to death and chaos even though it hunted them for the rest of their lives.By the thing they carried you will find out what this soldiers where and became after war, shocking both their mind and ego.A book with a story thats is up to you to believe or not."
3,"Well Written, but. . .","Tim O'Brien paints a very interesting portrait of the Viet Nam war, especially from the viewpoint of on-the-ground troops. The book is well written and sets forth the life altering experiences of those who serve. The war actually occurred when I was a young adult and I was a pacifist then and still am; I detest all wars and this book underscores my abhorance of the ignorance that produces death and destruction for those who have no power and the enrichment of those who do, the latter who do not fight the wars they design but are willing to spill the blood of others for their own greed and misguided patriotism. This book should be required reading for all those in power who send our young men and women to fight for meaningless purposes, but the principles set forth therein probably would not penetrate the thinkness of their inane brains or their worthless souls."
3,the things they carried,"I thought this book can really pack a punch, especially with those who have little to no knowledge of the vietnam war. This book gives you a very good idea of the soldiers life in the war, such as his envoirment, his situations, his struggles, and yes of course what they carried. I do recommend this book to anybody with interest in the viet nam era."
4,Krista,"This book was very interesting. At times the book seemed to get a little graphic, but It made the book alot more realistic. Especially since in text books It wasnt from a real veterian from the war this just made the book seem alot more interesting then just reading it from a text book."
3,Not my cup of Tea,"I guess I'm old fashioned or maybe just addicted to ""hard"" SF but when I see a title like ""Starlight 3"" I'm expecting some space stories or at least some interesting short hard science fiction - NOT!This stuff leans much more toward fantasy than SF. I guess the lines have been blurred. Oh well, I got it at the library so I'm not out any cash. If you're looking for some fantasy style short fiction then this may be for you. If you're looking for some hard SF, stay away."
4,Bendix MKD1149,"The Part came in the original box and was unopened and undamaged and on time, and as advertised I could not asked for any more except a full front and rear brake kit at the same price HAHAHAHAHA."
1,Review,"i get this product because its says that it fits with my 2006 jeep grand cherokee, when i get it results that it doesnt."
3,Overview only ...,"I am actually happy with this book. Why do I give this book 3 stars then? Well, I am happy with this book because I only look for an overview of distributed operating systems. This book has a very good overview of some modern operating systems: Chorus, Amoeba, Windows2000. It also covers COM-CORBA middleware. In summary this book is appropriate as a roadmap to elaborate further about the field...But..., they are all really only overview, and the book price is too much for an overview book. If only the book costs 2/3 maybe I would give 4 stars for this book. It costs almost the same with Jim Gray's book (that is much much more detail...).I have also found numerous typos in this book, which are very irritating... Prentice-Hall does really need a better editor.I don't give the book 2 stars because it keeps itself inform about the newest technology in the field, and that's the strong point for this book and the writer tries to make humour..."
2,Very brief and abstract...,The matter is too abstract like a technical paper. The author would have spent more time on providing the concepts in detail rather than giving some code. Difficult for students who have average knowledge in operating systems.Buy this book if you want some programming details.
1,STAY AWAY....Poorly edited and very terse,"While this book covers a lot of the areas pertaining to distributed OSes, it is very tersely worded and I have to wonder what monkey edited it. At least 1/2 of the pages contain grammatical errors. Figures are also stunningly frequently mislabeled. There is no way anyone should use this book until these errors are fixed for either a text or their own information.Contentwise, the book assumes that you remember everything from your basic OS class, it doesn't explain ANYTHING that would normally be covered by a more basic OS book. This doesn't cut the mustard because not every professor covers every topic relating to normal OSes in Intro to OS(also, this book may be used at the masters level where it is possible that its been 10 years since the student has taken intro to os). It may be ok for a quickie reference into possible algorithms, but as an actual learning guide it stinks.Sadly, I can't give this 0 stars."
2,Lots of buzzwords and names but no analogies!,"The trouble with a book like this is that it expects you to just know, somehow, perhaps by intuition, what a term or name means. Really good authors like Andrew Tanenbaum relate the concepts to each other gradually, and to real world ideas. This is what I mean that Galli's book has no analogies. ""This is like this, but not like this..."" After reading just a few paragraphs, my head is swimming with undefined names and unresolved references. The end result is utter frustration and no deep understanding of anything. This book looks good but looks are SOOOOO deceiving! Don't waste your time with it."
2,O'Connell compilation is disappointing,"It's a shame there is so little of Helen O'Connell out there that one must settle for this CD to at least hear some of this singer's extraordinary talent. This CD, which runs less than 35 minutes, features O'Connell in three separate outings, 1953, 1961 and 1963. The best tracks are from her more recent recordings, where her unique vocal stylings shine. Her phrasing is sublime in Taking a Chance on Love and The Sweetest Sounds. But frustrating enough is that 7 of the 16 tracks clock in at less than 2 minutes as these recordings are taken of her radio performances. The sound quality is not first-rate either. The longest selection at 3:09 is O'Connell's hit, When The Sun Comes Out. Missing from this work is Star Eyes."
5,U like tennis and success story? You must read it.,"As a coach of professional players and business man I could really relate to the relation that Allen Fox makes between tennis and today's business. If you read one book this year, make it this one. You will really enjoy it."
5,Get this book!,"This is not a book about tennis. As its title implies, it is all about winning...About why we don't always win and how we can increase our chances of winning. This author clearly articulates the reasons why we and those around us often unknowingly sabotage ourselves and the methods that we can all use to overcome these tendencies. He does this without the use of ""physco babble"" and you won't have to run to the dictionary every five minutes. The use of tennis as a segue into a business context is very effective, but you don't really need to know anything about tennis to ""get"" the point. The book is organized into sub-headings within each chapter. These sub-headings are frequently several paragraghs long in which he ""nails"" each point effectively. So the authors offers up his book in ""bite size chunks"", making it easy to read and digest. I've read many ""self help"" books, and this is among the very best."
2,Same old same old,The book is not as much about tennis as I was lead to believe. There is a great deal of information about goal setting and the psychology of sports but I've heard or read it all before. It is nice to have a re-cap but in my opinion I would have rather been reading a summer novel.
1,"""Makin Magic"" .....Remastered???","Hello Music Lovers,Allow me to say from the onset, I have always felt this is P.T's best effort. I would rate Makin Magic a 5. However, my low rating specifically relates to the sound quality of this release. If you're a Pat Travers fan, then you're probably just happy to have this album in CD format and are most likely not too concerned about the sound quality.At the same time, if you are serious about your music and the quality of the recordings you purchase, you will be disappointed to know, this CD was not cut from the master tapes. While I'm sure the record label did their best to cleanup the sound source, there is very noticeable static and noise on the recordings. You can draw your own conclusions as to what actual source was used to ""remaster"" this CD.A Pat Travers fan thru thick and thin, but most disappointed with the sound quality of this ""Makin Magic"" release."
1,Lousy Quality,"This is one of Pat's best albums.It's a shame that the people who've tried to remaster this album, dont have capacity to do so. The highpitched crackling noise is unbearable to me(even with a hearing loss of 25 %). The people who have remastered this gem must have been deaf altogether.If you can get your hands on a vinylalbum, get that one.It can't possibly sound any worse."
4,8-track mania,"nothing PT does is a letdown but this is NOT his best album, An extremly hard to find album called ""HOT SHOTS"" is in my opinion Pat's best all of his older stuff I still have on 8-track and for 17 years I've been waiting for discs - have them all now except HOT SHOTS please remaster this one soon ........"
1,angle grinder,This tool has good power but the on of switch is very poorly laid out and with gloves on it is very hard to find. The lock to change blades is also very hard to use and sometime it takes 3 or 4 tries before it will lock.I have one of the old type and it is a lot more comfortable to use. I would not reccommend this tool to anyone.
4,"Good value, does the job","We were looking for an affordable bath pillow and this one met our expectations. The pillow is easy to inflate (by mouth) and stays inflated. The suction doesn't work very well, but for a short (10-minute) bath session it doesn't matter much. Just prop it up against the end of the tub and lean back. We wedge it in an empty towel rack to dry."
5,Nice bath pillow!,Pillow was larger then expected and terry cloth is nice and soft. Good suction cups keep it in place in the tub without slipping when using it.
1,"Useless items, but pretty looking....",We ordered these based on good reviews and were surprised to find out that none of the pillows that we ordered would stick to the tub. All methods of attempting to secure them was used to no avail. We are left using them as prop pillows and will not recommend this product to anyone.....
3,"Nice color and shape, but ugly embroidery","This bath pillow is the perfect size and shape for a relaxing soak. The color is a nice evergreen, but it is embroidered in white in large letters ""Earth Therapeutics"" across the top."
5,Great!,"It was a great product! I got it for my wife and she uses it every time she takes a bath. I have even used it, it is a lot better than the larger more clumsy bath pillows we have had in the past."
3,Item not as pictured,"The pillow itself seems well made but was not as pictured online. The online photos show it being a solid color, when in reality there is a large, dark ""Earth Therapeudics"" logo embroidered top and center. I was looking for something decorative as well as functional and the logo is just too unattractive for a pretty bathroom."
2,Dont buy....,"This bath ""pillow"" is SO small it dont even cradle My back and I am a small person, its pathetically small, completely not worth the money at all. I have bought other bath pillows off amazon that were better, stay away from this one."
4,"Very comfortable, good quality bath pillow","Lovely bath pillow, with 4 suction pads behind, the terry material is part of the pillow, not a cover, which is great. It is a nice size, supports your shoulders as well as your neck. There is a noticeable medium sized logo which is not shown in the photo. It says Earth Therapeutics. It is sewn in a very contrasting dark green colour on the terry cloth across the front of the pillow near the top."
1,Didn't last,"I LOVED this bath pillow.....for the 2 weeks that it stayed inflated. Then, apparently, it sprang a leak somewhere, because it will not stay inflated. So disappointed."
3,Terry Covered Bath Pillow,I love these bath pillow. They are soft and comfortable. I just wish they would spread out a little more when you blow them up.
5,Very pleased--item is very sturdy,"This pillow is a lot sturdier than similar bath pillows I have gotten which always develop air holes quickly and deflate. After a month of usage, this one still has no airhole. The suction cups don't seem to stick well on the back of the tub when the water flows into the tub,but moving the pillow in back of one's neck actually makes it more comfortable than if the pillow was in a set position."
2,Makes Sailor Moon Look Like Fine Literature,I have to say that this was one of my worst purchasing decisions to date. This has essentially no storyline unless you're a girl under 13.
3,Clean up your act with Arjuna,"Arjuna is a hard to categorize anime. The animation is pretty amazing especially when they combine some of the CGI and Animation together - specifically scenes with vehicles. The only CGI that doesn't fit is the large ""super robot"" that appears every so often. The plot of the 13 episodes is basically taking care of the environment before it comes back to haunt you. There are a lot of good themes here, but it can really get bogged down and boring. The heroine of the story is a girl who has mystical powers giving to her after she dies and is brought back to life. I would say out of the 13 epsiodes 7 of them include action sequences the rest is on environmental issues and how we can stop pollution and eat better. The extras are okay. The best extras are the Arjuna Dictionary parts. Its best to read the dictionary pieces before watching the episodes as it will help in understanding what is going on in the story."
4,Arjuna what a japan name,"Arjuna is one of the heroes of the epic Mahabharath. His name means a ""Doer of Pure Deeds"". He was the third of the five Pandava brothers, and the youngest of the three children borne by Kunti, the first wife of Pandu."
2,"Good Looks, Lousy Performance","This garlic press looks good on paper. With its interchangeable plates, you can adjust the size of the pressed garlic - a great idea. But this contraption is so big and cumbersome, it's a mess to use. Not to mention the fact that it's just too easy to pinch your fingers between the handles as you press down - foolish design. So while this sure looks good sitting in the drawer, it's not a practical kitchen tool, and I'd suggest sticking to Oxo or Zyliss or another tried-and-true design."
3,okay press,seems to waste a lot of garlic. need to use 2 hands to press it through. a $5 mini chopper would do a better job with less waste and less money.
4,$11.99 for 18/10,This is not as comfortable in the hand as the easily flaking Zyliss. It is probably safer to not eat aluminum flakes with one's garlic. It is very hard to press out the garlic from this unlike the flaking Zyliss.
3,it's a good product,"I want to have it long time ago since I always use garlic for my meal. I like it immediatly when I first see it at amazon. It is all steel and easy to clean. More important, it dose save my time and strength to prepare garlic without cutting."
2,always looking for the best deals but very disappointed,"I thought that I was truely pleased with this ink cartridge . The quality of ink was superb for the price . So I thought .I didn't even spend $10 and it's like I bought the regular HP ink which would have cost me around $20 to $30 . So I really saved big time . But in a matter of 4 days , I was truely disgusted with this purchase . I used the ink for my all in one . I only used it to fax documents ( 3 times , 3 little pages ) and only receiving 3 fax confirmations and on the 4th document my confirmation page was blank . I know that 3 little confirmation pages did not drain all that ink from a fresh ink cartridge . Never again will I purchase from this company . What a rip off . I guess costing under $10 , what was I expecting . :("
3,Can't beat the price,"I have been using this ink cartridge for over a month now and it has been functioning as good as any original manufacturer cartridge I've ever purchased. The price for this product can't be beat. I have used other ""re-manufactured"" cartridges and was never really satisfied. Some had to be primed over and over. Some just never worked. Some were not filled fully. Some were streaky or left lines. This looks like the best one I've ever used. I'm ordering another one now just to have it before I run out of ink.EDIT: I have used the 2nd cartridge that I ordered and it's not quite as good as the first one. Disappointing but still usable."
2,Ink cartridge is not recognized by printer or indicates it is empty,Each time I try to use my printer several things have happen and keep occurring...1) message that there is no ink2) message indicates the cartridge is not the right one3) the printer keeps printing the test pages over and over4) have to turn off the printer each time I use it to trick it into using the inkI believe I will not order re-manufactured cartridges again.
2,Very substandard quality,"I honestly didn't have a very high expectations from a highly discounted post market item - just needed it to print a text, but it prints only half of the line on the image portion (barcode), and text lines are smudged and not legible at all.The shipment from the seller was free and prompt.I just requested return, hopefully they will be able to exchange it for a better quality product. I always give a seller a benefit of the doubt and see how they would handle an exchange and the outcome of it.I will post comments on the customer service and the rest of the transaction later."
2,Very inconsistant,"I had bought this once, and i was pleasantly surprised, as i worked just fine. Perhaps it didn't last as long as the original ink cartridges, but for the price, you couldn't beat it. I ordered it again as my cartridge was getting low on ink. The printer wouldn't even recognize it. I am quite tech savvy and i tried a million different ways, but sadly, no luck. A completer waste. I am sadly going today to pick up an HP cartridge. You gotta do what you gotta do."
2,Cartridge Print less than OEM HP 27 Cartridge,"I bought the Dataproducts HP 56 cartridge many months ago. It is supposed to be twice the capacity of the HP 27 cartridge. However, it did not last as many pages as my old HP 27 cartridge. I am very disappointed with this product."
4,The sizes runs small,"Amazing but didnt fit, I would recommend 1/2 to 1 size larger than you normally wear. The sizes runs small."
5,A miss pulled order:,These were supposed to be a backpack and were returned. The return was easy and I was able to find another option.
5,This book is very well-written and down to earth,"This book is very relevant for those who have removed themselves from their families and friends for whatever reason, but is also relevant for those who are waiting for loved ones to return to the fellowship of families who love them. I especially liked the first person writing style because I personnaly know Linda Fulkerson. It was as if she were speaking to me. Linda lived on the same street as I did when she was growing up with her brothers. Her mother and I worked in my mother's office together. It has been many years since I have heard from her family. Many things have happened in my family...I have a prodigal son who has returned to us after a period of estrangement. Her words, ""you can go back home"", are an encouragement to anyone going through these circumstances. Great job, Linda!"
4,Thanks AHMM!,"I have subscribed to both Alfred Hitchcock and Ellery Queen for years. EQMM is usually a notch better in quality, but AHMM is the avenue for new writers to use more often. As such, the quality of writing is more erratic, but the stories are often more adventurous and the voice a little fresher. Not only that, but AHMM has a monthly contest which is fun and challenging for writers at any level, and a monthly logic puzzle which is always entertaining."
5,Hitchcock Lives!,"I have been subscribing to Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine for many years. I find it an excellent periodical. The genres range from humor, cosies, hard-boiled detectives, to locked room puzzles, with an added dessert of a ""Mystery Classic"" at the end of every issue, some dating from the 19th century. I especially enjoy the absence of gore. The stories are just the right length to satisfy your ""mystery craving"" before bedtime. Another kudo: the AHMM is notably hospitable to aspiring short story mystery authors."
1,"Not So Much ""Mystery"" as ""Misery""","During the 1960's, when my sister subscribed to AHMM, the stories mirrored the fantastic television show; the stories were primarily mysterious, creepy, and unique, with lots of murders and the twist endings that made the show so great. Now, the majority of the stories in the magazine are plain, uninteresting ""detective"" stories. I subscribed up until about the early 1980's, but stopped because of the same old boring ""cops and robbers"" material. I tried to read a recent copy while waiting for my aunt at the beauty shop, but switched to one of the media rags instead when discovered that AHMM hadn't changed. Subscribe only if you are a fan of pure ""police"" fiction."
1,A disappointment,"Sure I like a mystery- who doesn't? But when you a read a magazine like Hitchcock you end up losing faith in the short mystery story. The tales are hard-edged and lacking in style and substance. We seem to have a wealth of mystery writing talent but time and again Hitchcock Magazine is a disappointment. The value for money is horrible, the magazine is printed on newsprint paper and the ink just needs to be touched to smudge- Alfred Hitchcock would not be proud."
1,Poor Quality,"How bad can it get--ask the folks who put this magazine out every month and charge gullible subscribers $39.95 to read this stuff.It seems they are relying on their old reputation to try to sell subscriptions--but this magazine is a pale shadow of its old self. Today AH Magazine, has the same old mystery stories in each issue with tired out old plots. I will definitely to try to cancel my subscription."
4,Niche Product,By mistake we bought some Nano accessories for our Video IPOD and thought got stuck with them but luckily when I searched I found this product. It works greatly. Only disadvantage to using this is I can't plugin my car charger if I use this at the same time -- but I can live with it.
4,I thought this book was excellent,I think that this book was excellent. I have never read a book by Joan Hohl i usually read Diana Palmer or Sandra Brown. But this book was great the hero in it was wonderful and kept you on the edge of your seat.
1,Lame.,"Not worth the time or money at all. The plot is very pointless with nothing interesting or exciting. The story is about a spoiled brat who gets everything from her absentee dad and dating-holic mother. She is the type of girl who doesn't believe in long term relationships and likes older ""men"". Until, of course, she meets Tad and falls in love with him.Terrible! don't waste your time with this one."
1,Doesn't Last on Tongue,"Bought this on the rcommendation of a pharmacist for a sore on my tongue. It does numb the spot, but doesn't last anywhere near what other reviewers are claiming. I get about 10-15 minutes of relief at most, then it just disolves away. Maybe works better on a canker sore, but not on a tongue sore. I guess if you could completely avoid touching your tongue against anything inside your mouth it might last longer, but that;s pretty much impossible, so I can't recommend it at all for this use."
2,Not comfortable and cheaply built,"For all the praise given by other reviewers, I would expect an excellent product overall. However I find that my pair of SR225 headphones squish my ears against the hard speaker grill. The pads are not deep enough. In addition to that the wires on the headphones came torn up out of the box. That's not what I expect when paying $200 for headphones.The headphones sound OK, but since they hurt when I put them on my ears I don't use them as much as I could."
5,Impressed!,"I am VERY impressed by these headphones, especially for the $200 price tag. They are very detailed, even at very low volume levels, and the bass is not overkill. I have listened to mostly blues and classical so far on these, and I actually think I like how these sound better than I like how my (far far more expensive) speakers sound! I've got about 10 hours on them so far, not sure how long they take to break in but I love them so far."
1,Awesome...when they work,"I really like these headphones....when they function. I bought these to use as monitors at the church. After about a month one side died...then the other about a month after that. I got them repaired under warranty. A couple of months after the warranty was up, one side died again. Now both sides are out a second time and no warranty. For such expensive headphone I expected better quality. Very, very disappointed. I would not purchase from Grado again or point anyone else toward them. Perhaps I just got a bad set, but they've been really bad."
5,ride on the town.,as my third set of cans my Sr-225's are reserved for my bike. mainly because they are open dynamic and it allows me to hear traffic while moving between cars.when my ATH-W1000's have been on too i also use my sr-225's due to the ease of listening.ill make this short -recommended.
2,"It's too much hype , cheap looking !!","I bought this product by looking at the amazing review but looks like reviews are written by employees of grado !! Its amazing how minds can be manipulated and here in USA its a big time business.. This product looks so cheap and all of my friends started laughing at me when I say its 200$. This could easily be the cheapest looking headphone with 200 $. Comfort is probably the worst part along with build quality , cheap plastic sucks !! BUt to be fair sound quality is good even though i don't think its something very very special. I bought this from amazon and within 2 days , my left side can falls off. At first I thought its being designed for removable but I didn't see that for my right side ear cup..I thought of returning it but I am in no mood to go through hassles as I am too lazy .. Hopefully I will try to fix it through glue or something but other owners please write proper unbiased reviews and don't mislead prospective buyers like me.."
5,Stunning and unique,"I picked this CD up while on vacation in Los Angeles while traversing through Little Tokyo--this was definitely a lucky find. I also work as a massage therapist, and typically, I prefer to burn my own CDs as I'm not fond of the usual 'waves and birds chirping' tracks that you find on most 'relaxing' CD--this manages to bypass all that as it's a mostly instrumental track list, with light vocals that blend right in with the melody of the instruments."
5,I like it allot,"This is a good cd for teaching and performing tai chi, also good for yoga, qi gong or just relaxing.I think you will like it."
2,Given as a gift,"When ordering this, I didn't realize that it was 6 separate boxes. I guess i didn't pay attention to the description when ordering. No problem, everyone in the family received a box for a gift for Christmas!"
2,This shark is full of baloney,"I purchased this shark toy for myself as a ""I Have Quit Smoking For Two Days Now"" motivational reward, and I'm not quite sure it was worth the investment. I feel that the statements this shark makes may be misleading when interacting with this toy [parents, take heed and consider!]: Shark toy claims to ""make no sound,"" yet tells me this in an audible voice. Rather misleading. Shark toy also claims that its head shape aids in swimming, hearing and sight but upon throwing into the bathtub, shark toy did not swim, hit the faucet and didn't listen to me when I told it to ""be careful, you will hit the faucet."" Also, toy has some durability issues -- becomes very soggy when wet, may produce mildew. I am not sure that I would reccommend this toy to children, parents, OR recovering smokers for the reasons listed above, but your mileage may vary."
4,So much more than a toy,"I was feeling down for a while and thought I'd buy this shark to cheer myself up, but I'm thrilled to say I ended up getting so much more than that. It seems silly to talk to a toy, but after just a few days with that cuddly body and those soft black eyes, how could anyone resist? Leonard that's his name isn't kidding when he says he's a good listener - I feel so much better after I talk to him about my problems, because he's always there for me and he really, really understands. And like any good friend, when I get too caught up in myself he's not afraid to distract me with an interesting fact about himself! I've learned so much about both Leonard and myself, and that's something I could never put a price on."
5,One of the best!,"Amazing, This game runs just as good or better than the windows version of the game. I have corel linux deluxe os and I had no problems with installation. Smooth, never had any slow downs on my 200 mhz machine with 64 megs ram. Highly recommended."
1,Does not work,"It does NOT cut through the plastic as advertised. I'm returning this item. This was the only reason I purchased these scissors, is to cut through those heavy plastic wrapped products."
5,Cutting Multilayer Wet & Dry Fiberglass,"This compact tool is particularly good for accuately cutting wet multilayer fiberglass which has been wetted out between sheets of painters plastic. The small cutting head does not separate the wet layers. After use, the cutting head can be snapped off and cleaned in alcohol. This is a huge improvement over ordinary hand scissors. Large diagonal cuts on dry fiberglass become trivially easy."
1,Not happy,"I charged the item for 14hrs and it worked, but when I went back to it it would not work and would not charge. Had to send in to be looked at."
1,It Stinks,"It does not do what they imply it will do in the commercials. I bought it to open bubble wrapped packages. The cutters do not open wide enough to get started on the package. It was $20.00 unwisely spent. The worst part is that I bought a pair for a gift and a pair for myself, so I was double times a fool."
1,Stink for fabric,"I initially loved these scissors, but fell out of that fast. The charge ran down very quickly and now they won't hold a charge at all and are less than a couple months old. They do not cut fabric well - it gets gummed up in the scissor head and you end up ripping the fabric trying to get it out. I will fork out the money for another professional pair unfortunately. Don't recommend these at all."
2,"Okay, but...","When I first got this, it was great. It would eat through most cardboard, plastic packaging, you name it. Then, and I don't know how it happened, the battery got extremely weak. It barely holds a charge and needs frequent recharging. Now, it will surrender less than a quarter of the way through a job, if that much. It's still fine for ""light"" cutting tasks, but don't ask it to do any more than that."
3,Great Paper Cutting Power Tool,"Perhaps I was expecting too much from the tool wizards at Black & Decker when they introduced the B&D 3.6V Cordless Scissors. Ergonomically perfect, but truth be told this product simply cannot negotiate plastic clam shelled packaging. With limited results, I tested the fully charged scissors on sail canvas. The battery was in drain mode after about 30 minutes of continuous use. I'll go back to shears. No longer in the 30 day return window, it looks like I am now the proud owner of one great looking paper cutting power tool."
1,Junk - Arrived DOA,"Bought for Christmas. When opened it won't charge. The instructions tell you to not return the product. Call the Black and Decker 800 number. But after calling, waiting until they are in the office (M - F 8:00 to 5:00, weekdays only - no holidays) and then waiting on hold for half an hour, they tell you to return it. Nothing they can do. It's probably a dead battery."
2,"When it worked, it was fine. Doesn't hold charge","Add Black and Decker to a growing list of companies resting on their laurels (The others include HP, Craig, Westinghouse, Etc.) These companies USED to make good quality products. However, since most of their products today come out of those quality powerhouses like China, the Phillipines, Korea and Malasyia, you get junk instead. This product is a prime example. When it worked, it worked ok, it cut through most blister packs, which is what I bought it for, however, after owning it about a year, and using it a handful of times, it no longer holds a charge and is now a paperweight. And yea, just TRY to get good CS outta B&D. They'll ask you for a receipt you threw away 10 months ago, and expect you to pay to ship it back to them, costing what the thing cost in the first place."
2,does not cut,"I had this item a few weeks and it runs fine but does not cut hardly anything, so I am sending it back. Will not cut fabric or heavy cardboard. I got it to cut open those bubble packages and it does ok with that but nothing else.MBR"
3,"Fun, but not always functional","The power scissors are nice to use when cutting with scissors can be tough or annoying. I tried using it to cut the plastic container of a product I bought, and it kept stalling out. So even the plastic on a container was too much for the little scissors. Still, they will come in handy often when cutting long areas (wrapping paper, quilting, etc), but they are not a super, heavy-duty cutting machine."
2,Don't expect to cut open blister packs,I was disappointed because I bought these to cut through blister packs. Should have read the reviews here first - they barely dent the plastic before jamming.
4,Good product at a good price.,"I use these scissors quite often for cutting fabric at work. Works well. However, after time the blades do dullout, as is to be expected. This will be my third pair. Recommended!"
4,Black & Decker SZ360 power scissors,"Prompt Shipping, product as advertised. Works great and runs quite a while on a charge. Would easily recommend this item to anyone looking for a quality, inexpensive portable power tool."
2,"Enjoy Them Until You Need Parts (Less than One Year, FWIW)","Sure it's a fun product, and sure they cost about $20, then after less than a year of use, you'll be cutting a really thin sheet of plastic, and a blade will snap off. Then you get to order the blade assembly through DeWalt, and pay $12.50 for replacement blades and $10.50 for shipping!If you do the math, you'll realize it's cheaper to throw out the handle and buy new Power Scissors.If you like that kind of wastefulness, this is the product for you!I'm sorry I bought them, I went back to Exacto blades."
2,Cordless Scissors,I bought these to open products that come in the impossible to open hard clear plastic. These scissors stop when trying to cut anything other than something flat and I have yet to open anything packaged in hard clear plastic with them. Work great on paper but that was not my reason for buying them.
1,Save your money!,I bought 2 of these to use strictly on fabric - with the idea of having a back up charged at any given time. Both died and wouldn't hold a recharge after running down the batteries the first time I used each. I was very pleased with them initially as they worked quite well. Also bought as a gift but did not get any feedback on them. I hope they didn't fail as mine did and the recipient was too embarrassed to tell me. I expected a lot more from B&D and learned a lesson about buying discontinued products - I am pretty sure the reason they discontinued this model is because the units are rife with manufacturing defects.
5,Excellent gift,"Once again Black & Decker has produced a tool that can be used for home, office or in your work shop. It is great at cutting fabric, paper and other lightweight items. Holds a charge well and is extremely easy to use. Highly recommend."
4,cordless elctric scissor,These are far more bulier than I thought they would be but work well on large stacks of fabric so cn't complain. They do vibrate against the cutting table but cut clen and sharp piees.
2,Disappointing,"This tool ground to a halt when snipping across a heavy posterboard. It struggled to get through plastic, too. I gave it away."
2,Will not cut,The only thing they will cut is paper i tried to cut some plastic off of a package would not cut it.
2,BLlack & Decker Cordless Electric Scissors (purchased at Amazon.com),"I bought this item to replace an older model, in which the battery was frequently running down. Unfortunately, the new one is showing signs of battery weakness early in its charging cycle. I was hoping that Black & Decker might have solved the problem I had experienced with the older model scissors, but it doesn't look like they have a handle on it with this model, either.One positive aspect: the price was reasonable."
2,Disappointed,"This product couldn't even cut through the packaging it came in. I'm sure it'll be good on paper, but it's not good with plastic packaging."
5,No more battling with plastic containers,I bought two of these over Christmas time for presents and ended up keeping one for myself.It works great for cutting into several things but I mainly use it to cut into the hard plastic packaging that often comes with electronics or things that are 'high theft'.
3,Great while it lasts . . .,"These scissors are quite useful and fun to use, but the battery no longer holds a charge 11 months after I purchased the scissors. I will look into the warranty but at least it is only $20 to get a new pair. They don't work on all materials you may need to cut, the blades tend to hang on flimsier materials. Useful for opening shrink wrapped plastics, etc., but the blade points are intentionally dulled (probably for safety) but as a result you can't poke a hole to start your cut. Good for some stuff not so good for others. I would recommend these given the cheap price and I would have rated them higher if the product had lasted longer."
4,Electric scissors,Handy product for opening those hard to open plastic packages. Workswell on fabric too. Helps one that has trouble with reg scissors.
4,solid and long-lasting,"This item was purchased to assist with Christmas wrapping. I gave it a work out this past week, and it delivered as promised. I went thru about a dozen large rolls of wrap, and 5 spools of tape, all one a single charge! Granted, cutting wrapping paper should not be a daunting task, but this item clarly saved me much time and effort.I also opened several blister packs. This proved challenging, but with minimal effort, I did get the hang of it. Cutting into cardboard boxes (many from Amazon) was not difficult.Finally, I dropped the item a couple of times. However, is was not affected by my clumsiness. This is well worth the price (under $15), even if you use it only occasionally."
2,Not good enough,"Cutting cardboard which is what I mainly use it for is not the breeze it should be. It bogs down, slows down runs out of juice and all sorts of operational glitches.Disappointed!I am still looking for a machine like this, but with more power.This one just does not do it. It will sit in your garage gathering dust."
1,These things suck! Battery life is terrible! Mine died within a year.,These scissors always seemed to lack the power necessary to cut anything but paper. The power source was always very weak. The battery ended up dying on me after very little use. Not happy with Black & Decker! I expect more from their brand! They owe me a refund for selling such a crappy product!
4,Surprised,"I was very surprised when the scissors arrived, I gave them to my wife and she has been happily cutting material for sewing projects, since we received them. I sneak it every once in awhile to cut open plastic,etc. and they work terrific. Good investment and does what it is suppose to do, CUT."
1,Not up to claims,"This tool was advertised as a way to cut into the plastic that covers everthing that is bought today, but it dosen't do the job. as for cutting paper ect its ok"
4,"Works great, but battery failed after 4 yrs","Bought this item in Feb 2006, and the battery just failed. It will not hold a charge any longer. But, I was so impressed with it, I just ordered another one. I do alot of Amazon shopping, so I have a lot of boxes to cut up to put in the recycle bin. It also works great on thicker cardboard...like the ones TV's come in.I will read the directions more carefully this time. I never left it in the charger. Only charged it when it needed it. I wonder if it would have been better to leave it connected to the charger 24/7 ??"
2,"Works great, till the battery won't hold a charge","I've gone through 2 of these now, so I don't think it is a problem unique to my first one. This little gadget worked great opening clamshells. It hangs up easily so you do have to be careful how you use it, but not a bad gadget. But, the battery stop holding a charge within a few months of purchase. Since it doesn't work at all when plugged in, and I don't generally want to wait hours for the battery to charge so I can open a package, not so great. And since the battery cannot be replaced, well, you get the idea. Pretty useless. I am going to try some other gadget. Hopefully I'll find something that I can keep on hand. I see one that takes replaceable batteries. Better idea..."
4,I need a charger for my sz 360,"my wife accidently threw away or misplaced the charger for my sz 360. B & D website and others say its's not available anymore. I've also called some srevice centers, same answer. Isthere a place where I can buy a charger? my email is gaceec@yahoo.com. thank for any help on this. gG Codnner, Jennings, La.I haven't used it much to give a review. my wifde is the one who used it, because she had carpal surgery..."
2,NO REPLACEMENT BLADES!,GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE FIRST WEEK OF CUTTING...THEN WHEN BLADES DULLED...FORGET IT!!!! THERE ARE NO REPLACEMENT BLADES FOR THIS UNIT...BUY ONE THAT HAS REPLACEMENT BLADES!
3,Super Snips,"The item works great. However, two improvements should be made: 1. reduce the noise during use. 2. provide a mounting assembly while charging."
5,Finally! An ANSWER,"to opening all those horrible plastic packages that things come in today with ease! These scissors are a God-send. You can whip through any problem or wrapping so easily... cuts plastic, cardboard, paper, anything that's tough. Good, too, for those with arthritis!!"
5,Simply The Best,These scissors make great gifts! I can't understand why they are so difficult to find in the stores. We use ours for everything around the house. Your days of struggling to open items wrapped in thick plastic are gone!! For people with arthritis or older people these scissors would make a wonderful gift. They are Simply The Best.
5,Love at first cut,"I cut some carpet and with a straight line, no cramps in the hands from regular scissors, cuts screen and a breeze with cardboard, not to mention the long life on a charge, bought a pair for my neighbor for xmas so I could get mine back,lol"
1,Buyer Beware,"The positive reviews were so glowing that I gave it a try. I couldn't cut cotton, much less tile or whatever some of the materials are that were mentioned. I kept it only because it was too much trouble to return it. Maybe one day I'll need a fancy pair of useless scissors to cut some paper. Maybe it will do that."
1,B & D SZ360 Scissors,"I ordered the item because it was cheaper to buy a new one compared with buying a battery for the old one. Luckily, I did not throw the old one away. When the new one arrived, I charged the battery the recommended time, and when I went to test it, NOTHING!. So I removed the battery from the new one and put it in the old one, SUCCESS!. After checking for loose, broken wires in the new one, I discovered that the motor in the new one was faulty, you had to manually spin the shaft to get the motor to run. So, now I have my old one with a new battery and an extra scissorhead if the old head gets dull."
1,Dead battery on arrival,"I bought this product for my husband last Christmas, 2010. Right off the battery charged and the product worked. But as soon as the battery needed charging a second time, it wouldn't take a charge, despite charging it exactly by the instructions. So, this product worked great for one good round usage of the battery. I purchased this product again this Christmas for my husband in hopes that the first one was just a rare battery problem...because when it worked, it was great to use. Well, this new product's battery wouldn't even take a charge right after being first opened. And yes, I had the product in ""off"" mode when charging the battery and charged it for more than 12 hrs like it recommended. The battery was no good right from the start, so I returned the product. Black & Decker needs to fix this battery problem."
4,Everthing I Expected,"I remember my mom having 'electric scissors' as a kid and thought how much easier it would be it I had a pair. These are even better! Lightweight, cordless and easy to use. The only real drawback is the noise."
4,good power scissors,altho it mentions other heads for purchase - for thicker cardboard I couldn't find a merchant that sold these accessories.
5,B&D Electric Scissors Work Fine,So happy I ordered this. Works just fine and a big help to a slightly arthritic thumb. I might want another set of blades to keep one for fabric cutting and the other for paper and rougher use. Probably best to turn off the scissors when done to hold a charge longer. A real help.
1,Bad,"First scissors battery died after a few years - but only very minor use during that time and battery always died in-between uses.2nd set bought a couple of months ago - didn't need to use right away, when went to use them after charging they were already dead, the handle was warm but the scissors never worked - no response from seller. BEWAREMajor waste of money."
3,black & decker scissors,Purchased these for cutting fabric. Worked great at first. After a few months every time I went to use them I had to recharge the battery. I used them maybe once a week to cut one sewing pattern. Battery would not keep a charge. Now it will not last through one sewing project without needing to be recharged. Disappointed in the battery life. Wish they put the same battery they use in the new drills - that lasts forever!
4,"Fast, be careful with children.","First, these scissors are powerful and fast. (I wonder if a speed control was considered?) Like a professional speed control switch,rather than off / on?They can zip right through a magazine, like 'Time'. Cutting it in half in a second or two.The only real problem I have with the design, which is nice, (maybe mine is flawed), is that the lock button on top,doesn't spring back to locked automatically, leaving the device dangerous if 'little hands' are around.The reason I don't give it 5 stars. Safety is important!Don't leave these near children, or where they can get to them!I can imagine these could cause a nasty cut.EDIT:These were great for a couple months.Now, It may be my fault (as a man, it usually is), but, they're completely dull,and I find my self searching for my manual scissors.I must get new blades, or toss the thing....That's all.P"
4,"great scissors - if you are a crafter, you want these","I LOVE these scissors...they are quick, smooth, and easy to use. If you are a crafter or scrapbooker you want these. They don't cut through really thick things very smoothly, like cardboard...but they are great for foam or felt or paper- great buy."
5,Great scissors for tough jobs,These are great scissors to use if you want to save wear and tear on your hands when tackling tough tasks. I bought them specifically because I needed to cut several templates out of thick plastic. I thought at first they were too delicate for the task but they worked like a champ. Saved me several hours of work. Don't know how long they will last but they did the job I bought them for. They work great for cutting open the blister packs that many items are packed in today.
2,Not quite as good as advertised,We tried to open a few of those plastic encased packages at xmas but had to resort to a pocket knife to get the job done. The ad shows these electric sizzors zipping through all kinds of plastic wrappings leading one to believe they are wonderful. The sizzors do well on straight flat cuts but not too good on anything with a sealing wrinkel or tight bend in it. This product needs a bit more work on it before it will live up to it advertised claims.
2,Save your money,"The main purpose for these scissors was to open plastic packaging and they are not strong enough to do the job. Even fully charged, they just stall out when you start to make the first cut."
3,"Good for most things, but not what I bought it for","Like most people that gave it 3 stars, I bought it to open those annoying plastic vaults in which consumer products are entombed -- however they remain impervious to all attempts at cutting."
2,Not Powerful Enough,"But then again, what should I expect on a Gold Box Deal for ten bucks?My overall opinion is that, ""This thing is garbage."" At least that's what I've said to my wife time and time again.I bought it for one purpose: those molded, plastic packages that everything seems to come in these days. It does a decent job if you're cutting straight and if the plastic isn't thick. However, if you're trying to cut into a tight corner of the package or if there's any ""meat"" to the plastic, it just grinds to a halt. I have taken out my Cutco scissors more times that I should have needed since purchasing these.I haven't used it for cardboard, but based on my experience with plastic, I doubt it would do much for corrugated board. I also haven't used it for paper products, but I'm sure it would suffice in most cases. It just doesn't do a good job on molded, plastic packaging."
4,review of electric scissors,"Excellent product. I'm a seamstress and couldn't do without it. One problem. The battery doesn't remain charged long enough and I'm never sure how long I can keep it on charge -= overnight or only a few hours. Could use guidance on minimum and maximum times for ideal charging.One further suggestion, this item should be sold in fabric stores and not just at Christmas time - all year long!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Thanks,Maureen Edickmaureenedick@gmail.com"
5,Great gift,My grandmother really enjoyed these scissors. She has arthritis and it helped with wrapping Christmas presents. My sister wanted one because it can be used to cut through plastic packaging that make it so dificult to open toys and electronics.
1,HORRIBLE; MAYBE I HAVE A LEMON??,"This scissor makes noise and that's all it does. It barely cuts a piece of paper. I bought it (and 7 others, too, for gifts) mostly to cut through the hard plastic wrapping on gadgets. The scissor DOES NOTHING. It will absolutely NOT GO THROUGH the very outer edge and once you get through, it barely goes through the single layer of plastic that covers the object. I also had a strong 22-year-old guy try it and he came to the same conclusion. I already told 2 of the recipients that this thing is a piece of crap, don't bother opening it, and play dumb and regift it to another sucker."
1,Pure Junk!,"I'm not sure these things would cut toilet paper, much less the plastic blister packs they advertise. So far, I haven't found one they would cut through yet. Cardboard? Forget it! Black and Decker isn't known for quality, and their flashy products are geared more for the noice to gather dust with. I wouldn't even trust them on paper or any thin cloth, as you lose all the control you have with a good pair of hand scissors. I'm surprised they haven't had to withdraw their claims for these. Save your money and invest in a couple different pairs of quality scissors."
3,"Confusing at first, but functional","It's very important to charge FULLY before you try using these.If not fully charged they won't work. The 'confusing' is that the blades don't fully come together, when you'd expect the blades to meet in a pair of scissors. With these, the top blade just sort of vibrates in the upper position.Works great for some things. I've successfully used them with thin cardboard and clamshell packaging, to quickly cut a clean straight line in contact paper and window privacy film, as well as gift wrap. Don't bother with heavier cardboard or complex/thick plastic packaging. I'd be inclined to give them a higher rating if they were a little tougher.All in all- worth it for the price (sale on Amazon). Probably wouldn't pay more than $10, maybe $15 for them."
3,Decent,These would be most helpful for older people and only just kind of fun if you're able to use scissors easily. I find myself finding ways to use it just to use it. I'm sure it will come in handy around Xmas time. I'm only giving 3 stars because it does not cut through plastic casings as easily as I had hoped. Note: This goes on sale to close to ten bucks. Keep an eye out.
4,Yikes! Why has no one posted where to get the replacement blades?,"Took me forever to track down these blades. I can't believe no one has done this previous to me and saved us all the work by posting where to buy them here.Well here ya go - work done.Here is the elusive part number, which you need to have to order replacements from DEWALT's website (even though they are Black and Decker, you get the replacements from Dewalt.)Part #5140027-49 Blade Assembly ""Shoe Blades"" $7.20http://www.dewaltservicenet.com/Products/ProductDetails.aspx?pid=62275&tid;=14211"
2,Not What I Expected....Unfortunately For Me,"I saw this product on a christmas commercial where a woman had to open a child's toy that was covered/wrapped in that awful clear plastic. I have two young children and it is such a pain in the neck (and hands!) to open all those christmas toys vaulted in plastic. So, I thought these scissors were my ticket to an easy morning opening all those christmas present. Unfortunately for me, the scissors were not strong enough to cut through the plastic vault it came in! Ugh. I ended-up returning the scissors. If you want to cut anything softer than plastic, then these are great scissors for you!"
1,dont buy,I lost the charger to this item and they dont make it anymore.In fact they dont make any spare parts for it or the unit either.So no way I would even buy this tool.
3,Review Cordless scissors,"Found out this product was manufactured in 2006. Black and Decker no longer makes them or has replacement parts. Original battery did finally charge, but battery will never be able to be replaced since they don't make them anymore. If I would have known that this product was outdated and not available to parts, may have selected something else. It is working for now."
4,Too much hype on the B&K description.,"Will last 70 minutes on cutting? I don't think so, even my Milwaukee and DeWalt with the larger 18V power pack cordless tools won't last anywhere this long doing real work. Will cut almost anything? It won't, having problems just cutting the thinner plastic box it came in. Higher end vinyl flooring, forget about it. Battery is way too weak for cutting plastic boxes and takes much too long to charge.With that said, it cuts paper and surprisingly cloth really fast and clean, much better than I could with a good pair of manual scissors. Would have been 5 stars if the battery were stronger and faster to charge."
3,Wish It Had A Longer Battery Charge,"Okay, I like to use the cordless scissors for cutting up boxes to put in the recycle bin. I've used them to cut Christmas wrapping paper. That was very cool.I tried to use them to cut open one of those ""clam packs"". I thought that would be a great use. Either they are not beefy enough to do that job or my battery was too low. Either way, it wouldn't work.As long as I plan to cut up boxes on a certain day (or whatever) and I charge the scissors ahead of time, it is okay. I have never been able to take them out of the drawer on the spur of the moment to use them. You might say they need 24 hours notice!!So I like my cordless scissors, but I would like them a whole lot better if the battery lasted longer."
3,Qualified recommendation,"I purchased this item to open those numerous packages wrapped in tough clear plastic that I used to open with a sharp razor blade. An electric scissors would be effective and much safer, I thought. My experience with this item is unsatisfactory as it seems to be unable to cut through the edge of those sturdy plastic packages. The scissors does cut through cardboard and regular paper nicely."
4,Works well,Makes short work of corrugated cardboard and those infernal plastic packaeges stuff comes in these days.
4,THIS THING IS AWESOME!!!,"I wouldn't suggest this for use of paper, but it comes in use with fabric. I create my own fashion designs, so this is really handy cutting off a yard, or long seams like pant legs and long sleeves."
5,Black & Decker Cordless Scissors - Excellent Product,Outstanding product. Functions as described. Good battery life. Cuts just about everything and a lot easier on the hands.
5,Powerful Scissors,"Finally someone produced an electric scissor that will cut more than a single sheet of paper. I have tried many and this one is the best and most powerful. Great for opening tamper proof plastic packaging. Cuts everything I have tried it on, even the stems of roses. Great product."
1,"Don't Buy These Scissors, They Don't Work!!!!","Black&Decker; SZ360 3.6-Volt Ni-Cad Cordless Power ScissorsI bought 2 pairs of thesescissors because I thought I finally can get all those"" impossible to open"" plastic packages opened easily,and I thought how great they would be for my art projects, cutting fabric, etc. No such luck, they worked forabout a day, cutting easy things like paper & fabric (if you hold it perfectly taut). As I read in another review, it never did cut the blister packages, not even it's own!!! It just kept locking up when you tried to cutthings. It would not even cut thin foamboard!!! Now, it has just died on me, no movement at all. It would be a great product if it worked, it doesn't!! Kim White"
3,Black & Decker Power Scissors,"I charged the B&D power scissors according to instructions, the item did not work! I have since returned the item for refund."
4,Black & Decker Power Scissors,Bought these for my wife to help out with her endless scrap booking projects. They work as advertised...they will cut through anything and also give you the nice clean edges needed for scrap booking. The only complaint is that my wife can not use these when the children are asleep because they are louder than I expected.
5,Great buy,"I was surprised how easy it was to use the Black and Decker power scissors. I bought three of them on the Golden Box deals on Amazon for $10 each. I wasn't sure if I had made a mistake since I had not tried them. But when I got them I tried one and it worked wonderfully. I was zipping through cardboard boxes, etc. one after another and opening packages with no effort.It did not come with the fabric shoe accessoryBlack & Decker SZ360 3.6-Volt Ni-Cad Cordless Power Scissorswhich would have been nice. But hey it was only $10. You can buy the complete kit at Home Depot for $20 with the accessory."
5,Worth Buying Again,This is one of my favorite tools. I can cut the heaviest cardboard boxes with ease. I just ordered my second B&D SZ360 Powered Scissors. My first one is several years old and the battery will no longer recharge. I'm looking for a battery if anyone knows what to order.
5,Wonderful Product,"This is my second set of the B&D cordless power scissors and I absolutely love them! I haven't found anything (not metal of course) that they won't cut with the greatest of ease. I use them mainly for fabrics and they are super quick, easy to handle, and zip around outlines without a problem. I highly recommend them. The ONLY complaint I have is that the battery isn't replaceable. I got a couple of years out of the first pair but when they quit holding a charge I found out I had to buy a new pair rather than a new battery. A bit annoying but they are too good not to get another pair. I just hope B&D never quits making them!"
5,Great,These scissors are great for cutting out material . I'm an avid sower . I just love them. Relieves hand fatigue.
3,Black & Decker electric scissors,Great product but overseas buyer should be made aware of the fact that the electrical charger requires a 240V charger which I had to purchase from Australia at extra cost therefore making the scissors a really expensive product.
4,Excellant product for the price,I own a small cut & sew operation and these scissors work very well for cutting one garment at a time.
2,Battery life is definitely a disappointment!,I bought this product with the expectation that it will cut easily without too much manual intervention. But I must say this isn't one of Black & Decker better product. The battery life is a complete disappointment though.
1,Unsatisfactory Performance,This amazon replacement for Epson T009201 Color Cartridge was not usable in an Epson Photo1280 printer. Black came out brown and solid colors came out striped.
1,can you give negative stars?,"seriously, I'd like to know. this ""book"" deserves negative stars. It looks like it was published by a vanity press."
1,"Love It Or Hate It, Phrenology Is A Courageous Effort","An early work from one of America's most nebulous thinkers. Phrenology's hocus-pocus will entice or bore depending on the reader. If you like the first five pages, sit back - the text is remarkably consistent in both style and mood. Quintessential Martinez."
1,Just don't buy it,"If you are searching for a book on phrenology that could provide a working frame or methodology, even history or scholar essay this is not the book. It doesn't follow any systematic frame and it is absolutely useless."
4,white truth! for equal proportioning,"when i first bellied up to the author and asked him if he was trying to expose the sully underbelly of the midwest world he tried to kick me in the teeth, a place where high school beauty queens turn up years later looking tired and ragged, the very definition of hill street blues, dating the abstract algerbraic burn-outs who stopped being able to perform away at college and now find themselves exiled on main st with a paranoid android wearing a dog's collar was no place for me he said. he gave me a bus ticket to california and bought me a coffee, he's a true gentleman and i'm glad i bought his book. i now know what i never will be missing."
3,Accuracy Is Critical,"I recently purchased a Starrett C635-1000 ruler and a C635-500 ruler. When the 500mm ruler is placed next the 1000mm ruler I have noticed that the 500mm one is a clear 1/2mm short of the 500mm mark on the 1000mm ruler. It seems a large variation to me but maybe this variation is within the tolerances of the manufacturing process. Perhaps my expectations of Starrett were unrealistically high but, funnily enough, I'm now in a worse position than when I didn't own a 500mm or 1000mm ruler because now I don't know which one to believe!"
1,Very Disappointed!!!,"I placed my order for 2 boxes of this Watermelon Laffy Taffy, with seeds. I didn't buy 2 pieces of it because I ""thought"" I knew what I was getting. I ""thought"" Amazon would be a more commitment oriented corporation. For what I recieved...... I got 2 boxes.... 64 laffy taffy's watermelon flavor, and it did NOT have the seeds. I wouldn't have ordered $56 of laffy taffy if I wanted the WRONG one. The picture on the website is definitely not the picture of the laffy taffy I recieved. I for one am very ashamed of the service I have recieved and warn all others to steer clear of this product if you are looking for the taffy with the seeds.... this is NOT the right one."
1,false advertisment,"When i bought this product it said in the information, watermelon laffy taffy with seeds. When i open the box and start to eat one, NO seeds, i was quite made cause the whole reason i bought it was for the seeds. If i wanted a regular watermelon laffy taffy i could have gone down the street to the gas station and picked one up. If i would have known that i would not get seeds then i wouldn't have bought the product. I wanted one with seeds and i did not get any. im disappointed."
2,Policewomen,"I bought this video as one who is a martial arts officianado. Unfortunately, I would have to say that though they may not have used many stunt doubles, all of the punches were 'pulled'. This movie certainly did not rate near as well as say a 'Cynthia Rothrock' effort. For the most part, I think the story line held together, and I think, contrary to some other reviews, the scenes we 'believable'. If you are looking for a movie that has a little action with some story, this is a good one. However, if you are looking for some hard hitting adrenaline pumping action, you might want to check out 'Tigerclaws' or another action packed movie with Cythia Rothrock. Another good female action star is Cory Everson, though she has not done near as many action films!"
1,Book of Lies under cover of psuedo science,"This book was basically unreadable. It was simply white supremacy wrapped up in fake and unprovable science. I can't believe this idiot has a degree in anything much less in nueroscience, probably doesn't. I noticed that he loves to talk about ""white power"" in his reviews, he is pushing a hateful agenda and not true science. Run do not walk away from this piece of trash."
3,Not very impressive,"What kind of expectations can you have for 20 dollars though, really?Vest is small for size. Entire thing has a plasticy feel. Buttons seem fragile, although I have not broken one yet.The tie seems alright, but I don't know if I would wear it solo because of the pattern. It looks ok with the matching vest, alone it looks silly.What you will be getting is a cheap vest with this product, and expect it to be a little small if you order your normal size.If you don't care, and basically need something to just get by on rare occasions this could be for you. If you need to dress up a lot and don't want others to think you are trashy, cheap, or just not fashionable you should probably get something else."
3,nice cheap vest- button fell off first time,"order one size larger- I'm typically a 2XL, but the 3XL fit fine. Cheap tie- I havn't worn it. Came fast."
1,Do dont buy,Dont bother buying this. The material are so bad that i didnt even got to wear it before one of the buttons fell off.
1,HORRIBLE Customer Service,The company sent my package to the wrong address and when i asked them if i could return it and have another sent to MY address they rudely said no.Very unhappy.
5,GREAT!!!,I received it in a timely matter. It is going to be perfect for my soon to be husband in our upcoming wedding!
3,vest,more like a medium. didnt fit so i had to order a new one shortly after. decent material though. its okay.
2,Everybody is wrong...,Everybody said sizes run small. They don't. This set is priced very well. I suggest you buy 2 different sizes you may fit into. Return the one that is a no go. Tighten the one that you keep until it's secure. Good luck!
4,"Great vest, shoddy sewing","This vest is great. It looks so good with a black tux, or even just a dress shirt. I'm a percussionist, so sometimes tux coats are out of the question because of the way it limits movement, but this still looks very professional. I ordered a medium size, which is my shirt size, and fits perfectly. My only complaint is about the fact that one of the buttons popped off my vest on its first use. I was only walking around, normal activity, and pop, down an elevator shaft, so obviously, not retrievable. These buttons are hard to replace, because they are cloth buttons with the paisley print on them. I hope the seller will send me some more buttons.All in all, you should buy this vest. Don't let my bad experience with the button keep you from buying this awesome vest and tie."
3,BEWARE OF SIZING!!!,I live in the U.S. and wear 3XL shirts. I saw some comments about sizing being a size small so I ordered a 4XL vest/tie combination. It was still too small! The buttons were an inch from closing. This sucker does run small!
4,OK quality,"I like wearing vests with jeans/casual slacks and this vest is pretty nice for the price. I usually have issues with size as I'm between a small and a medium. After reading the reviews about sizing, I went with the medium. I wish I'd have gone with a small. I also like the light weight feel. I wouldn't wear this for a more formal occassion, but it's ideal for casual wear."
2,Beware of the size,I can get into most 2X-sized clothes without a problem but I thought I'd play it safe and go a size larger. The 3X vest is really an XL at best.
2,got what i paid for,"I got what I paid for, which was a nice tie and a shoddy vest. First of all, I love the tie, it's worth the price I thought I was paying for the vest. However, the vest is like 2 sizes smaller than what the tag says, doesn't matter because I'm losing weight anyway, but anyone else buying this needs to take that into consideration. My real gripe is with the buttons. The first time I tried it on, before I even closed the vest up with the buttons, one of them broke off. They ar made out of very cheap and flimsy plastic. I replaced them with better buttons that actually make the vest pop more."
2,Buttons Broke,"The buttons literally broke into pieces within minutes of my husband trying this on. Yes, it was a little snug, but it shouldn't have been, because we ordered the size he normally wears. Regardless, the buttons shouldn't have shattered. It was for his Halloween costume, so he used it anyway. You get what you pay for. If you plan on wearing this for a one time event, go for it. Otherwise, invest in better quality."
2,Nice craftsmanship but poor sizing,This vest was well crafted and looked great but the 4XL was several inches smaller than any other 4XL garment in my wardrobe. I would have happily taken a larger size but they said it was their largest size.
5,A very wise book from a very wise man.,"I read this book years ago and had occasion to attend a lecture Sam Keen gave in Dayton, Ohio. I was already immensely impressed by the book, but I have to say that the experience of listening to him live and being able to ask him questions, confirmed all my expectations about him. He is an incredibly wise and sensitive human being with much to offer men, and I believe women, as well. For men, this is MUST reading."
5,the classic affirmation of men's experience...,"....and a positive step toward healing the gap between men and women. Also a good intro to men's studies in general. Not tremendously deep or profound, but gracefully written and very useful for men's groups."
3,Not bad,"The basic tenet is what every self-help book ever written says, in essence: the outer world can't provide a satisfying life the way a rich inner world can; in order to find a partner and have the strength to stick with a relationship, you need to have a whole sense of yourself; it's important to de-program yourself from the lessons you learned as a child and come up with your own answers to life.It's a little heavy on the white man's burden, the WASP who's never questioned anything, and some of the concepts are definitely outdated, but the general idea of the book is pretty timeless. ""Iron John"" was definitely a better read in the same genre (Robert Bly being a poet and all), but this one was all right. I'd recommend Keen for someone who wants accessible concepts, who might be a bit sheltered about the rest of the world, and/or who's not very experienced in life but who's ready to start questioning things."
2,Fire in the Belly,"I bought this book with a couple of others for a presentation I was preparing at church. I read three or four chapters before putting it down. It didn't really address what I was interested in for the presentation, and otherwise wasn't providing me with any knowledge or insights that I felt was useful. Oh well."
1,Being an adult,"The crux of this piece, as well as that of the frequently[in reviews] mentioned Iron John, reflects the need to pass off what is in reality a personal lack of maturity as a social ill. If people spent as much time reflecting on their own behavior and taking responsibility for their own decisions as they spent reading this book then perhaps some of the true problems facing society could be addressed."
1,Misandry disguised as intelligence,"This book is one long wagging finger at men. Women are these mysterious Goddesses that we must live up to, and men are dumb childish cretins who need to grow up. The book slanders any type of sex that isn't some mystical dreamsoul worship of a women's totality. Our nature to get things done; through reason or violence, is really just the crying of inner little boy wanting his mother. The book represents the sum total of misandry paraded as insightful psychology. Women are enlightened being in touch with the universe and men are mindless dogs who need to be raised up into the all mother. Women being more enlightened is a fallacy kept sacred in this bookMen and women can become greater, but books like this one completely miss the point, merely extend radical feminist talking points.Ironic side note: The Amazon spell checker recognizes the word Misogyny( hate for women) but not the word Misandry( hate for men)- it underlines it as misspelled."
4,"Brave, Bold and Brash...","Those were the traits of the men bred in the land down under and there was none braver than Ben Penrod. Only one thing could turn his sun bronzed visage pale and that was a marriage-minded female. Tough Ben was heir to the vast Australian holdings of Penrod station, he had no intention of saddling himself with a wife...until he met his match in the most alluring and contrary creature he'd ever beheld. With hair like moonbeams and eyes like aquamarines, Tia was only as big as a child, yet her lush curves proclaimed her all woman. With manners as dainty as those of any fine lady, she could charm his highborn friends, yet her salty language would make a Cockney blush. And instead of being pursued, Ben found himself being refused by the one woman who had captured his heart for all time!"
3,2 1/2 Stars,"Sigh. I had such high hopes for this book because of the stellar reviews, but was left cold....and bored.I just didn't feel the chemistry between Tia (hated the name) and Ben. I thought the hero arrogant and overbearing and the heroine unlikeable. I didn't care if they ended up together or not.Not a keeper for me."
5,Awsome Book,"I honestly enjoyed the entire series written by Connie Mason, once I started reading the books I could not put them down, I strongly recommend this book for those who enjoy historical romance and adventure, I promise you won't be disapointed!"
4,I would like to buy it.,"I have a poem in ""The Coming of Dawn"" published by the National Library of Poetry, Library of Congress ISBN 1-56176-045-6 and would like to purchase it. Any help would be appreciated."
1,First prize a copycat!,"This is the resulting book of a contest by the National Library of Poetry in 1993. The first prize was awarded to a person who just copied a Pearl Jam song. The song is ""Garden"", from the album ""Ten.""Here is an excerpt from Pearl Jam's Garden:The Direction Of The Eye So MisleadingThe Defection Of The Soul Nauseously QuickI Don't Question Our ExistenceI Just Question Our Modern NeedsNow check the book and see for yourself ;)"
2,"Pretty Lousy, But It's Inexpensive.","This electric razor does not work very fast or very well, but I wouldn't expect much better for the cost. My beard is very light, so I've always gotten by with low-end electric razors. My previous unit, the Braun 3612, served me for several years, but the shaving foil wore out. Since the Maxisonic was less expensive than a new foil for the Braun, I figured I would give it a shot. It wasn't the best move. The Maxisonic does not shave as close as the Braun, and if you've ever used the 3612, you will know that it is difficult to get a close shave with it. I think the Maxisonic also has a weaker motor.I gave it an extra star for the low cost and the included extra shaving foil. It's also good that the Maxisonic can be used when plugged in. I considered the newest low-end Braun (Series 1), and I rejected it because it doesn't support corded use. This means that you are out of luck when the battery dies, which is unacceptable.As usual, you get what you pay for."
2,Let's see a Collection with Mike Please!,Joel fans have had 3 collections - now it's time to cater to Mike J.Nelson fans.When are we going to see such classic episodes as 'Riding With Death' and 'The Devil Doll'?Very soon I hope....
4,Bonus features! At last!,"At last, Rhino has added some worthwhile bonus features to the MST3K discs. Each of the 3 full episodes in this set come with bonus footage, of alternate takes and bloopers from the filming of the episode. Mind you, none of the bloopers are quite as funny as the ones in Poopie 1 or 2, but it's still neat. Again, the episodes aren't all wonderful this time out: Sidehackers is the best of the three: The Atomic Brain and The Unearthly have some memorable moments (mainly Tor's ""Time For To Go To Bed"" and the lady with a cat's brain) but neither of them measure up to Pod People or Cave Dwellers, from the previous set.The volume of shorts included here has the classic ""Last Clear Chance"" and a couple of other neat shorts - not quite as amusing as volume one, but still pretty good. Still a essential addition to a Mstie's collection!"
1,From Back Cover,"Hell-bent on protecting his family's interests, commanding corporate tycoon Jordan Westcott never counted on crossing paths with the most-beguiling beauty he'd ever met when he decided to spend his summer vacation incognito, helping out his grandfather's struggling Big Top Circus. Unfortunately for Jordan, however, virgin spitfire Mistral St. Michel thought he was only a slick lion tamer, intent on taking advantage of her and the circus she managed. And like a lioness protecting her lair, she wasn't about to let anything --- or anyone --- sabotage her precious labor of love. No man had ever come close to claiming the tempestuous Mistral as his own --- until this dark, electrifying stranger she didn't dare trust awakened a fierce hunger in her that defied all reason. Was it foolhardy for her to relinquish her carefully guarded virtue to this magnificent man of mystery --- or would it be the true fulfillment of all her deepest desires?"
3,Starts our strong,The first few songs on each CD are good then it's just okay from there. I want music and CD's that aregood from the get go and all the way through. This one is okay though.
4,"Informative DVD, but not chaptered","This is an informative guide to growing roses (although it has nothing on rooting from cuttings), but the DVD is not chaptered--it was apparently dubbed straight off the VHS tape.I hope it is reissued in a chaptered format soon."
5,Dark Illusion,"Back cover reads:""I remove obstacles that stand in my way!""Nick Martella wouldn't allow Joanna's love for another man to cause him any problems. Joanna, of course, resisted his high-handed attitude, but it seemed that wherever she went, whatever she did, Nick was always one step ahead of her. It was hard enought to deal with him in England, but on the small Caribbean island Nick called home, Joanna found it even more difficult to outmaneuver him. It was, though, only when Joanna realized that she was not only fighting Nick's single-minded pursuit of her, but her own growing love for him, that her problems really began!"
2,Accardo is interesting---Roemer is not!,"That's why I bought a book I thought would be about Tony Accardo. Instead, I read about tidbits on William Roemer, the author, and not enough conversation or anecdotes on Accardo to form some sort of image about the man. No wonder Accardo hardly did any jail time--he was a hard man to get a handle on then as now."
3,Overall decent,"Roemer rambles too often and digresses from the subject a little too much for my liking, but, the story he delivers is solid and consistent. If he would just drop the justifications for previous FBI blunders in the field of organized crime, and if he would allow a professional to edit his book, then it would be a near- five-star effort. A good read nonetheless."
2,Didn't Keep Me Interested,"Roemer's (the author) writing style isn't that great for me. I've attempted to read this several times, but I can't get engaged because the storytelling just isn't there really. Roemer's book The Enforcer about Tony Spilotro is better than this.Roemer also includes A LOT about the FBI which he was a member of. This may interest some, but it doesn't interest me."
3,"Lot's of information, but poorly written.","If you're looking for a book about the Chicago La Cosa Nostra and want to read some interesting stories and history of the family then this is the book for you. However at times you might get very fustrated with the book. At times Roemer seems to get off track, ramble, on and write about things that are really not important to the topic of the book at all."
2,A few errors,I think the main problem I had with this book was the numerous factual errors in it. I could forgive his overstating Accardo's importance to Chicago organized crime (Its a well known fact among most real crime historians that Accardo spent most of his time as the Waiters front boss) because all biographers tend to do that. But when he states things like Joe Profaci and Joe Columbo being bosses on the commission and showing up at a 1961 wedding when Columbo was an eventual herir to Profaci's family can't be forgiven. Things like that make you wonder if the author knew anything at all.
4,"Fascinating story of the ""true"" godfather of our era.","This book would have rated a 10 if only Roemer would stop patting himself on the back throughout this and all of his books. We know he was a boxer, we know he went to Notre Dame, we know he's one of the best name dropper's of our time and we know what a great FBI agent he claims to have been. Give it a rest Bill and just tell the story! Anyone who grew up in Chicago and paid attention to the comings and goings of the Outfit will be fascinated by the book. It's amazing that Tuna went out from old age and not in the traditional mob exit. If you didn't know Accardo's background you would have thought he was just the guy next door."
1,stay away,i am a fanatic about reading mafia books. this is clearly the worst and most boring book in the genre. stay away. read john davis' book if you want a good picture or sammy bulls. this is also very poorly written.
5,Evidence of the importance of family in Eastern Kentucky,"These memories of growing up the 1930's in a Letcher County Kentucky coal mining community are inspiring, especially as they show how rich the author's family was in love and support while living in poverty. The author's respect for the beauty of the area and its people is evident, and she brings members of the community to life, including the plow man, the mid-wife, and the country preacher. To survive, the family eventually moved to the small New York town where an aunt lived, and where the author met and married a local businessman just before her eighteenth birthday. Her vivid description of her first visit back ""home"" as a sophisticated married woman is bittersweet and hilarious, and that scene alone is worth the price of the book."
4,Takes you back in time,"Once I began reading, I couldn't put the book down. The author transports you to Kentucky in the Appalachian Mountains back in the 1930's. I loved how descriptive the writing was. I plan to get a copy of the book for many of my friends.I went to school in Wyoming, New York (1968-1981) where Rhoda Warren lived as an adult and I knew her name, but I had no idea of her abilities or her personal story. I am so proud of her. She really has a talent for writing."
4,A wonderful chronicle of a simpler time and place.,"""Appalachian Mountain Girl"" flows with the gentleness and innocence of a happy childhood amidst mountain hardships. So nice to read contemporary memories of Southeastern Kentucky in the 1930's before ""progress"" crept in to change the landscape forever. This book lends a romance even to the coal mines which provided her family of 13 children with food and shelter. Thanks to Ms. Warren for sharing her life with us."
4,"Easy, enjoyable read","This little book is packed full of charming and insightful stories about an area of the country that is rarely portrayed authentically. It was a relaxing read and made for good nightly bedtime reading. The writing style is straight forward and full of colloquialisms indigenous to the area. I would recommend this book, especially for those interested in social issues and Appalachia in particular."
2,"English Subtitles, please?","I am about 20 minutes into this documentary and find that my interest in watching further is seriously challenged by my inability to understand what the three remaining brothers are talking about. Three middle-aged fellows muttering into their beards or to their feet or to the middle distance do not make riveting storytelling, if one has NO idea what they are saying in their country accents. My enjoyment and understanding would be enhanced 100% if there were subtitles. It's not too late to reach a wider audience...."
3,"A lover of documentaries, this one was OK","A lover of documentaries, this one was OK. My favorite line in the movie was something like, ""these boys are outcasts, but they are OUR outcasts."" That pretty much sums up why the community rallied around Delbert in his time of ""need."""
2,just ok,"i'v seen a multitude of documentaries, both low and high budget, and although i found the story interesting i felt this film was not up the hype it was given. worth seeing, but not worth owning."
3,Worth watching but not objective,"its clear from watching this that the producers really sympathized with the defendant brother. In fact they skip so much evidence against him that it undermines the film's objectivity, credibility, and much else. We don't get the whole story--too much left out."
1,Five minutes was enough for me.,Why on earth somone made this film is beyond me. I watched about five minutes of it and that was more than enough for me.
5,Excellent,"This film is a must see if you are a documentary buff! Sad, happy, entertaining, and human... overall, an excellent piece of work!"
5,Awakens Compassion,"Brother's Keeper is an amazing movie. Every time I watch it, my heart fills with compassion for Delbert, his brothers and all the innocent people in this world that are caught in circumstances they cannot grasp or change. If I'm feeling sorry for myself- which is absurd as I'm blessed with a healthy mind and body, wonderful family and friends- I watch a film like Brother's Keeper to wake me up to what true suffering and hardship is. It reminds me just how great I've got it."
3,Sad documentry,It is sad how some people can get railroaded into something because they are different or misunderstood. This is why we need to reach out and help others.
3,Enjoyable simple time circe,"This movie reminded me of ancestors, it was a nice reminder of a simpler life timeIt shows how far technology has come"
