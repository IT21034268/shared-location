5,TWANGED,"I am currently reading this, the second time I have read a book by this author. i enjoy the book and the author very much"
1,Boring,"This book in one word - BORING. Having been able to at least finish the preceding books, I really tried to stick with this one but just had to give up. There are too many good books to waste time on ones I don't enjoy."
1,Twanged,"Plot was week. Poor character develpment. Not sure why I even finished the book. I give this piece of work 1 star, only because the option of assigning zero stars was not available"
1,stupid and boring,"I saw Ms. Clark on a talk show and decided to give one of her books a try. Yech! The characters are completely unpleasant, their motivations stupid (because I think it's lucky!! C'mon!) The ending is wholly unsatisfying. The main character we come to really dislike is given an undeserving reprieve at the end, while characters we had no feelings about at all are punished. Regan Reilly is a lousy detective with no personality.As a die-hard country music fan, I thought I'd like this book, but it's obvious Ms. Clark knows nothing about the industry and gave us fans nothing to like. In short, the book seems written on about the fifth grade level and, were it not for the unneccesary twists, inneuendo, and too many characters to keep track of, an 11-year old might enjoy it."
2,Audio Cassette Version Is Weak,"I listed to this book on audio cassette. The best thing I can say is that I finally finished it. Carol Higgins Clark should not read her own books. In portraying several characters, her shrill voice got on my nerves. Next time, get a professional actress to read."
2,A by-the-pool light reader,"Carol Higgins Clark's latest book, Twanged, is a light hearted, easy read, but without much depth. All of Carol's books star Regan Reilly whose life never changes...overworked and in need of a vacation (and a companion!). The main question of this book, what do the initials CT stand for, was never answered. So much emphasis was placed upon the ""stalker"" however, the ending was wrapped up so quickly that he was basically shuffled away. It was almost as if Ms. Higgins Clark was leaving for a vacation and needed to complete her book...the story ended quite rapidly and without much surprise or excitement."
3,Regan Reilly Mystreys Continue,This was a mediocre book. It is not one that screams for a second reading.
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could. Read Rumpole instead.,"This is perhaps the worst mystery book I have ever read. If I was told that it was written for a grade school audience, I would have no trouble believing it. I bought this book because the cover review blurb said something about a cozy full of eccentric characters. But if this is what you want, don't read this book. Instead, for eccentric characters and wonderful writing, read the Rumpole stories by John Mortimer."
1,A waste of time and trees!,"This is certainly the most horrible book I have read in a long time. The characters are dumb and not well developed, although who would want to develop such idiotic characters! I finished this book just to see what a moronic ending it would have. I was not disappointed. This is the first and last book by this author that I will read."
1,My pocketbook was Twanged,"Extremely light reading. Unreal, barely humorous characters. Other mystery writers have nothing to fear except loss of display area on bookstore shelves due mostly to the name in my opinion."
1,A book you don't want to read...,"This book made me put off reading for awhile...until I could come back to it and try and finish it later. The book was so horrible I had to skim through the remaining chapters to try and figure out what happened in the end. After reading this novel I am hesitate on trusting the author with any of her newer books. This book is nothing like Carol's mother's books. Yesterday I read ""I Heard That Song Before"" in one day, and not once did I get tired of reading. I am going to check the reviews of Carol's books before I read another one of them. All book stores should pull this one off the shelf."
1,The material and the characters were trite,"I purchased this thinking it was Mary Higgins Clark and boy, was I disappointed. It seemed that she threw in anything to appeal to anyman - from Don Imus to a wealthy goofball and his sidekick. There was something for everyone but not muck of an interesting story."
1,simply awful,"simply awful audio. the reading was appropriate to a children's story hour. ms. clark, having a high-pitched voice to begin with, alters it for the different characters so that all the male protagonists, including one meant to be a threatening stalker, sound like a cross between the pillsbury dough boy and a chipmunk. the main male protagonist sounds like a moronic pre-teen. his home, described as a castle fit for an amusement park has a wooden deck - bizarre. if, as i presume, this abridged version is the highlights spare me from rest of the book."
1,"Typos, capslock, and fiddles, oh my!","This story is definitely intended to be a light-hearted mystery, and the author does a good job of protraying annoying characters.However, the paperback edition I picked up was filled with typos, which constantly jangled my nerves. Also, Chappy's shouts were always IN CAPSLOCKS! It drove me nuts! Like others have stated, it didn't give a good feel of the music industry (and don't get me started on the extremely dull interview the radio personalities gave...ugh. No wonder their station was doing badly)."
4,enjoyable and easy reading,I enjoyed this book...was a fast reading book without the offensive language in so many other books
4,Not just for college...,"No complex equipment? No space required? No jumping, no jogging, no huffing and puffing? NO SWEAT!I'm not a college student, but toward summer I still have that extra five pounds to shed...and living on a budget in a small apartment does not equal jazzercise. For anyone looking to lose a few pounds or just get into shape, this book is a must buy.The language is simple and complex principles are made easy to understand. The pace starts as slow as you need it. And the cost is the best part!All that's required is a few feet of space, a straight-backed chair without arms (goodwill $10), and two freeweights (another $10-$20 dollars, depending on the weight and quality). AND THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO BUY...EVER!The exercise is as fast as you'll find it, and more effective than you'd ever believe. With this book I was able to tone up and trim down.""Bikinis have never looked better."""
5,This book helped me lose weight and keep it off!!,"This book not only helped me to lost over 40 pounds, but taught me how to keep it off. Four years later, I still refer back to the book frequently for advice on proper form, eating right, and also for a little inspiration."
3,Darrel Gleason,"This movie is hilariously low budget. I first saw it on Lifetime and loved how funny it was. It's surprising that it's rated R. It is supposed to be a serious movie but there is alot of bad acting, a super lame script and even lamer characters, music and plotlines. I'm glad I bought it though because it's a riot."
3,"""Fatal Attraction"" without the budget","Nothing new here; you've seen this movie hundreds of times, only with different actors, different settings (this one's filmed in Vancouver) and under different titles. Jay Underwood is the creepy stalker prying into poor Maryam D'Abo's life as a single mother and desperate restauranteur. You can guess the entire plot just watching its first minute, although, should I ever meet Ms. D'Abo, I'd probably be doing the same thing, so who am I to cast a stone?"
5,Great Coverage,For the Buckeye fan who needs to know more could not be more apt. The articles are great and the coverage timely and complete. A great deal!
5,One of the Best!,Out of all the cookbooks I own I have to say this one is one of the best. I have made most of the recipes to rave reviews.The pizza sauce is a huge hit at our church sale as well.Easy to follow steps and for the most part common ingredients that you are familiar with.
5,"Great recipes, well expressed","This book has a wide range of recipes for all kinds of baked goods. The author is very knowledgeable on her chosen topic, and finds informative and sometimes amusing ways to insert this material. I have tried many of these recipes, and have not had a failure.The book is very user-friendly in its format, and the pictures are very enticing. You will want to try everything, and when you do, you will be very satisfied!"
4,Miss Pym rides again....,"Belinda Goes To Bath is another great installment in The Travelling Matchmaker series. It's fun to see Miss Hannah Pym, the 30 something former servant, who, after inheriting a modest income from her deceased employer, goes on her dream travel, via the stage coach all about England.In this installment, Miss Pym's fellow rider that she takes under her wing is Belinda, who is forced to ride the coach, with her companion, to Bath, to cover up a ""scandal"". After a coach accident, the coach riders are forced to house at the hero's home, the Marquess of Frenton. A series of comedy of errors, scandals, and machinations develop-keeping the hero and heroine apart and Miss Pym on her toes.4 stars-recommended."
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!,"I was so disappointed with Mike Epps because I love him. I there was a zero star rating thats what this dvd would get. But like someone else said, stand up isn't for everyone. It was horrible I haven't even watched the whole dvd yet. I would go out and buy Katt Williams The Pimp Chronicles instead."
1,Just Stick To Acting Stupid In Movies...,"When I first saw this, I could never remember ever seeing Mike Epps doing any stand-up comedy, and after seeing this ridiculous show, I saw why. The man just wasn't funny. The jokes were dry and his routine was just flat out boring. This dvd really dissapointed me since I'm a really big Mike Epps fan and heard he was gonna be in a biographical movie about Richard Pryor. He should just stick to playing the crazy characters he always plays in movies and leave the stand-up to those who know what they're doing."
1,TERRIBLE,"Mike Epps is on of my favorite comedienns, but this was TERRIBLEI think he should stick to doing comedy movies.. Standup is not for everybodyI love mike, But i wouldnt watch this again for free"
4,Platinum Comedy Series - Mike Epps (Deluxe Edition),"If you love Mike Epps, you will love the DVD! He's funny."
4,K.M Acevedo,Mike Epps is a funny dude. He's no Katt Williams but he's funny.I'm very happy with this product. Received very quick also. Will do business again.
3,Mike Epps,"Overall I can say that this was funny. Mike Epps had his moments where you can tell he was trying to think of something to say so he would bust out with something he said in one his movie roles, but he did say some funny junk and this was my first time seeing him do standup so I feel he did rather well. He knows how to keep his crowds attention even if he has to say something stupid and off the wall."
4,"Wild Blue,McGovern","Very good account of the exploits and hardships of the 15th airforce in italy. It roams from the training of the pilots of the time to a biographical narrative of George McGovern. I voted for him and highly respected his WW II action. However, this book covers a bit too much of him, and could have stayed a bit more focused on the 15th airforce. I've read most of Ambrose's war material, and this book has similar appeal. But, it is no Band of Brothers nor D-Day. The part of the Tuskegee Airmen was toching but short lived. And it came ""out of the blue"".Nevertheless, I'd reccommend it for all since, the 15th was rocked with thousands killed, wounded, and MIA. ""It's still the same old storyThe8th gets all the glory"" could have been the Ambrose's main theme if he'd stayed with it."
3,"The Wild Blue Yonder, Yonder, Yonder, Yonder, Yonder","I am a big Ambrose fan, but this one isn't up to the level of his other WWII books. The problem is that the air war was simply not as fluid--as variable--a dimension as was the ground war. For example, enemy flak has little variability: it is a black puff and those puffs are either thin or concentrated, hit or miss. Enemy fighters approach from predictable clock positions, and they either score hits, miss, and/or are hit themselves. As horrible as the WWII aerial arena was, it was a relatively redundant phenomenon compared to the great variability experienced by the ground pounders. The redundancy in this book makes for a fairly weak read. I stress that my comments are literary in nature; it is not my intent to detract from the extraordinary service to freedom rendered by the USAAF (my Dad was in B-17s)."
2,The Wild Blue REVUE,"I was very disappointed.The book seemed to be a series of anecdotes not nicely linked, and the reading of it was choppy.It also repeated a story, about the braking parachutes, like it hadn't been told before. It seemed like a bad continuity error.I think the book was strung together quickly to take advantage of Stephen Ambrose's reputation. He is a much better writer than this book indicates.I learned very little from reading this book, and had heard many of the little ""stories"" and jokes before, e.g., the B-24 that lowered its landing gear and then shot down the German planes escorting it to a landing field.Very disappointing overall!"
1,Down in Flames,"Mr. Ambrose really misses on this effort. His handling of the topic is very superficial and must have written by his assistants. For those wanting to read the real stuff on the B-24, get a copy of ""Log of the Liberators"" by Steve Birdsall. Unfortunately, the author's name will sell zillions of this poor book and keep young people from reading more comprehensive books on the WW2 air war."
1,The Wild Blue,"Way too many technical errors. Slow reading and, again, justtoo many mistakes. Ambrose did not live up to his reputaion on this book. Early in the book I found myself re-reading Chas Watrey's book ""Washout"". Chuck has passed now, I believe, but I am sure he would be upset to have his book quoted in the manner it was."
1,Soon to be on Used Bookstore Shelves Near You,"I was disappointed with this work, given Stephen Ambrose's previous works. I thought it would be more like ""Band of Brothers"", but it was more of a biography of George McGovern. It is short on the B-24, the AAF, and long on McGovern's romantic life. It also had a shocking number of typos and inaccuracies. Ambroses works are generally good historical works. I do, however, read Stephen Ambrose's books (which are relatively light reads), between more substantial authors like Martin Gilbert, John Keegan, and Lawrence James. If you really want to read this work, wait for it in the used bookstore shelves in the next year or so. There will be plenty."
1,Horrible,"I feel mislead. Steve Ambrose may have ""done one"" for his friend George McGoven but in the act he lost a loyal reader. I will never again buy an Ambrose book simply because he is the author.This does not begin to do the subject justice. It's as though he threw it together from a few notes and a couple of phone interviews."
1,Awful!,"With Ambrose's reputation I expected great things from this book. It would seem difficult to fail to write an interesting book on the subject, especially with Ambrose's admiration for McGovern.Unfortunately, the book reads as if someone turned on a tape recorder and then transcribed with no editing. It is painful to read and terribly inconsistent. Given the volume Ambrose publishes, he has to cut corners somewhere, and this was unfortunately where he cut. I could not finish it."
1,Wild Blue????????????????,"If you like Ambrose's style, you may like this book. It is a rambling, loose collection of anecdotes and interview notes, that ultimately comes across flat and uninspired. The book seems like it was prepared and researched in a rushed manner. If you want a 'quickie' read that does not require much thinking, this is it. If you want anything close to a substantive history of the 15th AF or the B-24, look elsewhere."
2,disappointing,"I really wanted to enjoy this book. I just didn't live up to my expectations. Ambrose noted in the introduction that the book began as a biography of George McGovern and later turned into a story of ""the men and boys who flew the B-24s over Germany."" I got the impression he never did decide which book he was writing. That said, the book still has its good points. For one, it presented a side of McGovern that is not widely known. The reason I read this book was that I wanted to learn more about the air war in WWII, and I did learn a few things, though not as much as I had hoped. In following McGovern's war career, Ambrose takes you through the pilot training program and gives a good picture describes the difficulty of flying the B24 and what life was like on board the plane during a mission. Unfortunately, it was all interspersed with biographical information about the other members of the flight crew, ground crew, etc. that did more to confuse things than it added to the story."
4,Very interesting reading...and an easy read,"I believe some of the comments on this web site were a little too harsh regarding this book. I read lots of WWII history as a hobby and I was quite pleased with the book. It reads well and it's an easy read. Ambrose doesn't go into specific details about the campaign from Italy, but he does give you enough information to realize that these guys fighting from Italy did not have it as ""nice"" as the boys in England. Living in tents? Unbelieveable.The story is based more around the exploits of McGovern and his crew and a few other personnel flying from Cerignola, Italy. Ambrose tells us, and they tell us in their own words, about their frightening experiences flying against the Germans; their fear of flak; and their experiences in simply flying a B-24.The book may not be as specific as The Mighty Eighth by Roger Freeman, but it is, nevertheless, a very good read. I certainly recommend this book because it deals primarily with experiences in a B-24."
2,The Wild Blue,My objection to the book is not in Ambrose use of the scholarly work of another. My objection centers on the publisher's sloppy editing of this work.
2,"Ambrose should stick to history, not writing","At least it's not just me -- I was glad to see several other reviewers felt the same as I did. I read Band of Brothers after seeing the HBO mini-series, and was pleased to see that the characters were fleshed out in greater detail in the book. As I read it, I could not help notice what can only be characterised as mediocre writing. I was given Wild Blue as a Christmas gift, and am about to give up. The grammar and the bad prose are so annoying, I can not take it anymore. It's a shame -- the story and the people seem compelling, and the research seems to be there, but the writing would make my son's sixth grade teacher cringe. Several times I have thought to myself, ""How on earth did the editor let this manuscript go to print?"" As for the subject matter, it would be helpful to have included diagrams or cross sections, or a least demonstrative photos, of the B-24, to give the reader a better image of what the pilots and crew went through."
1,"Tedious, repetitive and sometimes ridiculous!","Not only do I feel cheated in that I unknowingly purchased a biography of George McGovern but this work by Mr. Ambrose reminds me of junior high history class. It is repetitive, mission after mission without anything worthwhile happening. It is also ridiculous as in the effort he makes to describe the harsh climate of 50 degrees below zero but then adds that the ground crews would hide their beer on a mission bound aircraft so that it would be cooled. If skin will freeze I can assure Mr. Ambrose that the crew's beer would certainly be frozen. This will be my final purchase of Mr. Ambrose's 'churned' efforts."
1,useless popular history,Ambrose should be ashamed of himself. The excellent author of Nixon and Eisenhower biographies now has edecided that he can get anything by the editors. This is a waste of time. It tries to show us the lives of the men who flew over Germany but ends up more of a memoir and more junky stories then actual history. Why not just publish a diary? he uncovers nothing new here and there are other books on the cubject by authors who actually studied the air war and didnt just 'feel' like writing a history because they are succesful.
2,Underwhelming,"Not on par with many of his past efforts. Book is mostly driven by Ambrose's adulation of former Presidential candidate George McGovern. Very little technical detail to rival other works such as ""D Day."" The continuity is poor and reads more like a flight log(the reviewer states from experence,as a former combat pilot.) He praises McGovern for his efforts as a B-24 pilot flying dangerous missions over very dangerous places. Ambrose, very cavalierly,excuses his protest of American men doing the same thing, with the same sense of duty, over the skies of Vietnam. He offers no explanation for this duplicity."
1,cant review it never showed up!!!,"I'm only giving this one star because amazon says I have to give something cause I dont feel they deserve even one star, I ordered this product May 4th, its now June 4th, and I still have not received my book. I have emailed the seller 3 times with no reply from them at all. This is my first bad experience on Amazon, but it wont stop me from buying off of Amazon again . Amazon is working with me to help me resolve the issue. I don't even really want my money back I would rather have my book, but only if its in the condition advertised----like new. I don't know whether to order from someone else as its part of a series or just keep waiting this out or what. But I will never buy from this person again."
1,Major Disappointment,"This book was short on the history of 15th Air Force and long on George McGovern's experience as a B24 pilot in Italy. George M. flew his first mission Nov. 11,1944 and completed the then required 35 missions. Not one word was written of the crews who flew their missions 1943 and early 1944 and had to fly 50."
3,Not the best,"The first half of the book was good, it told the story of where the flyers came from and I did find the personal stories very interesting. But the second half, the wartime stories are not well told, and I found myself skipping a chapter or two. This book is not Ambrose's best."
3,Not as good as Band of Brothers,"I enjoyed the history and real-life accounts of the flak (AA artillary) pilots and crews had to deal with, but felt a little flat when I was done. The some stories seemed abbreviated and simply mentioned as an afterthought. The ending seemed abrupt with some of the story not fully told."
2,Disappointed,"Not up to what I have come to expect from Ambrose. Similar to his last book on the transcontinental railroad. Hard to follow, not much depth. Seemed to be in a hurry to compete. Very short for such a dramatic subject. Best part was the prologue describing the B 24. This is not a book I would recommend. I had the good fortune 12 months ago to see the lone B 24 first hand in a flying display. It was an emotional sight. I also had the good fortune in the early 60s to work with a man who flew the B24 out of England."
1,History murdered in cold blood. Again.,"I am astounded that yet another book by Stephen Ambrose is trumpted about by the booksellers of America, when the Wall Street Journal and the Sacramento Bee both have exposed his ""history"" for what it is: The cold blooded murder of the history of the United States. Between slaughtering railroad history in the awful fashion he used in ""Nothing Like it in the World"", to the defamation of our soldiers in WWII, Mr. Ambrose leaves precious little print space for the other truly awful books that find their way to the shelves of our libraries and booksellers..."
1,Save your money unless you love Mc Govern,"This book is not about the men and boys who flew the B 24 it is a book about Mc Govern. Reading the book sort of makes you feel like he was the only man in the war. I purchased the book to read about all the men. The author could have even shown some about other men that did basicaly the same that became famous: Kennedy, Jimmy Stewert and others. He focused only on McGovern and I certinaly wonder how much he paid to get Stephen to write this book or is Stephen that much in love with Mc Govern. I can not stand the man now and will not ever knowingly buy another book of his.Mary Jo PottsThe Wild Blue : The Men and Boys Who Flew the B-24s Over Germany 1944-45"
2,I don't understand it,"How can this book be called : ""The Men and Boys Who Flew the B-24s Over Germany 1944-45"", if it's based mainly in a crew flying over ITALY?!!"
1,completely boring and political,This is a terrible book. I did not know when I bought it with my hard earned American money that it would be almost all about former Senator McGovern. I did not spend my money to buy praise for McGovern whom I cannot stomach in any way!The book actually is a major bore and I am sick and tired about hearing about the raid on Polesti which has been over anlyzed and over analyzed some more. Not one thing in the book is new or exciting. I fell asleep reading it since it is great for sending you into dream land. Save your money unless you love McGovern.
3,"Highly readable and entertaining, but controversial","The Wild Blue: The Men and Boys Who Flew the B-24s Over Germany by Stephen E. Ambrose is controversial because some scholars point out Ambrose has lifted the work of other authors without placing said work inside ""quotation"" marks. That is a tragic error. Is it an error of omission or commission? I do not know. I do know it is ethically wrong. The book tells the story of former US Presidential candidate and US Senator George McGovern. It tells of McGovern's upbringing, his journey to college, the outbreak of World War II, his falling in love and marriage, his joining the US Army Air Corps, his training as a pilot, and his combat deployment and action where he was based out of Italy bombing the Axis war machine. It is written in Ambrose's wonderful narrative style. It is highly readable and entertaining. Read in January 2005."
4,Not quite his best but still a good read for Ambrose fans,"I just recived this book four days ago and finished it two days ago I just simply could not put it down. As far as attracting the reader and holding him/her in Ambrose pulls another rabbit out of his hat, as the book is interesting and has much good information. However some things could be fleshed out a little more and it did seem unusally choppy and rushed for a work by Ambrose. I also would have liked to have seen a bit more about other B-24 crews as well. Still every good American should read this book so as not to forget what McGovern and all of the other young men, many of whom gave their lives accomplished, the downfall of Nazi Germany. We owe the Individuals whom fought that terrible war a debt which can never be repaid."
3,Black N' Blue,"Quick, easy read gives a vivid picture of what it must have been like flying these cumbersome beasts. I enjoyed the book for what it is...an extension of interviews with the B-24 crews. It's a bit heavy on the McGovernism. Unpardonable, really, not to include a schematic or diagram of the plane itself. Overall, a great portrait of how miserable WWII was for the combatants."
1,Just awful...,"Anyone who is interested in air warfare should avoid this book. It's clearly just thrown together to take advantage of Ambrose's popularity, and is not any where close to serious. In Colorado Springs last week Ambrose refered to the B-24 as ""stubby winged"" -- in fact, the B-24 had a very long wing (though slender). It seemed Ambrose had never even looked closely at a picture. For a good review of another of Amobrose's books, check the Atlantic Monthly about June 2001."
2,Dud,"This is a PR piece for McGovern. Had to force myself to read it. Then I find out some of the writing was plagerized, I really wish I hadn't."
2,poorly written and proofread,"I was not an english major but the number of fragmented sentences is unbelieveable.Also when McGovern leaves college in South Dakota for the airforce, it is written that the college president and a large number of the student went to Milwaukee to see him off on a train to Minneapolis.Anyone with any sense of geography would understand you do not go from North or South Dakota through Milwaukee to get to Minneapolis.It is also a long way for the student body to travel to say goodby. Did he get Milwaukee mixed up with Sioux Falls,Fargo or Bismark?"
3,Looking for more,"This book is a good contribution to the Second World War and the history of the B-24, but it does not fill sufficiently support the thesis the way Ambrose has with previous books he has written. I would say it is well researched, but it is common knowledge that Ambrose plagiarized this work. Despite this flaw, I believe the book has educational benefits and is worth reading but not as a stand alone on Liberators or the 8th Air Force."
2,The George McGovern Story,"I will start out by saying that I've always despised George McGovern and his liberal politics but in all honesty I have a new respect for Mr. McGovern, I still don't like his politics, but as a man he obviously had many admirable traits.As to the book itself, the correct title should have been ""Flying with George McGovern and a few other guys"". Stephen Ambrose is a better author than this book would lead you to believe. I've read several of his other works so I mistakenly assumed that this book would be of similar caliber but it wasn't even close.If you want to learn more about George McGovern this would be a useful book. If, on the other hand, you want to learn about the B-24's part in WWII, skip it."
3,"Good, but not Ambrose's best work.","After having read Band of Brothers, I came to expect more action from Ambrose's accounts of WWII. I find that he spends too much time on the training aspect of these AAF men, which proves to be much drier than the telling of the E Company's training in Band of Brothers. I think that Mr. Ambrose should have told more about the actual battles that these planes flew through than the selection and training of these brave men."
5,Highly Recommended,"Excellent book, giving new insight in this piece of history.A lot of research went into this book and it shows.The story is well told with many anecdotes and is a joy to read."
5,Outstanding description of air combat,Appreciated the description of the feelings of the pulpits and crews. Ambrose is a historian with sensitivity which he is able to put into the written word and the reader can feel.
2,The Wild Blue,"If this is the first Ambrose book one would read. He or she may not want to read any of his others. It does not have the style and substance of his previous books. Too much fluff in the begining and too concentrated on one bomber crew. Poor sentence structure and jumbled story line confuse the reader. Some early chapters read like his rough notes were copied verbatim. It is still an intriguing story of the extreme dangers, fears and hardships the young men of our bomber crews had to endure.If the facts of the story are true, and I believe they are, I gained a new respect for George McGovern and all the other men of the Bomber Command. Stephen Ambrose is a great chronicler of World War II. I have read them all and look forward to his next book."
3,"A great story, but the book is tepid","I do not in any way want to diminish the actual bravery or skill of the personnel depicted in this book. But, as a book, this was disappointing. Ambrose's other WWII books are generally better, as books about WWII. If you want a serious look at the bomber war, go elsewhere. Finally, if you want a ""popular"" work on the ""feel"" of the bomber war, the video/DVD ""Memphis Belle"" (despite some Hollywoodization) is more moving. And, if you just want to read something good by Ambrose, try ""Undaunted Courage"" or his book on D-Day.Summary: This is OK, but reads like a series of longish magazine articles stitched together. So -- the 3-star rating is ""average"" for an average book. For young teens interested in WWII, I would rate this higher; it is a good, quick read; my 11-year-old loved it."
3,interesting but not scholarly assessment of the air war,"Dr. Ambrose's latest work is somewhat mistitled in that it, for the most part, focuses on the exploits of one B-24 crew, George McGovern's. Previous reviews have been, I feel, rather harsh for the book is readable and gives some fine insights. I suggest the book be read in conjunction with 2 excellent assessments of the air war: Michael Sherry's THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIRPOWER (cited in Ambrose's book) and a most recent addition, Robin Neillands's THE BOMBER WAR. Both of these volumes discuss, in a most scholarly fashion, the nature, strategy and even morality of the USAAF and RAF air war against Nazi Germany. When analyzed with THE WILD BLUE, these books present the reader with an overview of the air war that not only is enlightening in military terms but humanizes the war so as to make a lasting impression."
1,What a rip-off!,"Poorly written, badly researched and hastily patched-up work. It seemed the book was written to capitalize more on Ambrose's reputation...because he did write some good books before. Maybe he wanted to write a new book to pay for a new kitchen sink. With this book, it just sealed his reputation (as far as I'm concerned) as a light-weight historian. One is best left to stick with the likes of more substantive historians like D. McCullough, R. Massie, J. Keegan, or M. Gilbert. Wasted my money on this one, and I'll sell quick as lightning, soon as I can find another sucker. (Should have no problem; there's one born every minute.)"
2,Pop WW 2 for people who do not study WW2,"Superficial account of WW2 in the air. Not up to Ambrose's usual standards.Try Steve Birdsall's ""Log of the Liberators"" (1973) if you want to read the real stuff. I guess Steve Ambrose should stay on the ground."
4,Good book; slightly misleading title,"A lot of the previous reviewers have been entirely too critical of the book simply because it does not address all B-24 crews and just focuses on one. Still a good book, and an excellent example of leadership. If you're interested in a good book about ONE (yes, I realize only ONE) B-24 crew, and can get past the fact that it is only about ONE crew (did I emphasize it enough?) this is still going to be an enjoyable read."
2,"Ok, not the best","The book is more about George McGovern not the boys/men that flew. It is more about his life written from more of a subjective point of view rather than facts. It was ok, not totally boring and interesting at times but I have read far better WWII books."
3,A McGovern Memoir in Disguise,"""The Wild Blue"" follows George McGovern's short career in the Army Air Force, highlighting his training and combat experience as a B-24 pilot in WWII. While McGovern is a noble character, and his sacrifices and those of his peers are tragic, the book fails in its attempt to be a broader history. Very few other characters are drawn in detail, numbers of missions and bombs dropped seem to be added as afterthoughts, and the losses of U.S. servicemen are treated antiseptically and without passion. The kernal of a definitive work is there, but the effort to follow through was not."
3,Not so bad.,I can't corraborate all the preceding negative reviews.I found the book interesting and easy to read. Certainly feel it wasn't a waste of time or money.
1,So very boring,"Ambrose seems to have taken up right where he left off in ""Nothing like it in the World"" slow and boring, considering the topic that's no small trick either. But if you have an interest in the living arrangements made by Mrs. McGovern through the war by all means pick this book up that and numerous other mundane tidbits are covered in great detail here."
2,Seems like I've read this before . . .,Would be a good book if he hadn't lifted passages and ideas from WINGS OF MORNING by Thomas Childers . . . Why Stephen?! WHY?!!
2,Disappointed,"I've read several of Ambrose's other books and generally enjoyed them, but this one was a disappointment. His descriptions of the psychological stresses on the crews were a strong point. Unfortunately, the book is so full of errors in aviation related areas that anyone with an aviation background and some knowledge of WW2 airwar history will be immediately aware that Ambrose knew very little about airplanes or the airwar in Europe. It seems he tried to make up for this by overloading the book with general platitudes, many of which sounded like something we might see in a war era Hollywood movie. The errors were a major distraction for me and I would have a hard time recommending this book to anyone other then a novice with little or no history/aviation background."
1,Careless and thrown together,"This book was thrown together and it shows. It is amazing that the air war over Germany can be recounted with so little passion, tension or insight. This is a poor excuse for a book and an insult to the men won fought in the skies over Germany. One example: because George McGovern's plane never had to fight attacking fighters, there is nothing in the book about it. This despite the fact that he contends the book is not just about McGovern and his crew but the whole B-24 effort over Germany. Don't waste your money."
4,An interesting read about the B-24,"This was a very interseting book although not one of Mr. Ambose's best. I learned a lot about the plane, the men who flew them, the training which was extensive, the dangers these men faced & how they contributed to the war. I'm a slow reader, but read this in a day. I would recommend this to anyone and it was certainly worth the price of the book."
5,"Enjoyable, and extremely informative.","While the book was guility of cheerleading, it sure showed that the men who flew the B-24 certainly deserved to be cheered more than they have. The book was very compelling, and enjoyable in audio form. It lacked the details of a true history, and was more than lacking in real military details, but it was a book about the personnel experiences and feel of an under reported group of extremely brave men. I was amazed by the bravely and the hardships these men faced, and shocked that despite his many other faults that anyone would question McGovern's service to his country."
3,Ridiculously expensive,Is the book about the best covering occult stuff of that period of history? Yes (5 stars)Is 40 dollars for this paper back book a fair price? No (1 star)
5,Overview,"This DVD is very educational, and although controversal, makes you wonder if this possibly happened."
3,Small problem,"There are two orange single track pieces the don't fit together right. They should be just a hair longer.Other than that everything works the way it should and my son has alot of fun with it.I will be buying the crash curve set as well, but not here.Also the prices here are way too high. I bought mine at Meijer for $8.99Don't let this product stray you from Amazon, this is the first time I found a product cheaper elsewhere."
4,"8CR13MoV, not AUS6A.... but decent knife.","Just a little heads up, this knife is the Chinese 8CR13MoV version, not the Japanese AUS6A version as described. There are two versions of this selling here on Amazon, it appears you will get the new Chinese (not better) version, no matter which you order. I was going to return the Knife immediately upon seeing this, but decided to open the sealed packaging and check it out. The Knife was ""decently"" sharp from the factory, and the blade locks up nice, with no perceptible wiggles. A handful of passes on a fine stone, and it's hair shaving sharp. For the $10-$12 this usually runs, it's a nice little pocket knife. Not sure how the edge will hold up, but for light duty cutting, I think it'll be fine."
4,Good quality,"One of the better items that is built in china,quality of workmanship is good and made as good as the ones made in the usa."
4,Into 80's Metal.....,"I've finally received my copy of this cd yesterday and I can't get enough of it! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because the vocals need to grow on me. But musically this album ROCKS! If you're into 80's metal or the first two Galactic Cowboys albums, Sacred Warrior and Stryper then you'll love this Cd! I don't quite hear the Geoff Tate vocals on the album as one review I've read has said, not unless you're comparing it to the self-titled Queensryche album and their second one ""the Warning""; but I do hear the Iron Madien and Helloween influences though.This is a must have for every metal head especially for the 7th track ""Black Witch""! It reminds me of the song ""Whitewashed Tomb"" from Tourniquets first album ""Stop the Bleeding"". Of course everything they've done is great though.Anyway, if you love great hard drivin, rhythmic crunching metal this Cd is for YOU!"
4,Great metal with progressive touches,"Jacob's Dream was a bit of a surprise to me. They're musicianship is excellent and their delivery is superb. For a debut, this is great work. The vocalist sounds like he's trying too hard, but otherwise he does his job admirably. He is obviously emulating the style of Bruce Dickinson (Iron Maiden) as well as Geoff Tate (Queensryche). The guitarwork is rips along nicely but many of the keyboard flourishes seem to be afterthoughts. All in all, this is a great album and I suspect that this band has a bright future. They aren't completely original or anything, but they mix good heavy metal with a pinch of progressive rock and deliver it with genuine intensity and power. The progressive touches are just that...touches. Like I said, this album doesn't push the boundaries of metal, but it takes the tried and true formula and does it very well."
4,Majesty Of Power Metal!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"OK, to whoever said they were a Xian group, bite me you balloon headed geek. I'm sure Brian Slagel would NEVER sign some bible-thumping holy rollers. Anyway, this is quite majestic prog-power metal, and predictably, it soars like an eagle.The lyrics are very cerebral, touching on many diverse topics. The guitars are complex, almost reminiscent of later Iron Maiden. Despite what some people say here, the production is actually pretty good. The only thing I could complain about is that the songs could be longer and that the singer is not exactly the most original(although still enjoyable). I anticipate what this band shall offer in the future.I would recommend this to fans of Fates Warning and later Iron Maiden."
4,Maiden Meets Hammerfall.....Impressive,"I like these guys, I didn't at first, but this CD grew on me pretty quickly. I think they have a great future. They sound very much like Hammerfall. Not a bad thing.....Hammerfall is a very enjoyable listen in my opinion.I'm a Maiden fanatic, and Jacobs Dream brought back some old memories....Don't underestimate this band, they have all the potential they need. They just need to separate themselves from the others....I expect Jacobs Dream to move on to the next level with their next release.If you're a fan of Maiden, Hammerfall, Fates, or Queensryche...you should have very little trouble enjoying this.It's a 4 1/2....But for a debut, that's pretty impressive....."
5,One of the Best.,"One of the best ghost books, with respect to WV that I have read. The ideas are organized; the book is easy to read. Highly recomended."
2,Ratchet tie down.,"These are light duty tie downs, which do not meet the requirements for my application. Spend a little extra on some better tie downs."
5,TrainMaster,"I saw the video with my grandchildren and loved it. Purr-fect for children, any age.It's a good old-fashion story with a ""superhero grandpa."" I'd liketo seem more adventures with grandpa as the star and hero, neat idea.My grandchildren are the right age for this kind of wholesome fun:cheer the hero and booo the villian.Train Master"
2,Don't Waste Your Money!,"Only one good story here. ""Beggarman, Thief"" by Mary Janice Davidson is excellent. Unfortunately, the other two storiesare just REALLY bad.I found ""Stranded"" offensive,not erotic.""Light on Her Toes"" is just plain silly. Who wants to read a romance where you have to keep flipping to the glossary every other sentence just to understand it?"
1,Disappointing!,"I found this book to be such a disappointment. Angela Knight is one of my fav so I was really looking forward to her story. But this was such a bland, boring book. I don't recommend it at all."
2,UNFINISHED!!!,"I am undaunted by the rest of the positive reviews. Did no one notice that the last and longest story by Camille Anthony was left unfinished? Who wants to read a short story that requires you to read another book to prepare you for the events in the story, a dictionary to understand it and another book to find out what happens. Not to mention that these are all repeats and can be found in ebooks. I'd like to know before I spend more than $10 whether the stories are fresh or not and whether they are complete in themselves. The first two stories were enjoyable enough but so short that I would never have purchased this book if I had known about the last one. Do yourself a favor and save enough for a nice lunch and borrow this from someone stupid enough to buy it. Come to think of it you can have mine!!!"
2,Romancing the edge: In other Worlds,This was three short stories that I didn't enjoy. I finished reading the book only because I had paid for it. The story by Angela Knight was ok.
3,disappointed,"Two of my favorite authors and I felt short changed. the stories seemed rushed and way to short. I will buy anything with Maryjanice Davidson and Angela Knight as the authors, but I will rethink buying this type of book again. the stories just don't seem worth the money and I don't always like the remaining authors stories that are lumped into the book with them. Once in a while I get lucky and find a new author I like but since books are getting more expensive and my wallet smaller I will have to start giving this type of book a pass."
5,A great knife: easy to maintain and convenient to carry,"W.R. Case makes some of the very finest pocket knives currently available, and this model is an excellent example of the high quality of their products. The blade is sharp, holds an edge extremely well, and is easy to care for, since it's made of stainless surgical steel. The knife is easy to use, since it includes a lockback mechanism that holds it open firmly and safely during use. It's convenient to carry because of its extremely slim profile. It also includes a lanyard hole which makes it possible to carry the knife on a key chain, if one wishes. This is a great knife that owners will cherish for many years."
5,Favorite knife,"My husband is a Facilities Manager for a hotel and needs to be ready for just about anything at any time. He always carries a small knife and loved this specific knife and carried this knife because, once sharpened, he could use it for just about anything. He cut carpet, stripped wires, got rid of shaggy strings and on and on. Then, he lost it. He couldn't find another like it. On his last birthday our son and wife gave him a gift certificate to Amazon.com. He was looking at knives and there was his favorite knife. It is not an expensive knife so he got two. He is now a happy guy and carries his knife all the time."
4,Nice little pocket knife.,"I just got this knife today. So far I really like it. I enjoy its the minimalist and understated styling. And it comes with a very sharp edge. Nothing much more to say. Two reasons I did not give it 5 stars.1: The edge that is available to take the blade out is a little small. I'd imagine that someone with large fingers might have a little problem doing so.2: Depressing the lock to get the blade back in is a little hard, I think it might loosen up a little with use.Otherwise, I'm very happy with the knife."
1,Poor excuse,"For that amount of money, I thought I would get a nice knife. It is so small it may get lost if I put it on the kitchen table. What a waste of my hard earned cash.Wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
3,This...... From a Techno DJ??,"i bought this CD on the strength of these online reviews, and i regret it wholeheartedly. it says that jeff mills is a detroit techno DJ, but this compilation is neither techno, nor is it a continuous mix!!!! i guess if your into artsy fartsy pretentious music, this one is definitely for you. ...."
3,"Okay, not great","I'm considering travel to this area. This film is a father/daughter trip to several areas in Peru. It's a bit heavy with local festivals etc., but not all bad. The crowds in the background at some of the more popular places like Machu Pichu continue to surprise me!"
2,Home Movie,"Sorry, this comes across like someones home movie. The saving factor is that it does show bits and pieces that the ""bigger budget"" movies skip over."
2,Mystery Science Theater fodder,"My first thought as I began watching this was: MST3K--this film is unintentionally funny. Our whole family laughed ourselves hoarse, especially any time anyone opened his or her mouth. We enjoyed the redheaded girl especially. The only annoyance was that at the end of the movie, it abruptly turned into a Chick tract--well, annoying for me, anyway. I was watching what I supposed was a horror film, albeit a ridiculous one, and got blindsided by a turn or burn sermon, and I found that a bit deceitful. But then, I got annoyed when Stargate transformed mid-movie from what I supposed was an intelligent sci-fi film into a glorified Star Wars rip-off. At least anyone reading this review won't get blindsided.It gets two stars for me, but that's only for the humor value. Watch it if you want to laugh, but don't expect much else."
4,Understandingly Good,"Were we watching the same movie? This had a lot of positve hype among the Festies so I thought I would give it a shot. Boy, was I happy I did. If nothing else a good reatal, although it is in my lib. It is really a worth a look type of Indy that I found interesting."
3,"Its better than ""Scream""..","But then again, so are many horror films. This ""Jacob's Ladder"" on a budget is'nt as bad as some of the reviewers think. Blair Witch is 10 times worse than this."
5,Gearheads Young And Young At Heart,"If you have a super stock rod...or just a rice burner you have to admit this is one of the best collections of car songs there is. Great road music to get your motor reved up and burn a little rubber of your own...even if it just on your stereo !!!Don't be a "" Chicken ""...take a ride down..."" Thunder Road ""..."
2,Window marred,"I just purchased this watch to use, for when I am working and not trying to be all neat and dressed up like. I wasn't even doing anything worth mentioning and realised I just marred up the window for my new watch. i didn't wear it more then a few days and I have this discoloration when I check the time. I am soo upset, this shouldn't happen with mineral type windows. My watch might have been a fluke, but I am annoyed by it, and I am faced with wearing my nice watch insetad. The light button on the face, and the nice display is great, but it's unsightly to look at in my eyes. I won't put it on myu wrist with a huge mar on it, too thick to be a sratch. Looks like someone scraped it on gravel. Not sure how it happened, hopefully I am the only one this happens to."
5,Nothing but Casio,My other Casio watch finally quit working and was starting to look worn so I used the excuse of a bad battery to buy a new one. I'm a big fan of the value and style. My faverite feture of this watch is the light button on the front and it also has a feature that turns the light on automatically when you flip your writ up - how cool. You can't go wrong with this watch... Joe
4,pacer function not up to my expectation but still useful.,"I bought this sport watch hoping that it can be used as the cadence counter for my mtb. But I found that the pace function starts from the range 100 ~200 paces which are too fast for the cycling.But I can still use the 150 paces for my biking instead of the 75 cadences. For 100 cadences I can use the 200 paces/minute. They are just the same.The beeps are not too noisy that will irritate the user.Therefore, this watch is still not a bad buy after all.In fact, it is even better than the cadence counter of the biking computer. As cadence counter does not tell you how many peddles/minute; but this gadget will sound exactly at each interval that I can follow to make my biking experience more rewarding. I feel less breathless now while using the watch. It seems my stamina improve somewhat.Not forget to mention that the watch arrived Malaysia in just 6 days.Good service, Amazon.Will come back to you if I need other stuffs.Thank you! Amazon!"
2,One Year Later,"I have had this watch for exactly one year now. The battery just died, which means it lasted 1/10th of the advertised life. The face has a few scratches, seems to be a very soft plastic, scratches show up white. Not worth replacing the battery when it is in this shape. I think I was pretty careful with this one, I do not do physical labor or anything. My last watch, a Fossil, lasted me over ten years, I think three batteries in that time. You get what you pay for."
3,Goody goody,"Good one.All the features specified are good enough to make it a good watch.Should consider this , if thinking of this price range."
3,"Large (good and bad), Would not buy again","Pros:- Price- Features- Large display / large digits- clear digits and very visible- long battery lifeCons:- Much larger and thicker than I expected it to be- Buttons on the watch accidentaly gest pushed a few times a day- No backlite (old fashioned light bulb on side surface of the watch)- No standard menus between Casio watchesI have been using this watch for over a month now. I do love the large vivid clear display. But that comes with larger than expected watch. the real_estate on this watch wasn't used very well. I ended up getting a new battery for my old CASIO watch and using that as my main watch and this new watch is backup watch now. If I had to do it again, i would get a different CASIO."
4,Colossians,This is the best book I have ever read on the book of Colossians. The writer has a deep insight on the Christ set forth in this book. He explains very clearly the absolute deity of Jesus Christ as the sole expression of God to us in this age.Wimbly J Hankins
5,One of my favorite Kim Robertson CD's,I love this CD. It is certainly one of Kim's best. I have used several of the tracks in creating photo montages. The music is so mellow and fits the mood of what I was trying to convey with my photos.
5,"""I Really Enjoyed This Book""","I'm a fan of ""christian fiction"" because of Victoria Christopher Murray. She along with fellow writers Jacquelin Thomas, ReShonda Tate Billingsley and Kimberla Lawson Roby, show that you don't need foul language, raunchy sex, and violence for a novel to be good."
4,Highly recommended,"I enjoyed reading this book, but sometimes I thought the characters were too good to be true. I realize it is a work of fiction, but it does serve as a model of how we need to confront problems as Christians. I appreciated all the scriptural references they used to support what they were doing. I even liked the female pastor dynamic that was present. I liked Temptation better than Joy, but would recommend them both."
4,Wonderful Scripture,"The story flows and keeps your attention. Perhaps a little overboard with scripture but wonderful reference for the reader when trials and tribulations seem to consume your every breath. A good base for married couples struggling through this journey of daily 'Temptation's. I appreciate the realistic foundation and context this story was written in. There is wonderful exposure and magnificaion of God's words of unmatched beauty and truth.Much Respect,JMRC 'BOLD' Reviewer: Linda Washington-Johnson"
5,great book,This book opened my eyes to how we can get so disconnected and how things don't always turn out in our favor.
4,good BOOK,"WELL I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I ENJOYED THIS BOOK. THIS WAS THE FIRST BOOK I READ WITHOUT ANY PROFANITY AND SEX IN A LONG TIME AND I LOVED IT,I JUST DONT THINK I COULD OF DEALT WITH IT THE WAY KYLA DID, I WOULD OF HAD TO KICK JASMINES BEHIND.I GAVE THIS BOOK FOUR STARS BECAUSE IT LEFT SO MUCH OUT TO ME,BUT HEY THATS MY OPINION. BUT ITS WAS A GREAT BOOK TO READ."
4,Good start,"3.5 stars. I can see why this was a break out novel for Ms. Murray. I think we can all agree that Jasmine Larson steals the show. however, I do think the book was a bit slow in getting started and that the drama could have been amped up a bit more. I like the message that a family who prays together stays together. I also think the Brian and Alexis thing went way too fast and it seemed like a proposal stemmed because they were just anxious to 'do the do'. Regardless, this is a strong, entertaining read."
2,Not As Good As The Reviews Say,"I was expecting something so different. I guess the old saying is true that you can't take the words of others. You have to judge it for yourself. I didn't think this was any different than any other love story with a happy ending. If you want to read a really different love story with a christian flavor, read Promises Beyond Jordan. It's a good love story and a quick read."
5,Very good book,This is a very good book. I read another book by the author & thought the story was slow & not really what I expected but overall it was an enjoyable read. This book is the complete opposite. Definitely a page turner.
4,Great book!!!,"The story was believable and the characters were well developed. I enjoyed it even more because, even though it was a Christian book, full of Christian themes, it was missing the usual offensive and obnoxious overtone of entitlement that all too often comes with books of this genera."
5,Fabulous and emotional. A must-read.,"This story rocked! It pulled me into the drama from page one. Even though I have plenty of other books to read I kept wanting to read this one. The characterization is fabulous and the emotion is deep. The marital stuff is very well done and the temptation is believable. I particularly enjoyed the spiritual element of this novel. It was very detailed and comprehensive, yet it perfectly fit the story without feeling like a sermon. Probably because the main characters were all Christians. There were some POV issues, but the realistic and emotional depth in this story made up for the small stuff. Highly recommended."
5,One of the best debut novels ever,"I do not exxaggerate. Victoria Murray's writing in ""Temptation"" deserves every single accolade and then some. I am so happy that she wrote this book; a book with a story that needed to be told. Her goal was to write a page turning book and she did just that. Keep them coming, Ms. Murray."
3,Good Christian fiction,"If your a believer and you enjoy fiction by african-american authors...but you can't handle books such as Eric Jerome, E.Lynn you will enjoy this book. My bookclub which is more secular enjoyed the book and the storyline...but at times we became distracted with all of the Bible verses. At times the characters were not realistic...and overall the author wrapped it up too neatly ""happily ever after"" ending. I felt she spent too much time on irrelvent information rather than developing and finishing up each persons story. I would read her next novel just to see if she has improved...if you enjoy her work check out the secular story...by Kimberla Lawson Roby ""Casting The First Stone""."
4,Great Read,"This book was a great read. I thought I knew how the story would end, but I was pleasantly surpirsed. I enjoy reading this author and look forward to more to come from her."
5,A wonderful reading experience for all Christians!,I Loved reading Temptation. The bible references were wonderful and the storyline really kept my attention. I finished it in 2 days and hope my husband as well as all couples will read it.
4,Inspiring,"This book was wonderful! Never before have I read a book that was so inspiring. I loved the characters devotion to God and family, and that is what we are lacking in today's society! It just reminds me that with GOD, all things are possible. I especially loved the various scriptures the author used throughout the book! They fit right in with the everyday trials that we must go through! All I can say is that it was simply marvelous!"
5,Excellent and well written,"The storyline in this book is exceptional. The characters were alive and well spoken. Christian fellowship is alive and on the move. The relationship that the characters had with one another was real to the chore. Situations good or bad are out there whether you are a christian or not, but being under God's anoited veil is the answer to them. Mrs. Murray, please keep up the writing and I can't wait for the next novel. You have found a faithful reader and I will be looking out for you. Some people feel that waiting on God is painful and frustrating. However, when your season comes to be blessed, it's more than one can comprehend and receive. God is awesome. Can you stand to be blessed?"
5,Don't Get confused,"I don't quite understand the Jury is in comment. This is supposed to be about this book, not another. Anyway, this is a great book. It is well written and the characters are engaging. I have shared this book with several of my friends and intend to buy a copy for my mother. EVERYONE LOVES IT!!! Read it for yourself. Of course, there will always be some that won't like it, but overwhelmingly, most will thoroughly enjoy it."
3,Good over all but...,"Spirtually minded readers will enjoy the catharisis of living in the lives of Kyla and Jefferson Blake. The story is real and you can feel the love of the characters for each other. However, Murray's development of the relationship between Alexis and Brian is weak! Perhaps Murray should focus on one relationship in her next effort and colorize the cast of characters that influence the protagonists. We can only invest in one couple per book when that level of drama is being presented."
5,Wonderful display of what GOD can do!,"Awesome book! Words can't decribe the joy I felt while reading this book. Initially I picked it up because I wanted to read this ""Christian Fiction"" novel, (as it was labled) and I am glad that I did. It is about time that someone wrote about relationships and the Christian walk. I loved the main characters Kayla and Jefferson; however I enjoyed the single and saved character Alexis unfold as she trusted in God and stuck to her convictions and beliefs when it came to her love life. And I especially enjoyed the themes of salvation and deliverance! I urge all to read this book and pass it on!"
5,We Are All Tempted!!!!,"Journey with a couple who refused to let the evils of temptation destroy their love and marriage. And do they struggle for better... This is a novel that grabs you and keeps your attention. Christian fiction at it's best. A must read. Christian fiction will never be the same. Deception, betrayal, lust, anger...Refreshing. My spirit was lifted. I will buy her next novel without reading a review."
4,WS12A,I have all x10 products in my home. They feel cheap and can be a little trouble setting up but once you get them working it is amazing. I use Harmony 1100 to control them. I have had only one switch fail after a few months. I have been using them for over a year. I just purchased more today. The price of them is so much better than their competition!!!!!!!!!
3,A simple game my son loves,"This is a real good deal, compared to the prices that people normally pay where I live, in Europe (about 25-40$ for a single cd-rom). All you do is race cars around, dodging obstacles etc., but it is a nice time-passer and interactive so a little better than TV. OK, it is mindless and there's nothing to learn, but there is a place for that!Recommended, if you know what you are getting."
5,Great book!,I found the book to be a great read. But then again I was there during the same time frame so I am biased! The letters home tended to be a bit tedious but that was the format.
2,How it was or how he wanted to remember it??,"I'm sorry, I was a Marine Scout/Sniper and all this book seemed to me was a fiction story. The Hathcock book was filled with facts and recorded history. I felt that this was a case of the ""water boy"" who remembers that he was the ""star quarterback""."
3,"Good, But Not the Best","I enjoyed reading this book -- it is a quick, easy page turner. However, I recently read Henderson's book about Carlos Hathcock and came away with a few comparative impressions. First, Henderson's book seems more credible. Second, Henderson's book focuses more on the actual engagement / kills by Hathcock, whereas this book spends more time on Joe's general experiences as a Marine in training and then in Vietnam. Both men, however, are certainly heroes, in my opinion.If you want an easy read, this is the book for you, but if you want a better idea of what being a sniper during the Vietnam era was really all about, I recommend Henderson's book Marine Sniper: 93 Confirmed Kills."
3,"Dear Mom,A Sniper's Vietnam- Very Tame, almost boring","Very little sniper activity, I almost stopped reading it. Lots about daily activities,items such as that , but not that interesting, at least,not to me..'Nuff Said..."
5,Great book!,"This book really puts you on the front lines. The author augments his activities ""in country"" with correspondence home to meld a truly riveting account of a Vietnam Marine Sniper's world.I have enjoyed this more than any book that I have read on Vietnam to date.Highly recommended!~"
4,Totally Recommended,"It's been a while since I read this book, but I can say that it's totally worth it. I believe this is actually the first and only book I've read dealing with the Vietnam War. Can't imagine what it must have been like. A very good book."
4,"""A Good read""","Author talks about his personal experience, going from Marine recruiting and boot camp in the U.S., through his tour of duty in Vietnam as a sniper. At times, I laughed from the author's humor; at other times, I grew teary-eyed from the hell these guys have to go through in war. You can see the author's transformation from boy at the beginning of the book to seasoned veteran in the end. I recommend this book!"
3,"This is a good read... even for a ""civilian"".","I enjoyed this book, for several reasons. I liked that the author writes quite a bit about his time at Boot Camp and Sniper School. When in Vietnam he writes about his tour,of course, but also such things as when exactly it was when he realized that we (the U.S.) were in trouble in the conflict... Yet - he still has most of his tour remaining and has to perform well. And Does."
3,"the book is certianly a fun read, but credible?","i served as a forward controller in the arizona with the 1st marines (aug-nov '70, hill 52, 270,charlie ridge, happy valley, etc.)mr ward's descriptions of the area are true to life. I think j.t. ward was a fine marine and a good sniper. he did a good job on the book,could have used a better editor, though. i just think attention to detail and credibility were not given much priority."
3,Partly Truth Partly Fiction,Good read but as with just about all personal accounts of the Vietnam War it has to be taken with a grain of salt. One man's truth is another man's fiction. As the years roll by and the memories grow dimmer we all tend to substitute fiction in place of facts that we can not totally recall....
5,Great book,"In 1993 J.T. Ward came to my high scool class and spoke with us about his life in Vietnam. I know it was hard for him to speak to a room full of kids about something so many others are still blocking from their minds. I think that this book is incredible, I have read it a hand full of times, even had to save it from three feet of water when mom's basement flooded. I am sorry that people have to get upset over facts - that war was an inconceivable experience for the men and women who gave their time/lives there. I know this war is hard for people to relive to this day, and any account, is welcome to me. I have the nothing but respect for veterans of foreign wars."
3,War stories are always interesting,"But this one is less well written than most. Certain sections seemed less than credible. However, there are a few things sprinkled in that are unforgettable. A good book to take with you on a trip to that part of the world, but there are better alternatives."
1,This account of the 5th Marines is not at all accurate.,Joe Ward claims one shot kills at 1500 yards. This never happened in Vietnam. He didn't carry a .45 pistol because it lacked stopping power. That is absurd. He served in Whiskey company. There is no Whiskey company. He saw an F-4 Phantom fly thru a tree. Impossible without crashing. The entire story is amateurish and full of errors.
5,You can easily read this whole book in one sitting.,A must for anyone interested in Vietnam ground operations. Written in a descriptive heartfelt style with a total lack of Ramboisms. A great read.
5,great realistic look at vietnam,"He was not bragging, it was a real marine's story. I liked the fact that he did not mention how many confirmed kills he had, just his experinces, and how the letters from his mom kept him going. I am waiting for the sequel."
2,"Inaccurate informationally, full of ""sea stories"".","As a military sniper, I was amazed that the author would attempt the extreme descriptions of impossible shots (head shots on running targets at 800 meters, engagements at 1500 meters and beyond), but as I read further it became obvious that this work is an ex- (oops, I mean former) Marine's opportunity to cash in on the current popularity of VietNam/sniper title paperbacks. From the reviews I've read here, no one seems to be the wiser. Ignorance is bliss ..."
5,From the heart!,"Few books have moved me as this one. I learned not only about the war, but human nature. I found the writing to be of extraordinary quality and the messages profound. Yes, it's about the Marine Corps and snipers in Vietnam, but it's also a fantastic novel about the human condition. A MUST READ!"
5,Thanks for some new music,"I get tired of waiting for most classic metal bands to release a new album. Most of them just put out new compilation albums to get your money. Some, put out new records, and they try to sound like Pantera or some new band (Alice Cooper!?). Others, go straight to sellout pop(Aerosmith). Only a handful of classic bands have recently given us some new music in the classic style we love. Dio's new album rules. Ozzy's last record was good too. Sammy is also on the mark. He recently finished a tour with the long since washed-up David Lee Roth. His band is in great form. He knows how to right good metal. This album sounds like classic Hagar all the way."
5,"Sammy says ""CHECK OUT HUTCH !""","Artist Joe Hutchinson of the band HUTCH co-wrote ""Not 4 Sale"" with Sammy Hagar. Check out HUTCH and support Indie Rock by purchasing ""TURN IT AROUND"" at http://www.hutchworks.net"
2,Definitely disappointing,"Lange is my favorite trance artist ever, so I jumped at the chance to own a second mix cd by him (the first being ""A Trip In Trance 3""-cd 1). And while the mixing was nothing less than Lange perfect, the track selections is what really disappointed me. And actually most of the artists on this album are usually on point, but on this album not so much. I definitely had higher hopes for songs on here by Ronski Speed, Mind One, Martin Roth, and Marco V. None of which made it to my playlists. My favorites in order, best being first are:1.""Tenso"" by Szartd & Trancejax2.""X Equals 69"" by Lange vs. Gareth Emery3.""Bermuda"" by Lange vs. Mike Koglin4.""This is New York"" by Lange vs. Gareth Emery5.""Infinite"" by skyform"
3,They divide cards,What can you say? They're plastic card dividers that go in between your cards and divide them. Slightly taller than the cards they divide so you can read a title you write on it.
5,Product Review,"This product was EXACTLY what I was looking for. It is sturdy and the perfect size for the box! Here are some extra, irrelevant words that I must throw in because Amazon refuses to let me submit the review I wish to submit otherwise."
5,Used book purchase,"Had reservations about ordering a used book but was pleasantly surprised at the condition of the book itself and pleased with the paperwork,delivery estimates and actual delivery.Also enjoyed the content of the book itself,a tale of gallant Australians turning back the Japanese in New Guinea from their advance toward Australia in WWII."
3,Kokoda trail for dummies,"I bought the book to learn about the Kokoda Track campaign and this book acheived that, but, it was written in some parts like a boys own adventure and with lots of cliches"
1,Maybe Not...,"It's a bit too short for anybody who really wants to learn how to draw The Little Mermaid at a thin 40 pages. The instructions don't give away anything that you couldn't figure out by looking at screencaps of the movie. If you're reading this, you must have access to a computer, so my advice is to just search for some images of The Little Mermaid and try to draw on your own. For very small children it's probably just fine, but for anyone age 10 and up, this might be a little boring."
3,Not your father's Sinatra..,"This 2 CD set features 41 tracks of songs associated with Frank Sinatra.Some of the songs are duplicated and performed by different bands. This is not your typical pop tribute to Sinatra. Grunge bands rework all the familiar tunes mostly beyond recognition. Thats a good thing if thats what your looking for. The feeling you get is an after hours inner city urban club with it's stoned young patrons, who only vaguely even heard of Frank Sinatra. Something different for sure! Not to everyone's taste!"
2,"Challenging problems, or just standard textbook stuff.","The problem with the contents of this book is that they are mostly standard, or require a simple trick. Many problems also require quite a bit of knowledge in higher mathematics, which may be good if you want to test that.However, this book is not for problem solving enthusiasts."
5,Wonderful songs beautifully performed and interpreted,This is a beautifully performed recording. The selections are tasteful and the interpretations masterful. The songs are the ones us baby-boomers grew up with and the way Mr. Dworsky evocatively creates them seems to reach far back into memory. I never seem to grow tired of listening to this recording. It has a timeless and melancholy quality to it. This is a wonderful CD to rock your children to sleep with.
3,OK,"Found better luck with other similar products, as far as MORE graphics... I feel I paid too much for this item. I am rating this as a neutrul"
1,Secret Places: My Life in New York and New Guinea,This book was written by a flagellant. Reading it is a painful experience.
3,Of interest,"Modern Pagans is a look at various individuals (in interview form) that the author appears to believe are representative of the Pagan community. Included are very well known figures such as Starhawk, Margot Adler, Oberon & Morning Glory, and Selena Fox. The book also includes minor players like Don Frew, along with several individuals that most people have probably never heard of.All in all the book provides an interesting overview of the opinions of some of the elders in the Pagan community today. The reader should be aware that many other Pagans have differing views and opinions that are not reflected here."
4,Vastly underrated,"Sadly, these stories, though well-reviewed at the time, have been forgotten. Townshend does an show enormous lack of self-restraint (but then again, so does his music).However, many of these stories are touching,particulcarly 'Champagne on the Terraces' The writing is at times poetic, the themes are fascinating, and if it had sold, maybe we would get to read more of his prose.The rap against Pete Townshend ahs always been pretentiousness, but with the execption of the title story, there's a shocking lack of that here. I recommend this book highly."
4,Just the Facts,"I enjoyed this book because Heck simply states the facts. There is not a lot of philosophizing - in straightforward language, he tells it as he experienced it. His story is interesting and moving and illustrates how children were used to further Hitler's goals. Heck died recently. I hope he has found peace."
2,not all there,"I ordered the mail slot for our new office, which is a beautiful home-like space with fine art and antique furniture, etc. We have no mailbox and the Post Office delivers inside our building. We wanted to put in a mail slot for the times we were not here, so I went on line to order one in ""oil brushed bronze,"" the only stipulation. I purchased this one thinking it did the best to match our hardware. When I received it - not having had a mail slot before - my boss called someone to install it. When they came, they explained that the slot had no back - what we would be seeing would be an open hole with raw wood and the back of the hardware. So, I am having to return this one and find another that is complete. There was no indication that anything would not be included with the item I purchased. Now we have had to put off installation until we can find another and wait for its delivery and contact the installer again. Why would one sell only half of a product?"
3,Had to return it...,"This is a quality product, but measure your door opening carefully. The flap has a hinge which protrudes into the door unless you have a tall opening. Not wanting to carve out a space for the hinge, I returned the product. Other reviews have noted this hinge problem (but I chose to ignore it when ordering. Ooops!)"
3,bryan ferry live,"bryan ferry's voice is unique in certain musical genres and hauntingly unique in others. his look was always and still is very slick and suave.the musicians that he surrounds himself with are just so perfect! i have never had the privilige to see bryan ferry live and i'm sure that there aren't that many people who can say they did so, all i can say is that this DVD is the closest you will ever get to witness the bryan ferry experience. unfortunatly most of the tracks are from his 'as time goes by ' album. don't get me wrong , these songs are great renditions in respect to the era they were first recorded , but bryan ferry has an even greater repetoire that i hope will be made availablein the future. [i hope that it may be a little longer timewise]"
2,Ferry-Lite,My excitement to find this DVD was quickly overcome by disappointment. Ferry was completely drowned out by the band. He labored throughout. This was the first show of a tour? I sold mine.
1,Not worth the price,"This book is a very amateur black and white copy of an old 1911 leaflet. The pictures are mostly illegible. The whole book looks like it was copied from bad copies. If you are a collector of ""all basket books"" you might want this, but for everyone else, skip this 44 page pamphlet. I'll be returning it."
5,Giglio's book on Musial is a winner,"James Giglio's recently released book on Stan ""The Man"" Musial is a winner in my opinion. Anyone can write a book quoting stats and on the field accomplishments, but Giglio goes back to the style that I most appreciate in a biography. He actually started at the beginning. Learning about Stan's childhood, his life in small town Pa. and his acsension into stardom was what I wanted when I bought this book. I always feel I know a little bit more about a person when I get to see what effects that person has had from events along the way. Certainly in Stan Musials case the depression, WWII, and the good years in the 50's and 60's shaped Stan into the man that he is.I give the book 5 stars and ask Mr. Giglio to find another superstar from yesterday to write about."
2,Musial: From Stash to Stan the Man,"I have read every book written about Stan Musial. I felt when I read this one the author was only interested in finding all the dirt he could find on this most wonderful person. I grew up watching this man play baseball. But most of all, I grew up watching a top rated human being. I really don't care about his personal life since I have met him many times and I don't have to have a book to tell the kind of person Stan Musial was or is. If you want to read dirt, than read Ball Four. That will keep you busy. If you want to read about a true baseball hero, I would suggest you read one of the other books about Stan Musial. They are what you could call real baseball books, ones by people know or knew the game."
5,Halarious spoof of old time tv sitcoms!,It's like a twisted good 'ol days! Very funny! Special effects & sounds are high quality.
4,Wild Turkeys: Hunting & Watching,"Goes through entre species and habitat. Kind of an insite into turkey behavior, as to the who what when, and why. Hope it leads to filling my spring bag."
2,Aaugh! Argh!!,"OK - Sonny was a wonderful human being and brilliant besides. Cher: What a treasure to the world of entertainment with a vocal style uniquely her own. However, even two great minds such as Sonny & Cher can have a dud. Granted - this is the early days of Sonny & Cher before the truly decent music began to emerge from their souls, but it still isn't anything to get excited about. Buy this only if you want it for historical purposes or if you are a Cher or Sonny & Cher completist. I have the original LP (for historical, collecting purposes) and, believe me, that is enough. A CD of this was really not necessary."
5,Great purchase,"I had saved this 130$ item in my cart for later, up until the price dropped to 90$. I found that it was a great deal, both with looks and quality! The construction is, however, somewhat fragile. I would not recommend wearing this necklace every day, but I love it! The only thing is that the price on this item keeps changing; you should consider waiting for ""real"" savings."
1,Tangled,Could not untangle the chain. Everthing was stuck together had to return. Do not order this looked cheap and nasty
3,Not bad for the price,These are a little dated and not quite the same as the Wiggles TV show. My daughter is not interested in anything on TV but the Wiggles show on Disney so I bought these to have in case we miss the time it is on and want to let her watch it a different time and she isn't as interested in these. She gets excited but loses interest. The songs may not be as fast paced and interesting as the ones she is used to.
4,Love the Wiggles,My children - both 2 1/2 - absolutely love the Wiggles and love watching these DVDs. They can't get enough of them! I definately recommend these DVD's for young children.
1,TERRIBLE!,"A woman I would think would not be interested in totally wasting her kid's time recommended this line of DVDs to me, so I got one - fortunately only one. It was TERRIBLE! I don't understand what is going on with all the hype and other fantastic reviews. The DVDs are mindless, way over-acted, Barney-esque entertainment with very little education. I really like Little Einsteins, Kipper and Dora - but if you are more of a Barney fan, maybe you'd prefer the Wiggles. Fortunately, my 2 year old did not get hooked before I discarded the DVD. Yes, discarded - I would not pass this on to anyone else!"
5,Wiggles Have a Hold on Babies,These DVDs are the only way I can get my baby brother to sit still for more than 2 minutes a day and get him calm enough for ME to be able to relax too :)
3,Middle of the road,"This collection has some middling Wiggles programming. One musical guest star DVD, a DVD with ""The Crocodile Hunter"" as a guest, and one set in Wiggle Bay. Compared to some other Wiggles productions, these three are firmly average."
5,Excellent History of Country Music,"Mr. Oermann captivates the audience with his knowledge of were country music came from, to were it has gone today. The book is full of illustrations and pictures that go along with the wonderful history of country music. And not only is this book very educational, but it is very entertaining. I think all country music lovers should have a copy of this book in their home."
3,"A grain of salt, please.","This is a good book for someone who knows nothing about country music or the people who make it.At first I was enjoying the information about artists that I haven't studied, but soon began to stumble across countless mistakes that made me question the authors knowledge. I wouldn't want to make a trivia bet from anything I read here.Of course, the rest of the world could be wrong and only Robert k. knows for sure. Basically I lost faith, and by the time I got halfway through the book I was so deluged by useless information and repetitious facts that I lost interest, began to skim page to page and................................................................................zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
4,"Geeks, Freaks and Girl Shows","Arthur Lewis give readers an unflinching glimpse of the world of carneys. His descriptions of the shows and showmen of the late 60's tell the story of a bygone era in carnival history that may never come again. Girl Shows, Freaks, Minstrels and a host of now politically incorrect attractions once were the crown jewels in any big traveling carnival. Lewis interviews the people who made the carnival what it was and what it has become today. A good read."
2,Expected to be placed inside the action of MMA,A long and drawn out exercise in futility. This is a futile attempt to capture what ringside audiences see. Instead it feels staged and indulgent.
1,Slow and Uninteresting,"Dragged out scenes of an athlete and models modeling. Not enough material about the art of photography, the photographer, the athletes, the sport or the models."
3,Not a bad read for the genre,"Overall I enjoyed the book, but felt a little disappointed in some of the plot shifts. I do plan on reading a few more books in this series."
2,Thriller,Good read. Keeps you guessing till close to the end. Good writing. Recommend to all those who really enjoy mysteries.
4,Another Winner for Gerritsen,This wasn't as good as some of the work done by Tess Gerritsen but it was still a good book. It didn't have as much suspense but it was well written and never dull. A must read.
5,The Surgeon,Fantastic read! Every now and then I read a book that I just can't put down and this is one of them. I highly recommend this one!
3,Certain to please most readers,"The idea that this is the start of a series about Rizzoli and not Moore is a bit disappointing. Let's face it, she's just not that interesting a person. And speaking of uninteresting people, the good lady doctor isn't that gripping either, she's the kind of character you find in a lot of books, but superficially so. The villian is compelling in that he's part of something larger and is quite the chameleon.The Surgeon is a good story outfitted with not-so-great characters, which for a large number of readers is not an issue. That said, I don't know as I'll be reading any of the other volumes in this series."
3,"""Thoracic Surgery for Dummies""","Although I found the narrative generally compelling and suspenseful, I was relieved to come to the final page. At times it seemed that Dr. Gerritsen was repeating a procedure for her surgery residents; ""Watch this again, students."" And again.As a newcomer to Gerritsen's books, I never realized that this was part of a Jane Rizzoli series. Although that character was nicely developed, she was far from the most engaging character. The italicized ""thoughts of the creepy villain"" seemed unnecessary interruptions of the flow; he was at no point sufficiently interesting to deserve all that space.If you enjoy gruesome and scary, but don't require an exciting love angle, you may love this one. I found it somewhat unsatisfying."
3,Suspenseful in its limited world,"Other Gerritsen books bored me; this book maintains a state of suspense quite well, and because it limits its focus and entrenches itself in the mania of an individual, it does not run into as many logical contradictions and unrealistic twists as other Gerritsen books. The characters are not one-dimensional cardboard punch-outs; they each have a psychological state as well based in a single past traumatic experience, so they're TWO-dimensional cardboard punch-outs, but still, for the sheer thrill of reading something that will keep you awake under the covers, this book is great."
4,Worth Reading!,"In typical Tess Gerritsen fashion, The Surgeon is a book that gets your attention right from the start and doesn't wane throughout this fast-paced medical thriller. The plot, which is described in many of the earlier reviews, is well-developed and exciting. However, I was a little disappointed in that I was able to guess too many of the events that ultimately occurred and the reasons for them too far in advance. Nonetheless, The Surgeon is well worth reading and should keep you engrossed. Enjoy!"
5,The Surgeon is sure to induce a panic attack.,"Tess Gerritsen is on top of her game. On the heels of her previous bestsellers, Life Support, Harvest, Bloodstream, and Gravity, she demonstrates that no one can come close to her in delineating medical plots that start and stop like a cardiac massage. Her attention to medical details brings the reader into the operating theatre of Dr. Katherine Cordell's skilled hands. Her psychological profiling of the antagonist takes the reader inside the mind of Cordell's assailant and nemesis. The ending is spellbinding. Her use of first person POV in the carefully scripted psyche of her protagonist and killer is crucial to the climatic build-up and ending. Everything is here: fear, love, greed, power, envy, impotence. Jane Rizzoli is gutsy and persistent in her pursuit of the killer and could carry a storyline herself. Thomas Moore's character could have been stronger, but his vulnerability to love matches Katherine's and forever binds them."
4,Gripping,The first two chapters set the scene for the rest of the book to never put it down. Tess Gerritsen is brilliant.
3,Excellent!,"I was roaming the library aisles one day and came across this author. Never having heard of her and her books before, I gave this one novel a shot. I'm very glad I did. Her novel was fast-paced, intelligently written, and hard to put down. The only complaint I think I had was I didn't feel like I got to know the character well enough. I like to connect to the characters I read or at least feel like I know them. However, to be fair, I think I might have to read a few more of her books to understand her character a little bit more.The Last Saint"
5,"Good mystery, thriller read","This was the firsts book of Tess Gerritsen that I read. It is always with anticipation that one reads an author for the first time because you do not know what to expect or even how to read the way the author writes.This was an excellent book. The characters were well defined and were real. The plot carried you along, not allowing you to put the book down if it were possible to keep it up and going on the story.I would be happy to read others books by this author because she kept my attention and enjoyment with the plot going.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,The Scream Extreme,"The Surgeon cranks suspense up to the scream extreme.A surgically adept serial killer comes back (apparently) from the dead to stalk Dr. Catherine Cordell, a beautiful cardiac surgeon who thought she had killed him when he raped her two years before. Now, he's leaving a bloody trail of eviscerated corpses as he closes in on the ever-more-frightened doctor while Detective Thomas Moore of the Boston Homicide Unit try to find him.It's a gruesome, creepy story you won't want to read alone in the hospital late at night.Dave Donelson, author of Heart of Diamonds: A Novel of Scandal, Love and Death in the Congo"
4,Great serial killer medical thriller,"The Surgeon characters fit great - great formula. The police are in conflict...romance issues...the surgeons in conflict...romance issues....sketchy details of possible psychos....daring clues like a chess game.... and the past is a conflict for several people, no one believing anyone or assuming the worse. The protagonist is in turmoil of her past and that keeps your mind busy with all the evidence pilling up.Great read!"
5,The Surgeon: A Rizzoli & Isles Novel,I enjoyed this book very much. Just when I thought I knew the ending it changed. I was sorry when I was finished with it.
4,Chilling,"Truly chilling and suspenseful. An evil villain that tortures women, steals something valuable from them WHILE THEY'RE ALIVE (you'll have to read the book to find out what That is), and finally, he slices their throats. He terrorizes women and Attacks our heroine. A good read."
5,Will read more by this author,"A friend recommended this book and I was skeptical because I saw the tv show which is based on the books and I'm not a fan. The book was wonderful, however. It was full of suspense and mystery. The author is also a great writer who obviously does her research when it comes to her characters. I found them using the typical lingo that law enforcement and medical personell would use."
3,Good Cheap Read,"I really enjoyed reading this book. The descriptions were very thorough. Some of the medical scenes might be hard to handle if you are not into that sort of thing. It was not a huge page turner but I did want to know what happened next. It just wasn't the type of book you keep reading even though you need to go to bed. I was disappointed that Rizzoli seemed like a side character and that Isles was not present at all. It makes me think that this book was originally going to be a stand alone and not part of series. It was a quick read, took me about 6 hours to read. The book was cheap and did what I wanted, entertained me on a boring Saturday."
5,Very good,The Surgeon was excellent. I enjoy how the author writes. You can tell she does a lot of research beforehand. Her stories twists and turns making it hard to know who done it until almost the end. Her books have litle sex and profanity; more story content. This is why she is a great author. A little gory during autopsys but it taught me about that occupation. I am reading all her books.
3,Bloody,"The book moved smoothly and quickly, however, the murder scene descriptions were much too gruesome and bloody. The entire story could have been told without all the sickening details of the abdominal incision and volumes of blood everywhere. All those details keep me from recommending this book to anyone."
4,Couldn't put it down!!,"This was a GREAT book! I have 4 kids and finished this book in 2 days! Needless to say, I stayed up way too late and didn't do anything I should have!"
3,"A good, entertaining read.","This was a free download, and I was pleased that this was not a second-rate novel. Fast-paced, detailed, and suspensful."
4,go read it today!,"I started reading the Apprentice before I read the Surgeon. About 5 pages into the story, I knew I had to stop and read the Surgeon first, and I'm really glad that I did! this book got me totally hooked on Gerritsen's series with Jane Rizzoli. The characters are a little rough in this book, compared to the books that follow, but the story is great and very creative. The love theme is a little cheesy, but it seemed to be a good contrast to the macabre story line and was written tastefully. Definitely recommended!"
5,1st Timer with this author WILL NOT BE THE LAST TIME!!!!,I chose this book because the TV drama Rizzoli & Iles was based on this book. I love the show and I LOVED the book. This is my first time reading a Tess Gerritsen novel and I can assure you it will not be the last time. A new & loyal fan.............The Surgeon: A Novel
4,Good Thriller!,"A copy cat killer is on the loose in Boston, terrorising young women, and killing them,in a very brutal manner. It is obvious, the killer has a medical background, and he is closing in on his ultimate kill, doctor, Catherine Cordell, a survivor, of the original attacker.This book should keep your nerves jangling, throughout. I know it's a bit of a cliche, but once I started reading this book, I found it hard to put down."
4,Kept me guessing.,"Two years ago Catherine Cordell was raped and nearly murdered. She shot the man who tried. She has now moved to Boston and leads a successful life as a Medic in the Pilgrim Medical Center. However some more bodies turn up dead, and the method looks very much like the previous killer. So is he dead?Homicide Detective Thomas Moore and his partner Jane Rizzoli start investigating and they keep running up against walls of doubt and confusion. That which links the women is startling.Not a story for the squeamish, the story sometimes gets caught up with the details but I found it riveting and entralling. I really suspected almost everyone in the story.Even with insights to the serial killer's head this is a taut thriller that kept me guessing. Everybody was potentially a suspect and red herrings littered the story. An interesting medical thriller."
5,This book should come with valium!,"Dr. Gerritsen is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors whose books consistently keeps me up late at night! A fast read that's hard to put down, THE SURGEON thrills even during the in-between parts. It's also a disturbing book that deals with various aspects of rape. Sure, we cheer for Catherine who has found the inner strength to not let the trauma of rape take over her life. Yet you can't help but feel for those who, years later, are still haunted by their ordeal. In our PC/New Age society, it's a relief to read an honest account that isn't afraid to call a victim a victim.Definitely one of the best thrillers of 2001!"
5,The Surgeon,"As an avid fan of mystery with a twist...such as Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal, Red Dragon, the V.I. Warshawski series and just about everything written by Patricia Cornwell, I was thrilled and delighted with Tess Gerritsen's ""The Surgeon"". It had everything I could have imagined, and more. I couldn't put the book down: the attention to detail, the heart-pounding, edge of your seat suspense was fabulous. The best thing about my adventure with The Surgeon was that I couldn't figure out who he was until I was hit between the eyes with it...and Dr. Gerritsen's use of descriptive language and imagery was second to none. Keep these novels coming!"
4,The Surgeon - lock your doors,A great read. Kept me up reading long after everyone else was asleep. The ending could have been a little more exciting but was a book that made me lock my doors.
4,A Very Worthwhile Read-Exciting Book!,"This was the first I have read of Gerritsen's books, and it was a good one!Catherine Cordell is a surgeon who is highly skilled in repairing broken people's bodies.There have been some horrendous murders taking place in the city of Boston. This killer would tear women apart by carving out their female organs, stabbing them with a scalpel, and leaving some dead, and others barely alive at the scene.With each repeated act of great violence, the monster comes closer and closer to capturing Cordell, and hurting her. The thing one, he did hurt Catherine once, and she managed to escape. But this time, she may not be so lucky. She's in this monster's obsessions all the time."
2,How long does this last??,"I'm into chapter 10 of my first Tess Garritsen book, ""The Surgeon."" I ordered the eight-book bundle on Kindle. I'm trying, I really am, but her constant whining about men is getting on my nerves. Is she always like this? It reads like a winner in the Lesbian Book of the Month Club. Somebody tell me it gets better than this."
4,The Surgeon : A Rizzoli & Isles Novel,I have been watching Rizolli and Isles on TV and started reading the 1st book about them. Really enjoyed it and will purchase more of these.
4,A Great Rainy Afternoon Read,"Although, I read this book over three days, I just did not want to put it down. It left me in suspense, and I admit my blood curdled on more than one occasion. Even though part of it is predictable, the ending will grab you. This is a fun book to read on a wet or cold day; it clips. I particularly enjoyed her varied locales and the characters of each. I also thoroughly enjoyed the author's last book, Gravity. Dr. Gerritsen is talented and should keep us turning pages for sometime."
4,Tense and gripping.,A good premise and the writing is intelligent. Gerritsen knows how to keep you reading and wondering. Keeps you absorbed till the end.
4,Surgeon,Good book keeps you interested only complaint was that Dr Isles was not in book. This was about Rizzoli only
4,"Great Book, But. . .","The ending is a blatant rip-off of the climax of The Silence of the Lambs. A very well-written rip-off, but a rip-off all the same.Otherwise, I thought this was a great book, well developed characters, good backgrounds on all of them, and avoidance of most cliches. The only thing I really didn't like was the characterization of Jane Rizzoli. She's the book's other female protagonist, someone we should be empathizing with, and to me, she just came off as a grade-A, you-know-what. Defensive about everything and uber-hostile to Catherine Cordell because she's attractive, and generally in need of a good smackdown."
3,average,This a a fast pace breath taking read. There were really no long drag but I could do without the romance in this book. I find some of the gruesome details very hard to stomach. It's not her best and it's not her worst novel. I like Gravity better.
3,"Easy read, enjoy the characters","The best things about the Rizzoli and Isles books, are the characters, the medical accounts and the police work. They are easy reads, but smart and engaging."
4,Amazing,wow. Loved it. i will read everything from this writer.nice imagination. new ways of presenting the genre. Rizzoli is not a usual policewoman
4,Manny does it again!,"Very helpful!! Like others, I have found much in these DVDs that was either new or though I'd read or heard before, Manny put in a such way that it sticks with me when I pick up my camera. Many aspects of photography are difficult to learn from a book, seeing Manny in action really adds another dimension of practical and valuable information. The composition DVD is thorough and extremely valuable, even though I'd studied comp before, Manny's clear, step by step approach seem to imprint it in a way that I can access it easily."
3,Strangely interesting,"At first I thought this film had too many elements. It has a special team that fight demons, each with their own skills. It has demons. It has a vampire. And, it has the pope. Yet, all these things just seem to work, because it's a film that doesn't take itself too seriously.It has the always hot Valentina Vargas as a vampire, who, when she feeds you actually see the victim's arm collapsing/deflating from lack of fluid!"
3,Bloody Mallory,"When the pope is kidnapped by a gang of ghouls, it is up to Mallory and her team of supernatural exterminators to battle their way through the bounds of Hell in order to save His Holiness! BLOODY MALLORY drops the fast-paced action of a Japanese animation into a Gothic Horror setting for an energetic and highly entertaining mix of martial arts and dark comedic horror. Julien Magnat shows no lack of ambition behind the camera, transcending the film's small budget with his emphasis on style and production design. The flashy costumes and eccentric characters give us the look and feel of a live-action comic book, but with sharp dialog that is more akin to the Buffy the Vampire Slayer television series. French phenom Olivia Bonamy stars as the sexy demon slayer, proving to be just as fit for the role as any Sarah Michelle Gellar or Milla Jovovich. When it comes to Horror Comedies, BLOODY MALLORY is a gory good time!-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
4,A Feast Of Weirdness,"I like this movie, because it was weird-like horror/comedy movie. Speaking French, it makes it that much weird. The characters seem like a mishmash but that get the job done. Sort of like Buffy Vampire Slayer stuff, though Mallory isn't a hottie as much was Sarah Michelle Gellar."
3,Worth the penny you'll pay,"This super indie from France is exactly what you might expect. It is pretty cheesy, kinda funny and very entertaining. There is an element of gore involved, and the plot is not the most original one ever...but for the little bit of nothing you can get it for...it is worth a pruchase."
4,A French Buffy,If any of you have seen Buffy the Vampire Slayer than you will enjoy this action oriented little gem of a movie.Of course i mean the TV series not the movie.The plot isn't anything to scream about but it's the action and how it actually feels like a tv movie that makes this a horror gem that it is.Rent it 1st but it's actually a keeper.
1,Not Great,"I was really disappointed. For the price of the book, I expected to have more that I could use for workshops for that age group."
5,Required reading for education masters program,"This book was required for our daughter's education masters program and it was very nice to be able to get it here for about fourty percent less than what her local book store wanted. Excellent. If required for you, compare and save here too plus get it quickly like we did!"
3,Great for elementary or middle school,"I chose this book to generate ideas on how to design a writing workshop for a high school classroom; however, much of the content and examples are geared toward elementary or middle school students.This book, like many educational books, seemed only to offer common sense advice rather than something new. You can read the entire book in one sitting because it's written in such simple language.Great ideas for elementary or middle school, but don't buy it if you teach above 8th grade!"
3,VERY basic,Not bad but VERY basic. I'm going into my first year of teaching and I already knew everything that was in this book. I don't feel like I gained anything useful from it. It's essentially a basic outline of the components of writing workshop. If you google 'writing workshop' you will gain way more useful information and ideas for mini-lessons that you can actually put into practice in the classroom. I would only buy this book if you have absolutely no knowledge or experience whatsoever with this approach.
1,Kindle edition ONLY,"I ended up returning the Kindle edition after realizing that I could not print the otherwise-reproducible forms from Appendix A. I tried highlighting and copying, but couldn't highlight the appendix pages themselves. Then, I futilely attempted to do a screen capture. I have been spoiled, I suppose, by my district's web-connected reading series, which enables me to print out reproducibles. I fully understand copyright restrictions, but Kindle needs to be brought into the current decade so that legitimately purchased reproducible forms may be printed in their intended format. PDF forms are fine with me."
3,Too basic,"I am an English teacher who has used various incarnations of a writing workshop for around ten years. While the info in this book was ok for beginners, it offered me really no new or useful tips that I hadn't already used or read about in other sources."
3,Good but!,"The book contains a lot of good Dreamweaver Ulta Dev (DWUD)information, but the author, in my opinion, places too much emphasis on databses, design, SQL, and normalization of tables. If you need a book with a good mix of DWUD, then this book may be for you. If you are looking for a book with examples and example code to go with it, this is not the book for you."
2,Does anyone know where the source code is?,"The book itself is fine, delving not too far into the advanced technologies.My biggest question is ""Where is the sample source code?"" If anyone knows, please email me at epross@sabrewebdesign.com. I see only chapters 15-20 on the CD and those aren't even complete."
2,I spent hours debugging the authors code!!!,"This was my first endeavor into the world of Ultradev - and I really wasn't in the mood for a trial by fire learning experience. After getting through the book, I now know quite a bit about Ultradev, but that's only because I had many opportunities to get into the code editor and fix the mistakes in the book! Very hard to follow and the author presumes that you know remember how to do some obscure coding from 7 chapters ago! I suppose you could learn Ultradev in 21 days - if you spend 8 hours on each chapter every day. I fully do not recommend this book."
2,Doesn't guide you thru building a dynamic site,Examples on the book are tough to follow and are not step by step. The CD doesn't give examples for all the chapters. I found this problem in other Sam's books. The author does give some extra info on what and how ultradev works buts I'm up to chapter 13 and it still doesn't give a coherent step by step examples to follow. I think all these 5 star reviews has to be the Author's friends.
2,Definately NOT as useful as I had hoped!!! VERY Disappointed,"I was very much looking forward to teaching myself UD in 21 days, but as soon as I opened the book I knew I had wasted my money! There are no clear instructions or step by steps....you don't know when you actually are supposed do what the book says or just read the information. I am not a beginner at Dreamweaver and I knew that if Day 1 and 2 were a little bit confusting for me, the real advanced stuff would be beyond comprehension. I got half way through with Day 2 and am already looking online for a different book."
2,I'm never buying another SAMS book again!,"I didn't realize that I was going to have a lesson in MySQL. I think that this book should have been written based on what you are likely to have in a production environment (i.e., Access or SQL server). I think Access would have been a better database for this book not only because it is more popular but the data could already be created instead of generating the table and all the data from scratch. Maybe it's just me but I'm very dissapointed with the Teach Yourself books. I will never buy a book online without physically reviewing it again. I was just anxious to get more information on Ultradev and this book was one of the first that came out on this applicaiton."
5,**** Techies - get me! ****,"Hehhehe... Borrowed this book from a friend who was finding it alittle bit above the learning curve he was looking for, but I loved the heck out of it. I guess it should be aimed at a higher level reader. I didn't, however, have any problems with the code - as long as you're using MySQL or a decent SQL server you should be fine."
1,The best example of a horrible book,"This book is not only useless but quite frankly it is horrible! The authors have no clear objective in their presentation of the material. The layout is even worse making it very boring and difficult to follow. The authors may know what they are talking about but they definitely don't know how to write good book. One begins to wonder if the publishers were in a rush to get the book onto the shelves. If you need a useful book, THIS IS NOT IT! It is amazing that anyone could write a favorable review for a book this horrible. This is the first review that I have written and it is because I am truly disgusted with the"
5,"This is da best,","This is damn good, I think they should produce a complete Album with this mix,I dont think a lot of the ""older"" Elvis fanatics will appreciate it!!!Welcome to the 20th century Mr Presly.. :)"
1,If That....Absolutely Terrible,"I know, I know, the recording is a huge international hit. You could say the same for Britney Spears. This is a lame Elvis cut when he was way past his prime, goosed up with some techno trimmings, in no way comparable to the work of such trance dance artists as John Digweed, DJ Jurgen, Paul Oakenfold and others. I expected an interesting mix of Memphis and Amsterdam. This is dull, repetitive, and utterly boring. I listened once and gave it away. Don't buy this record, particularly if you ever liked Elvis."
1,Are you people our of your minds?,"The people who like this version are absolutely nuts. This is pure destruction of a classic 1968 Elvis song. BMG needs to realize that Elvis no longer needs record sales to prove himself for he is the undisputed Performer of the 20th Century.There is absolutely no reason to start turning his songs into *NSTYNK style, no talent garbage. If Elvis never had another song on the charts he still couldn't be touched even by rubber-face Michael Jackson.Fans new and old show stick with the 3 boxed sets: The 50's Masters, 60's Masters, and 70's Masters, also Amazing Grace: The Gospel Recordings, and Command Performances: The 60's Masters Vol 2."
5,A LITTLE Less Conversation REMIX,"This is Elvis' new single. Some people don't like it because it is not Elvis's style. I don't really like the type of music they have re-mixed it to but Elvis could sing the [worst] song ever written and it would sound good. However this doesn't sound [bad]. This CD includes 3 songs:the remix version, the extended remix version, and the 1969 version."
5,Fantastic!,"As an Elvis fan, I am thrilled to hear this remix of an otherwise ""lost"" gem. The original stands alone, but this version brings a little Elvis back into our daily lives.Wow, it keeps you dancing"
1,"Elvis, brought to you by Nike","It's worth pointing out how this song suddenly (re)surfaced into mainstream pop culture. As international football (soccer) fans will know, NIKE used it to promote its advertizing during the World Cup in June, with heavy television rotation and a marketing campaign that has been estimated at well over $50M USD. Not quite the sudden emergence of a cult hit that has been reported, but another instance of the astonishing marketing power of a large corporation. Think of that when you drive past the neighboorhood club featuring local bands as you are listening to this record."
5,Wow!,"First, I hope Pricilla and Lisa Marie enjoy it as much as I (we) do! Second, we heard it sampled on the ""Ocean's Eleven"" soundtrack during the inflight movie while vacationing and we Loved it! Third, it rocks! One would think The King would've been happy to hit the vaults and refresh old songs, what better way to liven up the playlist then to breathe fresh air into it... musicians have gone acoustic, electric, orchestral, techno, sampled, industrial,over-dubbed, unplugged, accapella'd and whatever else has struck them to make their music work for them, why NOT Elvis's estate?! why wouldn't he if he'd been alive??? whatever else people want to think of him, he was no ""'ol fogey""!We're Dinosuar Rockers here, and my teenager and his buds roll right along with us, this is the bomb to them too!OPEN your MINDS and ENJOY!!Elvis Rocks! Long Live The KING!!!"
5,Popeye : Original Classics,"I think some of the absolute best and funniest stories and animation was done for these era cartoons. This compilation is very good with both classic black and white as well as color cartoons. I have always liked Popeye and this disappearing era of his adventures shouldn't be missed. I'd highly recommend getting this DVD if you like the detail of the animation, looks 3-D decades before 3-D, and the real humor of these cartoons. Really listen to some of things and comments Popeye says as he's mumbling along, hilarious!"
2,Not high quality,These are the same low end video transfers of these cartoons you can but at Wal Mart for half the price. There must be a cleaner version of this work but this is not it!
3,ok for looks,This product is good for attention grabbing stares but that's about it; not very comfortable.
3,I wasn't terribly impressed,"IMHO, the comparisons to Robert E. Howard are unwarranted: despite the occasional corker, Howard wrote intriguing adventure stories with exotic locations and larger-than-life action that captivated my interest and kept it in lockstep with the action. By way of contrast, I found myself dozing off over Lamb's prose, forcing myself to read two or three chapters and then laying the book down for several days. It's not that the material isn't historically accurate or that the characters aren't interesting, it's just that--as a whole--I didn't find that the book hung together. I was more than halfway through when I just threw my hands up and gave the book to a young friend who may find it more intriguing than I did. I, for one, won't be purchasing any more of Lamb's historical fiction, though I do own and enjoy his Genghis Khan, albeit far less than R. P. Lister's."
4,three palladins(tales of the clan),"at this point in time i cannot reveiw the book because i have not had a chance to read it yet,but the other stuff that i have read is any ikling of what to expect i will be looking forward to starting this book"
2,Not the full version,"This version of Card Studio 3 only has 500 cards, whereas the boxed version has 2,500. It's actually Card Studio 3 ""Special Edition"". It has a very limited selection of cards, like 8 birthday cards. I returned it and got the Card Studio 2003 one which is much better."
1,A waste of your money!,"I've loved previous versions of Hallmark/Sierra...but this is awful. It's a limited version and most cards don't allow any modifcation (so unless you just want to always send to Grandma, you're out of luck!). Don't waste your money on this product."
1,"Neither a reference, a guide, a tutorial, nor a workbook.","Neither a reference, a guide, a tutorial, nor a workbook. Toss out the glossy color images, reduce the oversized font, sift it down to the actual useful information, and this book could be printed on two pages. If the author indeed asked himself why an entire book should be devoted to HTML: Frames, perhaps he could have spared us all his answer and just produced a pamphlet. The sophomoric quasi-historical segment at the beginning of the book was perhaps added merely to meet some minimal weight requirement. Ziff-Davis Press sinks to new lows. One wonders at the propriety of using this as a required text in a web based course offered by... Ziff-Davis! This is one you will definitely want to throw away. Spend your money on a decent text, one which you'll be glad to hang on to and use as a reference."
2,Karl,"This fountain is beautiful - HOWEVER, the pump is very loud. So loud it competes with the water!! Save you money and time. Do not buy this fountain. The company should make a quieter pump."
1,Great for watering the floor,"If a wet floor is your goal, by all means buy this. Not only do you get to pay a chunk of $, unpack, assemble, clean up, then do it all in reverse to send it back, but you get to waste lots of time.Doesn't matter how you arrange the river rocks or how long you let it run--it gives you a delightful water spray that will add an exciting slippery surface to your interior floors."
1,Lights burned out,The lights burned out. Can't replace them. Junk fountain now do not buy. You'll regret it. . . . ..
2,If its not the pump then its the splash.,It looks great and is very substantial. We had not issue with the sound of the pump. It was pretty silent actually. Where thisproduct fails miserably is that is does not contain the water. It makes an absolute wet mess around the fountain.
1,Leaks,Product was hard to assemble. Directions were not clear. Pump was louder than water sound. It leaked from the base on the first day. I returned the product. Thanks to Amazon for the execellent return policy.
1,No help at all.,This book provides no help for beginners. The author often refers to expensive tools most people do not have. Horrible...
3,Very interesting exploration of sensuality and language,"She combines the source of languages and modern linguistics to create a sacred wordplay, a place of sensuality... with some small lapses concerning the reality of ecological disaster (the worst of the book without any doubt). Overall though, it is well worth reading, especially for readers of both Spanish and English."
2,For the amount that it pumps...,"a dipper would be as productive. This item would be helpful for transferring small amounts of liquid from one container to another, but for anything over a couple of gallons, it is insufficient to the task. I tried to use it to transfer 15 gallons of water, and after ten gallons had been pumped, I carried the rest of it in 1/8th the time it took to pump the ten gallons. It takes time to rig it with the hoses and the drill motor, and by the time that is done, you could have done all that it can do with a large sponge. There are other pumps out there, readily available, that will do the work with less hassle."
1,Useless,This thing was the biggest waste of money. I paid $6.98 for it and I'm taking it right back. It didn't pump a drop.
3,It worked,"This drill pump actually worked for me. I forced some water through it so it would not be completely dry and then started the drill. I created suction and pulled air through a couple feet (level) of hose and then started shooting water out. I would guess it was going at about 20 gallons/hr and able to pull a foot or two up. Used it several times, my hardware store guy said he uses it for oil."
1,Broken out of the package,"I bought this for a simple little pumping task, followed the directions, and hooked it up. It turned about 1/2 turn and stopped pumping water. The shaft felt like it was turning within the impeller hub. I could look in the end and see the impeller was not turning.Even though it is only an $8 item, I at least expect it to work fresh out of the package."
2,Not very good,Worked ok while primed. But didn't seem to stay primed well. burnt it up after one time while trying to winterized camper.
1,"Does not work, pure and simple","This product I purchased at a local retailer. In fact, I bought two of them thinking maybe the first one was defective. It does not work. Like most things in life, you get what you pay for. I ended up buying a product costing about $30 (Jabsco) and it works. The key to these pumps is that the fitting must be perfect and this unit makes it next to impossible to accomplish."
1,junk,i bought this to transfer water from rain barrel to buckets maybe eight foot total hose length( that is intake and discharge). would not pump with hose attached would pump small stream if you put intake end in water . i found this to be a big rip off and a piece of junk. would not recommend to anyone unless i really hated them( and maybe not then cause i really hate this pump).
1,Not Reliable,"I need this pump to pump a small amount of water (5 gallons at a time) from a water container into my pop-up camper when I have no city water hook up. I bought one and tested it. It slowly pumped the 5 gallons. When I tried it again, I got not water only smoke. So I returned it to Home Depot and bought another one. I noticed that the drill I had used was 1200 rpm and the package says to use a drill that is 1400rpm or higher. So I used a drill that did 2500 rpm and it worked fantastic. So I tried it again, but tried my cordless drill that does 1500rpm and all I got was smoke - no water again.At best I could say this item is not durable. If you buy it, make sure your drill does well over the 1400rpm(s) recommended."
1,Did not work,"I wanted to use a drill pump and siphon to drain bathtubs for watering diruing our Georgia drought of 2008. On the first test, I got some water moving, so I assembled hoses and bought a cordless drill. On the second try, nothing. I tossed it.I am disappointed."
1,Without anthony curtis anything called boom is bad,"I bought this recording thinking it was Anthony curtis' band BOOM--wrong--the music is lame no chops no guts no nuts--nothing they should have a disclaimer or change their name from boom to wimper o well live and learn. Please More music by Anthony Curtis and boom and less by these bozo's. In particular the Paul WATSON piece was not only weak with a poor structure but the time was very shaky but heh i was comparing them to the original boom of Pippin Barnett, Greg LaBudde and My man Anthony Curtis. For the real Boom i will in the future stick to them!!!!!!!!"
4,Great story with a few writing flaws,"This was an even more charming story than the first in the series. I found myself laughing outloud at the charming attempts of this couple, who didn't know each other, trying to make their marriage work. Was this book perfect, NO. It could have done a better job tying up loose ends at the finish. The villian walked off like a hero with no repercussions for his actions, kind of like modern day villians. The story and dialogue between the main characters in this book is worth the read."
2,Ultimately Disappointing,"The characters of Amelia and Kyle had great potential but they were mostly unrealized and the ending of this story was terrible. It didn't appear to be well thought out at all. After all the horrible things Richard had done, he sure became quite contrite REALLY FAST. I started to get really ticked off at Amelia toward the end. Kyle did come across as a much more well-rounded character but I never really saw what he fell in love with in Amelia. It was supposed to be SO deep but they really didn't have much of a well developed relationship.I really hope this author has better work because this ""ain't it."""
1,Speechless,"I found this book too confusing from the start. It had absoulutely no reference to the period in which it was set. I felt as if I were reading a contemporary novel because of the way that people spoke. The dialogue just wasn't written the way people spoke and thought in 1871. The jacket told of a charming story about Kyle and Amelia. If only that story had followed through into the book. For instance, the best friend from law school and the brother and the mother and the best friend's stepmother who slept with the main character(blah, blah, blah) had way too much time on the pages.I bought the book because Ms. Lindstrom was compared to LaVyrle Spencer - believe me, there's no comparison. I will give Shades of Honor a shot because that is her book that had so many good reviews, but I will look for it at the library."
5,"Mrs Nikolaeva, still THE REFERENCE, even in 1999","According to some recent reviews (of an otherwise beautiful performance, by Ashkenazy), Mrs Nikolaeva ""misunderstood"" Shostakovithc's inherent humor and therefore played the Preludes and Fugues too rigourously. Can you figure out? Cheek-in-tongue being the appropriate interpretation of this thoughtful work! With the ""petulant and occidentalized"" Ashkenazy, a fresh wind is blowing on opus 87, but it does not carry away the ""austere and oriental"" Nikolaeva, the creator and ... still the reference.Additional note: the sound of the re-edited CD is good. So, sound should not deter those who don't consider themselves ""collectors""."
5,One of the best,"Tatiana is not so popular to American audience but she was a big name in Russia: A teacher, a pianist, and a composer in Moscow Conservatory. She died in 1994 in the US recital tour. Unluckily, there's not much her records. This set is one of her wellknowns and can be thought as the best (compare to others, like Schebakov or Ashkenaszy). This set was Gramophone winner, Prix Maurice Fleuret's top 100 best CDs all time. May say Tatiana lived and died with these preludes and fugues. She died while playing these in a performance in SanFrancisco, 1994. You also can listen to Tatiana's Goldberg Variations of Bach, that is a really nice one too. I strongly recommend this set.Someone prefers to Keith Jarrett in Shostakovich's Preludes and Fugues. Do you think a jazzman can reach to the peak of classical? No. They're in two different worlds. Like a Classical pianist cannot play ""Functional"" like T. Monk."
3,"Hey Universal, for the last time , this is season four , NOT SEASON SIX!!!!!!!!","Like the reviews before me , if I wanted the series like tv land I would have recorded them from tvland. If anyone from Universal are reading the reviews, (which I doubt) you'll see the customers want the real deal. I wrote to Universal when season three came out , and they tried to tell me that those were the best quality they had , if that was so than tell me how the vhs copies from Columbia House were better including the season four episodes they released. We wait one year and it is worse than the season three release. So this means that we have to wait another year for a crappy version of season five. Thanks alot Universal, thanks for ripping us off."
3,Love the show...crappy sound!,This DVD set was worth waiting for except for one thing. The sound is awful. I have to turn mt TV way up to hear anything and then the volume kicks way up and then back down.I love the show and always have. It was very realistic for it's time. 1974 was scoop and screw medicine. At least they made some efforts on the show.
1,I might get to enjoy these soon!,"It has now been a month and I am still waiting in high anticipation for all four seasons to arrive.It has never taken this long to receive a package from Amazon before and there is no way to track where this package lies!Who knew it took this long to get a package to Australia.When they finally do arrive, I am sure they will be great!"
3,Disappointing,"I'm happier to have this DVD set than I would be not to have it at all. But I am disappointed by the mediocre picture and sound quality and that the open was replaced by the final season's open on each episode. The DVDs from the previous three seasons, with a few exceptions in Season 3, offered good quality picture and sound and the right open for the season. Episodes from those discs were a much greater pleasure to watch.Frankly, the Season 4 DVD quality is something I would expect from a bootlegger.Universal, if good-quality prints of Emergency's remaining seasons exist, please use them to make the remaining DVD sets."
2,Emergency! season 4 no effort at,Just received my season four of emergencywhile picture is ok for a show from 30 years ago the sound track is poor and at times out of sync. Sound quality is variable and though i am not sure of this it appears that some scenes have been shortened.the only plus for this season is that i dont have to watch the universal logo 22 times.If you are going to restore sneek previews why not remaster the whole season. Certainly not a season i will be watching more than onceEmergency! - Season Four
4,Emergency! Season 4,"I remember this show so well from my childhood. It is somewhat cheesy by todays standards! The medical portion is funny if you are current in EMS! One of the best things is that I can watch this with my daughters, (13,10,5) and it not be too over their heads or too immature for me. We enjoy talking about what is happening and discussing how some things have changed.I love it!!!"
3,will not be getting anymore,after the release of season 3. i was done with the show. im not wasting my money on bad picture and sound quality.
5,tv show emergency dvd season 4,i can wait to see season 4 of emergency i like the firemen stuff alot i watch emergency all the time on dvd.anne mariebig fan of tv show emergency
2,Won't use free shipping again,"I love Emergency! and have been looking forward to getting season 4. I live in Conroe,Texas, just 4 hours from where the DVD is being shipped from. It was shipped on January 27, 2008. Here it is Feb. 4, and I still haven't gotten it. It just left Dallas today. Never again. I could have driven to Dallas and picked it up myself."
5,Ouch,I highly recommend this!!! He's very funny and you will not stop laughing from the moment you start till it ends.
2,Very Disappointing,"Pablo what happened? Where's all the funny stuff you did on the first DVD (Bits and Pieces). I Loved the first DVD so much me and my friends actually quote alot of the material. It seems like Comedy Central had held Pablo back quite a bit. Alot of the material was not funny, or he would make comments that had little to no relevance of the joke he was making. The Jackie Chan and China town skit was really drawn out and very irritating ""Leave Me Alone"".. It just wasnt funny. The Brokeback Mountain Skit was entertaining as well as the William Hung and Ecstacy in South Beach. But this DVD does not even compare to his first... What a bummer.. But I still like you Pablo, your still my number 7 friend on Myspace..!"
1,I think Pablo is hilarious...except in this DVD,I've seen many of Pablo's performances but this one was just bad. I think he is hilarious especially with a lot of his impersonations but this was just bad. I don't know if he had an off night or what but 25 mins into it....I had to turn it off. I would look at other dvd's of his...definitely not this one.
2,Not Too Great!,"This was a definite let down. It is too bad that Pablo's first DVD since Bits & Pieces cannot nearly hold a candle. Bits & Pieces was far more funny, enjoyable, and original. I have seen him live once and am going to see him again in a couple of weeks. Hopefully it won't be the same garbage. If you are looking to laugh your butt off, don't purchase this DVD, purchase Bits & Pieces."
1,disappointed!,this was not funny at all.i've seen pablo francisco's stand-up on HBO and was pleasantly entertained but this dvd was awful and boring as hell.
2,doesn't fit Makita BO5010,"Just an fyi for you Makita BO5010 owners out there. The outside diameter on the exhaust port on the BO5010 is 7/8"". The inside diameter on the connector on this hose is 3/4"". The 2 will simply not mate without major surgery to one or both connections.If there is a God, he will sentence all Makita tool designers to an eternity of sifting through dust port connectors that don't fit."
4,Very Special Australian Music,"When you walk in the centre of Copenhagen you are bound to run into some kind of entertainment. Often the entertainers are foreigners who have come to Denmark to play their music, often based on their own cultural background. This type of music is often called World Music. RiverTribe, from Australia, is just such a band. They could, without a doubt, have been playing in the streets of Copenhagen casting spells on people with their incredibly emotional didgeridoo based music. RiverTribe take time building a meditation atmosphere and the time is well spent. If you want music to enhance a romantic moment this will do it."
3,Not for this price,"This is an alright album. Nothing major. Not even an album of big hits. Just an recording made in the early 1970's. The notes are good, but I wish this was a 26 song CD of their big songs. My advice: Save your money until a better CD is released."
5,Excellent Postrock from Athens GA,"One of the most elegant and efficient instrumental rock band that I've ever listened to. Can be easily compared to the best of Mogwai, Explosions in The sky, GYBE, Do Make Say Think. Overall production could be better but the compositions are so good that this is undoubtedly a 5-star records for the genre. Don't know if these guys will ever play again on stage, but if yes don't miss them live - I've seen them 5 or 6 times and they were just AWESOME."
3,Motions going,"Occupying the graying space between the non-confrontational melodies and pacing of Tristeza and more gritty rip-offs from post-rock powerhouses Explosions and Mogwai, Maserati is your textbook thrift store guilty pleasure if the genre is worshiped, holding moments of uplift and subtle sonic acknowledgement despite obvious derivations."
1,If one could actually write Tripe then this author accomplished it,"Purchased this at a discount barn. Could not make it through the over the top purple prose. Obviously the author read a Tom Clancy thriller and tried to write... A Tom Clancy thriller- which is good news for Tom Clancy. Why? Because this attempt proves that writing a credible story is NOT easy.Ridiculous scenes, set ups and unbelievable card board characters make this one of the crummiest books I have picked up. Granted after page 30 it might have improved- but I would rather drill a hole in my head than try to find out.To bad Amazon does not have negative ratings- say a ""black hole"" rather than a star.With regards to the other ""glowing reviews"" these HAVE To be schills for the author. No one would put their reputation at risk stating that this book is worthy of anything other than the recycling bin."
5,everything you need to know,"If you are not going into surgery - this book has more than enough.If you are - get this to study quick facts, then get a textbook to supplement."
5,Get this and read it and you will honor,"Everyone talks about this book and the information in it is great and very relevant. Keep reading it and you'll do well on your shelfs, on the wards and whatever else. I used this as a third year and I just kept reading it until I had it almost memorized. The chiefs on my rotations were surprised the stuff I used to know from this book. By the way I got the advanced one too and not nearly as helpful as this one."
5,Great book for surgical clerkships,"Book contains the basic information necessary for a surgical clerkship. It reviews questions surgeons love to ask, contains information you need to know and basic anatomical pictures relating to general surgery. Small enough to fit in jacket pocket. Would highly recommend it-- a larger text may be helpful for more background info, but you probably wont have time to read anything like that anyway. Passed my surgical exam reading basically just this."
5,As essential for surgery as Netters is for Anatomy,This book is awesome. I did a hardcore surgery rotation in a major level 1 trauma center and this book practically matched nearly every question asked of me while on clerkship. Excellent for the shelf exam as well.
3,Good for wards - not so good for shelf,The information is in a Q&A form so you can study on the go. It does provide pearls for when you're on service - such as what are the lines of tolte? Would use to prepare for wards - before a surgery but not for the shelf. The information isn't detailed enough to explain certain concepts to you.
5,what SF is really all about!,"Four novellas that are everything that is great about science fiction. These four authors are absolutely among the greatest voices in the genre today.In WATCHING TREES GROW Peter Hamilton took history, turned it upside down, shook it a bit & gave us an alternate view of a history quite unlike anything I had ever read before.Stephen Baxter's REALITY DUST made the reader look at reality in a whole new way.In MAKING HISTORY, Paul McAuley showed how history is not always written by the victor.Ian MacDonald's TENDELEO'S STORY took me back to the Chaga in EVOLUTION'S SHORE which always impressed me as being one of the most possibly real First Contact stories ever written.All four novellas explore the very trait of our species' survival, adaptability, that brings hope & after all that's what science fiction is really about."
2,Hard to find trailheads and poor maps,"A GPS coordinates is all you need to define a place now - Google it you will find it. I had hard time to follow this book's directions to find the trail heads. Also, maps in the book are like maps of amusement parks."
4,The perfect accompaniment to the video.,This book has some of the best photography I have ever seen. It is an in detail look at the various wildlife of India. From the magnificent tiger to the crocodiles and birds that inhabit the vast natural habitats of this wonderous sub-continent. No one would believe that India was so beautiful. But most of all it takes and in depth look at the one true King of the Asian Jungle- the mighty tiger. And who better to write about them than the tiger guru Valmik Thapar. It is WELL worth the read but get the video first.
4,A splendid showcase of Indian wildlife,"I first saw the television series and then moved on to the book. Both the book as well as the series are a very good showcase of the diversity and beauty of indian wildlife ... the book is not about the tiger, unlike what some might mistake ... its truly about the land of the tiger - its forests, its climate, animals, birds, trees, and people.The photographs are excellent - this is a good overview for both the tourist as well as the enthusiast."
3,It's ok.,"We used this cookbook for a while when we first got it to try some things out, but we rarely use it now. When I look at it I think, ""unimaginative"". I honestly think my biggest hangup is the fact that there are no pictures of the food. This is probably silly but for me the way the food looks is important. My husband is much more accepting of ""basic"" food than I am and he likes it more than me.Overall I think it was a bit disappointing."
2,Disappointed,"I thought this toy looked great for my 5-year old son. The pieces are colorful and seem fairly durable, but my son cannot put these animals together on his own. It took me almost 30 minutes to figure out the dragon. Once together, we were very disappointed that the dragon is flimsy and falls apart when handling. What's the point if children can't play with the animals? I am super disappointed in this product for the price and would not reccomend it for young children."
4,Bloco Dragons/Reptiles,I got this as a gift!! I have not heard how they liked or disliked. BUT others who have bought have given it mixed reviews.
5,:),"As there's such limited official content for Invasion America (basically just this book and the novelization), any fan of the original show pretty much has to at least read this book. It covers events that Rafe brushed over in the first episode with his line about Rita becoming their guide, their friend, and, for Cale, something more. As such, it makes an interesting read for novelty value alone (compared to the novelization, which covers events seen in the show-- not boring, per se, but not fresh, either). You see Rita and Cale marry, David's troublesome birth, and the formation and trial-by-fire of the rebel Ooshati.(Original ""review"" removed as it was written when I was in junior high and apparently rather excitable.)"
4,DAVID LIVES!,"I just finished this book, but I can only give it *** out of 4. One reason was that there were spelling mistakes scattered throughout the book - I laughed out loud when ""the Dagit fell silent, brooding."" Another was that the book was noticeably more violent than the show - the series was rated PG, but the interrogation scene and Susie's death (is that her name? I can't remember) bring it up to about 14-V. And the dates in June 1981 were completely hosed. In fact, the date of the first chapter doesn't make that much sense either. It should be 06/08/1998, not 04/12/1981. Remember the space shuttle from the series? That was obviously not 1998 technology, and I don't know why everyone else insists it was.Go to the Invasion America Newsletter and the Invasion America Snail-Mail Petition websites to find out how you can help save IA. Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to include URLs in a review, so you'll have to just email me.PS: Be sure to celebrate David's birthday next January 13!"
2,Entirely Too Many Mistakes,"This book contained some good information but was filled with too many errors. The errata from the publisher's web site does not cover even half of the errors, and contains errors itself! Even at a clearance price this book was a waste of money."
3,Not well organized but still help,"This book is not well organized compared with other MCSE TEST PREP books. There are lots of wrong answer in the questions which will wast your time for sure but it still provede some helpful information. Remember, all these book are reference only. If you think you can pass the test with only one book, you are either very good or you must be dreaming."
4,A Great Supplement for the 70-63 exam,This is a great supplement tool for the NT Server Exam (70-063). I studied from this workbook in the two weeks leading up to the exam and passed. I'd highly recommend it for MCP/MCSE candidates studying for the 07-063 exam. Go ahead and order it already!
3,A good summation of test material but error-prone,"The book should in no way be your only source of test preparation material nor does it advertise itself to be such. The practice exams following each chapter were helpful for giving you an idea of the types of questions you may encounter on the exam, but I noticed it contained many errors. Some of the errors were very careless which makes me wonder if portions of the book were proof-read at all.Overall, the book is helpful at highlighting the keywords and concepts, and types of test questions which you need to pass the exam despite the many errors."
4,Fat book of facts,"I found this book a delightful conglomeration of every fact you might want to know about a city and it's livability. The catagories were population,economy& jobs, Cost of living, Climate, Education, Healthcare, Crime, transportation, Leisure,arts& culture, and quality of life.The charts, tables,and maps kept me in a sense of discovery! The info is really easy to understand and not too abstract. Peter Sander and Bert Sperling, the authors have a great background and created a very flowing publication."
4,Very thourogh,"Excellent reference book for anyone out there who is contemplating relocation but don't know where to go. From crime statistics to air quality, from climate patterns to high school graduation rates, this book is the best I have seen. The one minimal complaint I have is a listing of number of Starbucks in each metrolpolitan area. While I am not a coffe drinker, I guess a little advertising never hurts. Overall, though, an excellent choice."
2,Cities Ranked and Rated,"Please don't use this book if you are looking for a place to relocate, you might end up in Cleveland, OH. As a resident of the Cleveland area I found many discrepancies in the book. Some of the information such as the condition of the city and the best residental areas appears to be from five to twenty years out of sync.I looked at several other cities around the country which I am familar, same problem. My book is on the way back."
2,Good efforts but bad ranking,"WOULD BE USEFUL IF MORE ACCURATE! ZIPCODE SEARCH Feature is excellent IF INFORMATION were ACCURATE!I lived in several places for relatively long period of time: San Francisco--6 years and Minnesota 3 years. However, I found the stat inaccurate. For example, the area that I live (Richmond disctrict) is one of the safer areas in the city in contrast to the bayview/bayshore area (which has lots of happenings and many shootings over the past years and news reported that cops were reluctant to petrol those areas). While the zipcode search reflects that the safer district has as many violent crimes and murders as the relatively known dangerous areas. This is something that needed to be worked on further. I am sure the book like this kind is useful but accuracy information counts!"
1,Bizarre,"As a former reviewer mentioned, the methodology used for determining the best places to live in the U.S. in this book is utterly bizarre. The most obscure, po-dunk towns all get top rankings while Portland Oregon is the only city of any size that appears in the top twenty or so listings. Now, Portland is a great city, but you'll find Seattle, New York, Los Angeles, Boston and San Francisco all down below the obscure places. The bottom line is that everyone has different things they are looking for and a city slicker like myself would never, ever be truly happy in a city under a certain size or in a highly 'red' political climate. Why oh why Wiley publishers chose to replace the excellent Places Rated Almanac (published since 1981) with this new book is a mystery! Get the 2000 edition of Places Rated Almanac for a more practical look at the best cities in America."
1,Charlottesville housing costs,"Charlottesville rated the best place to live in America. We made a special trip there to check it out. Housing is ridiculously overpriced. It's a nice area, but expect to cut your house size and standard in half if you want to live here. I am surprised the authors didn't factor that in more when they rated it #1."
3,Mystical Russian Soundscapes?,"An odd title if you're not buying it for meditation purposes. Anyway, this CD covers an expansive amount of reportoire. The rarely heard Madrigal Ensemble of Moscow is represented by the first 8 tracks, which consist of extremely rare music you probably won't find in too many other places. Finally the listener is suddenly transported from early Russian unison chant (No. 11) to a full Bortniansky concerto (No. 12). The rest of the selections are all polyphonic, although I'd argue that they are not ""Russia's finest choirs."" I'd recommend this CD up to track 12."
1,I suggest you not to read it!,"This book call ""The World To Come"" could not keep people to read from being and continue to the end of the book. When I was start read several page, I able to understand well. When I was read several more I start have hard time to understand and what the book talk about that page. For example My is Mike, I have hazel eye it was green and brown. I used remember my mother always show much love when we connect our own eye to each another. More like of soft heart, that mean people who have soft heart used talk like that, when someone do wrong and horrible people who have soft heart able said ""That oK I will forgive you"", ""Try again like Jesus not give up when he fell up he start again carry the wood cross"". The People were not soft heart could say ""Oh my boy not again"" ""Why you doing this"", ""Please help me understand this"""
4,Amazing! Fits in to the other theories of the millenium,"I haven't read her other books yet but understand this one is a good one to start with. It was easy to read and actually easy to comprehend. I have more hope for the coming world (and my children) and less fear for the coming hard times. More hope, less fear, it must be good!"
1,It not work,"It did not work, just on and off the doors but the alarm is not activated or disabled. Send an email to the four technical advisers and only one answered but I still could not be put to work.I put in the jar of thing does not work."
3,Praying with Mary,This book is not what I expected it to be. The old prayers in it are worded much like the bible. Sometimes hard to understand what you are reading or reciting. I was so looking for a book of prayers easy to read for my young daughter.
4,Mt Biking,"Good introduction to mt biking - simple style, uncluttered, just enough to get started and not too much info to drown in"
5,My son loves this book!,I bought this book for my kindergarten age son. My goal was to teach him about the purpose of earthworms and how helpful they are to us. He now is caring for a bin of earthworms that we have gathered around our property. He has learned how to feed them and care for them and how to make wonderful compost.
3,I Really Wanted to Like This Book...,"I really wanted to like this book but I found myself struggling to finish it. No doubt, the experience itself was immeasurably exciting / interesting, but the book was, well, kind of boring.It could have easily been half the length and not lost much, and as another reviewer indicated, I never really got a feel for what is so great about crawling though caves. I'm sure it IS great, at least to those who are as into it as these people are, but I didn't get why or how from the book. I also found the third-person writing style a bit contrived, somehow.If you DID like this book, I would highly recommend 'The Last Dive' which is in a similar vein but I found very exciting and extremely well written."
5,Gripping Adventure,"You don't have to be a caver to enjoy this book. With the help of indespensable illustrations the authors paint a picture of a cave system with a life (and legends) of its own, and the story of a crew with a resolve to discover its depths. Anecdotes and suppositioned dialogue aid in endearing the crew to the reader as we follow the challenges, determination & yearn for discovery that accompany Bill & Barbara to the ""mother of all sumps"".... or the beginning of the next exploration."
2,Basic Overview Of A Reenactment,"The story of the battel is well told. The flim work could have been set up better.None-the less, a very solid film for what it is. Nice to have in ones collection."
2,Disappionted,Didn't care for music on this CD. Was looking forward to listening to more of her traditional irish folk songs. I may try exploring some of her music again before I steer away from it
5,"Awesome Music, Awesome Voice, Awesome Recording","Recording wise, this is one of the few CDs that hi-end audio stores use to test and showcase their systems. Need I say more?Musically, the songs are very enjoyable - a little pop-ish with an Irish touch. The arrangement is extremely good, flowing seamlessly with Mary's clear voice.Overall, it's one CD you have to own. If you are into hi-end audio and own a hi-end turntable, you've got to hunt down the vinyl version of this record. It sounds much much better on vinyl."
5,Pure Vocalist evokes strong traveling urges,"Mary Black is a pure vocalist whose lyrics evoke the urge to travel...in ""No Frontiers"" and ""Columbus."" She makes me want to go off dreamily into the sunset.. searching new horizons and far off places. ""Vanities"" is reminiscent of an old boyfriend or two. This is a set of evocative, wonderful songs... Marvelous for a relaxing Sunday morning with a cup of coffee and the newspaper."
4,"Great work, Robbie!","A terrific first novel, I'm sure it will ""work"" for a)Mormons and b) folks with little exposure to Mormons in Utah. For the rest of us, the unwashed masses of non-LDS living in Utah, the characters ring a bit untrue--kinder, more compassionate, more tolerant than experience has shown us. After 30 years in Utah, it's tough for me to suspend disbelief, but I have no doubt that the average reader will be greatly entertained by Robbie's well-written effort. I am confident that anyone who has suffered or stood witness to the suffering many gays endure when ""coming out"" to a Mormon family will certainly benefit from reading this terrific novel."
5,A lovely book!,"When I read this book, I think of meeting a friend who understands and encourages me - and we're having tea. Elizabeth Berg's charming voice comes through clear and strong as she encourages, gently nudges and inspires writers to celebrate their calling. I loved it! Whether you're just beginning, experienced, published or unpublished, this book is warm like a treasured quilt on a cold night. Buy it and enjoy."
5,What a delight!,"Elizabeth Berg's clear and descriptive style sprinkled with wonderfully inspiring quotes make for a fabulous read. ""Escaping into the Open"" is 223 pages of ""Atta Boy, You can do it!"" Although Anne LaMott's ""Bird by Bird"" is also a terrific book on the craft of writing, ""Escaping into the Open"" tends to be more positive and upbeat."
5,Wonderfully motivational!!!!,"I am a big fan of Elizabeth Berg's and I was thrilled to discover she had a book on writing. As a stay-at-home mother and published writer myself, it was wonderful to read about how Berg started. I was pleasantly surprised by the recipes at the end and I always enjoy Berg's direct, though quirky, sense of humor. I highly recommend this book, especially to women looking for some writing inspiration. This is the only book that I've read that has writing exercises I actually look forward to doing."
1,Over-rated,"I disliked Ms. Berg's book from the introduction onward. Unlike the previous reviewer, I would not place this book in the same class as Anne Lamott's Bird by Bird or Natalie Goldberg's Writing Down the Bones, which are both fabulous writing books. Ms. Berg seemed more interested in detailing her own accomplishments than in anything else. Spend your money on Lamott, Goldberg or Ralph Keyes (The Courage to Write) instead. Authors who will truly help you to begin to ""write true""."
4,Great Book,This is a really great and inspiring book for those who are writing. It has really good and interesting exercises for practice. I mist def recommend it.
3,Padded Content,"This publication was not up to Berg's usual captivating standards. It felt like a little bit of good information and a lot of 'padding' to make it longer. The first few chapters had some excitement and inspiration, but then it fizzled."
4,This was a gift......,"This was a gift for my western buff son-in-law, & he loves it. He is talking about getting more. He has a number of western-themed decor items, & this went nicely with them."
3,Lessens the arthritis pain in my hands,I have arthritis in both hands and have tried various supplements that did not help. I purchased and used one bottle of the Source Natural product and did not immediately repurchase a replacement. It was during the interim that I realized how much worse the pain was without the the product. I ordered more and will continue to use it daily.
3,so so,"I wouldn't buy this again but am keeping it. Case has already been dented and the handle has been stuck twice. Also, the material isn't actually that lite."
2,Russell Athletic Jersey Pull-on Pants,this product has the right weight for working out in. light enough to not get overheated.biggest problem. lousy manufacturing and quality control. pants rip at the seams in less than 4 weeks. poor stitching. otherwise workable.
4,Product great; just not the colors.,"I am a spouse buying for my husband. He likes the pants OK but not the color. It would be nice if they came in a lighter blue.He has trouble with the navy picking up light colored lint (or cat hair, since we have a white cat.)"
4,Good,"The order showed up on time and the pants are comfortable and looks to be made with pride, care, and durability. The only thing negative (and this is not unique to these pants) the length of the legs have grown in response to the increased waist. For whatever reason, the companies that manufacturer ""big"" just increase the leg length along with the waist. I wish they would realize that us that have ingreased girth not leg length."
4,Love em,Nice Large comfortable Sweat pants!There's plenty of room to move around in them and they are very comfortable and warm.
4,Needs bigger pockets,"These fit well, and are true to size. I ordered a size up to have room to move.The fabric is fairly thin so you overheat in the summer like you would with sweatpants.If I had to change one thing I'd make the pockets bigger or at least deeper. I ended up having to buy a hip pack because there was NO WAY my wallet, keys and cell phone were going to fit on my trips to the gym otherwise."
4,I like em.,"These pants seem well made, fit well and are comfortable. Sized just right. What more can you ask for. No complains. 4 stars for a job well done."
2,Gathered ankles does not appear in picture,Very disappointed. I thought these were ungathered ankle sweats and my husband looks like a complete dork wearing them. Would not reccommend. Too thin as well.
1,crotch split,The threads in the crotch pulled apart leaving a 6 inch gap. I only wear these around the house thus no heavy gym use. After spending the high price of nearly $30 on a pair of sweats I expected a lot more. Russell price at Walmart quality. I will never buy Russell again.T-
2,Don't waste your money,"Bought XLT...nice fit, adequate length, roomy, but very cheaply made. Material is paper thin and some seams came apart the very first day. Would not buy again."
2,too small,i bought 5x's. they fit like they were 4x's. i was very unhappy with my order.i wish they were larger
4,Great pants for a tall husband,"My husband does not buy any of his clothes he's 6' 4"" and has a spare tire so extra large tall fits him perfect. i can never find that size in our local stores...so only shop for him on line. Preferable at amazon."
1,Cheap crap!!!,Thin flimsly material not worth the money do not buy !!!!!! Also they are made in Packistan that is no friendto the US
3,nice and lightweight,"these pants are nice and lightweight. great if you want to wear sweatpants but not the super heavy ones.had these pants for about 3 years before the stitching started to wear out in the crotch. considering i only wore them in the winter, they didn't a large amount of use in those 3 years."
1,Don't spend your hard earned cash.,This is honestly the worst purchase I have ever made from Amazon. It's a man standing in front of a camera talking. Just horrible. A brutal waste of money. Worth about 99 cents. Would rate it no stars if I could.
1,It does not match what the description.,It is the first DVD in a set not all in one DVD.The way teaching is stupid. I am BS in teaching.
5,Wonderful,Math is my worst subject and this DVD brought me up to speed. I also bought the advance disc and work sheets. Some of it is remedial but I needed it and the discs worked!
2,Product didn't meet my expectations,"First, I ordered one set of DVDs from Amazon. Instead, the Company sent me three sets of DVDs that were the same. It kept charging my account three times of what I originally intended to purchase.Second, I looked at the DVD which I purchased for a third grader and it was extremely disappointing. I could have created better lessons. It was very short and shallow. The instructor covered limited topics and his explanation was mediocre. I would not recommend anyone to buy this product."
5,Great aid for the classroom,I run parts of this DVD in my class and the students really like it. I use it to supplement my own lessons in elementary school math. Two thumbs up on this DVD!
2,Limited Value,"This book has limited usefulness for non-denominational students of Isaiah. The author pays lip service to alternative interpretations, but his obvious Christian biases and editorial comments are frankly annoying--suitable perhaps for Wednesday night Bible studies--but not useful for independent scholars.The reader can learn from the author's knowledge of Hebrew and ancient history. Not a bad book but not very good either."
5,Primary Commentary On Isaiah,"As a pastor preaching through the book of Isaiah I find this book to be the first one off the shelf when I get to the commentary portion of my study. Over and over Motyer has appropriate thoughts, sound exegesis, thorough cultural understanding, and descriptive wording. I do wish he had done a translation to go with it. I will continue to use the book for years to come and will also continue to recommend it to my congregation (some of whom have already purchased it). I use this in conjunction with Edward Young's 3 Volume set titled ""The Book of Isaiah"" and some others"
2,Great Strategies... poor quality,"I was rather disappointed with this book, it has great strategies to get thought the game however, but they could at least improve the picture's quality! they're awfully dark! besides this book doesn't tell the location of Alucard's Sword one of the most powerfull items; and it doesn't explain the special habilities of each sword,instead they were content by giving us the exact same vague, short description of the game's items. but not their propeties. This could have been a lot better."
5,star wars.,"I got this for my grandson,he loves it.starwars is his fav.it,s hard to find these things in the stores,but i find everything i need right here.thank you guy,s."
2,"Reading this, you would think every destination is fantastic...","...but they are not. Like every other travel magazine, this one reads like a sales pitch from cover to cover. Every article describes a perfectly heavenly place to visit. No mention of overcrowding, bad value, and so forth. I don't expect the places I visit to be perfect. But I would like to have an idea what I am getting into. This magazine does not deliver. Just to be fair, none of its competitors do either."
4,Conde Nast Traveler,"Received two issues so far. Magazine is packed with 4 and 5 star information and as most magazines like this, too many advertisements.I do enjoy reading it."
3,Do You Like Ads?,Way too many ads in this magazine and not enough travel content for the regular traveler. I won't renew this subscription when it's time.
2,Situation with Amazon's magazine renewals,Just takes too long a time to know whether your subscription has been processed correctly. Just received the newest issue and it still does not show the new renewal date. SUGGESTION: Make your partner send your clients like me a confirming email stating that the renewal is being processed and when it should show up with the new date! Hope my renewal takes.Conde Nast Traveler (2-year)
3,CondeNast Subscription,"Very tough to review this product because the delivery will not take place until some time end of Apr to May /10, even though bought and paid for in Feb/10"
1,Have not recieved this magazine yet,I am still waiting on this magazine. Was my subscribtion lost? Please advise.
1,Conde Naste subscription,"I think all magazines should be scent free as there are so many people with allergies and I happen to be one. I cannot use the magazine unless it is. Therefore it was a waste of money for me. Most magazines are becoming scent free, I was surprised that this one is not!!!"
3,"Sadly, Cathy from Texas hit it dead on...","I've been a subscriber to CN Traveler since its inception, but for the past few years my renewals have only been made in the hope that it might, somehow, return to the excellence of the ""good old days"". I remember fondly (in fact, still have) the early issues with articles about freightering around the Marquesas and touring Ireland with a very personal slant, in search of heritage and an Irish passport.Don't get me wrong, I enjoy reading about glitzier destinations as well (yup, I even enjoy the adverts!). But I CRAVED CN's arrival when travel, not consumerism, was the focus. Now, I find myself tossing the latest issue out unread if it has a ""Top 100"" on the cover. Once in awhile, fine, but 3 or 4 issues a year based on this premise is just ridiculous ""filler"".I found these reviews on my search for a replacement travel magazine. Not throwing in the towel yet, but I don't see much to excite out there. Maybe T&C; Travel? Wish me luck!"
1,Not for me...,"I got this free with another order, and I still cancelled my subscription. It is definately geared toward people who travel a lot for business and for pleasure. It seems to focus on frequent flyers and on cruise ships. I would prefer a magazine about local and exotic locations, with more photos.For someone who travels a lot for business, I think this would be a good resource, but for myself, it's not worth reading."
1,I quit subscribing to CN Traveler,"And here are the reasons:I do not want to read top 100 lists for hotels, cruise lines etc.Too much advertising and very few articles.I can get a lot more information online from Tripadvisor, [...], Yahoo! travel and many many other sites.Lately, it feels like some articles were writeen on demand; some very expensive hotel/resort pays a fee to be featured in one of their stories.No travel off the beaten path, just the same old overused travel destinations."
3,Magazine for the non-budget traveler.,"This was a free annual subscription from Amazon and the reason I signed up is because the description said ""Conde Nast Traveler requires its writers to travel anonymously and pay their own way"". I presumed this meant the locations would be affordable. My mistake!! Unfortunately I just can't afford to pay over $600 a night for a hotel room or thousands on a weekly vacation; suffice it to say I won't be renewing (although I did get good ideas for possible future places to visit)."
3,Too much on super high end travel!,I would like to see more information on great places that aren't only for the 1%. We can afford great vacations but not at places starting at $500 a night.
3,Too Many Ads,I got this at a great special price and my subscription started really fast.Unfortunately there are far too many ads and too little content.Still if you like to travel you will enjoy it.
4,Travels of the Rich,"Conde Nast Traveler is a magazine for the wealthy or the want-a-bees. The magazine is geared mostly to North America and Europe. It tells where to eat, shop or be seen on the two continents. For example, an article will inform the reader of a new five-star Sushi restaurant in Florence, Italy. Thus, if you plan to travel to Florence for Sushi (not Michelangelo), this is the magazine for you. It is a great coffee table magazine for the armchair traveler, for the pictures are gorgeous."
3,Conde Nast Traveler,"I'd subscribed to CNT a number of years ago. I enjoyed the photos of beautiful scenary. I read articles of interest to me (foods, local cultures, etc.) Now, there are fewer pix and more advertising. I'd always enjoyed the Conde' Nast Traveler in order to DREAM and perhaps, someday, go to faraway places. (I know, ""dreams"" don't book flights, etc.). I won't re-subscribe after this year ends."
1,ZERO STARS - It's been 4 months and still no magazine!,"What can I say?!? I ordereded this product in early 9/06 and it is now 1/07 and I have yet to receive a copy of the magazine, but my credit card was charged for the full years subscription the next day. I guess I'm not happy!"
1,Bad Idea to buy from Amazon,"because it doesn't come for 6 months after you order it, and you can buy it from Conde Nast and get the same price, but start receiving the magazine right away. Amazon's website doesn't highlight these facts until you make the purchase, probably inadvertent, but annoying all the same!"
1,Bills but no Mags,"I kept receiving bills, but would not pay because i had not received a single magazine. I continued to call, and they insisted it had been corrected. Today, i finally got a hold of someone who cancelled my account for me, and will be trying this again. Hopefully i don't have a collection agency out there hunting me down."
2,Travel,"I felt this magazine focused to much on advertising, I work part time as a travel agent and I'm able to give my clients more tips and insight with National Geographic's travel magazine and Budget travel"
2,In the minority,"I had a subscription to this magazine years ago and let it laspe. I recently picked it up again and I will not be renewing it. The magazine is obviously geared toward folks that like their information in the highly abbreviated form.Articles are usually extremely short and not very informative in my opinion. Less than one page is not unusual. Sometimes I have a hard time telling if soemthing is an article or an advertisement.I wish I could recommend another, better travel magazine, but I just haven't found one.Since I'm obviously not in the main stream on this one, I'd suggest that you buy a couple of copies off the newstand before making the commitment to a year or more subscription."
4,used to be...,"I used to love this magazine. It still has some excellent articles, but it is true that there are way too many filler issues now with top 100 lists of things I have no interest in (resort hotels, spas, expensive travel agents). However, on the flip side, it never talks down to the reader - the audience is assumed to be well travelled and somewhat sophisticated - which I appreciate. I checked out Nat Geographic Traveller hoping it would be like the CN Traveller of old, but although it has nicer photography (with few gratuitously scantily clad female shots), it seemed much more mainstream - like I had already done many of the ""dream trips"" befor I hit my 30s and the information also seemed much shallower. I like Geo, but I struggle through the French and it's a lot more expensive."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"This book stands alone as one of the few books I considered giving up halfway through. The characters are horrible, the pathetic manner in which the protagonists give into the Fey is depressing, the characterization of the Fey is totally cliche...I could go on. I can't remember many details of this book, as I read it quite some time ago and was totally disgusted by it, but the horrid taste it left in my mouth remains.Do not read this book."
1,Not Worth the $5.20,"""This book is not to be tossed lightly aside, but rather hurled with great force."" Dorothy ParkerI gave up at the first 1/3. The characters were caricatures, the plot was plodding and the writing was marginally worse than Mercedes Lacky (and that is an achievement).I realize the author has written some other books that aren't terrible (her star trek collaborations are pretty readable), but this one should not have been published until there were at least three more rewrites."
3,Good Plot But Boring,"It has a great plot. All the rest of the books in the series does too. Also, interesting characters, with strong personalities(most of them). Interesting world, too. BUT there is the fact that it doesn't manage to muster up enough suspense to keep us really interested. And the world view is not detailed, or realistic, enough to make us feel as though we're really inside the book, feeling along with the characters- it all too often reminds us that the thing we're poring over is just paper printed with words. Because of this fact, I never managed to read the books straight through- chapters were skipped, pages were turned without being read- but because the plot was always interesting, only the narrating lacking, I did go through all the books. If you have the patience, this may be a very good book for you."
2,"One smells, one doesn't.","I bought a 65 cm ball and a 75 cm ball. The 65 cm lost its sick sweet industrial plastic smell very quickly. The 75 cm ball gives no evidence of ever losing its smell, even though I left it outside in the sun and weather for a while. I guess it will be an outside play ball for the kids, as long as it lasts.If you don't mind one more chemical odor in your life, then read the other reviews and decide."
3,Not as good as her others,"Yes, CD has a great voice, and this collection of her songs showcases that. However, compared to HILL OF THIEVES, this albumn is lacking in excitement. I found no songs I simply had to listen to over and over. ""There Were Roses"" is unfortunatley a sappy tune about the Troubles that I found sophomoric."
4,Slow Start,"A very nice story about a young man who has some family problems and decides to leave home and go to work for a railroad at the turn on the last century. The book is filled with drama and suspense that keeps you turning the pages. If you are interested in what it was like to work on a railroad, there is a fair amount of that detail. The only problem I had with this book was getting through the first chapter. I does set the stage for the entire story but I almost stopped reading early on. I'm glad I kept reading."
3,"Ok, but could have been better",This book is ok for a start. Maybe because I have been doing genealogy so long I wasn't impressed with it. Maybe for a beginer this would be better.
5,Still putting out great music!,This continues on the Firehouse legacy. Another top studio CD from a great hard rock band. These guys have never stopped (unlike many of their other contemporaries) and there is good reason why. This is some solid music and a great live band.
2,Prime Time isn't worth $ 25.,I'm a fan of the band Firehouse. I have all of their albums. I must say that the Prime Time album isn't worth anyone spending $25 when you could buy the album at a used cd store for $10 or less. The album had some good songs but I was let down by the album in general.
4,Learn the basics about canoeing,"The material presented in this book is easy to understand, and also entertaining. The entire book can be read within a day. I recommend this book to learn the basics of canoeing."
4,A thin booklet with pleasant content.,"This book by Gwen Marston like the others in the series ""Twenty little quilts"" that I have read so far has 18 quilts shown in color on the inside of the cover plus 2 on the backcover. The photos are small and you can see little detail, but you can easily grasp the concept of each quilt. Some of the colors are not to my taste, but that will just keep me from copying any of the quilts exactly.Patterns are provided with both template and rotary cutting instructions. A short annotation with each pattern gives a little additional info about how the quilt came about and I appreciate that. The templates are included in a take out section in the middle of the book on light cardboard. Gwen says she makes little quilts to be able to try a lot of different ideas and you can either follow suit or develop the patterns into larger quilts.I came across those books after reading Liberated Quiltmaking and find them a good additional source."
5,Best thing that came out of Texas since the Cowboys,this might have been one of the best cd's i have ever heard i have 3 copies in case they scratch!
2,Juvenile Fiction??,"Storyline was more geared toward mid-teens (if you removed the few pages where the hero/heroine slept together near the end.) The book also moved at a snail's pace, contained far too much repetition, held way too many inconsistencies, was riddled with misspelled words, and had Civil War ghosts who never stayed true to their era.The heroine was too much the ""wounded-bird."" All her emotional angst kept dragging me down and the hero kept switching what was most important to him. Also, the way the hero/heroine kept gazing at each other but shying away before any connection was made throughout most of the book became quite boring. I didn't feel all warm and cozy with the ending. When two spirits were fighting over one body, obviously one of them had to lose. This story didn't make me feel like cheering."
5,How can he play like this!?,"I have bought several set of Liszt's etudes, but this recording by Berman is absolutely the best. He has an inhuman technique; for example, at the climax of Mazeppa, he plays faster than any one else. His range of expression and dynamics is also second to none. If you are interested in these twelve etudes, this CD will not disappoint you."
5,Great unit,I installed this unit on a job and have been very happy with the function. I did not have my line tester with me so tested with my laptop just to see if I could connect. Later when I retested I found three lines that were crossed or otherwise incorrect but the switch fixed the errors and all were working anyway. One slight problem is that the fan is a bit loud. I installed the unit in an office space and the sound is noticable. It does not seem to bother the workers so I left the unit as mounted.
2,The Real South,"Over the years, I have purchased dozens of copies of Forty Acres and a Goat"" by ""Brother Will"" and given them to friends. Cambell uses humor of the south mixed with the seriousness of the racial tension of the 60's,He blends in a nice quantity of animmal love and the quest for a simpler life to what can only be described as a most thought provoking book about mankinds' religious beliefs.As with his other books ""Forty Acres and a Goat"" is difficult to find as all who have read them cherish them.A must read."
3,Bob is Boring,"The dvd collection arrived in new condition and there were no problems with the order. Unfortunately after viewing the DVD's, my 2 year old is no longer interested in BOB. He loves the Bob toy tool belt and other Bob toys, but the DVD's were not age appropriate. After we watched the DVD's I found myself yawning as well. My opinion about this collection is that there is not enough building is going on, no songs and story lines that are more age appropriate for 5 and up. Before you buy this collection, make sure your child is crazy for Bob or your wasting your money."
5,Affordable collection,A wonderful addition to any Bob the Builder collection. At a price like this you just can't refuse. These dvds usually sell at no less than $12.99 each. You will find no better value than this!
5,Perfect gift and easy to buy.,"Bought this as a gift request for my oldest who seemed to love it. Quick and easy purchase, will shop again."
4,Just a collector,"I only purchased ""these guys"" because my husband is a huge StarWars fan and I am a toy collector (just small scale) I will give these to him for Christmas. He had never seen these before and I think he will get a kick out of them."
5,An Excellent Instructional DVD,"""Forward Motion,"" by Carl Verheyen, not only showcases Carl's amazing playing, but breaks down his approaches to creating lines for soloing and creating melodic chord development. In 30 years of playing, I personally found this DVD to be one of the most eye-opening instructional videos that I have bought - particularly for those players who want to understand more about intervallic approaches to soloing and chord playing. I was able to almost immediately incorporate the concepts in this DVD into my playing. In addition, there are some great band performances that illustrate Carl's approach, and a great segment about Carl's live rig. I highly recommend this video."
2,There's No Tab!,"Ok, it's Carl and that's cool. But there's no tab. It's just a discussion and presentation. Nothing to work on outside of the dvd. He shows some nice practice ideas and interval runs but no tab to reinforce the presentation. It's like owning an old vinyl album, lift the needle and move it back and repeat.Did I mention: No tab."
2,Abysmally boring... for law students only...,"As a Texas public school administrator, I highly recommend never spending a moment of your life reading this. There is a much better book called ""An Educator's Guide to Texas School Law."" If you're a Texas educator, I would buy that book and avoid this one. This is a college text intended for LAW students. I was forced to buy this for a school law class as a part of my administration degree. What a waste of time. It's nothing more than a book full of case law pertaining to public education in the United States. Things your SCHOOL LAWYER should know, but not necessarily you. Your lawyer should summarize and/or you should read a more to-the-point book summarizing it.Short version: if you're not a LAW student or a LAWYER, this book will do nothing more than bore you to tears."
3,Gets the Job Done,"The information is presented in a sequential format and is easily understood until the last couple of paragraphs of each case where the authors give their opinion of the court's ruling. It is difficult to understand what the courts actually decided. I often found myself wishing there would be a simple statement giving the final verdict. It is a good read until the ambiguous verdict, than frustration sets in."
4,School law,The book is great for administrators who need to learn about school law. The book can at times be confusing. There should be additional reviews of the cases involved in the chapters.
2,awkward setup,"I am a law student, and this is by far the worst book I have ever been assigned.50% of the text is a summation of relevant case law, without many of the supporting facts. Normally a law school book is mostly cases. It is very hard to go through the learning process (digesting the case yourself) when using this book.Additionally, the book is laid out in two columns, which makes note-taking especially difficult.Basically, I would recommend avoiding this text if possible."
2,American Public School Law,"The book was in good condition when I received it. I was forced to purchase this book by my grad school for a grad school class. I am not very impressed with the books summarization of the cases and in order to really understand the cases, I have had to go to Westlaw and review the entire case. The book omits information that I deem as important and puts in a lot of fluff or irrelevant information. The book does however; provide a good listing of cases by topic for School Administrator to have a jumping off point."
4,Used this book for Master's course,A good reference and complete in presenting cases for review and study. I have also loaned it to colleagues for their use.
5,My husband the professor is very pleased with this.,"Who knew we would be able to find this textbook on Amazon??!! Hubby lost his original copy in hurricane Katrina, so when he was assigned to teach the class again, he NEEDED to either replace the book or find a newer edition. As always, Amazon came through for us!"
3,American Public School Law- a great resource,"Once you get past the first two chapters, which are heavy with law-jargon, the book is a great resource for anyone in the field of education. If you're in a position to have parents questioning your administrative moves, this source should be kept in an easy-to-access location. It will come in very handy!"
4,A great reference for school law...,I was required to use this text book for a graduate class. It is a very comprehensive resource for school law.
5,Every administrator needs one,I ordered this for a class I am taking but it is not a book I will be selling back! This is a book one refers to often.
5,Great deal!,"The product arrived in perfect condition and in far less time than I expected! I used the super saver, free shipping feature and expected serious snail time. It came in three days!"
3,GOOD READ,"I bought this book simply because the news of this plane crash really disturbed me. For me, there's nothing sadder than to lose a loved one in a plane crash. Especially because airplane trips sometimes mark the end or the beginning of something in a person's life. The book is definetely a good read. The story is really interesting as well as compelling. I think that what really makes it work though, are the letters David wrote. He truly had the ability to write what he was thinking and feeling. Maybe he was a talented writer after all. It is clear that the writer's intention was to come to terms with his brother's passing. And it seems that after many years he finally did. As I said, a good read. Give it a chance."
2,Disappointing,"Having lost a close friend on Pan AM flight 103, I was really looking forward to reading this book. I was so interested in reading the perspective of a victim's brother, and felt priveleged to read such a private topic. I certainly respect Ken's pain and appreciate his bravery in facing his feelings. However, the book is just not that interesting. It starts out with a gripping account of Ken and his Dad hearing the devastating news, and Ken's trip to Lockerbie was fascinating. After that, I really lost interest because there is just way too much detail given to David's rambling journal writings and Ken's wandering life. I would have loved to read a book about the tragedy, and a more concentrated, edited story about rebuilding one's life after such a terrible loss. Midway through the book I had to keep reminding myself I was reading about something related to Pan AM 103. The book really lost its focus."
2,Misses somewhere,"The premise of the book was interesing...a man finding himself through the exploration of his brother's life. But it lost my attention somewhere. I put the book down for a couple weeks and then finally finished the last chapter. The beginning of the book was compelling and moving. However, by the end, I just didnt care about the outcome. The author, in my opinion, while he tries, did not fully convey how he was able to move on.As others have stated, i tried to like this book, but couldnt."
3,not good enough,"The opening was challenging and frightening and I was looking forward to sharp middle and ending. Too much focus is spent on David's very mixed up psyche and an overindulgence of his talent. Ken followed in the footsteps of David, including his taking over David's girls, and finally marrying one. Both David and Ken suffer anxieties probably inherited from their manic mother. I got nothing very much out of this reading except wanting it to be over. David died tragically but his writing ability (if such) was overrated."
5,A fitting tribute,"David was a classmate of mine at Brown, someone I wish I'd gotten to know better. As good a writer as he was (and he was brilliant), I think Ken is an even better writer. And I think that somewhere, David is thrilled to know that. The Boy Who Fell Out of the Sky is a beautiful, evocative and excrutiatingly painful read; I can't recommend it highly enough."
2,A really good story in there somewhere...,"The premise of this book is very compelling, containing the makings of an intriguing and haunting memoir/biography. Indeed, the early chapters are well written and quite promising.But the story gets lost, bogging down under the author's self-absorbed meanderings, and his heavy reliance on rambling, not-so-brilliant excerpts from David's notebooks.The book falls short because Dornstein fails to examine what's at the center of all this: his own fixation with his charismatic and deeply troubled older brother.There is a universally true story in here, tragic and quirky and surprising, but Ken Dornstein may have been too close to be the one to write it. Too bad."
1,Writer looses himself in search of brother...,"This book begins wonderfully, and somewhere around the middle gets totally off track. He just gets bogged down in things that aren't all that interesting. I understand that he's coping with the loss of his brother, but it seems he did it in a really long, weird, and unhealthy way. I had to really buckle down to finish this one, and just wanted to tear my hair out over the last 35 pages. If this had be about 50 pages shorter it could have been sooooo much better.P.S. I think his brother was probably mentally disturbed."
3,chill out chucho,"Half brilliance, half wankfest. I just wish they he wouldn't mix the two on every track. Unfortunately he chooses to display his monster chops in a very unmusical way that detracts from the MUSIC. You can almost hear the audience wishing he would stop abusing the piano and continue with the tune. But the rest is just fantastic. I'd love to hear him play a set without all the fireworks, it's unbecoming. Tatum was positively restrained in comparison."
3,Could be a lot better,"I got this product because I've heard good things about buffalo, and wanted something that would last, such as the draft-n. The problem being the wireless on this router would time out, and the router would need to be power cycled every few hours, nearly worthless as an access point out of the box. Tech support stopped responding to E-mails after we moved past ""have you tried firmware update"" and ""have you tried mac address cloning"" after that they wouldn't even respond. Eventually I figured out that their DHCP support is broken, and by cutting lease times down to a short period like 1-2 hours, the wireless would stay up. Strangeness. After fixing that it works okay, range is pretty pathetic."
2,Not Very loud.,"I ordered it and tested it in a quiet room of the house, and it wasn't any louder than the ringer on the actual phone itself.I contacted the seller and they were very gracious about allowing me to return it."
1,"Definitely not ""Extra-Loud""","I purchased this bell ringer for our manufacturing floor so that the second shift could hear the phone ringing over the running machines after office hours. This is definitely not an ""extra-loud"" ringer; just like the other reviews (which I failed to read all!!!) it sounds no different than a standard phone. Totally useless for a manufacturing environment. Don't waste your money. I'm not even bothering to return due to return shipping costs and 20% restocking charge."
2,Ringer was not loud!,"The ringer was not as loud as the ringer on my home phone! But if you are handy you can bend and add parts to make it work for you, but if not don't buy it you will be disappointed!!!"
1,extra-lousy,"This bell isn't louder than a conventional house phone. I needed something loud, so I can hear the phone ring over all the other sounds going on at the shop... and well... this did not live up to its hype in its title, as being ""extra loud"". The shop bell I had before this was so loud, I could hear it while painting with the spray booth fans running..."
1,Died,"Volume is just a little louder than a regular phone. Worked o.k. for knowing phone was ringing while I was in the yard. However, died after about a year. Will be looking for a different model."
5,Soul Dancer,Amazon is the best place to buy those CD's which are moreeclectic and limited in quanity
5,What a watch!,"This watch is not only attractive, it's waterproof. I do allot of underwater swimming. It's also hot tub and shower proof. It draws attention. I tried to get another one but they are out of stock. I am a Casio Fan."
3,It's okay,"This soundtrack is okay for me. Seriously, so so. It is because the fighting music and the other ones are not in it. However, the songs from this movie are good. Therefore, it is still acceptable."
2,Curious...,Does anyone know what's the name of the song that's been playing recently for the commercials for the DVD??? The song definetly is not on this soundtrack sadly.
3,Ignore emo nation,"Forget the negative reviews from the iTune-damaged mainstream rock fans below. They didn't get their Dashboard Confessional and Hoobastank fix and are clearly confused by actual music. This is a strong collection of originals, including a stellar Flaming Lips track that fans of the band will need, and the Walkmen, Black Mountain and Yeah Yeah Yeahs songs aren't far behind."
1,Not even worthy of a beer coaster !,"Ok a got this CD free from a radio station giveaway. I tried to listen to 30 secs of each song but soon i had gotten to the end of the CD. I quickly removed the CD and threw it out of my window. It SUCKS!!! If you're intrested in purchasing this CD don't bother, there is a free one on HWY 17 near Charleston SC!!!!"
1,Disappointing Followup to Spiderman 2 Sndtrk,"If you like rock music and were a fan of the Spiderman 2 Soundtrack, stay away from this CD!!!! Its full of the new wave of fake rock/pop whiners and no real rock substance. Other than the Wolfmother track, the rest of the songs are throwaways that you'd hear on the local pop station. Its definitely a disappointment as the movie looks to be phenomenal and the music just doesnt seem to flow with the storyline at all. If you made the mistake that I did and bought this album, give it to your nearest cd trade in store or ebay it."
5,The Japanese Bathtub.,"This book reveals the Japanese Bathroom. It makes one wonder why we in the USofA do not have these luxurious tubs. Instead we are stuck with rediculous shaped monsters that do not fill with water and are the most uncomfortable shape. I doubt if soap bubbles ever enter one of these tubs. It seems like they are meant for soaking. What would American kids do with these tubs....toys, bubbles, multiple children, more toys."
3,Lots of Tatami - Not a lot of Onsen,"Lots of pictures in this book, but most are of the inside of the ryokans, tatami rooms, and scenery. Not a whole lot of pictures of the onsen's."
4,Good DVD - good service,Firstly the DVD is not region specific: it works fine on a European/UK region 2 DVD player and a region 2 PS2 without any problems.Delivery from the US to the UK was quick - about 8 to 9 days from dispatch to receipt. Excellent service.The DVD isn't really for *complete* beginners rather the teaching has a more intermediate feel about. Well structured lessons and a nice variety too. You can't really go wrong.
5,Amazing instruction,"There are a lot of good mandolin players. Chris is the best. Not only is his technique great, he composes amazing music. He's also very diverse when it comes to genre. The icing on the cake is that he's a great teacher. If you play mandolin, this DVD will open your mind. My only gripe is that he only made one instructional DVD.CHRIS, MAKE MORE INSTRUCTIONAL DVDs!!! Teach us ""The Farmer and the Duck,"" ""Old Cold Coffee On the Dashboard,"" ""Fence Post in the Front Yard,"" ""Attaboy."" It would be great to learn the tunes and the theory behind them."
4,Very satisfied,The dvd was a gift for my son. He is a big fan of Chris Thile from Nicklecreek and had discovered the dvd when he began playing the mandolin recently. He was very pleased with it.
1,Definately for beginners,"Definately for begginers. He also needs mandolin classes, his tecnique is not so good, specially his left hand!"
5,6 pack,"Great way to get them, I feel the burn after a few reps with them. Get them you wont regret it. They are also made out of metal not plastic, added bonus for me."
2,I do like them BUT the pads came off both and you have to glue,them with a special glue that the company said is called Goop you can get from any hardware store etc!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Way to Hang!,"The GIB2 Inversion Boots, most definitely helped my back, as for the last two months, my back has been hurting. I injured it doing squats a few years ago, and every now and then, it just acts up with no warning, so I thought I'd try these boots. The only complaint I have is that they need more padding, as they really hurt the ankle to the point that it gets very uncomfortable, even with the extra padding they include. I cannot hang as long as I would like to, due to the pain from the boots.Other than that, for the few minutes that I am able to, it does relieve the pain in my back, and my back does feel better. The ankle pain goes away faster than the back pain, so you aren't swapping back pain for ankle pain. Only while you are hanging, does the ankle pain happen."
2,"it breaks after a month, so don't waste your money","The unfortunate problem is that the padding for this product is poorly glued, and so eventually that glue gives out, leaving you with inversion boots that don't work and need to be fixed.Don't waste your money on this product. I now wish I had gone a different route, but I thought I was getting a good deal paying only $50 some bucks for a pair of inversion boots... I was wrong.Make your money count, and get the high-end model!"
1,Body Solid Inversion Boots,"The boots don't fit right. Not enough padding, and the latch is loose, even with extra padding. I don't recommend these boots. I have other Body Solid equipment, and their quality is excellent...not this time..."
1,Body Solid GIB2 Inversion Boots,This product doesn't work on the ankle properly. They kept slipping off. They couldn't hold or secure the ankle properly.
2,the ankle ripper,"i have scoliosis so i thought i would get into the whole inversion thing, but this thing has me thinking about getting a inversion table. for one unless your crazy fit, or like me an average dude you will not be able to get yourself hooked up without assistance, by the way make sure you don't end up kicking your helper in the head with these things cause they hurt!!!!!! so as i was hanging upside down i began to immediately feel the euphoria and decompression in my spine, really. but the pain at my ankles also began to set in almost immediately. it literally felt as if my legs were going to rip at the ankles.ive read in order to have a good therapeutic inversion session you need to be hanging at least ten minutes, i only lasted about three, and then had to be immediately helped of, because as i said i could not at all unhook myself. but to be honest the relief i felt made me think maybe it just takes some getting used to, so i guess ill hang in there hahahahahahahah"
1,Poorly designed,I bought this looking at the reviews. But I see that this is very unsafe and poorly designed product.the holders are smooth and doesn't have enough angle so you can swing a little. Also after 2 minutes of use you will have ankle pain. I do not recommended this product at all.
1,hurts,"The boots hurt your ankles and upper feet like hell, kind of a torture...tried so many things but design is flawed, couldn't stand more than 2 minutes...not recommended."
2,Uncomfortable on the ankles,"I bought these to relieve pressure in some disks in my back as a result of my scoliosis.I was excited to get these, but ended up a disappointed.Because they are made out of metal, they do not give. What this means is that the edge puts a lot of pressure on the top part of your foot/ankle as you invert.To keep you foot from hurting too much you have to flex your foot, which is counterintuitive to inversion therapy. To properly relieve tension in your back your whole body needs to be relaxed and that is hard to do with these boots.Also, unless you are in a college dorm like I am and are limited by space, get an inversion table. I have one at home and I miss it quite a bit. If you are looking for inversion boots, look elsewhere.These are quality made and designed boots, but they are just too damn uncomfortable."
2,"OK, but not the best","I bought these hoping to be able to invert using me my pull up bar as a way to relieve stress. After putting them on, they felt very loose even with the foam pad installed that they provide. While hanging upside down, the pressure of my body pulling on my ankles caused blood circulation problems in my foot which I couldn't figure out a way around. I even wrapped t-shirts around my ankles so the boots would fit more securely but that didn't work as well. Maybe you will have better luck then I did if you decide to purchase these."
5,Monster on the Abs!,I had placed these on my chin up bar and I have been seeing very good results! I have been talking about my new piece of equipment a variety of folks!
5,Great product,"I am really pleased with these GIB2 Inversion Boots. They are everything that I was looking for in this type of boot. Right from the start, they worked as well as the original ones that came with my Inversion Table."
3,"Good price, tends to cut off circulation a bit.",The product is 1 size fits all - which i find to be a bit large for me. I find that it cuts off circulation when inverted - having said that - its not a barrier to use. Ok as a first inversion system.
1,Making paper airplanes for an hour would have been time better spent!,"Terrible 50 minutes! Nothing but a bunch of interviews, some very grainy film clips, and (WORST OF ALL) still pictures of the fights mentioned. NO ACTUAL FIGHT FOOTAGE AT ALL! Even though I rented this, I still feel strongly about not letting others waste time watching this junk."
1,not so tough,"Being a big tito ortiz and shamrock fan,this was a totall let down.basically there are to many interviews of other people and not enough good quality footage of the toughest men on this planet.big thumbs down."
1,Don't waste your time or hard earned money on this,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS. In this day and age where money and jobs are becoming less and less, you will get taken for the ride with this. No fight footage really, most of this is based upon Tito and Guy Metzger. I understand this is the set up for the Shamrock, Ortiz fued, but very little time is even spent on this, most of this doc is about the ""T Shirt"" that ortiz wore. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS."
3,My review!,"Not a bad DVD but i expected a wee bit more of a story, never the less for all UFC fans its a good one for the collection:)"
3,Extremely Hard,"I found the book very informative and has lots of great ideas but would be a better tool with the help of a counselor, I have BPD and couldn't begin to finish the book"
2,not what I needed,It was not what i needed. the speed I received it in and the condition of the book were just fine. Since it was not on the correct subject matter I will donate it to the public library.
4,The Angry Heart: Overcomcing Borderline and Addictive Disorders: An Interactive Self Help Guide,"I found this book hit every single nerve in my body. The content just resonated with truth. The content is clear, easy to understand and goes a long way towards enabling me to understand the complexities of this disorder."
4,The Regimen of Healing,"Personality disorders are a relatively new diagnostic area. The ICD-10 (the equivalent of the DSM-IV) doesn't even recognize some of them as separate disorders (e.g., the Narcissistic Personality Disorder). Others are controversial even in the USA (Borderline, Antisocial, Schizotypal). Textbooks are, therefore, of limited use to both practitioners and sufferers.Sorely needed are self-help books that guide the perplexed through a regimen of exercises and coping strategies, an interactive framework which rests on current knowledge, and an organizing principle to tie it all together. This book offers all three abundantly. It is bound to be of help to therapists, self-help groups, victims of the disorder, and their nearest and dearest. Sam Vaknin, author of ""Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited""."
2,Not impressed,Attempting to cover too much detail in a small book. Information was not in depth in each topic. Not enough information was delivered through reading this book on how to mend an Angry Heart. Was a waste of time reading it and buying it. Would never recommend it.
3,Not the best,I LOVE sesame sticks but these were not as crisp as I like. They also seemed a bit oily.
2,I have heard better,this is not the best from Earl King.I hoped for better R&B from him.I bought this cd on a whim and wish I would have left it alone.
3,Useful but limited.,"Interesting device, with which we were able to evaluate various glasses for UV protection, but ultimately disappointing:1) Did not seem to register in cold weather. Is there really so little UV from sun low in sky? Or is it non-functional when cold?2) Gives just a relative rating (1-5), not a value. The scientist in me would like a value.3) We contacted company with questions, but they never responded."
1,Why listen to them?,"Falwell distorts the Bible for his own political purposes. He is, in fact, a politician who uses religion to enlarge and control his constituency. Fasting may well shrink his corpulent midsection, but it has done nothing to make him understand what Christ was all about."
5,Very quick & very inexpensive,"""Little Sheba"" arrived in a couple of days, and was just as advertised.I wanted a copy that was used by actors in a production, and got it for practically nothing.The seller seems very conscientious. I would not hesitate to buy from him again."
2,"Good TV, Bad DVD",Received promply and installation was easy. Love the TV and radio but can't get the DVD to work.Was a refurbished set and no manual or hardware was included.Had to go to Audiovox and print manual and the hardware store to get nuts and bolts.
3,"Audiovox Ultra Slim 9"" LCD Dropdown TV","Purchased a refurbished unit through Amazon retailer. Package contents had obviously been removed and not re-packed very well. Never the less, it arrived in good condition. Installation was fairly simple and offered flexibility in depth and distance options for mounting under cabinet base. Picture quality is good from about 3-4 feet away. Up close the picture has a lot of ""noise"" and is not very sharp. Audio quality is decent. Radio reception is non-existent even with included AM antenna attached -FM dipole style antenna included has no jack or place to attach on back of unit. Tested a DVD to make sure it worked, but haven't watched an entire movie to comment further. Playback functions on remote appear adequate. Overall, for the price paid of $139.00 it performs as expected and serves it's purpose well...as an added TV in the kitchen to catch the game or watch the news."
4,Good Choice for a under the counter TV,A very good picture after some minor adjustments. The CD/DVD and radio all work well but you need some space for the external AM/FM antennas.The phone external speaker capability is a nice feature. The speakers are good but could be better for FM/CD.
2,shouda bought a sony,I should have spent the extra money and bought a Sony. On this Audiovox the picture on channel 4 skips. The speaker crackles. you get what you pay for
2,Picture gone after one year,Was thrilled with this TV mounted under a cabinet in the kitchen but after one year the picture started fading and is now totally gone. Was purchased through Beach Camera and they had no warranty. Referred me to Audiovox..no warrenty there either. Beach Camera offered me a 15% discount on a new one. Will not be buying anymore Audiovox products.
1,Not very good...2 units both broken,The picture quality was poor and the DVD player on the first unit didn't work. The second unit had black spots on the screen...I conclude that these units are pure junk. Don't waste your time or money. Liked the size.
5,"Mountain man, fur trader and keen observer","Charles Larpenteur's capabilities as a writer, his presence in the American wilderness at a time when many were not literate, his submersion in the fur trade in positions of responsibility, all make him a unique, worthy read.The reader is removed from the adventure fantasies and romance, carried into the day-to-day details of the life of a man who became a mountain man early in life and remained one until the trade was no longer a viable institution. A mountain man worrying about profit and loss far more than fights with wild tribesmen, a man who knows white men and studiously avoids being tricked or ruined by their wiles and their competition for trade with the Indians.Larpenteur has been used as a reference by almost every work written about the fur trade, but his own work needs no references.Read it."
2,Beware of exploding paint pens!,"My daughter received this kit for her birthday. It's a great idea and comes with lots of color options. However, the paint pens are of VERY low quality. They each have a plug in them to preserve the paint, but the plugs are the same color as the rest of the pen and very hard to see or remove. The pen part is a soft and thin plastic. This proves to be a very bad combination! When my daughter squeezed the pen the entire thing exploded in her face! :( She had blue paint in her eyes, mouth, hair, etc. and was horrified. Awful. My husband inspected another pen and had a hard time removing the plug. The slight pressure he had placed on the pen part caused the paint to squirt out all over him once he got the plug out. Ugh! We are artists and work with all sorts of paints. I've never seen this before, especially for a kid craft. I wouldn't recommend this product at all. If you do buy it, please be careful when preparing the pens for your child's use."
1,Continuity... Please?,There is absolutly nothing here that adds or works with the whole house of M world. Should of been titled: WHAT IF... House of End never Ended??
2,Be careful where you buy these.,"I have been using Ball #68100 wide-mouth, half-gallon Mason jars. They hold not only 2-quarts but even 2-liters and still allow airspace between the top of the contents and the rim or lid.I needed 1-quart jars so I ordered Ball #67000 wide-mouth 1-qt jars. I was surprised to find, when they arrived, that not only could they not hold one quart of liquid with airspace above but they only held 30oz when filled to the rim.I have since learned that ""Ball"" is a name licensed for use by multiple manufactures. The #67000 jars I purchased through Amazon were manufactured in the U.S.A. by Jarden and sold (through Amazon) by ""All American General Store"" which has since disappeared from Amazon's list of vendors. (All American General Store never did reply to my email complaint.)A Ball 1-quart, wide-mouth Mason jar which I later purchased from a well known local merchant did, in fact, hold 32oz."
5,Refinding an old hobby,"I just started canning again after many years. These canning jars were like the ones I used before but, for some reason, even better now!"
4,BPA Information,Eden Foods was one of the original companies to stop using BPA in it's cans. Before they used BPA vegetable resin enamel was used. Go to Edenfoods.com and search for BPA to read more about this.Article I was reading [...]BPA is called Badge in Europe and it is banned.We need to start using vegetable resin enamel for canning lids again and not BPA today.
2,Beware.. comes with two lids,I wanted to get single lid jar. I wish it had clearly mentioned that it has two lids. I had to return it.Also some lids on the jar were dented.
3,Cheaper at Kroger,Write after I received these I saw the same brand and size at Kroger for $13.99. Oh well next time I know where to go.Other than that they shipped fast and were quality Ball mason jars.
1,"not good, they crack.","bought them back around March. Out of 12 jars I have 6 left. They seem to have a week spot in the glass. The 6 that have cracked have done so in the same area, even the cracks follow the same path. I have off brand jars also, that have never cracked on me. These jars do not take the heat well for canning. I find the cracks on inspection when I pull them out of the hot water. Yes I know how to can, so this is not a user issue. After buying I also found this name brand and off brand jars in almost every store from hardware stores to discount stores for 1/2 the price of these. I also found that Ball plastic lids fit all glass jar brands (I use the plastic lids for my yogurt making). Ball does have a good product, just not this group of jars. I think I will stick to my Off Brand jars, that have lasted me for over 6+ years."
5,Wide Mouth Jar,I made pickles in the wide mouth jar and love them! They are really easy to use and helpful with putting lots of things in the jar.
1,Dont know because they were delivered broken,"Unfortunately i cannot give a good review because they were delivered broken. I had a few problems with receiving the deliver and the box finally came punctured and poorly re-taped (fed ex delivery). The packaging itself was not ruined, however the package had broken glass inside. Was immediately returned. Amazon did a great job responding to my request."
2,Jarden 67000 Ball 12 pack Wide Mouth 1 Quart Mason Jars,"Product arrived quickly, 2 jars were shattered. I contacted Amazon who said to contact the company direct. Company appologetic, would credit my account for the two jars but would not ship a replacement for them which I wanted. They were poorly packed. Would I order again, yes."
3,the Jars are great but,The price shipped is Double what I can get them for at Orchard supply or most else where.It may be good if you don;t want to leave the compound?
1,Pure dribble,"McKiernan's Iron Tower Trilogy was completely stolen and plagiarized from Tolkien, but the books are still decent a decent read albeit at a very childish level. The hero's always win and can leap tall buildings in a single bound.The Silver Call Duology, however, is just pure garbage. McKiernan is not a ""great"" writer to say the least. He writes at a very amateurish, childish level. He is horrible at character development. All his characters are completely scripted.These two books are a complete waste of time and not worth reading."
1,illegal...,"This is an illegal bootleg release. Buy 'The Complete Bob Marley & the Wailers 1967-1972', parts 2 and 3 (from JAD Records) or Bob Marley & The Wailers albums from Trojan Records instead, if you want to have the songs on this album. JAD's and Trojan's releases are legal, and the sound quality is often much better on their albums. Also, if you buy the box sets from JAD, part of the money will go to the Bob Marley and Peter Tosh families and Bunny Wailer (the three original Wailers)."
3,Not Enough Levels,"I purchased this game for my 5 year old son. The 4 levels that are in the game have incredible graphics and were very entertaining for my son to play. The problem is there are only 4 levels. After a day of playing this game my son became bored and has barely played it since because he has become so familiar with the situations in each level. You can change the level of difficulty in the game but that does not change the scenerios faced in each level. Once again, 4 great levels, but only 4 levels."
1,power rangers cd-rom,I ordered this on 12/6. It is now 12/28 and beyond promised delivery date. Where is it??????
2,Not Enough Levels,"I purchased this game for my 5 year old son. The graphics are incredible and my son enjoyed all 4 levels. But the problem is THERE ARE ONLY 4 LEVELS. After a day of playing and completing all 4 levels my son became bored and has barely played the game since. Because there are only 4 levels my child became so familar with the game and what was going to happen next he has no desire to play. You can change the difficulty of the levels but that does not change the situations in the levels. Once again, 4 great levels but only 4 levels."
3,Teaching mastery,"Like the Hurricane Havoc game, this is game is also very limited. However,if your 3-6 year old is just learning to master the computer, this game is a must have since he/she will be given instant kudos on a job well done; which is an important lesson for the young growing mind and he/she will be able to master this game on his/her own without a lot of parental input. If your child is more advanced, however, this game is not for you since your child will tire and be bored with this game easily."
5,meteor happiness,"My 3 year old son got this for a christmas present and he loves it. It doesn't take long to learn how to play, which is sometimes rare to find. The different levels of play come in handy when you notice that your child has almost mastered the game. This is one of his favorite things to play."
1,Way to easy --- gets boring quick!,My son is 3 and adores the rescue heroes. I thought he'd love to have this game. He quickly went through all of the levels and games and became so bored he doesn't play it anymore (after about 1 week) There are only 4 different areas to play and 3 levels for each area (all easy) if you beat all the areas you can print up a coloring page with your childs name on the top. Unless you can find it really cheap on sale - don't waste your money.
1,Poor customer support from Fisher Price ~ RESCUE HEREOS game,"Poor customer support from Fisher Price ~ RESCUE HEREOS METEOR MADNESS ~I have a brand new 1.3 Gig computer with Windows Me. The videos in the game only display 1/4 of the picture on the top of the screen. I have set the picture resulution to the correct setting and reinstalled the Quicktime 5 that came with the game. I have tried calling customer support at Fisher Price. After being on hold for about 10 minutes waiting for a support person to pick up the phone it then kicks into a recording where you can enter your name, phone number and why you are calling. I have left 2 messages and not once did any one there return my call. I have also tried calling multiple times but after being on hold the same recording clicks in. I am through wasting my time and will be returning this game back to Amazon.com"
1,Why did they go and change it?!,"The best version was Print Artist Gold 4.0, the layout was perfect, the graphics were unbeatable and the program was just about the most user-friendly piece of software I have ever used! Why did they have to change it?! The old version does not work on my new fancy computer. This version really sucked compared to that one! And if u didn't know, now u know."
1,2 thumbs down,I agree with D. J. Reed. Print Artist Gold 4.0 was so much better. What happened to all the really good clipart? This version stinks.
1,Quality control seems to be a problem.,"One of the key support components proved to be drilled at the wrong angle, making it impossible to tighten all bolts. Also, craftsmanship is very shoddy... tube end fittings expose torn metal edges, bolt housing welds are shoddy.Your mileage may vary: you might get a good one, you might be able to muscle it together, you might not break your neck.Good luck with that. I, for one, prefer not to hang from a device that appears to have been thrown together by sullen and disinterested vandals. I will be returning this item."
4,good product,"ok the product works perfect although it could use some kind of grip cushion . its easy to set up all you need is a power drill and a drill bit or stainless steel screws. no exercise examples of any kind so thats a negative as well but you can always search the net for chinning bar exercises.overall glad i bought this product , recommend it if your looking for a product like this."
5,Great bar,"Been looking for a doorway bar but didn't want the typical one that have the multiple grips and generally they hang lower in the doorway. This product fit the bill. There was one picky thing where the screws to the brackets were panhead but the holes in the brackets were countersunk holes. No issue though. Otherwise when it was installed it feels like a chin-up bar should feel like, just a straight bar, was worried about if feeling flimsy, but once up on the door it feels solid. Plenty high enough to do a full hanging chin up, at least for me at 5'9"". Just feels good to hang from a straight bar, can't work through the door without knocking out 1 or 2 chin-ups:) Definitely would recommend."
4,A Good Product,"We purchased the ViewSonic 17"" LCD Monitor because it was one of two brands recommended to us as providing good quality for the money. My husband uses it, and he is quite happy with it. The colors are nice; it is clear with a reasonably sharp picture. It takes very little space on the desk and has some tilt to it. The 17"" picture is significantly better than the 12"" screen on the monitor that sold with his Dell computer. There was very little effort involved in installation. We got a better deal buying it from Amazon than we could get from any local store, it shipped quickly, and we got a good quality product."
4,a FAIR LCD Monitor ... better than others in the market,"I was happy with my ViewSonic VP191b monitor. My wife's Envision monitor died and she needed a new one but she was ok with getting the smaller screen (17 instead of 19). So far is a good monitor better than Envision and also better than the Gateway monitor that originally came with my pc that also broke down several month ago.The price was good, you can get cheaper but ..."
1,Not The Usual Pleasant Smell,"Not pleased at all with this purchase! Normally this perfume smells incredible on my wife -- for whatever reason this particular batch smells like a bug spray; therefore, my wife no longer will use it. This is our first time purchasing perfume via the internet and it will be our last time."
5,Espectacular,"212 by Carolina Herrera es el mejor perfume del mundo, no hubo ningún inconveniente con el envío, excelente vendedor y excelente producto."
4,"Run after this CD NOW, unless you have scissors.","I taught these kids in Stafford and then someone told me I should see them play. For a hot, steamy local venue held at a Middle School gym ... well thay made it kick. I bought their 1st CD (which also rawks)on the spot and asked when I could see them play again (although, as a teacher, I am normally a bit tight fisted with the dinero).This disc turns a band with a good CD into a potential legacy. Run to get this CD NOW, unless, like I said you have scissors; then walk fast or better, toss them and start running."
4,Just what I wanted,"Looked around and took a chance. Lucky me, this was exactly what I needed.Suggestion: Before you buy, Ask yourself what you need to accomplish, what level of knowledge do you possess about the art, how detailed do you want the art to be, how are you with reading directions.ME: Want to scrimshaw bone, nothing fancy *Very little knowledge *Details could be important *Not good with reading direction. Would rather experiment hands on looking at photos as guide. *This book was just the right fit, and has plenty of direction for advanced artwork.Hope this helps."
3,scrimshaw: complete illustrated manual,book was ok . had more a bout history. just so so on projects. buy other books with it!
2,"good idea, poor design","This could have been a great product. The idea of using a mouse as a pen is good, but it does have a lot of problems, some with the design.It is too small.The buttons should be in the side, not in the front. It is not a natural position. clicking does not feel natural, it puts strain on your fingers.My finger is normal size, but it sits right in between the scroll wheel and both buttons. It is weird. I usually end up clicking the right-click button. Also, I can't rest my finger anywhere. The space is too small. There should be a rest for your index finger between the scroll wheel and the buttons.This works a little better if I swith my computer to a left-handed mouse, that way I use the top button as the main mouse clicker. Still, then I hate to switch things back when I want to rest and go back to my original mouse (this is too clumsy for 8 hours a day use)."
3,"OK, wheel way too hard to use.","I like the semi-stylus style of mousing. I hold it very loosely and work it like a pen that balances itself. Placement of left button fine, right button only OK. Placement of the wheel makes it hard to reach, and it is way, way to hard to turn. Better placement of the wheel and a weighted wheel a'la Logitech makes more sense. This mouse definitely has a different posture, tho, and may help those with RSI."
2,Tiny,"It is not recommended for the purpose stated, i.e. carpel tunnel syndrome. Tiny and very difficult to use."
3,well........,"This book was a good read, and it was very though provoking. However, so many things in this book were so unbelievable! There is so much here that I want to be true, that it may be too good to be true....it is unfortunate that if these events were real that The PK man didn't work harder for the good of all people...."
4,Medically necessary,"This formula was recommended by our pediatric surgeon to prevent constipation. My daughter has transitioned from breast milk to the formula at 9 months and is doing well. She does seem to get more reflux with the formula, but otherwise tolerates it well. If you will be transitioning to this from breast milk, I advise that you gradually add it in - it takes some getting used to."
5,LOVE IT!,"My 2 year old son loves Chuggingtons. We are working on getting him all of the movies. I like them because they have great lesson on friendship, teamwork and beleaveing in yourself."
2,A throwaway item,"My dentist highly recommended this toothbrush to massage my gums. It took some getting used to because of the high-speed vibrations that tickle the gums. My teeth felt smooth after use, just like getting a cleaning at the dentist's office.I set it aside after a year or two. Recently I decided to use it again after several years. It would not take a charge. I decided the batteries might need replacement and found a site on the Internet that explained how to dismantle the unit and replace the batteries. This unit is not designed for home or factory service. The parts and the batteries are anchored in epoxy at the factory. Considering that nickel-cadmium batteries last less than four or five years, this unit is fairly expensive , especially at the price I paid.Changing the batteries is a time consuming effort. Even after finishing the job, the toothbrush will not work. It is an expensive throwaway."
3,"Good book, but lots of mistakes","The book does a good job of introducing the concepts; good explanations and proper coverage of all material. However, some equations in this book are incorrect (mild typos) and answers provided in the back cannot be depended on (we can even figure out, sometimes, what the person writing the solution did wrong). Still, our teacher did enjoy giving us these problems to see if we'd notice."
2,Hopefully the next edition of this book will be better,There are several mistakes in the book. Also the solutions for problems printed in the back of the book are incorrect. There are several typos.
5,Can Find It Cheaper,I have no problems with this item at all except I know of about 15 different places I could have bought this for a lot cheaper. I only purchased it here because I had two amazon.com $25 coupons I had to use by a certain date.
5,A thoughtful retrospective,This video offers a touching look at the Goddess as She has been worshipped since ancient times into the present. It is a must see for anyone who wants to know what Goddess worship is about from an objective perspective. Perhaps one of the best parts of this video is that some of the great teachers in modern Paganism are interviewed (ex: Starhawk).
2,too moody for its own good,"Peter Straub is often referred to as one of the top horror writers this side of SK, so I was certainly expecting more than this breakfast biscuit of a ghost story. A teenage boy has disappeared in a house with a dastardly history. His uncle comes for the funeral of his sister in law, the boys mother who has killed herself, and begins a search. Straub manages to encompass ghosts, pedophilia, serial killers, a haunted house, creepy visions, and a gratuitous Magnetic Fields reference. This book isnt very scary at all and the characters are too shallow to register with us emotionally. Mark, the boy, is a cluster of teen cliches. Finally Mark is living happily with Patrick Swayze in some happy otherworld, so everythings OK! Much too New Agey, and very repepitive due to shifting points of view..."
3,LOST ME,"ONE can never deny Straub's command of language; his keen awareness of characterizations; his deft hand in getting inside Mark and Jimbo's heads; his mood. While this is one of his better books of recent years, my main problem with it was its lack of originality, or should I say it's predictability. Did you ever doubt that Mark would end up with Lily? Did you ever doubt that Ronnie would be caught? The ending is new-age mysticism and doesn't really satisfy my idea of closure. Tom Passmore's character is wasted and Tim Underhill's is too narrative in substance. Phil Underhill is completely unlikeable and I just never felt thrilled. I wish I could say it's a classic like fellow reviewers but for me, it was a moderately entertaining spook story."
3,"Good, But Slim","This is an excellent tale. The only reasons I gave it a ""3"", instead of the ""4"" that the contents deserve, are a) its weak conclusion: and b)it's mighty SLIM, for $34 (Canadian funds) - I expect more ""meat"" from Straub."
2,Another fan of Straub's Blue Rose and Tim Underhill,"Good idea, lots of potential but it reads like an outline, a first draft. It was like eating chinese food. Needed a little more depth. The story needed a strong or stronger bond between Underhill and the boy Mark to of made it work."
5,Straub does it again. Not a wasted word.,"There are certain writers I always look forward to their next work. Mr. Straub has never disappointed me. This novel is much shorter then his pass efforts but this is due to the fact that it was exceptionally edited where not one word is wasted. The way the story shift viewpoints from character to character using both first and third person perspectives is very well done. The story line move shiftly and the conclusion ties up all the loose ends, as well as leaving us a little unsure of Mark Underhill's fate."
3,"Lost Boy, Lost Girl","You have to like Straub's Timothy Underhill to enjoy this book. I am not a fan of the supernatural aspect, but love Straub's writing."
3,OK but not brill,"I like Straub's books but this one was a bit average from him. The story wasn't as creepy as Ghost Story and the story seemed to drift from one event to another without a real climax. I couldn't connect or sympathise too much with the characters either, for instance I wasn't too convinced about the boy's grief over his mother's death. I like Straub's writing style, hence, 'OK'."
3,"Lost Boy, Lost Girl, Lost Momentum","Having read ""Ghost Story"" and ""The Throat"", I was delighted when I saw that Mr. Straub had published a new book. ""The Throat"" was one of my favorite books ever, and when I found Tim Underhill and Tom Pasmore were in this new book, I was even more thrilled. What I found was a story, while on one level, fascinating, was, on the other hand, a bit disappointing. No one can argue Mr. Straub's ability to write with amazing dialogue. What I missed the most was his ability to scare me. Not a typical reader of horror novels, I liked the author's two previous books in the sense that he wrote an intelligent horror story. This book lacked in that sense."
2,The writing Style turned me off,"I loved the story itself & thought it was a good scary ghost story/mystery. However, I could not stand the writing style! It was full of redundant dialog - I was basically reading the same thing over & over.I also thought the ending was a bit cheezy...This was the 1st bk. I've read by Straub & if the others are written the same way I'll pass."
2,Strange,"very strange, is Mark dead or alive, that I can't answer, perhaps you can after reading this book."
3,"Not His Best, But Still Engaging","Peter Straub is an outstanding writer. He simply can't write a bad book. He doesn't have it in him. However, like the rest of us mortals, I think sometimes he just gets tired, and can't rise to the level of master of horror that he nearly always obtains. A book like ""Lost Boy, Lost Girl"" is the result of Peter Straub on an off day. It's a good book; but not excellent like ""Koko"" or ""Floating Dragon"".The plot jumps a bit -- some things are not explained as well as they should be. Again, we have a ""haunted"" house; I wish sometimes he would move beyond this metaphor. We have a few character types that we have seen before as well; for example, here in this book we have another ""Davey"".Yet this book is still a million times better than most of the other horror novels on the shelf these days. Read it, but don't expect TOO much. It's very light."
2,Not as creepy as advertised..,"While this book brought together several different elements found in thrillers and horror novels (like haunted houses, serial killers, and ghosts), it managed to be neither scary nor exciting. It felt disorganized, despite its simple writing, and the plot felt rather unresolved by the book's end. There were simply too many gaps in the storyline for this to be truly an enjoyable read. It was very ""different,"" and while the characters were not detestable, they weren't very dynamic or particularly sympathetic, either. I have heard Straub compared to Stephen King, and based on this book alone, I don't really see a basis for the comparison."
3,At least it was shorter than his usual!,"The last book I read by Straub that I really liked was FLOATING DRAGON--but even that ended sort of dumb. Like King, Straub never knows how to end his books. I tried KOKO, MYSTERY and THE THROAT but ended up skimming or not finishing them. Tried again with HELLFIRE CLUB--skimmed it. Too long and ""knowing"" the endings would be poor, I gave up.But this book was short, and I was able to finish it in a couple days. By short, I mean it also kept Straub from going on and on and on and the poor ending isn't ""that bad"" and I DID finish the book -- no skimming!But I'd wait until it's in paperback."
2,Not Straub's best,"A fan of Straub's Blue Rose Trilogy, I was eager to read about Tim Underhill's further exploits in Millhaven. In this case, I was disappointed. lost boy lost girl has many intriguing elements, and was at times truly scary, but the ending utterly failed to satisfy me. I felt like Straub copped to a supernatural ending when, in the past, he has kept Millhaven firmly rooted in the nightmarishly real. I never minded that his books were so long; if Mr. Straub could have come up with a tighter ending that did not shatter my willing suspension of disbelief, I'd gladly have read 100+ more pages."
3,I agree,"I just finished reading lost boy lost girl, yes I admit that i couldnt put the book down. but the ending didnt do it for me. I didn't think it satisfied me. The begininng had great detail, maybe way to much, but come on whats with that ending? no one finds Mark's body and we dont even know how he dies. And whats with the serial killer. not much is mentioned about this men, till the end of the story. and come on lily 19 falling in love with a 15yr old. yeah right. what kind of ghost is this. the kid is barely reaching puberty. besides that it scared me."
3,He's not Stephen King,"Mr. Straub does an adequate job at creating a mystery. However, he doesn't create the spell at which Stephen King excels.As a mystery story, it's a good paperback. As a two-layer story that some reviewers indicated, Mr. Straub doesn't cut it.No need to reiterate the plot. At some point, he forgets Phil's wife, expecting the reader to read between the lines that aren't there.Better luck next time, Mr. Straub."
2,not worth the time!,I usually like a good Peter Straub read but found this to be a pathetic read from him. Slow and boring and not worth the time to read .
2,The first book I read by Peter Straub,"This was the first book I've read by Peter Straub and by guessing from the general rating of some of his other books they don't get better. The only reason I even tried Straub was because he collaborated with Stephen King who is a great author. Although if this is any indication of how he writes then I will never bother to pick up another one of his books. I usually finish the books I start, but I had to drop this one."
4,"A Solid, Scary Tale","While not quite as good as the books that make up the ""Blue Rose"" trilogy (""Koko"", ""Mystery"", and especially ""The Throat"") ""lost boy lost girl"" is still a solid read from Mr. Straub. I felt the book was not quite up to his earlier efforts, and felt a little unfinished at its conclusion (perhaps that was intentional-considering how much ""In the Night Room"" has in common with this tale) but still well worth a look."
4,Great Read,"This book had all the ingrediants for a great read. Horror, suspense,and love. When I first opened the book, I thought O.K. I am only going to be able to read the first chapter, and be able to put it down pretty easy. But to my surprise I was wrong. As I read on I felt like I was being pulled into the small town of Millhaven. It felt like I was a visitor going to each location and actually watching the whole thing play out in front of me. Most books do not grab my attention like that. So, I do consider this book an awesome find. It was definately one of those books that you just can't put down. Which led to many late nights. I can't wait to read more of Peter Straub's books."
3,"good book, but not worth the time","This is the first Peter Straub book I have read, and I must say the way it started I was excited that it was going to be a really good book, and the more I read, the more I liked it. Although, all good things must come to an end, and an abrubt end it did! I found the ending of the book to be anti-climatic, I was expecting much more to come out of the story, and more detail would have been nice too. The ending was too unbelievable and too vague to even make it worth while."
3,I liked it,It was pretty spookie. Alittle disapointing at the end but I liked it. I just lent it to my sister to read without her asking. If that says anything.
1,lost boy lost girl... I hope they never find them >:(,just read luv2read's review LOL she/he took the words out of my mouth!!!
3,straub book review,Anything written by Peter Straub is bound to be excellent! I haven't yet read this story...but as I am very familiar with Straub's writing style..I'm looking quite forward to it!!!!
1,Most boring horror novel of the year,"HiI have never read a book by peter straub before and i won't again.....full of redundent dialoge that keeps appearing over and over...Stephen King said ""may be straubs best...work. hack and former writing pal to another....a real snoozer and highly un-original....we got the hero..his cold fish of a brother....a crotchety old neighbor(a homosexual for political correctness.)..This guy and Stephen King could be twins as far as bad writing goes....kind of book you rush through the last 100 pages to read just to get the damn thing finished...I can't keep count of the numerous conversational repeats..bury this turkey"
1,No TTS Boycott non tts books on amazon,I accidentally downloaded this without checking to see if the TTS (text to speech) functionality was enabled. I put it on my kindle got in my car and no TTS! I have resolved to not only boycott non TTS books on amazon but to also boycott all Amazon ebooks until all Amazon ebooks are TTS enabled. Shame on Amazon for caving on this issue. It is however possible to put ebooks on the kindle that do not come from amazon and thats what I intend to do from now on. Sorry Amazon but you screwed up on this one!
3,Still not the old Peter Straub,"While Lost Boy Lost Girl contains some flashbacks to Ghost Story and ShadowLand, it fails to develop to anything like the sustained complexity of Peter Straub's early books.Its far too short, it contains too many anomalies (first a terrifying 6 year old phantom girl, then a loving 19 year old teenager, why did the mother really kill herself ?). Frankly, I didn't find much mystery, terror or horror - pity, the idea was good but the execution was lacking - another few months of effort and the writer might have come up with something really good."
5,A new horror classic,"For sheer atmospheric horror, ""Lost Boy, Lost Girl"" rivals Straub's original classic, ""Ghost Story."" Haunted houses are a perennial favorite and this one has it all: a dizzying warren of secret passages that lead from room to room, the ghost of a murdered young girl, and a Procrustean ""giant"" bed used by a psychotic killer to torture his own daughter. Recommended for readers of horror who prefer a subtle, insidious, and thorough scare."
2,Not pleased,"Within the initial few pages of the book it showed promise but did not deliver. Towards the end the twist was weak, uninteresting and didn't seem to relate well to the story whatsoever. The only good thing about the book is the website. If you choose to read this book, make sure you see the site afterwards."
3,Lost Boy Lost G--,"I bought this book because of the blurb on the cover, the one where Stephen King says that the book ""may be Straub's best work yet."" IF that's true then I won't be reading any other Straub books, because this one does not have an ending.THe book starts overall well, it's scary and the story is building, but instead of a great, scary, satisfying ending, it just STOPS. The mystery is not solved, and there are gaping logical flaws that were never explained. Totally unsatisfying.Straub, where's the rest of the book! You owe me a dollar, for the portion of the book you neglected to write."
2,Writing Style,"I did not really enjoy his writing style, something was missing for me. Another problem for me was that the book was all over the place. I was busy trying to figure out where I was, what did I miss and where was he headed, he jumped all over the place. The ending wasn't that great either.I'm going to try Ghost Story, hopefully I will enjoy that more. If not, I don't think I will read anything else by this author."
2,Not My Fave By Him,"I have read many of Peter Straub's other books,Ghost Story, Mr. X, The Hellfire Club to name a few. I am used to his convoluted and complex plots. On many occassins I have to go back and re-read passages to recognize what is going on in the story. Usually this focus is rewarded with an OMIGOSH ending. This one was more of a HUH?. I ordered this used one from Amazon while on a cruise ship. I bought it first @ Borders to read on the boat, I left it on my deck chair and someone took it. I was desparate to find out how the story ended so i got online while on the ship and ordered it so that it would be waiting for me when i got home from my trip. Had I known how it ended the person who stole it from me could have just asked me for it."
4,Lost boy Lost girl,I just finished this book and i have to say its been a very long time since i have enjoyed a book so much.
2,Childish story,"I have always considered Peter Straub one of the most intelligent horror writers of today. However, Lost boy, lost girl reads like a juvenile tale. Scary? Horrific? Boring, boring, boring. I cannot believe this book is a product of Straub's pen. Enough to say I found Jimbo the most interesting person of the story. Yawn!!"
2,quite overrated,"Well, I finished it. That's saying something I guess, but what a waste of time. It's one of those books that had a lot of nice reviews by an author who is well respected. I used to read Straub's early works but stopped reading him about the same time I stopped reading Stephen King. I kept expecting the book to go somewhere. The protaginist Tim Underhill held little interest to me. The e-mails from beyond were an extremely silly gimmick. I kept expecting to like the book more to be scared excited or something, but in the end I was just bored. I read the paperback, but did not even bother to read the first ten pages of the next Straub/ Underhill novel that they tend to put at the end of popular writers paperback editions. (I peeked it had those silly e-mails again.) It'll be awhile before I give Straub another chance."
2,I don't get the ending,"I thought it started off great, but I was very disappointed with the end. I don't get what happened? I don't know if that is what Mr. Straub was going for, but it seemed incomplete to me. Was Mark killed by a serial killer or did he run off with some ghost-girl? I actually came to the review section to see if anyone else was a ""lost boy or a lost girl"" ... I know I am!"
4,Tight and quick. I couldn't put it down!,"This was my first Peter Straub book, and I loved it. It gave me the creeps while providing a feeling of quality literature. The characters were genuine in their behaviors and I ended up caring a great deal about Mark Underhill and the situations he endures. I found myself hoping for young Mark to find a decent resolution to the death of his mother (and other family secrets). You can tell that Straub cares for his characters quite a bit as well.Call it Horror, Mystery, or whatever. But LOST BOY LOST GIRL is so much more."
3,Entertaining,Typical Temperance Brennan novel. Good for a bus commute read or vacation read when your brain needs a literary break. Still stimulating and entertaining.
3,Details to Get Lost In,"Fatal Voyage is a suspenseful plot but it takes a long time to get to the point and then to the conclusion. There is more forensic detail than story line. All the agencies with all the initials arrive on the scene of an air crash and nothing fits together. I'm in the minority, but it was not a book I ""couldn't put down."" My advice is to skip this one in spite of great reviews."
5,"I'm ready for the next one, Ms. Reichs!","After plowing through this book, I've decided it's my new favorite Tempe Brennan adventure. (Death Du Jour was my prevoius favorite.) The detail on the crash investigation was very interesting and added to the overall effect of the story. Kathy Reichs explains the science used by her characters, rather than just making a general statement like ""she looked into it."" The reader gains an understanding of what really goes on in police/forensic investigations.After his virtual absence in Deadly Decisions, Ryan is back in full wisecracking force. While I spent most of the book wishing Tempe would just stop her dancing around and make some sort of decision about him, she seems to lean toward that in the end, but I've taken that bait before. So, when does the next book come out?"
4,detail unmatched but story takes time,"The medical and historic detail of this writer is excellent, however, the story seems to drag on initially. The pace picks up in the second have of the book, and is worth giving a try. Some of the important details come out of non important characters who seem to be placed briefly in the story only to quickly insert these facts. The ending seems to come very quickly and some events need to be explained in the last few chapters. I like fast paced thrillers and this doesnt quite get there, but the detail is great if your into it. I wish I could give a 3.5 star review."
4,Fatal Voyage,"I have really enjoyed the series of books from Kathy Reichs. The contents of Fatel Voyage are good, and the facts are accurate. The story is quite meaty, although I do feel you have to read the series in order to truley understand all the contents. I found this book easy to read, and throughly enjoyable. I was however a little disapointed with the ending, but maybe that was due to the fact that I did not want it to end! A great read... enjoy!"
5,Tempe Brennan and Andy Ryan solve a strange case,"Tempe Brennan is called in to a plane crash in NC. Andy Ryan is there because his partner was escorting a prisoner back to Canada. They save a foot from coyotes, only to find that the foot doesn't belong to anyone on the flight's passenger list. As Tempe works on the identification, she finds that she is suddenly persona non grata at the crash site. Apparently the person who wants her off the site is none other that the Lieutenant Governor Dashwood. Why?This is the best yet of Reichs' books. They seem to get better and better. I read it in one sitting, I was sleepy the next day at work, but I just couldn't put it down!"
5,Real Page Turner,"Talk about realism - This is a book about a Forensic Anthropologist in North Carolina written by a Forensic Anthropologist from North Carolina. I found the book to be a real page-turner and very well written and plotted. If you like Patricia Cornwell, you'll love this one!Highly recommended."
3,"Pretty good story, though not her best",I don't think this was her best book but it was a pretty good tale. Kathy needs to do less lecturing to the reader in her lengthy explanations. I find myself skipping these paragraphs to get on with the relevant story line.
3,Just OK!,"This is the first book I've read by Kathy Reichs. Having read all the favorable reviews...prior to reading Fatal Voyage, I was really looking forward to an exciting, suspenseful story. While the plot starts off strong and, for the most part, held my interest, I was expecting much more. I'd describe the suspense tepid, the characters only moderately interesting and the climax just mildly satisfying. Overall, by the time I approached the final quarter of Fatal Voyage, I was more interested in finishing the book than caring a lot about how it ended. Overall, Fatal Voyage is not a bad book -- it's just average. I will read another Reichs book but not in the near future."
3,Reichs is improving.,"Someone has finally explained to Kathy Reichs that a mystery novel is generally focused on people rather than on social issues. Instead of the sledgehammer approach in her other books (cults are bad, biker gangs are bad) we finally get a novel with some plotting to back up her (admittedly fascinating) forensic details. The plot is still too Cornwall, and the coincidences stretch the point until it breaks, but this was a reasonably interesting effort."
3,entertaining and twisted,Was a easy read with many story lines to keep you interested. has many interesting facts which i enjoy. each book has a different story while moving the characters story line moving foward
5,Watch out Patricia Cornwell,"After being a big fan of Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series, I burned out on the last couple due to poor writing and what appeared to be an urgency to complete the books. This means the books were boring and cut off before there was any closure. When the tv show ""Bones"" came out, I began watching and have loved it. So I picked up Kathy Reich's first book about Temperence Brennan. I have read every one of her books and have enjoyed each one as much as the others. I believe she has what it takes to keep the stories going, keep a reader interested, and will have you looking forward to the next book."
5,Reichs is an Excellent Author,I have enjoyed every book I have read by Kathy Reichs. Her stories are simular to the first books that Patricia Cornwell wrote.
4,Wealth of Details...,"If you are into medical examiner orented fiction then ""Fatal Voyage"" by Kathy Reich is the book for you.Ms. Reich provides her loyal fans with a wealth of detail in her newest forensic thriller.The characters are well-developed, the dialogue believable, and the plot intriguing. All key elements in the making of this most entertaining story.John SavoySavoy InternationalMotion Pictures Inc"
2,Disappointing,"As an avid reader of Ms. Reichs' genre, I immediatly snapped this one up. The book started out well but I started imaginingthe author sweating under a deadline fairly soon thereafter. Then on page 349, the author, after realizing how unbelievable the plot is, decides to lend credibility by associating these baaaaaad folks with the Republican Party. I'm interested in the talent you showed in your previous books, Ms. Reichs, not your politics."
4,Great summer read!,"This is one in a series of forensic thrillers featuring Kathy Reichs' character, Dr. Temperance Brennan, a forensic anthropologist. Her characteer development is very good as is the plot. Keeps you guessing. Not a challenging read but a fun entertaining summer read. Make sure when you pick this one up that you have time to read the whole book because you won't want to put it down."
3,Unusual,"The first 300 or so pages do not really offer action or a plausible plot. The readers interest is mainly centred on who wants to destroy Tempe and what may be wrong with this foot. But the author takes her time until we see any considerable progress. But then there is recompense. Suddenly the story gets faster and faster until it reaches a breathtaking climax. The last part makes the book a very good read, I admit. Whereas Tempe is very believable as a character, the baddies are not very conceivable, their motivation on the borderline of becoming ludicrous. But the metamorphosis from a mystery to a genuine horror story gives the novel some exciting elements. Unusual but interesting!"
4,A little less detail and a little more romance please Kathy!,"I really liked this book. Although heavy on the foresic detail, it kept my attention and kept me guessing to the end. Unlike Cornwells later novels, it still focuses a lot of the forensic science which is good.HOWEVER, and I hope Kathy is listening, GIVE US MORE ANDREW RYAN!!!! He made short and unsatisfying appearances in this book. I kept waiting for them to have it out regarding his disappearance from her life in the LAST novel but they didn't.Kathy Reichs gave me hope though at the end implying in the next novel there will be a romance. These characters are so good together, I hope that is the case.-Mostly satisfied reader from California"
3,Fatal Voyage a fun read,"Fatal Voyage got my attention..hard to put down! The situation, the characters, the locale, and the dog made this one of Kathy's better books! I've shared it with many friends!"
5,Fatal Voyage by Kathy Reichs reviewed by Stephen,Temperance Brennan gets a call to go check out a crash site. she goes there and finds out a mysterious foot that didn't belong to anyone at the crash. But before she can find out where the foot is from she gets kicked off the demort team. But she comes back and she finds out about bones in the wall of a lodge cabin. She finally gets a warrant and gets a chance to search the lodge cabin. There were very weird things in this cabin that nobody could describe. If you want to learn more about this book go out and read it on your own. This book gets much more action packed and has a very twisted ending. Kathy Reichs truly did a great job on this book. I would reccomend it to anyone.
3,Not as Good as her Others,"I usually love Kathy Reich's books, and Tempe Brennan, but this one doesn't rate the same as the others. I really liked certain parts of the book, but the majority of it seemed disjointed and unbelievable. It almost seemed that Ms. Reichs was out to shock us more than entertain us. Even the forensics wasn't as thorough, but I did enjoy reading how major disasters are recreated and the cause determined. I loved Boyd, and found him a great addition to the storyline. I hope we'll seem more of him. I just hope that Ms. Reichs takes a less unbelievable crime this time."
3,All About The Southside,"There are too many underground rappers from the south to have some of these artist to have two songs on this disc, for starters. Fat Pat is batting 1000 with his two songs, and TRU is batting .500 with ""I'm Bout It, Bout It"". Three 6 Mafia, C-Loc, Kingpin Skinny Pimp, Lil' Keke and Eightball & MJG all delivered on time with this. Most of these songs were in heavy rotation and held it down for the southern states. My mistake is I got the edited version instead."
5,"Simple, soft, clear, and warm --- like the perfect Christmas","Loreena McKennitt, from Stratford, Ontario, Canada, has built an international reputation for her delightful voice and harp accompaniment. While more recent recordings venture farther afield and incorporate influences from India and elsewhere, this album stays mainly grounded in its Celtic roots. McKennitt's clear voice soars over traditional favourites and less-known pieces as well. Especially delightful is her duet with Canadian actor/singer Cedric Smith on The King --- her pure tone contrasts with and still melts into his rougher voice with some marvellous harmonies. Also worth hearing is Snow, McKennitt's own setting of a poem by Archibald Lampman, one of Canada's earliest poets."
4,Really good CD,I received this as a gift and was pleeasantly surprised by it! It was very good. The vocals were outstanding.
2,Drive potensial fans away!,"I was less than impressed with this album. The music lacks harmony and coherence, the lyrics rarely matched the melody, and to top it all, she just didn't sing th songs with her usual passion. I really loved ""The Visit"" and ""Book of secrets"", but this album came close to putting me off Loreena forever! A great pity. For die-hard McKennit fans only."
3,"""Drive the Winter Away"" ???","Sorry, haven't listened, but the title makes this sound more like a Candlemas or Imbolc album."
5,Magnificent!,"Easily one of the best Christmas albums available, this music celebrates the pensive side of the winter season to glorious effects. If you like either Loreena, or Christmas music, this one is a must."
2,Not one of my McKennitt favorites,"I have several of McKennitt's CD's. I Love her voice and very much enjoy her music and style... EXCEPT when she fails to ""liven up"" a CD with several of the more rousing, up-beat tempo songs/selections she can do so well. When song after song is slow and plodding, it makes for a very boring CD, and a bit of a 'downer' for the mood. Personally, I think her all-time best efforts are: Mask and Mirror, The Visit and Book of Secrets."
5,wonderful,"This is an amazing CD. It is very sparse yet beautiful and seems to capture the mood of a winter's evening perfectly. Loreena's voice and musical offerings through the years have increased in complexity and multi-cultured flavorings.....a wonderful evolution for a deep artist. But on returning to this album you get a very stripped down Loreena, lotsa tracks with just her and maybe 1 or 2 instruments while she sings very old Christmas/Solstice songs.....Strangely, this is not only my favorite Christmas/Solstice CD but also my favorite album by her in general. It just,,,,,speaks to anyone who has spent Christmas/Solstice in the quiet countryside and witnessed the true miracle of the season....the stillness and beauty of winter in the country."
5,Lose the stresses of the day with this lovely captivating CD,"This captivating CD mesmerizes the mind and soul from the moment one hears the first sounds of the first song, ""In Praise of Christmas"" to the ringing of the bells in the last song on the CD, ""Let All That Are To Mirth Inclined.""As a lyric soprano, I am often highly critical of most soloists, but Loreena McKennitt has earned high praises for her lovely lilting voice that seems to echo though the recesses of the mind and refreshes your very being to the core. What a way to escape without leaving your home and what a way to go back in time!This music makes me feel as though I am visiting my Scottish ancestors and sharing the lovely music of their time. Don't wait until Christmas to hear this one."
5,Fall and winter...,"A beautiful chrsitmas album, not only for christmas, for everyday you want. Loreena McKennitt, her marvelous voice and the acoustic tunes in churches and monasteries of Ireland and Canada make this album a wonderful piece. I'm a very big fan of Loreena and this is one of her best albums. Also this version includes the DVD ""No Journey's End"". Classics like ""To Drive the cold winter away (in this album is called In Praise Of Christmas)"", from Ireland ""The Wexford Carol"", an early version of ""Snow"" and my favorite: ""Balulalow"". Beautiful album, angelical voice!"
5,"Transcendent, Ethereal, & Haunting","This album reminds me of everything good in life. 'Day's End' begins and ends in a circular path of swaying melodies as Steve Sosa delivers a story through the guitar. Perfectly placed sustaining rhythms and echoes give depth to this art. It's amazing that one person can create such a sound while playing solo acoustic guitar! The cello accompaniment on 'Peace' (track 6) is lovely. The CD plays in my car on rainy, nostalgic days and anytime I want to feel serene. I enjoy playing the CD at work. People who come into my office when it's playing are always remarking at the beautiful music. I have also been know to allow it to lull me to sleep. The nature sounds at the end of the 'Peace Reprise' are the perfect send off; like quiet moments in the country - Springtime at dusk. When is Steve Sosa putting out another CD? I recommend buying this one first. Never before has a debut been so crisp and captivating."
5,Hands down one of the best releases of 2005!,"I can't describe how much I love this CD! It is just non-stop entertainment from start to finish. You can let it play all the way through and not feel the urge to skip anything. The way the skits and interludes are intertwined throughout the songs is comedy genius. The production & sound quality on this CD is astounding. Majik Most is a true entertainer and it really shows through on amazing tracks like ""Deranged Barber"", ""Skinny Girls"", ""Nasty Toes"", and ""Chicks Don't Mind"". Not to mention the insanely dope guest appearances from the likes of Celph Titled, Apathy, Louis Logic, Guttamouf and many more - every MC seemed to have put forth their best effort.If you're a fan of hip hop from the likes of the Beatnuts, Alkaholiks, J-Zone, Demigodz, etc. Then it's guaranteed you will enjoy this release. I can't say anything more other than to make sure you pick this CD up... it's a must have."
4,Still a great voice,"Lou Rawls must be in his late 60s now but on this 2003 recording he proves he can still cut it. Yes, some of his range has gone and his voice isn't as assured as it used to be on the ballads, but it remains the richest, smoothest voice in the business. His phrasing is fresh and inventive and he really stamps his mark on these Sinatra classics. My favourite tracks are Nice and Easy, All the Way, Chicago, Learning the Blues and The Lady is a Tramp. Nice arrangements, great songs and a quality singer. Recommended."
3,pretty good but missing,I dig Lou Rawls but this Set doesn't fully work.His voice is still solid but He isn't able to fully pull off Covering Sinatra.it has moments but comes up short&I was hoping this would get Lou back on top again but this is a Good try but a bit short.I'd love to Hear Lou Cover Sam Cooke or Mel Torme stuff then He would Bring it.
3,Not as good as I hoped it would be.,"I've been buying Lou Rawls material for over thirty years. Love that deep rich voice. His last few productions have had a lot of good material; so I was expecting him to hit this CD out of the ball park. There are a few tracks I like; but most have something missing. Being familiar with the Sinatra originals, this is where I think the problems lie: 1) the back-up arrangements are not as good as the ones Sinatra got. 2) Mr. Rawls' phrasing suffers in comparison with Sinatra's. On the other hand Lou Rawls has every right to put his personal stamp on this material. In this instance he did not succeed as well as I hoped."
2,Rawls Sings From A Phone Booth,That's what the CD should have been called...this guy has an impeccable voice...so what do they do? They make a recording that was basically unlistenable to me....the orchestra was obviously recorded first and then Rawls sang overdubs....he sounds completely disconnected from the music...if you can get by this then the CD is recommended.
2,Little effort here,"Interested in the real FD? Buy their first two albums, both of which had some great tracks. ""Troubleshooters"" is really a good title, as this album had problems all over it. Maybe two or three good songs. The rest sounded amateurish."
1,Not what you'd expect,"If you liked Which Doobie UB, and Brothas Doobie, you probably won't like this album. Whatever it was that made Funkdoobiest great in the beginning is not involved with this disc. I think it's the absence of Muggs beats and uninspired lyrics and songs, too bad these guys went downhill. Which Doobie UB is probably my fav hip hop cd ever and this is probably the hip hop cd I most dislike, so whatever that says."
3,funkdoobiest,"these puerto ricans via new yoek,l.a. bring a latin flavored album thats more dance than hardcore hip hop.its not as good as their previous albums but its still worth it.the best songs are,""crazy puerto rican"",""on the premises"",""the anthem"",and""im feeling it"".its an average rap album but with a latin flavor to it.this cd is also an enhanced cd,so when inserted in your cd-rom you can see pictures and see a full length video on your computer screen."
1,Unreadable and pedantic,"Pasolini's cinema is profound and yet uncomplicated at the same time - I believe that his extraordinary films can be readily understood by the average viewer. Nonetheless, I was looking for a text that would help me to assess further the entire body of Pasolini's cinema, to see the common denominators in all the films and augment my critical eye. Rohdie's book is useless to me and mostly unreadable. The sentences are very long and pedantic. You keep waiting for facts or ideas that will enhance your appreciation of Pasolini's life and work but they never arrive. It appears to be a text that was written to impress academic colleagues or an editor. I have a graduate degree and studied film as an undergraduate, and I wouldn't recommend this boring volume even for use as a college textbook."
4,Counterinsurgency in East Africa,"This book recounts a specific operation carried out in Kenya in the 1950s as part of the war against the Mau-Mau, African insurgents who carried out terror attacks against the colonial forces and their fellow Africans. The effort centered around the effort to eliminate Kimathi, who was at the center of the Mau-Mau and who was holed up near Mount Kenya with a small but hard-core group of terrorists. The process of getting Kimathi involved thoughtful and long-term planning to get to this elusive and clever foe and it makes for good reading. Illustrated with line drawings and good maps."
4,Counterinsurgency in East Africa,"Based on the Bantam War Book edition: This book recounts a specific operation carried out in Kenya in the 1950s as part of the war against the Mau-Mau, African insurgents who carried out terror attacks against the colonial forces and their fellow Africans. The effort centered around the effort to eliminate Kimathi, who was at the center of the Mau-Mau and who was holed up near Mount Kenya with a small but hard-core group of terrorists.

1,What a waste of our time,"This is one of the dumbest concepts to come along in a very long time. It is a marriage made in hell - lousy electrontic music (which I can't get out of my head and gave me a headache) with fourth-rate videography of ""strippers"" dancing in silhouette. (Talk about false advertising, these aren't ""shadow dancers"").... it is one non-stop Apple iPod commercial of girls (we hope) backlit and gyrating.Save your money and get something else."
3,"An interesting exercise, but ultimately unsatisfying","This book has its moments, and some interesting passages. It avoids being a ""problem novel"", or being overly sentimental or overly dramatic. But, it's awfully hard to describe who the target reader would be for this. It isn't much of a mystery; it isn't a romance or an adventure. It's sort of about friendship, and family, and self discovery, but not in any groundbreaking or compelling way. It's more like a novel that grew out of a short story that grew out of a writer's workshop, where the assignment was to string together a couple of memorable character studies. So what you end up with is a sort of teen ""literary fiction"", which strikes me as a pretty hard sell to a modern reader."
4,FFM review,"The story is about Homer Winthrop, his mother and Roger, Homer's friend. The setting is in Maine, where their old house is located. The Winthrops return to Maine unexpectedly, from their home in Boston.When they arrive, Homer goes to his old room which he thinks is special, because it still has some of his old stuff in it. Homer re-unites with Roger, a neighbor.Roger tells Homer about a strange man who dresses up like an older person and wears a wig. They call him ""Fake Man."" As the story unfolds, Fake Man helps Homer find out about his dad, who had died when Homer was only two years old.. This is information that his mother would never talk to him about.In the end, Homer and Roger find some old stuff belonging to Homer's dad. They use these things to make a tribute to his dad, since Homer now understands what actually happened.I thought the book was interesting and would recommend it to my friends and anyone who reads this review."
5,Following Fake Man,"Following Fake Man was a great book, I rated this book with 5 stars! Homer Winthrop has a very interesting life not knowing much about his family.This book had alot of great details and the characters had great personalities. I wondered through the whole book why Homers mom didn't tell him anything about his Dad? I felt sorry for Homer because he didn't know one thing about his dad because he had died. His dad was really sick so he decided to kill himself before Homer was born. The author made it seem that Homer didn't like his mom because all that she has done to him. Now after reading this book I understand why his mom didn't want Homer making any friends while they where on vacation. At the end of the book Homer got all the infomation he was looking for with his family. This is what made the book so good. I really recommend this book for everyone."
4,Following The Past,"Not knowing about the past, especially your own, can leave a person feeling disoriented and downright frustrated. For Homer, our main character, the past is a room with all the lights off--he is completely in the dark.He wants to know about his father, who died when Homer was only two years old. But no one is talking, especially not his mother who suffers from chronic migraine headaches that leave her incapacitated for days.In order to discover his past and find his father, Homer must step out of his comfort zone and do something that is very difficult for him. Does he have the courage? Author, Barbara Holmes, ingeniously handles a very delicate subject by weaving you through Homer's adventure of ""Following Fake Man."" And because he has stepped out and taken a risk Homer finds the light of a past filled with happiness and pain.""Following Fake Man"" is a very thoughtful and difficult subject, worth a reading."
2,An ok book,"I gave this book two stars because it was more bad then good. I mean the kids could have met a little differently. that's because who meets someone on vacation that they don't know and they just saw shoot a guy, and after he sees the one kid shoot the man he talks to him like they have been friends forever. Then they start hanging out every day.The only good part is the mystery behind the fake man and how it ends. It ends completely different then I thought it would. At first you'll think the old man is a kingpin drug dealer, but i guess you'll have to read it to find out how it ends."
5,Excellent,"A true hidden gem, excellent music a must for any John Cipollina fan. The CD is very well done and sounds great. The group sounds like they played a lot together, very even and well rehearsed. The music is pure rock and roll and very well played."
5,Wonderful fun,"This is a great deal considering the corner stores I used to buy a single pack in charged over $2. Great nostalgia. I'm not ashamed to say as an adult, I had a great time opening a fresh pack and reliving the excitement of getting random new additions to my collection."
2,Lower quality than the rest of this series,This educational video is lower quality than the rest of this series. Background video summaries are far too short and without enough detail. The expert comments are very dated regarding the current geopolitical situation.
2,Solo's.....Please!!!!!!!!,"This band worked there a**'s off making an album that would be great if they would have scattered 8 to 10, 10 to 20 second guitar solo's over it. There is perfect places for them everywhere, in every song......were is Andy Sneap when he is needed most. Don't believe me, I'm just a 37 year (44 years old) Metal Veteran - Just listen to the New EXODUS cd it will all become LOUD and clear.Buuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.....JRK"
5,Boxboarders: A Fun Ride!,"I loved this movie. I can't believe it wasn't in the theatres. Young audiences would love it. The young cast was great, the story was a lot of fun! I laughed throughout this zany film which is more than I can say for some of the so-called comedies I saw in theatres this summer! See it!"
5,"Great, TASTY one dish meals!","I was lucky enough to attend a cooking demonstration/tasting conducted by the author and was thrilled to find a book that lives up to it's title! Not only are the recipes wonderfully flavorful, they are indeed stylish and EASY."
3,this book needs better design,"My main problem with the book is that it is difficult to read. The ingredients are put in a bold, difficult to read type. All the recipes as well as chapter titles are on the left hand page and many of the right hand pages have a lot of blank, poorly utilized space.It just makes me out of sorts trying to read it.I'm sure other reviewers will say I haven't really reviewed the book and passed judgement on the actual recipes but that's the way I feel. I can't use a cookbook unless it is user friendly."
4,Silly old bear .... always making rainy days sunny!,"Pooh Print Artist is a great tool for all of you Pooh freaks like me. It is extrememly easy to use and has a ton of different Pooh pictures and lots of different ways to use them. You don't have to be a computer genius to use this software effectively. Even a child could do it, and it's fun, fun, fun!!!!!!"
3,Not a Mage,This is quite differant from a mage or magic user. I really like the witch and militant wizard kits. I'm 4th edition paladin.
5,Everything you need to know about wizards,"Bobby MacGregor (macgregor@earthlink.net)This book has everything anyone would want to know about wizards and then some. It's set up not badly with easy to access information. Anyone who wants to be a wizard should definitely buy this book, it's worth the money."
3,"A good read, but not particularly game-enhancing","This book contains a large amount of enjoyable information on the various schools of magic and provides a host of kits, but if you have a clear idea of what your character is like, none of it is really going to enhance your enjoyment of the game. The methods for researching new spells given are pointless, you could have invented much better rules yourself. There are also far too few new items (in fact, there are basically NO new items).Having said that, the new spells are worthwhile, and the afflictions are pretty cool. If you are an avid wizard fan, a good and recommended purchase, but it does not really provide as much ""meat"" as it should do."
3,A good expansion that needs more meat,"The kits are not good enough. The spell section needs to be beefed out. Basic stuff restated elsewhere in most sections. If you REALLY like wizards it's worth it, otherwise buy Spells and Magic becasue that has more usefull wizard stuff."
2,The spells are good,"This ain't the best of the complete class books. I found most of the kits not very useful, and the description of the specialists was nothing more but repeating the Player's handbook - let's not mention the ""special abilities"" for specialist mages (I'm talking about a +1 save vs alteration magic at level 17 here!). If you want some more spells, especially some necormancy, then get this book, it has some really cool spells in it. But that's about all."
3,Great Amp - Poor Packaging by Hartke,"First the good news - the amp itself gets 5 stars - it is everything that all the reviews you read on line say. It sounds great and has a lot of nice features I'm still playing with. Ifou can get one, you will be very pleased with it.Now the bad news - the packaging from Hartke gets 1 star. This is a very heavy amp, as advertised, yet Hartke seems to be coompletely unaware of the stresses their package goes through in transit. The first amp arrived badly damaged and even the replcement Amazon sent ""Next-Day"" had a couple of dings (Though tolerable... Hartke just places a lightly cardboard shrouded amp into a very cheap, flimsy, outer cardboard box with no extra padding, foam forms, or other isolation. The inevitable man-handling of the amp in-transit goes straight to the amp.So, go ahead and order the amp, but be prepared to deal with what is delivered - Carefully disassemble the box becasue you might need it to return the amp!"
4,Cool......,I thought this book was quite good....especially for a beginner who wants more info on Korn shells and on process related Unix commands
1,Won't play. Replacement won't play either.,"I have a brand new Blu-Ray player and I have a dozen Blu-Ray disks and they all work except this disk (HD Moods: Trains). I sent the first disk back and order a second (HD Moods: Trains), it won't play either.Anyway be warned that this disk might not play."
3,"Involving, yet disappointing","Just finished this book, and I absolutely agree with Amateur Revier 2. It took a while to finish, in part I think, because I often found Millay personally annoying. Don't know how Milford felt; as mentioned before, she isn't one to give opinions or analysis. Perhaps because I read it on a Kindle, I also found the construction confusing. Quotes ran into poetry and the author's own prose. I found myself looking back to try to figure out whose ""voice"" I was reading. Later on, I became less diligent and just went with the flow."
2,Fascinating Subject -- Frustrating Bio,"The author of this book seems almost completely incurious as to the motivation and sources of Millay's actions. She provides a complete chronology but almost never asks why. Why marry this man? Have that affair at this time? Why no children? Why the apparent indifference (other than in her poetry) to spiritual questions? Etc.Millay's charm is evident in her letters and her talent is illustrated by the poetry that is quoted. But Milford never seems interested in asking why this woman behaved so unconventionally for her time and her class. Even when Millay mentions her ""philsophy"" Milford doesn't bother to discuss what that philosophy was and how it was revealed in her poetry and/or other writing.As other reviewers have noted -- the book documents a lot of her sexual behavior -- but never tries to provide shed any light on the sources of that behavior. So the book ends up being sort of prurient without ever being graphic.A big disappointment."
4,Enlightening,Surprised to find out she had a very active and interesting life. Would not know it by the writings she composed.
4,good cream,"My firnd starte dusing this , so i started , it would take , It does not happpen overnight , wait for ur results"
1,Unsound,"I could not be more clear when I say this book is a waste of your time. Not only have I know the author personally, but I know the fruit it produces. The book seems to aim at the fear mongering aspect of Christianity, and seems to draw on the heartstrings of those who are either more susceptible to fearfulness or those who want to be feared. The contents of this book are of the more destructive titles that come to mind. If you must find out for yourself, remember that this book is provided via the church that financed its publication."
1,Dangerous Book- Dangerous Author,"I read Part 1 of this book before the unsettled feeling I had caused me to put it down. Its reasoning bears all the marks of a 'christian' cult. A quick internet search reveals that Timothy Williams and his ""Sound Doctrine Church"" are frequently identified by ex-members as an abusive cult. In March 2009, a NC Judge even ruled that a woman could not homeschool her children based on the mother's involvement with this author and his church. PLEASE stay far away from this book and its author. The poison is carefully concealed in truth. ReadThe Cost of Discipleshipinstead."
3,For the general public,"I enjoyed the DVD for what it is conveying and that is, bringing science to the greater audience for them to start to understand where science and medicine are heading. I agree that the DVD doesn't give any scientific backup to what they are explaining. That could be seen as a fault or it could be seen as a way of enticing the lay person to start to recognize the direction our world is moving into. I think if anyone is interested in the scientific explanations in the topics raised they can then find those through Google search or they will find many books that will satisfy that such as Dr Bruce Lipton's and Dr Candice Pert's as well as many others.Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
5,Changes the way you look at your mind and body and medicine,"In this must-watch DVD, The Living Matrix takes an in-depth look at bio-energetic medicine and how it heals the body through the power of positive thought and life energy. Leading researchers and health care practitioners share their discoveries and ""miracle cures"" that traditional medicine cannot explain. The story begins with a young Greek boy diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Conventional doctors said he would never be able to walk on his own, play unassisted or even feed himself. When the family took the son to see Dr. Eric Pearl for Reconnective Healing, the child's healing began almost instantly. He now plays, walks and feeds himself, and his future looks much brighter than originally diagnosed. This film may very well change the way you look at your mind and body and medicine.-- Jelina Vance, New Connexion Journal[...]"
4,Intriging,This movie affirmed other literature and movies I've read and viewed on the topic of energy and healing. This film fell on the heels of another documentary I watched on the importance of nutrition to ones overall health; both worthy of consideration and practice. I recommend this movie.
2,"""The Living Matrix"" Disappointment","DISAPPOINTED! I disagree with the high reviews this documentary has received. Upon my own review of this item, I found it to be nothing more than a meager and boring imitation of ""What the Bleep"" and ""The Secret,"" and has left me wondering whether it was created and intended for reasons other than to genuinely educate the viewer. There is no startling discovery about what this product can do for you. Had the film been rearranged differently and with some novel ideas, I would've given it a higher rating."
3,excellent book and quality,"ships fast, beautiful book. Very interesting reading I would recommend reading this book for its thought producing and considerations for a healthier future for yourself and world around you."
4,The Field on Film,"This film is largely based on the works of Lynne McTaggartThe Field Updated Ed: The Quest for the Secret Force of the UniverseandThe Intention Experiment: Using Your Thoughts to Change Your Life and the Worldand is a visual attempt to convey the failure of science to apply discoveries in quantum physics to the current biologic/medical model. The film does a ""fair"" job of it. The production was too much like ""The Secret"" which hinders the fine research collected in McTaggart's two books. If you enjoyed the books then see this film. If you haven't read the books and this film seems like something you'd be interested in go ahead and buy it and read the books later.The skeptics are, of course, out looking for blood. Pay them no attention and keep this quote by Ken Wilber with you at all times, ""scientism [is] the belief that there is no reality save that revealed by science, and no truth save that which science delivers."""
5,Fascinating!,I have watched The Living Matrix four or five times already and will see it again and again. I learn something new with every viewing. It is intriguing and very well produced. A must see!
5,Great movie,Great movie filled with lots of information that is cutting edge but easy to understand and apply. Enjoyed watching it several times definitely can be used with all age groups
5,Fantastic film!,"This film is cutting edge, both from the view of science and the study of consciousness. The information is simply invaluable to understanding how to heal from illness."
3,not the usual dummies book,I've read several Dummies books and in general liked them. They educate and entertain at the same time.This book was different. The author took most of the first two chapters telling the readers how good AUTOcad is and complaining that there was not enough room to detail all the options available in the software.In the book I got from the library I was using my AUTOcad 2007 by the time I finished the second page. While it was not as entertaining as a typical Dummies book AUTOcad 2007 for Dummies was not all that witty either.If you want to read the minimim in order to learn something about AUTOcad 2007 then the Dummies book might be for you. The other popular books on the subject are a lot thicker but much better detailed.
3,"Cartier Women's Leather Handbag, Onyx","this bag is very big and is good for business women to carry documents and files. It looks old style and I was just looking at that bag trying to figure out what I need it for. I returned it back. The quality is good...Cartier speaks for itself, but the bag is not functional."
2,Very Large,"This bag is very large. I ordered it for carrying my laptop and other work related items. The leather on the side of the handle puckers up and does not look even. When the bag is closed and hanging on my sholder the leather is not even. I returned the bag. I took three stars ( 1 for the size, 1 for the leather folding and the other for the markings on the leather)"
4,Nice product,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my father. I am pretty impressed with it--my one complaint is that some of the glue used to adhere the leather leaked out and turned the stitching a bit yellow in one spot. It's not too noticeable, though. It's not mentioned, but this does come with a plastic funnel to use to fill it. Overall I am happy with it."
1,Dont buy it!,This CD WAS GIVEN TO ME AS A GIFT AND IT'S TERRIBLE. SINGER NEEDS MUSIC LESSONS OR GIVE IT UP. HIS VOICE SOUND LIKE A CRYING SCARECROW. YUCK
4,"""Basics"" - Catchy songs with a strong country heart","This first CD released by Kermit Lopez is an excellent beginning and truly goes ""back to country basics"". The songs are genuine and heartfelt with memorable lyrics, great rhythms and instrumentals and an unaffected, uncommercial feel to them. This stuff is as good as anything you'll hear on the radio and more sincere. Way to go Kermit!"
3,Too distant from my usual routes ...,"Many books by D. Hofstadter are at the top standings of my personal parade, but in reading this book I found myself very likely too distant from my usual interests and preferred styles. The initial part is very interesting, but when the author carries on detailed descriptions about programs' features in conversational shape, I have been quickly bored, and I have given up attentive reading turning to an eagle eye approach. I would have been by far more comfortable with a more formal explanation, because, once I make the effort to follow the thourough description of what and how a program does, it is more convenient to study its algorithms.So, the book is surely very pleasing for people professionally involved in semantics, but I am not confident in its general interest."
4,Thought-provoking account of a diverse field of research,"Douglas Hofstadter is best known for his seminal work 'Godel, Escher, Bach' (1981), but not much was known about the work he carried out at the University of Indiana. This work collects a number of research papers from the 80s, thus offering a glimpse into the continuation of the work that was carried out with the help of the 'fluid concepts'-group. Hofstadter writes well, which means that the accounts of the projects that were undertaken are exciting, thought-provoking, and intruiging. I'm not entirely happy about the theoretical background to some of the work, maybe Hofstadter tries too deliberately to maintain things at a simple level. Still, if you're at all interested in the state of the art in AI research, this is a book you may not want to miss."
4,A great addition to the home kitchen,"This interesting and fun-to-read book really helps the home cook understand the hows and whys behind cooking and food, which is essential if one is to get beyond the stage of simple preparation and slavish adherence to recipies. Even better, this book has inspired me to want to learn more.I personally don't prefer the question and answer format, which is one reason it doesn't get five stars. Illustrations could help make difficult concepts more understandable, and it could stand to go through another revision and expansion. However, I found it a satisfying read, and well worth my money."
2,Get Harold McGee,"When I read that Hollandaise sauce shouldn't be made in lightening storms (page 151, 153), I couldn't help wondering how the experiment was run. Perhaps on a golf course. Really unenlightened. Suggest Harold McGee's books for a much more rewarding read."
2,Cutting Room Scraps,"Count on seeing bits and pieces of other movie plots glued together in this one. This is all done in a part of the world where the day is divided into 23 hours of darkness and 1 hour of daylight.Key words are; archaeological dig, evidence of missing link tribe, research team dead, ship wreck tourist land on island, they spread out and get picked off by missing link tribe, scary loud sounds, heartbeat and breathing sounds, one survivor left, she decides to go deep into the jungle to explore missing link tribal caves at night, kills leader, returns to sea on makeshift raft. The end."
1,Wow!!! What a Stinker!!!,"The cover purposely looks like Predator and Lance Henriksen makes a cameo, so I got suckered in. Like a really bad episode of Lost. The female lead even looks like Libby (Cynthia Watros). One of the worst movies ever, but I did watch the whole thing."
1,Terrible,"Poorly conceived, poorly executed, horrific acting, and boring to boot. I got the feeling that someone looking for a way to write off a boat rental and trip to the Caribbean came up with the idea for the piece of tripe. Do not waste your time watching this."
1,How bad can you make a movie?,"This is an awful movie wrapped around an quasi-interesting story. I'm sure the person who came up with the original idea for the plot had better things in mind when they pitched the story, but what came out the other end is nothing more than a cheap rip off of Congo meets Predator. Save yourself and don't ever watch this film. Horrible acting, cheap effects and a miserable plot."
2,Pretty bad-but I made it through the whole show,"Not quite bad enough to quit watching, but way too much of the same ol crap we've all seen a million times. On the plus side, they waited long enough to show the creatures to keep me in suspense. There were a couple scary parts where the characters are being stalked...by WHAT? On the negative side, its a low to no budget ripoff of predator, and all the other movies about a small group of friends that get picked off by monsters/slashers. Youngsters might enjoy it as they are still curious and learning about cheapies. Adults, who have been burned repeatedly by flix like this...beware!"
1,Cheesy predator rip-off,"Do not waste your time with this movie. It isn't even entertaining in a bad way, story is predictable and simplistic. I think they even used the same sound effects as predator. The acting is horrible, it is like watching a porno without the sex."
2,Don't buy,"Just fast forward to the last 20 minutes, the rest is just bull... In most bad movies you at least get to see some boobs. this is just a waste of time."
2,"dont, just dont",If i were one of the people THIS was dedicated to i would've changed my name out of shame(even if i were The Great One.)
2,Made for tv type movie,"The production value is about on par with a cable network movie. Maybe a tiny bit better. I'm surprised at all the horrible reviews though. This is no great movie to be sure but it's nowhere near the worst. Not by a long shot. It is as most have noted absolutley derivative of any jungle movie you have ever seen. Everything about it is mediocre. Not bad mind you but mediocre in the true definition of the word. It's not even close to being bad enough to make fun of and it's just a single notch above being able to hold your interest. Buy it? don't you dare, you'll be sorry if you do. Rent it? might be worth it if you really like jungle movies. Watch it free? it's worth a watch if there's nothing else that piques your interest."
2,They Should Have Stayed Lost,"A bad rip-off (is that a double negative) of ""Predator"".And the horror and blood fall way below the level ""Predator"" set for motion pictures. Don't buy this one unless you're really desperate. And then they want almost $23.00 for it.Come on. One of the signs of a bad movie is the higher cost. They sell less so they need more money up front. And it's too bad anymore that if a film has Lance Henricksen in it, it's to try and convince you it's a good movie. Lance has become the saving grace for many movies. It's because Lance is such a great and classy act. It's getting to become a constant anymore. My advice, stay away from this one. If you have to see this, rent it first."
1,waist of time,"It was waist of time, the story setting and characters were absured and I just watched half of the movie and some scenes of the second half."
2,Lost 2 hours,"Not the most hideous piece of dreck ever filmed, but you'll never get those two hours back. Could've been a decent movie. The actors weren't bad - constrained by a script which follows this formula: incredibly bad choices made by ostensibly intelligent people results in violent monkey business."
4,Sized like most Collars,"Its pretty standard size. Fits 15lb chihuahua loose, and is tight as it go. My daughters little peanut is happy to have it. Been having hard time finding a good looking leather one that fits. Peanut is between sizes. The collar is really nice looking & Well made. Happy with it."
4,"Everything about windows, doors and mouldings","This book is just the thing for homebuyers, homeowners, real estate agents, builders and architects. With this as a guide, you'll look at doors, windows and moulding with a new eye.The book gives basic information about window frames, sashes, hardware, glazing material, weather stripping and important window measurements. It also discusses such window selection factors as light, ventilation, view, security and safety, architectural appearance, energy efficiency and ease of maintenance. You'll learn about available window units, glazing, measuring energy efficiency, window buying, installation, certification and maintenance.The book has analogous information for doorways and moulding. It's illustrated by line drawings and all too few photographs."
5,worth the money!,These were the first ceramic bearings I've ever purchased. They were costly but worth every penny. They are fast right out of the box. They are smooth as well and it feels almost like there's no friction at all between the bearing and the wheels. Since they are ceramic there is no metallic dust so servicing them is less of a chore. Wonderful investment. It is very likely that I may get new skates in the future but the bearings will last me a life time.
5,Excellent introductory text,"In response to the last review, any text book titled ""Principles of Anatomy & Physiology"" was never meant to be exhaustive. This textbook merely endeavors to skim the surface and provide a basic understanding of a very broad discipline. (Read the Preface). No book can plumb the depths of every human physiological system AND its clinical applications in 1000 pages. (But if one exists, I'd sure like to know about it!) In terms of presenting the introductory information I think the authors have done a great job. I admire the excellent design layout and the numerous visuals. I don't think there can be too many visuals in a book that attempts to introduce complex concepts to those who would be unfamiliar with them. And as a reference book, these make it pretty easy to locate information."
5,Perfect for the massage practioner,This book is recommended for taking your national massage board exams. I have found it to be a wonderful book and very easy to follow throughtout the chapters. It is very detailed and full of information.
3,Good toy but wrong one!,"My son chose the land shark morphibian but we received a different model. Instead we got the dirt frog...it is weird because there are two land sharks listed-one looks like a shark (sort of)-which we picked, and one looks just like the dirt frog truck. Anyway, we kept it because my 4 year old couldn't bear the thought of waiting another 2 weeks for the right toy. He's happy but once in a while asks why they sent the wrong one! Only problem we have is it seems to go through batteries pretty quickly."
1,I'd rather use crayons to make a card,"We were very excited to get this software because we are HUGE fans of Disney, but we think this software is absolutely awful! The graphics are poorly organized, many of the graphics are fluff and fillers (i.e. the same images only in black & white then again in color), and, overall the program is cumbersome and tedious to use. We are so disappointed in both Sierra and Disney, we suggest you don't waste your time or money."
5,"John F.Kennedy, Jr. :A Life in Pictures.",I thought the book fully lived up to my expectations. It gave me access to photos I had not seen before (and I am a rabid Kennedy fan) . I would recommend it to anyone interested in the Kennedy family.
3,Lack-luster for Haynes,"I have several Haynes manuals for several different models of automobiles and while I find this one generally helpful, it falls short of the usual Haynes quality. It is particularly ambiguous when it comes to interior trim and equipment removal. For example: in the index there is an entry referring to removal of speakers on page (I forget), but when you go to that page there is nothing about speakers. Haynes usually beats Chilton manuals because of the extensive photo usage, but this one falls short."
1,for idiots only,"This is a good book if you have an extremely low IQ and need chapters and chapters on how to select which car model you want to buy. If that is your biggest problem when it comes to buying a car, then you are either very rich or very stupid. There are much better books around on how to deal with dealers, getting the most for your used car, not getting screwed on a lease, etc. The only adivce this book had on bargaining with dealers was ""if you're not comfortabe with what's going on in the dealership, walk out."" Sorry, but there's a lot more to negotiating than that."
2,Waste of Time & Money,I found this book to be over simplistic and patronizing as well as a complete waste of effort and time when compared to other books in this category. Would not reccommend.
2,Fine and dandy folks.,It was difficult finding things and confusing but overall it was a fine and dandy book.
2,"The Fey series shows maturity, the second book is great","With a slow start to set up the ""Fey Universe"", the second bookshows considerable strength of character, building on thefirst book. There are two plot twists that caught meby surprise. and I normally see a plot twist 50 pagesin advance.buy the first and second together! The third, whenit comes out, should be great"
4,One of the better fantasy series,"Although I'm relatively new to the fantasy genre, I know a good fantasy story when I see one -- and this is one of them. Ms. Rusch knows how to draw you in to a story and make you feel, see, and hear what the characters experience. This story had many surprising twists to it -- some I didn't really care for, but that was only because I wanted something else to happen. I loved the strength that the characters found within themselves when they needed it; and with all of the devious scheming going on in this book, they needed it alot! A very good read!"
5,Good Book,"My boyfriend and I are going through this book together. It's a really good book for couples who are wanting a book that will help them explore their relationship and grow with God. It is a real ""learning"" book--it causes us to learn so much about each other. Lots of questions. A great book."
4,Positive,"Quick delivery, book in good condition other than the corner of cover being bent. Happy customer. Thanks."
3,Cute and Cuddly,"This Raccoon is cute and cuddly. I bought it as a replacement for my son's beloved ""Coonie"" that had an unfortunate meeting with my parents dog. The only problem I did have was that the raccoons I received were not identical to the photo shown. The Raccoons I received had a black feet rather than the grey shown. I am glad that my son is too young to realize the difference but I was a bit annoyed that what is shown is not exactly what you get."
5,"Very cute, and easy to snuggle to","I got this for myself, even though I am a grown woman with a 5 1/2 year old daughter. I have always loved raccoons. This is a very simple design, yet very snuggleable to sleep with. With my husband deployed, it is nice to have something to snuggle to. It is soft and squashy. A great addition to any raccoon lover's collection."
5,They don't make them like they used to...,"It was really amazing to recreate again this wonderful show, I only had vague memories on the back of my head when The Red Hand Gang was broadcasted back in 1978 or 1979 and I was a kid of that age (8 or 9), and my friends and I pretended we were the Red Hand Gang and rode on bycicle, skates, and it was a magical world, pretty different of all the games I sense kids are now into.When I discovered this DVD I couldn't help but buying it and it was worth every penny, so sad it didn't last that long but what I have now is solid gold."
4,Excellent Shaw Brothers film,"Nice... one of Liu Chia-Liang's best movies. Saw his cameo in there at Pai Mei's temple. Wow, Pai Mei, now I know why he's such a legendary villain, loved his character, but then again he was played by the always reliable Lo Lieh, who makes such a great villain, seen a couple dozen of his movies. I enjoyed the serious vibe most of the movie had. Not always a big fan of Liu Chia-Liang's humor, but the bride with super strong legs, who demanded her husband part them on his own before he could have her... ok that was hilarious."
5,Love it,I am a true fan of Maritial arts movies and the action is great. I love Shaw Brothers their movies never gets old to me.
2,For the die hards,"Do not expect a Hollywood type of action. If you enjoy just the Kung Fu action, then this is for you, otherwise,it is not."
5,Solid Apron,"Good apron. Thick material, and sturdy construction. D ring closure for the neck is good, and doesn't come undone. I'd buy it again, although I was hoping for a little lighter blue, kind of like Royal Blue, but the color is exactly is as shown, so that's good."
5,Best apron ever!,"This is probably the best apron I have ever owned. It's made of quality material and has a cute design. It also washed and dried great. My only complaint is that this is the third apron I've ordered from the company, but the first one I have actually received. The first two ran out of stock after I made the purchase. The company emailed me stating that they were sorry and had not charged my credit card. After receiving this apron though, I understand why they sold out so fast."
3,Does Not Work for Large Dogs,"This does not work for medium to large dogs (40lbs and up). They can just step right over it if you use this for entrances. Go for the medium or large Scatmat because it is wider, so they would actually have to jump over to avoid it."
2,Good advice interspersed with not so good advice.,"For the most part the book is easy to follow and entertaining, but not terribly thorough and EXTREMELY TENDENCIOUS (some very questionable stuff is said with great aplomb). There is a decent section on footwork for the beginner-to-intermediate and some interesting tactical advice. The sabre section is nearly 10 years out of date (fleche and all). Don't buy this if you are planning to be in the next Olympics, but if you are a recreational fencer with a little bit of experience have a look."
4,good but,"the mice it's nice, works very good in sensitivity, but the retractable sistem may be turn the cable and can do a little bit dificult to extract and retract the both sides. But the performance it's very good."
3,It's Ok,"Only works on a dull colored mouse pad, retractable cord works sporadically, smaller than it looks in photo, so for small hands only."
3,watch the recoil,"Nice unit, however, one has to follow directions exactly or the wire will get tangled upon rewinding and untangling is almost impossible. Also, the recoil mechanism at the USB end of the cord is yet another item to deal with and tends to weigh the cord down making use of this mouse a bit awkward."
3,Does the job but needs getting used to,"I have had so many annoyances with fighting for signal bandwidth for my wireless mice that I've gone back to wired. And this one turned out to be a decent solution. I feels small and awkward, but that may be true of all compact mice designed to be netbook/laptop accessories. The unwind/rewind feature is convenient. The big question is if that concentrates too much stress on the wire at the exit of the mouse. It's more sensitive than my other mice, but that also means that I need to move my hand less. That is useful when I'm in a cramped space in an airport."
1,Just Didnt' Work...,"I would have given this product a zero rating if it were available. I was very disappointed to find the the Wenger mouse didn't work right out of the box. I also tried out the retractable cord and that didn't work very smoothly at all, immediately becoming tangled. If not for that, I probably would have asked for a replacement, but instead chose to just return the item. Prior to this purchase I bought a cordless Wenger mouse in a local Wal-mart and within a week the buttons started to stick, they replaced it for me and within a few days the replacement started to malfunction also. I would suggest staying away from this manufacturer when it comes to computer mice. I don't think it's just a coincidence that all 3 of their products had defects."
4,Love these guys,"The Tims are a fast favorite. Their rollicking live shows are a blast, improved by being in places where Guinness is served. This CD is a nice sample of their tunes, a mix of traditional, contemporary and original music given own unique treatment. It could only be improved by being longer and better capturing their live performance. Their latest CD, =Drunkards, Bastards and Blackguards= does those things and will get my 5-star review when it arrives here."
3,"Ok, but not the best quality",Not quite worth the money. It is quiet but is not easy to take apart and clean. Base is just plastic and they don't give you enough rocks to cover the entire base.
4,stands on its own...,"Every Loreena CD stands on its own.Every single one is gorgeous and all have their own mood and development. This one is simple and pure. Words and voice seem more important while the instruments sort of hang out.Other than that, this CD creates magic in your house!"
5,Celtic Beauty,"I bought this CD for myself as a birthday present since I love Loreena so much! I was so glad I did! :) This CD is definately Celtic in flavor and is different than Loreena's future releases, which shows her progress as an artist. The best tracks on this CD are ""Standing Stones"", ""Dickens Dublin"" and ""Annachie Gordon"". Fans will not be disappointed."
5,Parallel Dreams,"Loreena McKennitt is one of my favorite artists. That is why I have had to order this CD for the 4th time. I'm just wearing them out, I guess."
4,Loreena McKennitt is simply amazing!,"This is one of McKennitt's earlier albums. While her work here is a little simpler than that on her more recent albums, this CD is definitely worth purchasing, especially for any McKennitt fans. ""Annachie Gordon,"" the Romeo and Juliet ballad, is my favorite on this album; it haunts me still. ""Huron 'Beltane' Fire Dance"" is hypnotic, and ""Ancient Pines"" is absolutely beautiful. Just as on any of Loreena McKennitt's albums, her lovely vocals and gorgeous instruments make the CD a listening joy and pleasure beyond that of many other artists."
5,Parallel Dreams is unparalleled EXCEPT by Loreena's others,"I have not found fault with any of Loreena's works at all. Parallel Dreams is no exception. In my book, she just cannot do wrong. Evocative, timeless, a swirling vortex of archetype and sound."
3,Early work,"Prospective purchaserts should be aware that this album originally came out in 1989, and is nowhere as somplex or interesting as her later work. However, thisnis hee first album of all original material,a and is certainly boteworthy for that reason alone. That she continues to improve and develop as an artist is to her credit. But don't expect ""The Book of Secrets"" style work from this worthy predecessor."
5,Thanks Loreena...,"While I write these lines I'm listening this album, and sincerely, I believe that it's the better Loreena's album, because mixes the misticism celt with the pop ballad like no other. ""Breaking the Silence"", a song for Amnesty International, is the best example, a beautiful and frightening song that combines the magic and the enchantment of Loreena with a powerful and moving letter. Really a great song, marvelous. Listen to ""Huron Fire Dance"" is to be transported to ancient Ireland and the celtic rites. Separate mention deserves to ""Standing Stone"", ""Ancient Pines"" and ""Dicken's Dublin"", my other favorites. All this album is my favorite.Thanks Loreena for your music."
4,"Celtic? Yes, But I Like It Too","A wonderful amalgam of Loreena's Celtic knowledge and breath-taking vocal style, this album is soft, Celtic, romantic and pagan all at once. These melodies have inspired me since teenage-hood and continue to litter my dreams with beautiful music that wonderfully marries historic folk songs. So, is there anything wrong with this CD? Yes...I'd stay clear of 'Dicken's Dublin' and I'd also honestly say that 'Ancient Pines' is her least impressive piece, though it's still evocative and pleasant. Pick it up, or download it and overall, you'll be satisfied with the way it transports you through time...especially on foggy autumn nights and crisp winter days."
2,Really can't give an honest opinion because the whole cd was sratched from start to finish,Well I gave it a rating just so I could post my review. I know I could have returned it but its just such a big hassle.I guess I could go to my account and find out who the sender was. Then I have to talk to the knucklehead people who sent out a CD in such HORRIBLE condition and I said any company who would send out such a product would just be a waste of my time.
4,Loreena's Parallel Dreams,"That voice...that harp....pure heaven. Loreena McKennitt's 1989 album ""Parallel Dreams"" is a very beautiful album, featuring such haunting, atmospheric, magical songs as ""Samain Night,"" ""Annachie Gordon,"" ""Ancient Pines,"" and my personal favorite, ""Standing Stones."" Once again, Loreena simply casts a spell over the listener, with her goddess-like voice, harp-playing, and musical arrangements. ""Parallel Dreams"" is an excellent disc."
5,Best Kept Secret?,"I was introduced to Loreena McKennitt just a year ago through ""The Book of Secrets"". I now own ""The Mask and Mirror"", ""The Visit"" and, most recently, ""Parallel Dreams"". ""Parallel Dreams"" is her best yet. From the soaring vocals in ""Samain Night"" through the astonishing power of ""Breaking the Silence"" and the serene finish of ""Ancient Pines"", this is a truly remarkable album.Loreena McKennitt seems to be a best kept secret. I wish more people were familiar with her work and took the same immense pleasure in it I do. She deserves far more attention than she has gotten so far, but it's nice to be in a relatively small and exclusive club of admirers.Like some other reviewers I am a devoted Enya fan. Both artists have had a profound impact on me: something in their music gets into the deepest recesses of my heart. No one could ever replace Enya, but I'm happy to welcome Loreena into the Enya stratosphere."
3,"Hate to Break her Streak, but...","...""Parallel Dreams,"" although an excellent collection as always, seems to lack. Ms. McKennitt's voice is lovely and lyrical as ever, her music charmingly Celtic, ""Annachie Gordon"" is particularly haunting, although ""Ancient Pines"" a little too New Age in sentiment, yet the album seems to carry very few of the musically experimental elements I had come to love and expect from ""The Book of Secrets"" and ""The Mask and the Mirror."" Her blend of dialogue and song in ""Dickens' Dublin (The Palace)"" does not wholly work, perhaps due to the difference in recording techniques, or the ""pop"" sound of the music. Great fans of Loreena McKennit should definitely invest in this album, but I must regretfully deny that it is her best work ever."
4,Very cute and soft,"I was afraid that these wouldn't look as good in person, but they are super cute and very soft. I got them as much as decoration as anything (my son's nursery is Neverland...Peter Pan), but my son seems to enjoy them. My only complaint is that they aren't really age appropriate for my baby (not yet 1 year old) and I'm afraid to leave it in the crib to cuddle because of it (he still bites his blankets and stuffed animals)...I can't really fault the product for that though."
5,"Great reference, also fun to browse","This book is a great reference that touches everything, taking the reader through the steps in the formation of a new company. And there are a lot of steps. But my favorite feature of the book is that it is easy to browse. Any page you open to has something interesting on it, and you can start reading there without needing to read everything that comes before. The book is stocked with short real-life examples (with the names changed) taken from the authors' own experiences as business lawyers. Separately, it has a running story of a fictitous start-up going through each of the stages dicussed. My idea of what's interesting may be influenced by the fact that I work for an eight-person start-up."
2,Was this a Bond Story?,"It was good to see the return of SPECTRE, but any reader will be able to pick up on the plot twist because it's so predictable. Also their is a lot of technical gibberish in this novel."
2,FOR SPECIAL SERVICES reads like a movie,"This was John Gardner's second James Bond novel and it was an improvement over his first. He resurrects SPECTRE in this one. The American military depicted in this book seems strangely reminiscent to the depiction in ""Goldfinger."" It was a little like déjà vu, nothing specific. It was almost like a wisp of memory.My real objection in this book is James Bond's relationship with Felix Leiter's daughter. I think Ian Fleming would have objected."
2,SPECTRE Wants Revenge for JAMES BOND,"FOR SPECIAL SERVICES was John Gardner's second James Bond novel and it was an improvement over his first. He resurrects SPECTRE in this one. The American military depicted in this book seems strangely reminiscent to the depiction in ""Goldfinger."" It was a little like déjà vu, nothing specific. It was almost like a wisp of memory.My real objection in this book is James Bond's relationship with Felix Leiter's daughter. I think Ian Fleming would have objected."
5,WOW best book,This is the best book around for foraging. This book I recomend to everyone. Who knows if you will someday need to eat these foods for survival.
5,Informative and Durable,The book is very informative and very easy to find what you are looking for. The book is very well made using plastic like pages that should hold up well in your backpack.
5,Very handy guide.,This is the best book I've found on edible plants. Very nice pictures. Love the extra information on medicinal properties. Highly recommended.
4,It travels well,"The guide is very useful - but the pictures are a little too small! I wished I could've held the book in my hands first and seen the thumbnail reference pictures. I could have easily looked for something better illustrated.That being established, if used in conjunction with a thoroughly illustrated home reference, this would be very useful to refer to in the woods."
5,A fascinating book for outdoor enthusiasts,"The book has colour photographs for every plant listed, and all of the species are grouped according to family, for easy reference. Suggested preparations, identifying features and safety precautions are included for every plant in the book. There is a very important section on poisonous plants that every hiker/mountaineer should read. traditional Native medicinal uses are also listed.I take this book everywhere I go."
4,Second edible plant guide,I use this book as a field guide along with a second book. They cover the information I need in the mountains.
5,Author review of The Echo of Thunder,"As I am the writer of the book Thunderwith on which this movie is based,I just want to tell you that the quality of the video is terrific. It was well reviewed in theTHUNDERWITHNew York Times when it was released and Judy Davis was nominated for an Emmy for her performance as Gladwyn- so it's a satisfying family movie. And I'd also like to ask as to advice for it to be a DVD much more ready to use these days.Thanks for swift deliveryLibby Hathorn[...]"
3,for a further reflection,"the movie echo of thunder, based on the novel thunderwith is put together very ulike the book. i am not at all discrediting the directer, but for those who have read the book can reflect very negativly towards the film. the characters seen in the novel are explored in extreme depth and detatil brought togetther with libby hathorns extensive use of colourful language. i reccomend reading the book as a runup of the movie. u will be highly impressed.From....Me"
4,Great compliance ideas,"This is a very good compliance book. Gives lots of ideas, a few forms. Would be very good for a new DON or a new QA employee."
1,Please send items only when collected completely,"Good morning all, please collect all 3 combo packs and then send them together, do not send the items separetely please.I prefer to wait till you collect all 3 combos rather than receive one by one.I really appreciate your help, thanks and regards"
1,Bad Ink,I have purchased ink in the past from others but I had to switch printers and could only find this ink cheap enough from this seller. Big Mistake the ink runs and the black ran out after 15 pages.
3,"Nice results, but as expected, they are spendy and they run out too fast.","I have owned a few inkjet printers over the years, and these cartridges, which are for my HP PSC1315V, are typical of the cartridges I have used since I started. Costly, run out of ink too fast, but they produce nice print results. No wonder printers are so cheap. They constantly nail us on ink instead!"
3,Not exactly what I expected.........,"I know it says hp on the box and they look like the right cartridges, but somehow, I wonder. The print is more dark gray than black, no matter how I set the print specs. And the first cartridge ran out sooner than I'd expected to since I had not done a lot of printing off of it. I think maybe next time, I'll shop locally for this kind of product."
1,HP 56/57 C0321FN#140 Tri-Color Ink Cartridge,It does not fit my printer. I need the combination pack 564 setup so I hope I can exchange this one for the correct one.
5,good and cheaper,"i enjoy getting a good deal. this is the way to go when you need both colors, black and color."
5,THE BEST!,"THESE INK ORIGINAL CARTIDGE'S WORK ALL THE TIME I USED ORIGINAL'S. THE REPLACEMENTS SOMETIMES DON'T WORK.56,57,AND HP PHOTO INK WORK FIRSTTIME AND EVERYTIME!"
3,Doesn't work in HP officejet 7310,Although Amazon says this will work in an HP Officejet 7310 it won't. Called HO and the seller and both agreed with me. Amazon took it back with no problem. Just in case Amazon still says it works in an HP Officejst 7310.
4,as promised,good price on what I think is an overpriced commodity (printer ink). Bought the bundle which reduced the overall cost.
4,Speedy Service!,The ink came much sooner than the estimate which is greatly appreciated. The price was the lowest I've found for this set. My only complaint is that HP charges so much! I know it's not the sellers fault-they were great. Just wish HP would charge less while times are tough.
3,Was expecting the original hp label packaging.,Order rec'd as two separate cartridges. I was expecting to receive the item based on how the picture was shown online in it's original manufacture's packaging. Please be more specific in the details so the customer knows exactly what they are ordering.
1,Be ware!,"I thought I was getting HP 56/57 Cartridges in Retail packaging just as the picture indicated. When it arrived, it was remanufacturered cartridges, plus one had been crushed in shipping and ink was all over the inside of the box and envelope. Contact seller and received full refund. Just be advised you will not get what you think you are ordering. Good luck."
1,This ink did not last,"First off, it wasnt even from HP.Second, the ink did not work for more than a couple documents I printed. I am very disappointed with this purchase :("
1,Defective cartridges after very little printing,"I purchased these cartridges in March & have printed about 30 pages using these cartridges. Suddenly they no longer work & keep giving the error message--Remove and check cartridges. I have followed all the cleaning & correcting procedures suggested in the online forums & still can't get rid of this error except by replacing these (should be good, but aren't) cartridges. Return period has expired, so I'm not a happy user at all."
5,Always get Name Brand Ink,"For example, if you have an HP printer, get HP ink. I once tried using another brand of ink for my HP printer and the colors were really bad.I haven't used this ink yet, but it is HP ink and it arrived in good shape. This seller gave Very fast service."
4,Good ink,"It's ink, it's expensive and that is the game we play to print stuff. I just bought a Canon (MG 2220) printer/scanner/copier for $30.00 (new) $45.00 with tax and shipping from another big box store. I ordered the ink from Amazon (they have decent prices for ink) and paid $47.00. Go figure!"
3,It's cheap for a reason,"I do enough printing that I thought getting a deal on toner would be a good idea. Well, you get what you pay for. While this is significantly cheaper than the same toner in the store, it does not last nearly as long. I got barely a quarter of the pages out of this toner that I did out of the full priced stuff. Not worth it."
4,HP INK,Cartridges were of quality hoped for and as promoted---genuine HP ink cartridges. Work just fine and should last better that off brands and refurbished ones bought previously on Amazon.
5,Great ink.,This ink is kind a pricey but it takes months or a year before I replace it.I like also the quality of the prints.Good buy.
5,Very Satisfied,The cartridges are original HP and they are an excellent value. I would definitely purchase from this vendor again as I am totally satisfied.
2,Not what I expected,I bought the (3) set. The theme is very simular. I listen to the CDs daily but not getting the changes I expected.
4,Durable and Stretchable,"These socks stretch great and can be worn by both me (age 30, women's shoe size 8.5) and my 6 year old daughter (age 6, shoe size 1). They do not have any holes in them yet and have been worn at least 5 times. To me that is a good soccer sock because I find that so many of them rip and tear too easily! I suggest that you buy this product.adidas Metro II Soccer Sock"
3,"Great sock, but the strings...","I bought these socks for my daughter, and while she loved the fit and style, she complained that the socks frayed to easily. After each wash, we had to cut strings from the top of the sock and the heel. Despite this, no holes have formed...yet. The color, however, is great! All her teammates wanted to know where she got them from."
2,Same socks cheaper at store,"Good socks, but at this price I can buy better at the store. The type of fabric makes sweat a little more, I like the length and the colors.The adidas little sticker brand thing disappeared after using it twice."
4,Who needs reality?,"The funniest parts of the movie are the unrealistic elements. That's the beauty of movies. In real life, these would be sad, inappropriate, etc moments. In the movies, you get to laugh with the charactors without taking it seriously. That said, I liked the ""corny"" be yourself ""life lesson"" at the end."
4,Very underrated.,I know everyone has been down on this film but it has it's funny moments. Bullock's quirky character isn't a first for her but this time she's VERY awkward. I don't know what it is about her character Mary but she's quite lovable. I won't go too much into plot since it's pretty obvious what the plot is. She's clingy and stalkerish and that's pretty much it. It's not the best movie I've seen but it's most definitely not the worst. I'd say rent it for cheap if you're really interested.
1,FAIL,"I am the self-acclaimed BIGGEST fan of Bradley Cooper, and also like Sandra Bullock, so I decided to give this flick a shot. I could NOT have been more disappointed. SERIOUSLY.Cooper's appearances in the film are scant and lame, and the film's efforts to canonize Bullock's quirky character fail miserably.The entire script is a woeful attempt at awkward humor that leaves you with a grimace instead of a grin.Ugh. I imagine this is one that Cooper and Bullock are embarrassed to put on their resumes..."
4,a very funny but unique movie.,"this movie did not get good review from most of the professional critics.Sandra did an above average job as the main character. Thomas Church performed.The script was average. However, it was a date movie for certain people."
4,Don't Believe the Critics...It's a Pretty Funny Movie!,"I didn't see this movie in the theaters, and was reluctant to watch it on DVD because of the bad reviews it got when it was released. I shouldn't have given the critics so much credence. This movie was funny! There were plenty of belly laughs, and none of them depended on grossing-out the viewer. This is a grown-up movie, and relies on your understanding of personality, human foibles, and the silliness of the media to generate humor. My recommendation is that you DO NOT read any synopsis of the plot...go into it cold. This will ensure that the insane turns this movie takes have their full kick!"
4,quite entertaining,"I found this movie to be quite entertaining. I have relatives that talk almost as much as Sandra's character in this movie. I found myself laughing a fair amount of the time during the movie. I got the joke that the media always looks for the worst in a situation to sensationalize it. When you watch the movie you have to wait until the end of the credits, there is a bonus scene after the credits that is worth waiting for. Is it the greatest movie ever, no, but it is good movie to make you laugh."
1,Genuinely BAD Movie,"I have always liked, admired and respected Sandra Bullock. She is a class act...the closest thing America has to a real princess.Having sad that, it saddens me that I feel compelled to warn others how bad this movie really is. Believe the negative reviews. They are accurate. And the people who like this movie, steer clear of them. They have to have some sort of mental health problem.The only two redeeming factors in this movie, are Sandra Bullock's smile and the presence of Howard Hesseman. (Dr. Johnny Fever from ""WKRP"")Best advice I can give about this movie, do not watch it. You will be unhappy with yourself if you ignore this wise advice."
2,"Steve, steve....steve...","What a waste of time for my husband and me. This movie just isn't worth watching. It is a waste of acting ability for Sandra Bullock. She has so much more worth than this extremely shallow movie. Within 15 minutes she is in her underwear trying to have sex with some guy she just met, who is the Steve the title comes from.Romantic comedy doesn't describe this movie. There would have to be some romance some where for it to be given that description. This is one I won't be buying or recommending!"
1,AWFUL- SANDRA'S WORST MOVIE EVER,"I am usually a fan of Sandra Bullock's movies, but this one was just plain awful. The story line was poorly edited and lacked substance, even for a comedy. The box calls it the comedy that clings...it does, just like bad breath with a head cold. I took a lot of heat from my family for picking this one to watch New Year's eve."
1,AllAbout *Yawn*,This movie is so so so stupid. Pointless. The main character is beyond annoying. Blah.
3,Mediocre movie but Ms. Bullock is brilliant,"From a strictly objective standpoint, this movie is pretty terrible. However, I found Sandra Bullock to be so funny playing a certified nut case, I really enjoyed the movie. I think she has the ability to be the next Lucille Ball. Her physical comedy in this movie is simply sensational and many of the secondary roles are also brilliantly performed. However, I did not like the ending. I thought it was way too abrupt. With a better director and much better writers, this could have been a great movie given Ms. Bullock's performance and the originality of the story. It is a real shame. I hope Ms. Bullock is given more comedic roles. She has the talent, no doubt about it."
5,Buy it! Get it!,"Just DO IT! This movie is for anyone who has either been a nerd, or still is! Humor, and love. It has it all! This is a MUST for your ""feel good"" collection! :)"
3,one thumb up,"thought the movie was going to be a little funnier. Did not like the way it ended, sandra bullock does not do well in comedies."
5,The Importance of Being True to Yourself,"This is a great quirky movie about being true to yourself. When everyone is running around trying to be someone they are not, it's refreshing to see a person just being themselves and not worrying about what other people think."
2,not my favourite sandra bullock movie but ok,"""Mary"" (sandra bullock) is an eccentric but dorky crosswords writer who falls in love with a guy who isn't interested and chases him half way across the country.Sandra Bullock is such an effervescent actress who does romantic comedies so well, but her name is 'Mary' (which means bitter) and that undercurrent is right through her life in this character.They kind of crucify her as well to make it funny and it just isn't. (IMO)Steve is likeable, kind of, but yeah.Blah.Worth it for sandra bullock or if you like the guy who plays steve but a bit of a fail as a romantic comedy in my opinion overall. She's too awkward, and he's a bit of a skunk. And no happy ending."
4,A thoughtful lesson of life!,"Mary Horowitz (Sandra Bullock) is a crossword designer. Her fertile erudition becomes her a true nerd in the most literal of the term. That's why she is alone and isolated from the crowding world , just accompanied by her parents, the magic universe of the words and the knowledge.Her parents decide to make a blind date and since that first meeting, everything will turn for her. So, she will be forced to use all her talent and perseverance to follow he bliss just to find that not only that glitters is gold.A soft summer breeze comedy with the lovable Sandra Bullock (who not only has grown up as professional, but eventually has become the most sympathetic actress of Hollywood) in a natural and spontaneous role that surely will engage you.A smart script with clever touches of humanity."
1,All About Stalking And Being A Stupid Movie,"Oh my how awful this movie was, I was cringing from start to finish, Sandra acted like she was in a 60's beach movie and it made this a total wipeout.For those who thought Speed 2 was oscar material, all others beware."
1,"MOVE ALONG FOLKS, NO COMEDY HERE","I watched this piece of drivel for 30 minutes and I never even came close to cracking a smile or even chuckling. Towards the end of this nearly 2 hour flop, I considered crying for the precious time I wasted from my life. I am thinking about submitting a screenplay to Hollywood, apparently no entertaining storyline is required. Waste of time, waste of talent, waste of money, waste of film!"
1,How good actors can get swindled into bad movies,"Save your money. Watch the paint dry on your walls instead. I find it hard to believe that an actor like Bradley Cooper, who has more recently proved his acting talent with Silver Linings Playbook, ever degraded himself by linking his name to a loser like this."
1,Please Dear God No,I only spent a buck on this movie so I can't complain too much but this was the worst movie I have seen in some time.Sandra's character is so flat and annoying that you never believe in her and want her to find happiness. When she goes on a blind date with Steve the scene is so painful its hard to watch. Why anyone would be rooting for this pysco to get the guy is beyond me. The news stories that they scatter throughout the movie to qualify as a plot are all very bad jokes. Steve's character seems to have no redeming value and neither does anyone in the TV business in this movie.Save your time and money and watch any other movie on the self.
4,Bullock and Church make it worth watching,"There are a few things I didn't like about this movie; for one, the Southerners in the movie are portayed as yahoos and the ending was somewhat absurd. Ignore these weaknesses and watch it anyway. Don't let those flaws stop you from watching it. It's still an outstanding movie. Sandra Bullock was terrific as a talkative crossword puzzler writer and Thomas Haden Church was great as the self-centered news anchor. Bradley Cooper, while not quite as good, does a fine job as the reporter who likes Bullock a lot less than she likes him. Their performances save the movie."
3,"Just Average, expected more from a movie starring Sandra.","This was just an average movie for me, neither good or bad in my opinion. I'm a major Sandra B. fan, she is one of my favorite actresses and I guess I never really felt that she fit this part. I'm so accustomed to her playing roles that are more in depth, where you are able to connect with her on a more emotional level. Seeing her playing this part really never settled well with me. She was super intelligent but a complete air head at the same time.........just didn't sit right with me. I think it would have been better if someone with a personality more along the lines of Brittany Murphy's played the lead role. God rest her soul. What I love about Sandra wasn't present in this movie."
2,Love the red boots.,"All About Steve is a dumb, unfunny film about a lonely stalker played by Sandra Bullock. Bradley Cooper is a nice piece of eye candy but it's Bullock who holds this train wreck together. Bullock didn't deserve the Razzie Award for Worst Actress, she is so cute and her comic timing is her ""ace in the hole"". Bullock really tries to make the most of a very messy script. All About Steve is just not worth raving about."
3,Not that Bad,"After all the Razzie Awards for this film I was expecting the worst. Though I can't recommend this movie because more stuff doesn't work than does, it was entertaining enough to watch. A unique story and a talented cast just doesn't fully click. I don't think this is Sandra's best work, but she was fun as a very quirky character. I would rent this one before thinking of buying."
3,So So,It was watchable but not one of my favorites although I do like Sandra Bullock. She of course played her part well but it just was ok for me.
2,Average,"There was nothing special about this movie except Sandra Bullock, as usual. The story was boring, I'm not a Bradley Cooper fan, but he didn't even perform up to his usual level. If nothing else on, this is good for killing and hour and half, and Sandra is fun to watch, even in bad movies"
2,not funny,The movie is really not as funny as I expected so I was more than a little disappointed after watching it.
4,Great condition,This movie is one of my mom's favorite (I know what your thinking) and so I got it for her for Christmas. The movie arrived quickly and in fair condition.
1,Huh?,"What is the gist of this book? What little I've read of it, I find the ramblings of a demented and deluted mind... I'll continue to read more, but sheesh... Chapter 21 makes the claim that everyone who gets to Heaven - no matter the race or nationality on Earth - are white!This comes from a chapter about the lack of race prejudice in Heaven because - get this - there are no Black faces in Heaven!pg. 60: ""Oh,"" he said, ""we are all white here and in de perfect image of de Lord.""Wow. Really? Wow.Don't buy this book."
4,"Very Good, but theres better","The subhumans are incredible, but this album, keep in mind, is their first full legnth with a very raw in your face sound. If you liked this... buy From The Cradle To The Grave. Its one of my all time favorite records. From The Cradle... really shows their terrific musicianship and great songwriting. In my mind, From The Cradle... is a Anarcho Punk equivilent to Dark Side Of The Moon. Go pick that one up, as well as this."
5,Great cd if you like music thats politicaly charged,"I love this music. Unlike a lot of other punk (which i also love), this music tends to have a very deep meaning. I could classifiy it as almost ""satirical"". At first i didn't like the SubHumAns a lot, but after reading their lyrics i grew to love them. It was an aquired taste."
4,SubHumAns,"If you like the Sex Pistols,you will like SubHumAns.Imagine ""Anarchy in the U.K."" except calm,and you have SubHumAns.Buy this cd."
1,please stop making music,First of all i love punk music. I like everything from Dead Kennedys to the Clash to the Dammed. I like british punk music. But am i the only person who realizes how much this cd sucks. Black and White can't save the whole cd. It is the only good song they ever wrote. i bought it because i heard it was there best LP. I hope i never have to hear there worst album. This is crap and who ever likes it should listin to new music.
1,Be careful,"I bought this for my boyfriend because he likes to take herbal suppliments. He has a stress problem and I thought this might help. The first day he tried it he came home in the worst mood ever. He never is like that. Becareful, may have opposite effect!"
5,Pleased with product,This product peforms as expected. It helps my wife with her mood her mood. It is recommended to at least give it a try.
3,"OK, but not sure it helps.","Seems to be ok but its more of a mind thing. If you feel it helps, it probably does and vice versa. Not using any more"
1,What is this thing?,It was a big mistake to buy this product! I have not seen any benefit! well after reading again what it needs to do may be it was not right thing to expect all those things!
5,I love it worth the price,works great and it's a great price got it a great timing as well so I would defidently recommend st Johns Wort
2,"Effective, but it caused me to lose hair :(","I took some form or another of Nature's Way St. John's Wort for over a year. It was very effective for helping to treat the ongoing dysthymia/depression I suffered after some major life changes. However, if one is at all prone to hair loss, avoid this product. I once had very thick hair, but it has been thinning on top for the past year. It started about a month after I began using this product. I assumed it was another bout of telogen effluvium (something I experienced after losing 50 pounds), but it had continually gotten worse. I did some research, and discovered that St. John's Wort has been shown to cause hair loss. Sadly, my hair is an absolute mess compared to what it used to be. I'm now on biotin, silica, and lots of protein treatments to help protect what I still have. Hopefully, my hair will start growing back in soon.Update 1/23/13:Happily, my hair is growing back! Woohoo! At least the loss is reversible."
2,filter for vaiable speed pump,"This filter was recommended by Hayward and x-10 as a fix for the electronic noise the Hayward ecostar pool pump produces that interferes with x-10 wireless modules. Even though the filter is advertised as 220v, it only filters one leg (110v). If you need to filter both 220v legs you have to buy two filters with no guarantee that it would work. Never-the-less, it would only provide sporatic filtering capabilities when the pump ran at low speeds and none at higher speeds. Essentaily useless for this application."
3,stopped working after four weeks,"It stopped working four weeks after I purchased, started saying 'no disc' even though the disc is present, the customer support is not as fast as other customer support, thank god it was under 90 day warranty service but I had to shed 10 bucks for shipping to get repaired from the Mustek warranty support.The picture quality and sound quality are good, that's the reason I am giving 3 stars, but is delicate. Also few discs I was not able to play in this play but was able to play in my other DVD player."
4,War and loss driving Hecuba mad.,"Hecuba was the wife of Priam, King of Troy, and the mother of Hector, Paris, Cassandra, and others. At the start of this play of Euripedes, the war between the Greeks and Troy is over and Hecuba is now a slave of Agamemnon. The ghost of Achilles had appeared and demanded a sacrifice over his tomb before the Greeks can set sail for home. They vote to sacrifice Polyxena, Hecuba's young daughter, despite the tears and entreaties of Hecuba. After Polyxena's noble death, Hecuba learns that her last child Polydorus had been murdered by the King of Thrace, Polymestor, to whom Polydorus had been sent for safe keeping. This finally drives Hecuba mad and she seeks vengence for Polydorus's death. Euripedes shows in this play the effects of war and vengence on innocent lives and how cruel men at war can be."
4,Good learning tool!,The Snap it up game keeps my son focused on the game while we are playing it. I bought the multiplication version of this and it has helped tremendously. For my son and myself.
2,"Not as good as ""Tang"" by Mian Mian","While this novel holds a modicum of literary value, it simply pales in comparison to Mian Mian's genre creating work. Of course, this catagory, referred to as 'beauty writers,' would not exist if authors such as Wei Hui failed to tag along. In that regard, 'Shanghai Baby'deserves accolades. It provides impetus to a style of writing that deserves most of the attention it recieves. However, it is best to begin at the beginning, and that beginning is 'Tang'(sometimes translated as 'Candy' or 'Sugar') by Mian Mian."
5,Great simple and honest book,"This is a really great book that can take you out of your daily life to remember why we have to live awake in all our senses.Passion, death, love, pain, and Shangai getting into our veins as if we were there.Fascinating book. I do strongly recommend it."
4,"Reliable, easy to use","I've used this pump for 5 years pushing water 200+ feet up a hill, with no problems at all. Although lower in output, this pump is MUCH easier to use than the gas-driven pump it replaced. You do have to prime it well."
4,Good Pump Poor Packaging,"I hooked the pump up over our irrigation ditch in june and used it to power four impact sprinklers 200 feet away - little change in elevation to overcome. I saw a pump with the exact same shape and power rating with a different brand on it at Lowes for $20.00 more, so the price I paid was a plus. I would be exceptionally pleased except the pump arrived with the stand it sits on bent. There was padding on top of the pump in the box it was sent in but none on the bottom of the pump. The left side of the frame was bent up and made it difficult to attach the machine to the wooden frame I built over the ditch. Not a well thought out shipping process.Addendum - I pumped out of the ditch all summer 8-10 hours a day and in spite of silt in the water, it remained totally reliable till I shut it down in October.Be sure to power this bad boy with at least 14 gauge extension cords - it will overheat if you don't."
5,Utility Pump for pumping lake water.,The pump came in very good time and was well packed and in good (new) condition. The pump has been used to pump lake water to wash down my boat dock and elevated sundeck. It delivers very good flow and hydrostatic head for pumping water vertically 13'-0 to the 2nd level sundeck.
4,"Wayne Lawn Sprinking Pump works well, with proper setup",The Wayne #PSL100 Lawn Sprinking Pump works well when properly set up. However care must be taken to ensure that the suction hose doesn't have too much volume which will make it hard to prime or too much flow resistance (too small a diameter or too long)which causes poor pumping performance at the pump outlet.
1,Don't buy,"I bought one of these pumps last winter but did not get to try it out till this summer. After trying to get it primed for about an hour it finally spit out a little water, and I mean a little. If you have to put it in a creek or pond make sure the bank is not higher than 5 feet because it will pump enough water to run a sprinkler. All this pump is good for is running a small fish pond."
1,Not much utiilty to this pump,"Pump works great, but only for 4 minutes at a time before the thermal overload switches it off. Calls to Wayne technical support resulted in suggestions that the pump cannot be run off an extension cord (must have >115V under load, which it did), or in the sunlight (same problem in the shade). Nothing to do but return it and hope to find something more dependable and better-engineered."
2,Beware of quality,Very poor head; requires filling the priming port every time - which is a real pain. After 6 months (6 uses) it stopped working altogether. I wouldn't recommend this pump to anyone.
3,Wayne Pump,"Positive - Great pump, plenty of horsepower, great looking if you like the stainless look, and a great price.Negative- pump must be covered if you're keeping it outside, otherwise warranty will be voided. This is not in the website description, but in the package when you receive it, and if you are unhappy about this as we were when we received it - there is a 50% restocking fee for returning,also not in the website description- think about it before you buy it!!"
4,Works well,"These items work well, but like all x10 stuff, it is subject to interference when other transformer based items are on the same circuit. does not dim. Also- the prices are all over the place, from $15 to $50(!). SHOP AROUND."
5,A Must-Have for Fans of Richter and of Great Pianists,"This set contains recordings of Bach, Bartok, Beethoven (including Pathetique and Appassionata), Chopin, Franck, Glazunov, Mussogsky, Myakovsky, Prokofiev, Rachmaninov, Rimsky-Korsakov, Saint-Saens, Schubert, Schumann, Scriabin, and Tchaikovsky. The recordings were made from 1952- 1995 by Melodiya. Although the sonic quality of the older recordings is obviously not up to today's standards, the musicality is still there. Notes include some insight into Richter's background, training, and relationship with each composer's music."
2,Thrive workout,I am not that impressed with this DVD. The production seems a bit second rate. An ok workout if you can get pasted the amateurishproduction level
2,Nice mill but....,I got this for my husband who has wanted one forever!! After the first week we noticed dis coloring along the bottom and the finish was flaking off??? It was not wet nor had it gotten wet. This was just from sitting on the counter. Disappointed.
2,Cheap quality,"You get what you pay for which is kind of what I figured before purchasing. I was just looking for a cheap little tank to get for a desk. When it arrived, the sides were very scratched up by the transparent plastic cover (that when set up sits underneath the black cover you see pictured). Scratches, eh, who cares, but they were prominently in the front and very visible. The light switch didn't work... it would turn the light on but then immediately go out. Seemed like a bad switch since it would only stay on if you were actively pushing it into the ""on"" position. Ended up sending it back.The shape, by the way, is triangular. I don't think that that's clear in the description."
1,The CHEAPEST TANK ON THE MARKET,"I have gone through two tanks already and my Beta has yet to make it to enjoy one of them. Each time I receive this product it is cracked and the packaging is ALWAYs beat up. I have never been disappointed with anything I bought from Amazon but THIS IS A FIRST!!!! BOO ON YOU!!! Poor Beta, she will eventually get a good home :("
2,Save your money,You get what you pay for. I thought this was a neat tank for the price. However the material is cheap and looks scuffed when you get it.
2,Overpriced and a rip off.,"I got this at walmart for $10. There isn't any filter. A filter plate, but no filter. I checked the box before i even checked out to make sure everything was there, everything was included. The filter is simply a plate that I'm supposing is supposed to push out air from the bubbler. The bubbler is flimsy and doesn't stay down. The air rock keep floating up through the pipe thingy, no matter what I do. It's quiet-ish i guess. I dont really mind loud humming noises, so i wouldnt know. I don't use the bubbler, because i have a betta and bettas dont like currents."
4,Aquarius 1 Gallon,Buy it!!! When I ordered mine off Amazon I thought it was going to be a lot smaller and less quality. It actually looks really nice when you set it up and have everything going. I would recommend any one to buy this item. My fish loves the tank. It's worth the money.
4,Take note on fish care beforehand.,"I got this tank for my sweet little boy betta. Now yes it is not a super excellent tank HOWEVER it is not as bad as you think. Remember proper conditioners and heaters. Flat, round shaped heater will not fit however I got around this by putting the tank on some paper risers and slipped the heater UNDER the tank. Now this being only one gallon you will need to change water EVERY OTHER DAY (How much is up to personal choice and research.)Now Betta fish are sensitive to water motion, I put the filter tube end just about the water, it makes very little motion if any and I only turn it on for a short period of time to add oxygen to the water. (Plus my betta watches the bubbles and makes some of his own afterward.)My Betta lives happily in this tank, warm, well feed and loved. So you can raise and keep a betta in this tank, just know your betta care beforehand."
2,not a very decorative look for an aquarium,"This tank is usable, The light at the top made my water quite warm, the filter is barely enough to be considered a filter and in my opinion its not really a very pretty looking tank all around, you have to move to the right or left to get a good look at everything in it. really its usable, but i plan on switching to the half moon tank, it just looks a lot nicer and the sponge filter i have in this tank will work fine in it. Not the most glamorous looking tank if you ask me. hope that helps :)"
1,It was broken,It was broken and didn't work properly. I was quite disappointed and had to purchase another from the store. :(
1,Too bad it wasn't a 120 day warranty...,"Looking for a cheap setup for a ""school project"" fish. The tank itself is sound (no leaks) and the light is still working, but after 119 days the pump stopped working. It gets power, and it still makes noise, but it DOES NOT pump air. It wasn't dropped or damaged, had never been wet or covered in dirt/dust, and was plugged into a surge protector for its whole lifespan. Of course, with a 90 limited warranty my only option was to get a new pump (which luckily I had from an old slightly more expensive setup- it still works despite being used for 3 years then sitting idle for two). I would give 2 stars, because the other parts were OK, but without a working pump (or having to buy a separate one) it is not worth buying. So I guess the moral of the story is you get what you pay for..."
3,You get what you pay for,"Our guppies had babies and we needed a little tank. It has served its purpose and we are still using it. I would have the point (front angle) of the tank go back into a corner of our bathroom counter but all the tubes direct to the other side (I didn't get the geometric shaping). Anyway, I think it does not cost much & is just fine."
4,Nice for the Price,"I purchased two of these for my children. They have been assembled and in their rooms since Christmas and we have had no problems with the tanks or accessories. For the price, this is a great buy. My kids have Betas and one will fit nicely in this tank.When we opened the packaging, there were quite a few accessories that needed to fit in the tank. We were unsure how to assemble the air pump, airline tubing and under-gravel filter. We turned to the instructions for help, but there was little to be found on the small instruction sheet that was included, so we basically had to ""figure it out"" on out own.The kit comes with everything you need to get the tank up and running. Ours did come with the bulb and plant. If you are looking for a starter kit or even a smaller permanent tank, this will work well for you."
1,Author Unqualifed,"There are a lot of books out there that try to help non-scientists understand Einstein's Theories of Relativity, and I've read a bunch of them. I've also devoted a lot of time to the study of Relativity, in all it's mathematical splendor, and believe I've reached a level of a competent 1st year Physics grad student.With regard to this book: Mr. Gibilisco explains things better than he understands them, and this book was obviously not proofed by a competent Physicist. So... read it at your own risk. If you aren't going to go further in this subject, his errors probably won't hurt anything, but if you are still deciding which book to buy... keep on looking."
1,Confusion unlimited,"This book is sadly misguided. The author not only does not understand relativity, but actually promulgates common misunderstandings as fact. For example: he says that even mathematically defined points, such as the point of intersection of moving straight lines, cannot exceed the speed of light. They can. Even worse, he says that there is no such thing as simultaneity in a distributed frame of reference. There is. He says the lack of simultaneity is due to the propagation delay of light. It is not. All these things are covered in any introductory text on Special Relativity. Reading this book will only mislead you. It was clearly never reviewed by a relativity physicist. It's sad that it was ever published."

3,"Great idea, mediocre execution","This is just the ticket if you have a failed a/c pulley bearing on a vehicle that you just want to keep on the road and don't want to spend cubic dollars on a new compressor. I would have given it 5 stars but the material quality seems suspect- time will tell. Also, before you tear your car apart make sure you have a 13/32"" drill bit on hand- one of the two holes was too small on the one I got. This item fit my '92 caprice 305, and I think it would fit any small block GM of that vintage even though it is only listed as fitting light trucks."
3,Hardcore punk to the foundation,"I saw these guys a year ago and heard they were broken up so I had to get this cd because to this day that is still one of my most favorite concerts. However the cd itself lacks some of the power of the live show, but the songs are still incredibly wicked."
4,Three dozen interesting essays,"Physicist and philosopher Freeman Dyson writes about science, scientists, politics, arms control, nature and humanity. Includes book reviews, biographical sketches, obituaries, book introductions, and more.Some of the pieces would be best enjoyed by physicists and scientists; most are very accessible. A few are incredibly profound.--Stefan Jones"
2,Ghastly Production,"If you close your eyes, it's not a bad Gotterdammerung. But then, why not buy an audio CD? Why do new productions of the Ring always have to have a novel ""interpretation?"" Are opera lovers so immature that they can't understand metaphors? While I have nothing against fellatio and copulation, do we need simulated sex to gain an understanding of Wagner? Run, don't walk to the nearest exit."
2,Continuing the Search....,"What have Michael Schulz, Renee Listerdal and Dirk Becker done? I had high hopes for a modernized staging of the end of the Ring Cycle, since I have only the Met's wonderful production from years ago on DVD. This set and costumes visually turns the opera into the equivalent of a cheap, low-budget, hole in the wall production. Fortunately, the orchestra under Carl St. Clair plays very well and most singers, particularly the three leads, are very good (many of the secondary singers are not up to par). The efforts of the leading singers, however, are nearly lost to this short-sighted concept. Modern opera directors often have brilliant ideas, but there were none here. Sorry, guys, this was a design and direction failure, not a good recipe for a DVD."
1,Misleading discription,"I intended to buy a cartridge of Stylus C80 compatable cyanink. Below the listing I checked out other items. This listingshowed a four cartridge set at significant discount. I checkeditem discription and technical data . I ordered thinking I was getting a set of all four colors for my printer. When I opened the package, I found four cartridges of Magenta. First I thoughtit was a shipping error. but the invoice was correct. IN NO PLACE DID THE LISTING SAY MAGENTA INK CARTRIDGES. NOT IN THEITEM DISCRIPTION OR TECHNICAL DATA. IT WAS ONLY BY UNDERSTANDING THE PRODUCT CODE THAT YOU WOULD KNOW THIS. I AM RETURNING THE ORDER AND CLOSING MY ACCOUNT!!"
2,Price increase is rediculous!,"When I used to by this product it would cost me 39.99 with no shipping. Now they go up to 42 -45.00, I don't know why. It is still the same price in the store. And in the store, I pay 38.88 plus tax for six cans, so why would I pay more on the net? I won't!!"
4,Quality Product,"We give the same brand probiotic to our horses, so we thought we'd try this for our aging Yorkie. The vet mentioned that his normal flora wasn't as healthy as it should be... so we got probiotic from him, before we found this online. It seems to keep our Yorkie from getting in ""ruts"" where he doesn't feel very good. He's spunky and happier than he has been in years! Will definitely continue to buy this product."
3,"Tongue-in-cheek, sometimes to the point of annoying","I bought this bok used based on the title. Being a fan of Raymond Chandler novels, I plunged ahead. While I found the bok fun to read, I can best describe the bok as ... cute.There were moments when I guffawed out loud, but mostly I just smiled in spots. Trouble was, some of the tongue-in-cheek humor kept distracting me because it was just too over-the-top. If villains with names like Sam Andelilah and Knightenday make you laugh, you will very much enjoy this book. If they make you cringe, you may want to pass this one by. For myself, I fall somewhere in the middle. Those kinds of jokes make me laugh--I am a Bond fan, after all (Tiffany Case, Moneypenny, etc.), but a little goes a long way...and this way was just too long or me.In my opinion, Surfing Samurai Robots wasn't a bad book...it was just not a great book either."
2,A very poor read; uninspired--this history is bunk...,"Keith Springer chairs the Bethel College History Department at Bethel College, Kansas. His copious attention to the mundane is an instant depressant. Here is yet another attempt to chronicle the history of the church in such a way as to forcefully arrive at preconceived conclusions. Keith Sprunger always fails to give the reader the appropriate depth that comes with a concept of social setting. There is not one anectdote to recommend. Sprunger gives no dimension to an exhausted paradigm."
2,"A ""Blind Lane"" at Amsterdam","""PD from Wildwood NJ"" could not have written it better! But I protest and quietly resign Sprunger as another ""intellectual historian"" writing for himself. Reform, renewal and religious ferment seem is what Keith Sprunger is good at--I should know...because I have endured ""The Meeting of Dutch Anabaptists and English Brownists"" from ""The Contentious Triangle."" ""KEITH L. SPRUNGER ('62) is Oswald H. Wedel Professor of History at Bethel College (Kansas). He presented ""The Printing Press and the Reformation of Religion,"" in Paris in 1997, and he published ""Puritan Church Architecture and Worship in a Dutch Context"" in Church History (March, 1997).""--History at Illinois"
4,Wonderful book!,If you love horses and if you don't you sure will love horses after reading this book.Loved this book!
1,The Horses of Proud Spirit,"Melanie Sue Bowles is one of the kindest people it has been my pleasure to meet. The care and love that she and her husband, Jim, selflessly and continually shower on the horses, ponies, donkeys, and numerous dogs at Proud Spirit is heartwarming. Since moving to their beautiful location in the Oachitah Forest of western Arkansas from Florida along with all of the animals, their reputation continues to grow. The Horses of Proud Spirit is a very touching tribute to the animals, past and present, that have had the good fortune to have been rescued by Mel and Jim. I am looking forward to more stories from this gifted writer."
2,A book by someone who knows little about horses,"The author repeatedly displays her ignorance of horses in almost all respects, even though she has been around a lot of horses. If you know something about horses, especially horses with ""problems"", you will find her stories to be alarming (because of her lack of understanding of horses) and you will proably wonder how it ever got recommended by anyone with any knowledge of horses.Although she is well intentioned and is to be comended for saving horses, given her ignorance and dangerous behavior around horses it is a wonder she has not gotten severely injured or killed by now."
1,Get Lost,"This book contains some of the most inaccurate route descriptions in the history of guide books. The milage makes no sense by any known system of measurement. I might go so far as to say this book could get you killed, especially in the Grand Canyon. It's as if the whole thing were written using only lo-resolution maps, with no accounting for topography. I find it hard to believe the author actually took any of these hikes. If anybody does ever see him on a trail, though, kick him square in the nuts for me and my friends who had to suffer for his incompetence."
1,Too much talk,"Lots of talk, poor interviewer, limited music, short duration, recorded in 1994, save your money !"
1,one of the books that degrades madonna and is not accurate,i received this book saturday and all it does it make fun of and critisize madonna who in my opinion is the best artist of all time with the best music i've ever heard. it is not accurate with the information about her either. this one of the worst books on her that i have read. I would not reccomend it at all.
5,This is one book that everybody should have!!!,"This book is an excelent example of Ann Martin's writing abilities. The plot catches your attention right away, and you feel as if you're there. You begin to sympathize with the so-called sixth grader ""witch"" and sit on on the edge of your seat because of Abby's bad luck. While reading, the author unearths suspects whom may have stolen the Witche's Eye, but there's no way to tell intill the end because of the plot's interesting aspects on the suspects. All fans of Ann Martin should definately read this fantastic view of the mystery in Salem. And if you've never read a book by Ann Martin, this is definately a great place to start!!!"
1,A total waste of time,This exam review is full of errors and does not give a good preparation for the test. I was spending more time reconciling their errors than focusing on prep for the test. Their solutions are vague and incomplete and their equations do not match with the FE supplied reference handbook. I ended up going back to original textbooks for better understanding. Just remember you get what you pay for.Good luck on the exam and use Lindeburg's 1001 Solved Engineering Problems for a better prep. Couple that with his EIT reference manual and you are all set.
3,Application for Engineering Students,The book provides some good reference material for helping students understand how to prepare for the exam. Perhaps it would be good as a supplemental class text.
5,My favorite Veggie Tales Video!!!,"I'm a high school Junior, and my teenage brother, my friends, and my boyfriend all LOVE Veggie Tales.. and this is my favorite one! It's a clever remake of the classic Good Samaritain story, with GREAT songs, and adorable animations. A great gift, for your kid... or you!"
3,"Cheesier than most Veggies, lacks substance","Our 22-month old loves all things Veggie, but this one gets on my nerves. It tells the story of the Good Samaritan in a trivial way. Seems to be saying, ""Love those who are different,"" without saying why. I know the creators are capable of doing better --- they did much much better with ""Josh & the Big Wall,"" my favorite Veggie of all. Pass on this one and get Josh."
5,A Novel of Substance,I felt is was a gripping and powerful read that held me in Intrigue and suspense. A book that could be enjoyed by Christians and non Christians alike. I would not hesitate to recommend it to my friends.
4,well worth the price,I bought this dvd at wm for a little over $10. You may not know some of the cartoons. But that don't matter to my 2 yr old grandson. To me it is well worth the $10 I payed for it
3,WATCH MANY CARTOONS FOR LITTLE MONEY,"If you like many, many, many old cartoons from Hollywood's golden era drifted into ""Publicdomainland"", you will surely like this pack (I enjoyed it). But if you like to watch old cartoons in good prints, or at least in passable prints, then, though you still would like it, forget it! (There are some things in good prints, but these are the very minority)Apart from the aforementioned, this mega-pack also contains some avoidable TV entries (1950s-80s) and many, many unclassified rarities from around the world (even not animated)."
5,A great collection for today's kids,"This is a great collection of good oldtime kid's entertainment. You can't go wrong; 12 discs filled with cartoons from the 30's, 40's, etc. Most of which you won't find on TV today. And you can't beat the price. These sell elsewhere for thirty bucks I paid $9.99 at Amazon."
5,"Heavy, Quality Cables","Monster cables have always lasted for me (still have one from 12 years ago). These particular cables are heavy duty, and provide great quality. If they're anything like the old ones, I'll probably have mine for quite some time."
5,Woman's Heart 2,I think this album rates up there with the first compilation released a decade ago. The stand out track is Poison Tree by Marcia Howard and Mary Black and it is clear to see why it was lifted as the first single. It is a fine collaboration by two outstanding singers and signifies the powerful forces at work within this album. If you only buy one c.d. this year make sure it's this one and if you have any change left over buy the single for your best friend. This is music as real as it gets.
3,Use for the dog,"I use 1/2 pill daily for my dog along with glucosamine.Seems to be working fine. For the cost per use, can't beat it."
5,nice quality,"This is designed with an offset on the mounts and 4 screw holes that make the placement quite adjustable. If you are replacing a broken latch, that could be a handy feature to allow you to use the same original screw holes. It comes with mounting screws. The plate has little bumps on it so that when you mount it with only one screw it keeps the plate from turning once it is tightened down. The magnet/plates part seems to be of high quality. It does have a wood grain look to it, something I did not notice when I purchased, but did not matter to me as these were used on garage cabinets. The price is good, I bought three, and they all worked well."
4,"Its a pretty good video,.","This is a good video for a beginner, a very complete guitar method, so put your chair in front of the TV, plug in your guitar and keep hitting rewind!"
1,Very poorly reproduced,"This product is very poorly produced. The titles on the dvds don't match the episodes, picture quality is poor. Order the real ones instead by Mpi."
3,mystery better than the play,"The upper class New York lush Nick is backwith his wife rich Nora and they have a one year old boy.They seem more like a bored rich couple in middle agethan a newly married young couple.The mystery is the murder of Nora's father's partnerwho runs the family business.A lot of gangsters and criminals are introducedfor interest, but the real murderer is all upper class?Nick is rapidly becoming an alcoholic andNora is worried about keeping him interested in her.I see liver problems in their future.I liked the movie."
1,A Big Disappointment,"I generally love old, black-and-white movies, but I'll make an exception with this one. Both of us gave up after about an hour trying to make sense out of this movie. Poor, wooden acting and even lousier directing made it very painful to watch."
4,Third Thin Man Film Offers Complex Mystery & Plenty of Wit,"Although MGM continued to soften the characters of Nick and Norah Charles from the sharp-edged original (in this particular film the couple has a baby and Nora is described as no longer drinking), Powell and Loy retain their sparkle as a team and the script offers plenty of opportunity for them to shine.This particular film concerns Norah's financial manager, well played by C. Aubrey Smith at his most crusty, who is being threatened by a former business associate--and no sooner is Nick on the case than murder results. As in the previous ""Thin Man"" films, ANOTHER THIN MAN sports a remarkable cast: in addition to C. Aubrey Smith, there are extremely enjoyable performances from Marjorie Main, Ruth Hussey, Muriel Hutchison, Sheldon Leonard, and Abner Biberman. Every one is sure to enjoy the fun, particularly when Nora takes a hand by investigating a nightclub and both Nick and Nora meet Marjorie Main's ""Mrs. Dolley."" Recommended."
3,Should be more like 3 1/2 Stars,"The Thin Man series is still great to watch. This one has Sheldon Leonard in it, who produced, directed, acted and wrote for film and TV (Danny Thomas Show; Dick Van Dyke, Andy Griffith etc.). Also, C. Aubrey Smith, a great ol' character actor is in it. Good murder mystery with the two Thin Man greats: William Powell and Myrna Loy. I periodically watch all six of these mysteries and still enjoy them each time; one in the series, not this one, stars a very young Jimmy Stewart."
4,For anyone interested in long term real estate trends,"This book purposes a very interesting prediction, for future migration patterns in the US, based upon the author's interpretation of historical trends. I think this book provides much food for further research and is an insightful read for anyone interested in long term real estate trends."
5,Essays on doctrine,"There are brief essays on Christian doctrine throughout the edition, all written by J.I. Packer, in his wonderfully lucid style, which help understand the many points of theology from the creation, incarnation, resurrection, eschatology, and everything in between. These, combined with the study notes written by various theologians, are a short course in Christian doctrine from the Reformed point-of-view. They take into account extra-Biblical sources, as well. In addition, the poetry of the King James translation is greatly satisfying to read."
5,WITHOUT QUESTION ... THE BEST!!,"I give this book a 10++! It is the most balanced and liberated view on divorce and remarriage that I have ever read! As a Bible School graduate, I can say that the book is not only Theologically sound, but a pleasure to read as well. I have given away several books to divorced friends of mine and they all loved it!"
1,Sets a new standard for tedium,"If you've ever wondered what a Victorian set piece is, look no further. This one is so creaky it's got cobwebs on it's red velvet curtains. I knew Stoker was an embarrassment to British literature when I first tried reading Dracula. The prose are awkward and overwrought, the dialog dull and dreary, the plot progression as slow as an average Conan Doyle story.Want some crazy good reads from the era? Wilde's Dorian Gray and Stevenson's Dr. Jekell & Mr. Hyde penetrate to the heart of late 19th c decadence with all the social, philosophical and psychological frames of reference a literate and informed reading public could desire.As for this loser, the previous review said it best: a resounding and crashing bore."
4,"Good, not as good as Dracula","Definitely not as exciting as Dracula, but this one is still a must have for Bram Stoker fans.I enjoyed it immensely, the ending however was a little unexpected. All in all it is a a great book from the master of horror."
1,"Good watch, poor quality","I like(d) the watch. This is my second watch of this model, the first one needed expensive battery change so I was excited to buy this, which runs on light. Unfortunately, after a year or so, the crown came off! I turned it to adjust the date and it just came off."
2,Incorrect sizing,Just received my order and I was totally shocked at the size of this watch. I was expecting a fairly good size watch (48mm case diameter) and its not! It might be a 38mm!
4,nice watch,"only had it for a short time, but it seems like a great watch. chronograph is only in min/sec increments (no tenths), so if you're looking for that you'll be disappointed. stays at the ""LV1"" charge-level most of the time, but will sneak up to ""LV2"" on a sunny day. haven't used the dive function (and don't really plan to). seconds hand is kinda small, but the 24-hr hand is a nice touch. bought this watch to replace my last citizen watch, which i purchased in january 1988 and finally retired it in march 2008, so i hope this one will last as long."
5,Excellent Book. A MUST HAVE for kids.,"This is a MUST HAVE book for any toddler.The colors are bright and the illustrations are funny. This alone keeps my son's attention. The repitions make it easy for my son to remember and help me ""read"" the book.Sometimes we play this as a game at the park. My son will start 'hopping' like a bunny and I'll tell him to hop like a kangaroo, horse and fish. He'll stop and say ""nooooo, fish hop"". I think it's fun and so does he."
5,"A great, great book","This is a wonderful book that my children have loved from the first reading. The illustrations are fun and colorful and there is just enough text. Much to my surprise, my two year old was able to recite some of it after just a few readings, she liked and connected to it that much. It would be a great gift for any child you know. I heartily recommend it."
4,Structured Cobol Book,"The book was in very good condition. The delivery was a little slow. The vendor, Woody's Book, sent an email inquiring if I had received the book. When I responded that I had not, the vendor took action to get the book to me as quickly as possible. This was most appreciated. I feel the vendor was proactive and provided good service."
3,Does not work on Windows NT/2000,"I got a version of this software recently and found that it won't work on Windows NT/2000. This is listed in the system requirements, but I wasn't careful enough to notice it."
1,Frustrating product,After weeks of trying to print blank checks with this product and after noticing that my bank was unable to record some check numbers.. finally the realization that ONLY LASER PRINTERS USING MAGNETIC INK can print checks. The instructions refer to but do not limit to those requirments. FOR LASER PRINTERS ONLY should be prominantly displayed On box. What a waste of time and money. ..
1,doesn't fit,"Didn't fit my car, didn't fit my boyfriends truck....Not sure where it would ""help"" but it didn't help the Chevy S10 Pickup truck UNLESS there was a load... if empty, they had to be removednot worth the money"
4,Enchanted,"I have 5 volumes of the HOW TO DRAW series. This one is a good reference book if you want to try your hand at drawing. Beginners will find it a challenge to ""copy"" a given picture following the step by step instructions. Artists with some experience will find the hints and a glance at the techniques used helpful. I'll give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it's made a bit soulless, I'd have expected more heart and soul to a booklet like that but I guess that's not possible in a huge company."
5,Loving God with all our mind.,"This little book offers a big, big challenge: to evaluate our understanding of this portion of the greatest commandment - not only loving Him with all of our heart and soul, but with our mind as well (as we are commanded!) - & to apply it to our reading, our education &, most importantly, to the education of our children. Is that happening? Read on!"
2,JOURNEY,"THE BOOK ARRIVED WITHOUT A JACKET COVER, WAS SLIGHTLY WARPED AND SMELLED MOLDY I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE QUALITY OF THRE BOOK SHIPPED"
2,Causing a rash,"My daughter sleeps in these at night for potty training purposes but since we started using this brand her bottom has broken out. Not sure what the ""Feel N Learn"" part is made of but it reacts badly with her bottom. We are getting rid of the rest of these and switching to a different brand."
1,AWFUL,"These are a cheap knock off of Huggies Pull-Ups. And once the side comes apart, you can't put it back together like with Pull-Ups. Over all a waste of money. Just use Pull-Ups, they're worth the extra money..."
3,"Ok, but nothing great","I thought I'd try these after my daughter started using the potty more often in an attempt to move away from diapers altogether. I found these to be ok but not any better than Easy Ups. As others have mentioned, my daughter never commented on feeling wet any more than with diapers or Easy Ups. If you just like the convenience of pulling something up instead of diapering, try Easy Ups first. They're cheaper and just as good as these in my opinion."
1,Diaper Review,This product rips easy and does not have the velcro like the huggies comparitive. The diaper seem to be cheaply made. The price was way more then the value out of these diapers.
5,Look great in my kitchen!,"We had these same cabinet pulls in my old house, where I grew up. I always loved them and when I started re-doing my own home, I looked high and low for the same door pulls. I finally found them and you can't imagine my surprise! I am doing my kitchen in vintage farmstyle and these go wonderfully with my copper farm style sink and add the perfect touch!"
5,No recount needed...Greenfield has a winner!,"Jeff Greenfiled writes an insightful, intelligent and very witty recollection of the bizarre events surrounding the 2000 Presidential election. What a treat to see it through his eyes! He has a front row seat and lucky for us, he takes us along on this incredible journey. He writes fluidly and manages to make a page turner out of events in which the reader already knows the outcome! While the rest of the media kept telling us how tired they all were, Greenfield emphasizes the fact that this was new territory for even the most seasoned media professionals and that they all had to step up their game just to stay in it. A fantastic read!"
3,"This ""Crow"" Needs a Little Ketchup","If you like Jeff Greenfield, and I do, you'll probably like this book. If you like the way he puts words together, and I do, you'll probably like this book. If you can't get enough political coverage, and I can't, you'll probably like this book.All in all, ""Crow"" is 200 pages of witty, inciteful, personal experience concerning the 2000 presidential election. Unfortunately, the book is 300 pages long. It just ran out of gas after 200 pages. I had the same problem in school when I had a 1000 word assignment, but only 600 words of information. I think that's why I recognized the situation.I enjoyed the book, but I'm glad it was a present. I didn't spend my own money for it."
3,"well, it could be worse.","Greenfield refers to this book as a ""memoir on the run"" of the wacky 2000 presidential election. ""Memoir on the run"" is correct...it feels like it was written in a hurry; like a term paper banged out on a word proceesor the day before it was due.Nevertheless, there are a couple of good yuks, and some decent analysis on the election. I would warn you though, that it's a bit self-centered at times. I'm sure someone will write a better book, or (heaven forbid) the made for tv movie will be next, but in the meantime, Greenfield's tome will just have to do"
5,A GREAT INVESTMENT!,"This cd is a true gift. Rod Stryker leads three meditations that quiet your mind and put you in a place of witness. Pick one and work with it awhile or mix them up. All are around 20 minutes long, so they really fit into the busiest of schedules. Rod is not only a great yoga teacher but a God send with this cd!"
5,Great for teachers interested in enhancing their students' learning experience,"Highly recommend for teachers - it offers a lot of ideas for creating projects that enhance learning while also helping students improve other critical skills such as communication, teamwork, research, presenting, etc..Easy to read. Lots of great suggestions."
1,Poor quality,"I purchased this GO board with high hopes, but when I opened it I immediately decided I needed to return it.I found that the picture of the board is misleading. It does not clearly show that the top of the board is a 1/8"" applied top. Instead the pictures make the board look solid. Ok, that in itself was not a deal breaker.The worst part was that a significant number of the lines on the board were smudged. Not just a few, but most. This factor alone made the board ugly, while a GO board needs to be beautiful and pleasing to the eye. Also, all four corners of the top were slightly damaged.I was very disappointed.The good thing is that Amazon makes the return process extremely easy!"
2,Unsuitable,"A go board that is unusable is not a good deal at any price.First of all, the merchants clearly don't care about the game. The stones should be placed on the lines, not the spaces in between as in the photo. This shows a complete lack of clue about the game of GO. A major clue that you don't want this.Second, Go stones for a board of this size are hard to use over the course of a long game. Kids will give up in frustration. I have several go-bans at this size, and I can attest they are unsuitable for over the board play.You can buy a roll-up board and stones kit with regulation 8mm stones for about this same price. Your fingers will thank you. Kids will actually use it."
4,great design,Great game to play and with the drawers to hold the pieces is a life saver and space. Thanks for still selling GO
1,Poor quality,"This Go set (aka Weiqi) is of rather poor quality. The wood used is low-quality, which results in a lot of imperfections on the surface. The drawers are small and wiggle a lot and cannot be opened or closed easily due to poor construction. The chess pieces are a joke, really small and so flat on both sides that they're difficult to pick up! The single instruction sheet also erroneously states the game originated in Japan (it actually originated in China at least 3,000 years ago). I cannot recommend this set. You might have better luck at a local sporting goods or educational goods store."
3,issues,"the board is okay, but it is warped and smudged. the stones are under regulation size and are hard to handle, and they get stuck in the drawers easily. it is a good product though, so i would rate it 3 and 1/2 stars."
2,Poor quality!,"I have had THREE of these in the last year. All of them have broken (not physcially, but internally) and at least I got refunds on the first 2. The last I bought from a private seller because Amazon wisened up and decided not to sell this defective item anymore. The reason I've bought 3 is because it's the most comfortable design made for this phone. I hate the earbud design."
4,Nokia Boom Headset,The headset works well and stays connected to the phone (previous versions tended to pop out).
1,NEVER AGAIN.,"After receiving the bird food, I placed the food into an airtight plastic tub. Within a month, bugs hatched in the food and I had to throw out over half the bag. In over 20 years of use, I've never had a problem with this product. I contacted the seller to request remedy of some sort, and they did not reply. I would steer clear of them as they do not seem to stand behind their products."
5,exactly what I needed,The style and the color of this hinge matched exactly to the existing hinges I have in my kitchen and bathroom. None of the hardware stores in town had them. Received them in a very timely fashion.
3,A Nice Album Cover,"""A Collection of Oldies"" has a great picture on the back cover of the Beatles hanging out, ""having a laugh,"" maybe at Paul's house. The album contains the hits that weren't included on albums. If you have the English albums you needed this and the album ""Rarities"" to have a complete British Parlophone collection.The fidelity of the recordings themselves are really pretty bad. It sounds like they were dubbed from someone's well used record collection. The sound quality is not in line with the other English vinyl recordings."
2,Seeds of Time,"I love time travel stories but this one was hard to get into, and even harder to keep reading. I'm hoping the sequel will be better, I really want to give this author a chance."
5,Some Love Stories are Thrilling. This one is Terrifying,"A gothic set in California comes from the pen of Margaret Millar, wife of Ross MacDonald and one of the most clever and resourceful authors on the suspense genre.First published in 1950, tells the story of a young family spending the hot summer months as lodgers at the country house of a mysterious widow. She is the possessor of ""The Cannibal Heart"" of the title, and she will not stop at nothing to get what it desires. A husband and a child, even if it means murder. It's now on the hands of a well-meaning, ordinary woman to fight back, trapped in a living hell, to live or die for her loved ones and for herself.Read this book. You'll never forget it."
1,Disappointing pronounciation by a non-native speaker.,"Although the content of this tape was just what I was looking for, I was disappointed that it was narrated by a non-native Hebrew speaker with a thick American accent. Even as a beginning student of Hebrew my pronounciation is superior to that heard on the tape. In contrast, those tapes I've used by native speakers such as that by Mansoor have been excellent and instructive."
2,Cutesy and incomprehensible,"Unfortunately, I received only the 3-CD audio program, not the written companion volume, ""Supplement for Enhanced Comprehension."" Perhaps the latter would have helped, but I don't think so. I found the little mnemonic songs incredibly cloying -- the pretentious and idiotic musings of a bunch of Yalie turds who think they're OH SO CLEVER AND CUTE. The ""Hebrew Blues"" and little a capella takes on dik duk set to ""Frere Jacques"" wouldn't be so bad ... if they only taught something. The best of Debbie Friedman's stuff not only is catchy and beautifully performed, but leaves the listener with actual knowledge. This stuff was much more focused on amusing its creators. Worse, many of the songs are incomprehensible without the text -- like ""Words 1-99,"" in which different Hebrew words are simply spoken at random. Very disappointing."
1,Architecture residential drawing and design Workbook,The workbook is useless without the text book. It was unclear when ordering that I had ordered a workbook which had no information.
2,Many problems - Does not work with NT,"I was very disappointed when I first tried to install this product in that it WILL NOT work with Windows NT or 2000. I had to boot up the old Windows 98 machine to try it out. The user interface is one of the worst I've seen in a long time, requiring you to jump through many hoops just to get a check printed or designed. The help files are not very detailed. In fact there is some sort of ""check encryption id"" that is printed on each check and looks pretty cool, but there is no mention of what it is or how it works or how it improves the security of your check.On the positive side, it does seem to integrate with quickbooks, but again, only under windows 98.Also, this program does not print deposit slips like many of the other check printing programs. For the cost, it is not worth it. I will attempt to get a refund."
1,Nothing special,"I am sorry, but I cannot agree with the person from Houston (Hirsch's hometown). This book is pretty bad. The scheme of the book is forced, and the lecture series ""on love"" is just awful. All the famous people dredged up from the past sound like caricatures or like Hirsch. Overly academic and many times trite, this book is an example of how one's reputation can sometimes land you a book contract. If this book weren't written by Edward Hirsch, it wouldn't have been published, much less by Alfred Knopf."
1,Disappointing,"Edward Hirsch, once a better than average middle-voiced poet, has gone terribly wrong with ""On Love."" The lectures on love in the voices of the famous dead lie dead on the page, victims of their own grandstanding. (And I must say that the villanelle in the first section of the book is one of the clumsiest in recent memory.) No amount of complicated forms and co-opted voices can disguise that this book is misguided and flawed."
1,bad quality,The first night that I used them were green. I returned them and these was more expensive the return what the product price
1,3 big problems for me,"The program stores pictures in a proprietary format (*.pdd). It can take JPEG (and many other file formats) as input, but then saves in the photodeluxe format, which was 20X larger than JPEG format. Also this makes sharing pictures harder and uploading to a website harder. There was an export option to JPEG but I believe this was recompressing the picture, which can not be good for image quality.Also could not change where the program wanted to store pictures. I want to put pictures in a subfolder under my documents so I can do easier backups. But Photodeluxe doesn't have an option (that I could find) for using a directory other than the default of the program directory.Finally, the tools provided get to be a little tedious. The steps you have to go through for using a tool (e.g. redeye removal) are on several tabs of a dialog, so you have many extra clicks to get between tabs."
1,terrible,"run away, don't walk. i've nothing but problems w/ the prod. uses incredible amount of virtual memory/swap space. appear to have memory leak that causes it to get slower and slower over time in one session. always convert pic to its proprietary .pdd format. it's just pathetic. it's a shame Adobe makes this kind of crap. run away..."
2,2.0 is actually better than 4.0 !!!,"I got Photodeluxe 2.0 bundled with my Dell back in 1999 and loved the simplicity (still do). I got 4.0 with my Fuji camera and have noticed that they actually managed to make it worse(?).They did make a couple of improvements, but one feature they actually removed from the earlier version is unforgivable: when you enlarge, your image edges will become irrepairably distorted. The earlier version had an built in antialiasing feature that automatically smoothed edges when you deselected (clicked outside of the images box). Most image programs will auto-antialias and the fact that this doesn't barely puts it one notch above MS ""Paint""."
3,Great Product but no longer supported,"I've used this product for many years with great results. It's straightforward and easy to use. Sadly, Adobe stopped supporting it in 2002 and it will not run on the newer operating systems. I have on occasion gotten it to work on XP, but more often than not it crashes. Unless you're working on an older system, save your money. You're likely to be disappointed."
1,Bad News,"This product came bundled with my new scanner and I installed it 10 days ago on my 1.4 GHz PC, 512 MB RAM, running Windows 2000. At first the only problems I encountered were with slow image file opening, .pdd format as only option, and image file naming. Then attempts to launch the application on day 11 were met with errors messages related to the ""scratch disk being full"". I have 32 GB of available on the hard drive so this message is mystifying. So far I've downloaded online troubleshooting documentation, sent emails to customer support, called their toll-free and pay-as-you-go numbers for customer support -- all to no avail. Calls to their 900 number were either dropped or they couldn't find me or my product in their database. I've never had so many problems with photoprocessing application. My advice -- use something, anything else -- this product is bad news."
2,not great,"I have bought two adobe products, first 3.0. I liked it alot-easy and fun to use-UNTIL my computer kept crashing and when i took it in, the shop told me that the adobe had changed some windows settings and took out the program. All was well, so later that year bought adobe 4.0, thinking that perhaps the bugs were out! Wrong, same thing happened....I called adobe and they say that they had never heard of it before and were really quite rude. So now i will buy Picture it-hopefully microsoft will not disappoint me!"
3,Photodeluxe printing,"I got my copy of Photodeluxe 4.0 along with a Fuji FP2400 digital camera. Photodeluxe prints all shots in thumbnail size, no matter what I do, and cannot print four shots to a page. These are simple tasks using Paint Shop Pro. When I tried to register my copy of Photodeluxe I was told that the registration number was already in use, and that I would need to fax Adobe with proof of purchase. At that point I gave up.I think that the produce just about deserves three stars for manipulation of images, but the print problem and poor help prevents it achieving more."
3,"A good product, but Vista is not real happy with it","This is an excellent product for Windows XP and earlier systems. It does work with Windows Vista, but Vista is not real content with it. I forgot the messages I would get, just ignored it and the product works fine. I have no problems with it on my XP machine where I finally installed it and removed it from Vita"
4,"Simply to use, easy to retrieve photos from your computer","I received this software free with my scanner years ago and find it's simplicity a breath of fresh air. I don't have to upload to a special folder to work on photos unlike Photoshop 6.0. For the novice, this is a great user friendly piece of software. Too bad they strayed from it's simplicity when they upgraded and left this one to the archives."
1,"Yuk, YUK and more YUK",Got the product bundled with a Fuji digital camera. Have just installed it and and 2 days later uninstalled it. Adobe have seen the error of their ways and have dis-continued the product. Support runs out mid-2003. But no doubt it will continue to be bundled as a great gimme with digicams!Get almost anything else the proprietary .pdd format is memory/HDD hungry. I have yet to find anything else that even comes close to opening the files in this format.KEEP AWAY
2,Not that great,"Yoga Trance was a complete let down. The other two were OK but overall, I was not too happy with the collection. I guess I am NOT a beginner to Yoga and I was looking for something more intense..."
4,This is a tough ACNP exam review book,"I heard a lot of feedback from my classmates and professors about the toughness of this book. I used it for my ACNP exam preparation, and without a doubt, it is a tough book. However, this book make me realize the weakness areas of my knowledge base, so that I can focus on those area during the exam preapration. I feel more comfortable to take the exam after I utilized this book. I am so glad I passed my exam at the first time."
2,Bad brush roll!,"I've had this vacuum for a few years and I'm tired of spending money to replace its parts. The vacuum itself works well, but the brush roll has to be replaced every 6 months to a year. We went to a vacuum store and spoke with a man about it and he said it's typical of this model. The first two brush rolls we replaced just stopped spinning and wouldn't turn at all, even by hand. The third started making a loud vibration and eventually melted the side of the brush roll completely. Replacing it is at least $20 each time. They also recommend replacing the belt when you replace the brush roll, since it stretches the belt a bit when you take the brush roll on and off.Also the turbo brush didn't work for me. It's supposed to spin automatically when you use it with the hose, but the brush roll on it would only spin intermittently."
1,Tired of it breaking,This vacuum does a really good job of picking up dust and pet hair but the rollerbrush is garbage. It only lasts a few months and then falls apart. The roller isnot covered by the warranty and in 2 years of use it's cost me almost as much inreplacement rollers as I paid for the machine originaly. Also the power cord getswarm while in use which means the wire is undersized for the application.I would not recommend this model to anyone.
4,Bissell 3950 Velocity Bagless Upright Deep Cleaner,It works pretty well. Nothing works as good as the advertisment hype. My wife likes how easy it is to empty and that you can see when it is getting full. Watching the debris spin is a bit of entertainment to go along with a not terribly entertaining household chore.
1,why is this titled a deep cleaner when it's a vacuum???,why is this titled a deep cleaner when it's a vacuum??? this is misleading and a waste of a customer's time
3,Great for Carpet,"I bought the Bissell Velocity 3950 when my last Bissell's motor blew up (I had had that one for four years). I really like the air filter light that lets you know if you need to change the filter. I'm not very good at doing that (which is why my last one blew up) and this has a nice warning light to remind me.I LOVE what it does for my carpets. My husband says they have not this good since we moved in. I like in Oklahoma and we have that nasty red clay that gets everywhere. With two kids, my husband and my dog we put good wear on the carpet and this brings it back to life.I cannot, however, give it a 5 star because it IS NOT A HARD FLOOR CLEANER. If you want something that can do both, this is not the machine to buy. The brush does not turn off when you put it on the ""bare floor setting."" So it kicks more of the dirt up on your feet than it does suck it in.Hands down this is a great vacuum for carpet, but I am now in the market for something for my bare floor areas."
3,Bosch C3789 Cabin Air filter,"This filter was made in Mexico. It is made cheaper than before. The filter media is half the depth of those purchased in previous years. A paper offset has been added to conform to the dimensions required in place of the larger area media. Cheap, cheap. Not what I expected of Bosch. I will look to other producers of this filter in the future."
4,A creepy little GEM,Sweet ..disturbing and angst ridden.....perfect for the lover of GOR .....kinda like Andy Griffith and Link Wray jamming !Rare performances make the appearnace of Twang a must see .
3,GL Diet by Nigel Denby,"I saw this book in England and I liked it because it had an alphabetical list of food items, with their corresponding GL values.However, when my book arrived, it was different and did not have this list. I was very disappointed and do not understand. Had I known this, I would not have bought the book."
2,"Stroller is OK, but did not meet expectations","I received this item last night and decided to return it. I had wanted to see one in person before ordering, but Zoopers are hard to find. I had heard good things about the rest of the line, and the picture looked OK, so I decided to buy it sight unseen. In the meantime, I went to the local Buy Buy Baby to test drive last year's Ingelsina Swift, which they have on sale right now. I really liked the Swift, but still hoped I would like the Zooper Salsa when it showed it. It is an OK stroller, but it just didn't measure up after seeing the Swift. Smaller seat, strange removable seat padding, recline is done by unsnapping a few snaps near the hood and is hardly worth doing anyway and a it has a flimsy mesh basket. I think this particular model (which I assume is the 2006) is comparable to the Chicco C6/Capri and MAYBE the Volo. I was so disappointed because I think Zooper as a whole makes great strollers-this model just isn't its best."
3,Good Reference Book,"I found this book to be very heavy on scientific graphs and formulas. I think this type of information would be more appropriate for electrical engineers or engineering students than for television/video maintenance technicians. That being said, I did find some content useful as a study guide for the Society of Broadcast Engineers (SBE) exam for Certified Broadcast Television Engineer. I used this book as one of my references and did pass the test. I plan to keep it on my shelf as one of my reference texts."
4,Good guide for modelers,"This book is full of photo's and makes the written text more than understandable. This is a must have for modellers, because it's full of tricks and handsome advise how to make your project to a succes."
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this book along with several others when I bought an airbrush. It was an extra book that I found that I thought might be helpfull and I got it cheaply through the used section. I was kinda disapointed in the content. A better name for the book might be, how to use expensive aftermarket kits to make your model look better. Some of the techniques discused are advanced, but also require the use of a resin/photoetch kit. There is very little about scratchbuilding and even less about technique. Basically, it will say , ""the model has little detail in {insert area of kit}, now cutaway excess plastic and add in the {insert name of aftermarket kit}. This will improve the appearance. Now weather the model."" It never discusses how to do these things or what tools are best. I will probably use it mainly for looking at the pictures and getting ideas of what to do on my own. For that it is very good, the pictures are large, clear, and numerous from many angles."
1,Total Garbage,"This is a PDF scan that is in landscape view on the iPad Kindle, so every page is cut in half. Text and illustrations are therefore cut in half as well. You have to read this with your iPad kindle sideways while you can only read half pages at a time with the bottom line of text cut in half. Such a waste of money."
1,$25 worth of features in a $270 box,"We purchased this software to map retail locations on a region. It is missing too many features to be usable. For instance, when you import a custom graphic pushpin, the software doesn't resize it as you zoom which forces you to create multiple sizes in another program. You can add text description boxes but have no control over the font or sizing -- and they don't resize either.We highlighted our specific region but the software doesn't let you print just that region (called 'territory.) We searched the help files and their word 'territory' is not even listed.You cannot save your map graphics in any standard graphics format, e.g. JPEG, PDF or ai. We tried printing to a PDF generator, but Map Point's map output is of very poor resolution even on the highest settings.After wasting a lot of time, it's apparent we should have tried Google Maps/Earth with our graphics editing software for a solution that works."
3,Mapping made easy,Good value on this program. I found it very useful and after some initial try and fail activities I got some good data maps.
1,Disappointed,"Once I began defining the territories, using the US census geographic unit, my system crashed. I was not even halfway through the process. Microsoft's suggestions were to uninstall and reinstall but this did not fix the problem. Currently I am able to use about half of the functionality. I am very unhappy with this purchase."
3,Over priced. Flimsy. Functional,you can get one of these from your local grocery or Wal-Mart for $3-$5. I guess its bulkiness costs a lot to stock and ship. Flimsy thin walls too. It does keep stuff cold for a day.
2,not for me...,"I'm a huge brit pop fan, but I want a man to sound like a man when he sings. I just couldn't get past the vocals. To me, this was a dud of a purchase."
5,Don't 'Delay'- Check this bunk out!,"If you like your Gin Blossoms pruned with a little Mr. Big and shimmer then this is your bag. It certainly is mine. Ringing guitars, sissy vocals, and songs about traveling- A refreshing departure from whatever else is out there today."
3,Nothing to rave about...,A male vocalist who sounds like Stevie Nicks with Bangles sounding hooks and harmonies.
4,The Perfect Title,"Faded Seaside Glamour is the perfect title for this debut from England's Delays. This Southampton quartet - brothers Greg (vocals/guitars) and Aaron Gilbert (keyboards), and brothers Colin (bass), and Rowley Fox (drums) - sound like the waning days of summer in a beachside community. Songs are dreamy, languorous, joyful and relaxed, born along by Greg Gilbert's mesmerizing falsetto. ""Nearer Than Heaven"" is an immaculate summer pop song - up there with the Beach Boys - and the rest are evocations of new love, fading love, love ending, and love beginning again. There are hints of the real world encroaching here, but, hey, it's summertime, and the living is easy."
4,wacky good lighting,"We enjoy the way these little wacky lights glow, as well as the way they feel. Somehow they seem both organic and futuristic. Good times to be had with candeloos."
3,once upon a time,"I was in a parking lot, let's say Target, with Mr. Connaughty when I accidently inspired victim-mentality-lyrics of this body of work by fake bitch slapping him, in front of random strangers. He took it personally really personally....He said I am embarrassed him in front of all of these strangers as well as physically and emotionally scarring him. He even wrote about it in his journal. Seriously.Let me note it now that I did not actually hit him, and that I am female, it's not like I am a football player, which would have been, more funny.So in conclusion, make your own conclusions about buying this CD, but don't say I didn't warn you."
2,What they don't tell you....,"I use Quickbooks Pro which integrates nicely into the ""MyBusinessCheckWriter"" software program. I thought I would save money by printing my own checks, but did not realize the following: I had to purchase a special MICR toner for my printer so the scanners could read the checks; even with this there was still problems scanning and when you try to use them at a cashier expect to have problems. When I receive my bank statements, the check numbers aren't accurate because the scanners often will show a check with a five digit number to be a check with a 2 or 3 digit number. I tried to find window envelopes to match the checks, only to discover the address windows will not line up with any standard window envelopes and you can only purchase the right ones through guess where? When you add up the totals, you're money ahead ordering your checks pre-printed."
1,Be careful,"The price on this product is attractive, but it will NOT work with Quicken unless you purchase additional software (from MyChecks, of course) to allow printing to odd size checks.Basically, you print the check and payee information in one step by selecting a special ""printer"" that merges the data and sends it to your printer. This is complex and adds an unnecessary step to the process if you like to print blank checks then fill them out.If you are particularly security conscious, printing a check in one step means you don't have blank checks lying around. That's a good thing. But it's not for me, nor, I suspect for most people.Back they go."
1,Bad Fit,"These are advertised as compatible with Quicken and Quickbooks but if they are, I certainly can't make them work. The perfs are in a different location than Intuit's software can deal with. The printing will stagger off on the business 3 ups and also the business with stub."

But it's not for me, nor, I suspect for most people.Back they go."
5,Love this Watch,"I've had this watch for almost six years and love it as much as the day my husband got it for me for my birthday. The watch is perfect because it can be worn casually or dressy. I wear this watch pretty much every day and have only had very minor scratches on the steel part of the band, which were removed during a recent service (the first) I had. While I don't wear it in the ocean in case it comes off of my wrist, I wear it in the pool and hottub and have never had any problems. I highly recommend this."
1,sucks! don't buy it,"This product is ok....it charged my phone for a while. the problem was that the tip of the charger, the usb part, actually came apart. it split in two. it was not held together very well beside with two very week clips on each side of the port. Also, from putting it in and taking it out of my cigarrete lighter, the fuse actually came out and totally broke. Almost started a fire in my car because the tip was bouncing around in the cigarrete lighter and was creating big sparks!!! don't buy it!!!"
3,Amcor Ultra Clean Air Ionizer with HEPA Filter,"This was a great product until I started searching for a replacement filter for it. It has two parts to the filter, one you can remove and wash but the main part you can not wash."
3,Overpriced!!!,"Where did they come up for the price of this album? I think I paid $13 for my copy and it was a new import! This is Labyrinth's 1st full length album following their 1st demo entitled Piece Of Time in 1994. The groundwork is laid down, in all, this is almost like full length demo. The ideas are scattered all over the place, and the production is very cheap. Joe Terry sounds totally unrestrained vocally on here, and odd when you add the accent in. All the trademark Lab instrumentation is in place, but it would be 2 years before they became a much more cohesive unit. Overall, this is a strange album with a very thick Europ-vibe to it, and semi-electronica keyboards on here lend it a very weird effect. Check it out, if for anything, to hear how their sound/style evolved into the godliness that was to be on their next album."
1,Worst CD on the planet,"Labyrinth use to be a great Metal band until this CD came out. They lost there lead singer which made this album sound like someone strangling a cat. My eardrums popped when they tried to re-do ""save me"". DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ALBUM!!!"
4,Perhaps it's genetic?,"After seeing the video for ""Tide That Left and Never Came Back"" on MTV I HAD to find out more about this excellent band. Thank you Google! I discovered that Finn Andrews is the son of none other than Barry Andrews of XTC (""Dear God"")and Shriekback (""Nemesis""). Perhaps that explains it! The boy obviously knows how to write a song and I LOVE his voice. I'm buying this album today! (I'm giving it 4 stars already just for that one song.)"
2,"Great music, horrible voice","I suppose the lead singer's voice would grow on some people or grate upon others. I am one of those folks whose ears are sensitive to the unbearable chalkboard-scratching of Andrews' vocal chords and dropped vowels. This is possibly what makes The Veils more than just another band. The music is rich and textured with incredible harmonies and consuming sounds of a variety of elements. ""Lavinia"" is the richest of these songs, leading the listener into a pleasing earful of piano, guitar, and background voices. Unfortunately, it's the only song I can tolerate without feeling like my eardrums might be ripped from my head by Andrews' voice."
5,they save my life daily...,"well, most likely you will have already tried these before you order them in bulk, so my guess is you already know the magic that lies within those foily pink packages! i almost dont want to tell everyone how good they are for fear that there may be a shortage or something. seriously, i dont know why these little rings of sugar have captured my sweet tooth, but they are just plain tasty good and fun to chew. i used to eat a bag this size every day, but have cut back recently because of finances...but now, i have bulk from amazon! and with prime i get em in two days or less...which is less time than it would take me to get to a market to find them...they're not avail in every store like the five flavors...so do yourself right and order em here. best price and fastest shipping!!"
1,Product was past It's sell-by date,"I should have suspected the too-good-to-be-true price, as the nuts turned out to be a month past their expiration date. Amazon, however, immediatly refunded me the purchase price."
4,Detailed information,"Very useful. Allowed me to plan and take hikes without any other information or maps. Had good information on elevation gain, miles, etc. Maps of each hike were useful and accurate. Good background on what to expect, natural features, etc. Could use more ""subjective"" information on scenic views, how crowded it gets, etc."
3,Did You Notice,"Lumiere is a beautiful book with some interesting recipes ... BUT like many cookbooks published by aspiring celebrity chefs many small, yet critical details have been overlooked or omitted such as number of baking pans needed, sizes of pans, etc..Read, learn from this book ... but be forewarned graphic perfection does not always translate into culinary perfection unless you are an experienced cook who can recognize the books shortcomings."
2,WARNING: Season 5 Disappoints huge Rockford fans!,"We were eagerly awaiting the release of season 5 after really enjoying the first four, but WOW, what a disappointment...These episodes are intolerably slow in pace, and feature some of the worst acting we've seen on television - not to mention the uncharacteristic stupidity of the lead character! It's almost like Rockford suffered amnesia, and along with losing his memories, lost his skills and wisdom as well...We pre-ordered this set, and have ended up reluctantly forcing ourselves to watch individual episodes, where previously with the other seasons, we would gobble up multiple episodes at once...This season leaves a very bad taste in the mouth for two big fans.Time to go watch the earlier episodes again!"
2,Problem,"The discs in this series are faulty. Disc 2 is especially bad. There was skipping in Disc 1. I'm not sure where the seller got this ""new"" set, but it's disappointing. Love the series, but not with all the skipping."
4,Well worth your time...,"Viewing Rockford after all these years, I realize that my own nostalgia and an appreciation for the groundbreaking aspects of this show is much of its appeal. Pre-Rockford TV heroes typically swaggered and talked tough and never failed. Supporting characters were shallow ""yes men/women"" who were present to make their hero look good. Rockford, however, is surrounded by much more richly drawn and quirky characters--some true and loyal, all of them very human and many with questionable ethics and hidden agendas. Human weakness is often an important part of the plot and, occasionally, our hero fails. Clients lie, don't pay their bill and sometimes don't appreciate Jim's (clever and fruitful) efforts. In other words, Jiim's life can be just a little bit like ours--and we relate to him because of it. It's worth watching every episode."
5,What's up with the price?,"This product is great. My husband and son who are avid campers use it all the time, but we've purchased the same product for about $7.00 at other sites. Shop around, you can buy this much cheaper!"
5,"Exquisite album, but....","But one fact must be made clear.""A Woman's Heart"" (the title track) is NOT a Mary Black song!Eleanor McEvoy wrote and sang ""A Woman's Heart"". Mary Black only sang backup."
4,Sweet music,"We first heard this at a small shop in Ireland, where they sold us their only cd, the one that was playing. Different voices, haunting lyrics. If Summerfly doesn't evoke memories, your life has been good!"
5,Wonderful for the soul.,This was first given to me when it first came out in 93 or 94 and that cassette is long worn out.
3,"Shame on you, Bon Jovi!","Yet ANOTHER IMPORT!!! This time it's Dutch!Don't you care about your AMERICAN fans, or do you think we all can afford all these imports, just because the U.S. is a rich country?I'd LOVE to have the video, but it's simply NOT worth the inflated import price. This SINGLE actually costs more than the entire album (which, of course has no video)!"
5,Great Curlers,"Although, I would probably prefer them to not have the flocking, the sizes of the rollers are great for those of us looking to get curls with fine hair. There are numerous small and medium rollers, so I never even use the large ones"
4,very good,"the subhumans are a good example of UK punk. Powerfull speed and sound combined with intelligent lyrics and interesting guitar and bass layering lead to a very good band.I'm not giving it 5 stars because people give everything that is pretty good five stars, I would really rate this 4.5 stars.I have a hard time imagining my cd collection without this"
3,not my favorite,"Not my favorite Subhumans album...the songs just aren't as good. There are some great tracks on here such as ""Religious Wars"" , ""Peroxide"" , ""Cancer"" and alot more but a good handful are very tedious...worthy enough to add to your collection though"
4,NICE COMPILATION OF EARLY EP'S,"The best material this band ever recorded are their first 4 ep's.And they're all here,beautifully remastered (the sound is excellent).Clocking in at a decent 42 minutes+,this is a skull-splitting record,with the guitar so loud and bright few people will be able to enjoy this as it was meant to be listened to,that is at full blast !!! As a bonus,only one of the ska-ish songs that will soften future album releases is present here,and it ain't bad !!.Sweetly priced release if all of the above aren't enough reasons."
3,Rebound Air workout,"I was a little disappointed in this dvd. The music was off a little throughout the entire workout,(which is my pet peeve with any workout)!! There was also alot of counting, which wasn't necessary.The workout itself is pretty good, alot of high intensity. Overall...I would rate it a 2 or 3.Joanne in Maine"
3,Horrible intermediate section!,"The warmup and 7 minute advanced segments were fine, but the 15 minute intermediate section was awful. The instructor kept switching exercises and counting first by 8s, then by 4s, then sometimes by 8s again, but maybe not. I found that I was concentrating too much on keeping up with the switches. I'm not the only one that had trouble, at least a few people in the DVD were out of sync with her.I will play the warmup, skip to the advanced, and then put on my min-trampoline DVD which was included with the $35 mini trampoline that I bought at WalmarUpdate: After doing this for some time, the intermediate section isn't that bad, but the woman doing it grates on my nerves--I just turn the sound down on the whole workout, put on some tunes and do it."
1,DON'T ORDER THIS PRODUCT,"THIS PRODUCT IS NOT AS IT IS ADVERTISED AND I COULD NOT RETURN IT WITHOUT AN AUTHORIZATION FROM THE CO. I WROTE 4 E-MAILS REQUESTING THE LABEL AND THUS FAR NO RESPONSE FROM THE COMPANY. THERFORE, I AM STUCK WITH AN ITEM THAT I DON'T NEED.IN ADDITION, THE ADD STATED "" CLASSICS PULLS 4pk"" BUT IT IS ONLY ONE PIECE. THEREFORE, SHOULD YOU NEED THIS ITEM I RECOMMEND THAT YOU CHECK WITH LOWES OR HOME DEPOT. THAT WAY YOU WILL NOT ONLY SAVE OVER $12 OF SHIPPING FEES BUT ALSO YOU WILL BE ABLE TO RETURN IT IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT.DON'T BUY IT FROM THIS COMPANY (VERY UNRELIABLE)."
2,Very little helpful advice,"If you want to be told that you are a procrastinator and that you need to make a schedule to find the time to get organized than this book is for you. But if you are truly disorganized, sitting down and making a schedule is the last thing you will find the motivation to do. The author tells you,""don't procrastinate and get organized, set goals and make a schedule,"" but she doesn't offer any real techniques to help, and she attributes laziness to messiness. I recommendyou read, ""The New Messies Manual,"" by Sandra Felton. She takes the time to explain why you are disorganized, and HOW to get organized. She explains how to change your thinking to help you change your habits. Unfortunately, I expected more of that from this book. It is a waste of money and very dissapointing."
3,Fluffy,"This author has some great ideas, but the author includes too much fluf. Whenever a person writes a book, they have to include fluf, but I find myself uninterested in the fluf."
5,Music of Passion,"I am very familiar with Orthodox music and this CD seems to capture the mystical spirituality all in one.I recommend this CD to anyone who loves church music , and especially recommend this CD to anyone who loves Orthodox church music.This is one of the fine examples of Orthodox church music."
3,"Concise, but no coverage of customizable tags","Pros:* Not a very long book, so it cuts thru a lot of the excess verbiage and over-explanation you find in books on similar topics.* If you are an experienced Java programmer and already are a good architect, this is a quick route into learning JSP.Cons:* Omits a major JSP topic: customizable tags. This is the equivalent of an HTML book lacking a section on frames.* Unclear explanation of options on the <jsp:usebean> tag* Examples rely too heavily on large scriptlets and major database code in the JSPs, against the advice of most Java architects.Verdict:* It's a short book, which is a relief from the 1000-page tomes. Yes, this really is all there is to JSP - almost. Look elsewhere for custom tags and architectural advice."
3,Only for reference,Don't expect great things from this book. Just use it for reference. If you are doing JSP project then Web Development with JSP by Duane & Mark Kolb is excellent one.
2,Save your money,"This book tries to cover too much, too thinly. The examples covered are well-commented but cover relatively trivial examples. What is needed for those learning these topics are details as to how these would be implemented in the real world.This book is really a quick reference to the JSP specification, which you can get free from Sun.If you are looking to really learn JSP, Servlets, or Beans buy another book. You'll be disappointed in this one."
4,Book for lifetime reference,I find this book excellent and it gives an in depth knowledgeof JSP/Servlets/EJB. I have been working in ASP for a couple of yearsand have recently started developing in JSP and this book helped me a lot. I would recommend this book to everyone I know who needs to do web development in JSP.
3,a very basic JSP book,"I expected to see some detailed view on the topics mentioned in the book, but instead found the book to be too basic, in fact the entire book could have been wrapped in 30-40 pages.maybe a good starter thats all, but not for serious J2EE developers."
1,all code no explanation,"I only skimmed the book but the impression I was left with was, that the book is all code and no overview explanation. No indepth details just a bit of how to handle forms, how to send a mail with javamail, how to get startet on JDBC - stuff you easily can extract from the Java API.All the interesting stuff as how to structure taglibs, servlets etc. was by far left out (I can't recollect ever seeing anything about taglibs at all in the ""book"")"
3,excellant book on JSP,It is very good book and i appreciate the work of the authour in giving such a useful book
5,Pedantry and the MLA,"The recent hype about Mark Twain's so-called autobiography can only recall Edmund Wilson's great critique of the pedantry displayed by the MLA's insufferable guidelines for ""critical"" editions of American literary landmarks.Very little new text by Mark Twain appears in this overblown edition, given that four previous editions of his autobiographical dictations have been available for many years. What's more, Mark Twain's project was ill-conceived. It calls out for frequent deletions of trivial and irrelevant matter, and not for humorless textual notes and dry commentary. Just think of what Wilson would have had to say today about the Mark Twain Project!"
4,Good but beat hard to hear.,I really enjoy most of Leslie's workouts. The one thing I will say about this one though is the music is a little too low so it is hard to keep with the beat.
4,It's Still Leslie,"This workout has some new moves which always help keep me motivated. The transition between miles is a bit distracting, but not so much that I won't use it. I have about 15 Leslie Sansone videos and alternate between them all with my favorites changing from time to time. Her style is something I can be consistent with for life - like a diet that becomes a lifestyle choice. That long term ability to stick with a program is far better to me than mega results in a short time."
4,Great Workout!,"I have been doing Leslie for quite a few years. I must have 30 of her DVD's. Some of the short 1 mile ones all the way up to her 5 mile ones. I like them all. I feel this one can give you as good a workout as some of her longer ones. The workout for the arms with the bands is excellent. As we all know as woman we need it. The reason for the 4 stars is even though she stresses you're not learning dance moves, some of these are. And she goes pretty fast from one to the other. Now I am a Leslies Sansone person but someone who is starting out would have a problem with this. I am finding I do this one most often though as it is a terrific workout. When you're finished you feel like you have done something. Thank you Leslie!"
3,Not Her Best,This was a quick decent workout but not well executed. Moves were at times not synced well and the music was very poor. Just a tempo that was barely audible.
1,3 Mega Miles -- a big disappointment!,"I own almost every walking DVD that Leslie Sansone has sold and she missed it on this one!! You can't hear the music, therefore you can't even hear the beat to walk to! She changes moves so quickly that you miss the next moves and her own steps were off quite a few times. This DVD was a big disappointment for me because I am a HUGE fan of Leslie's and this is the only DVD that was a waste of money for me!"
2,So disappointed with 3 Mega Miles,"First, I have been disappointed in most of Leslie's newer workouts. I feel like she is forgetting her core fan base and pushing them aside while trying to cater to the younger, already fit crowd. I liked seeing a variety of ages, body types, and fitness levels, not a group of young, fit, overenthusiastic girls with a token man or overweight person. The new workouts are just too ""bouncy"" for me (and I love the boosted jogging in earlier DVDs) but can't do the bouncing without severe pain. More importantly, the music is sooo low that you can't hear it but Leslie is soooo loud that you can't turn it up.I don't recommend this one."
1,Dissapointed,"I was excited to see a new WATP, but this one misses big time. The moves are too quick. The cast is so-so. Do not buy this if you enjoy Leslie's WATP DVD's because it is not like the others. Would be OK for a serious exercise routine, not for walking. Have an love many of her other DVD's."
5,Fun Workout!,"I have at least a dozen of Leslie's DVDs and use them several times a week. I bought this one because it has the ""stretchy band"" (although she just calls it the band this time around). I did note that the band is thicker, as reviewer K. Richardson stated, and so far I've been using one of my other bands -- will work up to the thicker band.There are new moves I've never seen before both with and without the band. You get a good workout with a lot of variety and an upbeat group. As always, she provides alternatives for more advanced/higher-impact moves.This may become my favorite stretchy band video."
3,Weird video,"Why are ppl on this thing doing wrong things? Jesus is watching and he is the gateway into Heaven or Hell. This blonde girl is trying to tell me that I should go to an outdoor festival and take drugs and have sex with no consequences. What is this, 1967?"
4,Jealous Again,"Jealous Again, the EP that took over a year and three singers to complete. It was worth the wait for that time. Chavo's vocals sound best here, and the sound is better than most future recordings. It may have been better if there were more (re-recorded) tracks, though (ie: Police Story, Clocked In, Gimmie, Depression). By the way, who agrees with me that 'You Bet' is better than 'I Don't Care'?"
4,good anyway you look at him!,"i had the pleasure of seeing michael perform about a week ago as an opener for peter murphy's 2002 dust performance. the man has the guts to go out on stage armed only with his awesome voice and a danelectro. very, very talented, very sarchastic, and darker than most goth i've heard. i didn't know whether to cry tears of pain or joy when listening to this after the concert. i also got to meet him after the show; he's a pretty nice guy, very serious about his music, and i think he should have many more fans than he has. pick this up and do not be disappointed! the power is with mr. sheehy!"
