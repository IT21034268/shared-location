1,From the wife of the discredited televangelist,"You gotta love this woman's moxy. When the high-life of being Robert ""prayer requests in the Dumpster"" Tilton's wife evaporated, she picked herself right back up and developed a riff of her own, selling worthless cosmetics. Always plenty of suckers to be found."
4,"Nice, but beware the tables","This book is a great introduction to scales and temperaments for the synthesist. But beware the tables of intervals in cents - there are quite a few entries which are very inaccurate. This applies particularly to the tables for Werckmeister III and the Vallotti-Young temperament. My recommendation to the author is to bring out a second corrected edition, also updating the information on microtonal capabilities of synthesizers."
5,Best introduction to microtonal music and consonance theory.,"A wealth of microtonal music theory is presented in a friendly and easy to understand format. There are sections on acoustics, psycoacoustics, scale theory, scale history, and a list of synthesyzers and their microtonal capabilities. Over 20 different scales are spelled out in cents, ratios, and key mappings for synthesyzers. You don't have to be an electronic musician to benefit from this book. It's also a perfect introduction to Helmholtz's ""On the Sensations of Tone"". 120 pages."
5,Pleasantly surprised,"I recently got a guide dog, and will need to put my cat food up on a smooth table and wanted to contain the small bits of food that fall away from the dishes. I didn't even think about the dishes sliding off the table until I read the description on this product and it mentioned the non-skid feature.I ordered four and since I am blind, I didn't really know what to expect from the description. I received them today, and they are about the size of a smallish serving tray. They are a hard plastic material with raised bumps on the top and the edges have the non-skid rubber material that is slightly raised. They will work great for containing food and water. One tray will easily hold two small cat dishes. One tray will hold one large dog dish. I think they are going to be absolutely perfect!"
1,It's so bad I'm returning it,"They say the colors may vary, yes, but they don't tell you it may be a dirty off-white, with the same color ""non-slip"" corners -- nothing like the sharp looking one in the picture. It looked used. It arrived dirty and had scratches and gummy residue where someone had scraped off a label on the top. Even if it looked decent, the so-called ""non-slip"" feature is worthless. I set it on all different floor surfaces and it slipped easily on each one. Doubt it would stay in place long with my Great Dane mix. I'm returning it tomorrow."
3,Not bad for the price,"The food mat tends to remain stationary with the four corners having a ribbed bottom (black) and slightly raised from the blue base of the mat. While the four corners help the tray to 'stick', however, the fact they aren't level with the blue base makes the mat uneven, as the weight of the food dishes presses on it. After a few weeks the blue is no longer level (flat), so the dishes aren't flat and slip a little. Also, my dog tends to slop the water, and very little goes out of the blue mat with it's 1/4 inch high rim. All in all, not a bad pet food mat."
5,"Holds the bowls, stays in place!","This placemat works really well for my dog- he weighs around 17 lbs. I use heavy(ish) ceramic bowls that have flat bottoms, and the rubber corners keep not only the place mat on the floor, but they keep the bowls on the mat. I don't know how well this would work with lighter bowls, or bowls with a more rounded bottom. I also keep the mat on ceramic tile which has a little more texture than a linoleum floor. I can't be sure that it would work for everyone, but it's awesome for us! Also- there is no way to choose your color- we were expecting blue like the photo, but we ended up with white. White is great for my kitchen, but I probably would have been upset if I ended up with pink."
4,Good for messy cat,"Great to catch the mess from a cat who does not know how to keep his food in his dish. Though, cleaning is difficult, as the food gets around the raised design of the bottom. Does not fit well in most dishwashers, but just soak it and it comes clean."
3,Susan,"The tray was bowed in the middle, but I decided not to return the tray. Just need to be careful of water or food over flow."
5,Does the job,"Like another reviewer, I too received a white mat bordered in black. That is great because the water bowl it lies under is the large black ceramic one (Pioneer Big Max) sold here on amazon. Black and white go together well, the mat on the carpet doesn't budge, the bowl on the mat is also securely held in place and the thing catches water splashes when the doggies drink. That's about all I was looking for."
2,I wanted to like it!,"I think the game play is great the music was good but the main thing that made me give this a low rating are none other than the lacking of the graphics they are absolutely horrible and it makes it really hard to see where you going sometimes.Well thats all I got to say, This game would have been great if it weren't for the attrocious graphics and I think the PC version was alot better."
4,"Superb, but not the best port.","The censoring is no big deal, however, there are some negatives to this port.The game is a bit slow, not that much though. The game is rather dark too, so enemies can be hard to spot. The game's window is smaller then usual too.However, this game is still awesome, and classic.By the way, this game comes with a RED cartridge."
4,I OWN DOOM!!!,"Doom---just the name alone makes you drool over your BFG 9000 and Shotgun. Direct from the PC to your SNES system Doom is a fun FPS on the SNES. With the used of the FX2 chip the graphics are not bad for it's time and the music is quite good. However there are some cons to the game...1: You can't save your game, once you start you have to play all the way through but you can gain access to the other chapters but selecting harder difficulty setting.2: Controls are VERY rough on your D-pad hand. You move a bit sluggish and the controls fell a bit heavy.3: Graphics are good for a SNES system but long play and your eyes are going to fell like you've been staring at the sun all day.Although it has it's short comings it's still the Doom we all know and love."
4,not as good as the Jaguar version but still good,"I think the Jaguar version is better...I guess it's the graphics that makes me like the Jag version better. The one area the SNES version does better than the Jag version is music...well actually the Jag version has NO in-game music whatsoever, but it makes it creepier. But for a 16-bit game, SNES Doom is great."
1,This sucks.,"Next to Sega CD the worst version of DOOM. The graphics suck and you can barely tell what anything is, the sound is decent (the one star), the controls are horrid, the gameplay is horrid and the shores of hell freezes up on start, so all you really have is a butchered port of Knee Deep & Inferno with horrid controls. Terrible."
1,It is just an okay version of doom.,"First of all, Here are the PROS and CONSPROS:Good for the people who own a SNES, not PC.CONS:really bad graphics.slower animation than PC.you can't save the game.It is shorter than the PC version of doom.Overall: 0.9This is a pretty good game, but not for SNES!Get it on PC. That version is alot better."
2,It looks like Atari,"This game has such bad graphics that it's not even fun. This is Super NES not Atari ( if you played the game you'd know ) I've read reviews that say "" oh this game has good graphics "" for Atari. I'm a big shooter fan and if this is it ( with I don't think it is ) for Super NES I'm going to be playing a lot of Mario World lately. I'm researching for other Super NES shooters that are out there."
1,Stay away,"I have had nothing but problems with this monitor. So far, the company (NEC) has sent me 2 DOA (dead on arrival) replacement monitors that are supposedly rebuilt. They are both worse than my original.I think this model just wears out faster than the average CRT monitor. Mine died after 1 year."
4,A hit,"My 2.5 year old daughter adores this book. We bought this one as a replacement (she is very hard on books). I was a little sad that I didn't get it as hard cover, but I sit with her and we read it together, we sing it, she loves it. It is definitely her favorite book."
4,A Good Teaching Tool for Days of the Week,"This is a nice illustrated book following the children's song ""Today is Monday."" It is illustrated in Carle's inimitable collage-art style with a different animal introducing each day and food, and ending with a lot of children sitting around a table eating the different foods. The song is repetitive and uninteresting, but the pictures are very nice. Singing books are wonderful teaching tools, and this is the best book I have found so far for teaching the days of the week.Unfortunately there is no musical score included, but you can find it on YouTube."
2,Not Eric Carle's best work,"I love Eric Carle's books, but this one does not measure up to his other works. It introduces an animal eating a food on each day of the week starting with Monday (not Sunday), but there is no plot and is just plain boring. Wish I hadn't spent my money on this one."
2,Not His Best,"I purchase library books for a 200 plus student preschool. The children may choose their own book each week. Off the top of my head I know of 8-10 parents that would object to the picture of the fox with a chicken in its mouth. While I personally did not have a problem with the picture, I have to review it through the eyes of others. I sent the book back."
5,Great Book For Toddlers and English Language Learners,"Kids love the pictures for Eric Carle books, and this one is no exception. I bought this book for my daughter, who is teaching English to children in Germany. The words are simple enough for new English language learners, and the board book format will hold up well with many hands using it!"
3,What if you don't know the song?,"Perhaps this book would be better for me and my son if I knew the song that supposedly goes with the book title. Wouldn't it be great to have a button in the front that played the tune of the song so everyone would get the fun of this book? My 3 year old likes the book, but I think he would love it if I knew the song."
3,An okay American Girls Short Story.,"This is another of the American Girls Short Stories. This one is about Kit and is set in Cincinnati, Ohio, in the year 1933. For ten-year-old Kit Kittredge and her friends, playing baseball during the summer break from school is a way to escape from the problems caused by the Great Depression. But Mrs. Howard, a boarder at the Kittredge home and the mother of Kit's friend, Stirling, doesn't approve of baseball and never seems to do anything useful. However, when Kit gets hurt playing baseball, she learns that Mrs. Howard is a good person with something to contribute.This was an okay book but not the best of the American Girls Short Stories. The other Kit story, Kit's Tree House, was a lot better. I'd recommend this to readers who want to read all of Kit's stories, but they may be a bit disappointed."
2,You've got to wonder how movies this bad get made,"I cannot figure out what was worse the acting or the script. I realize there may be a shortage of good scripts, so I can be somewhat forgiving about that. But there is no shortage of good actors, so I have no idea who was paid off to cast this bunch. I've seen better acting in porno movies - honestly. Actually at the start of the film I thought it may have been one of those soft porn films since the movie had no rating and the acting was so bad. On the plus side, the movie was only an hour and thirty minutes, so my suffering was over quickly and the teenage girl was sort of nice to look at. I gave it two stars because I made it through the entire movie without bashing my head against a concrete wall to distract me from the pain this movie inflicted on my brain and like I said the teenage girl was easy on the eyes."
3,about this DVDfilm Angel Blue........,"This film is actually against the law (illegal film) to have as this story is basically about underaged sex between a married woman and a young teenager girl which end up in police case or even kill case, not going to talk much or else will not be nice to watch. Recommended to those whom are interested in this genre of film.Angel BlueReview written by:Dr, MR Franc MBBS (PhD) GPS Ang Poon KahDirector Lou Ye (Ang Poon Kah) for film the summer palaceDirector """" (Ang Poon Kah) for film the kite runner."
4,Great watch,"Very nice watch. Many useful, easy-to-use functions. I have had this watch for almost five years and have never had to change the battery. I have also gone scuba diving with it several times. The auto-light feature is useless but amazes all my friends... (you can chose to have the backlight come on automatically with you flick your wrist) The alarm is quite loud."
4,I Read This Book Because I Knew Nothing About The French Revolution,"This was a good introduction to the French Revolution. The only bad thing i have to say about the book is that sometimes the author seems to think everyone knows the French language (with quotes in french that are rarely translated,) but that happens infrequently enough that the reader doesn't miss out on anything. I certainly would recommend it to anyone with a curiosity about the chain of events that lead the citizens of France into total madness."
4,The October Days,"I am most pleased to read that the updated edition of this book has the correct month listed for the Days of the Market Women as OCTOBER 1789, as opposed to August that was cited throughout the first edition in 1980. I was amazed that this mistake was made by such a noted historian. Otherwise, it is a fine depiction that the everyday reader will find enjoyable and informative."
2,OVERVIEW???,"If this is a good overview of the French Revolution, then I hope Idon't run across a bad one. By focusing on the big ""days"", I had nocontext, and ended up without a clear sense of what happened when.Also, there was a very snide tone that I found off-putting. Theauthor gives the impression that the French Revolution was a hugemistake made by bloodthirsty morons. If nothing else, reading thisbook made me hungry to read more, by authors who may take a lessprejudiced view."
3,The Days of the French Revolution,"In Short, The book covers the essential and desired elements of the Frech Revolution. However there are some issues that need attention. There seems to be a problem with the continuity in each section. The action elements jump between the various revolutionary groups without a transition which makes the text hard to follow. The the writing style also makes the reading a bit tedious. Many of the location names and common event names are in French, which is ok, but a complete translation of these terms and a map would be very helpful."
3,Average,"What little knowledge I had of the French Revolution before reading this book came from the book ""Lafayette"" by Harlow G. Unger; and while I did learn more about the revolution from this book, it doesn't flow as smoothly as Unger's book. For me the book was difficult to follow at times, but that may very well be my lack of overall knowledge of the French Revolution and the cast of characters. I would have to say that the book is a good overall summary of events and should give the novice like myself a better understanding of the French Revoultion."
4,A Turbulent Period of History,"""The Days Of The French Revolution"" tells the story of this turbulent period of French History. Reading like a novel, Hibbert imparts information while holding our interest. Here we meet the leading figures of the Revolution, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, Robespierre, Napoleon and many others. While reading, we agonize over the fateful decision of the Royal Family to flee Paris and to seek rescue from foreign powers and cringe at the tragic descent into the Terror. We read narratives, speeches, letters and diaries of those who made and lived through the Revolution. From the reading of this book I have a much better understanding of the course of the Revolution and an appreciation for the forces which impelled it as well as the tragic and seemingly irrational paths which it followed. If there is any shortfall it is the concentration on events in Paris to the virtual exclusion of events in the rest of the country. I am glad that I read this book."
5,Excellent and well researched!,"A great book for the 5-8 grades. I read this book when I was 13 and today I write historical fiction. It is an excellent example of young adult historical fiction, This book is both well written and well researched. It tells the story of two young jewish woman, taken away from thier parents by the Portugese inquisition and sent to Brazil and thier survival during these difficult times. A worth while read!"
1,very disappointing,"I cannot believe I wasted my time on this book. This is the first time I have ever written a review of a book, but I don't want others to think that they are getting something that they are not. It was a lot of women that work b/c they want to (which I respect), but gave no helpful information. How does she really do it? The moral of this book is you do it by making a lot of money.I do not think by any means that money buys happiness, but you cannot argue that money makes life easier.I want to know how working moms without a sizeable income REALLY do it...and this book did not go there."
1,Limited Perspective and Poor Writing Skills,"This writer frustrated me. She focused only on wealthy corporate high-achievers; she believes evolution has given mothers a superior ability over fathers to remember whose birthday party is on which weekend and also to remember to pick up milk; she describes all her subjects according to hair and eye color and what they ate during the interview; and she really needs an editor to give her writing shape and focus. She made the same point in every single chapter; why bother w/chapters at all, if she's going to present the same themes on every page? And, perhaps my most visceral complaint, she equates feminism with not shaving legs and underarms and with burning bras. Skip this book."
2,Completely Devoid of Practical Tips and Advice,"I expected so much from this book, and I'm sure that's why I found it terribly disappointing. For starters, it was obviously rushed to print, and the editing is so poor as to be distracting. Add to that Sachs' failure to interview ""mainstream mommies"" and her focus on the emotional aspects of juggling motherhood and career, and I found myself wondering at the end why I'd invested time--precious for any working mother--in reading something completely devoid of practical tips and advice. I suppose it's a small comfort to know that celebrity moms feel pangs of guilt, too, but all in all, the title, ""How She Really Does It: Secrets of Successful Stay-at-Work Moms"" is misleading."
3,Amusing but not much more,"There are a couple of touching stories and a couple of good insights, and a good portion of it is entertaining, but don't expect anything deep or especially instructive."
5,"Hey, this is for ladies!","I have not seen this movie since it was released. Really need to buy the DVD now and see it again and again. But it's so remarkable, I still vividly remember three things that I've repeated over and over in my praise of the film through the years: 1) O'Toole gave an amazing and unexpected comedic performance, 2) Laney Kazaan played basically the same motherly role, though Jewish, in Favorite Year that she played 20 years later, as the Greek maternal counterpart, in My Big Fat Greek Wedding; 3) Greatest dialogue was between the late Selma Diamond and O'Toole in the ladies rest room. When a very intoxicated O'Toole was discovered by Selma in the ladies room, urinating in a commode, she said, ""Hey, what are you doing in here? This is for ladies."" Without skipping a beat, O'Toole answered, ""And so, my dear, is this. But from time to time I must run some water through it."" Buy it, you'll love it."
5,One Of My Favorite Films !,"I would have to place this into my top ten favorite films of all times. It's a rather unknown delightful comedy that should not be missed by any movie fan. Peter O'Toole, Mark Linn-Baker and the rest of the cast are perfect in their rolls. You will not be sorry renting or buying this DVD."
5,A wonderful romp!,"A movie based on Mel Brooks time as a young writer on an early TV variety show, what could be better?? Not much, Peter O'Toole as the ""Errol Flynn"" actor. Another non-main stream movie for all of those who like things a bit off the beaten path.."
5,"""Oh God, this makes me happy!""","I can't add much more than the other 5-star reviews here. This is the only film I ever took 8 different people to see on 8 different occasions when it was released. Genuinely funny, an abundance of memorable lines and one great scene after another make this a classic. There isn't a wasted moment in this, and the performances are letter-perfect. Of course with Mel Brooks working behind the scenes here - drawn from his own experiences with Sid Caesar - it doesn't get any more accurate than this.The only gripe I have is the one I've been whining about for years: When will this finally be released on DVD!?!"
4,Huge O'Toole fan's will love this!,"I love this movie! A ""movie star"" flawed in every way, but beloved by the public that sees him as the heroes he plays on screen,gets the wake up call of his life! It only goes to show you that we are all human and this man finds his humanity and possibly his soul, amoungst the common people."
4,This book is written for the people... By the people,"Communion Letters serves as a wakeup call to those who persist in denying the experiences of thousands of individuals all across the globe. If nothing else...this book should have made people seriously question ""What Is Going On Here?"" It also is a great help to those who might think they are alone in their confusion as it is a CLEAR indication that ""We are NOT Alone"" at all....cosmicly speaking Rose"
1,Bio -- A rip off,"Frankly this product is not worth $0.50. Since the description doesn't identify it with the length, you have no idea, until you pay for it, that it is one typewritten page of readily available information. Don't waste your money or time!"
2,Did not want the story to end,"This book the ending of a trilogy was the first one I read passed on to me by a friend. I fell in love witht the characters and immediately rushed to find the rest in the series. The book centers around the character Grace Agbrigg a young heiress who as a young woman is terrified of being married for her money. We follow her triumphs and her failures and ultimately her struggle for independence, something not only unheard of in her society but completely forbidden. Grace is challenged by her desires both for love and for freedom and a way to have both. A wonderful story relating a greater fight for recognition of women in a society created by men."
1,This Game Sucks,"I haven't played anygood sport games yet and i thought this one would be diffrent, but it is'nt it's boring and ridicolus i'd rather play the sport than a game."
2,Not what I was looking for :(,"This video is ok if you're looking for a relatively gentle head-to-toe yoga type stretch with some ballet influence. I was looking more for a targeted lower extremity stretch to help me improve my ballet extensions and turnout. I'm not an expert on videography, but the quality in that regard is a bit harsh -- like it wasn't filmed through a soft lens. The ""hoarsness"" in her voice that another reviewer complained about sounds like it may just be her natural voice -- didn't bother me at all."
4,Recommended,"This was a good video to help loosen and stretch the body. I did not find it very vigorous -- not like a traditional boot camp -- but it was what I was looking for. I consider this a good warm up or cool down for more vigorous exercise, and I use it before or after I do a heavy body sculpt workout or after a dance class."
2,overpriced video,"I bought this at the same time that I bought the Element Ballet Conditioning video. Ballet Bootcamp Stretch was $20 more expensive than the Ballet Conditioning video, and it wasn't half as good. I did not enjoy the workout as much as the Ballet Conditioning one."
2,Adapter missing,I sent this directly to my father as a gift because he was traveling to Germany. He only received 3 of the 4 stated adapters. The company has been really responsive to my negative feedback but overall it wasn't the best experience given that I sent this as a gift.
3,Don't believe everything you read :),"Just scanning the synopsis of this book is quite distressful. I am hoping that the book does not say something as completely wrong as ""his sudden deafness at age 26."" That is completely false. I am not sure about this book, but I would highly recommend Maynard Solomon's ""Beethoven"" It is a careful and thoughtful analysis of the man and the musician."
5,A band to fall in love with!,"Shamra is an awsome band. I've known them personally for two years now and let me tell you, they have sure have grown as artist. Usally you don't see such improvement in artists in such a small amount of time, but they guys have done it! If you think just because they sound good on the cd doesn't mean they wont sound good in person. They are even better in person. They have a fresh hip sound to them and I can see them making it far in the music business. They have a good clean words and once you hear them once your stuck for life!"
1,Big Mistake.,"I got this album from a friend, she said it was good. However, it was very bad! This album made me want to vomit."
2,Incompatability,"This Sigma lens is incompatible with the Nikon D3100. It is not an AF lens, and the attachment does not even lock in place. Essentially I've blown the cost of the device -- which was not inconsequential. Since I have a number of other SLR's, (Canon, Sony), I hoped that the lens might be usable as backup for those cameras, but, alas, no soap."
1,bad lens for d3000,"this lens does not work on nikon d300 or any camera like it, check out manufactures(sigmas) web site to get a better view of cameras it will work on. Hard to use, apature ring bad position, only manual focus!!!!( no a/m switch like picture shows just bad lens. all I can say,"
3,Great lens but hands get shaking,I'll simply say two things:It is a good lens enjoyable to use. And U dont need to change lens during your shooting. (although it does not have a wide angle if you dont have a full frame. 28*1.5=42 42 is a normal angled objective(1.5 is the focal multipler of the nikon non-fullframe cameras)) especially gives great macro photos.The bad thing is when you are using more den 150-200mm focal lenth you must use high shutter speed so you can have a clear photo otherwise you can have a blur one.This objective good in static shooting but I dont recomand shooting far scenes with out a tripod.thanks or reading :)
3,Ok cheap lens,"I bought it to be my primary lens for my first DSLR, but it has been a disappointment. While the idea is great, it has a few design flaws. Lock of the zoom extension started malfunctioning fairly soon, rubber coating for some reason started coming off as well. While coating does not really affect anything, malfunctioning zoom lock has adverse effect. It is not exactly the sharpest of the lenses either.You get what you pay for. You will not get a great zoom lens to go to 300mm at the price, so it's worth what it sells for. If you are serious about it, you should investigate a bit before committing to this product."
3,Just a warning...,"If numerous typos in a book make you feel as though you're not getting your money's worth, then the Kindle edition of ""The Red King"" is going to make you regret having paid more than fifty cents for this. Though I'm fairly new to reading tablet books, this is the first instance where I've noticed SO MANY typos/spacing issues. Very surprising (not to mention disappointing). If they need to hire a proofreader, I'm available!As for the novel itself, the plot is hardly original -- I seem to remember a DS9 episode that covered similar territory -- but the authors nicely capture the ""voice"" of familiar characters. It's nice to have them back in my head."
3,Meh.,This was my second foray into Trek lit in over ten years (The first being Titan: Taking Wing). It was good but wasn't stellar. I would put it as slightly below the first book in the series. It's worth a read b/c it's good to see some Star Trek that's not lousy. But don't read it if you're not going to read the whole relaunch thing or if you haven't read the previous book.
4,Better than the First; Still not Outstanding,"Overall, I found The Red King more enjoyable than Taking Wing. The characters are more engaging in this book, and there was more of a sense of adventure, danger, and unknown. It had a much truer ""Star Trek feel""--the characters needed to overcome obstacles internally and externally to solve the problems they faced, and they did so in intelligent and creative ways. The book also explains Tuvok & Akaar's backgrounds. Although far from a literary or even a sci-fi masterpiece, The Red King was a pleasing sequel to Taking Wing, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has read the first installment of the Star Trek: Titan series."
3,hmmm...,"I was pretty eager to know how the adventures of the Titan crew continue after ""Taking Wing""...and was a little disappointed by this book.The story developement is very slow, which is not a bad quality per se, if the time is used to give the reader more insights in the participating characters, but in this case...To me it was nothing more than a average TNG emergency evacuation episode without a real climax...pity."
3,"Decent Star Trek Fiction, But......","""Titan, Book Two: The Red King (Star Trek, the Next Generation)"" has a most intriguing premise; the crew of the USS Titan, under the command of Captain William T. Riker, rescue altered humans, the Neyel, and other sapient species from one of the Magellanic Clouds, thanks to some timely, if reluctant, intervention by Romulan Commander Donatra and a fleet of Romulan warbirds. But is this great ""Star Trek"" literature of the kind I've come to expect from Diane Duane at her best? The short answer is unfortunately no, though this ""Star Trek"" novel has more fleshed-out characters than one I had read recently about the crew of Jonathan Archer's Enterprise, which was also written by these two authors. However, I suspect that diehard fans of ""Star Trek"" will find this a credible sequel to the film ""Star Trek: Nemesis""; for this reason alone it deserves a marginal recommendation from me."
3,Wierdly PC and Too Many Characters,"The characters and plot are wierdly PC.Diversity and inclusionism were pushed just a little too hard. I hate it when an author tries to make a political statement disingenuously. There are way too many characters and they are very underdeveolped. I had to backtrack more than a few times so i could figure out which character was which.Also, the plot was poorly and too quickly resolved. That said, it was entertaining. Basic Star Trek story, and an enjoyable read."
2,"titan, book two the red king star trek the next generation","not as good as the first one, but a good overall star trek story . hopping the powers that be will use these books as a story line for a movie."
3,Product Description Not Accurate,"This is not a cordless keyboard, and there is no mouse, mini-receiver, dust cover or CD. It's just a standard keyboard with a medium length cord to connect to the PS3."
4,If you liked the Nixons,"Well, if you liked the Nixons I think you will enjoy this album from Zac. I personally loved it. I've seen him perform his solo stuff at the Curtain Club and it rocked..."
4,poor packaging,"The others have done a very good job explaining the plot of this anime, so I'm not gonna. The animation quality is amazing and the voice acting (both the original Japanes and the English dub) is superb. As a matter of fact my only problem with Dance in the Vampire Bund is the case it comes in. It comes in a dvd size case, which stinks because it doesn't fit with the rest of my Blu-Rays. The art work on the packaging is great, I just wish I could display it on my Blu-Ray shelving. Oh well, that's my only gripe. Great anime, great value, poor packaging."
4,"Excellent series, decent blu ray.","This series is absolutely incredible. Though the anime does seem a bit rushed, it knows how to grab your attention and draw you into a watching spree. Many are saying the dub is terrible, but in my own opinion it is really well done. The only reason why i give 4 stars, is the factor in the blu ray. Occasionally you see the glowing factor in certain scenes. It's subtle but still noticeable. All in all the series is a 5/5, blu ray 4/5, Thus the reason behind the 4."
4,anime lover,Enjoyed the storyline and characters. A little weird about the young boy and high schooler...lolita complex reversed...but otherwise a good anime series. I hope funimation picks up many more good animes.
4,dance in the vampire,well I have only whatched a few in sub cause i would rather watch the dub.after that I went looking for the manga and found one on MANGAREADER on the internet and gose up to chapter 47 at this. reading this and the episodes are different starts but the anime follws the manga are quite close to each other. the manga gose past where the anime ends and is possible for a second season which personally think wont happen. as for getting the anime i think it is worth it.the only i dont like is the fact your buying it twice dvd and blue ray i just want one or the other thanks
5,Nice Anime,"I have a great appreciation of ANIME art and this series has some that is quite good and much to my liking. Actually, the story and the characters were a bit better than I expected, specially when I viewed the full series for the second time. There was a good bit more adult humor than I expected which was a plus for me. This DVD is not for small children; however, those from young teenagers to adults will likely enjoy it. I have a small collection of original color cells from anime movies and would really like to add one or two from this series."
3,"Good, but could've been better...","Where to begin? Well, it's a pretty darn good collection no doubt about it, with all those great RCA/Bluebird classics and choice cuts from the radio broadcasts. But, the sound quality is heavy on the noise reduction. Some may like it, but I did not. That's what's keeping me from giving this collection 4 or 5 stars. Where as the RCA collection (5 stars) breathes better, and has all the sparkle and fire that is missing from these Avid collections. So, if you're not afraid of a little surface noise, go for the RCA collection. Finally, the Avid booklet is alright, but not great. For example, the pictures are really small and the story wasn't in depth. Where as the RCA booklet was much better on both counts."
4,Well worth buying if you liked Souls' Core... but...,"the ""but"" is, that... eggshells, the album shawn recorded just before Soul's Core, is even better! So it makes more sense to, buy that instead and then think about Big Blue Sky and Better Days.First Ten Years is still pretty good though!"
4,great compilation of previous works,"the first ten years is a career spanning album covering his first song written on an acoustic guitar (drumming clown) to his covers on recent movie soundtracks. a new version of ""lately"" is included. the new ""lately"" lacks any acoustic guitar accompianment and is a rocked up version of the original. fans of shawn's acoustic sound will be left wanting more. the first ten years includes many favorites from his past albums including ""canyons and caverns"" and ""joshua"". Shawn wrote a story in the liner notes, detailing his rise to fame, and there's some old pictures of his name up on at the roxy, an atlanta venue. First ten years is a must for new fans who don't have shawn's previous albums, and for older fans who don't have his newest stuff."
2,Not the book I thought it would be!,"The description said ""biography"" and didn't list the number of pages. I was under the impression it would be a fairly good-sized biography of G'nR. Instead it was a very short magazine with most of it's very few pages devoted to song lyrics and music. Perhaps I should have seen it was publised by Cherry Lane Music and been suspicious. This is not a biography in the slight stretch of the term. It's sheet music for those who play with a few photos and a reprint of a magazine interview thrown in. This was a HUGE dissapointment for someone trying to read a real biography of G'nR."
3,"Too brief, too shallow","It's somewhat odd for there to be a court tv documentary of Lenny Bruce, when the man truly had no idea what he was doing in the courtroom. (He knew what he wanted, and he valued the court system and the law, but his conduct in the courtroom was not geared towards success.)The video has a bit of interesting information, and some good clips, but nothing that the Bruce devotee hasn't seen or heard before.The presentation is adequate, but you can tell that the narrator is reading a script that he only somewhat understands. There's an air of disinterest that pervades the whole thing.Of course, if you are a devotee, then you will need this. Otherwise, there are many other more interestings cds and videos to look at."
2,A Non-Inspiring Piece of Work,"Michele Salzman does her field no great favor in a piece of literaute that amounts to nothing more than a picture book. Peter Brown must be rolling in his grave at this. Since when do Renaissance calendars have anything to do with late antiquity? The writing style is elegant, but the subject off key. I suggest readers look for more informative history books rather than this particular one."
4,Uniquely fantastic,"A unique story that keeps the pages turning. The life of Annie, and Andrew, and what comes next. The descriptiveness of Scotland allows the reader to be there with Annie.Patiently awaiting the sequel."
1,One of the Most Poorly Written Books I've Ever Read,"This book is full of cliches and unnecessary minutiae. The writing is that of a young teenage girl. When characters are sad, we don't need to know that the corners of their mouths turn down. The male characters are entirely unbelievable with all their sensitivity sharing as college students. Young males don't talk like that. When our main character arrives in Scotland, we are forced to read about every moment in her first few days, including pages on what she ordered to eat and a full conversation between her and the waitress as to how she took her coffee. Too much detail! Who cares! The last 100 pages are excruciatingly drawn out. The only reason I finished it was because it was under discussion at my book group."
5,Mesmerizing,I loved this book never wanting to put it down. Barbara's writing pulls you right in to where you are indeed a part of the story.
2,Terrible book - spoiler alert,"I really can't believe how glowing all of the reviews of this book are. I found this book to be predictable and trite, with plot lines that are ridiculously overused (lovers separated by wealth/family and letters that are never received - but are discovered years later???).I also did not like the characters much at all. Annie is not a great heroine; she is a serial cheater and home-wrecker. Also, she leaves her son indefinitely to ""find herself"" - I don't think this is OK in any circumstance. Her only ""bright"" spot was her relationship with Tom Keegan.The only thing that I agree with in the other reviews is that I've become more curious about St. Andrews."
5,Absolutely Incredible!,This book is amazing!!!!! I have seldom read anything that so totally absorbed me. From the first page Barbara Berot drew me into the lives of these characters and I found myself living their story. I can honestly say I have never cried when I have read any work of fiction but I did when Andrew and Annie had to part. I cannot wait to start the second book to see where Barbara Berot takes these characters and me!
2,Two Thumbs Down,"Our Book Group read this book based on the positive reviews posted on Amazon.com. What a disappointment it turned out to be for us. We found the protagonist, Annie, to be a weak, self-indulgent and immature character. None of us felt sympathy or empathy towards Annie or her unrequited lover, Andrew. The best thing the book had going for it was the description of St. Andrews. We unanimously gave it Two Thumbs Down."
5,One of my all time favorites!,This is one of my all time favorite stories and that is all it is for all the negative reviewers! I loved that it left you hanging and was so glad to have the sequel in hand to continue the story. Highly recommended. Great summer read!!
5,Exhilarating!,"This book has such depth of character development, along with excellent descriptions of the settings. Both pull the reader into the story as if s/he was living it in reality. Barbara's second book takes up where this one leaves off and is just as good. Her third will be launched in October 2010, and I'm eagerly awaiting the finale to this trilogy!"
3,Over-rated,"While I enjoyed this book, I found the writing style to be simplistic and the plot in parts were incredibly predictable.Seemed like a slightly more exotic Danielle Steel novel."
5,An Awesome Journey of Youth and True Love,"""When Europa Rode the Bull"" infuses your heart and soul with the memories of your youth, difficult choices and true Love, you will be captive to wanting more. This novel feeds the need for true Passion in all of us and surprises you with welcome memories of being young and so idealistic. What an Awesome debut novel and a must read!!!! Thank You Barbara for your tender thoughts and your great gift to us. I can't wait for more......"
5,This book pulls you in.,"When Europa Rode the Bull was the book my Book Club voted to read - what a great choice! I was immediately pulled into the book, and had a hard time putting it down. Do not be put of by the number of pages - it is a gripping, fast read. Highly recommended!"
1,No Need For This Book,I agree with one of the reviewers who said this book was a complete waste of money. I aslso like Scott Cunningham and I also own his Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs. If you have the Encyclopedia then you don't need this book and if you don't have it then buy the Encyclopedia rather than this book. In my opinion this book should have gone out of print when the Encyclopedia came out.
3,Faulty but a good book,"This book was a really good one. I just have one major problem with it, he didn't bother to warn people about whether or not something was poisonous. It is a good reference for people that already have some experiences with herbs. Never use an herb unless you know for sure it isn't toxic or poisonous."
4,Good to start with,A lot of good information for beginners. I would recommend this to someone just getting into the Magickal applications of herbs.
5,Love It,i bought this book because i wanted to know more about herbs and it was everything i wanted and needed.
5,Magic Plants,"As with all Scott Cunningham's books it is well written and full of information. Great resource book, great addition to any library for a green witch or herbalist."
1,Enough already!,"Sorry to say that this will be the last book by Cunningham that I will every buy. Every book is beginning to be the same book with a different cover.Listed below are the reasons I have a problem with this book:Cunningham preaches all the way from beginning to end on moral ethics. It's as if he's the moral police. He tells the reader that he doesn't give certain oils/herbs because they may violate the Rede. It's ridiculous and getting OLD! I know there is a movement for Witches to show themselves as GOOD,but get a grip! It seems to be a trend for authors to learn all they can then turn around arrogantly and tell the reader what you shouldn't know. I think everyone should be their own moral police. How can you truly learn magick one sided.If you want the same tired formulas, moral whipping, and arrogance go ahead get the book!"
4,Puts my daughters to sleep,"Mom of two that loves this, my daughters get grumpy and are ready to go to sleep and I just turn it on. They become calm and go to sleep."
4,Uniquely Done.,"Adult themes. Not for children. Uniquely done using the amazing Studio Artist application (one of my favorites), this is an emotionally engaging film. Although filmed, the entire film was then painted. It did not get an adequate public release, which is disappointing. I can't quite give it five stars, but I'd give it over four. Some fine acting, especially by Randall Duk Kim who played three great parts. It took me forever to find a version I could watch. I was finally able to find a rental copy through AppleTV. As far as I know, this film is unrated. Some nudity. Adult situations. No sex. Rare language. Some violence, though not close to other films. I would suggest it might be a PG-13, though a good argument could be made that it should be an R. From several perspectives, this is art. Though a low budget movie, its story holds its own against movies costing far more to make. I am hoping to be able to find and purchase a copy."
2,Uncomfortable,"I bought these for my daughter and she has complained of the thick seam that runs up and down, just at the top of the thigh area and onto the waistband. I don't know why they chose to seam these undies there. I have never seen them do that before. The seam is very raised and it rubs her and her jeans make it worse."
1,Did not work; defective.,"The concept behind this device is a good one, but it is built with shoddy components. Mine did not work out of the box (the microphone input plug fell apart (or was never together). I had to send it back."
4,Stars of the Past,"One of the roles for female stars prior to World War II in Hollywood was the Vamp and this type of role has rarely been seen on the screen since. It is about time that someone has paid tribute to these largely forgotten ladies. They were outfitted in the most extravagant costumes and some, like Barbara La Marr and Clara Bow, led lives which perpetuated their screen images. Tom Tierney has done a wonderful job of capturing the era.The notes accompanying the dolls could be improved, however. For example, there is no mention of the films Louise Brooks made in Germany, which were her greatest successes.I'd love to see entire books dedicated to some of these ladies, especially Marlene Dietrich and Myrna Loy.A note to the artist: the beaded suit worn by Marlene Dietrich in ""Angel"" was biege and encrusted with paste rubies, emeralds and rhinestones. It has been preserved and I have a color photo of it."
1,Buyer Beware!,There are three positive reviews of this DVD which appear to be created by people associated with this DVD; let me tell you the reality. I bought this DVD because I am interested in Jung and also the Red Book. This DVD is a total and complete ripoff. The speaker is a befuddled man who had no ability to give a presentation; it is complete disorganized and he is standing in a conference room; for much of the DVD some speaker phone goes off speaking over him! This is a true rip off and the producers are shameless in selling this to unwitting consumers. Buyer beware!
5,Phoebe's Chaplain,This was purchased because I know the author who is Chaplain at Phoebe Richland Health Care Center. It was shipped and packaged as expected.
1,NO MORE SUN-In Original !!!!!,"I have been using SUN-IN ORIGINAL for years and now they replace it with SUN-IN Tropical Breeze! I tried ordering the Original and instead they sent me Tropical Breeze even though the ORIGINAL is on this page.The ORIGINAL worked great making beautiful highlights, but the Tropical Breeze does nothing and made my hair drab.Don't Order from AmericaRx.com or MyOTCstore.com they will only send you Topical Breeze not ORIGINAL!!!!!"
1,Not what it says it is.,"It says it is Super Sun-In, but it is just the normal original version which isn't nearly as effective. Can't seem to find the Super Sun-In anywhere anymore, that's why I ordered it online."
1,This is the worst possible thing for your hair!,"If you use this product you will never be able to dye or bleach your hair after words. This is a metallic dye, with Hydrogen Peroxide, which if you didn't know is bleach. There is nothing natural about how this lightens your hair. If you have brown hair, it will turn orange and it cannot be fixed because you wont be able to dye your hair. If you do bleach or dye your hair with anything more then a semi permanent dye(essentially food coloring in conditioner), it will likely fry your hair. I promise you will be disappointed with this."
4,Since I was a little girl,"I was born a blonde but as I got older my hair color changed and now I have a dark brown hair color. My mother used sun in on my hair years ago and it worked amazing, Kept the blonde as long as it could before we gave up and said its just going to happen and I cant change it so I let the brown come in. Now 25 years later I have a beautiful little girl who is a blonde and I just know she is going to probably loose her blonde hair to but I think why not give it a shot. I will be buying this product for her. I swear by this stuff. I just cant believe the product is still going strong"
2,Disappointing,Recipes didn't work and neither did some of the tips for the frostings. Very disappointed in the size of the book with few recipes.Silvana
5,Great film...!!! Awakens the soul!!!,"""Watched it yesterday. LOVED IT!!! Bravo in conveying the message. It was well received!!! I am AWAKE now!!! Thank you..."
4,My son loves it!,"My 18 month old son loves this CD. We play it in the car to pass the time. He cheers after each song. While the overly sweet voices can sometimes be a bit much for an adult, he loves it. And if it keeps him happy, it's worth it!"
4,Excellent musical reggae/ska fusion!,"I caught these hip cats at the Alligator in Breckenridge back during Thanksgiving week '97. These guys had the place moving and shaking. As a musician myself with a jazz/blues/carribean influence, I grooved to their beats and rifts immediately. I purchased a c.d. at the show and everyone back here in Milwaukee asked, '""Who's this? Where'd you 'find' this?""' I haven't seen them live since, I'm sure their even more tighter and balanced. (Jon, if you happen to read this, take my advice I've given you many times over the past two years via J.R. email, look into getting out here in Milwaukee for Summerfest. The music masses of Minneapolis, Chicago, St. Louis, Indianapolis, and Detroit converge for 11 days of music, sun, and good times on Lake Michigans' Milwaukee shoreline.)"
1,Item not as advertised from sunvalley tech,"I took a chance after seeing the previous two reviews saying that the seller does not ship the correct item, because this item is provided by more than one seller and I couldn't tell which seller had been the problem.Well, I can definitively say that sunvalley tech is NOT the seller to buy from.They shipped the keyboard unbelievably fast - but it is the wrong keyboard. It is wider than my entire laptop. Either they sent the wrong item, or the product listing that says it is compatible with the Acer Aspire 1410 is incorrect.Either way, DO NOT BUY."
1,"do NOT order this, do not use this store","They sent me a wrong item as someone else already wrote below.Basically and from the beginning, it is out of stock no matter what it says.refund doesnot return my time and effort.DO NOT ORDER THIS"
4,Great color,"I used this hair dye and color 2 weeks ago. It has a really pretty red tint to it. I LOVE the color. However, after about a week the red tint is now gone and my hair is just a dull brown color. I dont know how to get the red to stay in it."
4,Space saver saves space,"I bought this chair for my grandson as a gift. My daughter wanted this one because it can be used on an existing kitchen chair, since she did not have room to add a traditional high chair to the table. It is easy to get him in and out of the chair, and it is very easy to clean. It is impossible to move the tray onto the chair with just one hand, so you can't have any baby food or bottles etc. in your hand when you are ready to slip the tray on. All in all, they really like it. I would recommend this because I see it as a good value for the money and it should last through several babies."
2,Better options available,"My in laws got this for my then 12 month old son for use at their house. The seat padding is vinyl, and he sticks to it as does everything else. There are so many creases in the padding that it is not always easy to clean. To make matters worse, this seat is HUGE. If you are looking to save space, this is not the seat for you. Once it is strapped to a chair, it takes up as much room as a normal high chair. Also, the arms are too high, so it does not fit under the dining room table.Now that my son is 2 1/2, it is even less functional. He is too big to be using the tray. In my opinion, a toddler should eat at the table with the rest of the family and not be treated like a baby. This is very difficult with this seat as it does not slide under the table.At half the price, theFisher-Price Healthy Care Booster Seatis a much better option. It is compact, can go anywhere with you, and transitions easily from baby to toddler."
4,Good option for a small space,"A friend had this high chair, and recommended it for me. We live in a small space, and it has worked well. It adjusts well for reclining and feeding. It also puts baby at the same height as everyone else at the table. This is great for me, because I am short, I do not have to reach up to feed her (mealtime creates enough messes already!) I love that this chair grows with the child. It has been very easy to use and easy to clean."
5,Love it!,I am so glad we bought this chair. It's easy to strap and unstrap it from our dining chair if we are done with it and need the extra seat. It's easy to wipe down and when our daughter was younger we used to take it out with us. It reclines and she would fall asleep drinking her milk so we could enjoy our meal. It is a little bulky to carry but well worth it. It must be comfortable because our daughter has fallen asleep in it several times.
5,"Great Chair, Great Price","This chair has gotten me through 2 sons....I love this chair!Great Features, Easy to Clean."
2,No Space Saved,"This high chair is such a great concept but winds up being super awkward! The tray is bulky and won't consistently lock into place, and it's so high that it comes up to my poor daughter's armpits! The arms on the chair are also awkward, they prevent it from sliding under the table, thereby negating any space saved by the concept of this high chair.I'm returning this and getting a booster seat instead. It's basically the same thing and actually DOES save space!"
3,Good but used.,"I have ordered MANY items from Amazon.com and this is the first time I received something clearly ""used"" before, when I had ordered ""new"". Because of the hassle, I decided to keep the high chair and wash it myself, but I am very surprised and disappointed that this would be mailed out in the condition it was in."
5,love this!,"I registered for this for my shower and have been using it since my baby was 1 month old. We started having him ""eat with the family"" since then because we felt it was a good habit to form. Since it reclines, and is so comfortable, it was great for him to just sit and watch us, and many times he fell asleep right in the chair! As a bonus, since my husband and I like to go out, we just took it with us to friends houses and restaurants. That was GREAT because we could have a dinner with out having to hold the baby. It is light weight and easily adjusted. I have recommended this to every mom I know. My MIL even got one to keep at her house for the grandkids. For travel, now that my baby is 10 months old, I just bought the Fisher Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster seat. It fit in my suitcase, and I figure my baby can use this as his booster when we have our new baby and s/he is in this highchair! A great great product!"
3,Not a huge fan.,"We are a bit disappointed with this. Straps are not easily removed, make the seat uncomfortable if you don't have the need to strap your child in. Worse is that the tray mechanism is very difficult to slide in and out. You have to force one side or the other every time. Not very graceful. Would not buy again. Looking to replace it actually. Cheap is an understatement."
4,SPACE SAVER HIGH CHAIR,THE CHAIR ARRIVED SOONER THAN EXPECTED. THE QUALITY WAS VERY GOOD. IT WAS GIVEN AS A GIFT AND THE PARENTS LOVED IT.
4,Convenient chair,"With limited space, we opted for this space-saver chair. It is easy to clean and great for my daughter. The extra straps were wonderful when she was smaller and now are easily removable when they are no longer needed. It has great versatility in regard to tray, reclining and height positions based upon your needs. A great product!"
2,"Cheap, wobbly, and doesn't save space in my kitchen.","I was excited to get this high chair, but totally disappointed once it arrived. Its easy to put together, took about 5 minutes total. The first problem was that it didn't scoot under my kitchen table. The biggest issue for me though was the CHEAP FEEL of the whole thing. I know its only 50 bucks or so, but I would have paid maybe $75-$80 if it were better quality. The tray, seat, side rails, and basically the chair as a whole feels wobbly. The tray does not slide on and off easily due to this. The only benefit I could see with this chair is that its lightweight and could be brought to a restaurant, sitters, family members house for feedings. It would ravel well.We went with a full size Chicco. Its worth the extra 70 bucks!"
5,Great product....,I love the Fisher-Price Space Saver Highchair. It is my second one that I purchased for my second home. Its great because it takes up no more space than the chair it sits on and it allow my child to be more part of dinner time. It is also great because it is a lot cheaper than your typcially highchair. It is very easy to install. I highly recommend this highchair.
5,The best of both worlds,"If you are having trouble deciding between a traditional high chair or a booster-style, strap-on chair, your search has come to an end. As you would expect with a high chair, this product has a convertible 5- or 3-point harness, a cushioned seat, a one-hand-release tray, a reclining seat, and a seat that moves up and down. Like a booster seat, this product is compact, easy to clean, and can be pulled up to the table when baby is older and only needs a little boost.Other customers might want to know that the cushioned seat is made of wipeable vinyl with fabric trim. I was worried that the trim would become hopelessly stained, but so far so good. Also, this product does not fold and carry super-conveniently as some of the hard plastic models do. However, these are very minor gripes with a product out of which I expect to get years of use."
3,"For the price, I expected a little nicer quality","It works - but I'd save your money and go with the cheap models. This is basically a cheap model with a high price :) It's not comfortable, my daughter doesn't really like sitting in it. But it works for what we needed."
2,Fine except for the bruises,"Like another reviewer, this high chair gave my son all kinds of bruises on his leg from the ridges on the underside of the tray. (If he picked his legs up, kicked, etc, it caused the bruises). It was great otherwise...nice recline feature, somewhat of a space-saver, nice color, etc. I just couldn't get past the fact that it hurt my little one. I ended up getting a simple Graco highchair and the smooth underside of the tray makes all the difference. Just be careful!"
5,Perfect for feeding and beyond!,"While I haven't actually used this chair for feeding baby yet, (he is only 3 months old) I use it almost every day. It is a lifesaver when I need to make dinner and he can't stand laying on his back for one for minute. He is content to sit in the chair fully reclined and watch me or when that doesn't work I attach the tray to hold toys to keep his attention. He seems quite comfortable. Can't wait to actually start using it for it's intended purpose."
5,Perfect for my small dining area,"I have had this high chair since my daughter was just starting baby cereal. She is now 21 months & I feel just as confident with it as I did when she was smaller. I have a family of six with a small dining area & could not begin to imagine trying to figure out where to put a self-standing high chair. She can easily climb in & out of it herself and loves to buckle herself. On the plus side, she CAN'T unbuckle it herself! The only real problem I've had with it is that it holds tomato sauce stains better than I would like :~ I lost the manual to it & Fisher-Price immediately sent me a replacement with no problems. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a high chair that goes from baby to big kid and has limited space!"
3,Its ok but a pain to put the tray on the high chair,"This high chair is pretty neat except for the tray. I love the fact it fits in a chair and no extra space is needed for a high chair. What I don't love is the fact that I have to fight with the tray to get it on the high chair. It gets ""stuck"" and will not slide like it is suppose to. With a wiggly baby in the chair (even though strapped in with the safety belts) it is difficult and frustrating trying to get the tray to slide in when it gets stuck. I am afraid of the tray suddenly sliding and hitting the baby, I have to use that much force to get it to slide."
4,Happy with our purchase,"We got the Space Saver High Chair earlier than expected and set it up right away. The set-up was painless and didn't take long at all. I couldn't get the chair to recline, but other than that, it was what I was expecting. It's very easy to clean and looks spotless even after many uses. The color fits perfectly with my dining room furniture. The chair feels sturdy and like it will last a long time. I gave it four stars because the tray was a little dirty (and it won't come off) when it came, and the seat doesn't recline as it says it should, but overall, it is a very good product and we are happy with our purchase."
1,"Hard, Tight, and Crushes Baby Crotches","The hard plastic and vinyl cover are uncomfortable enough in this tight chair, but the seat has a hard plastic protrusion in the middle that crushes the baby's crotch even when my baby was a few months old! The tray presses into the baby. The buckles/fasteners are rough, abrasive, and badly designed - needs padding. It feels flimsy because the tray shakes and the armrests shake. There needs to be arm and elbow room, but this seat severely restricts movement. My baby at a few months of age found this uncomfortable. I bought this because of rave reviews and recommendations from magazines; so I thought that I needed this, too. WRONG! Babies this young do not need a high chair or much solids for that matter."
4,Decent High Chair,"My sister and mom both had this high chair and so I decided to buy one myself. The color ""tan"" was different than the photo shown on Amazon. I probably don't like the color/design as much, but it doesn't really bother me. It is a great high chair. Holds child secure. It does not slide underneath our table and so it does just kind of sit to the side of the table. I had read this before buying it and so I knew what I was getting into. I thought the height adjusters might do it, but they just don't. The lowest setting won't slide under the table. Other than that it is a functional high chair. Seems durable & sturdy. Because of the plasticy material my daughter tends to sweat in it. I like this material as it is easy to wipe down. All in all, good high chair. Have not tried booster seat."
2,I returned it,"This chair has too many crevices where little bits of food would be caught. The plastic-y backing is easy to wipe down but is an eyesore. The Fisher Price Space Saver booster is a better bet if you do not want another standalone piece of furniture.After returning it, I went for a wooden convertible high chair to chair piece that has a removable tray and have been happy with it."
1,Sweat sweat and more sweat,Avoid this chair like the plague. Your baby will stick to the vinyl and sweat buckets unless you live in an igloo. Thee is no liner on the plastic material and you can't put the chair under the table anyway so you save no space. My son HATES the bloody thing.
5,Space Saver High Chair,I love this high chair because it converts from infant to toddler booster chair modes. It is great to have it so my son does not have to bring his own when visiting since they live out of state. Also since it converts to use as a booster it will be useful for many years. Since it is attached by seatbelts to our dining chair it does not take up a lot of storage space in between visits with out grandson.
3,Great...at first.,"I can honestly say I was totally in love with this highchair when I first purchased it. It is a great highchair until they are around a year old..if that. It depends on how big your child is but mine out grew it pretty quickly, I was upset since I had a beautiful high chair that was full size and I sold it when I purchased this item. I ended up selling this item and purchasing another full size high chair. If you want a nice high chair I would totally recommend the fisher price rainforst or even the aquarium, they are both awesome chairs! And my 3 year old can still fit in them!"
2,"Great for babies, No good as a booster","I loved this when I first started using it when my daughter was 6 months old and just starting solids, so much so that we bought the same one to leave at my parents' house. Now that she's 1, though, and wants desperately to sit at the table with us, I've found that it's completely useless as a booster. The arms are exactly the same height as the table, even in the lowest position, so you can't push her under the table. And it's not just my table, as I originally thought it might be. Look at the photo above of the toddler - see how far away he is? I read somewhere that you can take the arms off by removing the height adjuster on the bottom and then removing some screws from the arms, but that really isn't what I was looking for when I bought this chair. We'll have to buy another booster now, both for our house and my parents'. Really frustrating, considering how much this cost."
2,doesn't fit!,"So I registered for this because we have a pretty small house and I figured a ""space saver"" would be the perfect thing! No so much a space saver though!!! First of all the seat doesn't fit on the chair all the way so that made me uncomfortable. Also the height it awkward and the arms of the chair sit right at the table so you can't push the chair under the table. The chair can't recline either which isn't very helpful with an infant. Maybe it's just my table?!?"
2,Doesn't work as a booster,This chair was great as a high chair when our twins were young. We were able to recline the seats to feed them bottles at the same time. Now that they are older and we want them to sit at the table with us we have realized that there is no way that the chair will work as a booster with our table. The arms of the chair are too high and it cannot be scooted under the table. The only options are to raise the chair all the way up above the level of the table and scoot it up against (bad idea because they kick the table and try to tip themselves over) or to go out and buy new chairs. I'm very disappointed!
5,one less piece of baby junk in the house,"I love this highchair. With the coming of baby and all the trappings, it is nice to be able to use space wisely. This chair is so wonderful--I can take it to Grandma's easily with just a couple of unlatches, and it cleans up very nicely. I particularly like the ability to have the babe up close and personal at the family table, as opposed to set aside in a huge wide framed high chair. This is an essential bit of baby gear, in my opinion. And for you minimalists out there, this chair works as a substitute for a ""bouncy seat"" and that type of thing with the wee ones as well, before they're using it to eat in."
5,Very happy with this purchase,"This chair is great. I like that it doesn't take up a ton of room, but I also appreciate that it is not covered with an obnoxious design. Yay earthtones!"
4,high enough chair,I contaced the manufacturer before I bought this one. From the bottom of the high chair after adjusting to full length to the bottom of the tray is 12''. It is high enough to put the tray on top of the table. Tray looks much bigger than the FP Deluxe model. I do like the tilt function.
2,Not a good highchair,"So apparently, the new ones don't have arms, which is a plus. But I have the old kind that does have arms, so that's what I'm reviewing.First of all, the highchair feels very cheap. I'm not quick to say that about things, but with this, it's true. The tray is a pain to get off and put on. I thought I'd use this as a booster, but I can't, because the arms don't let it slide under the table. The only plus is that the fabric is easy to take off and wash, and it's held up very well.I'm about to get my son an actual booster seat, so I will be storing this at my dad's house for when we visit. Honestly, with the next baby, I will probably just get a regular high chair."
4,Why buy anything different?,"I got this off my registry and just recently installed it. I do like it. As I have a tiny kitchen, I knew I did not have room for a giant (and much more expensive) high-chair. This has no bells nor whistles, but it does recline and have a dishwasher safe tray. The only thing I would like more is if the straps weren't so rough and the tray had one of those removable trays for the dishwasher. Otherwise, good buy!"
4,GREAT STARTER HIGH CHAIR,love my baby's new chair. he started using it at a little over 5 months old. he is 18 pounds and is not sitting on his own quite yet. this chair gives lots of support and is very durable. i could recline him and adjust the tray very easily. I could even change the height without too much work. i would certainly recommend this highchair for newborn's as well. I had carpal tunnel in both wrists after baby was born and had a hard time holding him while breast/bottle feeding. this chair would have made it so much easier if I had it. the only thing I would complain about is that the seatbelt is not easy to disassemble. baby had carrots for the first time and he spit up all over. I even tried to get the belt out with pliers...and didn't work. I plan to purchase another chair for his caretaker:)
1,No Space Saver/ Unable to Properly Clean Pad,"This chair is definitely not a space saver. It takes just as much room as a high chair since it does not fit under a standard table. In addition, the pad is mostly vinyl, which can be hand washed, but the rim and underside is made of material and is only supposed to be surfaced washed. Food falls down the cracks and underneath the seat and the material part of the pad gets food smashed into it and it cannot be thrown in the washer. Yuck- design flaw for sure!"
5,Perfect highchair for infancy and beyond!,"We bought this highchair because my husband was tired of tripping over the monster highchair we originally had and was thrilled to find this. It's compact, easy to clean, has a one hand tray release and reclines also. So far, we are still in the highchair phase but it will serve us well when our daughter needs a booster. For $50, you can't beat it!"
1,Not a space saver and dirty,"I became very annoyed. The one handed push in is not efficient nor easy to use. There is a lot of little spaces and crevices that get filled with food and it is really hard to clean. The cover is not big enough so the food gets under it. Also, I agree with a previous reveiwer it does not fit at the table so essentially I have a chair sitting in the middle of the room. I am buying a new high chair tomorrow."
2,Too small for my linebacker!,"I bought this seat for my 9 month old son, but his cloth diapered bum was already too big to fit in the seat! His linebacker shoulders also seemed so squished. Like seeing a pro-football lineman in a slugbug VW! We tried it for 3 meals that day, but he was so frustrated that he couldn't move. We went back to our 1st chair, a The First Years Newborn-Toddler Reclining Feeding Seat. Awwww, room to move! I'm sure this Fisher-price seat is great, but it didn't work for us. The seat was too small. The pad is surface washable only, and the tray is very large and awkward. If you are looking for a great alternative to this seat, try The First Years one."
5,This is a handy lil chair,Omg I am in love with this seat. My daughter fits in it perfect and she enjoyed it as well. I like all the features it has to offer and the design is just to cute.
3,Good but should've gotten a cheaper one!,"This chair is quite nice and gets job the done ok. Pros are easy assemble, recline feature is nice even to an 8-month feed herself with a bottle, machine-washale fabric and one hand tray release. Cons: tray too high up for baby to self feed nicely, oversized tray is a pain to fit in dishwasher or even sink, would've preferred an easily wipeable fabric instead of having to take it out to wash and having print fade! Also, tray is not the smoothest to attach. Overall a decent chair but there are others out there that work just as great for much less money."
2,"Very disappointed! Unsafe for tall, heavy infants.","I bought this high chair last week from Amazon. I have a six month old and we are short on space. I was very excited about this chair. It was easy to put together, the fabric wasn't awful, and I could deal with the design of the harness. A big negative is that plastic is flimsy and cheap. Then I put my baby in the seat. My infant is 21 pounds, and as soon as he was placed in the seat, the chair reclined very quickly and he nearly hit his head on the chair back. My first thought was that I had put something together wrong. Instead, I discovered that the design of this particular chair does not allow for the recline option to stay in place, meaning that if you place a tall, heavy infant in the chair, it may or may not swing back suddenly. We conducted experiments with a five pound bag of flour, and it still tilted back suddenly. I couldn't tell you if the chair is defective or just poorly designed.I am sending it back."
1,Went cheap with a great idea,"This product looks great, and in fact is perfect, if your baby is neat and tidy and doesn't play with his food or make a mess. I don't know whose baby that would be, but my twin boys like to play in their food, and some genius decided to put a cover on these chairs that cannot be washed! Only surface cleaned. Now, 6 months later, the covers are NASTY. Buyer beware!"
1,Color and material looks nothing like the picture!,"I researched several of these and thought this one looked nice and had natural colors, but more fun than the boring tan for a boy. Now, I wish I went for the boring tan. The color is a neon green and this cheap-looking plastic vinyl material and also says surface washable, nothing about machine washable in the paperwork that came with it. Would return it and get another, however what I would pay to ship it back would not be worth it. Am embarrassed to have it in my dining room...."
5,Mrg5550,"We purchased this high chair for our grandson's visits. It has worked out great. It looks nice, the material is easy to wipe off and it doesn't take up much space."
4,Great for Apartment Living!!!!,My fiance and I have an apartment so this high chair works really well for our small dining area. Its comfy reclines which is a plus for newborns. My daughter (7 months old)loves to sit and just play with her toys. My only complaint is the straps when we recieved it the straps would not fit through the slot and was very difficult but after alot of tugging they went through. The annoying part is when you want to clean the chair cover you have to take the straps apart and fool with trying to thread through the slot again soooooo annoying.
4,"Saves space, not for big babies","We love this chair for its portability and its ease of cleaning, but from the start it was difficult to fit our hefty one-year-old in it. We took off the padding and the back of the chair to make it into an early booster sit with a tray. It's definitely a good buy, but would work a bit better for a less chunky baby."
4,Fairly good product definitely a space saver,"This is a very good product definitely saves a lot of space. However, it does get heavy when attached to the chair if you have to move it around with the chair. The tray could have also been a little better designed because sliding it in and out is a little difficult. Overall a fairly good product."
2,portable highchair,Nice chair but is at to hard an angle where child shoulders rest can not sit back confortable. For child to sit back shoulders are pushed front.
3,space saver high chair,"I love this high chair. it's great not having a big bulky extra piece of furniture in our dinnette. the only issue that we have is when we received this item, the lettering is worn off of it like it had been used several times. i purchased this as a ""new"" item so i wasn't expecting this at all."
3,Why bother to register??,"I purchased this item because the parents included it in their baby registry. It was ordered the day that I received a shower invitation. I wrapped the (damaged) box that was received, placed it in my car and took it to the Baby Shower (100+ miles).Imagine my surprise when mine was the second ""Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Scatterbug"" opened. Sadly, both were bought through Amazon from the registry.I will not purchase from an Amazon registry in the future!"
1,Shame on Amazon This Time.,"We purchased this high chair from Amazon.com as we purchased a lot of other things. We assume we will get a new thing, but what delivered is a broken box with a used high chair in it (you can see that somebody has done some not-so-good cleaning). And there is a devil face on the box.Shame on Amazon this time. Don't send me used stuff or don't let me know you send me used stuff when I buy new stuff from you."
5,Great High Chair,"I purchased this high chair after reading several really good reviews on it. My son was 7 months at the time (he's now 8 months old) and we love it. It was extremely easy to assemble - took me all of 5 minutes. It takes up very little space - fits directly onto the chair - and is sturdy and secure. The only thing is that my son is still a little small, so I don't use the tray that much because it's too high for him to reach over. However, once he gets a little taller, we'll be using it more often. I would highly recommend this high chair."
3,"Agree, not so much space saving here","I have to agree with one of the previous posters that said ""space saver, not so much"". It's a great little chair but we have two dining tables and when you have this on your chair, there is no pushing it under the table. So it really comes down to what's more space saving for you - Having your chair 2 feet out from your table (in our eat in kitchen, this is nearly impossible, in our dining room, a lot easier) or having a full size that you can fold up and leave against the wall. I'm keeping this b/c it was inexpensive but am going to now also buy a full size one that can fold up. So just keep that in mind when you are purchasing."
3,Works well for younger babies,"We bought this for our 6 month old daughter about a year and a half ago. I thought it would be great to be able to take it with us places, but then quickly realized it was much bulkier than I was expecting. It has great support for younger children though and I really liked that you could adjust the angle for the comfort of a younger baby. Unfortunately, now that our daughter is almost two we are in need of a booster seat that will allow her to pull up to the table with us. I had thought this one would serve that purpose but it turns out that the arm rests hit our table (even with the height at the lowest setting) so that she can't get close enough to eat with us. I think we'll shoot for a smaller one that will travel better next time. This just didn't end up working as well as I'd hoped."
4,great for limited space,This is a great choice for those who have a limited about of space. My son is 19 months now and he eats everything at the table and feeds himself. And he also loves to relax in the chair and watch tv. So its like his little personal chair. The only thing I wish was a bit better was the cushion. It's very loose and slides off. My son like most babies is very active and with the slightest turn the cushion slides. But all in all I think its a great buy!
5,Perfect!,Love it! It really is a great space saver and the baby seems very comfortable and happy in it!
3,"No frills, does the job","Crumbs tend to accumulate under the fabric because the seat fabric tends to curl and make a gap, the lower fabric clips tend to easily come undone, made worse by how loose they are to begin with. The position of the tray seems to not be level in any position, which is probably okay as it biases the dry foods to slide towards the baby, and we never put bowls of fluids on the baby's tray. Overall, it does what we need it to do, is easy to put together, easy to use, and has enough adjustability and durability that it should last for our future babies as well. Not great, but certainly not bad either, built to last"
4,Almost perfect....,"This is a great chair if you want to save space. We used it at our wood dining room table for my toddler between 6-20 months. I like that the color is gender-neutral, chair is relatively easy to clean, and feels secure in attaching to the dining room chair. I do recommend putting a towel under the chair to prevent marks and prevent stains.My only wish is that they make the arms on the chair adjustable. This would help with the two issues I had: the tray seemed high on my 6 month old, and I couldn't get the chair super close to the table (when we wanted him to be closer to the table without the tray) because the arms were the wrong height for my dining room table (standard height)."
3,OK except the arms.,"I love the way that the seat attaches to a chair and the recline is great. It works fine with the tray but I cannot push it up to my table. The arms get in the way and I can't get the seat close enough to the table and she makes a mess. The newer models do not appear to have the pesky arms on them, which I think will solve the problem."
4,Works Great,Very secure. No problems. I would recommend this product. Easy to put baby in and out. Easy to clean up.
5,Awesome - very versatile!,"This is my second Fisher Price space saver high chair. I had one for my daughter, my neighbors gushed over it and bought one too. Then I gave it away to an expectant friend who loved it. Now we bought this newer model for our 2nd and love it just as much! You can strap it into a regular chair or bar stool, and easily throw it in the car to take to someone's house for dinner. Highly, highly recommended! ""High"" chairs are just awkward, this seat puts your baby at your level!"
5,Perfect,It may not be a regular high chair but it works perfect for my daughter. I love I can adjust the seat into three different positions. I laid her back when she was younger and I could even adjust the incline of the tray to make it level. I recommend this for anyone who doesn't want a bulky highchair taking up space in their dinning room!
5,Little Brother first Baby,"Every thing went well- the product can on the day it would be deliver, and the new parent are very happy with the items. The new addition to the family can shortly their after."
5,Great Buy That Gives You Options,"I love this high chair because it's easy to use and store. I didn't want a huge high chair in the corner of my kitchen all the time, especially since we were in the middle of house hunting and had no idea what our future kitchen/dining area was going to look like. With this chair, I can either keep it attached to a chair at our table, or if we have company coming over, I can take it off and store it in our pantry. Reattaching it is as simple as snapping two buckles. Also if my baby is going to spend the day over at grandma's (who does not have a high chair), I can easily take it along. The rest of the features seem pretty much standard on a high chair, and I haven't found anything I don't like about it. I have recommended this too many people and will continue to do so."
2,caused bruising,"Though I like the idea of this product, unfortunately the bottom of the tray table did cause bruising on my 4 month old's knees. My son is the size of an average 9 month old, but in this case, I don't believe his size would have mattered. When I sat him in it upright with the tray table on the chair, he would sometimes kick and bump the tops of his knees on two plastic pieces that jut out on the underside of the tray. It didn't matter how close or far away the tray was. When I realized what was causing the bruising, I called customer relations. They have advised me to return the product to them for further investigation. I plan to do that, but now I need a new high chair!"
3,Great space saver but a pain to clean,"I like this chair because it is compact yet comfortable. The tray is easy to remove and clean but... the vinyl chair cover is such a pain to keep clean. There are a lot of folds and crevices for food to get stuck in and the cover IS NOT machine washable. In order to keep this clean, I have to remove all the belts and the cover itself and hand wash dried on food. Not exactly practical. The actual chair itself I take outside, scrub and hose down. Like I said, great chair as a space saver but terrible for cleaning."
5,We love this!,"I have the green, and I really like the way it looks, the print is super cute. The straps securing it to a chair stay in place. The tilt feature has allowed us to use this from 3 months up (when we purchased it) so our little guy could sit at the table with us for special dinners. The water proof padding is comfortable and easy to clean up. For the price and the space saving aspect, I am glad I made this purchase."
3,Tray hurts little legs!,"The chair has some draw backs. Yes, it does fit nice on our chairs and does not take up room like a traditional high chair. The recline allowed him to be at the table with us as a newborn, I liked that!However, there is a plastic part on the bottom of the tray that scratches my son's legs. If his legs are covered he still ends up with bruises from this edge! He is 6mos and obviously wiggles and kicks his legs, I plan on calling FP with this issue.Once we are ready to use it as a booster, we will still need to use the tray. We have a typical dining room set, but this chair will not fit under the table edge.I see us buying something else in the near future."
3,Space Saver,"This was for my third child. I have only bought a real high chair for my second child, and thought it took up too much space. For all three I have used high chairs that attach to the dining room chair. This product saves a lot of space in the dining room. I love that it reclines and is easy to wash. However, at 6 months old, in its furthest position, the tray sits too close to the baby. She can't move her arms out from under the tray. I am wondering how squishy she is going to be when she gets bigger."
5,Best High Chair! Adorable.,"By far the best high chair for space saving. The cover is adorable and holds up well after multiple washes. It has even held it's bright colors. Easy tray removal and set up, cleans easily. Awesome and Cute!"
1,Don't be fooled!!!,..Don't be fooled!This CD is not from the famous KEY WEST (duo) which was in Charts 1999-2000...
1,Disappointing,"As spring rolls in I get the vibe for some Tropical music. Keywest is a band I heard of, but never heard. Then I bought a cd called ""Thongs in the Key of Life"" which had a tune or two from Keywest that I liked. Americana is the only Key West album that Amazon had, so I got it. It is brutal. Bad Jimmy Buffet covers followed by bad originals. I found out that the original members of Key West are all in a band called Hanna's Reef, their replacements are obviously not up to the task. Don't waste your hard earned cash on this. I am using mine as a coaster."
5,Wow! This ia a Great CD!,I've been watching Key West in Austin Texas for the last five years. I saw these guys at Johnny Fins on Lake Travis near Austin in the Summer of 2002. WOW! Great Sound! Great Musicians! Great Party! I'm the biggest Jimmy Buffett fan on the planet. This roster of Key West'rs rivals the Coral Reefer band which I love dearly. We wanted to buy a CD but they told us to wait. A new CD would be coming and I just got it! I never write reviews but this is the best CD I've bought in a very long time.I recommend the AMERICANA CD to EVERYBODY! Which songs do I like? Just take your pick. I can't get enough of all of them. I give 10 Stars!!GRRRRRREAT JOB KEY WEST! Can't wait till the next one.AMERICANA RULES!
3,GREAT BEACH PARTY BAND,THIS ALBUM IS A FUN ALBUM--AND THEY ARE A GREAT PARTY BAND-BUT THE ONLY REASONS I GAVE IT 3 OUT OF FIVE STARS IS THAT THE SONGS SEEMED RUSHED AND THEY COULD HAVE JAMMED OUT LONGER ON SOME OF THE SONGS. ALSO THEIR TROPICAL SOUND IS NOT AS APPARENT ON THIS ALBUM AS IT IS ON BEACH BALLS AND ALCOHOL (THEIR BEST ALBUM BY THE WAY) AND THEY DID TOO MANY COVER TUNES. tHIER ORIGINAL SONGS LIKE tROPICAL GIRL AND BEACH PEOPLE ARE AWSOME. NOT A BAD ALBUM BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN A BIT BETTER. NOT DOUBT THEY ARE A MUST TO SEE LIVE...
2,"Buy the book, its for a good cause","I thought these were ok books, but they were a bit... well, more than a bit dissapointing. Quidditch Through the Ages was a good book, but Fantastic Beasts and Where to find them seemed very rushed, and was nowhere near as thorough as it should have been. Also, it was very inaccurate. Several times in the Harry Potter books it mentions beasts or whatever and says that they are in this book. Naturally they are not described. Anyways, the money goes to a good cause, so..."
3,Fun But Fluff -- for Charity,"First let me say that it is for a good cause so the books are worth the expence. However, my seven-year-old, who loved the four Harry Potter books, found them alot less interesting, and our interests our divided.My son seemed to enjoy hearing about all the different monsters, constantly urging me to read about ""just one more."" However, once we finished with Fantastic Beasts, he showed no inclination to hear about quidditch. I, however, laughed my way through Quidditch, despite my total ineptitude and lack of interest in most sports, of either muggle or wizard origin.Other than the fact that this is for charity, I wouldn`t break open the piggy bank for these, unless you are a collector or heavy duty fan. They`re fun, but no big deal."
5,These books helps me to further imagine the HP series,"Reading the textbooks of Harry Potter's is great, especially the notes scribbled by Harry, ron and Hermione. So cute! I actually read again all the series after reading the textbook to have other dimension of imagining the whole story and characters.It helps you to imagine how Norbert look like and figure out why the centaurs prefer to live in low profile. And the goblin seems so politically cheeky. One should read these books to have a better 'feel' the Harry Potter stories."
3,Good or Bad,"These books looked great whenI ordered them and a I like them, but be prepared, they aren't that big at all. But they are good books, they are imaginitive and helful with the series if you missed something or want more deatil.Quidiitch through the ages gives you a deatailed history of the sport.Fantastic Beats and were to find them is the best of the two, it gives a good discription of creatures from the book, and some you haven't heard of.Thanks for reading!!!!!"
5,Too short!,"Like everything by JK Rowling, the schoolbooks were both highly anticipated and wonderful to read. I was facinated by the insights into the historical growth of the quidditch game in Quidditch through the ages which was both historical and hysterical at the same time. Fantastic Beasts and where to find them was a wonderful overview of the magical creatures that make up the Potter Universe, and I loved the little side notes by Harry and Ron. While not wanting to take any more of Rowling's time away from writing book five, the main problem I had with the schoolbooks was that they were too short!"
5,Hogwarts Schoolbooks,"Fantaastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quiddich Through the Ages are wonderful. I had reread the Potter series for the umpteenth time, anxiously awaiting the last book, and decided to purchase these because I was in a Harry Potter mood.I was not disappointed, Ms. Rowling had done it again--in a trice I was back at Hogwarts happily studying with Harry, Ron and Hermione.No Potter lover will ever be complete without them--just buy them. Trust me."
2,"cheap, cheap, cheap","While I love Harry Potter books, I can't say that I appreciated the cheapness of the publication of these pamphlets. Everything about the production of these little things was tacky, including the teeny tiny printing. Get a clue, publishers!! At least the proceeds go to charity or I would feel really ripped off."
3,interesting little books for the Harry Potter fan to read,I don't know how useful these booklets are as reference guides to the Harry Potter series but they're fun to read. I'd say they take a more light hearted approach than the big books do and would be easier to read for the young reader.
5,First Year at Hogwarts!,"Harry Potter's world is a great place in which to imagine living, and what better way to begin than to actually join Harry at school?!I was 46 yrs old when I was first introduced to Harry and his friends, by my then 12 yr old grandson. After finishing The Sorcerer's Stone which he'd loaned me, my sweet grandson (now 20!) gave me this set of schoolbooks for Christmas! It is still a prized possession, and which only he (out of 20 grandchildren now) and I are allowed to touch!It's been 10 years now, and after having made a pretty good collection of Harry Potter memorabilia, it's still my favorite...and almost as dogeared as Harry's own copies surely were!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
3,Nice Companion Books,Nice companion books for the Harry Potter series. It was nice to look up creatures that are mentioned in the books. Liked the creature book better than the Quiddich book but I enjoyed both of them.
4,Great Resource,Great resource for my class on the Harry Potter series! The kids were reading and quoting the books at each other.
4,Great books to help you wait :),"When waiting for the next Potter book, these are great books to read. Quidditch Through the Ages is insightful and interesting, while Fantastic Beasts is worth reading just for the comments! To find out more about the best wizarding game and about those strange creatures appearing in Hagrid's classes, read Quidditch Through the Ages and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them!"
4,Harry Potter Schoolbooks,Given as a present to a 10 year old girl. No report on how she liked it but was very excited to have it as her own. Not sure when she will start to read it.
5,More of their world........,This book will give you that. J.K. has clever remarks throughout the books. The money you spend on these books goes to a good cause. So if it turns out you don't like the books you don't have to feel guilty!
5,A Reader from Utah,I loved the way that these books were so cleverly written. They actually made you feel like you were part of the wizarding world and could play Quidditch or have a pet Kneazle. I loved the side notes in Fantastic Beast and Where to find them. it was great to actually know Harry and Ron's thoughts about different types of beasts. For all of you Harry Potter fans out their I suggest you read them.
5,It must have been fun to write these.,"These are very interesting little books. <I>Fantastic Beasts</I> focuses on the odd creatures in the wizard world, some of which were introduced in the novels, and some brand new. It's interesting to read Rowling's take on legendary creatures, and the ""notes"" from Harry and Ron throughout the book were neat.<I>Quidditch</I> tells the history and rules of this strange sport. While I imagine it would be quite harrowing to watch, it's a lot of fun to read about.Both books in this set have the trademark wit of the novels. I'd recommend them to anyone who is a fan of Harry Potter."
5,Simply amazing!! 5 Stars!! * * * * *,"These are really cool books. Since we are stranded for a while with only 4 Harry books, these are really cool in the aspect of we actually get to learn what Harry does."
3,Ok...I guess,"The reason i rated them a 3 is because it lacked the certain charisma found in the main books. Also the fore word by Albus Dumbledore just put me off a little more. last time i checked i'm a muggle and not supposed to know about magic. But otherwise it is worth buying if not for the book, for the charity. And it's a good filler of time between finish the Goblet of Fire and starting the Sorceror's Stone again."
5,fun,"Fun idea. The Quidditch book is a little dry, and definitely for pre-teen/teen. The Fantastic Beasts book is a lot more fun and my 8-year-old son loves it."
2,Bah. Wait for the next novel instead.,"I know Rowling wrote these for a good cause, and I admire her for that, but geez, these books are definitely nothing special.I just found them tedious to read. I ended up skimming the Quidditch one, as I'd just read ""Fantastic Beasts"" before it and was already bored out of my mind.The highlights of the books are the little notes and messages that Harry, Ron and Hermione write in them, but those are few and far between.Overall, I found these about as interesting as a real schoolbook. I would reread any of the Harry Potter novels in a second, but I can't imagine myself ever reading these two books again."
3,Harrys Schoolbooks,This was a fun little aside for the hardcover collection. I also had to replace one of my hardcovers (Book 5) as I had loaned it to a friend and never gotten it back.
3,Yawn.,I guess I've outgrown the Harry Potter thing. This book just didn't do it for me. If you buy it the money goes for a good cause though. I'm on to books like Sights by Susanna Vance and Holes by Louis Sachar. Magic for older COOLER kids like me!
5,Excellent!,"A lot of people have complained that the Harry Potter Schoolbooks are too short, and while I wished they were longer when I got to the end, I did so with every other Harry Potter book as well. J.K. Rowling has covered each topic beautifully, very completely, and all I'm left wanting to know is what the other 690 Quidditch fouls are! (The ten most common are explained). I agree with the ""A reader"" from NJ, USA (28th March, 2001): all we need now is ""Hogwarts: A History""... but the whole of Hogwarts library wouldn't go astray either! Fingers crossed for a big, fat HP #5!"
4,"Great books, if a little inaccurate","While Quidditch through the ages is a good book and captures the magic of the sport known as Quidditch, there are mistakes in Fantastic Beasts and where to find them. JK Rowling, when writing the book, left out Blast-Ended Skrewts, House Elves, Banshees, Boggarts, Dementors, Vampires, Hags, Poltergeists, and Ghosts, to name a few. I think the overall experience of reading the book was cheapened by this. I would have given this book bundle a 4.5, but I had to pick between four or five."
1,Didn't arrive.,"The product didn't arrive. I asked for a replacement, and instead I got a refund of 7.35 instead of the 10.19 of the product. Wanted these books so badly."
1,Boring...,I have read all the Harry Potter books but this was extreamly disapointing. It was obviously a short book meant to make money between the fourth and fifth book. Absolutly horrable.
1,Sad,It's very sad. I got this set for my nephew for his birthday. It arrived and the plactic cover was all torn and shredded and the box that held the books was damaged. The actually books were also dented and damged but the outside packaging was fine. I made a point of buying this Brand New so he would have it for his collection. Now it's not even worth adding to his collection. And there's no time to do anything about it. Thanks for nothing!
1,never received this order,I never received this order. I contacted Amazon and was given a full refund.
2,Disappointingly thin!,"These ""books"" would more aptly be called ""pamphlets."" There was much ado about Rowling writing these for charity, but, really, how hard was that? She probably wrote these in a couple of afternoons. Now, if Rowling donated the proceeds from the next three novels in the ""Harry Potter"" series, that would be something else. Rowling is a multimillionaire several times over; she can afford to donate all the income for the rest of her life to worthy causes. These tiny, cheap ""pamphlets"" just don't cut it. Rowling's creativity and humor is one thing, but please don't admire her for throwing these breadcrumbs at the poor."
5,Good for the Harry-Addicts,"A great way to truly get into the Harry Potter spirit! As a reader of the series, this was a great way for me to read something other than the novels while still getting my daily dose of fantasy. I mean, I can only read the ""Goblet of Fire"" so many times, right? I reccomend, however, you read at least one Harry-novel first, just so you get an idea of what Rowling is doing."
4,Worth it,"The two book supplement is worth purchasing. Although I bought the set for the Magical Beasts book I enjoyed the Quidditch one more. The attention to detail in the books for 'notes', library log etc makes them even more fun. For such a low price, I highly recommend picking them up for a Harry Potter fan."
3,For The True Believer,"I won't lie to you, I found these books rather arcane and dull. That probably has more to do with being and adult than the actual quality of the books, because my 9-year old son, who has practically memorized the Harry Potter books, thought they were fascinating."
3,"interesting, but not essential reading","""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" provides a bit of insight to some of the creatures in the Harry Potter universe. There are several mentioned that don't even appear in the series, or are only mentioned in passing. These references prove useful, but it provides few more details about the creatures given more than a passing reference in the series. The ""hand-written"" notes in the book provide a bit of comedy, but not really any useful information.""Quidditch Through the Ages"" provides some historical information that enhances a few references to Quidditch in the Harry Potter series, but unless you're quite interested in the mechanics of Quidditch, isn't really all that useful."
4,Two Books in One,"""Quiddich Through THe Ages"" and ""Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them"" arne't bad books. They give you information that can help you understand the Harry Potter books better. ""Quiddich Through The Ages"" does help you understand what would be an illeagal move was and simmilar stuff like that. ""Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them"" helped me understand the diffrent meanings and purposes of some of these magical animals. If you need help understandidng some thing that's Quiddich or animal realated try one of these books. (But if you want to know what a crumplehornsnorkak is good luck because they sure arn't in ""Fantastic Beasts And Where To find Them""!)"
4,Good for Harry fans,I bought this for my 7 yo. granddaughter for her birthday. She loves Harry and was excited to get a book with some background on the series.
4,Classic Books from Hogwarts Reviewed,"These two books are short,easy and to read. They contain J.K.R.'s descriptive style as well as providing background information. The ""comments"" from the characters makes you feel as though these books were used by them. It's FUN!"
4,Cute,"I personally thought these two books were a cute collection for any HP fan. They also provide you with more information about the HP world, which is also a plus. A great addition to any HP item collector."
4,Charming,These books were really a cute idea. J.K. Rowling is a very imaginative person. Any fan will be delighted by Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages. Fantastic Beasts has notes scribled throughout it by Harry Ron and Hermonie. Quidditch doesn't (it's a library book where Fantastic Beasts belongs to Harry.) And they are for a good cause. What more do you need to be told?
5,What do you know about Quidditch?,This book is a good reference book on Quiddditch! It is very good for Harry Potter fans. It's got facts even YOU didn't know! Like how the golden snitch came to be!And much much more.
4,Very Good Books!,"I just got these two books and I couldn't put them down! No wonder why they are on backorder. I would have given five stars, but some magical creature parts weren't interesting, and they aren't on the same level as the Harry Potter series. I am glad that all earnings of the book will go to a charity for the needy. Another thing that I liked about these books is the creative ideas. All of the quidditch history, beasts, and item descriptions were so much fun to read. I also liked the drawings and the comical side of the two books. Of all these great things, my favorite part of the set would be Harry and Ron's thoughts in ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"". There were handwritten statements by both Harry and Ron (with one by Hermione). I will probably refer to these books when reading other Potter books in the future. Thanks for writing yet another set of great books J.K. Rowling!"
5,Two Excellent Books,I have just finished reading these Hrry Potter books and I have to say that they were very good. For those who don't know much about Quidditch this book will explain it very clearly
4,Differant than I thought!,When I saw these books I thought they were stuped. I read them and wow! They were really good. I thought the animals in Fantastic Beasts and Whare to Find Them were cool. Quidditch Through the Ages was interesting too. Every one should read these books.
3,Worth the money,It wasn't quite what I expected but it was good enough that I'll probably buy another set or two for other people.
3,"Cute, but not enough","These are fun reference books for the Potter seris. The drawings are enjoyable, and it is for a good cause. It is interseting to read about the various creatures, and I very much enjoied the drawings. However, it is not enough to be a Potter fix. Eagerly awaiting the movie, and word of the next book."
4,it's good book,i'm korean.i bought this book on the amzon.i so pleased.this book open my imtation.this book is better than korea ones.i will keep this book foverever
2,Disappointing,"Hardcore Harry fans who want everything Potter will want these, but they're unfulfilling to the average reader. Children and adults alike will quickly recognize these as an attempt to make more money off the Harry Potter craze. The novels are much more fun. These are as dry as....well, a textbook. I'd rather sit through six full periods of Professor Snape."
3,book not arrived,"I would have loved to read the book, but it never arrived. ""It went back for unknown reason"" (`????) US-mail? Amazon?"
5,Good reading,I purchased this set to satisfy my curiosity and am not disappointed. The books are easy to read and add to my Potter collection nicely. They provide a little of the backstory I was looking for.This set would be a great gift for any Potter fan.
5,Two words? Must have.,"Harry Potter is a very popular series, and for any fan of the series, this is a must have. It will give you more information about the world of ""Hogwarts"" and you will feel good about yourself since it's also for a good cause, i only hope J.K. Rowling will write more of these. Books, Movies, and these schoolbooks i consider the official harry potter merchandise, and then Harry Potter themed candy, figures and such is nice also. I have both of these books, and i read them all the time. It's a good price too. I hope you purchase them, have fun reading!"
5,Awesome,"This set is great for any Harry Potter fan! The ""Fantastic Beasts..."" book is excellent enough! It's like a dictionary of the different magical creatures. And since it is supposed to have belonged to Harry, there are notes written here and there by Harry and Ron. The Quidditch book has many interesting facts about the game from the history of Quidditch to info about different moves used in play. The only downside is the books are kind of small - about the size of a typical Dr. Seuss book. I would definitely recommend buying this set for anyone who loves the Harry Potter books."
4,"Nice writing, but too short to savor","J. K. Rowling wrote two excellent filler books for those who are waiting for the fifth Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. The only problem was that they were too short to savor!The first book is Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them, a book that tells about all known magical beasts. The book gives classifications, descriptions, and locations of beasts, as well as the definition of beast and other things.The other book is Quidditch through the ages, a book talking about the evolution of everyone's favorite wizard sport, Quidditch. It tells about how the sport evolved, how it is played, and it gives information on the professional teams and Quidditch playing nations.Personally, I found Quidditch Through the Ages more enjoyable, though both were well written. My only problem with them was that they were much too short to really enjoy!"
5,harry potter schoolbooks,"these books give the reader a great extent to the world of harry potter, they show how well estabished is the work j k rowling has created. I've quite enjoyed reading these books because they are fun and that if you want to know all about quidditch and fantastic beasts, so let's say ther are the best source of informations (because granted by the very author's imagination)what you have to be aknowledged is that the founds raised by the purchases of both books are given to a charity, so buying them has to be a good thing to do.NB: excuse my english but i'm french and it was not very easy to write this review."
4,JK Rowling has such a great imagination,After the first book I was hooked and just can't get enough of the Harry Potter serious. Everyone should read these books. They take you to a magical place where the imagination can roam. These companion books are ok and interesting.
2,at least it helped a charity,"Needing a potter fix, I ordered these books. Nothing much new revealed here, be comforted that at least your money went towards one of JK's favorite charities"
4,Non- Related but still interesting.,"This book is one of Harry's school books. I think that this book isnt interesting like the actual Harry Potter books. To tell the truth, Quidditch book is really really boring but might be Interesting to some Really obsessed Harry Potter fan who wants to know the history of Quidditch, etc. The Beast book is more interesting since it is the property of Harry's. There are scribbles of Harry and Ron. It is quite funny on the comments of them. So... my suggestion is, buy these books if you want to see the comments from various Harry Potter Book's character."
2,These books are boring with a capital B!,"Come on! These books are so boring, dull, uninteresting, I could go on for hours! It is only for true Harry Potter freaks who are crazy about anything relating to him. These books are full of all these boring facts about Quidditch or Beasts, depending on the book you are reading. None of them are interesting, you can tell that they are made up completely, because none of this was mentioned in the real Harry Potter books, which are WAY more satisfactory than this rubbish. J.K. Rowling should not have made these books' profits go to charity, because no profits will be made. However, I think the idea of doing books for charity is nice, and that's the exact reason I gave this 2 stars, because it doesn't deserve half a point. I suggest you avoid this junk, because you will regret wasting your time reading it."
3,Harry potter Schoolbooks box set,"Pretty good reference IF you've read the books and is a die-hard Harry Potter fan. If not, then you are wasting your time, however, they are nice to have as part of your collection."
2,Not like to Harry Potter books....,"I am a HUGE fan of the Harry Potter books, so I was VERY excited when I heard that these books were coming out. I got them, but they were a complete dissapointment! For one thing, it was like reading a school text book, but the information you were reading was useless because you cannot use it in the real world. The only thing that I liked about the books is the little side notes the characters wrote inside Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and they are very creative. On the whole I would not recommend you get them."
1,"But the Type was too small, and I couldn't read it...!","....so I have no idea what it is about. To Publishers: How about, in the next printing, giving us a few more pages and raising the font size? Thanks! A Grandma (and not the only one, I'll bet!)"
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! YOUR KIDS WON'T READ THESE!,"I bought these for birthday parties, and a few of the Mom's told me (after alot of prodding from me) that the kids just looked inside, and threw the book aside. I decided to look at them. They are only for die-hard Harry Potter older fanatics. These books have no story line, and are ""boring."" The kids (I bought six sets of these things) all thought they were ""not as good as the books."" Save your money, and wait for her new book. .... Not too much thought or talent went into any of these books."
5,Harry Potter Schoolbooks' Review,"Delightful! If you are a fan of the Harry Potter series, then these books are a must have!"
4,Great Addition for Harry Potter Fans,Very useful for finding out about Hermione's cat Crookshanks!!!
5,Harry Potter's School Books,"I bought these books for someone who is a huge Harry Potter fan. These books actually look like they belonged at Hogwarts School. They are fun books, full of facts to embellish the magical world Harry lives in. The book about Quiddich gives history to a sport that is famous for wizards and witches. The Magical Beasts book has loads of facts about many animals. These books are a fun addition to the collection of any Harry Potter fan."
4,Harry Potter Fantastic Beasts,I recieved my product early but I did order from the same state. I really liked the reviews of how well the item was put out. My son is the one who has the books and he really loves them. They were in really good condition when we got them. Thank You
4,Happy little addition,"Fun type books that helps the reader understand a little more about the Harry Potter world, and some funny notes as well!"
4,"Clever, not quite right though","J.K. Rowling clearly took some background material she had developed for the series and put it into these ""books."" They certainly don't appear to be ""textbooks"" and so there is some loss of verismilitude (like you can believe in wizards :-) however at less than $5 for the pair they are probably required for any serious reader's collection. I am continually impressed by the way in which the stories, and these titles, weave together a story arc that is both engrossing of the moment, and also leaves us wondering/hoping for more. (Too bad she can't write the X-files for Chris Carter, but that is another rant.)If you didn't either pre-order the last two books before they came available or buy them on the day of their release, then these schoolbooks won't be for you. If, on the other hand, you can't get enough of Hogwarts and the whole Harry Potter universe and have the christmas ornaments and the Hogwarts Journal, and etc, then you have to get these books."
4,Good fun,"These books are good, ligh-hearted fun. The Magical Beasts book is the jewel of the set. With comments from Harry, Ron and Hermione written in the margins, the descriptions of the magical creatures in Harry Potter's world take on great humor."
3,For Potterheads!,"Well, I was very excited to start reading the Potter books and absolutely love all of them, which is why I wanted to get my hands on anything Jo wrote (still do). However, as fantastic as it is to actually HAVE ""Harry's books"" they were not a big reading per se. I mean, for us Potterheads they're great and just love how little scribblings and jokes are around the edges of the book, these really fit into the fantazy they were really his at some point, which is hilarious. But there's the rub, if you're not a really big Potterhead there's not a lot TO read. Not a lot of contents.So, there are two reasons for buying this one: one I explained (Potty headness); and the other is that Jo Rowling donated this cash to charity, which is always a great way to help."
5,Must have for any HP fan!,"If you consider yourself a fan of Harry Potter, you must get these two books! As it was JK Rowling herself who wrote these, they include a much needed background into the various beings and characters that exist in her books. Not only that, but all the proceeds go to charity, so buy these two now!!!"
3,Only if you're a Potter's Die-heart fan!,"These school-books are nice, funny, but not really worth buying. Only if you're a Harry Potter Die-heart Fan, or a generous person who's willing to donate your money."
4,A Quick Fix of Potter,"If you're looking for a quick fix of Harry Potter before the fifth installment arrives, look no further then these two school books. While the are quick reads, they are fun and informative of Quidditch and the magical creatures in the Harry Potter universe. They are worth checking out."
4,Wow,"These were great books and had everything I wanted in them. However, they were very short. I thought ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" was the best book. It had notes from Ron and Hermione and Harry. I loved the A-Z glossory of animals with ratings. I did also like ""Quiddich Through the Ages"", but that was an information book and had very little fun in it. It gave a few jokes but it wasn't very thourogh. These are nifty littly books that will hold you over till the next Harry Potter. Anouther little tip:on the back of both books you will find how much it costs in Wizard world. Get The Books! Its a good Buy!"
5,She's done it again...,"I, like most of the world, am awaiting the release of the fifth episode in the Harry Potter series. Quidditch Through the Ages and Fantastical Beasts and Were to Find them hascontented me until then.Quidditch through the ages gives a very in depth back ground to the sport, and there are even exerpts from ""historic"" letters and Daily Prophet articles. The evolution of the Golden Snitch was very interesting.I especially enjoyed Fantastical Beasts. The notes left in the margins by Harry and Ron, add a touch of personality. I found the history of the beast versus being great!As a writer, I find the time, effort and imagination that J.K.Rowling has put into these books staggering. MAybe some day she will find the time to write Hogwarts a History. It's no wonder that she has put her foot down and said that she needs more time for the fifth book.I commend her and encourage others to puchase these books. Besides, it's for a great cause."
5,Total fun for HP fans!,"These books can be read quickly and are highly entertaining for both longtime fans and HP novices. The ""notes"" that Harry and his friends have ""written in"" are hilarious and endearing. Recommended!"
4,One is better than the other,"While the Amazing Beasts book is cute and informative it is not as interesting as Quidditch Through the Ages. The book on beasts reads like a series of disconnected encyclopedia entries that add to the understanding of the interactions that Harry and company have with them in the novel, but it lacks any real narrative structure. In my book Beasts gets a 3, but Quidditch definitely gets a 5!!"
2,Doesn't work well,It's better to save the money for a real wide angle. At least with my Canon 18-55mm it doesn't work well.
3,Papo Triceratops,"I was a bit disappointed in the size, I expected it to be bigger. However, it is a very heavy dinosaur for its size. Good detail."
4,Great details,"I gave this to my 6yr old for his birthday, he LOVES it. It is solid and has great detail."
3,Papo Triceratops,"I sent mine back after i received it because it was way less detailed up close and was REALLY REALLY SMALL. I own the spinosaurus, t-rex and velociraptor which are also small but very detailed. For younger kids im sure they wouldn't mind but I got mine to be a display"
3,many very sharp edges!,"The toy is very lifelike, which is why I purchased it, but there are a lot of really sharp points/edges on the toy so I am afraid to give it to my nephew. It says for ages 3 or over, but I'm not sure it's appropriate for a kid under 7 or 8 considering. Especially if there is a younger sibling in the house."
4,Papo Triceratops...,"The detail on this Triceratops is fantastic. It feel solid, and the coloring is subtle, not garish like some of the others I have seen.My only gripe is the pose. It just stands there. It's not in a defensive position, or about to charge. It just looks like it's grazing, which is nice, I suppose if you want a cow instead of a dinosaur model.For this reason, I have to give it only 4 out of 5 stars. It is still the best trike model on the market, so it is still solidly recommended. The pose is just so uninspired, but the sculpt is divine, none-the-less."
2,Detail in sculpt but.....,"Looks nothing like the image Amazon shows. I have a few of the Papo dinosaur figurines 2 T-rex( different poses )theAllosaurus,Styracosaurus,Velociraptor and Pteranodon they all are remarkable in sculpt and paint detail, the Triceratops is not in the same league. The one I received was a muddy green with glue smeared all around the neck where head was attached, not the quality I was expecting from Papo. I realize the price wasn't the same as T-rex models but no excuse for shabby quality control."
3,Evil Forces by the band E-Force,"""E-Force"" is Eric Forrest's Voivod name. Everyone had a rock 'n' roll moniker in that band, though Forrest's wasn't used often at all while he was a member. Voivod fans will be pleased up to an extent with this record if they are fans of the era of the band which is defined by his tenure. Actually, if there were another member this record wouldn't work to the extent that it does, mostly because of the vocals. Forrest is an excellent singer for this kind of music, moreso in Voivod than E-Force because in the former he employed more of his range. But E-Force kind of sounds like Bolt Thrower as well because of the twin guitar rhythm work and the overabundance of double bass drums. The record is kind of chaotic and almost sounds sloppy although it isn't - it's just because it sounds like it's barely contained. Bottom line, this record is a good listen but won't blow you away. I'm not dissapointed that I purchased this album."
3,basic economics with a bahamian accent,"a well written easy flowing book by a former economics minister.everything about CAFTA,GATT,WHO ,Afta as it pertains to the Bahamian economy but also to one who wants to understand what all these terms mean.i picked it up in Nassau and spent more time with it on the beach !!"
2,My daughter loved it.,"My daughter rented this movie and watched it for 3 days straight. Then was willing too use her own money to buy one. I how ever had to watch it once and that was too much for me, but I'm not 8 years old."
2,This is NOT a true children's movie,"I happened past this movie one night on television and I must say, for a children's movie this was NOT a good idea!!! I truly stress the PG rating on this movie. There is bad language and inappropriate subject matter throughout this film. Parents be cautioned, children should not watch this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Ice Cream Ball,This is a great little product with some very nice ice cream recipes included in with low fat options.It requires a LOT of ice and does get heavy but with heavy cream our ice cream was ready in 20 minutes. Really very nifty and am very happy with it.
2,Buy an electric icecream maker instead!,"It takes several hours for the icecream to freeze inside the ball, and bearing to shake it that long is inpossible. If you want to make icecream, I suggest you buy an electric icecream maker instead!"
4,synopsis,"Communities and citizens across America are concerned and distressed about the increase in gun-related violence -- especially violence involving kids, both as victims and perpetrators. Filmed in the summer of 1998, in the streets of Miami's tough Liberty City section, this documentary tells the story of three innocent young people who were victims of shootings and explores the resulting grief and crisis experienced by the community. A co-production of Court TV and the Miami-based Television News Group, the program was written, directed, and produced by Rob Feldman. ~ Alice Duncan, All Movie Guide"
5,good book,"this book has very good explanations of the various ways to utilize the I Ching, and well translated from the original text"
5,Wonderfully accurate!,"This book is amazing. I recommend it as a beginner's I Ching. But as you learn from the book and grow you will find that its the only I Ching book you will ever need. The simple explanations are very profound, when you are ready to discover the profound."
2,Read the book before you write a review!,"I don't believe that all of these people giving such rave reviews of this book have really used it for long. I also would tend to rate it very highly, except that there is a glaring typo, like the entire description, of hexagram #15. I used to have a copy of this book, and used it, and for the most part loved it, but I find it difficult to believe that an author of any integrity would not have done a revision by now, and corrected the error. If that was done, I would happily buy and use another copy of this book"
1,Bad Experience,"this product damaged after 15mins of operation, the bulbs burnt, u get what u pay for"
3,strobe lights,it looked a little larger on the internet so i was a bit surprised how small it actually was.
3,Not so good,"bought these to add some flash to my car. they were easy to install and worked well for a while, then they dies like 2 weeks after they were installed and i didnt even use them everyday. my advice is if you are a serious car fanatic and looking for somethign lasting spend a bit more and buy somethign more reliable. if you are looking for somethign cheap and fast and dont mind replacing them ever so often (cause you will need to especially since they are not water proof) then this is a good quick fix."
2,very cheap,"cheappppppp. not bright and soder broke off the bulb, not worth it. unless you are very careful and put them somewhere good."
4,fun accessory,"the construction is so so.the wires are very thin and the relay box heats up very quickly,although nothing has gone wrong with the kit sp far."
1,Pilot WI200 Adjustable Plug-In Strobe Lights,"Worst product purchased from amazon to this day.I read the reviews and thought they might be a little harsh, but the outcome is what some posted.First the strobes did not come with instructions, second it did not work using a fused line.. which made no sense... Then after hooking them up all the power was going to only one side,,, the other side flickering once in a while...Total garbage..And yes I know what I am doing when hooking up vehicle wiring.I am going back to the truck stop where I purchased real strobes lights, they cost a pretty penny, 60. for each strobe but well worth the price.Good thing this garbage only cost 6. bucks,, I guess you get what you pay for."
2,really cheap,you get what you pay for they worked when i tested them but had crappy thin wire one broke off the bulb i can fix it but these strobe light will NOT hold up long in any thing i have them as warning light on my tractor but i bet the will be junk in 3 months great for a cheap thrill but not very durable
1,Worked for about 10 seconds,"Don't waste your money on these. They worked for about 10 seconds before they quit. Not only are these a waste of money, but also a waste of time to install. I wish Amazon allowed ratings of no stars."
4,Great game,"The game is great for the amount of money I spent on it. I wish it had the different hosts on it and that there were more options when customizing your family. Overall, it is fun,difficult, and entertaining. If you like game shows, this game is right up your alley."
4,Family Feud,We enjoy this game. We really interact as a family. Now we need to get another controller.
1,Do not buy!,"If you like Family Feud, do not ruin any good memories you have of the game show by playing this game. I have only played this about 4 times so far, but I am already fed up with it. Here's my list of what I hate about it so far:Nit-picking answers. I answered ""bike"" for a way to get to school, but it X'd me and the answer ended up being ""bicycle.""Ridiculously hard computer opponents on the ""average"" setting. I'm not dumb, but I felt that way after losing three times in a row.Fast money round does not give enough time to type in the answers. This is very frustrating. It wouldn't be a problem if I had a keyboard attached to my PS2, but I don't.Overall slow gameplay (except for not having enough time to answer the questions).Completely bogus surveys - even Americans wouldn't answer surveys this idiotically.Conclusion: Absolutely no fun. Completely frustrating."
2,too slow,gameplay is too slow especially if you have other people playing with you..and some of the answers seem to just be rediculous
2,Not what I expected,This game is not as fun as it might seem like. It's pretty cheesy actually. The animations repeat themselves too often and the game play is just not that great.
4,Classic Game,"Everything you would expect from Family Feud is in this game. You even have opportunites to ""unlock"" other stages, meaning: the game has changed over the years... the stage itself and the host. You can go back to the 1970 stage and host... kinda cool...One bad thing is that if you don't spell out the answer correctly you will get it wrong. I kind of expected that though, thats how these games usually work."
3,Not very durable,"This bag looks awfully cool, but over several months of light use it has developed a small hole in the front pocket. One of the metal buttons on this pocket pulled out of the fabric when I tried to pull it open."
3,approach it with an open mind,"When this book first appeared in bookstores there was complete silence in the media. When I read it on the bus I got so many dissaproving looks that I had to remove the dustcover. This is an important memoir that tells a previously hidden part of the history of the Civil Rights movement. As for MLK's sex life the details mentioned in this well written book have already been hinted at in Ralph Abernathy's memoir years ago.As for GDP herself, I have commend her for not trying to sugar coat the story. She comes off as a willful, selfish woman and doesn't seem to mind it as long as the true story is told."
2,Disappointed......,I was not sure what to expect from this book but I purchased with an open mind after examining all of the reviews. I found myself disappointed. I would not recommend buying this product unless you find it at a yard sale or in the bargain bin at your local bookstore.
3,Mostly pleased,"I only use the cassette portion which work well and suits my needs. The radio part though has pre-programmed stations (3 I think) and they either do not come in or it's not anything I want to listen to. I have not tried to listen to the tv or weather part. If you just want to use the cassette part, get it. If you want to use the radio part then I wouldn't get it."
1,Seller Error,Seller sent incorrect item. I returned it at MY EXPENSE. Seller refunded my original credit card charge because they said they did not have the item I ordered. HOWEVER I checked Amazon site for this item and this seller and it is still listed as available. Sony Walkman WM-FX290.
3,Tape Player,"I found that the sound on the tape player, was not good at all. At first I thought it was my tapes, because I had not play them in a while. Then I used another walkman and discover there was nothing wrong with my cassette tapes. It with this walkman that was sounding kind of muffled. Having said that the radio, I fine good and the sound was good, coming from the radio. I still love my tapes, and I hope, they don't do away with them completely.BSmith0201"
2,Not happy,"Ordered and recieved in good condition and timely, however was not the product advertised. Costly due to the fact it was a cheaper model and ultimely costed me over 60.00 more than I had to spend. I did call before purchase and was told it was what I wanted....but not."
2,not as advertised,"The product was advertised as ""Sony WM-FX290 Stereo Cassette Player with FM/AM/TV/Weather Tuning"" but the models (I ordered 2) sent to me were WM-FX290W which does NOT have the TV feature. I am very disappointed as that was one of the main reasons I ordered this model."
5,My third one!,"I use this 365 days a year and probably at least 4-6 hours each day. It is used while walking the dog, working out, doing dishes and laundry, and especially while working in the garden. It takes a ton of abuse and keeps on working. I love being able to listen to the 3 major TV stations and PBS yet not be glued to the TV screen."
1,wrong product,i did not ever get the product i ordered. so i would have to rate its very low. also the company which i ordered from never got back to me on any of the questions i had. i emailed them about 10 times and no response. i will NEVER buy from them again.
2,Sony WM-FX290,"Though it is, as it was described, unfortunately, it turned out that the radio receiver is extremely weak and consequently not useful to me. The cassette player is acceptable. I would not recemmend."
1,No review - withdrawn,"No review, I hereby request my previous review be withdrawn at once. No review, I hereby request my previous review be withdrawn at once."
2,Sony Walkman,I can't hear the sound on this Sony at all at Staples Center. I have a very old larger Sony Walkman that I have been using at the Lakers games to listen to the radio broadcast of the game while I'm watching and it works great. I was looking for a replacement in a smaller size. This was not a good purchase. It works okay at home.
3,The Inexpensive Fragile One,"There is nothing like an inexpensive, good-time.And that is what this Cassette Player with FM/AM/TV/Weather Tuning gives.But careful with that apparatus.One drop to the floor or ground and it's functionality could be gone.But you are much more sensitive than I. much more careful too.Clutsy me! The last model of this make which I had, I dropped and POP went the door to the battery compartment: broken.So let this review sit like a pancake on your plate: use with care least you get fat hubris and drop your model like I dropped mine.The Sony WM-FX290 is an inexpensive buy but sensitive if you are mean.Another way of saying this is, is: The unit is economical, but if you drop it, it won't ""cheep."""
3,One of Sony's lower-tier walkmans,"I have noticed that Sony had two tiers of walkman when they were still producing them; a high-end one (including, for example, the Sony WM FS566) and a low-end one (including, for example, the Sony EX190). If you have had good experience with their lower-tier, you could buy this, but as of 04/11/09 Frys has it for 29.99 and Jandr for 34.95 (NOT refurbs). I would strongly advise against paying 90$+ for this machine because it is the lower tier and doesn't sound great and you can find it for under half the price anywhere else. The national blue- and- yellow place has this product for 39.99 -- and none of these are refurbs or anything.EDIT: Sony has it for $29.99 as of 04/12/09"
3,I'm blown away by the price difference on BB,Just got this for my grandmother. Was blown away that it could cost this much and went to check prices elsewhere. Found that you can get it for about 1/2 this price. Yikes.
5,"Good sound, good value","Very nice sound, and the one battery is nice too. I purchased this to replace some cheap players that kept breaking down, and I am quite pleased with the new one. I listen to a lot of audio books, and this works well."
1,Be warned! this is not the Walkman with the TV sound,"I bought this Walkman because I wanted to hear TV sound, and as I only recently found out, because of the new switch to digital TV, you can no longer hear the TV sound via portable devices. So, beware if you buy it for that."
5,Nice for the price,"I bought this for my husband who just wanted something to listen to his cassette tapes. But, it has AM, FM, TV, and a weather band! The batteries last a long time too. The price is less than some of the others that only have AM, FM, and cassette. I would highly recommend this one."
1,Save your money - this is a piece of junk -,"I have bought 4 of the walkamn wm-fx290 - 3 new and 1 refurbushed - the latch on 3 of them have broke and require a large rubber band to hold the latch closed. The latch has a very very poor design and a very small part of the plastic latch will break off. The recorders were used for listening to library tape cassettes. Currently, one player will not work - two players have tape wow, flutters and drag. One player with rubber band is currently working. Sony missed the boat on this pig! The person or persons responsible for this product should be flogged!"
3,Good tuner and tape ....usual lack of volume.,"Very good reception for FM not bad for AM/MW.Decent tape deck without a lot of wow and flutter,allthough cue/review would have been nice.Not Cro2 compatable(no switch).It comes with a handy protective slip case.How can you get any volume out of one AA cell? You can't.Has the same pathetic lack of volume as most of the newer walkman types.Headphones that come with it are not the best...but when have you ever got a good set of 'phones with a walkman? Invest in some Koss Porta-pros.It's money well spent.all in all it's a good little unit..but as usuall for todays gear,don't expect much volume."
1,Used once and failed,"I purchased this as a 2005 Christmas gift for my 77-year-old mother who didn't open the packaging until May 2006 when she first wanted to use it while walking the neighborhood. She installed new batteries (purchased May 2006) and walked around her subdivision once. The next time she went for a walk the unit would not power up. More new batteries were installed. The unit will not work at all. I have installed new batteries that I bought and cannot get the unit to work at all. Being that she waited until warmer weather to use it as she intended, I was unable to return it. I went to Sony's website but unfortunately could not find any way to contact them. I had a difficult time finding one with cassette as well as weather band/Tv band, AM"
2,I Guess Sometimes You Win...and Then You Draw,"I was hoping this new set would recreate the awesome sound I had from my previous one (AIWA personal cassette/stereo) - It doesn't but the sound is 'bearable'. The sound is not so rich but it does the job on a couple of FM stations I listen to most. Mega Bass is 'just ok' but could be better. It's definitely not like my old AIWA - But, hey at least I have the Sony Headphones I bought and it helps listening to - I will keep it but I am a bit disappointed. Don't buy this if you want to pick up distant or weaker FM stations. Trust me, shop elsewhere for a AIWA or another unit that has 'solid' DX tuner capabilities or look at ebay for a AIWA like my oldie that I lost in Hawaii (Shame on ME!!!) Peace Joe G 'Bear'"
1,Weird Keyboard,"Thought I might like the new style keyboard, but I didnt at all. In fact I couldnt even type on it! The range sucks and the wireless is a plug / cord combo..This item sucks.. Not sure how these other people are happy with this product.If you like that style keyboard and you need the wireless for more than a few feet than this keyboard is for you!Robert"
2,Not a reliable means for data entry,"This means for moving the input on the keyboard to the mother board, is inconsistent, unreliable and a pain to work with. Basically this product is sitting to one side since I cannot return it. My other experience with Logitec, has been positive so the experience with this combination was a distinct letdown."
5,Real Comfort,"I purchased this to replace an older model that had finally died. This model has great feel, as the wrist pad and the sides of the mouse have rubber surfaces that feel soft to the touch. In addition to the feel, the sensor has a very modern look.Out of the box, the mouse and keyboard connected easily and quickly. Both work great with rechargeable batteries, so you can save some money there. Neither have used up the initial batteries put in them, so I can only say that battery life is very good.I will say that I was using a standard keyboard while waiting for this one, and it was so nice to get the comfort split keyboard layout back. Once you get used to it, you'll never want to go back to a standard layout.The appearance of the sensor is really nice, the mouse if really functionally, and the keyboard has enough programmable keys to make must users happy. Overall, a great desktop"
5,Perfect product,"This is a perfect product in every way.It's only short coming is that the transmittermust be no more than 3 feet from the keyboardor mouse. But again, it is awesome otherwise.Phil in Atlanta"
3,Not bad but the older Logitech Ergos were better...,"I had purchased this to replace the older version (Cordless Desktop Pro) of Ergo board from Logitech that I ABSOLUTELY LOVED but my wife had spilled water on and killed. I don't know why they changed the key feel but like some others have said it IS a bit stiff. I had an older M$ Natural (v1 of the 4000 w/o the scroll wheel in the split) and it just died now I am at a crossroads. I tried the Logitech wave but I am used to the key placement and comfort of a split keyboard and it's just not the same. The key touch of the Comfort Laser is responsive and accurate but the keys themselves are ""stiff"" so if you prefer a softer touch keyboard then you may consider something else. Otherwise it IS a good keyboard. I have never tried the mouse so I cannot praise or criticize that part of the product."
5,Great product!,"I've had it a few weeks now & haven't had any problems.I did notice that in certain spots, the spacebar is noisy, but mostly only because the other reviewers thought it was a problem. In my general use, I don't realize it at all!"
2,Get something else,"I bought this keyboard because of the split design (better wrist angle), but the keys feel loose and a bit sluggish. They also have a surprising amount of resistance so that my hands get tired after a very short time and the space bar tends to stick in the ""on"" (down) position. The keys are also kind of large so I find myself reaching for the backspace key. For $80, I expected better quality and ergonomics from Logitech. I really feel like, with more work, they could have a fantastic product. If they added a touchpad to the keyboard, it would be even better."
1,Died after 4 months,It worked great for about four months. Then it started missing keystrokes. Then more keystrokes. Then the mouse died. Replacing batteries and rebooting had no effect. Now I have fodder for the landfill and my wallet is much lighter. BUYER BEWARE.
3,I expected cream of the crop,"I'm a bit disappointed with the unit. I've used it for about 1 month. The comfort is very good but there are a few annoying points. I expected a quite keyboard. The space-bar as previously written about, has a nasty click and the other keys also click. As written, the home, end, insert and delete keys are in non standard positions. I thought I could get used to these annoyances but will probably purchase a different unit."
4,Great overally but the space button is weird,"I haven't been using this keyboard for long yet, but the first thing you will notice is a completely different step of the space key comparing to other keys. Other keys have normal, a little soft ""click"". But when you press space key, it doesn't do any ""click"" and you are not sure if the key has been pressed at all. It is like are tapping a piece of gelatin. However, the movement to press space properly is not big, so it is rather not a problem with missing space chars or something like that. I believe this was done for a good reason and maybe I need to just get used to it, and then I will see the advantage over space keys in normal keyboards.Also great is that you can connect the keyboard either through ps2 or normal USB. When connected through USB both the mouse and the keyboard are visible in the system. When connected through PS2 only keyboard/mouse is visible, depending on which cable has been plugged in."
3,Beware of different styles,"The image on this page shows Elmo on the package. The package I received contained Dora the Explorer diapers. I have since found other boy/girl specific listings of the same size Pampers swim diapers. So if it matters to you, look for one of those other listings."
4,"Finally, Al all the time anytime","I love Mr. Franken's books, and I love this CD. Although where I live we don't have an Air America station, once in while I do stream it on the internet. However, when I saw that this was out I immediately knew I wanted to purchase this CD. I give it 4/5 stars because I really like most of it, but there are some skits that are just okay, and not as outstanding as the rest of them. My favorites include: Ann Coulter in the Green Room (Part 1, 2, and 3), The Oy Yoy Yoy Show, President Bush Drops By, and Wally Ballou at the Airport.I definitely recommend picking up this CD for some sanity in the world of right wing radio."
5,I Want To Hear The Rest Of The Show,This collection of bits was fantastic. I hope more CD's from the show are released. Democrat and Republicans alike will get a kick out of this.
2,Doesn't Translate,"I love Al Franken, but these radio show bits cobbled together doesn't make for very good entertainment."
5,Fantastic Salt Substitute!,"I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewers - this product is great! Very flavorful. We are learning how to use various herbs and spices so this was a real find. This product is mentioned in Jordan Rubin's books and that is what prompted us to look for it. After getting weird looks from most health food store clerks, I finally went online and was very pleased to find it available here. I would highly recommend this product for anyone interested in finding something other than salt to flavor their foods. In fact, I am going to order more!"
5,great seasoning!,"This is a great seasoning to use on just about anything. It can be difficult to find in some areas, so it is nice to know you can get it from Amazon."
5,Best stuff ever.,One 8.8 oz. jar had lasted me a couple years. Then I ran out and was not heading back to Europe anytime soon to get more. And here it was! This is the best salt/herb salt in the world. So happy.
2,Not what it appears to be in photo,"The cabinet part of this item met my expectations. However, the mirror (the main reason I purchased it) is quite different from the photo. The photo shows a mirror with a beveled edge around its circumference. This is false. There is no beveled edge. There is only a cheap looking steel frame. The kind with a seam at the corners. Functionally, it works as hoped. But it looks like you know what."
4,Nice Voice Very well temed by Lynne Arriale trio,Very good trio the Lynne Arriale trio and the voice of Jerry Grillo a good surprise. Nice music to ear in a bar by the night. Nice music to warm ambiente
2,Went off Track,"The book was a big dissappointment. The concept and the writing style were promising but missed the boat two ways. First, the technique of narrating the seventh series' game and cutting away to previous years was a bit confusing. But what ruined the book was the author's need to insert his politics into a book of this sort. They were unnecessary and irrelevant."
4,good baseball memoir,"A very moving and well-written memoir of baseball and family. I'm too young to remember the Brooklyn Dodgers and the 1950s, but Oliphant brings that era back to life with his vivid recollections. Some baseball fans will, and have, argued that the author focuses too much on his own family in this book. But it's a memoir and not a strict baseball history lesson, so I think he's more than justified in writing about his beloved parents the way he does. And the fact that he played piano for Billie Holiday scores him bonus points in my opinion!"
4,rewarding,"I found this book an excellent way to revisit a time of my youth...I think that the writer Thomas Oliphantis a very spiritual man, he writes from his heart. As I read his account of the 7th game of the '55 WorldSeries I was able to visualize every pitch....Highly recommend this book.Frank M."
1,You will enjoy this book if you like reading crap!,"The author includes numerous inaccuracies and errors.However, the real problem with the book is Mr. Oliphant's writing style. His strained, over-the-top writing style wears on the reader after 20 pages. Don't waste your time on this book."
3,"Not terrible, but thankfully not too long, either","This is simply my opinion, but I often had difficulty following exactly which game and/or inning the author was referring to. When I could follow things, it was fairly interesting, though I got tired of being reminded how liberal a family the author came from. Considering I've recently read The Boys of Summer (Roger Kahn)and I Never Had it Made (Jackie Robinson), I had some interest in the subject matter, but I found the baseball reading considerably diluted by the author's reminiscence on his own childhood. (Yes, I know it was also a memoir of his youth.) Overall, not a bad read, but certainly not the best either."
3,More Baseball Less Oliphant,This is a good review of the Brooklyn Dodgers and their classic World Series victory over the Yankees in 1955. As a 12 year old at the time I can empathize with Oliphant's recollection of the times and what life in Brooklyn was all about. But I was less interested in Oliphant's personal biography because he didn't live in Brooklyn and his whole childhood seemed to be framed by friends of his family who provided opportunities for him that the rest of us never had. He kind of comes off as a twerp which is solidifed by his picture in the Brooklyn Dodger uniform. But kudos for good research and an understanding of baseball.
4,Good on its own terms,"The problem with the memior as a form is that you are judging the person, more often than not, rather than the actualy content of the book. So, that being said, this book works as any book on a good memory does, when the author is talking about baseball.But the non-sense about the author's mind for social justice seems to be a little of the mark.Great for all baseball fans."
3,I Wanted to Like it More,"Yes, this is another one of those growing up in Brooklyn with the 50's Dodgers books. Oliphant displays a love for his family, the Dodgers and Brooklyn. Actually, though I really enjoy baseball books, I found myself enjoying the Brooklyn stuff more. For instance, I didn't know that Brooklyn is ten times the size of Washington, DC. Oliphant was nothing if not thorough in covering the games of the '55 Series, to the point I began scanning after awhile. I wanted to enjoy it more. However, it is a good read."
2,Been Here Before,"I'm sure if you lived through these times and were a Dodger fan, you'll like this, however, there's really nothing new here. The Dodgers have attained an essentially mythic status and this is still another book which seeks to add to it. I also found the author's personal history repetitive and uninteresting. Someone else described him as a twerp, which is accurate."
1,"With A Prayer Like This, Who Needs Enemies?","I'll try not to waste much of your time - see H. Eisenberg's review of this book (""Oliphant is a phoney"", dated February 3, 2006). He states the case better than I ever could as to why this book should be avoided at all costs.Oliphant made me hate him and his family in this sob-story of growing up (in Manhattan, mind you, not Brooklyn) as an ""underprivileged"" child.The only way to get any entertainment out of this tripe is to count how many names of famous friends of the family he drops throughout the narrative (for an underprivileged family, the Oliphants apparently were amazingly well connected!!).This book is so bad, Oliphant even almost made me hate Brooklyn itself by the time I was through (I paid enough for it, I might as well read the whole thing). Sacrilege!!!Get Doris Kearns Goodwin's 'Wait 'Til Next Year' instead and leave 'Gil Hodges' in the minors."
1,STARSHIP SECTION MESSED UP,"Being that I am currently in the process of writing a book detailing the history of Federation starships, I was apalled when I noticed that most of the registry numbers and classes for the ships were WRONG. My friend and I picked up a copy of this book in our local bookstore and were flipping through it, and we were laughing out loud when we noticed the mistakes.If you're a ship enthusiast like myself, DO NOT buy this book because it will make you sick to your stomach. Off the top of my head I cannot remember what some of the exact mistakes are, but they claim that the U.S.S. Excelsior's registry number is NCC-53847. Right. And that the U.S.S. Enterprise is NCC-1631 or something like that. Hey, they got the 1's right in the begging and end! Please contact me if you have an opinion about this."
1,thumbs down,didn't even finish this one. just too smutty for me. no real story line. some may like it but i didn't.
5,Great D/s fiction,"After her husband death Gabrielle find's out that his best friend Michael has always wanted her. She leaves with Michael for his isolated home to begin her training in ""tough love"". During this time Michael's friend Raoul comes for a visit & is stunned by Gabrielle's submissive glory. He beins to act out masochistic deeds on her as well. Caught up in the pleasure/ pain of her new world Gabrielle must choose between her two masters. This is a wondeful story with an intresting use of electical devices & curious inventions!!"
4,Nicely organized introduction for brand new research area,"The writer has been consistently working on one subject, ontology, for a long time. And this book is a good introduction for those who are fed up with learning a new acronym and its one or two page tutorial, but are (or want to be) serious in ontology."
3,Big watch,"PROS:Looks cool, especially the compass feature which gives you a degree reading, and shows you cardinal points via LCD lines on the face of the watch.the backlight button is located centered below six O'clock on the bezel, which is easy to press.CONS:No stopwatch! I don't understand why not.The compass has an accuracy of +/- 11 degrees which is poor by compass standards, and shuts off after 20 seconds, so you would have to hit the button every twewty seconds to keep it constantly reading."
1,Disappointed,"I could not believe that a watch at this price does not have a stopwatch, nor timer, nor multiple daily alarms. Stay away from this watch and go to the PAG80T or the PAW1100T for almost the same price and you will get a full fetured watch. Why would they leave these basic items out of module 2471?"
2,The temperature precession needs a big fix,"I was so happy when I first got the watch, only to be disappointed later on.The temperature readings are now where close to the actual reading they are off by 20 F. I have not looked at altitude readings yet. I would not recommend this watch to anybody."
5,What you expect it to be and more,"If this is the watch you are looking for, it will deliver exactly what it advertised at a great amazon price!"
5,Cape Bretons Jewel !,"I attended the concert in Cape Breton and was captured by this strong yet gentle, crisp, clear well shaped sound that, like myself, had captured all present. That sound was the voice of 'Cape Breton Tenor' Peter Gillis. None other could wear the title than him. The music,arranged by Gillis himself, brought new life to the songs of our past. Gillis, like none other, makes exceptional use of his musical talent in dramatic tempo changes,close harmonies,drawing on sudden muscial phrasing making them strech to perfect point before returning to it's former. This is an absolute MUST have cd for any music lover. Gillis shows his perfection and attention to detail in his version of our past! Gillis , if nothing, has shown his musical genious to all. Dr.Gillis , Thank you for sharing your gift with us."
4,Practical and substantial,"Apart from one chapter (which was not written by Funk), this is an excellent book. It surveys a number of practical methods through which a Christian can draw on ancient practices to remain attentive to the presence of God."
4,Not their best.....,"but still essential for a python fan. With horses jumping over the cast of The Sound of Music, the ""Worst family in Britain"", Mr Neutron and Teddy Salad - the man disguised as a dog, how can you go wrong?I assume they will include episode 45 in this set, but knowing them - that'll be released with the german episodes."
4,Their least but still worthy,"These are the last six episodes of the series (episode 45 *will* be included in this set though it doesn't say so here. The first two episodes of this season (""The Golden Age of Ballooning"" and ""Michael Ellis"") are easily the weakest two episodes of the entire series, but the later episodes, including Mr.Neutron (one of my favorite Graham Chapman characters), are pretty good, and the final episode, featuring The Most Awful Family in Britain, ranks with the some of the best episodes from the first three seasons. Overall, this is for the completist, and casual fans should stick with the first three seasons. Also worth noting: these are the six episodes John Cleese does not appear in."
4,A must for Python Collectors,"The only reason that people might this particular season isn't as good as all the others is because John Cleese is gone. There is, however, in a special section of the DVD called the ""Loony Bin"" where you can see John Cleese do an especially funny bit. (I think this part was filmed for their 30th anniversary last year.)My favorite episode in this package is ""The Light Entertainment War,"" which contains such sketches as ""Woody and Tinny Words,"" and a delightful rendition of ""Anything Goes"" that Cole Porter obviously didn't write. I also loved the sketch with the stupid TV programmers, and Michael Palin's German Louis XVI.All in all, not as good as its predecessors, but I enjoyed it just the same."
4,Maybe I'm weird,"Maybe I'm weird, but I actually think ""Michael Ellis"" and ""The Golden Age of Ballooning"" are two of the funniest Python episodes of all -- and they're in this set. Everyone seems to sneer at the later episodes, but I think they're even more surreal than the earlier stuff."
2,Bracket size described wrong.,"Brackets have a mistake in description, they are only 3-1/2 inches long. These are way too small to hold my heavy wall mount sink."
4,Present,"This was a gift for my husband, a big Giant fan. Can't go wrong with this one. He can use this to keep others from his own personal space."
1,Big Pig,"I bought this big plush pig for my puppy who is 8 months old. After the 1st day she had it, the squeeker stopped. So much for a fun squeek toy."
5,Worth waiting for,"Finally what Kayama Yuzo fans like me have waited years for! Favorite songs from 2 of his most memorable albums. I just love this one! If the scale went to 10 this would easily rate a 20..great music, better memories...."
1,I received the wrong product.,"The company do not carry the item I purchased, so please take this off your list. Instead they send me something different that would not fit my AC."
3,Not the best...,"I agree with other reviews that find the music or the pace of this CD distracting. I enjoy much of the CD, especially the hip openers, but even experienced yoga practictioners might have trouble following some of the CD without something written - even a Sanskrit list of names - to describe the poses. I found ""Yoga with Ateeka"", with its excellent companion booklet, much more well-paced, and her voice and music more tranquil as well."
5,Great CD,"This is the best yoga CD I've heard. It's certainly not for beginners. However, level 2 yogis and especially those who are familiar with Vinyasa (similar to Ashtanga) will enjoy the pace and Kimberly's soft but powerful voice. The CD is excellent for practicing yoga at home because the tracks can be combined into four different practice lengths, depending on how much time you have (or energy). What's especially helpful are the bookend tracks: It begins with centering, which really helps to clear out all the clutter from the day, and then ends with a relaxation to let it all sink in as you fade into a calm shivasana. Finally, a light chime brings you back to the real world and you're ready to bring that peace into the rest of your day."
1,Performance art? Intentionally annoying?,This bizarre CD would be best categorized as performance art. Between Wilson's off-putting tone and the jarring experimental music the result is anything but tranquil. Maybe you want to find out whether you can practice yoga with these distractions. Otherwise your money is better spent on Shiva Rea's Yoga Sanctuary or any of Bryan Kest's CDs.
3,Not same quality as I purchased at Sears.,"Purchased to replace bag from Kenmore vacuum cleaner, but quality of bag is nowhere near what I purchased at Sears. Wish there was more description of item online."
2,Not as pictured,The bags I received were NOT the same as pictured (different packaging all together) and the number was not correct. I specifically needed #50690 which is what was pictured and described and the bags I received were #50688 and will not fit my vacuum. I hope the seller will correct this.
1,Unuser Friendly ...,Case looks nice and everything but be aware that this case will scratch your iPod when taken it and out . Monster Cable will not fit on the bottom connection and some after market headset as well so both have to be enlarge .
1,Scratcher.,I put my ipod in. Took it out the next day and it was already scratched severly on the screen. I had an older ipod that I never got a case for and used for 2 years. This got more scratched in this case in 1 day than carrying the other one in my pocket for 2 years.
5,Outstanding resource,This book very clearly presents important information to the reader about procedures needed in medicine. It has helped me immensely on rounds and on call.
4,Christmas Gift,"Because they no longer publish this in hardcover, Igave as gifts in softcover. Beautifully illustrated.Tells the meaning behind the song."
5,Best Baby Book,"When my children were babies, this book was my favorite. It gives you hints on what you need for every occasion. For example, my car was always stocked with everything I needed because the book told me what to keep in the car. When we went on an airplane, this book was my reference. I used it daily at first. When my second baby came along, the book went to the hospital with me to remind me of what I needed to do to get ready to take my child home. Unfortunately, it is now out of print. I have been searching for it so can I have it on hand to give to friends who are pregnant. My copy is so worn that it has rubber bands around it to hold it together. Buy it while you can!"
3,Great ideas,"I would have rated this a five but it has not been updated in years. I used it for my daughter, in fact my copy is held together with a rubber band because I used it so much. Lots of practical ideas and lists. I would take it out when traveling to be sure I didn't forget something and I added my own ideas to the lists. Stiill...worth buying for a new mom."
2,Kid Galaxy Excavator,This toy goes back and forth but is impossible to have any control over where it goes. The bucket arm is so loose that you can't keep it off the floor and it looks like you have to dismantle it to tighten it up.
3,Its fine for the price,"I wanted a lens that gave me a full range of focal lengths.The primary use is for taking pics of a high school band show during halftime a during competitions. I don't have the luxury of two cameras.It comes with a cap and a decent hood, but I also ordered a larger rubber hood with it as well. Auto focus works fine, but it seems to be a little slow to respond compared to a 70-300mm Quantaray lens that I was using. The focus and zoon rings seem to move in the opposite direction from every other lens that I have. That is slightly annoying.Other than that, it is a good lens for the price."
2,Don't buy This,"Lens describe small scratch but when i received it scratch was so deep on the front of the lens, and when you shoot on the bright area you can see the scratch from the lens."
5,A hidden bargain!,"I really like my copy of Sigma 28-200mm f/3.5-5.6 DG Macro. The image quality for the range of 50-200 is comparable to highly regarded Pentax DA 50-200. It is actually even better at 80-150, and 28mm is wide enough for most walk around activity.The Sigma 28-200 has faster/quieter AF than the DA-50-200, but it's little bit heavier and longer when fully extended. For the convinience of covering additional 28-50 and the IQ resulting as good/better than DA 50-200, I returned the DA 50-200.This product is one of the best deals out there for walk around lens. It's too bad this model has been discontinued and replaced by 18-200 DC model at alot higher price with lesser performance at long range, but you can still get Sigma 28-200 DG Macro while it's still available.happy shooting!"
4,photo bug,"I bought this lense for my new pentax digital. I do occassional wedding photography, and it's very convenient to use. Now I don't have to keep changing lenses for different shots. (as I used to do with my 35mm pentax).Can't beat the price for a lense this versatile."
3,Returned for another lens,"No big problem with this lens, but it felt a bit ""bargin basement"" when zooming, clunky perhaps is a better word. Anyway, I returned it for a full refund. 47St. Photo was no problem with the return, but I did get better service on the phone rather than email. I would deal with them again. Alas, they did not have the lens I really wanted, a Tamron 18-200 so I purchased it from 17St. Photo. Again, no problem."
5,Impressive,"I've done my research and to me this was the best deal. When comparing this lens to my old 100 mm from my Pentax K1000 i discovered there wasn't a significant difference at all. Maybe a very small amount of a difference but shouldn't a 100 mm be a little less then 200?? I'm not so sure i trust the rating. Other then that i honestly don't care, its a very pretty lens and i included a couple pics of the lens and one i took using the lens with my Pentax K10D."
3,Taking it into consideration,Ill keep it short and sweet. You pretty much need to take the entire books contents into consideration... the book breathes a lot of creativity into the subject... especially since from my knowledge of police work I know that you dont want to hide them in incredibly obvious hiding places everyone would pick. If you are going to read this book its a good idea to add your own creativity and not limit yourself to just these places. also a note on the combinations you have to be patient and trial and error sometimes is the only way to figure things out but usually patience is rewarded not only was the previous review not helpful it was harmful....
1,Geocacher's review,"I bought the book because I expected it to have been written by a former spy. I expected it would give me ideas for hiding geocaches [see geocaching.com].The author seems to be a dealer who hides money or unnamed substances, usually for someone else to pick up.Any geocacher who has played for anytime at all has seen many more creative hiding ideas than are offered here.I found it a waste of my time."
5,Toyota Headlights,Excellent product no complaints just a bit tricky for my son to install. Would highly recommend them the price is great.
5,"""A gripping read...""","""Exiled in the Dominican Republic after the Spanish Civil war, the Basque nationalist politician Jesús de Galíndez collaborated with the Dominican government. Later he moved to New York as representative of the Basque government in exile and perhaps as a CIA informant. At Columbia University he starts to work on a book about the inner workings of the Trujillo dictatorship. The secret police of the Dominican dictator kidnapped Galíndez in Manhattan in 1956 and transferred him to the island, where he was tortured and killed. An American woman investigates his disappearance in the 1980's."" This is as reviewed in ""The New Essential Guide to Spanish Reading"" which is published by America Reads Spanish: a campaign aimed to increase the use and reading of the Spanish language through the thousands of libraries, schools and book stores in the US."
5,Welcome to Life,"I can't even say the title of this album without singing the title track in my head! This is a super great follow-up album to ""The End and the Beginning""."
3,Disappointed,"I was hoping that this would be as ground breaking as the first one, but alas it did not..."
3,For Collectable only,"Although this is an older movie, I consider it a classic. Many people prefer the HM over the HM2000, yet, I think the HM2000 had more of a story line. I've seen them before, I just wanted them for my collection. It's basically okay animated movies, yet, if you've never seen them, don't expect the high tech graphics on this one."
5,"36"" SCUBA Regulator Hose",This isn't the same as my Reg hose that has an Oceanic Swivel on it but it was only meant to be a spare for my save a dive kit. It should work just fine if I need it. Looks very good quality as any OEM hose on either of my rigs.
4,+ 1/2 stars as well!,"I just wanted to add something to ""cdlover2277""'s well documented and informing review. I have the vinyl 45 single of ""Could It Be Magic"", which incorrectly states a run time of 3:37 on the record label, thus leading to some confusion. The single version actually runs 4:16 and is exactly what appears on the ""Essential Barry Manilow"" CD set. While some reviewers have expressed disappointment with the inclusion of the single version, it should be clarified that this is how the song was played on Top 40 radio back in 1975.Also, ""It's a Miracle"" does not appear in its correct single version form on this CD. The 45 runs shorter."
4,Forgot how good Barry was,"If you can forgive the corniness of the ""Copa,"" and his formula ascending-key-change climaxes, Barry Manilow offers some truly wonderful songs with believable lyrics and rarely-matched sheer musical beauty. I would have preferred that they didn't include live versions (BM Live! covers those well enough), but then again he's such a raw talent that there's not much divergence from studio quality. He loses authenticity in the 80's recordings, but hard core fans will be glad those were included."
2,Disappointed,"Don't like the sound of the CD. You have to keep turning the volume up or down, depends on which song he is singing. Not a very full sound."
5,Loved it!,"I just got it and even though I havent used it a lot, I really like it. Like the other person said, you really have to be close to the object, but it works great. For the money, it's a great product."
3,If it ain't broke ....,"If you have a Sony Cybershot H5, or any camera with a good zoom (not counting digital zoom) and a macro feature, you need this like you need a snowsuit in Guyana.The only difference this makes is that you get to look as if you know what you're doing as you attach the lens in a public place, and you get a black ring around the edge of the photograph of the object of your intention.It comes very nicely packaged in a black plastic case and a drawstring bag, but other than that, it's just for filling your accessory bag.Recommended for cameras without good zoom or macro features only.Amanda Richards, June 6, 2009"
4,pleased with the product,"I have 4 large dogs and they are older so I wanted them off of the floor.I ordered four of these over a year ago and my dogs must be satisfiedbecause they sleep in them all the time. I put a cushion in each bed fora softer surface. My dogs chewed every type of foam bed up whenever theyfelt they weren't getting enough attention, and I was always replacing them,which became quite costly. I would have given this product a 5 star exceptfor the fact that the screws do become loose over time and have to be tightenedup periodically with prolonged use. I'm counting on them lasting, but if theydon't I will invest in the cool-a-roo beds."
4,good dog bed,"This is a nice, sturdy dog bed. It was easy to put together and feels very durable. Our dog seems to like it, but still prefers to get on our bed. We are working to break this habit. Once we've done that, I think this dog bed will be great."
4,Dog bed,The large is much smaller than the one I owned previously (XL). Didn't realize it would be so noticlable.
5,Great for dogs,"I have to disagree with the current reviews on this dog bed. I bought this Durabed for my yellow lab all 96 lbs of him he loves it. never did the screws come lose he never chew on it. but he out grow that stage. the bed is strong. he sleeps in it most of the day and night. Maybe the company change some things because this bed is great. No tears in the frabic its very strong. cleans easly too. I also have a small child who love to play in this bed with the dog never had we had a problem.Those who have problems with this bed, If your dog is chewing on the frabic then its not the company fault its your dog. If you dont drag the bed across the floor then I cant see how the screws would break. I had the bed awhile now and still no problems. Again its a bed for dogs. treat it like you would your own bed and it will last a long time without problems"
1,"Petmate Durabed Elevated Pet Bed Extra-Large, Black","I really liked the bed, and the only problem that I had with it is that there are no replacement covers, you would have to buy a new bed if the cover gets damaged or stained."
1,Poor quality,A bolt sheered off after only a few days. Amazon gave me a hassle about returning. I eventually just threw it away. Spent WAY too much money for this piece of junk. Coolaroo is a much better product and MUCH cheaper.
3,Petmate durabed,"I purchased the petmate durabed for large breeds. I have a Doberman puppy that weighs 35 lbs and he absolutely loves his bed. A concern I have is that if he weighed the actual amount that the bed says it could hold, I don't believe the product would last very long. I have to tighten the legs every couple of weeks or the bed would collapse. The bed definitely shows the wear and tear from everyday use."
3,Durable Durabed?,"I have a problem chewer dog. I know the chewing issue is related to the dog and not specifically the bed. He is a large white German Shepherd who is too smart for his own good and bored sometimes. Read the reviews but purchased anyway. The bed assembled very easily and initially seemed like it would be very comfortable.The bad news was that within 24 hours the shepherd turned this bed into a literal pile of rubble! It was not salvageable at all. I cannot fault the bed as they do not claim it is chew resistant such as KurandaAll-Aluminum Elevated Chew-Proof Dog Bed Size: X-Large (27"" x 44""), Fabric: 40 oz. Vinyl - Royal Blue, which by the way I purchased elsewhere and is holding up very nicely.So if your dog has any chewing tendencies, use caution with these beds."
5,Dogs love it!,I had bought one of these for my dogs (Chihuahua and Min Pin) to share. Both like the bed but there were fights over it so I purchased a second one to keep the peace. I have a blanket over each to let them nest. Simple to put together.
1,"A great concept, but not very durable","I really liked this bed when I first got it last year. My dog liked the stiff bottom of the bed a lot better than her previous off-the-ground pet bed, which sagged and made it hard for her to get in and out of it. The poles and legs are wonderfully sturdy, but the weakness appears to be in the screws. After a few months of use, the screws to one leg of the bed sheered, leaving the bulk of the screw deep in the threads. I haven't been able to get it out yet to replace it."
1,Don't buy this bed,"I read the reviews. Unfortunately for me, I ignored the warnings. We had the bed ONE week when one of the bolts failed, rendering the bed useless and worthless. Trust me -- you do not want to buy this bed!"
1,It broke...,Only after one month the bed broke. My dogs were on the bed relaxing and it came crashing down. Luckily my dogs were fine and i got a refund.Don't buy this
2,"Dogs love it, owner sort of does...","I've been through 2 of these. The dogs (2 mini doxies) enjoy jumping into it. I like the fact that they're off the cold floors.However, the dogs just eat the material up. It may be just them but they've torn through the material on both units. In the first unit, one of the screws would not properly seat into the leg hole. It appeared the hole was not properly threaded. I managed to 'force' it in there and it was stable for a while. Over time, however, it gave way which lead me to try it one more time. This time all the screws were in solidly but once again they gave way over time. This time I'm looking for another option."
3,Spares problem,We have 3 of these beds but there is a problem when one of the extended head allen screws that hold the frame together snaps as replacements are difficult to find - so is getting hold of the manufacturer for spares.It is a good idea to remove the foam sheet that lines the baseboard as dogs love the chew it and then it clogs up the velcro fastenser - use a sheet of VetBed instead (no personal association)
3,Not good for Chewers,"We purchased 2 of these beds for our Beagles, who like to chew when unobserved. From the description, we hoped they wouldn't have much luck chewing through the material on this bed. They chewed up all the foam and even put several large holes in the cover itself. So much for getting a bed they can use outside and not worrying about them destroying it (and that was during a 4 hour time period). However, one bed has been left inside and it works well when you keep an eye on the dogs. If you have a dog that doesn't chew, I think this bed would be great. It is easy to put together and very easy to clean. Is a great bed for both outdoor & indoor dogs."
1,don't buy this from Amazon,"We ordered the first bed - it came without most of the frame and was missing the fastners. With amazon, you can't actually talk to some one on the phone, so we had to email, and finally got a replacement. The replacement was missing all the hardware but had the frame. Both beds had been opened and shipped back to amazon previously, as evidenced by the re-taping jobs on both boxes. Amazon obviously never opened the boxes to recheck them for parts, just mailed them out again to the next unsuspecting customer. Now we have two incomplete beds, we've been charged twice, and though the returns are supposed to be easy we've not been contacted by Amazon with return labels. I'm not paying to ship these 20# huge beds back. What a frustrating and expensive experience with Amazon."
1,Do not leave outside.,"We purchased this bed for our 75-lb Doberman and left it out on the deck, where he loves to lie in the sun. The deck is only semi-protected, and every time it rained, the bed would fill up with water - underneath the fabric is a piece of something non-permeable. We'd have to go out and lever the bed up to dump out the water. All of this, plus our toddler climbing in and out, and the dog jumping in and out of it, resulted in it completely falling apart in less than a year. The bolts are rusty and some have sheared off.The dog did like the bed, but despite the ""outdoor"" label this is not a bed to be left outside, unless maybe on a completely covered porch. A bed full of water is not particularly inviting. We were disappointed."
2,Traps water,"Our dog didn't find this bed to be comfortable, no amount of coaxing could get her to lay on it. But I don't blame that on the product, that's probably just her own quirk.However, one big flaw that I've discovered in this product is that after a rain, it traps water between the top and bottom layer of canvas. The water stays there indefinitely until you tip the bed to its side to let the water drain. If you let the water sit too long in the bed, then it builds up mildew (which you can see in the water as it drains out.The canvas started to bleach out from the sun after only a month or so outside, so I'm not sure how durable it will be.After 6 months, we got rid of the bed since it was clear that the dog had no desire to use it."
3,"Nice pen, but...","After a year and a half of steady use (but not abuse!), the pen works just dandy, but the black PAINT is coming off! First started flaking off around the gold band in the middle, then coming off in spots on the upper barrel, the removable end-cap (the eraser's under this end), and now the pocket clip. When it was new, the pen could easily have been mistaken for a high-end pen, but not anymore. I only use the pen with my PDA and paper documents in a normal office setting, it's not like I work in a machine shop or hazardous waste facility.I also agree with the previous review concerning the lack of smoothness in the mechanism and the color of the stylus, but other than that the pen works just fine. I just hope they've improved their paint process!"
2,Misleading,"I was looking for a classy looking pen, with a stylus and mechcanical pencil. After looking for a while I found and bought this pen. I though to myself after seeing the 4 in 1 pen I thought hmm added bonus it comes with one extra pen. But i just got it today and it only has a stylus, black pen, and mechcanical pencil. I also wanted my pen to have gravity slect on it also. I saw in the desciption ""see and click mechcanism"" so i assumed that that is what it meant. WRONG! So over all this pen is good but not at all what i expected form the description."
1,The Golfer's Mind,"I'm not rating the book but the service. In fact, I already rated your service as being substandard. Requested the book on 12/15 and it didn't come until 12/29. I don't care what your arbitrary tolerance delivery dates are, I will think hard before ordering a book from you in anticipation that it will come in a reasonable time frame."
4,"Good, but....","This book is very similar to the other Psyche books. Very easy to read, not so easy to implement."
3,A bit so so,"I bought this book for a college school project. The book was in good condition, but it looks like it was stolen, because the sticker said ""Property of Maricopa County Library"""
5,Lost Legend,"Gil Scott Heron was a legend, as well as a poet. His poems/music were thought provoking and often well ahead of it's time. His music should be required listening, especially for this generation of hip hop artists, but also for all African Americans, and anyone interested in hearing the soul of Black America. His music not only taught but sounded good. He was one of the earlier edu-tainers. His apperance in his later years was as gritty as his music, due to his lifestyle. This dvd is excellent and since there are few videos of him at work, I would recommend this dvd highly."
2,Cheap and ill fitting,Cheap and ill fitting. Its going back. Cut is all wrong and assembly is sloppy. Overall I would not recommend this product.
1,"Cotton Lace Sleep Chemise, Pink M","I love the way the nightgown looks as pictured on the website and when I actually received it. I thought it was perfect. I checked the size chart shown for the product and purchased the medium size based on the chart. When I tried it on I was very disappointed because it was very clingy, actually very form fitting and way too small. I am disappointed too because I am going to have to go to the trouble of returning it and will most likely have to pay for shipping and handling. I doubt I will re-order it in a large, because the medium size was more like an extra small and I don't want to re-order and risk having to pay for shipping and returning again. The nightgown was on sale and I was thrilled with the price, but the thrill is gone when you have to go to the trouble of taking it to the post office and paying the charges to return it. The size chart was way off on this product."
5,Great,fast shipment and product was as advertised as well as being good quality will do business again with this merchant
5,excelente producto,"excelente producto de algodon, de muy buena calidad, bello diseño, muy recomendable, buen tiempo de envio. buena atencion y buen trato."
4,cotton lace chemise,"I really like this chemise! The size runs a little big, I wear large shirts, and i could fit into a medium for this."
2,I've read better,"This book is confusing at times. I bought it because it was a required book in my channel pathology class, but the instuctor (from China) said the book material wasn't great, so we didn't even use it."
2,::Cough Cough sputter sputter::,"Okay, well, I am not alone in my assesment of this book. This book creeps along at an alarmingly slow pace, and the Chinese to English translation leaves me thinking that... well, something may have been lost in translation. They use some English words in a rather arcane way, and you have to stop, think, decode, and move on to the next sentence. Definitely not my first choice--I think this up there with my assesment of CAM."
2,mediocre at best,The illustrations lacked interest for my three children. I thought there would be a listing and introduction of more of Leonardo's investions and paintings.
2,Take My Breath Away,The lead singer in Take My Breath Away was a terrible singer. God!!! Where did they get this girl!!! The remix version of Take My Breath Away was awesome until the girl sang the song. The great remixed song was killed by a terrible vocalist.
5,Play of Colors = The Legend of Opal Whiteley,"My brother recommended this book, knowing I was going into back surgery and would be laid up for 4 months. It is total escapism! I felt like I was living in Oregon, early Hollywood, London during the bombings ...I was there with Opal. It made me crave peanut bars! The things Opal Whiteley did to survive, shocked me. My brother said Play of Colors has already been optioned for movie rights. So be sure to read it before Hollywood ruins it! This gal's life story is the most interesting life story I have ever read."
2,"Great story, bad delivery","While the story of these three generations of women, who are trying to learn and heal from their past mistakes, is very touching, Greene's delivery of it is awkward and filled with too much of what seems to be psychoanalysis. The conversations these women have with each other-about repeating past mistakes and verbally analyzing the root of their fears and insecurities-are too deliberate. Conversations sound more like therapy sessions than actual conversations between mother and daughter. It adds a dry, heavy tone to the book that doesn't go well with some of the characters' quirky antics. And I have never really understood why Susan was so hesitant about getting together with Jon and Lydia's rebellion against her previous life is a little fragmented, jumbled, and undeveloped."
5,Look no further,"If you like cinnamon bears, try these and you will never want the ones at the nearest convenience store again. They are to the other cinnamon bears what the authentic jelly bellies are to the stale grocery store imitation. Amazon should set up a subscription order for these as they will be arriving at my house monthly. Also, I know they are costly, but due to their intensity and the satisfaction of something that truly sates your appetite you will eat a lot fewer (which in essence makes them much lower in calories per serving than the poor imitations. Also, they do not contain high fructose corn sweetener (just regular sugar and corn syrup)."
3,Decent at best,"I read reviews on this website before purchasing the DVD so I knew it would be slightly different than the original comic. I knew this had to be the case, a true movie adaptation would have taken several hours to properly tell. What I didn't expect, however was how few similiarities the two stories would share. Their portrayal of the relationship between Lois and Superman was most disturbing to me. It made sense to leave out the Justice League and Cadmus Labs so that the story could be more easily told, but there were certain aspects of the fight which should not have been left out. While this telling does open the story up to newcomers it risks alienating true fans of the Superman comic. I still haven't tried the special features yet, hopefully there will be a few gems there to salvage this purchase."
2,"Mediocre, At It's Best","Mediocre in execution, adaptation, animation and acting, and that's when it's actually hitting it's best stride. The replacement of all the major voice actors really hurts, as the new cast just doesn't work as well as the superior cast they've replaced. The animation quality ranges from bad to mediocre, to occasional flashes of more, but an animated movie that looks terrible has a huge strike against it.The movie is different from the DC TV shows, aside from the inferior animation(it's ridiculous that the TV shows have better animation and style than this drek), in that it shows blood and people getting killed.For those who say it has to be judged on its own, don't go there - without the memory of the source material, not a single star would be warranted for this review.The comic firmly established the epic nature of this battle, something the movie fails to do.2 stars, solely due to the original source amterial.On the plus side, I've a new coaster for my drinks."
2,Darker than anything Cartoon Network would run,"I also haven't read the novel, but I'm a big fan of the cartoon adaptations on Carton Network and network TV (Justice League, The animated series. etc.). This was a complete departure from those series, and way darker in storyline. The level of violence in this feature was fairly over the top, and even has one gory scene in it. The story moved rather quickly in an attempt to fit into 78 minutes and it felt rushed, but it was entertaining and worth a 99 cent rental. I wouldn't pay more than that to see it."
2,What did they do to my favorite story,"I've been waiting since the comic book and graphic novel for DC to step up and turn this into an animated or live action movie. When I saw the commercial, I just knew I had to get it. Then I watched it and was totally disappointed. They took so much away from the story that was told in the graphic novel. Where were earth's hero's at Superman's funeral? Where all those who claimed to be superman? Steel, superboy, etc? I know it would be hard to squeeze into one movie, but to tell the story this way would have been worth waiting on a couple more movies. The story was okay but I wanted THE STORY."
1,Worst comic adaptation EVER!,"What is SO disappointing is they could have done this justice but they were just too lazy. There is no way this story could have been told in 75 minutes. They should have done this the same way as the book. A trilogy - The Death of Superman, A World Without Superman, and The Return of Superman. They only people who will like this garbage are people who have never read the original comic or novel. If you saw this movie and thought wow that was pretty good, but you've never read the story, do yourself a favor. After you read the story you will realize how bad this movie really is. It is not even an abridged version of the story more like the ADHD version."
2,Not worth the hype! Disappointing story.,"The story line was drastically changed from the comics and its a major disappointment. Also, the uncaring destruction of Metropolis that Superman contributes to during the fight scenes is sooooooo out-of-character. He takes Doomsday into orbit and then pile-drives him back onto Metropolis creating a vast crater....I think that was the ""over-the-line"" moment."
1,Non-canon crap fest,"This doesn't even attempt to follow the graphic novel or the book. Nowhere in this joke of a film do they mention the alternate supermen, Kal-El's true relationship with Lane, ...It's a complete reimagining of the legend. And it's a terribly bad one at that. Lex clones Superman for his own gain, the Justice League is never mentioned, not even in passing, Jimmy becomes a paparazzi, and many more horrible ideas.Add in horrible graphics and you have the worst Superman movie ever produced. I watched it on my HDTV and it's so pixelated I felt like I was watching a cut scene from a Super Nintendo game.Avoid this movie at all costs. Seriously, Glitter and Gigli are masterpieces compared to this schlock."
2,What?!,"Yes, I gave it two stars... barely. This version does provide *some* entertainment value.This film is ""based on the Award-winning 'The Death of Superman' triolgy."" Really? Was this story based on more than just the character names? Did the screenwriters even do any research past page two of the ""trilogy?"" This is a very loose adaptation of the Death of Superman story.Sorry, but here's a spoiler: Superman's funeral takes place less than half an hour into the film! Where is the character development? Where is the dramatic build? Where is the Justice League? Why did I waste my time watching this when I could have just re-read the graphic novel and gotten a better version of the whole story?You know, I was really hoping to see a big budget, live action version of ""The Death of Superman"" that stuck to the original story. I thought I would give this one a chance. My advice: rent it or wait for it on the discount shelves... shouldn't be too long."
1,Terrible!,"If you're a fan of the comic book superman and that death of superman storyline, DO NOT watch this! You will want to tear out your eyes by the end. First, graphically it was aweful. Second, they screwed up the storyline. I wish I had my money back for this one."
3,Very light version from the comic,"Kiddie version, the comic rocked really gory battle, this movie is for kids, they dont show when other heroes fight Doomsday."
1,Very disappointing doomed superman adaption..............,"I was estatic when this was released by after watching it I was very disappointed. The comic and the book were much more eventful and both had exellent follow up story lines after the death of superman and the rice of the 4. This adaption only had the two supermen what happened the the cyborg superman, the visored superman, the cloned superboy, and the man of steel. Over all very disapointing."
5,Superman vs Doomsday,"I actually bought this as birthday gift for my husband who dictated the following review:The storyline was excellent! I didn't really care from the way Superman was drawn -- the lines in his face made him look middle-aged! However, that being said, I liked the cloned Superman who had an ""Batman"" attitude when it came to dealing with criminals. I was also impressed with the costume of the resurrected Superman. This is definitely not a kiddie show -- the PG-13 should be respected. I always like the Doomsday story and felt the dvd was definitely worth the money! Buy it and enjoy!"
5,Best Superman Story Ever Told,"This is definitely the best Superman Story Ever Told put to film. The action is very well drawn, the acting is very serious and heartfelt. Try not to picture Ann Heche when listening to Lois Lane's voice, as I found this difficult to do. The acting is still superior, and the story makes up for the fact that they could not include all of the characters from the original book. I think any Superman fan will find this movie to their liking. I look forward to more animated movies like this in the future, hopefully. I only question why they have to be 75 minutes or less, why not longer? For me they always seem too short and I wind up wanting more after it is done."
3,"ANOTHER ""SUPER ATTEMPT"" OFF TRACK","Boy, is this a tough one. Once again, the ""powers that be"" bring us an off shoot of a sure fire project with what they think it should be instead of the fans. Make no mistake about it, this is a must addition to any Superman DVD collection as it is very well produced but falls short in all the areas you can read in other reviews. The producers and directors of the Superman movies also appear to be of the notion that the public is tired of the Man of Steel on the big screen. The problem is, we're tired of the same old story being retold as was the problem with Superman Returns which is Superman, the Movie retold. A great idea would be to bring this epic battle to the big screen. I've written an outline myself which also includes Batman in the movie to give it that ""World's Finest"" flavor. There's no doubt in my mind that such a project would line 'em up out the theater doors like they've never seen. But, I'm just a simple fan. What in the world would I know?"
4,It has a high entertainment value for casual Superman fans.,"Compared to the original Graphic novels, the DVD is quite thin, but it is still wonderful eye candy. Die Hard fans will find a lot to criticize, but it does have a high entertainment value for the ""not-so-die-hard"" fans of the franchise. I didn't LOVE it, but I really liked it a lot. But I am easy to please. I really loved Batman's movie Mystery of the batwoman, if that is any indicator of my tastes."
2,"fell short of the comic series, good effort, rushing through the story doesnt help","Having read the comic trade back for this a few years ago, I found the story quite rich and entertaining, so when i found this on sale i felt it was worth a shot.I am quite dissapointed.Although a lot of work has gone into it, i cant help but feel that the dvd was really rushed to get the story over and done with.This easily could have been stretched over 2 DVD's with the complete story in it. Then again I would have probably not used this version of animated superman too, as lois lane is annoying the whole time and jimmy olsen is (to be candid) an idiot.I wouldnt suggest watching this if you read the original comic series. Quite a let down."
4,superman doomsday,"I bought this for my son, who said it was a good video, but just not the quality he was expecting. He said he would still watch it again though. Amazon got it to him very quickly, of course. I love being able to buy things online, and have it shipped directly to him, and not have to worry about the packaging and extra shipping charges."
2,God I hate Hollywood!,"I know that when you translate a book to a movie you have to edit and there are things that just won't make the cut. Roger Sterns Novel ""THE DEATH AND LIFE OF SUPERMAN"" had an enormous scope but when you cut so much that the story has little or no resemblance to the original it is enough to make you want to scream! OK the Jonathan Kent portion of the story given the evolution of the Superman Saga and add the traditional Superman story made sense. But where was John Henry Irons, Cyborg Superman, CADMUS, The Teen Clone of Superman? The mutation of The Eradicator into a Superman Clone and a the Luthor Superman clone army plot would be OK as a Justice League episode but I expected more form this DVD. All in all I was disappointed but after all it was only $14 bucks so what the hell"
1,EVERYONE READ THIS BEFORE BUYING!!!!!!!!!!,"IF YOU ARE SOME PARENT BUYING THIS CARTOON FOR YOU YOUNG CHILD THEN MAYBE JUST DISREGARD THIS BUT IF YOUR A FAN OF THE ORIGINAL STORY THEN READ ON...Okey, I, as a fan of the original ""Death of Superman"" saga feel obligated to tell the truth before you all spend $15 dollars of your hard earned money. DO NOT BUY THIS IT SUCKS!!!!! I dont even feel like writing a long drawn out review for such a crappy piece of material, I just wanted to help. Basically it's nothing like the original story and you'll be disappointed, seriously. If I were you, I would A.) Borrow it from somebody else, or B.) Rent it. Thats all I have to say. If you buy it afyter reading this and are disappointed...I told ya so!!!!!Matt"
1,Does not follow the comic.,"Here I was happy that they had made an animated film adaptation of the Death of Superman comic. Well, this is not an adaptation. It is a poor excuse of a movie. This does not follow the comic at all. Superman fights Doomsday, that much is fromt he comic. He is cloned like in the comic. Lex Luthor is the cloner though. The clone is not Superboy. There are none of the other supermen. This is not worth anyones time."
2,Doomsday?,"The movie was ""dark"" not something you would have in a saturday morning cartoon but not ""dark"" enough. At no point did I feel that the human race was in a Doomsday situation. It seems that the producers had a perfect script infront of them, that being the original comic version of the ""Death Of Superman"" to work with. Unfortunately it was bundled all wrong, the key points of the comic were lost and replaced by cheap moments. If you know the comic the fight is done during the day when Superman gets energized with the sun but in the movie it was night time, the love scences with Lois are fast and dont make much sence, I dont want to spoil the whole thing but in the comic both Superman and Doomsday die while giving each other a fatul blow, that does not happing here. Like I said I dont want to spoil so just let me end with this, its not the comic version its a saturday cartoon with a little extra blood and broken necks."
1,Ham handed and preachy.,"Really I should have stopped after they dropped the nugget that Lex Luthor had cured AIDS and MS but wanted to sit on the cures until he could make a bigger profit as treatments, just in case you didn't know he was evil. Then they juxtaposed that with Superman wringing his hands over not finding ""the cure for cancer."" This was in the first 10 minutes or so. Just awful. The lowest point since Superman on the N64"
2,"Great Idea, Bad Execution","The animation is very similiar to the justice league dvd. I thought this would be very similiar to the comic but it wasn't even close, and it was a summarized version of the comics. It didn't even involve the other supermen...It wouldn't be bad if i hadn't read the comics, which i suggest over this..."
2,"Well told story, TERRIBLE animation!","I wonder, is the reason they keep putting out movies with this caliber of animation because somewhere, some big-wig still thinks of most animation to still be for kids? Even in this day and age of a growing number of ""Mature"" viewers who rememeber all of these stories from our youth, do the makers of the movies still think that they are only for kids on Saturday morning? This telling of the demise of argueably the most popular super hero of all time was disappointment and heart breaking because of the typical Saturday morning animation. I think that they should have used some of the animators from Batman: Gothem Nights. With its cutting edge, Japanese animation genious, the 6 stories seemed to flow together seemlessly and made for a much better view than Doomsday. The same could be said for The New Frontier the telling of how the Justice League was founded. I just hope the new Wonder Woman movie is not done in the same manner."
4,Good if seriously condensed film version of graphic novel,"I have the three graphic novels in the Death of Superman storyline: Death Of,World Without A Superman, and the mega-epic Return of Superman; all excellent. This animated adaptation is good solid fun although it lacks the complexity and scope of the original books, but you cant totally translate everything on the page into an animated film since you only have a limited timeframe anyway unless it were a live action piece. Still, very good addition to the DC Animated Universe films."
4,Good Movie,"I never read the Death of Superman, so I don't have anything to compare it to. I enjoyed the story. (Great fight between Doomsday and Supes). The rebirth was kinda cheesy, but it worked. Good animated movie."
4,"Superman dead-oh, the horror!","I dont' usually get excited about 'cartoons', even if they are aimed at a more mature crowd-but this one is worth the time.I'm sure most people know that Superman meets his toughest adversary-EVER-in this movie. Without giving the plot away, I only can say that you can really get into this movie. It's that interesting. A definite buy. I own it, and have watched it with the grandkids, and my oldest son. Enjoy the ride."
3,Doomsday - For five minutes,"Quick and easy:Story: Nothing compared to the source material but a little interesting.Animation: Still the same ol' junk.Voice Acting: TOP NOTCH!Extras/Special Features: Those are worth the price alone. I enjoyed them more than the actual film itself.So Superman is dead of about 5 minutes in this movie. Not much to get worked up over for me.Unless you're a major out and proud comic geek like me, this is a rental for everyone else."
1,Not What It Claims To Be,"I was very disappointed with DC over this product. It was touted as The Death of Superman, one of the greatest selling books of all time, in an animated version never done before. The only problem was, it barely followed the book, and the fight between Superman and Doomsday, the title of the DVD, was like 2 minutes long. The rest of the DVD was about Lex trying to kill Superman with Superman clones, which is alright I guess. I was already unhappy by that point and didn't care for the rest of it. They talk about this product being the first Superman piece to get a PG-13 rating, which I thought would be cool because we were supposed to be watching Superman die. Instead, they used it to say a few soft cuss words like the A-word and B-word and Superman bled a little before he died. That was it. Lame. This DVD isn't really for real small children, it isn't for someone that loves the Death of Superman, it isn't for....anyone."
3,"Entertaining, but nothing epic","I'm going to flat out say it. Superman is pretty ugly, and all it took were these ugly lines to represent cheekbones. I also hated Lois' Lane's voice. With that out of the way - the movie was overall acceptable. I'm quite sadden that the Justice League wasn't a part of this - and they had to cut a lot out to keep it under 2 hours.But it's worth a watch.It's as good as the saturday morning Superman Adventures. A tad bit better though. But is it better than any of the Batman animated movies? Not even close."
3,Should have waited a while,"The movie was well designed. Although I would much rather the movie have stuck to Superman v Doomsday, instead of merging it with The Return of Superman. I wasn't terrible impressed with the actors picked for the voices."
2,poor First Offering,"Choppy Animation, revised story from the orginal comic and an overall cheap feel. The Death of Superman was a comic Classic with all types of plot twist. This is a let down in a major way."
2,Misses the mark,"I bought this flick not expecting to have a recreation of the Death of Superman story from the comics, but at the very least expecting a good film. I got neither.The animation overall is decent. Quite similar to the Justice League style if you're familiar with that. However, some of the changes to the faces of the characters are rather distracting and quite frankly, ugly.My real beef with the film is the story. It seems very disjointed. I have no problem with them not sticking to what happened in the comics very closely, but what they replace it with is far far worse. After the first act (which is the best act, containing the fight with Doomsday which is fantastic) I quickly lost interest and wanted to turn it off. I held out hoping the last act would redeem the film, it doesn't in any way."
1,Rent only if it's free,"I've never read the original DC comics regarding Superman's death so I came into this movie without bias. I hate giving it a 1-star rating but it just wasn't very good. The animation was on par with Saturday morning cartoons, the voice acting (with the exception of James Marsters) was unemotional and stale and the violence relatively tame for a PG-13 movie. After the movie ended I was left wondering, ""That's all? That's all the fuss was about?""Unless you REALLY need to see this film don't waste your money. Rent it only if it's free."
1,Any one episode of JL is better,"Here was an opportunity to put a little more time and effort into an animated feature as compared to the half hour episodes of Justice League (basically handled by the same team). It was an opportunity missed. The only ""added value"" you get from this direct to video movie is some mild cussing. I guess throwing in some foul language makes it more ""interesting"" or ""edgey""? Anyway, to get to the point, any half hour episode of J.L. is better than this movie. And if you watch the ads you'll see a season set on sale for $19.99 at various retail stores. Pick up a season set of J.L. instead of this missed opportunity."
2,This is not what I wanted,"If you have never read the comics that this storyline is based on then you may like the movie. As for what it claims to be.....it is definetly NOT the Doomsday story. The only thing that is in common with the books is the names of the characters and maybe a total of 10 min. total footage for the whole movie. There are no other supermen, no justice league, no funeral(except some humans leaving flowers) and they don't even capture the original final scene of their deaths. It only has two stars because it is a decently made movie but remember if you want to see the doomsday story than do NOT buy this movie."
5,EXCELLENT!!!!,"I was never a fan of Dan Jurgens ""Death Of Superman"" storyline back in the day. BUT...This video was great!! A modern day homage to the rather dated story from the 1990's where Kal-El sports a mullet. *Ugh*If you are a fanboy/girl of the Bruce Timm Superman: TAS then this 'toon will be slightly off in the animation. But, trust me, you stop noticing after getting swallowed in the storyline.And, if none of that sells you on this movie, then any Kevin Smith fans should be sure to buy this because Kevin himself is in it and guest stars as himself and is voiced by himself. His line from this animated movie ties in with one of his many stories he relates during his ""An Evening With Kevin Smith"" showings.Excelsior!"
4,Comic come to life,"Even though this story is over 10 years old, it was handled in a new and refreshing way. Usually, these types of adaptations do not translate well, but I was moderately surprised how this turned out. The only minor issues i have were with what could only be described as the ""chiseled"" look of Superman's face, which was distracting to say the least. And the voice charecterizations. I guess I'm used to the voice of Superman from his own series as well as from the JLA series. Other than that, highly recommended."
3,It's a Good Show,"It's a good show. It has good animation, sound, and graphics. The animation is fine but it isn't detailed or realistic like the comic books are. One thing that makes it interesting is an audio commentary by the producers speaking about how and why the movie was made. The background art is digitally designed and detailed. In the comic books, issue after issue, a war between Superman and Doomsday continues. In this movie, the battle is short and a totally different story is portrayed."
3,Should have been 5 stars,"With Brice Timm at the helm I though for sure this would have blown me out of my shoes. The fight was fantastic and despite other opinions I think the voice acting was too. What I thought the real problem with this movie was is that it missed how Superman's death effected the world and didn't feel as big as OH MY GOD SUPERMAN IS DEAD! I think it was the lack of other heroes getting whomped on was a big missing piece that made it clear that superman was the only thing powerful enough to stop Doomsday and he's a real danger to the planet. And the whole return was so far removed from the comic to fit in a movie I really didn't like it.It looks to me like it was made with an attempt to be appealing new viewers who don't know the storyline rather than fans, but something went wrong in the writing for this one."
3,"Decepción,","Bueno, compre está pelicula teniendo claramente que no sería el comic pasado a video. Pero en realidad aunque me hice las expectativas más pobres, estas fueron muy altas.La historia una adaptación demasiado cambiada, donde la muerte de Superman es un mero trámite para una historia nueva, que contradice muchas de las cosas que pasaron en el cómic.La calidad sin duda es buena, una buena animación con un logrado doblaje de los personajes.Sin duda lo mejor son los extras donde se puede conocer a las caras de los creadores de la verdadera muerte de Superman."
3,Don't expect the Comic come to life!,"Overall I found this version quite disappointing. One, Doomsday's presence is only for a short period of time. Two, the whole return of Superman was entirely revamped. I really hope they try and remake the original comic book version. I would pay good money to see that. Had I not read the comics I would say this was a fairly good DVD! I give it a 3 out of 5."
3,It was okay,I saw it and it was alright. It could have followed the original story line and include both superboy and steel and they did have enough time to do so since this was only an hour and seventeen minutes...it would help with the climatic battle scene where the man of steel could have used some help. I do 'preciate the producers wanting a more cerebral storyline with Lois and the dark premise of the film to allow it to be more realistic that a saturday cartoon and I would buy it for my collection. It well worth the online rental fee.
3,Disappointing adaptation...,I was looking forward to this movie and knew it couldn't possibly tell the exact story contained in the comic books. This adaptation changes quite a bit and didn't really capture the story very well. The highlight of this DVD is definitely the documentary on the creation of the comic storyline. That alone is worth the viewing...
2,Very Disappointing,"I won't write a book dissecting every minute detail here; suffice it to say, the animation is sub-standard, with strange cheek lines on Superman that are a bad distraction. Ann Heche was a terrible Lois Lane, and Adam Baldwin was completely flat as Superman. The story didn't pick up the emotion of the loss of Superman as well as the Justice League cartoon did in a 30min episode, which is telling. Overall, I was very disappointed in the way this was done; it was a big letdown after all of the great writing of the comic series."
1,This could have been the best selling animated movie of the year,"DC skimped on this project. There is no way around it. There was a cd adaptation of this story done a couple of years ago that followed the story and was a delight to listen to. This movie was a disappointment. The writer did not abridge the story, he rewrote it to a point where it is unrecognizable. To do this movie right would require a three hour movie to be produced. That was the length of time of the cd adaptation that I liked. This movie was about an hour and a half.Spoiler warning for those familiar with the story.No SteelNo SuperboyNo Yellow Visored SupermanNo CadmusNo other Heroes.DC please redo this and do it thoroughly. People will buy it. Seriously. Ask the Lord of the Rings people if fans will buy a three hour movie if the movie is well done."
2,WOW! What A Disappointment,"I have pretty much the same gripe as the countless others who didnt like this DVD. Storyline sucked, not by the comic, etc. etc. But I wanted to point out another annoying aspect of this cartoon... the voice of Lois Lane. It was horrible!! it sounded like the lady held her nose closed throughout the entire voice-over! so annoying... no connection with her characters emotions... monotoned nose-talking... completely turned me off numerous times over. The only thing keeping me going was the hope that it would get better... but unfortunately it never did."
4,Greatest Animation Superman Movie ever made,"Having read the Death of Superman over a thousand times I must say this is the greatest animation Superman I have ever seen. Forget the original Death of Superman comic as this movie is a whole new take on it. The battle between Supes and Doomsday is the best battle between any super characters ever presented on a animation movie . The scene with the Toy man I think is absolutely fabulous , and the fact that this is a PG13 rated movie makes it all the worth . For long I've been longering for american animation movie that resembles the violence on Anime , this movies just does that, it was worth all the wait the months I waited for it to come out. I truly recommend it and give it a 10 , Hope all future DC comics are made in PG13 format , Truly a gem for all Superman fans out there"
1,Fatal,"Lastima que la linea de la pelicula no siga en nada a la linea del libro. no tiene que ser una interpretacion textual o algo parecido, pero al menos una adaptacion que respete situaciones claves como el espiritu de Jonathan Kent, o a la Liga de la Justicia en el funeral o incluso la misma imagen de Luthor, sin mencionar la estupidez de que Luisa Lane este enamorada de Superman y de Khal-El y no de Clark Kent. Vamos Warner y DC Comics, un poquito de respeto a la inteligencia de sus lectores. A pesar de todo, la animacion y la brutalidad de Doomsday fueron muy bien hechos. Lastima la pobreza de la historia."
3,What?,"""What?"" is what goes through your mind when you watch this if you have any idea of what happened in the original comic. The quality was there in the production but there was not enough that came out in the end. Where's doomsday in all of this again?"
1,Loosley Based Swill,"How disappointing was this. It was so far from the story of doomsday it was rediculous. The only commonality it had with the actual book was 1: Superman, 2 : Doomsday, 3: Lois, a poor adaption, with an attempt to create 3rd dimension by throwing in a very ""grown up"" arguement between Lois and Kal-El.No other league memebers, no supergirl, no plateu, no climax, just a poor beginning, which diluted the ending, how disappointing.The big name actors did nothing for the series, nor did the art work, I would've suggested they saved some money and used the artists/style of the Justice League series, as well as the fantastic voice actors from the series, and created a closer story line to the actual comic book sequence. It was SWILL. Don't waste your money I did."
2,Superman DoomsDay,"I was extremely disappointed in this. I am a huge Superman fan and find it difficult to beleive that the story could not have followed the original line. I appreciate the effort and I was excited when I learned of the movie, then I saw it...ahhhh... if you are not going to say true to the story line then please...DONT BOTHER!"
3,Why fix what was not broken,"First off I really thought this show overall was pretty good. Much more adult orientated. The biggest problem I have is all the voice changes. I mean the same actors were used throughout Batman the Animated Series, then the Superman Series, and ongoing into the Justice League animated series. But for some reason the makers of this show decided like many American animation projects to get big name actors versus the actors that made these characters who we loved or loved to hate. Clancy Brown did a wonderful job as the voice of Lex Luthor, now they have some crappy wimpy sounding Lex Luthor. WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? Keep the team of voice actors that gave us fans what we wanted."
1,"An okay movie If you DON'T know the original story, Otherwise IT STINKS out loud","If you have read the whole DEATH OF SUPERMAN, WORLD WITHOUT SUPERMAN, and RETURN OF SUPERMAN you will be greatly DISSAPOINTED. This version leaves out the JUSTICE LEAGUE,SUPERGIRL, SUPERBOY, STEEL, ERADICATOR and such. The story line has the basics Doomsday gets free, Doomsday and Superman ""die"" and Superman returns to fight one of the Supermen. Other then that this movie is horrible, bad annimation, forced present day culture references, and oh so many other things. If your a true comic book fan, don't bother wasting your time."
1,This is terrible,"I don't understand how anyone could like this. The writers of this dvd movie took a excellent story and completely destroyed it. What happened? Where the writers not given enough time to write the story?, Did WB give such a short time frame to create this movie that this is a rushed project?I loved the original story of Doomsday, If you did too you will find this very disappointing. I expected to be wowed, instead I found myself constantly checking to see how much time was left."
4,Voices :(,"The movie is great--and you should buy it. But the change in the voice cast from the original series is VERY disappointing. The worst is Anne Heche as Lois Lane. No longer do you get the strong, confident voice of Dana Delaney--now you can't help but picture ""ditzy blonde.)I'm a James Marsters fan, but Clancy Brown was a much better Lex as well. Superman, Jimmy, and the rest are fine. It's really Lois and Lex that break the immersion if you're a fan of the originals."
1,Just God Awful,"Terrible, it was just terrible. The fight was quick and Superman was only gone for a few minutes. Only one rouge Superman showed up and no other members of the JLA made an appearance. It's just simply a bad adaptation. Do not buy."
4,Good Show,"I just watched this and even though I was a little disappointed that the looks of the characters are not like the Superman cartoons of the late nineties especially Lois(too anne heck look, she looked better in the tv cartoon series) I thought this was still worth watching,if just for entertainment value?superman also looked a little Blockish.My only beef was the art work."
3,It is not that bad,"My three stars come becuase for me the real voices of the main characters should have been the once for the animated series.The story is AN ADAPTATION of the doomsday saga in comics. I read it all those years ago, and find the movie very pleasing.The doomsday part could have been detailed better, and the returned a bit more dramatic than to save us from the evil clone.Superman's interpretation looked more like a man in his forties, than in his early thirties.Lois Lane's interpretation looked more like Lana Lang from Superman the Animated series down to the mini skirt.The movie had a good theme, but a lack of better animation to follow on the steps of SAS, Justice League and Justice League Unlimited.I like it and you should have it, if you want to have fun, not if you are looking for something out of the comics or the previews series."
3,Good,Picture quality was awesome and storyline plausible. Didn't really like Anne Heche as the voice of Louis Lane though.
3,Good,"The film just have the superman figth. There are more events in the comic, one of the most important is when Doomsday destroy the Justice League and the film doesn't have nothing about it"
4,A Decent Adaptation,"After taking the time to read several of the reviews, I find myself agreeing. Nothing could do the comics justice. A story that large simply could not be told in the space allowed. Nonetheless, the Doomsday tale, though abridged, remains a solid addition to the DC universe. Lex's monologues that begin and end the movie are stellar and really set the tone for the film."
3,"A Pretty Good Story Line, But Get Rid of Heche.","I'm not a comic book fan or Superman expert in any sense of the word but I do like this feature. My only qualm is looking at the very young and sexy animated Lois Lane and hearing a 50 something, cigarette raspy, Bensonhurst beauty parlor, housewife's voice emanating from the character. It's like going out with a babe and discovering she has butcher cutting hands. Can Warner Animation please redub her with say Summer Glau? Hell, I'll even take Kim Delaney or Charo.Otherwise, yes it's a good movie for any adult who likes action flicks to watch and eat popcorn to."
2,Lacked drama,"This animation lacked the intensity the death of Superman should have. The art in my opinion was stiff and angular. The storyline itself was more like a dust cover recap of the comic book series on Earth- 4. What should have been a 4- hour disc was reduced down to 1 hour of Saturday morning cartoons.Superman: Doomsday is properly titled, it's the end of a superhero series."
2,ehhhhhh,If u have read the book you will be disappointed. If you haven't read the book you will still be disappointed.
2,Pretty bad,"I ended up watching this after watching a string of good GL cartoons and the one about Wonder Woman, etc. This one is just way weaker. Voice acting is pretty lame and the writing is pretty poor. I was pretty disappointed."
2,Only So-So,"Maybe we're all spoiled by the excellent work over the past decade. This certainly isn't as good as the animated Superman, Batman, and Justice League that were televised. Not even close...."
1,Again?,"Ok, this is the same exact film that was released in 2007 except it comes with a disc 2. So, if you want to see new behind the scenes, this is good. But, the film also is very unenjoyable. It doesn't have the drama of the comic book story nor the characters. In my opinion, what made the ""Death and Life of Superman"" so fun to read was the reactions that the other heroes in the DC Universe had to Doomsday before the final fight and later the ""Funeral for a Friend"" series then the ""Reign of the Supermen"" plot. The Death of Superman rocked the entire DC Universe and that fact is simply ignored in this animated feature. For the DC Animators to do this right, they would have to tell the story in a Justice League Unlimited story and be a 3 parter at the very least!"
2,Cut and paste and a waste...,"This is very chopped version of the original story arc, where Doomsday comes across as just some thug that manages to ""kill"" the man of steel. There's little build up to the main event, which comes in about 20 minutes, then the rest of the movie is built around Lex developing some army of Supermen and some hints at Eradicator story line. Overall I was really disappointed with the treatment of the death of Supeman, but it was not based on the visual merits of the film, which in and of themselves are done very well. PS to the creators: Superman has HEAT vision, not lazer vision, therefore there would have been no bouncing off of a mirror to create the ""extraction"" scene. He would have melted that glass in a heart beat. :)"
2,Some what disappointed,"I am confused about something. The Amazon description of this DVD says that it is one disc only. The Wal Mart edition that I bought has 2 discs, the second of which is a CD-ROM containing the artwork from the comic in which Superman dies. I recommend the 2 disc version if you can find it. If it had not been for the second disc and the additional special features on disc 1, I would have been very disappointed in this DVD. Having bought the complete graphic novel when it was originally released, I thought the DVD would be great. I am just let down that Superman's death came so quick (about 25 minutes in). I think it would have been much better if had ended with the defeat of Doomsday and the Death of Superman. It just seemed to me like the writers were more focused on the events after Superman's death and his resurrection instead of the events leading up to it. A second movie at some time could have dealt with the return of Superman and the events after his death."
3,"Good Death, Bad Funeral","I remember standing in line to buy the comic when it first came out, and how my jaw hit the floor and stayed there the whole time I was reading it. It was a great story. I understand that they need to make changes to make it fit into a 75min. video, but I was extremely disappointed with the funeral scene. In the comic, there were dozens of DC Universe heroes attending Superman's funeral; Batman, Wonder Woman, heck most of the Justice League paid their respects. It was one of the most memorable scenes from the book. However in the video, nothing. Not one other superhero showed up. That reason alone really took a lot of the ""punch"" out of the funeral scene, which in it's self felt rather rushed. Well, that's my two cents. The video is good, just not great."
3,not bad,"for the first in the line of these dvds, this was ok. i'm use to the newer ones & i think the cast was off for the most part, however. this the first one they did, so of course they need to start fresh, like thier interviews are included. i liked the story ok. not a huge fan of him, but i saw the 90s series all most of the time. so, i'm partial to tim daley. say what you will, i have to say as these stories progress they get better. & if your a fan u must have the 2 disc for sure. amazon will help you out w/prices, if you don't have an account. if not you should, its free."
3,Expected More,"I am a huge Superman fan. (Ask all of my friends and then take a look at what I get at Christmas time)For me this movie was a huge let down as much as it was hyped.The animation is on par with the regular tv series.Having collected the orginal story line all of those years ago this film didn't stick close to it at all.Which was a huge let down considering how indepth it was.And Yes, I know you couldn't fit that long story line into one movie.I just expected more from a Superman/Doomsday thread.I wanted to see more of the impact Superman's death had on the world and other characters.While entertaining it was still a letdown"
3,Not what I was expecting but still good adaptation,"As a comic book reader and a fan of the original Death of Superman books, I was blown away when I heard this was coming out, however even thoughthe story of this animated feature is far different from the original comics it was still enjoyable, full of action and heart to match any of the great Superman stories.Bruce Timm and the DC team have done a great job with this animated movie and I look forward to many more."
1,The worst Superman story ever,"This is the worst, dumbest Superman story ever... can't believe it's been committed to film. Urgh."
1,Y encima mas sacan edicion doble????,"Por favor señores de DC Comics y Warner, tengan decencia, con lo mala que fue la edicion de un disco, ahora quieren sacar la de dos????.A las personas que van a comprar este DVD les recomiendo que primero lean el comic. Si esta pelicula hubiera sido la mitad de lo buena que fue la secuencia del comic hubiera sido un best seller, pero se quedo totalmente lejos de la calidad de la historieta, siendo esta uno de los mas vendidos de todos los tiempos. Espero de verdad que esto ayude a la gente a respetar el espiritu de los comics y principalmente de los mas vendidos, como ha sido la saga de ""La Muerte de Superman""... mejor compren el comic, sera mas economico... y en verdad lo disfrutaran."
1,This is pure marketing trash....,"I read that story and it wa sthe biggest marketing trash DC Comics ever did, I can not belive they are making this into an animated feature, looking at the terrible voice talent they have lined up, It has all the hype of a company that also owns the over-rated AOL software."
3,This battery won't fit with my Sony DSC-P10 camera.,"This battery has a good price, it's about $7.00, includes shipping cost (in compare with the same kind that Radio Shack may sell with $30.00).However, this battery won't fit with my Sony DSC-P10 camera.When I inserted this battery into my camera, for an unknown reason, it popped out (usually the small plastic of the camera will hold it after a ""click""; if I forced to close the door of camera, I realize that the door bend over a little bit.I didn't want to risk my camera; so, I did not use this battery.I contacted the seller, they told me to send it back to them. I don't have time and don't want to pay shipping then I still left it un-use, don't know its quality.I give this product 3 stars though; so if someone has the same problem please alert customers."
4,Works Great,I purchased this battery and it arrived early. The battery is working just fine in the camera with no mulfunctions.
5,The best I've heard in ages...,"The lyrics are moving and the melodies are like a drug! Unquestionably, you need one for every CD player you own."
5,re best of Hycinth,"Onslow's wife is daisy not Violet as your other review states.Daisy is played by Judy Corwell who turned the role into a classic performence and is co star along with Clive Swift,Geoffrey Hughes and Jo Tewson.Without these superb actors to play off of Pat Routledge would not have been able to make her character work."
3,triple movie pack,"I bought this set purely for ""dark city"". The other two movies are okay, but if I had it to do over again I would have just gotten ""dark city"" as a single."
5,Great UML design tool,"I use Visio professionally for software design and am very fond of the UML plug-in that is part of the Professional edition of Visio, and of the template for specifying the Network that the software is part of.Visio, as most Microsoft products, is very user-friendly and the graphic layout is very easy to read - both on Screen and on Print."
5,Love it,"I bought this for myself for christmas. I had ordered an invicta from another online retailer, only it was broken when it arrived. Then I ran across this watch, and decided ""who needs pretty, I want toys!"" Co-workers ask me for the weather report each day.I am a woman, and while this watch is huge, it is way cool, and a good value for the price. Who knows, this watch could save my life one day, lol."
3,Too Big,"The overall watch was really great. All of the applications were cool and worked well. The only problem I had with it was because it was HUGE. I had my 6'3"" brother put it on his wrist and it was sooo big for him. I bought it for my 5'10"" boyfriend and returned it after seeing how big it was."
1,Not satisfied with product,Upon setting the functions especialy the altimator I find the fluctaton in the readous are very inaccurate and upon resetting it many times to factory standards the settings are still not correct.I would like to return this product for a full refund. please advisethank you Bruce Anthony 732-580-9500
2,Lost charm,"I have been a fan of Errol Flynn since very young, but I must say that I am disappointed with this one. Flynn looks old and haggard, with no trace of the brilliance and charm of bygone days.Perhaps one cannot expect the same qualities in any star that has grown old, perhaps except Gary Cooper, who still retained a lot of his qualities even in his last western "" The Hanging Tree "".But as an old fan, this film must be watched anyway."
5,Red Dwarf 8 byte 1,"This seris by BBC video is very funny it will have you laughing from start to finis. The chartors are a dead hologram named Rimmer, a slobe named Lester,and a cat-human named Cat."
4,"mysterious, chess and the Holocaust","Our book club us now reading this book as a foil for The Reader: A Novel, another great short, post-WW II book. If anything, this is better written and has the pace and feel of its 'chess' theme. One need not be a chess aficianado to enjoy this book though my chess nut friends seem to have enjoyed it even more."
5,Great Expansion Set!,This product is wonderful. My 4 year old grandson loves Thomas the Train...the expansion set added to his enjoyment!
1,me me me,not the worst book i have read. The book would be better if Farleigh quite taking about himself. I think he wrote the book looking at himsef in a mirror
2,Poor,"This review is in two parts.The first half of the book provides a biography of the author's life, his experiences in Australia, and his life as a porfessional investor. This is a terrific read, and provides a useful guide to the author's investment philosophy.However the second half of the book, which claims to set out the philosophy in detail, is unstructured and lacks any real detail.The main philoosphy discussed is trend folllwing. However, nowhere is is adequately explained or described, or illustrated.A lot of the philosophy is to be taken on blind faith. Perhaps it's a case where the author has an intrinsic understanding of marketing movements which is difficult to describe or quantify. This book suggests that!"
4,104 preguntas que los niños hacen acerca del cielo y los Ang,"Es un libro de facil lectura para ayudar a los pequeños con algunas inquietudes que se les presentan acerca del Cielo, Dios. Los Angeles, lo bueno, lo malo. Se apoya en versiculos de la Biblia. Con explicaciones sencillas ayuda a que los padres podamos extendernos un poco en estos temas. Mi hija pregunto: Quien escribio este libro?, que sabe mucho sobre los Angeles. Esta lindo"
4,movie,this is a pretty good movie. It holds your attention. i would recommend the movie if you like LMN Movies.
3,For Contractors,I bought this book because I am thinking of building my own house. This book is geared toward contractors and not homeowner-builders.
1,THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE!!!,This game is horrible. So unrealistic it's not even funny.If you want to play a game that is close to reality as it gets thenpick up NHL 2008! The game play is unbelievable. Don't waste your moneywith this game. I cannot stress that enough.
4,Not a Hockey fan,"Let me start by saying that I don't watch hockey, in fact I don't really like hockey. I have always enjoyed hockey games! I have played them since the NES. I am halfway though a full season in franchise mode and find the game to be really fun. The action is fast, the animations are good, and the sound is top notch. I would recommend this game to others. I play games to be entertained, this game entertains me. I may not miss things in this game that true hockey fans do, but I feel this game is well worth the price."
1,Very poor game. Doesn't even come close to the Quality of NHL 08.,This game flat-out sucks in every category except menu music. Everything else is Sega Saturn quality. DON'T BUY THIS GAME!! BUY NHL 08 by EA!THIS GAME SUCKS!!!!!!!THIS GAME SUCKS!!!!!
3,"lots there, but few color pics, some identification guides needed","Lots of example values of pieces. Few have pictures, and even fewer have color pics. The listings are organized by category, but beyond that the details are buried in text and could have been better-separated. (I.e. having date and location of manufacture called out would be helpful.)I have a particular example--Chinese cloisonne pieces of particular ages have hand-written ""China"" on the bottom, while others have stamped ""China"" instead. This book does not clarify which mark identifies which era.This sort of thing definitely could use digitization. I would *love* to be able to search the entire text with keywords. I am a collector of Chinese pieces with bats. These pieces range from cloisonne to porcelains.I do appreciate identification guides for ""signatures"" and makers marks. I would have appreciated a guide to identifying fakes, as many of these items are faked on a regular basis."
2,Nothing Special,Cute cover but nothing special about the rest of the book. Definately for a baby boy.
5,Awesome pole,"I have the 6'6"" paired with a Daiwa Regal 2500xi and 6lb P-Line Floroclear line. I can cast a bobber over a 100ft. I am amazed at the performance of this rod especially for the cheap price. The graphite is GL3 - 47 million modulus (IM8), which is pretty high."
2,Not as pictured,Ordered a 6ft. 2pc. rod and thought I would be getting one with a handle as pictured but I recieved a 5ft.6in. 2pc. rod with a pistol type grip. Feel Amazon needs to split this listing as the longer rods have the handles as pictured. The rod itself was a great deal and the low rating is because of Amazon's fault in listing incorrectly.
4,Gentle and healing,"A friend played this during our weekly Sunday sister meeting, a prayer circle, and it completed the tryst. It set our minds ready to pray and meditate...calming and encouraging of healing, settling into gentleness. It is excellent music for intentional solitary time. Healing is the act, green is the color that represent this good work. There is a place in everyone's life for this music."
3,Toner Order,"Ordering was easy and the Vendor was prompt in shipping the product. Pricing was great! The Vendor was prompt in respoonding to my emails requesting updates. However, it would have been nice to know up-front that the Vendor was going to ship the product via USPS (when the order was placed, the Vendor's notes indicated carrier shipping). The toner cartridges (4 were ordered) came in two separate shipments and were far too large to fit in the mailbox! This necessitated a trip to the Post Office - Twice! A major inconvenience since the Post Office has cut back operational hours. Notwithstanding, I would order again from this Vendor."
3,ok,"This cartridge was refilled. Box and packaging was poor, but cartridge is useable, unlike the other two cartridges I purchased"
4,Beware Speedy Inks = Remanufactured not new,"One of the problems with having multiple vendors for a single product like toner cartridges is that many consider remanufactured the equivilant as new. I normally choose Amazon for such items, but I guess I failed to notice that I chose Speedy Inks (the default vendor).I saved $30 and hopfully spared the environment one more landfill item, however it is not a brand new cartridge. My old cartidge is not quite empty yet, so i cannot attest to quality, but I have my fingers crossed.Most likely, choosing Amazon as a vendor would have provided a new cartridge."
2,"Great selection and player, but a bad recording","It so happens that my dad had this very album in his vinyl LP collection. It was originally released on the Audio Fidelity record label, way back in 1961, and I was hoping to replace it with a CD, because I liked the selection of songs, and I think Leon Berry is clearly a very skilled player. However, in spite of the fact that it was originally supposed to be state-of-the-art HiFi in its day, I am here to report that even the original 1961 LP release sounded very distorted and tinny, and the CD does not sound one bit better. In fact, if anything, the CD is worse--the LP at least had crisper highs and better stereo seperation than the CD. I suspect the original master recording must have been bad, too, and that it would be very difficult to make it sound too much better. Therefore, I am giving this a 2 overall--5 for the selection and the player's skill, and a 1 for the recording quality, which makes the album very difficult to enjoy fully."
1,"Are all copies defective, or just mine?","Video freezes, audio halts,and then continues to the next interruption. Hard to comment on the movie, too irritated to enjoy it. I paid $24.95 for this- a top price for a poorly made product."
3,Carbine,The video was good. I have seen pieces of this movie on cable. It was good to see the full movie
5,Great Movie,I was very Pleased With This Movie...I was told about it by a Friend... found it on Amazon and bought it... It was not a mistake
4,Carbine Williams,"Excellent film as shown on television many years ago....was able to enjoy this when my father told me what the characters were saying. (I am deaf)Now that it is on DVD, why oh why does it NOT have English subtitles?Now that it is 2010, an era of the MOST modern technology, just why won't the makers include subtitles?"
4,grand old movie,I have waited years and years to see this movie again. I thinks it cost .50 to see at saturday matinee
2,"if you're going to buy every cd they have out, get this one last.","This is one for the serious fans only. Very hit and miss. The albums before it, Dopethrone, Come My Fanatics and Electric Wizard, are all classics. The albums after it, We Live and Witchcult Today, are also excellent -- and underappreciated. Let Us Prey is listenable, but any one of the others would be worth getting first."
3,A near perfect masterpiece (3.5 stars),"As slowriotfornewzerokanada said, something had to follow Dopethrone. It defiently wouldn't and couldn't be as great as Dopethrone, but something had to follow it.A year later, and I am still kinda iffy on this album. It's got some great slow doom such as A Chosen Few, Priestess Of Mars and The Outsider. But, what really brings it down is the addition of filler such as We The Undead, which sounds too much like Eyehategod. Night Of The Shape could've been a mouch better song with different production. Also, the album is WAY too short. Dopethrone was a monster, 70 minutes in length, and it didn't mellow out at all. This album is a total of 44 minutes, way too short.However, if you are a casual fan, it would be wise to pick this one up. It's got 4 great songs, and 2 iffy ones."
1,Pointless,"Just saw 'em the other night (2006).Ok, stoner and doom is not exactly my genre. But:They are not talented, noisy, murky, boring.The riffing is cheap.Incredible how people just make a cult out of this unoriginal noise group.Telling you that because I loved Grand Magus and Cathedral on that gig, but this ""cult"" band Electric Wizard just made me sit down and wait for this wall of noise played by these non-musicians to end before I fell asleep.Everyone can ""play"" this music with a fuzz pedal having purchased a guitar for the first time. It will take you 2-3 weeks of practicing. Try it for yourself, maybe you'll end up having a mysterious cult band.Ok, I play jazz and progrock and metal, that's why I'm a bit upset at those doom-stoner bands who can't really play well.Gives music a bad name."
5,Excellent book,This is and excellent book I recomend it I think this book is going to help you to reflect about life.
1,Lo más importante para la iluminación espiritual,"Sin necesidad de entrar en marañas de ocultismo complicado o velado misticismo, este texto describe un sencillo camino para la Iluminación que no requiere de métodos complejos o de un ascetismo que lo aleje de su vida cotidiana. Con las técnicas descritas en este libro, usted podrá mantener elevados estados de consciencia mientras conduce su vehículo o se come una fruta. Es un texto impresionante, de una simplicidad e impòrtancia trascendentales"
5,El poder del ahora,"El poder del ahora es un libro para releer una y otra vez, y cada vez que lo haga, usted lograra profundizar mas y encontrar nuevos significados. Muchas personas querran estudiarlo toda la vida, pues es una guia, un curso completo de meditacion y realizacion. Es un libro con elpoder de cambiar vidas, de despertamos para comprender plenamente quienes somos. El mensaje de Tolle es el mismo que Christo y Buda ensenaron: se puede alcanzar un estado de iluminacion, de realizacion espiritual, aqui y ahora. Es posible liberanos del sufrimiento, de la ansiedad y la neurosis de la vida diaria. Para logario solo tenemos que llegar a comprender que la causa de nuestros problemas no son los demas, ni ""el mundo de alla afuera"", sino nuestra propiamente, aparentemente incapaz de concentrarse en el ahora por estar siempre pensando en el pasando y preocupandose por el futuro.--- from book's back cover"
5,La clave para una vida mejor,"Este libro llegó a mis manos en el momento preciso. Si fuera posible convencer a todos mis seres queridos de leerlo, sería ideal ya que ofrece todas las palabras que uno necesita para entender la vida en sí, a uno mismo y a todos los que compartimos este planeta."
1,Awful frisbee,This frisbee is nothing like the Hyperflite Jawz discs. I read the other reviews before purchasing and figured the other bad review was just someone who let their dog use it as a chew toy. I bought it thinking it would hold up well in cold weather/snow and be the same strength as the Hyperflite Jawz discs that we love. After 5 throws with our Lab carrying the frisbee back in his mouth it had bite marks all in it. After 10 throws it was bent almost in half and didnt fly straight anymore. After 20 throws it's cracked on one side and pretty much unusable. There's a reason it's only $5 versus the $15 that the regular Jawz discs cost on Amazon. Avoid at all costs.
3,my VCR broke,I thought they would be a good inspiration since I am 65. But it does not come in DVD and my VCR broke so I was unable to play the tape. I should go on amazon and get a new VCR I guess. So can't recommend it because never seen it.But the cover is inspirational? Those older lady's look pretty good.
5,Analogies between the natural and spiritual body,"I have enjoyed reading and re-reading this book over the last decade. As a surgeon, I can appreciate Dr. Brand's sense of wonder for the human body, and as a Christian, I appreciate the parallels Brand and Yancey have drawn between the human body and the body of Christ. I enthusiastically recommend this book (and its companion volume FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE)."
5,Excellent reading,"This is a lovely book, entertaining to read, and thought-provoking. Once you set it down, it's likely you'll wonder how anyone can believe we're an ""accident"" of the Big Bang and evolution. :)"
5,Great Book/Author,"Glad to get this book. Arrived in great shape, and gives a Doctor's perspective on how awesome our God is in how he created each and every one of us"
5,WOW this an awesome book!,"I am very rarely blown away by books. I read so many and am often underwhelmed by the writing or content...but this book is truly superb! Excellent writing and real-life stories so interesting I've found myself telling them to friends. Each chapter a history, anatomy, and spiritual lesson all in one! Dr. Brand has led a truly amazing life and he shares his wisdom with us through his very thought-provoking stories. This is the sequel to ""Fearfully and Wonderfully Made"" which is also a great read!"
3,"Not terrible, but sounds tired next to some of her brilliant earlier works","Evelyn ""Champagne"" King secured a place among disco immortals with the legendary hit ""Shame"", showed that she was still in peak form a few years later with her brilliant ""Get Loose"" album, and even had a silky, sensual hit as recently as 1988 with ""Kisses Don't Lie"". A year after that, she made this album. While it is by no means wretched, it's definitely lacking in something that made some of her previous efforts so outstanding. Her singing is certainly what someone should rightfully expect from her, but the material here just doesn't do justice for her voice the way some of her other albums do, particularly on her bland and melodically uncreative cover of the classic Isley Brothers slow jam ""Footsteps In The Dark"" which, itself, is already a heavily covered (and unfortunately, sampled) song. I have much respect for Evelyn ""Champagne"" King and am an avid collector of her albums, but this just clearly isn't her best work."
3,Come On,"""Strangelet"" hasn't grabbed me as well as past albums. Much of the set is slow & soft -- which is not always a bad thing -- but here has yet to engage me. My favorite track is ""Raise the Spirit"" with its electric dirge and the chorus ""Come on, come on."" ""Chain Lightning,"" ""Same Blue Devils"" & ""Return to Love"" were enjoyable. The rest of the CD is pleasant. I plan to get his new set ""Little Moon"" and hope it returns to form. Enjoy!"
5,Comfort Food,This is an extraordinary cd. It flows so smoothly. It may not be his best but he is in fine form here.The musicianship is extraordinary. Very good to hear when you need a pick me up. All songs stand on their own.
5,The first serious book on Indian philosophy,"I first read this book when I took an undergraduate philosophy course from Karl Popper himself way back in 1969 at the University of Minnesota. My opinion of it has never changed, and I am pleased to see that an Indian press has resurrected this seminal work: it remains, for me, the best serious evaluation of the conceptual foundations of Indian philosophy. It is a serious work by a serious philosopher, so those in search of shortcuts to nirvana should continue their search elsewhere. I lost my old copy of this book years ago, and am thrilled to have found it once again. Thanks, Amazon.com!"
4,Just like my dad described!!!,"I am related to Jan and Johan Smit. They were my great grandfather and great uncle. I have been told this story many times by my father since I was a little girl and now through the magic of VHS and DVD, I can see the movie version of what happened. It is a really wonderful story and the movie really does it justice!!"
1,Don't bother,Terribly slow plot. Very little action. No suspense. I was a bit tired when I started watching this film. It put me to sleep. Only redeeming value is seeing Peter Finch in an early role.
3,The Terror of War,"One day you have a picnic in the park, the next day your own countrymen turn against you as spys. You don't know who to trust and that comes thru in this film. I didn't particularly care for the acting or the script, and some moments seemed to drag, but the point was well made and I'm not sure of any other film that speaks to these issues.A good addition to your war film collection."
2,OK once.,"You never connect with any of the characters. You do not dislike the characters; they are just kind-of bland....like....uh...Sweden!I give 2-stars to any movie I do not keep to watch again 10-years from now.Some very unique and realistic bombing-raids are a highlight of the film.Britain sends agents to bring Amsterdam's industrial-diamonds back to Britain, and out of the hands of the approaching German-army. There are many German-sympathizers in Amsterdam. The agents do not know who to trust. This is not an espionage movie like the movie's title implies. It is a simple plot of the British-agents trying to get through the German-sympathizers mostly by avoiding them.Some shoot-outs. There is not anything strikingly bad about the film. Some things are done well. It was ok, just didn't grab me. You have to have some characters with personality for a good film. War movies with personality are: ""Where Eagles Dare"", ""The Great Escape"", ""Escape from Sobibor"", ""Wild Geese"", ""Patton""."
1,Don't buy this,"After seeing Black Book I was interested in seeing other movies about the beginning of the German invasion of Holland. I tracked this one down, but what a waste of time it was....It's very confusing when attempting to show the atmosphere in Amsterdam at this time. Hard to know the motivations of some of the characters, and in the end the only interest for me was seeing the Australian actor, Peter Finch, in an early role before he gained international stardom.Finally it's drab, and should be avoided!"
2,"Not bad, but a little disappointing","I like the idea of being the best possible version of yourself that you can possibly be, but I guess I'm not blown away by the book because this isn't the most original idea in the world and I was hoping Mr. Kelly would come through with something more than just that concept. The stories he uses (like Willie Wonka) are cute, I suppose, but at the same time they're also pretty thin. If I were facing important life decisions I wouldn't lean on Matthew Kelly to inspire me through, though I suppose he would be just fine to chat over coffee."
5,Terrific book,I'm enjoying reading this book. Matthew Kelly makes some very interesting points. I look forward to having more time to read this book.
4,The Rhythm of Life,the book was in great shape. It was advertised as NEW but when I looked through it I noticed some highlighted areas. This was ok because it was only 2 locations and the rest of the book was like new
4,great therapy,great inspirational book. Matthew Kelly is a great author. I would strongly recommend this book as a form of therapy to keep you in the right dirrection of life
4,The Rhythm of Life: Living Every Day with Passion & Purpose,"Mathew Kelly is his usual insightful, nourishing, inspiring self here. This book helps me get balanced again, gets me back on track. I like it a lot."
5,"Great, groovin' boogie music!","This CD is party-time TNT! Frontman Rockin' Robin Miller leads a tight swinging band featuring punchy horns, in-the-pocket rhythm section and gritty vocals. With an equal measure of originals and covers, this bluesy, ballsy music is the perfect tonic for the musical doldrums. As good as this CD is (and it's killer) the band blows it away live, in person. Talk about rockin' the house. Thumbs up for Millertime Boogie!"
2,"""Nikayada"" Buddhist tradition","For those who seek to follow the early teachings of the Buddha in the earliest of the suttas and those who follow the modern commentary of John Peacock and Stephen Batchelor, it is only fitting to research their shared resource, K. R. Norman. Mr. Norman, a former foremost distinguished professor of Middle Indo-Aryan or Prakrit at Cambridge, authors a most scholarly approach and commentary to the translation of the early Pali texts. With this as a starting point it becomes more apparent when later revisions or commentary by subsequent writers are added to the cannon. It is not particularly easy reading nor bed time reading; however, it is most important in understanding the later development of the Theravada Buddhist tradition of Buddhagosa in The Path of Purification (Visuddhimagga) and the Mahayana tradition of Nagajuna and Bodhidharma."
5,A glimpse into the future.,"A glimpse into the future. That is what I thought of this book. The way things are going, this is what's going to happen with the world. The wild animals won't be able to survive. I would be so sad if there weren't any animals. I hope something changes or this book could be the present instead of the future."
3,just not that great,average bridge mix. Not what I remember. The gels with the sprinkles should be tart!
1,WOW... this is bad,"I always enjoyed music older then I... until this album. Problem one is that Ted Lewis is at the end of his singing career, so his singing is slured and the beat is slowed(from the original recordings) to keep pace with him. Problem two, a reason I bought this album was to get the song ""Me and My Shadow"", and the song did not have it's own track number... instead it was at the end of a different song as a mix. A couple of the song did this as well. I thought I had found a gem... but got me colored glass."
1,Not what expected,"I specifically purchased this cd for my father-in-law who LOVES the song, Me and My Shadow. The cd shows the song is included on the playlist, yet, it was not there. In fact, the cd listed 12 songs on the back cover and there were only 10 songs on the cd. I was very disappointed."
1,Don't buy from Philips...,"I've had a terrible experience with this item. I purchased it because all other reviews were so positive, but I would not recommend it. After less than two months, some of the buttons no longer worked. Because it was still under warranty, I sent it back for a replacement. They sent me back a clock in the same series, but it was purple instead of the original silver. After calling to complain, they told me that they were out of the silver and sent what they had. Because the only technical difference was color, they would not grant my request for a refund. The aesthetics of what I purchase are just as much a factor as the features, so a cosmetic difference is just as much a difference as anything else. I am very disappointed in Philips' handling of the issue and will never buy their products again as a consequence."
1,Find Another Piece of Equipment,"This is trash in the clearest sense of the word. Philips should stick to making light bulbs and let the professionals handle audio. After about five hours of playing time, my unit developed a serious problem with its laser lens, causing the unit not to be able to read any CDs. The instruction booklet recommended that I try a CD lens cleaner, which only temporarily solved the problem. Don't be fooled. Spend your money elsewhere."
2,Not quite up to expectations,"I bought this clock radio for work and was hoping for an improvement in sound quality over my 10 year old,... Sony Dream Machine. I'm not sure I got it.The lower ranges sound good, and it has more bass than you would expect from such a small unit, but there is no upper ranges at all. At lower volumes, everything sounds muted. I wish there was at least a tone control so I could turn the treble up.I've resorted to putting a wedge underneath the radio so that it is angled towards my ears, giving me as much treble as possible, but it's still a disappointment.I'd say that it compares to the Timex clock radio/cd player that I listened to at a store. Sony has a [more expensive] radio which sounds better, but I don't like the styling."
4,No battery operation,"I bought this assuming that it would be possible to run it off of batteries for easy portability between rooms. No such luck; it runs off of the A/C power cord only. Other than that, it seems fine."
3,"If you like a green light in your room at night, you'll love this...","I gotta agree with N. Shuman (reviewer below)... this would be a perfect clock CD/stereo with the exception of one major fault - the light! UGH, it is terrible!Even though there are three light settings even on the dimmest of the three it is crazy-green bright. I now have a very bright night light shining this weird green all night long that I've had to cover with a cloth just to deal.It's a shame because otherwise this would be a great product - it is nice and compact, has good sound, lots of bells and whistles (a way to activate alarms for different days of the week, sleep mode, quiet-to-louder alarm settings, etc.). But it loses major stars - half, to be exact - because of the UFO-landing light it shines."
4,after 4 years I still don't really know what all those buttons do,"I am satistfied with this clock despite the fact I barely know how to work the damn thing. It has 20 buttons and and I have figured out what 17 of them do. That said, the clock is very reliable, it sounds fantastic and after looking at every clock radio on the market in 2006 I am totally thrilled with my 2001 purchase."
5,Also great for nurseries!,"This small unassuming box is perfect for a nursery. My daughter goes to sleep with its music every night. We do not even use the clock alarm facet, but it is a good clock for middle of the night checks."
2,Nightowl's Nightmare,"I've had this alarm for a few months now, and it's still the same thing every morning...how do you turn this damn thing off? Not exactly user-friendly. The buttons are small and they all look and feel the same in the dark. The backlit clock numbers are difficult to read. I had a similar Philips alarm...without the cd player...and it had the cool feature of being able to set the first alarm to radio and the second alarm to the annoying beeper. Great to ease yourself into the morning with some tunes, but still know when you REALLY have to get up when the beeper goes off. Too bad this one doesn't work the same. It's one or the other. Sound quality is above average, but the attention to usability factors is pathetic imho."
2,Poorly Designed,"I bought this clock because it looked good - big mistake.1. The clock LCD has a very limited display range. It sits 1 foot above eye-level next to my bed and I can't read the LCD display at all. Basically, you have to be exactly level with the clock to read the time.2. The button layout is terrible. To turn the alarm off, it is like breaking into Fort Knox. And the music alarm has a high and low setting; well the low setting is way too loud so you can't wake up to soft musicI could go on, but enough to say the design is not good."
3,"A nice little clock radio, but...","My wife and I tried this product for a few days. As an alarm clock and radio, it works as advertised, and has good audio quality. Although the radio has many buttons, their functions make sense and setting the times, volumes, and alarm modes are straightforward. The earphone jack is a nice touch. Although the tuner is an analog tuner, I had no problem getting it to hold a station once tuned. I didn't try playing a CD, so I can't comment on CD sound for this product.However, our eyesight isn't what it used to be, and we have trouble reading the legends on the buttons. Also, even with backlighting, we have trouble seeing the time numbers and alarm mode indicators. If it wasn't for this problem, we would keep this product. Those with better eyesight may be satisfied by this product. Our old clock/radio uses a vacuum-fluorescent display, which is brighter and has much more contrast than the LCD display on this product."
2,"Lot of features, but poor physical design","Highly programmable, and sound is perfectly adequate, but its control layout is baffling. Sleepy morning fingers can't navigate this thing; I have to turn on a light just to find and use the volume controls, and turn the radio on/off. Alarm clocks should be a cinch to operate with one lazy hand--nice fat volume knob, easy to find on/off, etc. Also, because the majority of buttons are on the face, you have to brace the radio with one hand and push the buttons with the other. I caved in and retired it out of frustration."
3,Controls difficult to operate,"The first one we bought stopped playing CDs and radio within three months. Philips replaced it, but we had to pay for shipping. Sound is great but I found the alarm functions hard to operate."
3,On The Fence,"I bought this product because my old alarm clock was as old as I AM! And sadly it doesnt have the life span of a human. Thus i began my search for a new and better model. I found this one, its design and feature INSTANTLY won my heart, and the reviews about how good the radio were, were not onlu encouraging but true. No radios work in my house, my cell phone doesnt even work, but this radio DOES. It picks up EVERY station my CAR radio does. the only down fall is that my bed is slightly lower then my night stand which at times makes the clock hard to see, but its choice of 3 alarm settings and weekend snooze is perfect for my crazy work and college schedule. My alarm is ready to get up and go even if my college life style begs to stay in bed"
4,How Alarming,I am very happy with my purchase. It works just perfect for my office. The only problem I had was with the alarms. They are very easy to turn on accidently and not realise you have done so.
2,Like a lighthouse in the night,"We hunted and waited all last December and January for Target to get these in, we called Philips directly and they were out of them also. Imagine our disappointment when we finally get our hands on it and the glow is so bright it lit up our entire bedroom! Great sound and features, dual alarms are great and everything was easy to set up, but the glow was unbearable, it was returned to Target."
2,Warranty? What Warranty?,"This product has excellent features, except for the lack of a battery backup. However, when the speakers stopped working just before the one-year warranty expired, I spent literally hours on the phone with their customer service outpost, being subjected to various stalling tactics before being informed, on my third call, that they just would not honor the terms of the warranty. I would buy this item (or anything from Phillips) only if you're willing to regard it as disposable."
5,"Very happy - Great Price, Great features - GENTLE WAKE RULES!!!","I've been relying upon Philips Gentle Wake technology since 1999, when I purchased their first release of itThe AJ model is an excellent update of a great line of alarm clocksAs the other reviews mention -awesome sound qualityplays any CD formatweekend sleeperdifferent sounding alarmsalarms to CD and song numbersEASY TO USEMost importantly --- the gentle wake feature is what really makes this alarm clock shineYou can throw in your favorite CD, set it to wake you up, but set it to play at an EXTREMELY low volume, as it gets increasingly louder, so that one is not SHOCKED upon being woken up by the alarm --- it is a great way to start any morningAnd for $40 this clock is a STEAL!!!Highly recommended, as all the other reviews mentionHAPPY BUYING"
2,Fuzzy Time,"I agree with the reviewer from Oklahoma, you can't see the time clearly unless you look at it straght on, a major pain in the morning when you are trying to figure how much time you really have before you get up :-). Otherwise its ok. I would look for other options."
5,Perfect says the picky reviewer,"I'm very particular about clock radios. I bought this for my desk at work, but loved it so much I put it in my Den and will soon buy two more. The radio is great. I actually prefer the 'feel' of a analog radio to a digital."
3,I Liked it a lot,Well i have bought this alarm clock twice already and am going to buy it for a third time. The CD player has broke twice on me. I love the alarm itself. So quiet no more startling realizationg of waking. It is so soft and wonderful. It sucks that after a year the CD player always goes out on me but i still love this product.
4,Not Perfect....But not bad either!,"I really like mine but I wake up and have to go directly over and look at the time cause I can not see it from a distance, even with my contacts on. You can adjust the light that it gives out, which I like. It has good cd and am/fm reception. I rather wake up too music than a buzzer but you have a choice to wake up to the radio,cd or the annoying buzzer. I found it quite easy to use and would recommend it highly."
1,Disappointing sound....neat features,"After reading glowing reviews of the sound and functions of this clock radio I was amazed to hear how bad it sounded when I got it! Really really really muffled and bass-heavy. No adjustment for tone either. Lotsa cool functions like progressive loudness alarm/radio, weekend auto-alarm-off, but it sounds SO BAD. It'll be my first return to Amazon I think!"
2,Too complicated!,"I own this product and while it has some pretty nice features in it, you'd better either have the manual handy or memorize it. It has weird controls that I have mastered after 2 years of owning this product. My wife still has no clue about how to set it up even though we've gone over it many times, and she's pretty good at these things! Nice sound, crummy antenna and as a result, often poor reception. Don't waste your money."
1,DON'T BUY THIS CLOCK RADIO,"I read previous reviews for this item and thought I'd found the perfect clock radio for my needs. It arrived--and the clock displays military time, not am/pm. I can't find the way to fix it anywhere in the instructions. So, since there was a big note from Philips enclosed with the item that said ""Need help, call us"" before you return this product, I called Philips. And I got the worst customer service I have ever received. I was told that although I purchased the clock radio five days ago, the warranty had run out--but I could purchase a new warranty for $15. Then the service rep would reveal to me how to fix the problem. I said ""no, thak you"" and returned the item. And I don't plan to buy anything from Philips in the future."
1,Designed by a roomful of monkeys,"I defy you to even attempt to use this thing without repeatedly consulting the hefty manual (and keeping it near your bedside at all times). It is the most ergonomically unfriendly, hopelessly impossible-to-use piece of electronics I have ever owned. Try to find something as simple as the on-off switch on this thing, for example!Once you get over the atrocious learning curve, you get a feature-rich, decent-sounding piece of equipment. But this is a *clock radio.* You shouldn't have to take a class in how to use a clock radio."
1,Ridiculously Complicated,"I was attracted by the styling, the brand, and the price of this CD clock radio, but that attraction faded as soon as I plugged it in and went through the setup process. There's no getting around having to read the instructions, because the buttons and the labels are not intuitive at all. If you buy this, be sure to keep the users' manual close by."
2,"Good sound, diffulcult to program, GENTLE WAKE would wake","the dead. I tried numerous times to lower the gentle wake in the high mode. The lowest volume able to program is ten which I feel is very loud. I called the Phillips tech line and was told that no other adjustments were able to be made to the volume level. The technical solution was to put a pillow over it. There are other program issues but after the ""technical"" advice I received I did not pursue the other issues. My only recourse is to put the clock in another room and purchase a new alarm clock."
2,not holding up so well,"i've had this for about a year and a half and now the cd player doesn't play reliably. the rest is okay though. display is fine, sound quality is fine, etc."
2,Need for operation manual,I have a Phillups AJ3950 alarm clock an have lost my operations manual. Where do I go to get a copy on line??
3,"""Power failure backup"" is NOT the same as battery backup","This unit has pretty good sound, and is simple to set, but it does not have battery backup. The product description says it has ""power failure backup"" but this only works for a 2 or 3 minute power outage. I find this rather misleading. I need a real battery backup that will last hours, not just minutes."
2,Only Lasted 8 Months,"We bought this clock radio in September, 2002. In early April of 2003 it just stopped working. None of the buttons would work. There was no warning, it just stopped working. This happened while the CD was playing. We had to unplug it to turn off the CD."
4,awesome,"awesome dvd. Kendra is a great work out buddy. The trainer is HOT. Great aussie accent. Makes the time fly. The moves can be challenging, but not impossible to do. Great workout. Felt it the next day!"
3,Great if you are a 90 year old woman!,"So I am a girl who loves to stay in shape and get a great workout! I saw the great reviews on Kendras workout dvd and i love kendra!! Well.... I was EXTREMELY disappointed. Sorry Kendra but this is a joke next to Jillian Michaels workouts! I bearly broke a sweat and each of the moves wasnt even done long enough to even feel the burn or your muscles working at all! This is a great workout for women 80 years older and up! I gave it 3 stars because i think Kendra is great, is a great inspiration and has done a great job losing all her baby weight. But c'mon people, lets be real, we've all seen her show and she did not do this workout to lose all that weight! (like they say she did in the workout dvd) You will probably lose some weight (not much), along with some serious dieting doing this dvd but if you are looking for a real workout to get some serious results, Jillian Michaels kicks your ass!!!"
4,"No frills, no fuss","I bought this about a month ago & I'm enjoying it. There's a bit of a cheesiness factor, but if you ever watched The Girls Next Door without getting annoyed you'll be fine. The music isn't that great, but the moves aren't complicated so you can always mute the audio & workout to your iPod. The sports drills give you a great cardio workout that's time efficient. There are 5 different segments (football, basketball, soccer, track & field, kickboxing) plus a booty workout that you can mix and match. Each segment is broken up into 30 second intervals, which makes it great for beginners. You'll work hard without over-exerting yourself (I tried Jillian Michaels & could barely function the next day). If you're at an intermediate or advanced fitness level, you won't break a sweat with this unless you do the entire workout- try P90X or something! But if you're trying to solidify a fitness routine and break into better habits, this is an enjoyable DVD."
4,Fun but annoying,"I really liked the video. I was able to keep up even though it had been while since I had worked out. I'll not really a girly type of person, but wanted to get into shape not look like a bodybuilder. The routine was easy and could complete all of the exercises within an hour. If you don't have a whole hour to workout you can pick the exercises that work best for you. There are only 2 things that I did not like about the video. You do have to keep the remote close by as at the end of each exercise it goes back to the menu and you have to select the next exercise. This isn't too bad, as you can grab a sip of water during this time. And the second thing, Kendra's trainer just kept talking about how great Kendra was. She is his favorite celebrity and he repeats it several times over the course of the video. For the most part the video is fun and I really like doing it and have already seen results."
4,Fun Video,"I was trying to lose some post baby weight when I came across this product. The video is kind of low budget, but the cardio work is a lot of fun to do!"
4,Surprisingly good,"I didn't expect much from this, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's a great, low impact, cardio workout. Kendra is her usual goofy self. I didn't mind the banter between she and her trainer b/c it made the time go by fast. I especially liked the option to customize your own workout by selecting the segments in the order you prefer (I arrange them from easiest to hardest)."
5,AWESOME & INTENSE WORKOUT!,"Kendra says in the video, I'm going to help you kick your own ass, and that's exactly what she does. I felt like I was getting results immediately. The different agility moves she uses are a lot of fun and they bring me back to my days of playing sports. If you don't like the order she uses, you can customize it to the order you like. All around I think it's great! Some might compare it to the ""insanity"" workout, I believe it has similarities, but it is probably a little easier, but you can make it as intense as you want, that's what's so great about it! Definitely LOVE IT!!"
5,Glow like gemstones!!!,"This is a great model kit! The instructions and pieces are the same as the opaque version. Bandai has used high quality plastics for the clear versions, so that when assembled and placed in front of a light source, the Gundams glow like they are lit from within.The pieces were as carefully molded as the opaque versions are, so there are no ugly ripples to mar these beautiful models. I highly recommend getting both sets (the other set is the Strike Freedom vs. Legend).Be careful if you sand/file down the tree joints as it will be more noticeable on these. I recommend using a small amount of brush-on clear coat to cover them up."
1,Don't waste your money!,"These shoes are horrible, There is absolutely no Way that these fit anyone over the age of 1. They are very very narrow and aren't made out of good material - it frays."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!,"I should have paid closer attention. The bottle says 90 softgels and now, only a week later, we are down to 31 softgels. My kid only takes two a day. The math just does not add up. So if you do order--make sure you don't get ripped off like we did!!!"
4,Latoya 1,"This album is one of the Hottest underground albums that I've heard in a long time. The production was ""Off The Hook"" and the lyrics were without a doubt the best that I've heard from a Memphis Record label. The two Female Emcees will hit the industry by storm if heard by the right person......."
4,Good metal collection from a good label,"I have been following relapse records band's since neurosis signed with them in the mid 90's. This label has consistently been a bridgeway for many great bands such as Neurosis, Mastadon, Today is The Day, Dillinger Escape Plan, and Brutal Truth amongst a few. Other bands like Amorphis and ATP are on here as well. This dvd is a lot of material circa 1995-96 era including two videos by Neurosis (worth the low price in and of itself to me). Many of the videos are live performance, or very cheesy home made type (parents basement, family farm), but that's what makes them entertaining. Production value is minimal, because these bands just want to get their music out and heard. Around 60 minutes in lenght, worth a look. I am happy relapse put recollection 1 and 2 out, and hope that they may dig through their vaults some more and release futher videos."
4,Awesome lens for the price,"I am on a budget, yet love to photograph wildlife... usually this requires a lens that will reach a good distance. The clarity is surprisingly good and the focus from 28mm to 300mm makes this a very versatile lens -- the only one you will need to carry. I would caution to use either a tripod or monopod (I use both) when shooting at 200mm and above unless your hand is incredibly steady. I've owned Sigmas before and will buy again -- the Canon lenses are just to pricey for me."
3,Great range but slow focusing and too soft at the long end,"The 28-300mm (45-480mm on a 30d) has a great range and would have made a good all purpose walk around lens. However, because of it's speed f/3.5-6.3 it was slow to focus and in low light there were times it could not focus at all. Also, while quite sharp on the short end, it lost its sharpness over 200mm. When using in bright sun with dark shadows it was difficult to get a proper exposure. Other lenses I have used did not suffer this problem. Returned and purchased a Canon 70-200mm f/4 which I would give 5 stars."
5,Canon xti,"I recently purchased a Sigma camera lens for my Canon xti. 28-300mmI took a trip to Lopez Island last week and cannot express the joy I have gotten with the pictures I took on the trip. Just wonderful!!!!!!!!!Sincerely,Priscilla"
1,There is no such thing as a good lens for the money!,"I think a lens is either good or it's not - this one is not! I bought it as a way to travel light on a vacation, but didn't have a dozen keepers out of the whole lot. I realize that you have to make some concessions when choosing a lens at this price point with such a large focal range, but this one required way more concessions than I was willing to make. Amazon allowed me to return it (thanks, Amazon!)."
1,"Low quality, Poor construction","I ordered this lens to go with my Canon XSi. The lens didn't hold it's position (every time you moved the camera, the zoom of the lens would change) so the result was blurry photos. Even when the photos were in focus, they just lacked a certain...something. Do yourself a favor and go for the Canon branded lenses."
4,Great lens for the money,I'm just a mom with a really nice camera (the Canon digital rebel) and this lens was a great birthday present from my husband. It has so spoiled me with the zoom! I recomend this for any amatuer - intermediate photographer. Go For It!
4,Great lens!,"Great product. Good value. Maybe a little slow for focusing, compared to my old 18-55mm Canon lens. Good quality pictures. Great all in one lens!"
2,Slow focusing; not sharp; dissapointed,"I bought this lens in May for my brand new Rebel XT. I used it on a vacation mainly, and am pretty dissapointed. I'm no pro, or even skilled amateur, but I do know the lens is not giving me quality shots.The autofocusing is slow, and af or manual shots aren't very sharp at any zoom. There seems to be a fingerprint on one of the inner lenses that indicates poor quality control to me.I wanted a good, all around lens before building a real lens collection of different types. I guess this would fit the bill, if it took sharp pictures. I wouldn't pay more than $150 for this lens again."
3,"Good zoom lens, poor build quality","I had this lens for a few months. It took some nice pictures. It's not very sharp but it's a great walk around lens because of its range and price. The build quality is poor. When a screw inside broke, it wouldn't zoom out anymore when rotated. I think it's would be alright if you're very careful with it and rotate the zoom slowly."
4,great lens for the price,"I have been using it for a month. It works great. Even at 300 zoom, I could take pictures without shake outside without a tripod. I take atleast 2 shots to make sure the focusing is perfect. Cant beat this lens for the price. I am very pleased"
5,Nice,"This book has no verse or chapter separation for convenient referencing aside from basically Prologue, Book One and Book Two, that would have been nice, but oh well.In Book One Gregory gives what is basically a recapitulation of historical material on Moses already clearly available in the Torah. It is in Book Two where The Life of Moses comes to really perform, Book One is basically a setup for Book Two. Book Two is much longer than Book One and contains some fascinating reflections on Moses.One criticism of Gregory I wish to give is on page 51 he betrays a weakness in his worldview, one that Augustine did not share, in saying concerning the hardening of Pharaoh ""For if this were to be willed by the divine nature, then certainly any human choice would fall into line in every case, so that no distinction between virtue and vice in life could be observed."" Here he betrays either an ignorance of Romans 9 or its correct interpretation and application."
4,What to strive for!,"The Life of Moses is two books in one. The first one deals with the history of Moses. The second takes accounts from this history and explains their meaning. Gregory not only demystifies Moses' lifeby explaining the symbolic meaning of it's events(""The master of deciet endeavors to turn the drink of the Hebrews into blood by polluting it with falsehood"",page 69), he also encourages the reader to apply the beliefs to his/her own life(""The firmer and more immovable one remains in the good, the more he progresses in the course of virtue"",page 117). He even explains why God resides in the heavens(""The divine is by it's very nature infinite, enclosed by no boundry"", page 236). This is a very good book for anyone in the Judeo-Christian community, but need not be limited to that group alone. It is thought provoking enough to appeal to theologians, and the heavy use of metaphor reminded me of some of the writings from eastern religions."
5,Balls a plenty,"Joey Goebel is a unique human being in a world too full of [dung] eaters. His book is different from the other novels cramed on the shelves at the bookstore. It is this difference that restores my faith in the American book buisness. God bless Joey, the fine state of Kentucky, and all the beautiful female groupies who follow young Joey everywhere he goes."
3,"Wasn't all that ""punk rock.""","Maybe I'm too old now. Maybe I forgot what it's like having the mindset of a 22-year old. Or maybe I do remember and now that I'm 36, it all seems so silly? I liked the book. I liked the flow of it -- it was a very easy read with obvious cultural understatements from the perspective of a younger adult. The characters were well-developed and interesting. But it wasn't a great book. It was merely a good book. And yes, I realize this is a satire, but there are most interesting ways in writing satire that is more tongue-in-cheek and less listing of stereotypes.Based on the book reviews, I was expecting to find a new author to love, one who I would want to buy every book he has written. But alas, it was just....good...and I'm not sure I will try another book.A+ for character development; C for story; B for creativity."
3,good start but needs improvement,"This book is definitely a great debut novel, especially from a writer so young. As another Henderson native, I'm proud to see Joey do well.Joey definitely has a gift with words and can create vivid scenes and characters. However, these reviews are so over the top, it's a joke. In terms of theme, this book could use some real work. When you get right down to it, this is adolescent, misanthropic angst at its worst, namely arrogant and myopic. In that regard, the local paper was dead on. Humanoids? Give me a break. How many demeaning caricatures can you cram into one book? I don't find this book at all empowering or inspiring, as some other reviewers have suggested. Is it entertaining? Yes. Would I recommend it? Yes, with some reservations. Did I have higher expectations? Sadly, yes.Joey, you're very talented- keep up the good work. I look forward to watching you develop as a writer. Maybe getting out of Kentucky for a while would be good for both you and your craft."
5,More than expected...,"I purchased this album because I heard my uncle play ""Nola"" when I was a child visiting the grandparents. I expected the other cuts to be similar in style and period. I was very surprised when I heard Ms. Keller begin to sing on track two, ""That's a Plenty"". I thought, ""Oh, no, she's going to sing??"" But I was very pleasantly surprised by her consummate styling; the vibrato and delivery reminiscent of the best Dixieland vocalists, carried off in a throaty mezzo. She sings on four of the cuts, with plenty of good ragtime piano numbers in-between."
2,Not for everyone,"This book is not for everyone. It has reciepes that include ingredients not available in alot of smaller towns. The authors say ""visit your local Italian del"" that don't exist everywhere. Some of the ingredients I'v never heard of. It's more of a gormet cookbook."
3,"Lots of recipes, No pictures","The book is much bigger than I thought it would be. Many recipes are crammed on the pages. I prefer cookbooks with pictures and with only one recipe per page. I like that the recipes are not a variation of the norm. Until I purchase a crockpot that can be programmed for a specific number of hours, I will not be able to try many of the recipes because they are for less than the 8-10 hours that I can program my current crockpot."
3,Didn't love it,Found the recipes to have too many ingredients and be somewhat overly involved. And they weren't that tasty either. Not a great cookbook for a busy mom.
4,A decent cookbook,"Ths is a decent cookbook. Usually I adapt recipes I already have for the crockpot. This book takes a new look at what a crockpot can do and several of the dishes I have tried are excellent. (See Roast Pork with Apples.) I have found that I use this cookbook quite a bit, especially for new ideas if not necessarily the exact recipe offered."
1,NOT A FAN OF NOT YOUR MOTHER'S SLOW COOKER COOK BOOK!!!!,"This book is sloppy. There are over 350 recipes presented higgeldy piggeldy throughout...no pictures and many recipes start three quarters of the way through one page and extend to the next. Not only are you flipping from one page to the next, but you may read through a recipe a dozen times until you realize the authors have neglected to tell you what to do with those mushrooms you sliced 1/2 inch thick (as in Slow cooker lemon chicken page 285). They obviously rushed through the publication of this book and decided to forego the details in favor of jumping on the slow cooking bandwagon. While there are some great recipes, the book is too unweildy and too poorly laid out to find them. Try another slow cooker book!"
5,Sophisticated and Savvy,"I got this cookbook for a friend who is a real ""crockpot"" afficianado. She loved it for its great variety (not just recipes for spaghetti sauce or stew). For example, the first recipe she tried was jambalaya. I own a slew of Beth Hensperger bread cookbooks, so I knew this cookbook would be a winner."
2,Not for the simple or basic cook,I think if you're a bit more experienced chef or looking for complicated and perhaps more elaborate recipes then this book would be suited for you. I was hoping it would include some quick and easy ideas. I'm probably going to trade mine if anyone is interested :-)
2,"If you like bland food, then this book is for you","Sorry, but not a fan at all. I've followed the recipes to the 't' in this book and they are all tasteless and very bland. The latest recipe I just tried making was the shrimp and chicken jambalaya. It's HORRIBLE. There wasn't enough liquid so it dried out and there was NO flavor.If you are looking for a great cookbook, save your money and buy something different.I agree with the title. This is NOT *my* mother's slow cooker cookbook. She could cook much better."
3,Need Mother's Slow Cooker Cookbook,"The recipes in the book are good, but it was not what I was looking for. It turns out that I need my mother's slow cooker cookbook. I guess I was looking for more simplified and everyday recipes. I doubt that I'll use many of the recipes in this book. I'm sure they are great, but not to my taste."
4,Lots of great recipes,This is a great cookbook for someone just getting started with a slow cooker. It has lots of tasty ideas. Sometimes the ingredient lists can be quite extensive but every recipe I've tried from this so far has turned out good.
2,where's the salt,I have made several things from this book and most resulting in mediocre or less results. I finally realized that some of the recipes are completely void of salt and pepper. not even season to taste. ok book for learning technique but use your instinct in the actual cooking.
4,"Good reference for slow cooking, better for meat dishes","I've owned this cook book for a number of years and it is worth owning. The sloppy joe recipe in this book is excellent! It is true (what the other review said) that many of the recipes require preparation time but it is worth it.For me, a couple of the recipes were overcooked at the end of the cook time. I doubled a recipe for a medium cooker for my large cooker, but it was a little burnt in the end (without adding the additional time they recommend when increasing sizes). It is because of this that I give this cookbook 4 stars instead of 5.This is a meat focused cookbook with only a couple chapters that have vegitarian dishes. The bean recipes usually call for you to pre-cook the beans, which means it can take almost two days to make the dish."
3,maybe not my cookbook either,"The book is long on complex recipes and short on basic recipes. It's also not as good as I'd like with defining the size of the slow cooker that is appropriate for the recipes. The variety of recipes is great. Instructions are clear, and layout is appealing. The book includes recipes for all meals and lots of occasions. As a new slow cooker owner I just need something more basic to get started."
1,Recipe has ruined two slow cookers!,"I realize there are many positive reviews for this cookbook, however, I feel compelled to write my first Amazon review after ruining two slow cookers with the pizza sauce recipe included in the book. The recipe calls for cooking 10-14 hours on low and I woke up to find a burnt mess which I was unable to clean off and removed some of the ceramic glaze of the pot in the process. I bought a new slow cooker to replace my ruined one and tried the recipe again, with half the cooking time and with 3x the amount of water the recipe called for, just to be safe. Again, I awoke to another burnt mess, although it was not as bad as the first time. There is a burnt rim of sauce around the pot that I am having a difficult time removing. I'm mad at myself for trying this recipe again and am reluctant to try any other recipes after my experiences. Pizza sauce shouldn't be this destructive and I'm not prepared to replace another slow cooker!"
3,Good as a resource but you'll grow beyond it quickly,"I like cookbooks that explain how to do the basics well, how to make the most of leftovers and how to substitute ingredients when my cupboard is bare.More often than not, these cookbooks inject a bunch of specialty ingredients I wouldn't normally stock or couldn't find at a local supermarket if my life depended on it.This book is a fair resource for beginners. Consider it a starting point. You'll develop your own stable of recipes and probably ignore the other 80% of the recipes in this book. That doesn't mean this isn't worth purchasing though, especially if you haven't used a slow cooker before."
2,Hit or Miss,Some of the recipes in this book are fantastic. Others are not good and definitely will not be made again. It is definitely not a cookbook that you can open to any page and make a recipe with confidence that it will look and taste good.
3,Good recipes but poor directions,"What I like about this recipe book is that unlike other slow cooker cookbooks, this one doesn't rely on a lot of processed foods. However, three of the recipes were completely off in cooking times and ruined the meal."
4,Worth it for the breakfast recipes alone!,"I received this as a gift, and have used it a LOT for the breakfast recipes. I love being able to make very healthy, inexpensive and hearty breakfasts in my slow cooker overnight."
3,"Worthwhile, but lacking in zest","I would recommend this book to those cooks who wish to prepare meals w/o canned soups and convenience products, and who cook for people who don't want a lot of seasoning. When I decided to revisit slow cooking, I bought a 6.5 qt. programmable slow cooker and this book based upon the Amazon reviews. Given my results in the last two months, I would recommend this book primarily for the ""standard American"" slow cooker dishes such as soups, stews, and pot roasts. While nothing exiciting, they are tasty enough. The recipes for more ethnic dishes, such as Chicken Curry and Moroccan Chicken Thighs with Chickpeas and Cumin, have been disappointing: while I wasn't expecting them to taste ""authentic,"" I did expect them to be seasoned better. Uniformly, the recipes in this book are fairly bland. Still, I'm glad I bought the slow cooker and this book."
3,recipes for the E. and W. coast of US,"Take a XX oz. can of this (no gramme conversions, no explanation of exotic products or poss. subsistutions), add some sort of bizarre product (even if I compared the Italian name to find the French, I would have a hard time getting equivalent here in Paris!)and....Limited and not really anything new or that I don't already do the old-fashioned way: result...no time saver, just recipe ideas (not really needing slow cooker).Had hoped for something more original and practical for slow cooker use."
2,Is ketchup a recipe ingredient to you?,"Your answer to the question will determine whether you like this book. I almost purchased this book, and then found it at the library to look at first. I found 4 recipes that I would consider making. One recipe (but not one of the 4) listed ketchup as a recipe ingredient, and others listed similar prepared processed sauces likely to have lots of sugar. Its probably fine for someone using the crock pot to save time and bother - but I like to know the ingredients, and ketchup doesn't cut it for me."
3,Not for Me,"Nice book...but the recipes are way too funky for me. I'll hang onto it until I think of an urban Yuppie I can ""gift"" it to."
5,Yummy!!,"One of my favorite cookbooks, it even helped me make some the best pot roast my family has ever had. I gave my sisters copies for Christmas, here's to hoping they have asmuch success with this book as I have had!"
2,Disappointed in recipe quality,"I had high hopes for this cookbook, but was not at all pleased when I actually cooked from it. Again and again, I found recipes tasteless, strangely cooked (chicken in particular, which is difficult to do in a slow cooker), and just really disappointing. I eventually gave it away."
4,JG,I like the book and have used the recipes several times already and really like it. The only thing I miss are the pictures.
2,Poorly Formatted Kindle Version - Not Worth Purchasing,I was excited to purchase this book for my Kindle but was very disappointed by the poor formatting. The ingredient lists are often very small and even increasing the font size does not help. In the end I returned the book because of the formatting issues.My suggestion is that the publisher review the entire book and correct the issues. There is no excuse for selling Kindle users a lower quality product than is available to print buyers.
4,Just what I was looking for,"I am not new to cooking and have a wealth of cookbooks new and old in my home. But I was lacking a good slow cooker cookbook that would allow me to make delicious dishes but not have to watch the stove like a hawk - I mostly use the slow cooker so that when I have guests I am not tethered to the stove.In any case, I had read about this book and checked it out in the bookstore. It seemed to be just what I was looking for. It has a lot of great recipes for some dishes that you know and others that you would love to try. The Confetti Seaford Chowder drew RAVES from my extended family when I served it recently and the Beer Chicken was pretty good too.I give it four stars for two reasons - I wish it had more recipes for chicken and beef and I wish it had some pictures. I love pictures."
4,"Thorough directions, wide range of recipes","This really is not a cookbook for a beginner cook. Even though the directions are very thorough, I think a beginning cook would be put off by the explicit directions. The recipes are not just ""dump and cook."" The wide range of recipes is excellent. They take you beyond the regular pot roast recipes and into a wide range of recipes from ""everyday"" to ""gourmet."" Very interesting cookbook. Will be well used."
1,Ick!,"With a family of eight I am always looking for new recipes. I would consider myself a very experienced cook/baker. I have even made several wedding cakes from scratch (no cake mixes here!) for between 200 and 350 people. I surely can use a slow cooker. I tried the macaroni and cheese recipe in this book and it was horrible. The instructions said to add uncooked pasta. I read the recipe several times... uncooked pasta? Seemed like a bad idea at the time and it was a bad idea. A starchy, gooey, nearly inedible mess was what we ended up with.Have the authors ever eaten real homemade mac and cheese? If so, they would know better!! Ended up with cereal for dinner and the chickens ended up with a big pot of curdled starch. At least the chickens will love it!"
2,not your mothers slow cocker cockbood,"no family friendly. Can not find items in this small town to make a lot of recipes. Maybe if you live in a large city with more than walmart, that's the only store we have. The other store is a mexican store."
3,A Little Disappointed,"My husband and I agree this book is lacking in the recipe department. There are lots of good tips, but not enough ""normal"" cooking recipes to rate it above average. How about a plain ol' pork sholder? Nope."
2,Lacking a lot,"While this cookbook has some interesting recipes, it is really lacking on the nutritional information of the recipes. Calories per serving, fat grams, fiber, nothing... Dieters beware."
2,Not worth the money,I bought this thinking I would like it and I didn't find anything in it worth cooking....
3,Too critical?,"This book is very comprehensive covering just about everything a person needs to know to use a slow cooker to it's fullest. I just wish it had some illustrations of the completed dishes. Also, the soft cover version is very difficult to use since it does not stay open to the desired recipe."
2,Bland and overcooked,"I was looking forward to using this cookbook as the idea of preparing dinner early in the day and having it ready and waiting for me at six o'clock was extremely appealing. However, I have been extremely disappointed. All the entrees I have tried have been, in my opinion, overcooked. Sadly, I am coming to the conclusion that most foods were not meant to be cooked 6-7 hours. Most of the recipes I tried were a bland mushy mess and there is not one that I would subject my family to again. My last and final attempt was the Chicken with Beer which was both dry (due to the required baking for 20 minutes in the oven after 3 to 4 hours in the slow cooker on high) and tasteless. Much to my amazement, one prior reviewer actually liked this recipe! So maybe its just me. In any case I am considering givin the slow cooker to Goodwill, along with this cookbook. There has got to be a better way to simplify the chaos of dinner time preparation."
2,Good ideas; bad execution,"I appreciate this book for getting me using a slow cooker for the first time and giving me a lot of ideas. A few recipes have become regulars in our kitchen. A number of recipes are poorly conceived and executed, such as the mac and cheese or really any of the pasta recipes.BE AWARE: EVERY SINGLE RECIPE that I've tried from this book has twice the amount of liquid required. I have had to ladle out and reduce on the stove, ladle out and separately cook with more rice, etc., add tomato paste, throw away liquid, etc., etc. from nearly every recipe. Just start by using half the liquid for any recipe. If it says to ""add stock"" and the pot already seems to have a fair amount of liquid, then DON""T ADD IT. I feel as though either the authors have a leaky slow cooker or they haven't really tested these recipes."
3,"Okay for a beginner, but not great","Since I'm new to slow cooking, I was interested in this book. The recipes are fairly run of the mill. I'm not new to cooking and I've seen a lot of these recipes before, or at least recipes that are a lot like them. For me, the real interest is in (a) how to convert to slow cooking and (b) new recipes that taste better when done in a slow cooker and/or cannot be made any other way.The chicken with lime and cilantro was overcooked and tasted of neither lime nor cilantro. It was okay, not fantastic. This is a recipe I tried more than once and cannot get it to work. The time for rice cooking seems to be overly long. The times for cooking beans are correct or seem to be."
4,"Recipes require some planning, but there's a payoff!","I've found that I don't always have the ingredients on hand. But we've enjoyed every recipe that I've tried. The Thai Pork is excellent as is the Penne and Tuna (I substitued canned salmon, or chicken and broccoli). I too was tired of canned soup and meat in a crockpot. So far, the recipes in this book have inspired me to use my crockpot more frequently. I like it so much that I've given it as a gift."
2,Test Kitchen is better.,"These recipes don't pay off. They are very involved and the finished product (usually) isn't worth the work it took to create it.America's Test Kitchen slow-cooker recipes are also involved, but they are all truly excellent. I've made *every* slow cooker recipe in America's test kitchen more than once and they are all tasty.If you want quick recipes, find a different book.If you want delicious recipes, go with this: The America's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook 3rd Edition.[Edit: I've now made 20 recipes and 2 were good, 1 was okay, and 17 were awful.]"
1,Save the money,Sorry I have had this book for overand year and tried about 10 recipes in all. None of them were good and some barely edible. You will waste a ton of money on this one.
1,Disappointed,"I have her Rice-Cooker cookbook and really like it but this one was a disappointment.I tried the potato soup recipe. How could a potato soup be bad? It was.Gloppy thick, no flavor. After going through the book and scrutinizing the recipes a bit more, others didn't seem like they'd be much better so I had to send this book back."
3,Not Always Accurate Recipes...,"While I appreciate the author's use of healthy ingredients, many of the recipes did not turn out as described or expected when I tried them at home in my crockpot. For example, there are many recipes for oatmeal, & I was excited to try them. I tried one and it was a gloppy, disgusting mess! Maybe it's my crockpot or maybe it's the book...you decide!"
3,not too practical,"I found that many of the the recipes were not too practical for my area in terms of the kinds of food that are required for the recipes. Living in a rather remote part of the state, the stores here do not have a really large selection of things to choose from."
2,No pictures of the recipes.,I wish the look inside was from the middle of the book. I would not have purchased it had I known there were no pictures to show what the recipes are supposed to look like. I hate cookbooks like this. It's always a surprise at what your meal will come out like... I'm new to crockpot cooking and I thought I was going to get to see some exciting recipes. Instead I have to hope I'm getting it right.
5,Great Cookbook !!,"Lots of wonderful recipes for the crockpot. Lots of great ideas that you wouldn't normally think about. The first section about how to properly use a crockpot is worth the price of the book alone. Very informative, and saved me lots of grief. Now I know how to cook with a crockpot with lots of confidence. It's like taking an in depth college course on how to use a crockot.Wonderful book, I highly recommend it."
4,The best cookbook for slow cooking,"I bought this cookbook after several friends told me it was the best cookbook for slow cooking. Boy, were they right. I had been scouring the internet for recipes for my new slowcooker and finding that most called for simply pouring lots of canned ingredients in there and walking away. Yuck! This cookbook appealed to me right away because it calls for mainly fresh ingredients and features contemporary recipes from a variety of regions. The result is slow cooking perfection-- recipes that are simple to make, but don't rely too much on processed ingredients, and taste fantastic. My favorite recipes so far include the White Bean Soup with Bacon and the Thai Pork. Delicious! I highly recommend this cookbook."
5,Great recipes,"I got this book in tandem with my new slow cooker, and I have to say it's been great. The recipes are creative and everything I've tried to make has turned out perfectly. Try the Italian sausage and bell peppers recipe. Delish!"
4,Perfect Companion to your new slow cooker,"I got a new slow cooker and wasn't sure what to do with it. A friend (who happens to be a good cook) recommended this book . It's got a great introduction section to explain how to use a slow cooker. So far every recipe I've tried has been very good, very easy. The very best so far is the Thai Pork with Peanut Sauce and it couldn't be any easier. Watch the cook times though - my cooker gets too hot so I have to cut the cooktimes by a couple of hours."
4,Perfect for the beginner studying the Tarot.,"I absolutely adore Ms Morrison's writing and books, so I was very excited when I finally ordered this and got it in the mail. I was never very familiar with the Tarot before I read this, and after reading this, I feel that I have a much greater grasp of it. Her writing style is to the point and friendly without being too aggressively-friendly, which makes it easy to follow and charming to read. Her meditations with each card are treasured, and the spells are varied and simple to use. She also gives personal stories about her experiences with the Tarot, which help the reader (especially the beginner) to relieve any fears or doubts that they might have. Although it isn't the ""most definitive"" text on the Tarot out there, it is certainly one not to be missed."
2,why destroy your cards?,"I read her books and they are okay. As a tarot reader for many years. Her history and information about tarot is great BUT some of the spells she uses will make any deck or photocopies of the deck useless after doing these spells. Burn them, write magic marker on them flush in the toilet huh ? Why the cards are beautiful works of art and we spend time picking decks for us to use and collect why do this to them? this book was kind of disturbing. Never in my life would I ever destroy or deface my cards in that manner, if you love tarot cards, you wouldn't do this to them. I recommend Tarot Spells by Janina Renee. at least she doesn't tell me to flush, burn or deface them."
3,Brake Rotors,"The ""Brembo"" brake rotors I received for my '84 Chevy K10 truck were manufactued by two different suppliers. Although they were identical in physical appearance they carried markings on each that were different, one made in Canada (Good) the other with no markings (probably China, Tiawan crap). For this reason, I was somewhat disappointed with the ""Brembo"" rotors."
5,Estranged,"This video tells you everything you want to know about the song and music video of Estranged. There are lots of interviews with the members of Guns N' Roses, and they provide more of an understanding of what the song is about and what Axl was going through when he wrote it. It shows how each part of the video was filmed, how they did it, etc. I thought it was amazing how, in one music video, Axl could express so much feeling and clearly show his self-destruction. Overall, this video is EXCELLENT."
5,Maybe the absolute greatest GnR video,"This is a great, great video. For the most awesome song. I searched for this video when it first came out, asking the record/video store every week of they got it in. I practically wore it out the first week or two. Had to get another! The making of doc. is very cool. Gives you some insight into what Axl was thinking, etc... There is only one problem I have with this video - the title. Can anyone tell me why noone at Geffen, or GnR or heck, anyone who put this thing together, didn't realize that IV (as in part IV) means 4? And how can there be part 4 of a TRILOGY? Trilogy is three, count them, three parts. Sorry, I just don't understand. If it was a mistake, you'd think someone, somewhere would have caught it. And if it is part 4, where the heck is part 3??? Or am I missing something? Anyway get this video. Get all three of the trilogy: Don't Cry-part 1, November Rain-part 2, and Estranged-part 4 (actually part 3). Greatest set of videos ever."
5,Inspiring,"""I am the Father's Son"" flows like water. I finished it in a matter of hours and felt as if I had spent that time chatting with a best friend. Ray's friendly and refreshing writing was once again amplified in this moving autobiography.Through the poignant account of Ray's life journey, I now have a better understanding of Spiritualism. Being a practicing Lutheran myself and new to the metaphysical, I realized through this book that Spiritualism is very much misunderstood. ""I am the Father's Son"" will ignite your faith, no matter the religion in which you practice.Well written and very engaging! Don't miss out on this one!"
5,Oceanus offers a great watch!,This watch was just what I was looking for. It is self-adjusting with the atomic clock in Colorado and very easy to read. I think it looks great. It is a very functional watch. I am very pleased.
2,not satisfied,"Although I use this product, I am not satisfied with the quality and the shape -- It's not brief cut. it's a high cut.I've been using a different brand (which I got from my mom) which I really loved and I was looking for a similar one but this is not the one."
4,A very good book,"Fantastic, emotional ending, excellent story of two friends who connect through their love for horses. Descriptive of the war fields."
3,Are they gay?You decide.,"I didn't read this book out of my own free will. Unfortunately I had to read it for my leaving cert examination as it is one of the texts on my course. One of the reasons the book was chosen was because of it's brevity. The story itself is a very simple one. Alex trys to break the social,political and religious barriers by forging a relationship with Jerry, a Catholic boy on the opposite side of the great divide. Much of the book concentrates on the suspicious antics of the two and leads to some serious questions about their sexuality(Once they go swimming naked together). The second part of the book is set in the fields of Flanders during the First World War. This is were the book begins to get interesting. The sheer veracity with which she portrays the horrors of war is a great feature of her writing. For those who haven't read the book yet, I will not spoil it by telling you what happens in the end."
5,Peter Catalanotto's Art,"Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, the talent illustrator's best work to date, with an outstanding story. Faced with an art competition, Emily learns how seeing the world through your own eyes is better than any prize. My pick for the Caldecott award!!! Get it while it's still in first printing!"
3,Emily's Art a Wonder of Color,There's a girl named Emily. She has a friend that loves her art. In the story there is an art contest. Will she win the contest? My name is Nisa when I read this I coudn't look away! I like this book because I really love art!
3,disappointed in author,"I was pleased that Ms. Cobb published an historical fictional novel, but embarassed and disappointed that she views long held African beliefs as ""supernatural."" Such thinking is an insult to all people of African descent, including Ms. Cobb's very own ancestors. African spirituality and ""religion"" is not founded in the supernatural. In the very least, it is founded on animism. It's a shame that a writer would ignore contextual documents and research about African ""religions"" given that her novel is historical fiction."
2,"Horrible editing, poorly researched","In full disclosure, I don't own this book, nor have I given it a thorough read-through. However, it is easy for anyone vaguely familiar with UC Davis that there is a lot to be desired in this book. For example, the Athletics section notes that UC Davis is in the Pac-10 Conference, while UC Davis has never been, nor has any plans to join the Pac-10 (incongruously, the correct conference affiliations of UC Davis athletic teams are stated elsewhere in the same chapter). Another example: the book recommends taking a walk in the ""arboredum [sic]"" rather than correctly spelling it arboretum.I wouldn't recommend using this book to make an important college decision. It may serve as a supplement to actually visiting the campus and talking with the admissions office, alumni, or current students, but I would not use it as a total replacement for those tactics."
5,THE GREATEST BAND EVER,Toad is by far tops on my list of favorite bands. From Bread and Circus to coil and in between they never stoped bringing the best they could offer. I only wish they were still around! A toast to Toad. CHEERS!
5,Great CD,Every song on this CD is awesome. I listen to it & become awe-struck & unable to speak. Buy this CD.
5,"Actually, how about rating this with ten stars...","WELL DONE! If you have ears you need this cd. If you are even just a remote Toad fan you need this cd. This is a great collection and it highlights the absolute best of this cool band. I was introduced to Toad back in the late 80's with Pale and followed from there. Toad has always put some some great, overlooked work and when you put the best tracks from the past cd's, you get a collection that everyone should own.."
5,good things are hard to find,"Each time I listen to this CD, I ask myself ""Why have so few people heard about these guys?"" Their music is by far better than most alternative or folk music I have heard. And as good as this compilation is, it does not do justice to the full sound and spectrum of Toadness. How about Rings from 'Coil'? That song is so darn good it give me goosebumps just thinking about it. Thankfully Toad made it to South Africa with 'Fear' or I would not have been blessed with the sound of this truly gifted group.Boy, I tell ya, it's as if their existence was like a shooting star - short glimpse and gone."
5,This is one Sprocket you don't want to miss.,"I love this CD. It has a little bit of everything from here to there. If you love Toad, you definitely don't want leave this one out of your collection."
4,Massive,This CD holds a treasure trove of massively nostalgic tracks. I think Toad were guilty for many of those great hits we heard on radio but never quite knew who sang them.Of particular sepia-toned effect was the track 5 Good Intentions.
2,This is for the DVD version only.,"**THIS IS FOR THE DVD VERSION ONLY**To real fans, a dissapointment. To other fans not so good. There are no extras on this DVD, in other words, a barebones DVD. This DVD DOES have the original Theatrical Trailer, and English, Spanish, and French subtitles. This DVD only comes in widescreen."
5,Hyacinth's hots just keep on coming!,"Yet another 'Keeping up appearances' gem to add to my library. Three classic episodes, Violets country cottage, Driving Mrs. Fortescue, Country estate sale. You've heard about Hyacinth's sister with ""room for a pony"", now you get to see Violet's estate when Hyacinth borrows her house for an indoor/outdoor BBQ. This is one of my all time favorite episodes and I was so happy to find it in this collection.Driving Mrs. Fortescue shows the only scenes of Hyacinth in a pub! Not the kind of place one would expect to be found when you are active in higher social circles.The County estate episode was not one of my favorite episodes until I happened to watch it a few more times on this tape and I began to notice discreet incidences which had me in tears of laughter.If you are a Keeping up appearances fan, this tape is a must for your collection."
3,Good theory;too opinionated &weak scholarship,"This was an interesting theory on the fight and it is plausible. It falls short because the author uses secondary sources, not original for his documentation. Also, he should have edited out the hyperbole in his descriptions of the participants. it would have been a better read, as well as better scholarship, if he had toned down his persons biases and let the reader form his own opinion. At the very least, he should have separated ""facts"" from his opinion."
5,Nicky does it again..,"Andre Nickatina formerly known as Dre Dog is hands down the best rapper from San Fransisco. A reformed (well not really) coke dealer and an underground legend, Nicky keeps it real as hell with his raps and with his fans when he's on tour. This CD is one of his best, along with Hell's Kitchen. If you like underground rap, definitely give this one a try. It's on the top shelf for me."
2,"Strawberry soda, garlic bread, and steak.","First off that has to be the worst rhyme I've ever heard in my life... Andre Nickatina (in the rapping world) is one of the worst i've ever heard, but if you're into dope beats and his style in flowing with them (reminds me of someone on the ocean just being carried by waves, paddling every which way to stay with them), and what i mean by that is he tries to keep up with the pace and the beat and says (what feels like) every single thing that pops into his head from coke to what he had for dinner that night. But overall, ""if you can't dig it like its shovelled man i guess you ain't able"" summs this and the rest of the Nickatina c.d.s up."
5,This CD really rocks with the Spirit of God,"The CD starts off fast paced and keeps it up with several really rocking selections, then it goes into some great worship songs of a slower pace. It eventually picks up the beat once more. The music and voices quality are excellent and I really enjoyed listening to the entire CD. I would highly recommend this CD to anyone wanting a worship and praise experience with a great beat and true spirit."
5,Great series,"After reading the previous books, I was ecstatic to find the legends of the raven series. Could not put them down!"
4,It you like frozen or chilled desserts...,"that usually contain some type of liqueur, then this is the book for you. The pictures are lovely and the recipes are unique. A couple things: Several of the recipes require an icecream machine. The book says you can make them without it but that doesn't work so well. Also, this book was publish in England so I didn't have access to some of the ingredients here in the States. Gooseberries anyone?"
4,The best part of this book is the beautiful pictures...,"I've looked over them many times because they are so lovely. The down side is that I haven't made many of the recipes because I don't have an icecream maker or the time to make these intricate desserts. However, if I wanted to impress people with a gorgeous frozen or chilled dessert, this is the first place I'd turn."
2,if you should damage ANYTHING,"If you break glass, get a leak, the lock stops working bestop will not offer replacement parts even for sale on these. there is no customer service just apologies from bestop regarding the lack of serviceability."
3,its ok,Slider winds I thought would be a world better than zipper windows but instead reaching out at a drive thru is a pain and any sort of dirt on them makes me pucker up when I hear that screeching sound when sliders are opened. If not clean you can only open front part. Windows leak water pretty bad too.
2,More Star Wars than Honor Harrington,"As I read this, I kept trying to figure out which series the reviewers had not read - this one or the Harrington books. The protagonists are female space navy officers: end of similarity.Harrington is a retelling of Horatio Hornblower / Admiral Nelson in a science fiction background - complete to loosing an eye and an arm. She commands ships and fleets in battle.In this book, the heroine is on a quest to repeat the accomplishments of a legendary alien hero - complete with ghosts and mystical visions.If someone really wants to quibble: Harrington has a symbiotic partner (Nimitz can hardly be called a pet) who is empathic, but stops far short the mysticism found here."
3,Where is the action?,"I got more than half way through this book and was finding it hard to keep reading about alien dreams , mystical legends and sensitive beings with physic powers who are able probe others minds and control them. The story revolves around a woman who finds that she is also a sensitive as well , as her and her alien bird friend share touching and feminine feelings for one another as the story continues with more dreams , more visions and hardly a things to do with space battle tactics. This mellowed out fantasized space drama hardly has anything to do with the Imperial Navy or the Marines. Although there presents are there , the role they play is minimal and their actions are more of an afterthought. The book is well written and I can see why some people would like it , however it's just not for me."
3,Great . . . Except for the Ending,"For the first 95% of this book, I would have to say it is one of the most entertaining sci-fi books I have ever read, and very well-crafted. The end, however, was a total disappointment. It was as if the author suddenly got tired of writing and had to tie up some loose ends in the last 25 or so pages (King's ""The Stand"" comes to mind in this regard). Even assuming that this was not the real ending (i.e. there will be a sequel) it wasn't a customary pre-sequel ending, keeping the reader in suspense on what might happen next -- it just kind of fizzles out. I just found it odd in such an otherwise wonderful piece of writing."
4,"If you love space opera, here's a series for you","I won't try to rehash what others here have said so well. My observations are limited to the following: First, the build up and characterization are stunning, but the finish leaves you somewhat unfulfilled. It deserved better. Second, I absolutely, thouroughly enjoyed the way Hunt's alien culture and psychology were driven so convincingly by their physiology. This was opera I could believe, consistant and convincing within it's own universe. Perhaps Hunt will write a 5th book to finish the story in the way it deserves. If he does, I will plunk down my cash without hesitation."
5,Be careful...,"Being a UK Blu-ray, the concert is in 1080/50i which means that many US PS3s and TVs can't handle the reduced frame rate 50hz instead of 60hz. As for the extras not working, it's possible that those are in standard resolution and therefore in the PAL format."
3,"GREAT BLU-RAY, BUT BEWARE....","First I'd like to say that the concert part is great! BUT, the extra features on the disc, photo gallery and 2 bonus videos DO NOT WORK! I had to return the first Blu-ray back to Amazon to get a new one and the second one sent out had the same problem. I placed these Blu-rays in two different Blu-ray players and the same problem, so their is a problem in the making of this disc. So, If you JUST want the concert, GREAT. But the extra content, forget it!"
4,First Blu-ray version of a concert,"I was completely imprssed from the video to the sound mix...Joey still has the voice, and I enjoyed the new songs...recommended buy!"
1,It doesn't work in PS3,This Blue Ray doesn't work in Play Station 3 which is a blue ray player. I wrote to amazon and they ask me to send it back which is expensive for me in Colombia.If you have a PS3 as a blue ray player DON'T BUY IT!!!
2,Film editor should be shot!,"This could have been a GREAT DVD. Unfortunately, as others have pointed out, it's poorly shot and very poorly edited. The shot never last longer than 2 seconds and is often zooming very quickly! During guitar solos, the video should show the guitarist. As to the bands performance and sound, all is good!EDIT: All is not good. I found that I couldn't watch this dvd anymore. Too many scene cuts and not very interesting from a visual perspective. Funny thing is that the concert on the bonus is filmed much better, too bad it's incomplete. Ended up selling...."

5,The best footage of Apollo 11 - on one DVD,I remember seeing a clip of the Apollo 11 moon landing on CBS and I loved it. I checked out this DVD and this is the best footage of Apollo 11. The best part about this is that the moonwalk is restored and you don't have to hear any television network announcers. You even get to see color photos during the television transmissions. I am happy to say that the photos are a lot nicer to see.I feel that Spacecraft Films did such a wonderful job with this release and I look forward to seeing more releases from Spacecraft Films.
2,OUCH-KABOOBLE! (As Austin Powers says),"I guess this radio was designed by a grey alien because it HURTS MY EARS! OUCHKABOOBLE!!!!!I am a human last I checked and these alien peripherals just plain hurt!Also, the reception plain stinks, I use it around the house with an FM transmitter hooked up to my computer which allows me to walk around and listen to my favorite radio shows. For that the reception is good, but then again, I'm the broadcasting station.The ear pieces have to go! or sell them in Beta Reticuli.I MISS MY HM55 which broke after 5 years of use. Why isn't Sony making them any more? This is total junk!"
4,Hallowen Bonanza!,"These headphones are perfect for Halloween - you are sure to frighten all the local children. Adults will think they know better and will wonder what a NASA astronaut with his/her funky headgear is doing in your neighborhood. Only you will know the truth behind this telekinetic/telepathic transmission device. In addition to the various high-tech features, you also have a constant digging pain in your cranium - a reminder of the sins you have commited by scaring those neighborhood kids. Truly a bargain at any price!"
2,Comfortable it's not.,"The tiny earbuds looked like a better idea. I'm used to my Etymotic earbuds and expected a move ahead from Sony. Instead, it was a giant lurch backward. The electronics have improved over earlier models, but those pesky earbuds - OUCH!!! Be sure to try one on before you spend your bucks on one."
1,Sony SRFHM03V Sports Walkman Digital Tuning TV/Weather/FM/AMHeadphone Radio,"NO STARS for this product - it is very uncomfortable to wear the ear pieces (plugs) are painful, it is heavy and slips off my head, when I try to grab it from slipping I naturally put my hands on the outer ear pieces which screws up all the digital buttons and the reception is fair. There wasn't a 0 Star to choose."
4,Hurts and has piercing high pitch noise,"I bought this for use at the gym where different TVs are set to different frequencies. Ear plugs are made of a hard plastics and hurt my ears. When tuned to any frequency,you can hear a high frequency continuous noise.Sony should take this product back and apologize to its customers."
5,No greasy feeling,I like using this EltaMD moisturizer especially in the morning as it leaves no greasy feeling. I apply a dime size about because that is what you need. I end apply my makeup on top and it feels good.
3,For dry skin.,"I have a sensitive with combination skin type. Its was okay, it leaves the skin with soft and un-heavy feeling. But its clearly for dry skin, its written on the box but not in the description !"
3,A little dry,"My friend highly recommended it and thus I tried.But after using it, I felt a little dry. Since I have a kind of dry skin, I gave to my friend."
2,elta md spf face lotion,i have been using this for about one month now on top of the elta md face cleanser and between the 2 my face is soo dry and peeling and i am breaking out soooo bad! this product was highly recommended by my dermatologist and i am very disappointed they are not performing well
2,Makes my skin painfully dry,"This lotion goes on nicely in the AM but by early afternoon my face is painfully dry, to the point where I feel like my skin will crack if I smile. I hate being the only negative review but maybe my skin is having a reaction to this lotion. At a minimum I would say this lotion is not for dry skin. I'm 50, BTW."
5,Use it every day,This brand was recommended to me by my dermatologist and I like this product in particular over most other daily moisturizers that I've used. I like the fact that zinc isn't as toxic as some of the ingredients of other sunscreens and like that it seems to absorb into my skin quite well. I haven't noticed any white haze or chalkiness.
1,"This is a cassette, not a cd...that's what i got.",I thought it was the original tracks minus the vocals. It is not. It was disappointing. The songs are all one key higher than the originals.
4,Gomorrha - 'I Turned To See Whose Voice It Was' (Repertoire),"Originally released in 1972,still not sure if Gomorrha had actually put out two OR three lp's.Keep hearing of a third album,but I've never seen much info about it.About as good as their 'Trauma' CD reissue(see my review).Haven't been able to locate much about this short-lived '70's krautrock six piece at all.I do know that I like what I hear.Tracks here that make this disc a keeper are the heavy-rockin' lengthy opener ""Dance Of The Volcano"",""Dead Life"" and the psychedelic jamming ""I Try To Change The World"".Line-up:Peter Otten-vocals,Ad Ochel&Ali Claudi-guitars,Mike Eulner-bass,Eberhard Krietsch-organ&piano and Helmuth Pohl-drums.Just might appeal to fans of Guru Guru,Dom,2066 And Then and Faust."
5,Best Book on Franchising Today,There are simply not enough books on franchising today. This book is a wealth of knowledge for anyone interested in franchising either as a prospective franchisee or involved in the industry as a franchisor. Most of the books on the market are geared towards franchisees - this book really serves as a great primer for the industry as a whole and a solid guide for franchisors. It is required reading in our company and I recomend it to candidates. Thanks to the authors for sharing their gems with the rest of us.
2,"If you want to franchise your buisness, don't buy this book!","I purchased this book to help me in franchising my business. I found it hard to read, confusung, boring, and full of legal jargon that I could not understand."
2,Better to look elsewhere,"Waste of time, waste of money and waste of brain power. Better franchise books out there."
5,"Perfect for that classy, unique person in your life","I wish I could give a description of this fragrance, because it is one of my favorites, but I really can't- it's sort of springy, not too light, not overpowering but unusual enough to stand out from all those cheap candy-coated b.s. fragrances out there. Very unique. Definitely smells expensive, with lots of subtleties - floral but not your typical floral.I'm prety sure I smell iris in there. The fact that this stuff doesn't smell too much like any one thing makes me want to keep sniffing, obsessively. Kinda reminds me of eccentric rich people. Boyfriend doesn't like it, but I don't care. I like it enough to wear it anyway and deal with the whining."
3,is this the real thing?,"I received the Angel order and was very happy about it, until I opened it and tried to register online with Theirry Mugler at the website I've visted often. The product had its' key code removed/blackened out on the inside bottom of the package. I then concluded the product was not legitimate but had been rewrapped! Also, the fragrance disappeared rather quickly after applying, and since I have been wearing Angel for years, realized this couldn't be the original version but a watered down one-hence why the price was the best I could find around online. Would not order again from this dealer and suggest Amazon take the time to scrutinize who they are allowing to sell from their site. The product came from an individual's address, and not the company ordered from on your site."
3,"Useful, but not for me.","This container is a great idea and is good for maybe an overnight stay somewhere. I have large dogs, so it doesn't hold THAT much food for them. But the biggest complaint I have about this product is that it can be very difficult to get the bowls off the container. And if you're out and about and can't dry the bowls after using something wet in them, it will make a mess. Others might find this to be awesome but it ended up being too bulky and inconvenient for me."
5,Great gift idea!,"I bought this as a gift for a friends dogs! They are alwasy on the GO! I was quite impressed with this item. Wish it came in other colors, however. Great idea to have on the travels in the car! woof! :)"
5,Really handy container,"I bought this for my new puppy when we went to visit my parents, but now a year later, I'm still using it all the time. It fits about 7 cups of food in it, which is about 4-5 days worth of food for him (21 lb. male Scottish Terrier). Unfortunately, I lost the black handle that secures the two containers, but since they fit pretty closely, it hasn't been too much of an issue."
4,"Good container, bowls flip over too easily","I only have two problems with this product:-My dog knocks the blue bowls over too easily (they're too tall/not wide enough to be very stable)-The handle that holds the bowls onto the jar is easy to lose. I usually end up slapping the blue bowls on without attaching the handle.-putting the bowls back on the container traps moisture and bacteria between the two. when you get home you have to clean up everything, including the outside of the container =\in my opinion, you'd be better served by reusing a container for food and getting a couple collapsible bowls. At the current ten buck price, this is way too much. I got it for half that a while back, and while it's worth that much for me, I probably wouldn't buy another."
2,Do NOT put in dishwasher!!!!,"The first one I purchased I put in my dishwasher and it came out ruined...So I bought a second one. I figured it was my fault for putting it on the bottom, and I did not see anywhere that clearly stated that it was not dishwasher safe. I since bought a new dishwasher that does not have the heating elements at the bottom, so I figured I was safe to put the new bowl in the dishwasher on the top rack...NOPE! It melted and deformed and I had to throw it away. They need to be more clear that it is NOT dishwasher safe."
2,2500 True Type Fonts,Font manager is not user friendly. There is no logical indexing or grouping of fonts. User is forced to hunt and peck.
3,Thought provoking,"What can you do to make life more wonderful? According to Marshall Rosenberg you can change how you speak.This might work for you if you accept the notion that what proceeds out of a loving heart will trump all the benefits you hope for via a competitive approach.Marshall agrees that for the 8000 years we have perpetuated a dualistic world view, a source of much conflict.According to Marshall, we can use our own deep seated longing to be good, to fuel our giving.His approach is not difficult to understand; each person will struggle with how deeply they may be able to go with it. It is radical.There is much that can be enjoyed here. He performs some original songs which put me in mind of Mr. Rogers.A discordant note still ringing for me was struck in his material about his work with a pedophile. One might conclude from the presentation that those acts were engaged in because of a need to be understood."
5,"Love, love, love it!",This one never gets old. She sings of her new life in Jesus Christ and the victory she walks in every day. Highly recommended.
5,Older model razor that holds up well,"I bought this model razor for my husband as a gift in 2004. It's still working just as well as the day he bought it and gives him a nice close shave. It's easy to keep new as well with maintenance items like theBraun Clean & Renew Refills (3 Pack)andBraun 7000 Series Syncro Pro / Syncro Replacement Comboavailable from Amazon.He often uses it in his car, so it's convenient both at home and on the road, and doesn't require daily charging.Back in 2004, this model ran around $250, so the price today is also very good."
5,Magical memories,"Even though this series only lasted one season it is still worth getting, they should make a movie (and not for kiddies)."
4,If you love ballet....,...you'll love this recording. Even if you don't love ballet you may enjoy it. I have had friends borrow it who normally would never watch ballet and tell me they enjoyed it. Believe it or not I bought this as a gift for my husband while I was trying to track down a copy of La Cenerentola. It wasn't what I expected (my fault) but we were anything but disappointing.
2,"Of Comic, not Dancing Interest","The focus here is on comedy. This version of Cinderella tells the story, but the concentration is not on the dancing. Cinderella is played by someone who seems an okay dancer, but isn't a very good actress. If you are looking for highly choregraphed ballet, this is not the thing you want. The dancing seems at best secondary. There are some amusing moments here. The Prince, searching for the girl who left the slipper, mounts what is like a playground horse, and goes nowhere really, just bounces up and down on it. If you don't care about the lack of dancing, you'll probably enjoy this"
2,I ordered this item a month ago for 5$ less.,"I am disappointed in the increase cost of the item. It was $ 17.99 a month ago and now it is $ 22.99. This is about the same cost you can get in a store. So, it is a great disappointment to see the increase. You have lost my business due to this.Disappointed Mother!"
2,It doesn't mix well at all,"My son was on Enfamil Prosobee, but I tried Isomil because I order his diapers through Amazon and Prosobee wasn't available. I have to say that Isomil fails in comparison. First of all, I have had a hard time mixing it. I shake his bottles well, but no matter how long I seem to shake, there's always an unmixed clump in the bottle. I never had this problem with Prosobee. Second, when using Isomil, his eczema got worse. The only change in his diet was the formula. We're back to Prosobee LIPIL hoping that soon Amazon will carry it."
5,amazing book of courage,"This is an amazing book of courage. This wonderful family went through so much and it really makes you feel grateful for the happy, healthy, screaming children you have. As any mother knows, she would give her right arm (and anything else) to take away her childs pain. So many things that we as a society take for granted until it is taken away. This is a story of courage and strenth on all levels. I loved it from the first page, very descriptive and well written. Congratulations Nancy, your son will meet you at the pearly gates of heaven someday. God ways are not our ways. My prayer is that this book will help others going through a similar situation. My prayers to you and your family. God Bless you!"
2,There are much better thrillers out there,"I usually read science fiction and non-fiction, but I was looking for a break from such heady reading and wanted something easy and fun. I came across this novel in the library and it looked like it fit the bill.Indeed, The Brotherhood of the Tomb offers a fast-paced story with the standard fare of twists and turns, but unlike many of the other reviewers here I found the writing quality to be poor and the plotline to not be believable. Instead of having fun, I found myself frustrated that the book wasn't getting any better and put it down about halfway through.I'm generally not crazy about stories that portray the Catholic Church as hiring assassins to protect its secrets, but Dan Brown'sThe Da Vinci Codeand David Morrell'sFraternity of the Stonehad similar themes and I didn't find them tedious or poorly written. Chances are you've already readThe Da Vinci Code, so fans of the ""Vatican as CIA"" theme might check outFraternity of the Stoneas a better option."
5,The best book you will ever read,I rarely read a book twice but this one I have just read for a third time. It is an international thriller to the greatest degree. I have since read all of the author's other books but I still like this one the best.
2,too narrative and paint by the numbers,"Two things are obvious: Diana Diamond, pseudonym, is a man and his main goal is getting his advance rather than making a magical entertaining novel.. I read The Babysitter and enjoyed..it then I read..the Good Sister...and it was so amateurisly done, I stopped reading the novel after 100 pages...then after the big hype..here I am..reading ""the First Wife"" and find...he's making the same sophomoric mistakes...we get the heroine's thoughts in a rambling narrative..but see very few dramatic scenes...all writer's courses..shout..show don't tell..obviously...he missed that...It's much harder to pen ""good dramatic"" scenes....easy to use narrative.....why is he squandering his wonderful mind..(I detect a first rate mind here)?????I'll let you know...my final verdict...should I continue..though I might..just shelve it, considering I have better things to do with my time.."
3,Cheap but it works,"I was kind of apprehensive to buy this with all the reviews, but it works just fine. It's cute. Kind of a pain to get on though, I can understand how some of them would not shut. I think it has to do with the service you got your phone from- mine is from AT&T and I have a friend who's is from Sprint, and there are a LOT of differences."
5,Truely touching,"Although I loved every book in the last vampire series, Creatures of forever was the greatest. By the time I had read this book, I admired Alisa, I felt as if I had watched her grow. From a blood thristy vamp in black leather to a spirtual, open minded goddess. By the end of the series I felt close to Alisa, and after I finished the book, I just cried. Creatures of forever had a beautiful ending, a talent Pike never seems to flaw... even Seymour I felt close to by book six. I really recomend this book to anyone, but suggest you start with the Last vampire 1 and work your way to creatures of forever, the book that changed my view of life."
5,This series was the best I have ever read!!!,"I love the last vampire series with all my heart and soul!!! when i am in a bad predicament i just think about what sita would do and it ALWAYS helps. I dont think that the last book should have ended like it did. i didnt want seymor to die, wishing he had sita to make his pain go away. i think that the series should be made into a movie, if not that, then the series should continue. my favorite parts in the series is when the people say they dont want to die and she says, ""the you should have never been born"" since i have read her books, i have bought my own dagger and have always been searching for a time to say her words. Alisa Perne, Laura Adams, Sita, whatever you want to call her, rulz!!! also, since then i have tried to become the great writer that christopher pike is, i have publishe 3 poems and i am working on publishing a book called Loves Fury, without C>P, i wuold be lost. Thanks."
5,The Last Vampire 6 was wonderful,I have read this series from the beginning. The entire series is a true masterpiece. Creatures of Forever was both joyful and sad. I cried at the end of the book because I UNDERSTOOD. I knew her and it could of been the girl down the street. I was unhappy with the way he left it at first but I then realized it was in direct harmony with Sita herself.I only wish that it could of ended differently. I will miss having the series to read. I finished it last year and still have yet to come accross a recent book that even begins to compare. I hope it is treasured forever.
5,I will never forget it,I loved the whole series. I especially liked the ending when Sita can live her life the way she always wanted. I'm glad we know who Sita was telling the story to. I wanted to know from the start. I will continue reading Mr.Pike's books!
5,unspeakable!,"This book is fantastic! Words alone cannot describe how The Last Vampire series has affected me, and to think I cried after reading this book. It pains me to see that Sita ended it like that, and I wondered about all the future adventures, people, and experiences she would never see/meet/live....But I do see this as a potential hit movie! With special effects it could do wonders!! Especially when Sita's blood mends her torn-apart body! Also, it has an extremely touching storyline, besides the action, and that would make a fabulous movie in my opinion!"
4,Midsummer Night,"The whole series took me about 3 years to read, even though I thoroughly enjoyed the books I didn't have much time for constant catching up. The Last vampire series is one of my all time favorites. When I'm in a situation I'd think, what wouls Alisa(Sita) do (other than kill). I totally bonded with her and her pain hurt me too. When I read the 6th novel on the train, I was shocked with the ending. I kept on looking for more pages, but... Wish there were more. I wish for an Oxford Dictionary size Sita novel. I really do. And even though I'm in college and I read Freud and other thinkers, I still go to the bokstore and charge five Pike books at a time. I love reading them on the train going to school. The last book minght not be the best, but it was awesome. I just love them all. Everyone else-enjoy! thank you fo rreading."
5,Haunting,I thought this book was the best of the Last Vampire series. Christopher Pike came through with yet another haunting novel about Sita. The characters were wonderful and the twist at the end was great. Does anyone know when his new books about Sita's earlier adventures are coming out?
3,Took me almost 5 years to read this...,"I first got hold of this book when I was 13, and did not bother reading it cover to cover until I was 17. I had read the first few chapters of the book and got bored because it got too super natural (hard to believe when its about vampires right?) and returned it to my friend, only to buy it years later. The only thing I liked about the book was the ending, which was kind of sad and depressing, like life. It made you think about stuff in life and all."
5,An amazing ending,"Out of all of Pike's books, this one is the best one I've read. I love the whole vampire series and found all of them enjoyable, but this is the BEST. I won't give away the ending, but I'll say it is a surprise you wouldn't suspect Sita to have up her sleeve. It is very well written and although sometimes it's a bit mind boggling, it's worth it. It is definately his most thought provoking book. PS If you liked Krishna's role in the books, you'll like this."
2,What a ridiculous plot!!,I loved books 1-5 and I couldn't wait to read book six and I found parts of it to be very good and it kept me turning the pages despite the aliens and the flying saucer but the end has left me extremely disappointed and annoyed. The whole ending creates such a paradox that it isn't credible. It leaves a lot of loose ends in my mind. It is very disappointing! So if you are going to read this series stop at number 5!
3,unfortunate ending,"i don't know why it took me so long to give my opinion but this last book in the series simply didn't satisfy me. the wrap up just wasn't what i had hoped it would be. i do understand it but it's sad to think that Sita basically sacrified all that was a 5,000 year old life for all of mankind and balance out the power of good & evil. i guess i'm just disappointed. as i reread the series over and over throughout the years, i always am reluctant to read the end.i did, however, hope that someday c. pike would write the story of yaksha and his endeavors. but he seems to prefer writing female protagonists."
5,Oustanding book on graffiti art,"As a graffiti lover, I LOVE this book--great pictures of amazing tags in beautiful color. Anyone brought up in a big city and familair with graffiti will enjoy this book."
4,"-Bible says, our body's a temple, perhaps not only for God,",This book delves deep and is philosophic in origins.
4,One Big Suprise-true or false?,"This is an enjoyable romp thru the Beatles history marred only by some suprising inaccuricies. They can mostly be overlooked as so much time has passed and a lot of alcohol has gone over the dam since then.HOWEVER-there is a claim made in the book that I have never heard before and am really wondering about. Bramwell states the entire Shea Stadium concert of 1965 was re-recorded in the studio and dubbed onto the film shown on CBS the following year. With the exception of ""Act Naturally"", the studio version of which is used in the film, it appears the Beatles are playing and singing live. Has anyone heard of this, or has it been confirmed thru another source? Just wondering.One last thought. This book is not likely to make Yoko Ono's end of the year top ten list. She has to be one of the most annoying people of the last century. What the hell was John Lennon thinking?"
3,"Okay, but a few formatting issues.","A friend lent me this book to read several years ago. I decided I wanted to reread it, and got the Kindle edition for my tablet. I've been enjoying it again, but the Kindle edition has some issues with words squeezed together here and there. Not enough to be a hassle, but enough to make me wonder if that's why they reduced the price on the Kindle edition.Otherwise, a very engaging account by a man who grew up in Liverpool with George and Paul, and knew all the Beatles from their earliest times playing together, through the crazy days of Apple and beyond."
2,It Might Be A Magical Mystery Bore.,"Having read several Beatles books, such as ""The Love You Make,"" and Pete Best's ""Beatle"" book, Brian Epstein's ""Cellar Full of Noise,"" a Paul McCartney biography, a Lennon biography by his sister, etc., this book repeats a lot of the same information printed before about the Beatles. I feel disappointed in that the book sounds like Tony Bramwell borrowed material from other Beatles books to write this one. I don't see where the book is really very original, except that all of the photos are new to me. In these photos, Bramwell likes to identify where he is in the photo, just in case you cannot possibly figure it out who he is. I mean, ""Ok, Tony, we know who you are!"" The book ""The Love You Make"" is a work of great originality, something truly from the pen of Peter Brown; but ""Magical Mystery Tours"" is material borrowed from other Beatles books with cursory new details thrown in. But, you know, it's an OK book."
3,Disappointment,"I'm not sure what I was expecting when I bought this book. Maybe I misunderstood the title ""My Life with the Beatles"", as meaning well, ""My Life with the Beatles"". It is in one sense, but more of the book is about the Beatles in Tony Bramwell's life, and an awful lot about Brian Epstein, and a huge cast of famous and not so famous 1960's musicians and want-to-be musicians. He talks about all the girls he made it with and his absolute hatred of Yoko. He definitely favors Paul McCartney to the other three Beatles and says that John Lennon heard voices and saw faces in the mirror that wasn't his. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the book was a disappointment to me because I thought that someone on the inside from the days before they were the Beatles would have a little more insight into the lads from Liverpool."
3,Hatred of Yoko Spoils What Could Have Been Something Special,"Mr. Bramwell really did know the Beatles in Liverpool and the beginning sections of this book are excellent. Unfortunately Mr. Bramwell's blinding hatred of Yoko Ono really spoils the latter half. Mr. Bramwell puts an anti-Yoko, pro-Paul statement on practically every page and and some of his ommissions and misstatements are really egregious. Once Yoko enters the picture, Paul can do no wrong, and John's contributions are constantly minimized. Perhaps Yoko really was as loathsome to Mr. Bramwell as he claims when he worked for Apple. But his description of the complex Paul/John/Yoko dynamic is simply too vitrolic to be taken seriously."
3,Curious,"This book is required reading for any Beatles enthusiast; however, although Bramwell seemingly has the credentials--knowing Paul and George since childhood--to write such a book, including blow-by-blow dialogue with the lads no less, I found it curious that Bramwell is only mentioned once in the index of McCartney's 654 page (auto)biographical tome, MANY YEARS FROM NOW. Seems Bramwell didn't loom too large as far as McCartney was concerned. What gives, Tony?"
1,Pointless,"I purchased this book in hopes that it would provide some practical information on what type of web bots are available and how they could be used. It read more like a fictional novel then anything. Going on and on about how web bots are taking over. Pointless, simply pointless."
4,"Bots Great, Unless You're Hopelessly Retentive","So, the latest round in the ongoing battle between retentive techies who prize books for their superior incomprehensibility and pared-down utilitarianism.If you're the kind of reader who enjoys a good read and wants to learn about a technical subject in language which is not technical and doesn't assume prior knowledge, then you're going to enjoy Andrew Leonard's Bots a great deal. It's well-written, flows beautifully, and for this relatively inexpert reader, put a lot of technical details in perspective.If you're looking for highly technical, jargon-choked how-to manual on bot programming, then this isn't the book for you. But you should know that already, unless your reading skills are hopelessly deficient. Which, come to think of it, is probably the case for many technogeeks."
5,Everything the description says and then some,"I bought this because I am a great Lorca fan. However I find this criticism set is a good introduction to a future reading list.Frederico Garcia Lorca got 22 pages, a black and white portrait, and a list of principle works. There are a few references to one of my favorite plays ""The Butterfly's Evil Spell"" 1954.I have the hard cover set and it looks good in my reference library. I would be willing to also purchase an electronic version if it ever appears.To help find this set:ISBN-10: 0810391457ISBN-13: 9780810391451"
5,supraphon excellent,"this recording is excellent. Lovro was not a Czech conductor, but he was from Yugoslavia. The cd offers a good description in English, French amongst others. It sure gives the music its place. With or without out explanation one will notice soon that these recvording is superb. The explanation is luxury which for this time is really added value. I really enjoy this recording. I bought this one for budget-price. When this would be offered for a different price I would ofcourse have had doubts. Intense music."
5,"Sudoku, Bridges, and Slitherlink","There are a lot of Su Doku book on the market but most of them are aimed at the beginner and novice. I have had a hard time finding harder puzzles. This book has some.Most of this book is taken up with the familiar 9X9 grid su doku puzzles but there are two other types of puzzles as well. Second is a puzzle called bridges. Numbered circles represent islands and the number is the number of bridges that connect tit to surrounding island. Like su doku, a simple set of rules drives the logic for finding the unique solution. The final puzzle is slitherlink. A matrix has numbers that represent how many of the sides of its cell will be filled in. The object is to satisfy all of the numbers and complete a continuous loop.A good book if you are looking for something a little different or just want puzzles that are a little more challenging than what most of the other books are offering."
5,good album.,"very good album, if you like it you should get curse of the coffin, just as good but faster"
3,We're the Nekromantix...,"...frontman Kim Nekroman sings on track 1, and I've gotta say that I have seldom hear a band introduced themselves as ""right in your face"" as these guys does! This album may not be their best and it may not be their worst, but anyhow..it's a classic. Tracks like Brain Error, Bloodtide, Graveyard in your Memory and Spiders attacking Manhattan are just plain simple amazing..totally different from any other psychobilly I'd heard back in 1990. This is not an album for everybody, but if you're into Nekromantix this'll most certainly be worth buying, but if you're one of those new kids who only started listening to them cause that's what Tiger Army do""...don't buy it!"
1,Ridiculous!!!,"This book is ridiculous. The advice she gives must be for pent-up housewives living in the 1920's, because I don't need someone to spend three pages categorizing the different types of kisses for me. There is absolutely no practical advice in this book."
2,Interesting but nothing new,Nothing revolutionaryInteresting principles for someone who wants to pick a first book of this kind. There are better choices
2,bad choice,"Photos look really bad. I don't know if it's because they are over 500KB in size. But even if it's because of that, come on, get real. It shouldn't be like that. I also tried to play a short video that was taken with my digital camera and nothing came out. Well, a weird sound came later (???)."
3,Good for Price,"You're going to get what you paid for - watch out for the low resolution and the widescreen format, doesn't match camera format. Chops off if you lower the res, takes forever and chops the other way if you don't. for the money, a good one though!"
4,good product - basic features,"Purchased this as a Mothers day gift, and so far it's been great. She loved it and brings it to family events to show off pictures.Pros: decent size, screen is plenty bright, and frame doesn't look too cheap. Cool how you can play music and pictures together. I haven't tried out video. Overall I'm satisfied.Cons: It is a little fritzy when it comes to adding images to an SD card when using the USB plug. Sometimes the card wouldn't show up, the pictures wouldn't copy, or they'd come accross distorted. Restarting the frame several times often worked, but it was annoying. Luckily my Mom has an SD card reader on her computer so she just puts images on it that way."
2,Hard to resize pics to use full screen,I bought and returned the 7in Frame. Getting the pics on the frame was super easy although the pics did not look good at all. If the pic was not taken in widescreen it will not fill up the complete frame window. There is black space on both sides of the picture. It does not optimize your pic for you to fit nicely in the space available. I was unable to work with my pics to resize them and get them looking good in the frame. It was too much work for not a very nice looking result.
1,"Good Idea, Bad Product","I have now gone through TWO frames. The first one had a software problem. The second one could not play music. The product is exactly what you pay for, a cheap imitation of a name brand frame. Don't buy this. Pay the extra $100 and get a reliable one. It will take you at least one hour to get through to Coby's customer support and every time their answer is.. ""There's a problem, return it."" Buyer beware."
2,Aspect ratio is a problem...,"I ordered this version of the Coby digital picture frame after having the 5.6"" version which I loved. This one was a disappointment because of the wide-screen aspect ratio. For photographs, the added size of the screen was not usable. Either the extra space was wasted (black bars) or the pictures were distorted (if you use the setting to expand to fill the screen).I recommend NOT getting any digital picture frame with wide-screen aspect ratio if your intended use is to view photographs."
2,Tech review,The clarity was not so good. Mp3 version issues exists (only few version supported) The slide show mode is not playing music.
1,Will be returning product,"Bad resolution. Looks very cheap.I will be returning this because it won't play my avi or mpeg-4 files. It freezes when I try to play them or just shows a black blank screen. I created a presentation on flash and converted the .swf to .avi and mpeg-4, but still didn't work."
4,It's nice,Nothing really to complain about. The pictures that my camera takes don't fit perfectly on the screen but it still looks fine. Things look pixelated up close but if your watching from a couple feet away it looks good. I can't really complain.
1,Does Not Meet Spec,"Coby states that the DP-772 will display JPEG and BMP formats but it does not. It will not display BMP, and fails to display grayscale JPEG, as confirmed by their tech support. The corporation will not respond to the complaint, while replacing the DP-772 is fruitless because all units have the same problems."
3,Not a bad deal..,"I picked up this digital photo frame to display the thousands of pictures that I've taken over the years residing on my hard drive. I found the MP3 player option completely useless, a TV playing at a reasonable level will drown it out completely. I was also disappointed with the widescreen panel. Basically all digital cameras take pictures in 4:3 anyways so a 16:9 photo frame doesn't make much sense. A 7"" 4:3 panel would make image viewing much easier and clearer. You do have the option to stretch your 4:3 photos to the widescreen format however. In all I found the interface acceptable but decided to give this as a gift to my mother since she has the same dilemma, lots of photos but no easy way to view them."
3,Okay as an entry product,"I bought this for Mother's Day for my wife. Initial setup was straight forward and easy with the manual. The fact it has no internal memory is a drawback but makes it a lot less expensive. The remote is easy to use and the shuffle feature is nice. It only uses memory cards so I bought a 2GB card for $20 on sale, and it holds all the pictures I care to display, plus music for the music feature in the frame. The resolution is not real great, and the colors tend to wash out in a bright room. But for the price it is a very good product. Just plug it in, load a card with pictures and music, and let the memories scroll by."
4,Made a nice gift,We bought this as a gift for a relative. He seems very pleased with it. We put a flash card in it and it worked fine. There was even a music file on the flash card and it played as the pictures displayed. Seems like a nice frame.
2,Poor process control,The screen is great - the images are sharp enough. The problem is that the materials used are poor (cheap plastic). Both of my interchangable frames had defects. I would recommend against buying this frame.
1,"Almost there, but Videos don't work","The claim that most MP4 and AVI files from digital cameras will play is incorrect. I have a Sony and Fuji camera and neither will work with this digital frame. There have been 3 attempts (over a month ago) to the Coby Tech Support that have apparently been sent to a black hole because they have not responded. The question that I asked is what are the parameters needed to support playback for the AVI and MP4 videos. These are needed to convert from videos that work to ones that work with the DP772. In this issue I am very dissapointed with Coby as a company. If they had the curtesy to respond and the DP772 will play the videos, I would rate this product as a 5."
1,Poor Picture Quality,The picture quality is really bad. No settings available to fix it. Do not buy this product. I am returning mine.
1,Just Plain Didn't Work,"I just got this product and was excited to plug it in and see my pictures, but...it just plain didn't work. The screen showed 10%-30% of each picture, and the rest was just fuzz and noise. Interestingly, a couple of slides showed two different pictures laced together.I'm returning it and don't plan to buy another."
3,Not very happy,"The Coby DP772 does what it says it will. However, the documentation is not very good, making it hard to set up and use."
1,Does not work properly,Bought this for my wife for Christmas after reading reviews on a few different frames. She set it up but could not get any pictures to come out clear. Followed the instructions in Chukchiboy's review with no luck. Tried pictures that didnt need to be resized and other programs to resize image and file size. Pictures were still pixelated and blurry even at a 3 foot distance. Tried to access frame from my PC with no luck yet. Have not tried the other features as this was for pictures for her desk at work.Went to Cobys website but could not any real info on this frame. Could not get any real support from them either. Will buy a frame that I can see an example of in person next time.
2,Gift for Mom that was well received but not worth the money,"The frame was a gift for my mother for Christmas. She loved it and cried and cried and cried. She has brought it to work and has thanked me probably 15 times for the thoughtful gift (I loaded roughly 500 pictures onto memory cards for her as well). I was the one with the problem though. The screen resolution is horrible. 50% of the pictures were fuzzy and grainy. She does not care, but I should have spent the money for a better one."
2,Cannot Connect to Computer,"As another person mentioned, my 5.6"" Digital Frame cannot connect to my computer. It takes multiple tries for it to even read the frame (my computer USB ports are 2.0) and when I do finally get my ""F:"" drive up and going, it says I cannot copy anything to the drive--I'm taking it back for sure. I know it reads a memory card and I can upload pictures via USB Drive, but the frame itself cannot connect to use the internal memory, which is all I really wanted to do. Good frame, but this is the second (another person in my family was having problems with hers) picture frame that is having problems. Technology is bound to fail, but there shouldn't be this type of problem right off the bat."
4,Worth The Price but not much more.,"This item is worth the price it is sold at. As written, it is important that you try to keep to the 16:9 photo size. If you do that, the photos fill the screen and look pretty good. I had some problems with the slideshow feature. I use Photoshop and the slide show absolutely would not show photos that were saved in the Progressive mode. If the photos were saved in Baseline mode there was no problem. It took a couple of hours of using the process of elimination to figure that out. It is not mentioned in the documentation anywhere. Was not able to get anyone on their 1-800 help line. I was on hold for 1/2 hour until they finally hung up on me. Documentation is not wonderful. Also, if you buy this item, make sure you look on the back side of the Styrofoam packing. The black interchangeable frame is packed there. It is very easy to overlook this and throw it away with the packaging material."
3,"Nice look, everything seems to work except Video files work like crap","Audio (mp3) - works good and I like what it shows for the song title etcPhotos (jpg) - looks ok, may be better if I resize my images).. by the way I saw people ask what to use to do this, Windows XP Image Resizer power toy is the best by far, select images.. right click... resize. Done!Video (mp4 or avi only) - does not work 80% of the time, I finally was able to get an mp4 to play but it did not synch with the audio of the file. Video basically skipped all over the place... Horrible! I could not get ANY avi's to work. Any info on this would be appreciated! I tried all types of ripping techniques, bitrates/framerates etc."
1,You get what you pay for,"I bought this because of its low price and have nothing but regret ever since. First, there's nowhere stated about its resolution on the product information - it turns out to be 480x234 which means everything is going to be pixelated regardless you crop or resize your pictures. Video function is also not working, may be because of the higher resolution of the videos and it can't buffer. I'm still searching for much better digital frame at this point, it looks like I have learnt my lesson for being cheap. But for sure, you need 640x480 resolution and above for 7"" digital frame and unless you have a keychain digital frame (in which 240x120 will be more than enough)."
3,Stylish But Clumsy,"This digital frame looks very stylish, however, I noticed that right off the bat I was having trouble with my PC recognizing the frame through the USB connection. Luckily I have a port on my PC for the flash cards and it works fine that way. Pictures are a little grainy"
3,Digital Frame,"Pros:This digital frame is fairly good.It can able to run an SD card up to 4 GB.Cons:It can not properly (rather badly) downsize the large resolution photos. And now a days, almost all cameras are of high resolution. If you watch the frame from a distance then you won't feel much difference, but if you stand near to the frame( 1or 2 feet), then you can easily identify that high resolution picture got skewed."
2,Poor Picture Quality,"I had previously bought a Phillips 7 inch digital picture frame for my home. I wanted a less expensive one for my office desk. When I got this one I downloaded the exact same pictures from my computer and the picture quality is unbelievably poor in comparison in my opinion.I have returned this one to Amazon (and love their return policy - of going on line and printing a return shipping label. Put it back in the same box and no questions asked by Amazon. Drop off at PO or give to my carrier and it is on its way).Thanks Amazon, I really like purchasing on Amazone, but was not impressed at all with the quality of this particual product."
5,"I got this for my wife, she loves it (now )","I researched this type of frame. I found this frame had the most features for the size and money. it has video output, remote control, built in speakers, and can be used as a data storage device. My wife(a network administrator)thought what am I going to do with this? I mean she was upset I got it. So I popped in the sd memory card, hit a few buttons and her eyes lite up when our daughter was dancing and singing on the screen, then I plugged it in the tv (cable not included, radio shack or camcorder) she had to go get her mom. Well now her mom and sister got one each. I recommend this. Have fun with it"
4,Original Gift*****,This is a good gift. I did to my wife to have the chance to view some times all the fotos we had take in everywhere. Is the only way...
5,At its core deeply powerful story,"Engagingly written by Katherine Grace Bond and impressively illustrated by Don Tate, The Legend Of The Valentine: An Inspirational Story Of Love And Reconciliation Is A Thoughtful, Christian picturebook recommended for children ages 4-8. The story is about a young boy, Marcus, whose daddy is in jail and who gets teased by kids at school because his skin is dark, a different color from theirs. Marcus doesn't see much use in celebrating Valentine's Day, until his granny tells him the story of Saint Valentine - a man who was thrown in jail, yet who refused to recant his faith in Jesus Christ. The Legend Of The Valentine is at its core deeply powerful story about loving one's enemies."
5,The Legend of the Valentine,An excellent story interweaving the historic story of Valentine with a current story involving a child facing bullying and a father in jail. I highly recommend this book!
5,Legend of the Valentine,"I read this book to my students every year. It is a story about love, judging one another by the size of their hearts, not the color of their skin, and Jesus and His amazing mercy and grace. Fabulous story!!"
5,Invaluable guideline!,"As a sports enthusiast and budding journalist, this book provided a very TIMELY guideline to the number of professions in this area. The explanations of positions and salaries, anecdotes and advice really helped me figure out my fit in this field. I read it from cover to cover with ease and anticipation. Excellent!"
5,Amazing BBC show,"I love this show so much! I wish there were more episodes in general, but these ones are goodies!"
5,The Vicar of Dibley,"This is the funniest British show ever. We own every season, this is the one dvd I watch over and over. It never gets old."
3,Funnier than St Vitus' dance but a poor print,"If you know Dawn French of French & Saunders, you know you are in for a very good laugh. If you also know how small villages and their residents behave, you're in for a whacking good time. Based on the real life adventures of an Anglican lady vicar in a sleepy english village, we follow the trials and tribulations of the new vicar as she slowly wins over the village's motley crew. Shot before a live audience, The series covers 3 seasons. There is a great joke at the end of each show, which always baffles Alice, the village idiot. Miss French has, so she says, left the stage and retired to her farm in cornwall. Maybe we can talk her out of it.The quailty of the BBC DVD print is poor, with a constant halo or ""burned"" effect. It's not your player, it's in the print, unusual for the Beeb."
5,"Anything of the ""Vicar"" is good...","The ""Vicar of Dibley"" has been making us laugh for years. As you know, a vicar is a parish priest in the Anglican Church. And this BBC priest and her crazy parishioners of the village of Dibley will keep you ""in stitches"" for years to come. There is one scene in the ""Autumn"" episode, with the Vicar and her beau Simon on a picnic, walking along a country lane, that still makes me laugh to this day. (I won't spoil the fun, or surprise by telling you the details.) Enjoy, Amen!"
4,"Good ""Brain Food"" Book","This isn't a ""how to"" book.. it's a picture book of examples of well designed pieces. It's great to flip through when you need a little inspiration. I find it quite useful - although I was disappointed that most of the work is dated 1996, 97, or 98 - especially for a book that is the best brochure design 2000. Other than that, it is a useful reference book for any designer, but if you're looking for a ""How to Design"" book, this isn't for you."
3,"12 ounces, I don't think so!","Lovely jug, beautiful shape. Good for safely serving 8 oz. of liquid, but not the 12 oz. that the description implies.What a surprise when I opened the box and saw the size!"
1,The Jewish Ghetto,Wendy totally left out the fact that the Vactican ran a concentration camp for Jews for over 300 years. American blacks were emancipated long before world pressure freed the Jews outside the Vicar of Christ's window.
4,Learning our states,"I found this a great tool for leaning about the states in our country. But it was a little premature for my 4 and 6 year old grandsons. The 6 year old had some fun with picking out a few states, but I am holding it for them until they are a bit older."
5,"Great, but sad",Such a good album. Every song is so well crafted and I love the energy that pours out of this band.The only drawback is that the lyrics are very sad and heartbroken. I'm wondering if the singer went through a divorce or breakup while writing this because the themes of most of the songs are very sad.
5,Boy Hits Car above all others,"Boy Hits Car is the best live band you will ever see! Their energy onstage is phenomenal! And this energy is just as strong on their albums! If you have never heard one of their albums, I challenge you to at least sample them. You will be hooked, I promise! CRegg is one of the most passionate front men you will ever see! Their new album ""The Passage"" is ground-breaking. They never cease to amaze me. This album ranges from pure hard rock to the softer side of Boy Hits Car. ""The Passage"" hasn't left my CD player since I bought it!"
3,Not Worth The Wait,"I really like Boyhitscar, but this album really just bombed for me. The songs all kind of sound the same and it gets really frustrating listening to him sing about lost-love over and over again. I'd pass on this one, but check out their previous stuff for sure."
4,Running the race....,"This is Darlene's second solo album. I enjoy it immensely. I really like ""Change Your World"" as I know where the song came from--from her heart and love of people who are suffering around the world. I absolutely adore ""Glorify Your Name"" and ""Angus Dei"". Her voice is powerful and strong, not pitchy in any way.This CD in my opinion is not quite as good as her first ""Kiss of Heaven"" but it is still necessary to anyone who considers themselves a Darlene Zschech fan and anyone who loves to worship.She is definitely running the race for God and doing exactly what He has called her to do--worship and help others worship as well.Good job Darls!"
5,Love It!,"So awesome. I can play this Album many times! All people who love to worship God, can really relate on this one!"
5,"Change Your Heart, Change Your World","I recently purchased this CD in September 2010. Five years ago I returned to Las Vegas to live for the third time. I know I was sent to live there again to change my world, my life. Although this CD is five years old, I learned about Darlene Zschech through Word of Life Christian Center which is my church in Las Vegas. I didn't know at the time that praise and worship songs would touch me so. Agnus Dei (Holy, Holy, Holy) touched my soul. It is the reason I purchased this CD. If you are ever in Las Vegas at Word of Life and you are privileged to hear the choir sing this song; trust me you will feel God's presence there. I love Darlene Zschech's interpretation as well. She is a gifted songwriter and singer. Michael W. Smith thank you for such an awesome song. I am delighted that God places people, circumstances, and situations in our lives. Change your heart, change your world."
3,"pretty, but rigid sole","This is a very cute shoe. It has excellent padding, which is a plus. However, if you are looking for a flexible shoe, do not get those. I ordered 4 different pairs of Stride Rite and those are considerably harder than the others. It is not good for a new walker."
3,Xhol - 'Motherf**ker' (Spalax),"Originally released in 1972,looks to be the krautrock band's second album.Liked the Xhol Caravan-'Electrip' disc a tad better(see my review).Xhol seems to blend jazz,inprov and strange psychedelia.Some good moments are on this CD,like ""Orgelsolo"" which is a good ambient piece with a great organ solo,""Grille"" that starts out with several minutes of crickets chirping and their thirteen minute cover,a live cut of ""Love Potion No.9"".Not for the mainstream at heart.Might appeal to fans of Embryo,Brainstorm and possibly Grobschnitt."
4,Very good for this price,"I got this lens, it very appealing to have 28-300 as I do not have to change any lens that often. It's great, the picture is very good. The zoom is amazing. The picture quality and the colors are very good. There is little stiffness when zooming but I think it will go away with use. I feel like the auto focus is a bit slow to get the right focus. But I haven't tried lens with that zoom power to really compare. I still use my 18-70 lens to capture people and wide range pictures. Finally, it's really great for this price."
5,A new and grateful experience!,"It came in perfect conditions and timing. Since I connect it to the body of my Alpha 100 I have never had the need to change it. The photos are very good and it gives the camera a very look alike of professional style. Performance in all conditions that I have tested (day, night indoors) have been great! It is the best lens for some who has too much to do in a littler time. It adapts to every situation."
2,Buyer beware,"Be sure you're actually going to get the product shown on Amazon. I ordered one and when it arrived, it was a cheaper Sigma lens with no autofocus, although the product information with the lens was for the better model that I had ordered. Looks like an unauthorized exchange of products by the seller. I'm waiting to hear how the seller tries to explain this. My rating applies to the lens I received; the lens I ordered might have been better, but the one I got is not."
2,low qurlity picture,I was not happy with qurlity of the it produce. The Sony 75-300mm is much better.
5,Great Video!,This is like the best footage I have seen with Morihei Ueshiba. Many of his techniques are beyond reproach and seem nearly invisible.Totally awesome stuff. Highly informative and I?m sure will be great in anyone?s video collection that is into Aikido
1,Dad's everything?,"Some good suggestions for day to day communication, can't wait to try some out. Although the author is very religious some may not share his passion, or beleifs. It was somewhat suprising when the text seemed to inevitably drift back to God."
3,About a badly drawn boy,3 1/2An impressive array of production arrangement went into rounding this out to be an underrated if imperfect gem in a declining catalog.
2,sub-par effort,"I keep coming back to Badly Drawn Boy after his amazing debut album. Unfortunately, time and time again I end up being disappointed. On this soundtrack album, you only get a couple decent songs. You'd be better off buying them in MP3 format and saving a bit of dough."
1,Garbage,Well I purchased two belts one lasted 1/2 hour the second still works fine i emailed the company i purchased it from with no progress at all so please watch what you order from this seller...And if you want garbage then purchase this product..
2,"it's a good book, but service was jumbled","when i initially tried to order this book, i immediately encountered a problem with a new credit card number.when i typed in the correct new number and deleted the previous old number, my request was denied. when i attempted the process the 2nd time, it was also denied. when i attempted to purchase the book a 3rd time, i was successful. the problem arose when ALL THREE requests were accepted and i was sent 3 copies of the same book. i figured i could use the second copy, but i now have the third book sitting here unopened.anyway, as i said earlier, it's a fine novel, but i did not want 3 copies -- only one."
1,Squirel on 'drugs',"Winterkill is a hard book to get into. There are constant flashbacks to the past, which makes the timeline jump around like a squirel on 'drugs'. When Jones dies the audience can see Danny's grief but cannot ""feel"" it.By the end of the novel nothing in the plot has been solved or put to rest. The audience ends the book feeling like it has just read a book like ""seinfeld"", which is a book about nothing."
4,Safety counts,"Bought this elbow pad for my 13 year old son, who is a lefty pitcher and righty hitter so his left arm is exposed at bat. Coach wanted me to get him the bigger elbow guard but got this instead. My son felt a little uncomfortable at first but got used to it. He was hitting well, so definitely no negative impact. At 14, he played for a different coach and I notice he doesn't wear it, so I guess he is more comfortable without it, if that is any indication. Anyway, take that for what its worth.....It is light weight but durable."
2,Not What I Expected,"If you are looking for a book that will illustrate physiological reasons that your workout program is not successful than this is not the book for you. If you have issues related to self esteem, overall laziness, lack of focus or depression then you might want to reconsider. There was one chapter that addresses the improper way to use exercise equipment that I found helpful; aside from this chapter the whole book is, in my opinion, an advertisement for his particular method of psychotherapy."
1,Sorry I bought this book based on the good reviews,"I bought this book based on the other reviews I read. I was sadly dissapointed in this book. The premise is that one is blocked from working out because of energy in one's aura which must be cleared. Find someone to clear this block and you will be on your way to the body of your dreams. How untrue.First, I've been through that process in my past, and my workouts have never increased in frequency.Second, I was looking for advice on how to get started on a regime inspite of my less than perfect health. I did not find that basic instruction here, just psycho-babble.Of all the exercise, or spirtual for that matter, books I've read, this is the worst.....a real waste of time, money and hope."
5,A new way of looking at things...,"This book intrigued me. Of particular interest was the part about how thought-field therapy can be used to overcome UFO's. I also enjoyed learning about the use of pulse tests to identify food allergies, muscle tests to reveal underlying blocks, and acupressure points to eliminate cravings.This book had a playful tone at times, but mostly was very sincere. I especially liked (and could relate to) the chapter on ""Biochemical UFOs."" All in all, a good read."
5,A good book of general Soil Science,It's a good book for someone who has just started exploring Soil Science for it goes through all the aspects of soil from structure and hudraulics to fertility and pollution.
2,"A long way from their peak of ""Tattooed Beat Messiah""","Dark, moody music that sounds very little like early Zodiac Mindwarp. The great lyrics are still there, however the terrific, tongue in cheek slant has all but disappeared. The cd does grow on you after repeated listenings but never really rises above what has become known as ""Death Metal"". The cd is notable for one thing at least...Zody performs a ballad, ""Love Come Down"", which is surprisingly good! All in all, only for the true Zodiac Mindwarp or ""Death Metal"" fan...which at one time, were two different things."
2,what happened?,"As a long-time Zody fan, I had high hopes for this record. From the interesting title, cover and liner lyrics, it had the makings for a great blast of rock music. But, perhaps Zodiac was in the midst of a dark drug binge when he made this disappointing disc. Bad timing, for fans that waited and waited for a fine follow-up to 'Messiah'. Alas, Zody finally delivered with his latest effort ""I AM ROCK"" (buy it, now!!). This one is very dark, nearly suicidal, and the cheesy slant he threw on things before is gone. Perhaps that was by design. But, this one gets few listens although as a collector I own it. I think maybe he was lashing out at critics of the first album here, trying to prove he really IS psychotic. But all he did was confuse (and lose) fans. Luckily, Zody found himself again and you would do well to welcome him back with the new release. It is what 'One More KNife' SHOULD have been.-Pete"
3,"Lie down, Lie back, shut up, submit!","I agree one for only a true zoddy fan. Myself being one it, I find it a suitable final chapter to the Zodiac Mindwarp story. I am pleased that it's not a Tattooed Beat Messiah 2 and that the songs themselves are original and are experimental, clearly leading on from My Life Story - check out Cold Vertigo.My fav ones are Burn Down your Church, Set My Criminal Free (could've been on TBM) and One More Knife.5 stars to a zoddy fan otherwise it gets a 3."
4,The Marriage!,"This tape is worth the price, if only for the wedding for which we have all waited. Only Alice and the good Vicar could bring off an event like this. But wait - the final, single line will drag you to the next two tapes. We have yet to get this next series on our local public TV station. If you too are Vicar-deprived, spend the money. You will be rewarded. My only warning is that Alice gets a little preachy (?!) in the end ""jokes""."
4,inspires complete drawings,"I like this book because it shows the characters in a couple of different positions and with a background, so it gives the child an idea for a drawing that they can build on. Plus it's a little more advanced than children's drawings, but not in a different world like many of the how-to-draw books, so it fits in well with what an eight-year-old might draw naturally. There are eleven two page spreads: workman, angel, giant, pirate, queen and king, ballerina, soccer player, scuba diver, astronaut, parachutist, skier, ice skater and cowboy, then two pages of faces and three for a horse and rider."
2,Disappointed,"This book says it will teach you to draw people, and it will. The quality of the drawing however, leaves something to be desired. The drawings taught are not even close to realistic, and the techniques/practices are the type that will just teach your child bad habits if they ever want to pursue drawing more seriously. This book teaches you to draw stereotypically ""kid style"" drawings/people. Incredibly disappointed overall."
5,easy instructions with great results,"From the day my 5year old daughter got hold of this book and ""I can draw animals"" she is stuck with these. She completed 4 drawings at one sitting and always wants to do more. The best part is the simple visual instruction that shows the way without any adult supervision. Great book!"
3,"Good for Building Confidence, but Result Doesn't Approach Realism","This is a step-by-step guide to drawing very simple representations of different kinds of people: giants, workers, an angel, a ballerina. The instructions are very easy to follow, and the youngest artists will be gratified by their ability to imitate the pictures in the book. The book's main limitation is that the resulting pictures do not approach realism. This ought to be useful for building confidence in a hesitant artist, but it should be a short interim step to more realistic drawings (which may not be much more difficult)."
2,too general to help my trading,"This book is a collection of historical facts and author's observation of price reactions to news/events in treasury, commodity, and equity markets. As a trader, I was disappointed that the author didn't present any in-depth analysis or strategies for taking advantage of the many trading catalysts and the volatility they create. This book can be a good introductory material for people new to the market, but not for traders."
2,Not worth it,"We bought this for our son for Christmas. He loved it, but doesn't use it because it is really uncomfortable to wear. Bordering on painful. The straps are hard plastic that pinch and cut into your head. It's a neat idea, but needs a better design."
3,Not for under 6,"I got a pair for my 7 and 4 yr olds. they love the goggles! They have held up well for the past 5 months, with the exception of the darts. the darts broke the first day. they seem to love the goggles even without the darts! I would recommend this toy for 6 and up, probably less likely to break/loose the darts"
2,They hurt!,"The boys really enjoy the night vision but can only stand to have it on for a few minutes at a time because it's extremly uncomfortable!! We have had this toy for about 2 years now, so it is durable and entertaining ( or It would have been disposed a long time ago) But again it, is painful to wear and a bit on the heavy side."
5,Purple,"Turns a kind of muted purple when cooked. My kids love it, in fact the only brown rice they will eat. When I first got the packages I figured they would last a lifetime, now I assume I will be ordering more soon."
3,"Pricey, w/ Too Much Brown Rice","I expected this to be 100% wild rice, but more than half of it is regular brown rice. The quality is good, but it's not worth the price.Update: Since we bought this back in 2007, the product description has been updated to include brown rice. However, I still don't think it's worth the price. I find it cheaper to buy the 100% wild rice and brown rice seperately and then mix together."
3,"Very interesting, but don't base your faith on it","This is an extremely informative book, but there are several points that I don't necessarily agree with, such as the food laws (this book supports not eating pork or shell fish, etc. as taught in the Hebrew Bible), discounting Jesus' statement about how it is not what goes into a man's mouth that condemns him but what comes out. Much of it I already knew, so it was nice to get some source Scripture to support what I already knew. Overall I think everyone should read this book, but as with anything secular, take it with a grain of salt and do your research yourself."
4,"A Good Read, Even If I Disagree at Some Points","I like a book that challenges me, and this one did. Some things that I believe--such as the necessity of tithing--are called into question in this book, but most of the chapters I agreed with totally. The book goes after some cherished (and WRONG) notions about the Bible, such as that the fruit in Eden was an apple (we don't know what fruit it was), that Delilah gave Samson his haircut (someone else did!), that Christians should not drink alcohol (not true!), and so on. I really enjoyed the style, since it is not a ""heavy"" or academic type of book at all."
5,"Great CD and DVD even for those who don't understand Spanish, like me.","I reviewed another one of her CDs, so I am just saying the same thing, because it applies to this also, plus it includes a DVD of her singing live, which makes it even better! Here is what I said for the other review: I was flipping through tv channels on a Sunday I think, and I saw her on the Spanish channel doing a concert type thing... she is awesome, and I don't even understand Spanish except for a very, very few words, but even though I don't understand 99% of what she is saying/singing, it is simply just very good music! I bought almost all her music, and it is definitely worth it, and I recommend you do the same!"
1,"Just take a nice, long bath instead","For the price, I think it's simply not worth it.It kind of smelled nice at first... like a sauna at a spa maybe. But the scent went away when the product melted -- in about five minutes. I really didn't find any medicinal or therapeutic benefit at all.I would suggest instead taking a nice, long bath with all-natural bath salts."
2,LIke a stale 'alka-seltzer',"Not a lot of 'pop' to this hockey-puck, which is supposed to produce enough vapors at your feet to reach your nose and 'declog' your head...pretty weak, I could barely smell the product, even though it was 'breaking down' before my very eyes.I had the door to the bathroom closed as well...and the window. It got plenty steamy in there, but still no 'dramatic results'.I still have one unopened box...maybe I'll put them on 'eBay'."
1,URINAL CAKE is right!!!!,"You hit the nail right on the head. I was trying to figure out what that odor reminded me of. Toilet deodorizers. Has a faint scent of camphor, no menthol or eucalyptus.I used this today and was horribly disappointed. This thing did nothing. Great concept, extremely poor execution. They need to go back to the drawing board. It is hard to melt and has no vapors."
1,Imagine someone sucking on a cough drop and breathing gently in your direction,"When you put the tablet in the floor of the shower, there is a faint odor of menthol and eucalyptus. Imagine someone across the room sucking on a cough drop and breathing gently in your direction. That's about what you get here.WARNING. Don't use any scented shampoo or shower gel or you'll completely lose that soothing vapor. Oh wait, you lost it anyway.They're not even fun to watch dissolve."
1,Dud,"I read the previous two (positive) reviews and wondered if I used the same product.There was barely a scent to mine--actually it had a sort of Sani-Flush smell, quite a turn-off, and quite the disappointment when I was expecting aromatics.It wasn't because I was so congested that my sense of smell was diminished, because just minutes before using it, I had used a eucalyptus/spearmint hand soap which was much more aromatic than this tablet.I'm wondering if I got a ""dud"""
1,BEWARE . . .Don't eat it!!,"I received a free tablet in my Sudafed PE from Target. Suffering the symptoms of a cold, my vision was impaired. I just saw the word soothers and assumed it was for my mouth and nose. It has been three days and I am still sick to my stomach. BEWARE, this is not to be ingested. I thought they should have not put it in with a nasal decongestant pill box. I am very disappointed that they were not thinking of all the possibilitities.I spoke to poison control and they said the worst is over."
1,Terrible!!,"I suffer from allergies and have chronic congestion. Yesterday was a particularly bad day for me so I decided to purchase the 3 pack of Shower Soothers. I'm on a budget so spending $5 on a new product is not something I do all the time.I started my shower and got the water to a comfortable temperature. I dropped the Shower Soothers tablet onto the bottom of my shower. I stepped into the shower and in literally 45 seconds the entire thing dissolved and was gone down the drain!There were no vapors at all. Even though I'm congested, I can still smell and there was no smell of menthol or anything. And I surely didn't feel any tingling on my body like some advertisements claim.This product is a complete waste of money. You're better off making your own euchalyptus and menthol bath bombs and sitting in a hot bath for a while. It's probably cheaper, too."
1,Awful,"I wanted relief and was willing to try anything. I thought these tablets would provide temporary relief. I was wrong. The tablets are in the way during your shower and smell like a cleaner rather than a soothing effect.It's a waste of money, smells bad and provides no relief. Skip this purchase!"
3,Great Idea,"I saw this product reviewed in a woman's magazine, so thought I would try it for my chronic sinus problems. I don't think it did much for that, but think it would be very soothing and effective for one suffering with congestion caused by the common cold. I love the smell of eucalyptus, so I was not put off by the strong odor. I think that's the point anyway. I've never smelled a urinal cake, being a female, so I can't agree or disagree there, but I just thank the person who wrote that for the nice image. My only complaint would be that it does melt fairly quickly. I also think it is overpriced. I am saving the rest of mine for my next head cold."
5,ready to live,"Anam Cara is, in my opinion, the strongest band on strike first, with jesus wept and kingston falls tied for second. Pick up the album. The vocals are amazing, the lyrics are inspiring, and the drum work is even better."
1,Lame!,"I truly love nigahiga but if they werent really playing themselves in this movie, i have no idea what to say to the producer. It is not worth to buy this dvd. Do not waste your time cause i apparently did. You could watch them for free on youtube. Dont even bother. There was no plot, no storyline, and no humor. The worst movie ever seen."
3,Ok i guess,I watched it a few times it was pretty funnybut still it was a bite cheesy and a little lamei was disappointed i thought it would be funnierbut still its a good movie with some hilarious parts
2,extremely lackluster,"this book is a poor attempt to add variety to the series. no matter how animated i try to be, the fact that three nondistinct clouds change places at the sound of the ""magic drum"" is pretty insignificant to my two small children. if a book that captures all of that tubby charm is what you're looking for, this isn't it."
1,Don't waste your time,"I recaulked a walk-in shower, allowed the stuff to cure for 48 hours (instead of the 24 in the instructions) and the first time someone took a shower the caulk simply melted away. It had the consistency of marshmallow creme, got gaping holes in it, and I am sure has resulted in damage to the subfloor under the shower."
5,Good Western and a true story,I liked that the events that happen in the story true. It is fun to be along for the motion picture stunts that he does and his looking for jobs to be able to send money home to his mother. Just the odd jobs like making busts out of clay but being a cowboy at the same time.
2,Shortcomings,"The Very Best of Cashman & West is not the very best as only the single version of ""American City Suite"" is included. The album version had been the anthem for NYC in the seventies was, and still is, much thought of and appreciated. Both versions should have been included."
4,Great Talents,I agree with another reviewer in that the full length American City Suite should have been included. I also fell in love with these guys when I had them on 8-track with A Song or Two. I truly wished that album was available on CD. I have their seconf album on vinyl and have enjoyed hearing The Dutchman and the Tuna Fish Song for years.
5,great product,"works great, especially in the winter here in Maryland. Would purchase again if needed. Quality product made well. would suggest to a friend."
5,Excellent,"Bakker's post-post modern reconstruction of the classic epic (or epic fantasy) continues with this novel as the Holy War marches towards its destination echoing the real world crusades to a startling degree. Achamian faces new trials and tribulations before Cnaiur reveals the true enemy, Achamian explains their evil and simultaneously Kellhus' influence and power waxes in a truly biblical climax."
3,"Okay, but disappointing after the first","I picked up the Warrior Prophet from B&N; (sorry Amazon) because I could not wait for it to be delivered. I thought the first book was great, a very fresh read.The Warrior Prophet was pretty much the same old stuff, but not as fresh. As others have mentioned, the constant praising and adulation of Kellhus becomes very annoying and meaningless. Achamian is well enough, but there are several scenes that I face-palmed over something he did. I like the change that Esmenet goes through, and I noticed the sexually-themed tone of most of her chapters, but wasn't bothered by it.Up until the very end this book was 4 stars, however, the last battle outside of Carascand (or something like that), is absolutely ridiculous. Totally implausible. It's sad to say that I'll probably remember that chapter more than any other part of the book."
4,Top Notch,"Really, this title deserves four and a half stars, but I'm rounding down to make a stand against rating inflation. The Warrior Prophet is an incredible follow-up to Bakker's debut effort, The Darkness That Comes Before. Without question, this second book in the trilogy is better than the first, so if you find yourself getting bogged down in The Darkness, persevere! You've got a thought-provoking page-turner waiting for you on the other side. Finally, characters begin to acquire real depth; Bakker's imagined 'map' of The Darkness begins to seem quite like a world possessed of its own reality; and those pesky little made-up quotes that kick off each chapter seem more and more to be integrated into the story as the intellectual--and intellectually determinative--heritage of the characters, particularly Achamian."
5,Warrior Prophet,"The negative reviews of this book are definitely accurate in the facts. The world depicted is extremely dark and cold, and only a few of the characters are good. Hopelessness is pervasive throughout.That said, the writing is also fantastic and the depiction of the human struggle is cathartic and beautiful in its way. Nowhere have I read more exciting magical battles, and rarely so honest a depiction of the harshness of war and intolerance. I would be shocked to find that Mr. Bakker was anything other than a pacifist.I highly recommend this book."
2,The world is flat,After reading this book I have read well over a thousand pages of this series and even though I am always looking for a good read I find I do not want to read the third book. There are no characters to root for or get involved with because they are all really really bad people who become uninteresting in their one sidedness. Who cares if one of the main characters dies? They all deserve bad ends like the ones they have dished out in abundance. Averting an apocolypse? Could there be a worse society than the one these people have already created for themselves? Where are the women characters? They are prostitutes or so subordinate that it is grating to read and again boring. This author had a lot of potential but these books fall flat.
2,Well-written; too many atrocities for me,"I read the first two books in the trilogy; will not read the third. After awhile it palls to read a never-ending series of rapes, murders, and wholesale slaughters, including children thrown onto swordpoints or gang-raped to death in front of their parents. To be fair to the writer, I suspect he is using real-life descriptions from the crusades -- but in the end it was simply too sickening for me. Also: Every major character but one or possibly two (Achamian, maybe Esmenet) is a monster of one sort or another. In particular, the Prince-of-Nothing title character is technically human, but he is as vicious, manipulative, and alien as the ""Consult"" portrayed as the hidden enemy of humanity."
4,Complex story.,"This is the second book in the Prince of Nothing series. It is a complex book where just about everyone has a competing agenda for the Holy War.I think THE WARRIOR PROPHET is one of those books that either works for you or falls flat on its face. It isn't the kind of fantasy where you can blast through a bunch of pages with half your brain engaged. This book requires that you pay attention or you will be completely lost.For those of you who like that sort of thing (I'm one of them) this is a very rich world and the twists and turns keep happening. The author is not afraid of killing off characters (albeit some people keep coming back), and I think that is due to the author's belief in reality. He lets the story play out and if someone ends up as toast that's the way it is.Finally, this is a series that takes chances. You and I may not always agree with how the story evolves, but there are no short cuts being taken. The book proceeds logically based on the world created."
1,Don't waste your time.,"Terrible, agonizing book. I bought this one after the first book, because the first one was bad up until the last third or so. In fact this is one of the only books that I put down after only reading half.The long and short is that this book gets heavily into some made up religion. Characters are changing and super indecisive. The main character who has been super romantically involved with a woman finally uses his magic and it turns out that he has had man on man type relationships, which the author mentions in an off hand comment once. It was totally out of character.I must be way off base because others seem to love these books. Maybe they just have too much time invested to write a bad review. Either way I am used to great authors like Stephen King, Geroge RR Maritn, Jordan and other fantacy greats."
5,Great movie,"I liked this movies alot because of the complex and intricate way it told the story of a union, who time had come and gone. So often, like Harlan County, union stories are merely Us against Them with no middle ground. In this film, it is hard to determine who the heroes are-- those who crossed the picket line to feed their families or those who stood firm on principles and lost their jobs.There is probably only one villian-- Ray Rogers, whose self-promoting tactics cost the hard-working laborers who the film makes you love."
4,One brief shining moment known as Spam-a-lot,"This documentary provides a fascinating look at an era that was passing even when the documentary was made in 1989, and has since ended. The days of big companies, big labor and big clashes between the two. In this corner: the meatpackers union, fighting to get more for doing less; in the other corner, Hormel, fighting for just the opposite. Well, the status quo at least. The war -- one of attrition, lasting 15 rounds. The winner? You probably guessed."
5,Hilarious and touching,"These ""Vicar"" videos are the most hilarious things I've seen since Ab Fab. Take time out to experience Looney Land!!!!!!!!"
3,Mama Goose: A Latino Nursery Treasury,"I think it is a nice book, however I was disappointed. The title says "" A Latino Nursery Treasury"", the truth is that the content is 95% based on Mexican folklore. I wish the content included rymes and other pieces from other countries in Latin America: Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela, Cuba, etc...Most of the content is not knwon from people outside of Mexico."
3,Nice book!,"This book is really nice and illustrations are gorgeous. BUT It would be really helpful and cute if the tunes were printed out on the pages as well. I have to find out the tunes for most of the songs in order to make it fun for my little one. Also, I know a few of the songs/poems on the book and I noticed they have missing verses."
1,Book Not Shipped,"DO NOT ORDER THIS BOOK FROM AMAZON.COM. I ordered it 6 weeks ago from them, and it has yet to ship. Even though it still says IN STOCK and SHIPS WITHIN 24 HOURS, this book has not been shipped to me yet. I recommend looking at www.bn.com, where they ship very quickly."
4,Cool Propagandhi Comp.,"This is a great Propagandhi compilation of live songs, old stuff from 7 inches, and whatever. The amount of songs on this album also makes it a great buy. This album is not as good as How To Clean Everything, but comes very close. On a few live tracks the sound quality isn't perfect though."
4,good stuff going on here,"Thhis CD is very good, though not as good as their other two. This CD has some great songs such as ""White, Proud, and Stupid."" which was my favorite song for a very long time, and the remakes of ""The only good facist is a very dead facist,"" Which are really funny. But some of the sons on this CD are just flat out bad, and the recording is terrible on some of them. but that is only like 5 songs out of about 30, so, this CD is still worth getting"
3,"I love propagandhi, but,",some of these songs should have stayed on the 7 inches. Very rough mixes. Not the best but a must have for hardcore propagandhi fans.
4,For a classic flim buff what could be better than an early,"Hepburn/Tracy movie? Well this is one of their lesser efforts.Yes, it is not particularly funny most of the time (it does have its moments). If your not really interested in politics it may be dull & boring.This movie is about more than just entertainment. Frank Capra again has his honest every man, this time it's Spencer Tracy. This man, although he has a mistress, has a moral code that is corrupted, influenced by the lure of power. He is also amazingly naive. It is about a man, manipulated into negotiating away his values & integrity for that prize of power, in this case, the presidency. Without the usualKathrine/Spencer sparkle it still holds up. A young Angela Lanbury does a fine job as Tracy's ruthless & amoral girlfriend, the driving force behind the scenes. The issues this movie brings up & the politics of getting elected are still relevant today."
3,State of the Union,"I had never seen this movie and Chris Matthew mentioned it on Hardball, so I bought it. It was OK, for Political Junkies and worth the price. But a better buy would be The Last Harrah also staring Spencer Tracey."
4,"HEPBURN, SPENCER AND CAPRA, WHAT A GREAT TEAM.","""State Of The Union"" is an elegant movie about the politicians world and the media paraphernalia that usually surrounds them. The director Frank Capra combined very well comedy, drama and a smart screenplay, also, Capra always was surrounded with excellent actors, and ""State Of The Union"" is not an exception.The couple made by Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy has always been recognized as one of the best couples that appeared in the movies world, ""State Of The Union"" is another example of the elegance and finesse of these two great actors. Katharine Hepburn gave to her character intelligence, strength and passion, and Spencer Tracy gave another excellent performance as he usually did every time he appeared in a movie.""State Of The Union"" is at the same time an amusing and intelligent movie, it's recommendable for all the fans of Frank Capra, Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy."
4,State of the Union DVD,"Not my favorite Capra movie OR Tracy and Hepburn movie, but well worth watching because of the wonderful pairing of actors and director! Tracy and Hepburn are a magical pair no matter what movie they are in, and Frank Capra always has a happy ending even for difficult situations. This movie almost seems like a role reversal to Tracy and Hepburn's movie ""Woman of the Year"". Angela Lansbury did a wonderful job in the movie also."
2,Surprisingly unfunny,"I expected to enjoy this Tracy & Hepburn political comedy, especially since I'm a history buff of the 1948 campaign. Unfortunately, the politics is only window dressing for a lot of stagy banter and a plot that moved at a snail's pace. Tracy's character has been compared to Wendell Wilkie or Ross Perot, but to me he was a Clinton -- a big, charming, down-home guy trying without success to conceal a titanic ego. He had deserted Hepburn, playing his charming wife, and his two small children to take up with Angela Lansbury, at least 20 years his junior. Want to see a good political movie? Skip this turkey and seek out ""The Best Man"" instead."
4,A Nostalgia Trip,"If the sight of the hospital you were born in,the synagogue your family attended and the public schools you went to warm your heart this small book is for you. On the other hand, instead of pages and pages of Talmud Torah students we could have seen at least a minor reference to the Orthodox community and Rabbis or of the Jewish World weekly or Jewish holiday celebrations. And how can you make a book about Mpls without any pictures of the lakes we all loved?"
4,Submarine memories,"I am a retired Navy Submariner who now lives in New York. It was exciting to read about so many instances and details that had the realism only a fellow submariner could express, even down to the mannerisms and lingo. It is also apparent that the author has been to the places cited in the book. Once again, having been to the Puget Sound and San Diego, it brought back memories. The combination of submarine realism, location facts, and the weaving back and forth of the story line between different scenes and settings kept my interest, and kept me wanting to read more. Great book for a relaxing yet interesting read."
2,Knowledgeable but unmotivational,"I like these writers; they are reasonably efficient, for the genre, and are clear about what they intend without subterfuge. This book is an action thriller, meaning that while there are some mysterious elements to it, we the readers know the basics of its development and thus have the pleasure of watching characters adapt to it. Characters... well, they're a slight bit one dimensional, and the action somewhat linear, but the knowledge of submarining here is spectacular and is used to enhance our feeling of being there, of facing the actual threats of being submerged in the sea. For all its faults, I enjoyed this book, and were I its editor, would have demanded a more compelling and realistic plot and slightly tighter action. Still, of all the works in its genre, it's one of the least laughable and most pure entertainment value. I would recommend this book to other experienced readers in this genre."
2,S L O W,"Did not do it for me. Slow and rambling, boring, staid....yawn. The technical details were the light that provided at least some interest."
1,Hate Alert!,"So what's this book about? Well the author has done his research and his message is clear.""White man must be convinced of his right to be ""racist""......pg. 403 (course of action #2)I don't think I need to say anymore accept I'm so sorry the author profited off of my purchasing this book. I thought it was about the dangers of ignorance. In a way I suppose it is."
2,Not a good book for ATE,"It seems to me it is just a summary of work done by others inthe ATE field over the years. The explanations of how a devicefault is detected are not clear in most of the cases presentedin the book. The book emphasizes too much on faultmodeling but not enough on test applications and techniques.Certainly not a good text book for students nor itis a good book for ATE engineers. However, if you are lookingfor some quick reference, this book is a good place to startbecause it contains brief summaries of other people's work."
5,great cd case,It was just as expected. The CD case shipped quickly. It was sturdy and held CD's well. It was just the right size for what I needed.
4,Does the trick!,"You got CD's or DVD'd you need to store? This does the trick! Nice durable exterior, zipper is solid, pages hold the discs nice and tight!"
5,Really nice,I bought this because my CD cases take up so much room; i got this particularly for work because i needed the space; it is wonderful and safely holds my CD's; I also bought 1 smaller one that i keep for the CD's in my car. Definitely pleased.
5,Case Logic CSW-72 Capacity Sport CD Wallet,It was a great product to use. Wish it had been a little bit smaller or more compact so it would be easier to fit into my car. It is a great tool for those who have lots of CDs or DVDs that they like to keep stored.
3,Not bad for the money,"Not the quality that I would have expected from Case Logic. Inner sleeves are kind of flimsy, but functional.But then again, not bad for the money. If you want something simple that's not too expensive this will do the trick."
5,"Great case, great price!",Got this for my daughter and she loves it. The case is built well from a reputable company. Definitely recommend.
5,A True Legend in Our Time,"I first got onto the Legendary Stardust Cowboy back in the early '70's when I came acrossed the 45 recording of Paralyzed/Who's Knocking At My Door which was on Mercury records. It was so great that I went back and bought six more copies for my friends. Though his music is different, the power and intensity is unequalled in his style of music. The Ledge is truely a Legened in our time!"
2,Eh...,"I love raw and primative music. Hasil Adkins, the Shaggs, and the Monks all have treasured spots in my CD wallet. However, this has its moments but is just a bit too primative at times. It's funny every now and than and jaw dropping, but it's just a bit too incoherent. Seeing him live is probably a funner experiance than listening to him. Certainly weird and wild, but not really listenable. If you like the Ledge, you'll like this disc. If you find him to be incoherant and annoying, this will certainly not change your opinion. Not bad by all means, but theres so much better primative music out there you can listen to."
5,Grandpappy to Psychobilly Y'all!,"Got this totally on accident..and I gotta tell you..WOW! I mean we have all heard Johnny Cash's 'Ghost Riders in the Sky', but not quite like this my friends. Follow that up with 'Paralyzed' and you will be anything but, you'll want to dust off them boots and find the seediest[]bar you can!This is unreal, had no clue about the band or anything and though, gee, this is very psychobilly inn't? Well, shut my mouth...it's the GODFATHER of psychobilly y'all!Amazing flurry of steel guitars and a wailin' footstompin; good time...wish I'd been there! Here's the added bonus...a back up band consisting of Dead Kennedy members?Honestly, buy this....take it home, crack open a Lone star and cross over into this light becuase..truly, all are welcome.PSST...incidentally, this is where Bowie got his Ziggy persona idea...pass it on!YEE HAW!"
1,An inane little slogan for jingoistic people,"God, what a stupid bumpersticker. I;'ll probably be bought by people who are trying to cover up their having BUSH/CHENEY '04 stickers."
1,DoubleSpeak,">>>Basically, the second half of the bumpersticker reinforces the paranoid notion that foreign countries are chomping at the bit to invade us and force us to adopt their culture and speak their language. (With September 11th being used to ""prove"" that point.)The writer never heard of Pearl Harbor or thinks that 9/11 was such an attack or entertained the notion that soldiers prevent attacks, which is the point.>>Tapping into this primal fear is part the culture of fear-mongering propaganda that helps sell the notion ... <<of Global Warming.Oh that kind of fear mongering is OK."
1,Don't order this pen from Amazon!!!!!!!!!,"Just a warning that for this particular item, ""usually ships withing 1 to 2 weeks"" actually means, ""expect 'order delayed' e-mails for 6 months."" I finally bailed out since I have since graduated from college--and I needed the pen for a midterm!"
5,A unique contribution to web site measurement,"Hurol Inan has made a unique contribution to understanding the broad sweep of developments in web site measurement. The measurement framework he puts forward definitely ties together the real business and marketing principles with the internet technology. The metrics and analysis techniques introduced have enlightened me about the possibilities of what you can learn from the user activities on web sites.Measuring the Success of Your Website is informative, concise and easy to understand. Ideal for newcomers to the online environment and a fine checklist for existing online initiatives."
4,The Old Dinosaur Can Still Sing & Play,"Any new recording by Nick Soloman is cause for celebration. Why he isn't more popular and well known is beyond me. This new one isn't his best...my favorite is Valedictory Songs from a couple of years ago. Every song on that was great...Dinosaur's got a couple of tunes I could have done without. The recording is crisp, clean and all the better to hear Nick's lovely guitar playing. Still an essential purchase for us Bevis Frond fans."
5,Imak Computer Glove was a blessing,"The heel of my computer hand was so sore, I thought I might have to give up computer work. But this computer glove was such a blessing and it allowed me to continue to be able to work on the computer as a web designer, and gave my hand time to heal.I highly recommend this ergo glove!!"
5,What relief!!!,My new MAC is an evil machine that digs into my hand as I navigate the mouse and this glove provides relief.It is VERY helpful.
4,Suprised,"When I got this glove in the mail I looked at it and said ""This thing is supposed to make my hand feel better?"" It is small and simple in design. I have fairly long hands and the glove is a little tight to get on but fits very snugly. I use it on my left hand, and I was very surprised to find that it actually makes my hand feel a lot better. I use it all the time while at work on the keyboard, or at home while I play video games.I probably wouldn't recommend this for people with very large or significantly wide hands."
1,I have never written a review,"I have never written a review, but always find the reviews other people write extremely valuable. I injured my hand, I think the tendons weeks ago and needed some sort of brace. I ordered two different kinds, one more supportive and this one. There is no support with this glove, they should not use the word ""support"" in the description. The glove is too big, it feels like a sock is over your hand. Save your money and get a support with real support!"
2,Too lose to help,"I think this may be more useful for someone with larger hands than myself, I saw a review stating it was too tight... well for me it's the opposite.Too lose to be effective, no wrist support, slides around on my wrist. It's kind of like a pillow under my hand/wrist, which my mousepad already had, so it's kind of pointless."
4,khodge,Computer Glove w/ ergoBeads - Carpal Tunnel Relief]]I work with books and the computer at the same time. These versatile gloves make it easier to keep a proper angle with my keyboard and mouse. I think the next time I buy a type like this I will get the metal plate in it to assist better at reminding me of wrist positioning. I have found that using these glove has helped with the pain and numbness in my hands (onset of CTS). These are definitely worth the money if you have to have a multifunctional area to work in. I found I could wear the gloves while doing other task easily without having to take them on and off. They take a short time to get use to wearing.
3,It's okay,"I've been using this glove for a couple of weeks. Strangely, wearing it displaced the pain in my hand to my entire arm. I'm not sure if that's good or bad. Overall, it does seem to help some, and it might be a good preventative measure."
4,good gloves for typers,"gave these gloves to a friend (a small is still too big for my hands) who says that they have really helped with the pain in his hands. he's a computer guy, and wears them all the time when he is typing. quick delivery."
1,Not what I expected,"The brace doesn't fit me right at all. It is uncomfortable to use, and does not provide any support whatsoever."
1,Worthless,"Worthless. This product is too constrictive to wear for any length of time, which would be an issue if the brace actually did anything to relieve wrist strain."
2,"Needs some getting used to, but ok as a back up","I purchased these gloves, which are the fourth iMac product I've tried. The others are all well designed and helpful. This one ranks a 'fair'. It takes getting used to how tight they are, and they can make your wrists feel constricted. If that happens, I recommend you 'break them in' for a week or two. Once they stretch out, they're particularly good for protecting the notch between the hand and wrist, where lots of Repetitive Stress injuries hurt the most."
2,Didn't work so great for me.,"The idea for this might be good, but the glove is very loose and my wrist still hurts..."
3,"Good, but the wrist rest is better","I like the glove when I am sitting back with my wireless keyboard on my lap and a little table next to me, however, I found their wristrest product more comfortable when I am sitting at my desk. It cradles my wrist better and more comfortably. The glove doesn't allow the beads to move around my wrist as well. They are packed a little tighter. The drawback to the wristrest is that it's always falling off the edge of my desk or if I have it on any inclining keyboard/mouse tray. I used to use a gel rest but I am totally hooked on the ergo beads. I have them at home AND work. No matter which ergo bead product you use, you will never go back to anything else!"
4,I liked it but...,"I don't think it's appropriate for teens to read..especially in the early teens. While the book was an ok read for me (ahem a 30+ female lol) I don't think I would want my daughter reading about the teens in the book who were constantly drinking, drugging and partying. Not just amongst themselves but with ADULT men. Naked in a pool? No way. I would like to find out what happens next though."
4,Teen Nanny,"This book was about a girl named Adrienne Lewis and how her friend hooked her up for a nannying job for a super rich family in her apartment were she nannies. She gets the job as a nanny to an eight year old girl Emma who acts like shes thirty or something. Adrienne makes great money but is not prepared for some of the obstacles that face her way. She is forced to lie to her best friend and has started a wierd relationship with Emma's older sister taht forces her to lie to her mom. Can Adrienne keep her cool or will she lose her friends trust or more, her friend!I thought this book was very good. It was a fast read and it was very enjoyable. I myself have been a nanny, and some of the things that Adrienne had to deal with were kind of unbeleiveable and over the top how ever this book was still good. I would Recomend this book to teen girls that need to find a good book to read!"
4,nice read,"Another wonderful teen book.I thought this book was a fun read. Not too deep and you kind of have to hold your disbelief in some instances, but overall fun.The basic story of two girls who need money and work as teen nannies.I find the part about the set of parents a little over the top, but the rest of the story was so enjoyable that I found myself willing to overlooking them.Looking forward to more by the author."
3,Just okay.,"PB/Romance: Jack isn't too bright. He is training a race horse to run in the Kentucky Derby, in the desert. Really? Then he goes away from the training to help these idiots traipse across the desert to find the fountain of youth. The first Forbidden Tarot book was a page turner with a great heroine. This one is just okay. I wanted to shake Claire. She kept going off by herself and didn't stick with the other women until the middle of the book. Did she ever take into consideration that her brother wouldn't want her to sacrifice so much for his health; especially because there is no matching donor yet.I almost gave up at the beginning of the book so I skipped a few pages and got to where they started the trip. That was a lot better, but if you want to read a great trek, read Preston and Child's Thunderhead."
3,Was the book i wanted,Was the book i wanted alot of the pics was scribled out and alot more pages was ripped and some were taped back and some were repaired correctly. Overall i like the cause for which it was sold. I just feel it should of been described better.
3,I got mixed feelings and impressions,"I'm still reading this book and I haven't finished it yet. So far, it has been very informative and it has lots of illustrations. On the other hand, some examples shown are not that straightforward and I don't agree with the author in the usage of some of them. It is still a good introductory book on design for those of us without a formal background in art. As a crafts person, it still has value for me and so far, it is the best reference I've seen on design for craftsmen. This doesn't mean that it is an excellent book. It is so so..."
5,My morning lift!,"I'm afraid this gorgoeous book has replaced my daily morning devotionals! I look forward to my time with this visually stimulating ""work of art."" I am taking it very slowly as not to have these images and the dialogue run out too quickly.I'll be ready for a sequel very soon!"
1,garbage,First of all the adapter is made of cheap thin plastic and is easily damaged. i tried using the thing one time and the connection indicator light on it is already broken. but more importantly it doesn't work. it automatically sends signal from the d-pad down and right buttons. at first i thought it may have been my controllers so i picked up two brand new official nintendo controllers. still had the same problem. im going to try another adapter because i personally like the feel of having an original NES controller but at this point id suggest anything other then this product.
1,Not Smart Joy,"This is not a Smart Joy adapter. I received a generic knockoff that did not even function properly. The refund was painless, but do not think you will receive a Smart Joy that works."
5,Awesome product,"I purchased this a couple of weeks ago, after I started getting heavy into ROM's. I could not have asked for an easier to use product. Just plug it in, and configure the buttons, and you're ready to go. So far I've used it on SNES, NES, Genesis and even arcade games. You cannot go wrong with this one."
3,A Solid Effort!,"Change Your Attitude is rich with examples and interactive exercises for the reader. The authors do an excellent job of providing comic relief at regular intervals, some of which works. The active, participatory style of this book makes it more engaging than other books in the motivational genre. Much of this vitality comes from the impressive amount of research that went into it. The authors reference well over one hundred books, magazines, and newspaper articles, bringing readers a lively cross-section of ideas. The book's simple failing: Few of these ideas are new. Nevertheless, we at getAbstract recommend Change Your Attitude as an entertaining book that covers all of the motivational standards."
1,Old news,"It looked promising, but didn't live up to expectations. Rehashed ideas that have been around forever. Flashy, but mediocre."
5,the vicar,"this show is one of the funniest i have ever had the pleasure of watching. she displays great wit and humor toward a town of semi-brainless individuals, whom she identifies as the largest community of inbreds, and never once recognizes the fact that she herself fits in to the misfit community of Dibley. the other characters are played most convincingly by a supporting cast of qualified and talented people. do i recommend this show ""no,no,no,no,YES!!!!!!!"""
2,So-So,"Very short CD in terms of time. Didn't find the music ""rewarding"" either. The Musical Heritage Society LP I have from the 70's is much better."
5,Quistaday.....Rock on!,If this were a vinyl record...it would be melted already! I can't stop listening to this! Definitely a must-buy for all!
3,Gets off to a good start,"I've been working in Oakland for a few years and wanted a taste of Reed's writing since I only recently heard of him. It's good stuff but rambles a bit. Reed throws a lot of disparate elements together in each of his pieces, so you kinda forget what the one you're reading is supposed to be about. There's also no shortage of anger in here, and precious little humor to catch your breath on. I got about one-third of the way through it before I needed to move on, but I still feel it was worth the price of entry."
5,Oh yea,"Well, you just gotta love this guys voice. The actual reason I bought this CD was to get the song ""Seattle."""
4,Shows great but product needs work,"First season 4 skipped. There are several episodes missing in season 5 and I tried to buy ""The Last LETTERS"" episode but another episode loaded instead. I feel cheated. Amazon needs to work out the bugs."
1,Very sad Shout is Cheap!,"Very sad that Shout is very cheap. So cheap they will not put Closed Caption on the Disc..Yes it may cost them a few bucks to do it. But they could get all kinds of people that are Hard of hearing to buy them.And I see Shout pulled a fast one with Route 66 TV show they put out. Had people buy the complet show, and not just put out season 4. Real smart Shout!And all the B.S. you said you were doing to it. When in Fact you did Zip Zero.Again Shout is Cheap and a rip off."
2,not my cup of Hip Hop,"I'm not impressed with Khaled at all. I can't stand hearing him yell, with his annoying shrill, over every track. ""We the best *****"". WACK."
4,Underrated and Put Aside,Better than the Ratings! Sooo many songs to bang too! I Can put this in my Cd player and ALMOST let it play through! MUCH BETTER THAN HIS FIRST Album Lisssssten! Trust Me! Worth ur Money! Good Rappers ALL over it!
3,Decent Album,"This cd was worth the money. It has some good joints on it, but it could have been better."
2,Not So The Best,"Although there are a couple tracks on this CD that area ""listen"" worthy, DJ Khaled's over zealous way of getting on each and every track by screaming ""We The Best"" every five seconds gets highly annoying after the first couple tracks. The artist hold this CD together..not the beats or the DJ!!"
5,Spiritually uplifting and educational too.,"The most amazing scenes are the seamless time lapse photography, especially the scene of the mother going from 0-9 months in about 2 minutes. The scientific narration is not dull and actually brings out the truly miraculous and spiritual nature of bringing a new life into the world."
3,good for those who are new to the experience,"This is a good ""starter"" video for those who want an in-depth of the ""how's"" of the pregnancy process; but there are better videos out there (see BIRTH DAY).And for the record, regarding the review which said ""seems to be among the very rare women who are able to give birth without the aid of forceps or an episiotomy."" This is ENTIRELY untrue. Many, many, many women give birth without the aid of forceps or an episiotomy. The reason that they are so often used in this country is that the medical profession rushes the labor process, and doesn't allow a woman's body to do what it needs to do, which negates the need for such medical interventions. Watch Birth Day (or call a doula and ask) if you'd like more information. :)"
4,I wish there were more like this one.....,"In America, they always try to scare you with horror stories about birth and how ""safe"" an epidural is (even though it is a drug, it does pass through the placenta, and it can cause your baby to be irritable for up to six weeks). In America, they need to show more videos like this one. Check out some other great books like Immaculate Deception by Suzanne Arms, and Ina May's Midwifery book. It truly makes me cry...the things they do to moms and babies in America."
5,My Favorite CD- and trust me I have many.,I would rate this CD higher than 5 stars if I could! It is my favorite cd and I listen to every single song on it equally! All are amazing! I feel like I could fall into the sky and just listen to it if that even makes sense! While I was in Japan I promoted Acceptance and everyone I let listen to it thought it was amazing. I would buy this cd all over again just to prove how much I love it! If you don't buy it you are missing out on my personal favorite cd...and some of the best songs I have ever heard in my life!
4,Phantoms CD,"AWESOME ALBUM. Definitely turn of the century classic. One of my favorites growing up. So catchy, heartfelt, and well produced"
3,Not a perfect replacement.,"For 1988 Ford F150 Lariat. The bent sheet metal did not match the original as well, so the door wouldn't close properly. I switched the sheet metal part from the old to the new bolt and now the doors close like new."
5,Great Guitar and Vocal,"I discovered Mark the other night at a concert featuring Warren Hill and Jeff Golub. Mark was backing them up so I didn't get to hear him sing but he did play a great guitar so I bought his CD after the show. Listened to it the next day and was very surprised at what a great voice he has as well (very sexy). There are several great cuts on the CD. ""Island Sail"" and ""Forest Flower"" are my favorites but I also really like the title cut ""More Than Friends"" and ""Austin Lullabye"" was a very pleasant surprise (I was expecting something sort of country). The more I listen the better I like this whole album and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys nice smooth romantic jazz. An excellent find!!!"
4,HOLD ON A MINUTE!,"A CHOICE OF ENEMIES was Higgins' favorite novel but not mine.The first chapter is incoherent babble until after you read the rest of the book, then it makes sense. But I was ready to drop the lifeboats and make my escape through all of chapter One. Chapter TWO is excellent and gave my courage.Higgins' dialogue is superb and the story is excellent but the book lacks adequate structure and cohesion to do its best. It reminds me of doughball bait that wont hold together in the water. It reminds me of a nifty toy that comes with bad instructions.I think COGAN'S TRADE is his best novel, but A CHOICE OF ENEMIES is worth your time."
4,Rattle in Vienna - Fresh Beethoven,"The Gramophone reviewer was less than enthusiastic about this release. Granted, there are occasional ensemble problems and unusual balances. But this is the most exciting Beethoven I've heard in years. The recordings are clean, the sound is nothing like what we've come to expect in Vienna: lean, edgy, almost, but not quite like the period instruments in Norrington's and Gardiner's recent sets. But Rattle's radical re-imagining of the sound world of the early 19th century and the particular choices he makes make these renditions stand apart. Thrilling playing, convincing tempi, glorious sound. Get it."
2,Look elsewhere,"Of all the Beethoven cycles the Vienna Philharmonic has recorded this is surely the less well done and the less interesting. I still can?t understand why the Berlin Philharmonic elected this young and not terribly talented conductor. If you want all the symphonies in a cycle look for Harnoncourt, Blomstedt or Masur with the Gewandhaus orchestra. Leave this alone."
2,not worth the money,The product in my opinion was a little small for the price it was nothing more than a sample not worht the money at all.
5,brilliant,"to say this is hands down the best software simulation of a classic analog synth hardly does it justice. this is the only software simulation out there that nails the original to the t. beautiful job capturing the goldface odyssey with the 24 moog ""like"" filter. not near as flexible as other softies, no special effects and even the patch save is a bit awkward. no matter. this is sonically superior."
1,Ener_G Baking Powder (Sodium Free,"This product has more, but not twice as much in the container, however you must use twice as much as other brands of sodium free baking powder when you bake with this brand. This makes it cost twice as much to use. I would not have bought it if I had known that I had to use twice as much of the product. This product should have stated the fact that recipes needed twice as much of this product as you do other Sodium Free Baking Powder. I WILL NOT BUY AGAINAmazon Verified Review"
3,More cartoony than I would have like,"Overall, I thought this anime series was good but More cartoony than I would have like. It ran the spectrum from being rated G in places to PG-13 in others. Because of some alcohol use in a couple of the early scenes, it would be tough for a G-rated crowd and the story line is certainly more PG-13. However, for outer space combat and adventure, I recommend it."
4,I had to buy this show!,"After renting the first several volumes of Lost Universe, I discovered that the video store didn't have the last half of the show! The plot line is so strangely gripping (watch the show and you'll know why it's strange to call it ""gripping"") that I had to know what happens. I had nearly given up on it when I found it here! This weekend, I'll find out how it ends . . . If you're reading this, you should buy it too, before you end up wishing you had. Plus, it works just fine, came in perfect condition, shipped in no time, and shipping was free! What more could you ask for? After all, it is ""the best in the universe!"""
2,Bought it cheep and got a cheep return.....,"Well.. what can I write about? The dubbing, I believe but won't spare the research, was made for television broadcasting. The Japanese subtitling made Far more sense than the English voices. I never heard the voice actor of the female ship again and I'm grateful for it. Running nails across a blackboard is the only fair description. The story was fairly silly in the original Japanese and I'll be stopping near the beginning and restart with it in Japanese to judge the quality of the show at a later date. Purchase at your own peril."
4,Wonderful book and prayers are awesome prayers,Ive read like about 50 pages of the book and so far im enjoying this book .Its helping me along my journey with learning how to pray things im doing in my life that i need to change.It has alot of good points versus stories and prayers.I would recommend.Fast shipping the book was in great condition.I feel like its helping me become closer to god by showing me things i could appreciate more and how to do things better in my life to please god.Well I will send more information later on the book when im almost finished so far a great book.
5,Brilliant,"Highly recommended. Nice, compact size fits easily in a purse or tote. Each chapter is a little essay, and only takes a few minutes to read. The very first chapter was like a light bulb went off over my head. I love this one."
4,Easy to read,"Each short section has a unique insight, it doesn't take a long time to do each day's section. Encouraging to new believers."
5,"Battlefield of the Mind, an amazing encouragement for life","This devotional has been a huge encouragement to me, my mother, grandmother, aunt and cousin, not to mention some of my friends. I recommend this book to anyone, Christian or not, charismatic or not. It gives keen insight into the way one's thoughts influence his/her emotions. As thinking people, we can choose our thoughts, which, in turn, influence our emotional stability and peace. This devotional teaches an awareness of one's thought life."
4,Battlefield of the Mind Devotional (Book),Enjoy Joyce Meyer as an author and speaker. The book gave me a lot food for thought. It is a book I go back to for guidance.
4,Let there be light,These lights were a final touch to our kitchen remodel. My husband installed them (through a bit of trial and error) and they look good. Our only complaint is that the light given off shows the holes from the open sides of each light rather than one consistent light from each. All in all we think the addition will help increase the value when we're ready to sell.
4,Works great,"These are really nice lights. They do get a little warm, so make sure you don't leave the sugar or chocolate on the bottom shelf of your cabinets. Nice natural light. Recommend purchasing the dimmer touch pad.The connectors for the pods are crimped to the wire at specific lengths. In my case, I had to relocate and solder every connector because i wanted the wires routed through the cabinets. Not a problem if you're good with electrical work."
4,Nice product,This cleansing cream is great for normal to dry skin. You only need a small amount of product so this bottle should last me a long time. Smells clean and does not leave skin feeling dry. I would recommend this product to others.
5,COMPLETELY ORIGINAL!!,"I honestly had started to lose hope in finding a new artist with some originality. Imogen has saved me, and restored my faith in the truly gifted artist!"
1,Pale Sarah McLachlan imitation,"Weak vocals, songs that seem to go nowhere, and irritating arrangements. Try Frou Frou instead."
5,Last days of the civil war,Arrived in a timely fashion. Was in excellent condition. enjoyed by the whole family
5,Excellent Product,"The product is very pricey, but worth it. I have very sensitive skin and any little pimple I get will leave a mark if I mess with it. Thus I've been using murad combined with the Proactive regime for over a year now and have beautiful skin and I am acne free too. This product left my skin so radiant looking with a clear and even skin tone that I no longer wear foundation. I am complimented on my skin all the time. I can feel the difference in my skin minutes after using this cream. It's much better than the other sticky serums that have the vitamin c in them. Murad also adds a few more indgredients such as retinol that accounts for the high price, but it's worth it."
5,Worth the expense.,I use several Murad products. I recently purchased the Essential-C Renewal Complex. It's pricey but worth it. It feels like velvet on my skin.
2,It was just okay,"I didn't see much change in my skin. I am Asian with combination skin. When I used it, the next morning I would need to apply extra moisturizer as the cream itself isn't enough. So maybe it will work for other skin types? For the price, I will not buy it again."
