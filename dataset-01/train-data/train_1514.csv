4,My 8-year-old can't live without this,"Annie's Mac & Cheese is my youngest son's favorite lunch. As my older boy can't have cheese, the microwave packets make the perfect amount."
1,Hated it ...,"Just hated this mac and cheese. So artificial, yuck and made me sick in the stomach. I bought a whole lot and could not eat more than two packs. Gave away some to friends and neighbor kids and everyone hated it. Worst mac and cheese ever. Look at the ingredients and calories - not healthy either. I simply wasted my money."
4,Portions are just a little small,"I love the convenience of only having to add water. I had ordered these for my 4yr old and he loves it. I am surprised though that even for a small child, one prepared packet leaves him asking for more, but making two packets results in some not eaten. Overall excellent flavor and quality."
5,"Two 1970s ""Soul Essentials"" now on one CD.","These two albums were unquestionably ""essential"" for any real or serious R&B or Soul fan when originally released in 1977 and 1978 --so it's good to have them available on one CD today. Teddy Pendergrass was one of the 1970s most important and influential male R&B vocalists and he became a solo superstar in his own right thanks to such hits as ""I Don't Love You Anymore"", ""The Whole Town's Laughing At Me"", ""You Can't Hide From Yourself"", ""Close The Door"" and ""When Somebody Loves You Back"". While these two masterpieces have been available separately here in the U.S. for many years now this U.K. import CD offers you the two albums on one disc PLUS much better sound quality."
2,Don't waste your money...,"I ordered these as an anniversary gift for my husband, because I thought the message was great, and it seemed like the perfect gift. However, I agree with the other reviewer: they are not nearly as cute as they appear. They are small, and the printed message is of such poor quality that I cannot imagine that it will survive even a few washings. The price is ridiculous for what you (don't) get. The only reason that I did not return them was because I still wanted a funny ""daddy"" present for my husband, and it was a bit late to find an alternative. I gave it to him almost apologetically. Save your money..."
2,Not functional,"This product is very cute and I really liked them, but they really didn't work all that well. They were very expensive also. I wouldn't buy them again. But I was happy I bought them. I gave them as a gift to my husband at our baby shower. I like the sentiment."
3,It took him nearly a lifetime,"Robert MacNeil struggles nearly a lifetime with the idea of becoming an American citizen, all the while enjoying the benefits of residing in Canada, Britain, and the United States. It takes a horrendous disaster, 9/11/01, to make him realize that Americans are good people, after all, and he is one of them. His book conveys a coldness about himself, perhaps characteristic of Canada, an absence of emotion about his life apart from his career, for which he holds great driving ambition. His career is truly exciting to read about, and one can see how submerged he was in it, perhaps too much, to focus on which country was right for him."
5,Very Good - Needs Rhyming Dictionary,"This book does an excellent job of explaining the types of rhymes available to songwriters. How to choose the appropriate rhyme, and where to find it in a rhyming dictionary. I have had no previous experience in lyric writing or poetry and it was very easy reading, yet there is enough depth to last a very long time. You will need a rhyming dictionary for the exercises in this book, Pattison recommends 'The Complete Rhyming Dictionary' by Clement Wood. Overall this book is excellent for beginners, with enough content to assist more advanced lyricists."
3,Very general info,"This book covers the very basic ""rules"" of rhyming.If you've written more than a couple of poems or songs, you probably won't get a lot out of this book.That being said, if you are brand new to songwriting this might be helpful to get you started.The book does set a foundation for those that have never taken a literature class or writing class."
5,A Must Read,The protocol presented in this book is the first treatment for fibromyalgia that focuses on reversing the condition rather than simply treating symptoms. A must read for those suffering from this disease.
5,"If you want your life back, this is the book to read!","R. Paul St. Amand, M.D. and Claudia Marek paint an accurate picture of what it is like to have fibromyalgia and then proceed to lay out a blueprint of how to reverse this terrible disease. If you are willing to follow the blueprint with no compromises, and are willing to be patient, you too can regain your life as thousands of us already have.This book is a ""must-read"" for anyone who has fibromyalgia."
5,Feelin' Good Thanks to Dr. St. Amand & Claudia Marek,"I'm forever indebted to the friend who recommended this book. It covers every question with a clear, concise, and logical answer. Charts, lists, explanations, and a logical progression of subject matter make it an invaluable reference guide to anyone suffering with Fibromyalgia. Both of the authors, along with thousands of their patients suffered from this debilitating disease and are now leading normal pain free lives. There is no cure as yet, but thankfully there is this book and guaifenesin to help us."
3,It's confusing in parts but I'm reading over some of it again.,I'm not sure a cold medicine can reverse Fibro but if that's true then I'm all for it. This would be a big breakthrough for studies in other types of illnesses such as this.
2,The book is well-written but the remedy is snake oil...,"I followed Dr. Paul Amand's fibromyalgia treatment plan for a year and it did nothing to alleviate the intense muscle pain. I was outraged at the notion that an ingredient in cough syrup (Guaffenisen) can cure people of FM. Perhaps some believing sould have been cured, and thank God for their healing, but for me it was just one more book touting the awesome curative powers of snake oil. Spend your money on a deep-muscle massage or a nice dinner our with friends or family."
2,sugar pill,My neuro. tells me that this is nothing more than if I applied a sugar pill. It has no true effect on fibro. nor reversing it. It is the placebo of wanting it to help that makes it work. JMHO.
1,Not credible,"I first was excited about this book, but as I read more and more I realized how flawed the theories being proposed were. I cannot believe that this treatment will work at all. I have cycles even without using this treatment and also have gotten better by taking recommended supplements, exercise and sleep program giving in the book 'reversing fibromyalgia' by Joe M. Elrod. I feel this is a much more realistic book than this quack book about this guai medication..."
4,Very interesting!!,"This book is based on treatment of fibromyalgia with Guaifenesin. Very interesting but also very technical. Unless you have medical background this book is difficult to understand the concept of how the guaifenesin works. And treatment of fibromyalgia with guaifenesin requires avoidance of many, many, many products and food for proper results. A good book to forward to your doctor."
5,getting started,"Just getting started,,,,excited,,,,,the book sounds so reasonable,,,can't wait to give it my all,,,,nothing else has ever worked,,,,,,,this just might,,,,,,,"
1,did not work for me,"I tried the guai protocol for months and it did not help me. I did everything I could to follow the plan exactly. Still did not work for me. I quit because I missed chewing gum and eating sugar free mints. I mean, weight is also a problem with most that have fibromyalgia and the gum and mints keep me from eating. So, just wanted everyone to realize that, even after months of altering my lifestyle, this does not work for everyone!"
2,"No proof it works, except you do get worse at first.","It is a great theory but I think phosphate retention is a symptom and thus, this does not cure the disease in many people. I know people taking this for years that still hurt like hell. If you catch it early, like childhood, then you may have better success. For me, the cycling symptoms get too severe to handle and thus, I never clear. Dr St. Amand, however, is a nice guy and really believes in this. I just wish I saw more proof of remission, which I haven't."
5,The Definitive Treatment,"Dr. St. Amand offers real hope and real treatment for this mystery disease. His book is easy to understand and follow. I am on the treatment and already see results! Thank you, Dr. St. Amand. You have changed my life."
5,The Easiest and Most Sensible Explaination of Fibromyalgia,"I suffered from pain and fatigue for most of my life. After 20 years of making the rounds of dozens of doctors, I was finally given a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Then I was told, no one knew what it was, what caused it or how to treat it. The only solution was to treat the symptoms, and only then if you could find a doctor willing to give you the drugs to make life bearable.Then I read Dr. St. Amand's book, and knew my instincts had been right all along. There was something in my body, actually causing this pain, and it was getting progressively worse. This is the most logical explaintion I have seen.I have been on this protocol for 6 months and feel better that I have in several years. I can now look forward to a pain free future. This is a must read for everyone with fibromyalgia and their families."
5,MEDICAL WORLD SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO REMAIN IGNORANT.,"This book saved my life. It's as simple as that. I'm 59 yrs old. Looking back, I've had fibro for at least 15 years. Dr's said I had neuritis, neuralgia, tendinitis. And there's no question my mind was going. I couldn't think, couldn't focus, couldn't remember. Three years ago I got a headache behind my right eye that lasted 24/7, for eight months, accompanied by sciatic nerve spasms that made me want to die. That's when I was diagnosed with fibro, with no cure. I insisted there had to be an answer. Dr. said I was in denial, and would have to learn to live with it. Could not work; had to sell my house to pay bills. Then maxed out the credit cards. I was so scared. Then a friend told me about the book. I started on guaifenesin Dec. 20,00. It costs 20 cents a day. Every week I gain more good hours and expect to be back at work in a couple of months. I tell everyone I know about Dr. St. Amand, and make them promise to pass the info along."
2,An interesting theory that is impossible to follow,"St. Armand's theory is interesting, and he certainly seems to have done his research, BUT - and this is a really big one - to follow his protocol, as outlined in this book, would be next to impossible for most people. He rules out the use of so many common items, that I could never imagine actually LIVING. I might as well lock myself in a closet for the rest of my life."
2,Doesn't Work for Everyone,I followed the dietary procedures and the Guaifenesin treatment to the letter for almost two years. The diet is basically the Atkins Diet and this did the most good for me. The Guaifenesin did nothing to improve my symptoms. I did everything the books says. I WANTED it to work! But it didn't. I just wanted you to know that it doesn't work for everyone. I believe you should know this going in and avoid beating yourself up like I did because it isn't working.
3,Neither a cure nor a sugar pill.,"Guaifenesin is neither a cure nor a placebo. Guaifenesin is drug that has neurological properties, which the medical literature documents, but Dr. St. Amand refuses to believe is relevant. His recommendation for trying a hypoglycemic diet is useful, and it's worth trying guaifenesin. But otherwise, don't put your faith into this therapy being a cure for fibromyalgia (he doesn't even diagnose fibromyalgia the way that other people do, i.e. using the tender point exam)..."
1,Nutrition QUackery,"Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) should not be treated by a low carbohydrate diet. Hypoglycaemia should be treated by regular meals and snacks (ie every 2-3 hours throughout the day), containing adequate carbohydrate of low glycaemic index variety. Low glycaemic index carbohydrates are slowly digested into glucose which is then slowly absorbed into the bloodstream for sustained energy. Low glycaemic index (or low GI Factor) carbohydrates also assist with weight control and satiety. I recommend ""The GI Factor - The Glucose Revolution"" by Assoc Prof Jennie Brand Miller et al."
3,Outdated material,I read this book when it first came out approx. 10 years ago. It changed my life for the better. Since then much more information has been learned but Dr St Amand has refused to update his material. The basic theory behind his protocol has remained the same but he refuses to alter from his outdated treatment methods. I highly recomend this book but caution people to learn the full scope of this protocol that is evolving independently of Dr St Amand.
1,Would be great if it worked,"My wife bought this book some years ago when she was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. Since we both have medical backgrounds, we were intrigued at the protocol and the science offered by the author. We tried it and it didn't work at all for my wife. Then we started cutting out all of the foods that supposedly ""interfered"" with the protocol, and still no luck at all.It amazes me that there are so many positive reviews on Amazon, because of dozens of people I've known who tried this, it didn't work for any of them. All the same, if this really helps some people then great for them - I certainly want information to be available to everyone.I'd strongly suggest for those with Fibromyalgia (and who are willing to think ""outside the box"") the excellent book by Jacob Teitelbaum, ""From Fatigued to Fantastic."" His book is excellent."
5,"Not just coping, but true healing","This book is a unique diamond in the rough. I have read many many books and seen many doctors about Fibromyalgia, health, digestive disorders, endocrine disorders, psychological disorders and on and on. This book offers hope where others only offer coping. Dr. St. Amand is a kind, lovely, humble, compassionate mainstream M.D., and not a quack at all. Also Fibromyalgia is much more than the AMA's definition and is estimated to plague 40% of women in the US, and lots of men. i was skeptical until I read it and met Dr. St. Amand. Do yourself a favor, get some hope."
5,Gave me back my life,"If it hadn't been for Dr. St.Amand's book I would still be flat on my back on the couch. I am now an active, 58 year old wife, mother and grandmother of 4. It has given me my life back. I have been on guaifenesin for 3 and 1/2 years, and don't get me wrong, it hasn't been easy. My doctor wasn't sure at first because she hated to see me hang my hat on something that wasn't proven by the medical society. I told her to give me a place to hang my hat and I would. Well, she's singing a different song now!"
5,Excellent method for dealing with this disease-not a cure,"Some folks have written reviews that their doctors have told them this is nothing more than a sugar pill and is only effective due to the placebo effect-while at the same time offering nothing more to help their patients. Well, the placebo effect will wear off in about 6 months, according to studies. Many folks that follow the protocol to the letter, including my wife, have benefited from this book and treatment. It is not a cure but an effective means to keep it in check. Proof is in the puddin', I got my lovely wife back and that's all that matters."
3,Difficult to test,"This is a well written book, and Dr. Amand is evidently a kind and caring doctor who knows a great deal about his field. He gives a lot of excellent advice.I think that for most sufferers it would be hard to exactly follow the regimen he recommends. That makes it difficult to completely test his methods. Apart from taking guaifenesin, he recommends the complete elimination of all sources of salicylates, including not only aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) but many other common products. In addition he considers many people to have hypoglycemia, even if their blood tests are normal, and this means an even stricter diet."
2,Wasted my money !,"Gave a lot of statistics that really didn't mean a lot to me. Last 1/4 of the book had some information, but still didn't answer a lot of my questions. Wasted my money !"
1,Don't waste your money.,"Before you think about buying this book, visit the Fibromyalgia Network web site and search on this author's name. They will explain there is no independent clinical trial supporting this theory and this treatment. Unfortunately, I bought the book before I did my research because I'm always thinking there is some kind of non-traditional treatment that will help with my FMS. I only read through 2 chapters before I realized I had been ripped off and I threw it away. I can't believe there are no many positive reviews of this book. If this treatment really helped all of you, then that's wonderful."
1,Worthless,"This book is a waste of time and money. I bought it thinking WOW something that can really help me with my fibro pain and all it did was make the problem and the pain worse instead of better, when I talked to two of my fibro docs (who only treat fibro patients mind you) they both said it is a farse and there is no proven facts that it will work or does work and that they have more patients that are worse after having tried this. Don't waste your money like I did."
1,A Joke,"This peocol has scientifically been proven not to work. They need to change the books description to include that it is all about this drug, because if I would have known this I wouldn't have bought it. The protocol is a joke."
1,Guaifenesin protocol debunked years ago,"Guaifenesin doesn't work - it never did. The theoretical basis for the treatment is based on a false premise - that FMS is an ""auto-immune"" disease, and you need to detox. Well, guess what. It's not, and never was.FMS is a neurological disease and Guaifenesin is just another placebo.I know hundreds of people with FMS, and I don't know anyone ""cured"" or even helped by this protocol - not that many can actually follow it."
4,What your Dr doesn't tell you-book,Book shipped reasonable time. Book was good quality and very informative on the subject of Fibromyalgia and what Doctors won't talk about.
3,Pretty good but...,"This game is pretty fun when you first get it but after a while it gets a little boring but it is but still entertaining strangely.For some reason I am scared of parts of it but I close my eyes and cover my ears and I am fine.There is no blood in this game but I do not recomend this for [...] year olds but [...] year olds might not be scared of this game.You can play 1 on 1,multi player,and missions.I hope I helped you make your choice."
5,Great Movie,Any movie with Sean Connery is amazing. The plot twists and turns are great and the views aren't bad either
4,Pretty Good,"If Beyonce heard this album, I know she'd be impressed with the amazing job and effort that was put into it. All the songs were redone beautifully. One song in particular stands out-""Crazy In Love."" ""Crazy In Love"" is one of my favorite songs by Beyonce, and on this album, it sounds fantastic!Even the songs by Destiny's Child that were put on the album sound great! Any Beyonce and/or Destiny's Child fan shouldn't be without this album."
1,Lots of bad advice,"We returned from Italy yesterday & had disappointing experiences when we relied on the Frommer's guide. Restaurants were bad, shops were described inaccurately with poor directions, and, in general, descriptions were too positive. Other guides (Fodor's, Lonely Planet, & Time Out) provided much more objective information."
4,A pleasant overnight read,"Magnus (Earl of Rutherford) is in his 30's, unmarried and is told he has an uncurable heart condition that will kill him within the year. He wants an heir in a hurry. Cara needs money for her penniless mother and younger brother who needs expensive treatments for his consumption. Magnus provides the money Cara needs, though he doesn't know why she needs it, and she tries to provide the heir. This is a sweet story with both people fearing to share all their secrets. I enjoyed seeing how the two resolved their problems and fears. This is not a deep philosophical book, but it is a nice one night diversion."
3,"Louvin Brothers, The Family who prays","A part of their Capitol 8-CDs integrale (Bear Family Records), for fans and family who prays."
2,So-So.,"Christmas Every Day was written by Marie Ferrarella and is about a guy named Nik Sinclair and a whiney lady named Sara Santangelo who has a major chip on her shoulder and is just too annoying! The book was so-so, I just didn't really enjoy it, I prefer a Christmas romance book to be happy and joyful not depressing like this one!"
1,Shockingly Bad!,"I can't believe anyone would read this novel and actually give it five stars, or four, or three, or even two. These must be readers who have never read anything good before. This may have been one of the worst novels I've read in my life. The prose is okay, the story stinks and it is more boring to read than you could possibly imagine. I would highly recommend watching Nick at Night before reading this novel - you'll get more out of it and be semi-entertained for at least 5 mintues of your day."
5,"Quick shipping,awesome read.","I saw the author in person and loved his presentation on ""forgiveness"". If you are one that isquestioning your Catholic faith, or you are interested in becoming Catholic then this is an inspiring book."
5,Summer Vacation,"My daughter had the 1st grade Summer vacation book. She loved it. I ordered her the 2nd grade book through her school and never recieved it. I am hopeing that someone will reply to this e-mail. I am having trouble getting through to anyone to help me. I am disappointed and they did cash my check. Anyone with a phone number, I would be so greatful.Gretchen Rossman"
2,Mediocre text,I had to use this book for a public speaking class and found it to be quite tiring to get through. Its few good ideas and suggestions are easily lost within its high-school approach and broad conjectures about communication.
4,Keep it Clean,"The California Car Duster offers a simple solution to a big problem. Your car can never be clean enough, but it is important to note that the Duster works well on dust and not dirt and I am pleased to say that it does a fairly good job of removing dust and related particles from the surface of your vehicle.As mentioned, after thoroughly washing your vehicle, the Duster can help maintain that showroom finish that we all desire. I have owned about three of these dusters over the course of the last two decades and they are well-made. I just recently purchased my third duster after having used my last for about the last decade. The light coat of wax appears to last for years to come as long as you keep the Duster in its included case after use and do not expose it to elements such as sun and water."
1,Rubbish,Had one before with black handle. Awesome. Bought 4 more. S***ers! Will not stop dropping red fluff. Heap of crap.
3,"Leaves red lints. Other than that, it's OK.","I live in Florida and we get a lot of pollen during winter time. So I got this to dust off pollen and fine dust off my car. While it does a OK job removing the dusts and pollen, it leaves some red lints on the surface. Not a lot, but enough to notice especially on the windows. I shook it really hard and hit the garage wall to get rid of all the lints, but so far I still get them. I had this for about 3 weeks, and used it half dozen times. So I am not very pleased with this product. Just ho-hum about it."
3,Like a swifter for you car.,"It's just that simple. Just as the title states, if you want a quick dusting, just swipe away. A must have for those of us with black cars. This is not meant as a replacement to washing, it's meant to lessen the number of washings required. I still wash my car weekly, but I use this to keep it looking like I just washed it, all week long. I live in a dusty area, and it helps me keep my car's appearance attractive. Not to be used to clean the car, just dust it. Do not use over bird droppings and road tar. Not sure on the effect on your paint, so if you have a lot of dirt/dust, I suggest washing over dusting."
2,Tuiavii or Scheurman's way?,"I read this book long ago, as a teenager. Back then it already seemed to me that what I was reading were not the words of a Samoan chief, but of Scheurman himslef using the chief as a mouthpiece for his criticism of civilization. If you examine it closely, you will even be reminded of Gulliver's Travels by satirist Jonathan Swift. Reading it again now, my impression is still the same. As is the case with another famous ""Noble Savage"" discourse (Chief Seattle's), ""Tuiavii's Way"" is almost certainly the work of a Western critic of civilization rather than a non-Western perspective."
5,One of my Favorite Books Hands Down,"If you have not read this book you are missing out!!!! And for all of those who have given this book a bad rating I must not have read the same book I was reading because this book was jam packed with jaw droppers, surprises, twists and turns throughout the whole book! Every time I read this book I read it like it is first time I have read it. I can not get enough of it!!!!!! I do not want to give away the book but it sheds a deep light on Momma's Baby, Daddy's Maybe!!"
3,Good Book,"This book was a page turner, when I started reading it I couldn't put it down because I wanted to see what was going to happen next. The characters were unlikable and annoying, but aside from that it was a decent book."
2,Boring,"This book was poorly written. It could have used a good editor.I guess the story would have been good if I could have got pass the errors but it dragged and the characters lack deepth.Also, it took too long to get to point (was there a point?)Oh, well good attempt, but it will be returned."
4,you will never guess !!,"how this book ends up... My hats off to Jamise Dames, this book was excellent, very BIG surprise twist at the end, im pretty good at guessing how a book/movie will turn out, but the author got me on this one !"
5,AWESOME!!!!!,A must read!!! I am not even finished the book yet. Just started chapter 21 - for a first book this is AWESOME!!! I was surprised by some things that happened and didn't see it coming until a few paragraphs before it actually exploded. Somethings I did catch but was like no - that can't be. Can't wait to get to the end - I haven't been able to put it down. I usually just read on the bus but this has me reading at night too.
2,did i read the book wrong or something?,"i slept through most of this very slow novel, because that's how boring it was, i had to force myself to finish it and i just wanted to strangle most all of the chracters, and the author for writing such babbling crap, but on a good note, simone's situation was the best storyline."
4,Like No Other,"Momma's Baby, Daddy's Maybe is the start of Baby Momma's Drama like no other you will ever read.This was a fast pace moving story with character's you'd enjoy reading about.It was a story of love , lust ,secrets, betrayal, and heartaches because of mistrust and fascades.Secrets you would not believed that was revealed in the end. Three wommen, Three men, and the truth.This is spicy and sexy moving story you have got to read.Simone, Kennedy, and Miranda.Each have a story to share about there men.In all honesty I give the author 4.5* , and I can handly wait for her next novel.Great job and I will be looking forward to seeing one of the major book publishers picking this one up real soon.I feel Dafina (Kensington )would certainly love this one."
5,One of my favorite books!,"I read this book straight through when Hurricane Isabelle ripped through my city. Here I was stuck in the house with no power, water, or gas. It was hot, the food in my fridge was spoiling fast and I had been informed that the power would not be on for another month.Luckily I keep candles just for instances like these. I lit up enough candles for me to read comfortably and dug into the book. I went through page after page and my only regret was that I finished it the same day! I simply loved this book. Jamise takes you on a journey of up's and down's. She will have you laughing, crying and wishing that the book could keep going on.Nikkea ""Auset"" Lewis"
1,The Author is Writing The 5 Star Reviews,"Don't believe the reviews. The author is the one who is writing the good ones. This was an okay book. Nothing spectacular about it at all except the title. Not as bad as some out there, but not nearly as good as these five star author-written reviews. 1-5 it's no more than a two."
3,just okay for me,TOO MUCH CRAP. IT JUMPED FROM THIS CRAP TO THAT CRAP.. I WAS COOL ENOUGH FOR ME TO FINISH BUT I TOOK A LONG TIME FOR TO FINISH.....
2,BORING,"This book is boring, the plot did not get good until about 150 pages into the book and I was not surprised at the end either."
3,Boring...,"When I ordered this book I thought it was going to be full of drama based on the reviews, but it turned out to be too slow and long drawn out. I would not recommend this book for readers with a short attention span.Didn't like it all.....I put it down after page 110."
3,Could have Been Better!,"I just finished with this book and wasn't thrilled at all with it, I found it very predictable. I found it hard to finish this book which isn't good, because I'm an avid book reader. I knew what was up with Derrick, Michael, Nigel & Kaisha from the begining. The only thing that wasn't expected was the tragic death of one of the characters. I was so glad to finish the book that I didn't even read the preview of the author's next book which is at the back of the book. I know the next time I will go to go the library to read Ms. Dames' books. As for this copy it's going back to the store in exchange for something else."
1,Insult to intellectuals,"I read this book and I couldn't believe how negative it was - I only finished it because I always read a book to the end. I know this book is fiction, but come on - do black women and men need to be portrayed as stupid for the sake of making money? Some things, like the death of a child was unnecessary. I would not recommend this book unless the person was looking for a cheap read without any substance."
2,Guilty Pleasure,"This book is absolutely terrible. It's predictable in every way imaginable yet...I love it anyway. It is HILARIOUSLY bad, like a soap opera but in novel form. You'll guess the outcomes and what happens to each of the siblings long before the book actually ends but it's a guilty pleasure and while, NOT worth buying, a lot of fun regardless."
2,Disappointing,This book of accumulated stories started off great but died down with each story. I am sure it could have been better.
3,Slow to start but quick to finish,I have mixed feelings about this book. First let me say this much the book is very slow to get the ball moving I didn't get really into the book until the last 40 or 50 pages. Second the title is deceitful its more a black romance then a ghetto drama. Third it was predicatable and unpredicatble. It was painfully obvious that Kaisha wasn't Nigels daughter. But the part about Micheal and Jared was a real shocker. Its a decent book but it moves at a slow pace and sometimes you don't think you'll ever get to the end. Also some things seemed a little over dramatized like the death of you know who.
3,So predictable,"As far as novels go, and I've read a great deal of novels, this one was pretty average. Somewhat predictable and sort of depressing, with few interesting characters, one tragedy, just average. If you've already purchased this book, and have nothing else to read, then I recommend you read it, but I don't recommend you go out and purchase it. Let me re-iterate the fact that this novel is depressing and predictable, but not all bad. Happy Reading!!-Pryncez"
4,"Very sturdy, but hard to open","A agree with the 1 star review posted in 2008 that this dispenser is difficult to open. I also do not like that the attachment device is a zip tie, which makes it harder to change leashes without modifications by purchaser.But of all the bag dispensers I've owned, this one has stood the test of time. After over a year it is showing no signs of wear or of breaking down.So, if you have strong hands and only ever use one leash.... this is a 5 star choice. But for me there is still room for improvement."
4,Bags On Board Review,"We have always used ""Bags on Board"" for our pet clean up. Unfortunately, this time, the container that hangs on the leash broke off and we had to purchase a new one. I can't say how it happened because my husband was walking the dog. However, I would not let that keep me from purchasing this product. It is lightweight, easily dispensed and, having them on the leash, makes it so simple to clean up after your dog. Everyone should be required to carry something as a courtesy to walkers. You can use other types of plastic bags from groceries or other purchases, but these are the most compact and easiest to carry around and use."
5,aloe vera,Absolutely love this product! Provides moisture to your skin instantaneously without leaving a mess! Great for the aftersun and fun time!
3,"For fish tanks, not needed for swimming pools","The amazon.com software erroneously associated this product with Phosphate-removal treatments for swimming pools. In fact, the Phosphate treatment Natural Chemistry Phos-Free comes with a Phosphate level test kit. So you wouldn't need to buy an additional kit at all. There's nothing wrong with this product, BUT the link to swimming pools is an artifact of computer logic -- it demonstrates computers make loose associations just like human beings. I think the tag ""phosfree"" should be removed from this product."
1,Phosphate Test Kit - NOT FOR POOLS,Ordered this kit to test pool water for phosphates. The test result was suspect. I called the manufacturer and was told the kit was for Aquariums and that the chemicals in the pool water would produce incorrect results.
5,Anthropology at its best.,An amazing journey into the evolution of man and wisdom. I highly recommend this book.
5,Simply the best,"Believe it, these are the best bits out there. I have used several other brands and nothing comes close to Frued. You will not be dissapointed."
2,Pretty Doll but the book and the doll are not a high quality,I purchased this doll for my 6 year old daughter because I thought it might be nice to have a beautiful doll to act out a classic story -- but there were two problems. 1) the book is very thin and flimsy (not high quality) 2) The doll is pretty and has nice clothing but the head of the doll is so loose that it spins all the way around like something out of a horror film. This head problem was very disturbing for my daughter and she discarded it -- we gave the doll/book away shortly after opening it. Too bad -- it was a nice idea gone wrong.
5,This Guy is the best,"THIS DISK OF KEVIN MARTIN IS THE ALIVE IMAGE OF WHO WAS THE LEADER IN CANDLEBOX AS MUCH THE MUSIC AS THE LETTERS THEY ARE EXCELLENT IT IS A DISK THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION IF YOU ARE FANATIC OF THE ALTERNATIVE THING, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED"
5,Worth the wait.,"Being a Candlebox fan from the beginning, I was very disappointed when I had heard that the group parted ways. I knew that music was too much a part of Kevin Martin and that it was only a matter of time before we would hear from him again. Kevin Martin and the Hiwatts release of ""The Possibility of Being"" was definitely worth the wait!!! Kevin still relays the power and emotion behind his vocals, but the music as a whole, seems even stronger and tighter than before. KMHWs display strength in talents that go unmatched by any other, and go straight to the core of what is right in rock music today."
5,Kevin Martin Rocks!,I had seen and heard a little bit of this on youtube and from their website.I was blown away by the quality of this rockin cd.If you are a fan of Candlebox this is a must have.Kevin Martin's vocals are as good as ever and the music is well written and rocks.I highly recommend if you like good a@$ kickin Rock N Roll...
5,Full Watts!,"I'll keep this quick: This album is top notch rock and roll! The entire album is outstanding but is worth purchasing on the merits of the song, ""Identify"" alone! Make sure you don't miss out on this one!"
4,An excellent facsimile,"This book is a facsimile reprint of an 1871 book by W. W. Greener, a noted arms manufacturer and authority on firearms. The quality of the facsimile is high, except that one large table, which should have been reproduced as a fold-out, was reduced almost to non-readability. The original book meanders horribly in typical 19th-century style, but is very valuable for its detailed portrayal of the state of firearms technology in Britain circa 1870."
2,Miniature Poetry,"This book was frankly a disappointment. With Wangerin's beautiful prose, I expected beautiful poetry. What I got was often doggerel with cliched rhymes and nothing new to say. It is reminiscent of Madeleine L'Engles' poetry, both in rhyme and free verse, but shows considerably less skill (and L'Engle herself was no poetic genius). For all that, there are a few interesting ideas, an occassionally brilliant line; and (surprisingly considered his other verse) he was something of a master of the sonnet. The poems in this book are only occassionally the religious or mythopoeic on might expect from Wangerin, and certainly not strong enough to be a reason for purchase. If you are interested in the sonnet as an artform, get this book; if not, let it go."
1,NOT ACCURATE,"Similar to BB'S, and the lead ball will not hit the target accurately. They are almost impossible to zero in, so I do not suggest purchasing these."
1,Kitchen Aid Proline Toaster,"A huge disappointment. The toaster was used for two days before one half of the machine stopped working. For a $140 toaster this is ridiculous.This is an expensive machine bought so that the irritation of having to constantly replace cheap toasters could be ended. Instead it did not even last as long as a Walmart $12 model. Kitchen Aid - I thought - was a top quality outfit. So much for that illusion.KitchenAid KMTT400SS 4-Slice Metal Toaster, Brushed Stainless Steel"
5,Kitchen Aid...,This is simply the best of the best. It is built like a tank! I have had this same model for two years now at another home. You will never be dissapointed in a Kitchen Aid product. They are built to last.
4,Great taste,"Tastes like oatmeal, only chunkier. I like mine breads and cereals crunchier, so this was right up my alley. Takes about 25 minutes to cook, but overall, I like it."
5,just as GREAT as the other leading brand,look i love healthy life foods and you cant get healthier then steel cut oats...a 1/4 cup dry serving gives you 5 grams of Dietary Fiber the insoluble kind that catches all the nasties while it leaves your body whole...this brand grain size is just as big as the leading brand that starts with the M... you cant beat the price...and shipping i ordered the whole case
5,a lazy way to healthy eating.....,"I'm not much for cooked oatmeal so I take a 1/4 cup of these oats with some of the Honeyville blueberries and a good dollop of low-fat yogurt. Into the fridge with this concoction, and the next morning the liquid from the yogurt softens the oatmeal a little (but not too much). Healthy breakfast - about 2 minutes of work."
5,Delicious,"I've read about the health benefits and I suppose it's true that steel cut is better than rolled. But there's no doubt about the flavor and texture. Try this with them Sunday morning - cook 'em quick during the week but dress 'em up on sunday. First - 1-1/2 cup water to 1/2 cup oats yields a little crunchier cereal and a little more flavor in half the time. While they are cooking, separate an egg. Beat the white stiff. when you turn the cooked oats off, beat the yolk into the oats with a teaspoon of brown sugar or honey. then FOLD (don't stir) the beaten white in. Pile it all in a soup bowl and top with some raspberry jam and, maybe, a little cream. Add whatever else you like - pecans, walnuts, raisins. You can't not like this stuff. And you can make it a different kind of delicious each time"
2,helpful on a very basic level,"I found this book somewhat helpful. The skeletal structure and muscle structure was covered well in this book and easy for anyone to comprehend. I also got a lot out the authors definition and description of fascia. I thought that the auther was a little ""preachy"" about how horses shouldn't be ridden but not enough was covered on how they SHOULD be ridden. I would have preffered more coverage on what the benefits (cause and effect) of figures and specific exercises ridden correctly would create in the horse's body. Not exaclty what I was looking for but not time waisted in reading it either. It was an easy quick read. I did highlight two quotes that I loved. Read below:""The aids should be a passport to biomechanical efficiency.""""Yet, like a gradual crescendo and decrescendo, the work should begin and end with loosening: otherwise the notes might be in place but they won't make any music."""
1,"NOT A BAD OLD WW2 FILM,BUT AUDIO TRACKS ARE TERRIBLE AND VERY HARD TO HEAR ALL ACTORS","AUDIO TRACKS ON THIS DVD ARE ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE,YOU CAN HEAR SOME OF THE ACTORS AND OTHERS YOU CAN'T........JUST TERRIBLE! I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS,BUT I HOPE WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE WILL DO A BETTER JOB IN THE FUTURE!!!"
2,Trite war movie,"I've been watching war movies for 62 years. This one is a clear two-star and no more. Poor acting, weak plot, and trite war scenes. Robert wagner is pure corn and Broderick Crawford is a comic character. This one is going to be in my ""give it to the local library"" box. I can never see myself watching this again. Saving Private Ryan is a 5-star movie. That's my reference point, among others."
4,Robert Wagner as I'll always remember him...,"I saw this movie as a youngster....I'm only 6o now... but it was still a really good action movie with great performances from all.My age nor society's age hasn't altered any part of the movie... It's nice to see Wagner in his prime, like I used to be, and not as he is now...trying to sell my home out from under me.The social issues the movie attacks are easy to swallow compared to what we have to look at today. Amazing....poor share-croppers used to be a social issue....I was and am happy to see the then great actors and the will be greats. It had it all; action, romance, fighting, action, suffering, did I say action?"
2,"Turgid drama, Inept acting, Wrenched plot!","There is not much to recommend this trivial world war II drama. Broderick Crawford, Buddy Ebsen, and Robert Wagner all confirm their tertiary status in the Hollywood pantheon. The plot is inept and incredible, staggering through bunches of flashbacks. The minor miracle (Rich and arrogant southern playboy/landowner comes of age and learns to love the common man) is insufficiently believable. The battle action is sporadic.HOWEVER, the DVD presentation is fine. Super-saturated colors come through perfectly, and the definition is great! The DVD quality is the sole reason I give the film 2 stars rather than 1.May I recommend films such as Patton, Tora Tora Tora, or the Longest Day for fine World War II action!"
5,"Fairy tales, rated PG 13","Standing in a children's book store, I read my first Grimm's fairy tale and I was hooked. I was attracted by how odd the stories were to my modern eyes - I never knew that the wicked sisters' feet were cut up, and their eyes pecked out in the real Cinderella! Obviously the tales can be violent and gory, some of them have also been marked anti-semetic. This may not be a book for small children, but it is over 800 pages of wonderful storytelling. These are fairy tales that will live on forever in your heart."
1,Very Poor Quality,"While I'm sure the stories are great, I can't get past the poor type setting, and cheap paper which is practically newsprint. The words and illustrations bleed through from the next page making reading very difficult. And to make matters worse, the stories are set in a terrible, hard to read font and tight leading. This book is NOT kid-friendly at all. YUCK! Same is true of the Hans Christian Andersen Fairy Tales by same Author/Publisher."
4,Good for what it is,"My experience was this book was bad, but that was my fault for not reading the other reviews before buying it. If you know what you're buying, it's a good book (which is why I'm giving it four stars).I bought this to read with my children. Don't do that unless your kids are teenagers at least. The original stories aren't meant for small children. At a minimum the kids get bored; at the worst, they'll be terrified.I didn't care for the quality of the book myself; it looks like it was layed out by somebody that normally designs dictionaries or phone books. But you might like dense copy and inconsistent illustrations."
4,nostalgic stories from our childhood,"I love this book, and am very happy with it. It came fast, was in good condition, and had 210 fairy tales that i read in the first few days, and am rereading now.The only reason it got 4 outta 5 stars is because, which really, is my fault, i bought this thinking it was the ""real"" fairy tales. Which, it Kinda is, kinda isn't. It's not so much watered down as it is moistened, if that makes sense.After reading it, i realized that Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm's names are not on the cover anywhere. That is because, it is told the way that the ""new author"" wanted. Which is fine, i still love it. But I will now be getting a copy that i originally looked for.If you want fairy tales that you will like, and some that are fine to read to your children, this is a fine mix of both. The stories are still intact, so you don't lose any of the magic. It is worth buying and keeping in your home. Who doesn't like fairy tales? nobody, and this is a great starter book to them."
3,Cheaper price elsewhere.,I bought this exact book at Barnes and Noble about 7 months ago for only $19.95. Just a bit of a head's up to shoppers out there.
4,A Flash From My Childhood,"I thought this book was great! Not only is it full of wonderful stories, but also it let me finaly put a name to a story I knew from childhood: ""The Princess in Disguise"". This is a requirement in all book-lovers' collections."
1,Awful!,"I bought the kindle version, so at least I didnt pay much more than a buck for it. THe translation is so poor, often it's hard to understand. I bought it to read to my kids before bedtime, and most of the time I have to make it up as I go along.... Ugh, just annoying and awful!"
3,poor packaging,The packaging of this item was so poor that it had a very large tear in it on arrival and the front cover of the book was damaged. The rest of the book was in fine condition.
2,Low Quality,This looks like a publishers attempt to make money on a royalty free book. The book is loaded with typos. There are so many mistakes that any editor worth his salt should find on a first read.
5,Buy the Pantheon edition,"Amazon seems to have muddled up reviews of more than one edition of Grimm.The Pantheon edition, illustrated by Scharl, praised by Auden and others, has been my Grimm for 35 years and I love it still. I know of no reason to distrust the translation."
5,Looking for the real deal? This is for you,"If you are looking for the original Grimm's Fairy Tales in one volume, this is for you.Reading fairy tales in their original form takes one back to a much earlier time, back before they were written, when lives of children were in constant danger of being eaten by the many hungry adults who roamed Europe of the middle ages.I am a collector of Fairy Tales and folk myths. Many themes recur in folk myths around the world, a symbol of our collective unconscious.You will find familiar favorites here, but you will find them in a form you may find surprising - a bit gritty.Violence and death was the world of the middle ages.Terrific for those who want the real deal or for those who study fairy tales and folk myths."
5,The Complete Brothers Grimm Fairy Tales,This book has all the good storys that I can remember when I was growing up. Love reading these stories
3,good but bland..,"i like the variety, but it just seems all too boring.. though if i were desperate i would find it amazing"
3,Book,The cover was not what i had expected. The book took forever to arrive it almost didn't make it on time. The book at the very least was in perfect condition but other than that i am not exactly ecstatic about the whole ordeal.
1,very bad tranlation,I am not able to read those wonderful stories to my grand child because of the very poor translation of words and meaning!
5,Awesome,"I love these stories, I read them to my son! He's too young to really understand them, but it's an excellent collection for a fair price and I'm sure we'll cherish it for a long time!"
5,Wonderful Reading for any Age!,"The Brothers' Grimm wrote beautiful fairy tales, and they can be enjoyed by all ages. I think I enjoyed them most when I read them to my own children, but I have read them again since, and enjoyed them again. I read this collective edition in order to get all of them at one go, so to speak. The Brothers' Grimm were not writers by profession. They were scientific philologists, but decided to make up a collection of folktales. They spent thirteen years gathering the tales from various sources, and then put them down in writing in order to preserve them. Everyone knows these tales, but to name a few - The Frog Prince, Rumplestiltskin, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. These tales have endured and been loved for many years, and Disney has made some very memorable animated movies out of quite a few of them. Read them for your enjoyment, and to recapture a little of your lost youth."
4,Very good,The product looked real good despite the lack of packing in the bag type packaging. It was nice to receive the dust cover with the book. But for the price that I paid for the book all is excellent.
3,Grimm brother's fairy tales a little less grim,"These are the classic fairy tales that we heard as children, but they are not the original grim fairy tales written by the Grimm brothers. If you are looking to have a copy of the grim Grimm brothers then keep looking."
1,save your money: poor translations/newsprint-like book,"You don't need to trust me--you can look inside the book and get a load of the first translation of the ""Frog King"" which is unreadable. Someone just took an old translation and reprinted it on poor quality paper. This does not do justice to the tales."
1,"bad, bad, bad","Who published these weak translations? Yup, they are on newsprint and get smudged immediately. How about using real paper? B&N needs to stop thinking opportunistically and start thinking about quality."
1,Disappointing,"I wish I'd read these reviews before I purchased this book. As previous people have said, the formatting is atrocious as many words (nearly every line) are split over multiple lines. It is just about impossible to read and very frustrating. Don't buy this book!"
3,The good and the bad,The good: the active contents works. The bad: words are broken up - not even with hyphens. This makes reading difficult.
4,Nice,"The book is nice, but I would have preferred to buy one with more illustrations. This is more for an older child who can appreciate it for the story itself."
5,Not what I've been told!,"I love this book. It told me another side of the stories I've been told sicne I was young. It might destroy someone's fairy tales or sweet memories. But, it's not bad to read both side, and come up with your own decision (which side you would believe!)."
4,Great translation - not so great book quality,"While this is certainly not a ""coffee table"" quality book, the translation is true to form.I teach gifted children (3rd through 5th) and they love to read and hear the ""old words"". I use this book in a unit I teach on Fairy Tales. We read a story and then watch the pretty Disney version. We then compare and contrast the differences and similarities.They are often shocked and sometimes thrilled - especially the boys who thought fairy tales were for girls - at the darker aspects of the original versions."
5,The Complete Grimm's Fairy Tales,This is a great book to read. It is long but after you start reading it you will love it. I do
3,Ok but not great,"I liked this book, but it doesn't have nearly as many illustrations as I thought it would (the book was advertised as being ""fully illustrated."")Secondly, there are some fairy tales that I was sure this book would have but it doesn't. However this book does have lots of fairy tales.So I do recommend this book."
1,A non-show,"While this looks like it might be a good product, I ordered it on the first of August and have waited for its delivery, only to be told several times that there is a shortage in inventory. Seems that these are really not available. Do not waste precious time ordering this product."
4,kids love this movie,The tape was a little scratched up but it still worked and my nephews love it so i am happy with it :)
3,Here come the teletubbies,Video is old and has slight damage (like interference) but my Granddaughter loves it and has watched it everyday since I got it.So A good buy for the price. No complaints
2,Video Quality,Video has jerky sections between clear sections.Overall the story line is OK.Perhaps I should only purchase new DV
4,Still great,"My nine year old daughter ejoyed Teletubbies as a small child, she showed them to my 2 year old son on Youtube. He was immediately enthralled. This was an easy solution to his interest."
1,This show is just...WIERD!!!!!,"I know this show is for preschoolars, but I'm not joking when I say this, this show is teaching kids the aspects of gaiety.Tinkie Winkie: The lead Teletubby, the teletubby who's purple, the Teletubby who's favorite item is a purse, the Teletubby who has a triangle on his head, the Teletubby that has the accent of a she-man.I'm going to watch this again sometime and pay close attention to see if those crazy demons are trying to warp society.Overall rating: -----1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars +1"
1,They Should All Be Set On Fire And Put On Top of Pikes Peak,"Honestly, what do you expect when some of the main characters are named La-La and Po? All this does is warp your poor child's mind and gets them into bad TV. Heck, make your 2-year-olds watch South Park before you let them watch this! Honestly! This is worse than Barney. *shaking in background*LOCAL CRAZY MONKEY"
3,hypnotizes the little ones,"We got this video as a gift. Our twin boys have been watching the show since they were 3 months old in their bouncy chairs. The video provided the opportunity to have the powerful hypnotic effect of the vivid technicolor landscape and the primary hued tubbies at our disposal 24 hours a day. The video provides a loose plot sewn together with incoherent tubby blathering. The format follows the content of the pbs show 100%. If you need to know what you are buying, just tune in. I appreciate the spellbinding effects this noisy kaleidescope has on my children because it occupies them so fully for an hour. This is when my wife and I can have dinner. I do not appreciate the thinly veiled attempt at billing this as ""educational"" when, really, it is a cartoon in content."
1,WHAT THE HECK IS THIS CRAP,THIS SHOW WILL CAUSE YOUR DOG TO HIDE BEHIND THE COUCH AND WHINE LOUDLY IN TERROR AND YOUR KIDS WILL GO ON A RAMPAGE AND DESTROY NEW YORK CITY DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS WATCH THIS IT TURNS BRAINS INTO JELLO THOSE ALIENS ARE HERE TO DESTROY HUMAN BRAINS SO THEY CAN INVADE
4,Very popular with our 22 month old - who knows why!,"It is beyond our comprehension - but our 22 month old daughter loves the teletubbies! She is currently sick with a terrible cold, and she keeps saying ""More teletubbies!"" So the tape goes around and around. We think they're pretty wierd, and like Tinky Winky the least (voice is too deep to be cute); and I'm not wild about the baby talk... but they are, nevertheless a hit in our house!"
5,Kids love it!,"My 18-mo-old and 3-yr-old love this video. I have various Teletubbies tapes, and this one even hold MY attention. There is a segment where children are playing in the rain and splashing in puddles, and it's very cute. There is also a little animal parade with catchy music that my kids like. After saying the names of the animals over and over, my son now says them and recognizes which animals are which. So it's educational, too!"
3,"Good video, but a little annoying","My sisters loved the Teletubbies at young age and so did I, but this video was a little annoying. It would drive me crazy after I got to be five or six. We gave it to our little cousin Harrison when he was one because he loved the Teletubbies. Thank goodness I got rid of it because it was annoying!"
2,A food start.,"I perchased this video when the tellatubies first were introduced in our country from europe, my niece loved it and at the time she was very young it was the only way to hush a screaming baby, now she can sing and dance with them, she loves the tellutubies, they are fun and educational."
5,I LOOOOVE the teletubbies!!!,I love the teletubbies with a couple of beers (and then some...). It is absolutely hilarious! Who says you have to be 4 to enjoy this medium?
3,MUSICAL AND WERID?,"WELL I DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE SAYING AND THEY DONT HAVE A MEANING, WELL THEY DO DANCE AND MAKE SOUNDS BUT NOT GOOD ONES. I DON'T KNOW IF TINKIE WINKIE IS A MALE OR FEMALE BUT, HE SOUNDS LIKE A MALE ,AND IF HE IS WHY DOES HE HAVE A BAG (SO THEY CALL IT) IN THE FRIST PLACE? ANYWAY HIS VOICE IS TO DEEP IT DOESNT SOUND CUTE TO TALK TO A CHILD, LALA IS FINE AND PO IS CUTE BUT IS DIPYES BLACK OR WHAT? IF NOT WHY IS HE DARKER THAN EVERYONE ELES? SO WHAT ARE THEY TRYING TO DO HERE MAKE UP SOME OF ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE? ALL COLORS, WELL IT NEEDS SOME WORK BUT WHATS DONE IS DONE..."
1,WHAT IN HELL ARE THEY?,THE TELETUBIES ARE GOOD FOR LITTLE KIDS BUT I THINK IT IS POINTLESS.THEY SPEND A HALF HOUR LOOKING AT A CHAIR OR PROJECTING KIDS VIDEOS IN THERE STOMACHES.
2,just a tad boring,"song intros are drawn out and redundant. Vocal melodies are forgetable. Maybe i should have got a nickelback cd, or better yet, gone to sleep."
4,"pride,shame, guilt: emotions of self assesment","Taylor engages with what little contemporary philosophical literature there is on the subject. That engagement is both insightful and well written providing us with conceptual tools that may lead to a better understanding of these moral emotions as 1) having a significant place in our lives, 2) that these moral emotions deserve more attention within moral thinking and theory, 3) that such tasks would entail that our moral lives would deepen in ways that reflect Aristotle's thought that it is easy to be angry, but it is hard to be so in the right way, to the right , person, at the right time. An excellent study of the moral emotions"
1,What is your definition of wood?,"Sorry charlie, wood this is NOT. The description of this item CLEARLY states ""Made of Wood in Laminate Black Finish "" Yes, there is a laminate black finish, NO it is NOT wood. Although rather sturdy, this is PARTICLE BOARD AKA pressed wood chips. I ordered this because it was billed as wood.Be warned, if you are looking for wood, this is not your item."
1,proof that self-publishing does the world no good whatsoever,"What kind of a person would write a memoir in the third person? This woman must be a little insane, and that's too bad, but it won't stop me from saying this: ""Violation"" is a terrible book."
4,exciting book to read,My wife said I had to read this book she got. It had alot of mis-spelled words and sometimes confusing. All I did was email the author and she answered all my questions and then I understood it. As I spoke to her I can see why it was written like that. She published the book herself. Under all the stress and medication she was on I think she really did a good job. I would recommend anyone to read this book and to tell there friends to read it.
5,a classic,"This album is one of the finest jazz albums I've heard in a long time. Check out the first track which was written by Jimi Hendrix. Without a doubt, Idris brings it on this album. A great drummer on a great album."
2,The fun ends to quickly!,"i am 10 and i got ths game yesterday afternoon. I already beat the whole game. The levels are a lot of fun but short and easy. The graphics are wonderful. The game also has interactive reef, where you can make your own reef. That game is pretty boring but still cool. There are a bunch of small games that are fun but i think im too old for it. I think you shouldn't get this game if you're my age or older."
1,Don't waste your money,This game is dumb. There is no major obstacle ... just small mini-games that are so sadly easy. I recommend Super Mario Brothers!! Skip this one.
2,Today it looks like a parody.,It's amazing how quickly the images and meaning of men can be transformed in the public consciousness. I couldn't get past the first chapter or so.
3,Cal Smith-Country Bumpkin CD,"I bought this because it said the song Amanda (my second daughter was named after this song) was track song #6. However the songAmanda is not even on this cd. It was a major dissapointment! However Cal Smith has such a beautiful voice, it is worth listening to. I wanted to play this song for my daughter and since it was not on this cd as stated, I could not."
3,"Alright, but didn't live up to expectations","After reading all the comments from the people on Amazon.com, I bought the video, expecting to buy a gem that I'd like to watch over and over again. I'm not sure what people found so funny, there were a couple vaguely amusing parts, but the video as a whole wasn't all that funny. What kept my interest was finding out who was going to win. Now that I know who won, I'm not sure I want to watch it again. I give it 3 stars, for being a video that was an interesting one to watch once. If it was one I'd watch over and over again, I would give it more, but I don't think that's going to happen. At $12 for the DVD, it's not a bad deal though."
2,Too Much Hype,"After reading about this DVD and that it was so funny i sat down to watch it. I thought that it went on and on. I mean the contestans are funny and all but I was completely bored. Not only was it boring, it was lame. It got old after 15 min. It went on and on and 93 minutes later I felt as if I had taken a nap. Don't get me wrong, I love watching funny stuff. I just think this was not funny. I wanted to inform everyone that it is not a 5-star DVD. Definetely a watch once then it will collect dust. Its your money spend it on a pillow instead."
2,"Try Hoop Dreams- Twice as Long, Three Times More Compelling","Come on. The hick with the winter climate and the summer teeth was amusing, otherwise I felt nothing for any of the contestants. Waiting For Guffman would be a referral that provokes more thought than anything this weak Junior-College- Film-Class project puts forth. I can't figure which was a bigger waste of time, the 70+ hours these losers spent away from their law practice (Isn't that where most of them worked?) or the hour and a half I could have spent watching Best in Show again."
1,Definitely not entertainment,"I had bought this documentary after reading the other reviewers comments about how good it is, but I could hardly drag myself through the whole hour and half of watching people standing and their philosophy on standing.I am not sure whether it is some kind of cultural divide between Texas and Chicago or it is something that I did not understand. I and my friends watched the movie together, and at the end of it we were depressed at having lost one and half hours and mystified as to how any body could laugh at it."
3,"Fun, but very cheaply produced documentry","Worth seeing if like getting insight into the very, Very, VERY common Joe's of the world. These people ar soooo real they would never be cast in a reality TV show! Yep .. that real!"
3,Interesting slice of life....,"...I was hedging over 3 or 4 stars, but some of the overblown positives pushed me toward the 3 rating here. Consider it a 3.5 perhaps. Anyway, I enjoyed this quite a bit. Sometimes plays like an Errol Morris film. It was more interesting than hilarious, but satisfying overall. Definitely a one-time film, as a previous reviewer pointed out, but a unique movie to lend to your friends. It reminded me a bit of Survivor!, but I found that the TV show perhaps stole this idea (endurance just standing) for some of the ""tribal"" challenges. Neither great nor bad, with a few twists here and there."
1,Very unhappy,CD was damaged and we could not see the end of the picture. We still don't know who won! Too bad.
2,Not Cheerios and Not Applejacks either,I bought these (plainer box) at a Whole Foods. Definitely not worth the $4.29 I paid for them. They're so... bland. Like someone lightly and I mean lightly sprinkled bits of cinnamon and dried apples over cardboard. There are no vitamins added either. So there's little health value. They could've at least put some vitamins in there to make eating flavored cardboard worth it. I'll probably just eat this box as a snack alternative to potato chips. I can't afford to just toss them. Will NOT be buying them again.
2,My kids don't like it,I bought this cereal for my kids (ages 6 and 7) who can't eat gluten any more. They won't eat it. I think it passes to at least finish the box but my kids would be happy to throw it out.
2,Yuck!,"OK, I can't stand these things, but my babies love them, so I gave it 2 stars, not one. First of all, it's just puffed corn, like Peanut Puffs, if you've had those by Envirokids. And that wouldn't be so bad if they didn't taste like you were licking a cinnamon stick or putting a teaspoon of ground spice in your mouth. For being ""all natural"" it sure does pack an unpleasant wallop! Watch out! Maybe the Honey Nut is better..."
4,Good O shaped cereal for kids,"My son loves these, thank goodness. They hold up well in soymilk for ceral in the morning and also hold up well in snack bags. He is constantly needing 'O' shaped cereal for projects at school, and these work great. They are a bit sweet, but he doesnt mind."
1,HORRIBLE,"This game is very bad when installing it on a laptop. I tried to install it but got error messages and damaged my system. Soon called customer Support , which is a phone number u have to pay for because i live in NY but its in CA, then they couldnt help me and made everything worse. My computer is one month old and has a very very high quality , but this game damaged my laptop and I advise you never buy games from this company."
5,I LOVE THE SIMPSONS !!!,"This game is not the best game I ever played, but it ROCKS!What is good about this game is that u know the whole city.For example, in the tv show the simpsons, when homer goes to moes u dont know how to get there.But in the game u can see wher it is located.Basiclly this game is great and I think u should get it.OH, and the game is realy funny, and graphics are good too.Im a big fan of the simpsons and I think I saw every episode of the simpsons, and if u dont bellive me just ask me a quastion about the simpsons, also if u have quastions about the simpsons just right me at superstas3000@hotmail.com.I hope this has been helpful.Well se ya :-)"
3,Great game for all Simpsons fans,"Hit and Run is a very fun game for its connection to the simpsons TV show. Some of the cool aspects are the voiceovers. They are done by the actual cast of the showfrom Bart all the way to Hans Moleman. This is a great game that acts like Grand Theft Auto but more cartoonish so children can play as well. Basically you go from Point A to Point B in many missions. You also pick up many coins and cards to progress with the story. coins help you buy the cars and clothing to advance the story along.Problems are that in the story, many of the missions become repetitive. You do the same things in every mission. Like follow a truck or get from point a to point b. POlus it gets really dificult after the 4th level. You find yourself not completing the mission and have to keep retrying. what they should have done was make difficulty levels for people. You will find yourself getting angry a lot.Hit and Run is a great game for fans of the show, but gameplay needs to be improved."
1,A shame...,"At first, I could install the game, but I could not play it. I got a message that an error occurred in Simpsons.exe, which seemed utterly ridiculous.Then, I upgraded to XP, and I couldn't even install the game! I kept getting an error that I had the ""wrong volume"" of the CD in the drive. The readme file said that it was because my drives' drivers were out-of-date (even though I could install the game previously). Thus, the game is basically a coaster because thus far, nothing I have done has worked.I *have* actually played the game, and it is loads of fun, but I think it is almost criminal that software companies can sell games that do not work."
1,Worst PC game ever!,"Do not, I repeat, do not purchse this game for the PC! You will have trouble installing it, and even if you succeed, the game will most likely lag horribly. After the second level, the game becomes extremely difficult and frustrating. The levels will provide missions with easy tasks but very very annoying obstacles-short time limits, uncontrollable car handling, pedestrians and other objects getting in the way, cops chasing & crashing into you, etc, etc. This game is the worst gaming experiences i have ever had. Wish I could choose zero stars!"
1,Yuck!,"I got this so called ""best simpsons game ever"" for christmas. It started out good, with nice un-frustrating missions. But then you get up the the ""frustrating point"". This game is EXTREMELY frustrating. Okay, Okay, I'm not a very patient person, but if you've played this then you'll know excactly what I mean. Although the extras like costumes from Simpsons Eps like Homer with A Donut Head and Lisa as Florida are pretty cool, this game is still annoying. ""The First Great Simpsons Game Ever"" oh please, more like ""The Third Worst Simpsons Game Ever"". This is not worth $70.PS: I LOVE The Simpsons TV Series."
1,THE WORST GAME INSTALLATION EVER!!!,"I GOT THE SAME ERROR MESSAGES AS OTHERS BELOW WHEN TRYING TO INSTALL THIS PIECE OF CR*P 5 TIMES, AND EVEN HAD TO RE-INSTALL MY DIRECTX FROM MICROSOFT'S WEBSITE TO RESTORE THE ONE THIS GAME CORRUPTED!!! I NEVER EVEN GOT A SINGLE GAME SCREEN & I PLAY GAMES ALL THE TIME!!!! SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE & BUY BIG MUTHA TRUCKERS, OR MONSTER TRUCK MADNESS 2!!!!"
1,Crashes on startup,"The commercials look great; the clips on their site also look fun. It's just too bad I cannot play this game.My machine meets the requirements, but the game crashes when I try to start it. Wait for a patch before spending any money on it (assuming, of course, that one will be released)."
1,I didn't know before I bought it,This game does not work with Vista! I have not been able to play it since I bought it! :( I wish someone had wrote about this before I bought it! And seeing that it was my fault I didn't try to return it. I have played the demo of this game and it was very fun!
2,Windows limited users can't save games,"My son bought this game and from what I can tell so far, he loves it. As a parent however, I've got a beef with this game. My son is set up with a ""limited user"" acccount on Windows XP so I don't have to worry about him dinkering with the control panel settings, changing other kids' passwords, etc. The problem I have with this game is this: he can't save a game unless his account is changed to an ""administrator"" account. This is confirmed by Vivendi's tech support. So now, either I give him full access to the computer, or he can't save. Doh!"
3,Runs on my laptop...,"It seems like a lot of people have been having trouble playing this game on their laptop pcs, and one said that customer support claims that no laptop can handle the game. However, I run the game just fine on a nowhere near top of the line Compaq Presario 2100 with a 1.6Ghz processor, 512MB ram, and an AT1 Radeon 320 graphics card."
2,Mission Impossible,"This game has all the elements of an excellent Simpsons game. Real voices, accurate reproductions of every aspect of Springfield, and last but not least, free-for-all demolition derby vehicular destruction! Nevertheless, it gets old after about 2 hours because the missions that are required in order to advance in the game are very, very difficult. They simply do not give you enough time to complete the missions, so you end up trying and retrying them 10-15 times. It ends up being a real bear of a game and I can't recommend it as a result. A pity too, it has such potential."
2,Did not work.,"I purchased this hoping to bypass video on my Pioneer AVH-P4200DVD. After going online AND speaking with customer service multiple times, we could not get this to perform the bypass. It was determined to be faulty and I returned the product. Additionally, I found a significantly cheaper and simpler solution. While it may have tons of uses, it could perform the default function."
1,pac tr7,product was junk. only worked for a few minutes and would have to be reprogrammed. ended up uninstalling and not using it at all.
5,Amazon Convenience,"Yeah, I could get this a Lowes, but I was shopping for other stuff and threw this into the mix. The product produces good smoke in my smoker, the chips are pretty well chopped up, though I did get one log. All in all, the product smokes, and I got great Amazon delivery when I needed it!"
5,Great Chips,"Item was described correctly on Amazon. I highly recommend this product a great asset to your smoker for shrimp, beef roast, pork loin, chicken thighs."
3,Good Chips- Good Price,"Good chips for the price. Could be a bit bigger, they only last about an hour on gas grill"
2,very small chips,"I thought I'd at least get a few nice sized chunks (i think it mentioned in the description), however these were very small chips. Just using as accent tastes along with hickory chunks."
1,We have not received he smoker.,"We have not received he smoker. The rest is still in ;t;he box/ I have not used the chocolate pump either. What do ;you mean ""time required"""
4,Applewood smoke chips,Good source of apple wood for smoking. We used before we had a source for Gravenstein apple wood logs & branches. Imparts delicious flavor for pork & fowl
5,Quality chips,These are great chips and smother without burning especially when soaked for an hour or two in warm water. These are much better quality and larger chunks than those cheap chips you get at Home De... or Walm....
5,Excellent smoke & flavor,Excellent smoke & flavor. Did soak chips overnight before using. Usually use hickory chips from my own trees. No mesquite trees native to Central Missouri.
3,it does the trick,I bought these chips because I could find none locally. Honestly I would pay less a Gander Mountain but they were out and I needed pecan for a salmon I was going to smoke. If you are a newby to smoking meats and fish pecan is a suttle wood that is great for fish and poltry but don't overspend for weber chips they are no different from any other brand.
3,Original Sacred Harp Music CD,"This is not a CD that I will listen to frequently. I had heard a couple of Sacred Harp songs while listening to the soundtrack from ""Walk to Cold Mountain"" and the type of music intrigued me. I was interested in hearing more. There are a couple of songs on this particular CD that I may listen to again, but I doubt that I will invest a lot of time or money in this particular genre. The CD itself was of good quality."
5,Great for my active lifestyle!!!! :),"I take Nattokinase along with the Serrapeptase( hope spelling is right).every morning and I've not felt this great in a long time nor did I ever have an active lifestyle.I feel refreshed everyday all day and in always a great mood; alot of suppplements I used take I'vestopped taking because of this amazing product.No longer feel like a slugg, I feel like a very healthy woman!!!"
5,It seems work to lower blood pressure...,"My wife, 63, has been taking Nattokinase -- two per day -- for the last six to eight weeks. It seems to decrease the systolic pressure by 10 to 20 points and the diastolic pr by about 5 to 8 points. We have tried to test that by her skipping it for a day or two and BP rises back to its old level. She is able to take this (or any such) supplement only when it is truly vegetarian and we are glad that the Dr Best's brand has it available."
2,Doubtful Results,"Nattokinase is destroyed by stomach acid, and I found out after receiving my order that the capsules are not enterically coated. Without the protection, I doubt that the beneficial effects are being realized."
4,Satisfied,"Seems like a good product but how would you prove it. Good insurance policy against future problems, works for the japanese"
3,Don't know,I can't tell if it is doing anything so I guess time will tell. Some things take awhile so maybe it is helping. I don't know.
2,DOES NOT WORK FOR EVERYONE,"I have taken 2,000 Fu a day for nearly a month for moderately high blood pressure and have seen no decrease."
2,Something's not right here,"I'm reading all these positive reviews and saying to myself, Something's not right here. I bought one of these and it DOES NOT work well. Sure, if you compare it to an ""incandescent bulb,"" which too many other reviewers suspisciously do, it is marginally better. But if you compare it to a full size black light fluorescent tube, this CF version is sorely lacking. This bulb, used with or without a shade, does not make white, like your teeth or on your clothes, glow brightly. It only marginally makes bright colors pop. The black light effects are not obvious; you have to really look for them. If you think you're going to use these at a party and everyone freaks out, forget it. I think the problem is the bulb is too bright. You would think it makes sense that a fluorescent light, even in CF form, would make black light work better, but it is a poor substitution for ""real"" black light fluorescent tubes."
3,Great while it lasted!,"My wife and I loved the effect of this bulb, while it lasted. It was much brighter than any other black light (intended for consumers) we'd seen in the past. Unfortunately, it burnt out within about a month of light use (a few minutes a day).It may have just been a faulty bulb, but considering the high price (for a single bulb, anyway), I'd expect better quality control."
1,Not at all the same,"I purchased this as I was making some glow drinks for the first time and didnt want to waste money on the full tube light. What a mistake, it can barely get a slight glow from Tonic water or a yellow highlighter... I don't see how people are reviewing these things positively like they are the greatest thing... If you want a black light effect, purchase a tube black light. Done"
3,Ehhh,"i though it would be brighter but its ok i guess, great for smaller rooms not Living rooms or partys."
2,Very dim bulb,"I purchased this light bulb to place outside during Halloween. The bulb is very dim; hardly enough to light up 1 foot around the exterior lamp. It gives off a neat purple glow but is not effective. I believe the term ""Black Light Blue"" is misleading when the bulb that I received performed nothing AT ALL like the photo posted by 'Ruben R'."
2,Failed prematurely,"I ran this bulb for several days in conjunction with some photography stuff I was doing. It initially produced UV light exactly as desired, but the bulb grew dimmer and dimmer, and after 5 days half of the twists wouldn't light at all. It seems the ballast or some other component started failing almost immediately. I haven't had issues with regular Feit CFL bulbs, but I suspect there's something not right with these as I've read plenty of similar complaints."
4,Feit Fluourescent blacklight bulb,"I would recommend, works better than conventional bulbs and is more energy efficient. Produces a nice blacklight that works well and makes white objects glow."

3,satisfied,"satisfied with the color, but it was not expected q should put more pictures to see the product well. But overall not bad lycra. regards"
1,Is not like in they said,"I got this pant, to wear it under muy running pant, and is big,It doesn look like in the pic"
2,Horrible echo....,"I recently purchased the vt-1920c from another online retailer. After receiving the phone, we hooked it up to replace our older v-tech 912 analog 900MHz (it has no caller id, which is why we go the 1920). Unfortunately, the older analog phone sounded better (less echo, more incoming voice volume). We sent back the 1920. The only reason I gave the 1920 2 stars is because of its good feature set."
2,A very mediocre phone...,"The phone is ok, nothing more. The reception from outside callers is fine, but when I talk, my own voice in the earpiece has significant static--it's pretty annoying!The phone is heavier then I thought it would be (Maybe all 900MHZ phone are, my old cordless was analog) and it's not very comfortable when holding it with your shoulder and no hands.I live in a relatively small apartment and was surprised that when I went to another room (maybe 50 feet away) the calls would cut out! And this is why a bought a 900 mhz digital phone!Finally, a complaint would be the apparent inability to program the numbers into memory alphanumerically. In other words, I have to scan through a list of phone numbers, instead of seeing, ""Mom and Dad"", ""Office"", etc.I probably would have sent it back, but unfortunately, I tossed the box, so I guess I'll live with it."
1,This phone was so bad I returned it. Horrible echo,"I sent this phone back. The handset is heavy and does not feel comfortable in your hand or against your head. The worst was the echo I heard of my own voice. Oh, by the way, the rebate offer expired in 1999. So don't count on that to make this phone worth your money. My advice- pass on it."
1,Poor Phone!,"This phone is going back this weekend. Very poor coverage within the house (static), the keys stick, and there is not enough volume. You get what you pay for!"
2,Disappointed,"This product does not have very good range and it does not fit very well to your ear. Don't count on holding it on your shoulder either. The features are ""OK"". The phone constantly searches for channels which interrupts conversations when you go outside your house/apartment."
5,I Love It!!!,"I love this cook book, I use it all of the time. I have one of my own and I just bought this one for my mother-in-law for Christmas. I also went to this high school so this is a big deal where I live. This cookbook is now out of print and are not sure if it will be printed again. When I found this on Amazon I had to have it!!! AWESOME PURCHASE!!!!"
3,This one earned a grade of C from me at All About Romance,"If the sole purpose of reading this book is to become turned on, then I suppose it serves its purpose. But for those readers looking for more varied entertainment, the pickings are fairly slim here. The lead characters are likable enough, but the secondaries are either over-the-top or stereotypical. The characters' backgrounds require a great deal of suspension of disbelief, and the small word count of the series romance only exacerbates these flaws."
4,Hustler White,"oh, get a life you nuts that expect a lot from our friend bruce. this is a great bruce labruce film. this is not as goodas Skin Flick or Strawberry Reich, but tony ward is good at his job in the film. and this one is also a lot of fun around the edges."
1,Soiled my virgin eyes,Pink Flamingos meets Santa Monica Blvd. Disgusting movie. Horrible acting. I threw it away. Save yourself the money.
1,"An offensive, racist film.","The film gratuitously examines different ""kinky"" gay sexual practices, including erotic asphixiation, mutilation, and bondage. At one point a white, blond boy's choice to engage in sex with a group of black males is equated with these other ""unusual"" practices. The filmaker's equation dehumanizes the blacks, as does the suggestion that black males in need of a condom must use a wrapper from a loaf of ""Wonder Bread."" The movie shows a sordid side of gay life that some may enjoy seeing depicted . However, in this thoroughly racist scene the film also encapsulates why many black individuals are alientated from white gay culture."
1,Cheap and vulgar and that's the best I can say.,"To steal the opening scene from ""Sunset Blvd"" was bad enough but to pander to all the negative stereotypes of gay life was just a bit much for me. I wouldn't recommend this film to John Walters."
2,Is this just a porn movie?,"There is a fine line between a movie that is purposely camp and just a bad movie. I am not certain in which category I would place this one. It is this kind of movie that continues to promote negative images of the homosexual community. I felt that the movie was violent, pourly written, badly cast, and horribly acted. There were several violent sex scenes that looked like they had come from a porn movie and just as badly acted. Definitely not a movie I would share with my parents or straight friends."
2,Low budget porn.,"The only reason why I watch this video is because Hunk model Tony Ward stars in it. Tony Ward is that dreamy hunk that came out in Madonna's controversial Justify My Love video. Since then I have not been able to get studly Tony Ward out of my mind. He is the only reason for watching this film. Other than that the film is not worth anything, unless you are really into all that street Hustling of Hollywood. I warn you that this film is not very good. Direction is bad, picture isn't that good, low budget, mediocre plot, and Extremely explicit sexual scenes are characteristics of this film. The only saving grace of the film is the hunkster Tony Ward. If you want Tony, then this is a good film to see all of him. Otherwise, discard the rest of the film. This film is really not suitable for people of any age."
4,The funniest low budget film since Faster Pussycat,"I'm merely a ""mutant hetero"" but I found that what the film lacks in technical skill, it more than makes up for in quotability. It needs to be seen multiple times in order to catch and memorize them all.Bruce La Bruce sure knows all about tragic Hollywood suicides. I'm tempted to order his books now. The sex scenes are certainly not as graphic as ""regular"" gay porno. What you imagine is much worse than what you actually see on screen. It's not as if there are any close-up penetration shots. Perhaps the razor blade scene with the ""Versace Model"" (don't want to give away the gag), made me cringe the most.Not to be taken too seriously, I recommend this film to anyone wants a truly ""burnt"" midnight movie laugh-fest. It's been the biggest hit among my friends since ""Faster Pussycat"" and ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls""!Rent it even if you're not gay!"
3,Good if you just want to be entertained,"Hustler White, is a strange tale of two people who are looking for the same thing and don't know how to go about getting it. If you are looking for high art then you don't want to see this movie, if you are looking for somehting with a message again this isn't the movie for you. But if you are into camp and weirdness for camp and weirdness sake then this is just the right film for you. It has a few laughs and you might enjoy the reffernces taken from better films. Again this isn't a movie for all tastes. This movie contains graphic sex and language, not for the faint of heart."
4,Deviant Fun,"Sure the movie is odd, but that doesn't mean it's bad. The scenes of gang bangs, amputee sex, mummification, among others are not for everyone, but this stuff DOES go on.Ignore the ""shocking"" moments and you have a fun film with a dark sense of humor. The acting is sub-par, but that's what goes with this genre (think John Waters, Greg Araki, Larry Clark). Taken as what it is, it's diverting, amusing, dark and memorable (for better or worse, the images DO stick with you)."
4,Campy Fantasies/Brilliant Film,"Anyone who cites this film as racist obviously misses the entire point of this film. If the black men in this film are treated as objects it is because everyone (white and black) are objects of sexual fantasy. This film is about the wild fantasies that most people never have the courage to act out. For these fantasies to work people have to be dehumanized. Hustlers are sex OBJECTS not dinner guest popping by for tea and sympathy. No one in this film is meant to be a real, fully-human being with possibly the exception of Monti Ward (Tony Ward) and Jurgen Anger (Bruce LaBruce). Even the last beach scene of the film continues the notion of living in one's fantasy: this time Jurgen's. The film is brilliant for its Hollywood satire and its unabashed portrayal of sexual fantasy. It's not Shakespeare, but it's definitely worth taking a look at."
2,XXX-tremely bad!!,"Very strange movie not unlike the documentary ""Sex/Life in L.A."" with 'actor' Tony Ward as the common link.Basically a film about a few days in the life of a street hustler (Ward) and some of his colleagues. Some of the scenes are quite strong especially the amputee bits!! (need I say more).The 'acting' is interesting especially Bruce La Bruce who plays the camp researcher Juergen Anger.Somewhere between a porn film and a film about porn.In summary, I wouldn't advise buying but watch it if you get chance. You won't know whether to laugh, cry or ....!!"
1,Downright digraceful,"I have seen a lot of films, but this is definitely the worst. The content of this film almost made me ashamed to be gay, as it showed a real ugly side to a sick and twisted world of the film-makers fantasies. You couldn't even class this garbage as good porn."
3,Good Monitor...,"I recently bought this monitor from Amazon at a great price. It is light and saves a ton of room. However, the monitor I received had an obvious defect - There is a noticable white dot on the screen that will not go away... The blemish is noticable to the naked eye and I should get a new monitor..."
2,A disappointment,"I had high hopes for this monitor after reading other reviews, but pulled it out of the box, plugged it in, and felt a pang of disappointment. Pixels are apparently missing in the screen, making small green dots appear on the desktop that can't be removed. I was also disappointed that the viewable screen was only 12"" wide and 9"" tall -- not even close to the full 15"" as stated in earlier reviews. I'll be returning the unit for a full refund. It's unfortunate, because the monitor itself looks great on my desk."
1,Save Your Money,This so-called documentary is a hodge-podge of frequently repeated film clips and excerpts from grade B Hollywood mono-color Roman-spectacle movies interspersed with inane comments by revisionist historians. Also included for your enlighgtenment is an attack on conservatives as wealthy oppressors and a measure of Christian bashing. Don't waste your money on this mess - I wasted mine!
3,Rome THe power & Glory,AS a hstorical medium it was a little on the short side. As an entertainment DVD it was great for me. To tell the truth I thought I was getting the mini series that came out a few years ago. MY fault for not checking it out better.
1,touring Paris,Obsolutely awful!!!I purchased it to view in my French class; what a waste!!! I am very disappointed!!
4,Fore & Aft,"I particularly enjoyed this product, wether from movies or documentaries we all now about the heights of Rome. What I most like about this series is both the nuts & bolts of Rome's early development & the true nature of its decline which was a decline, not a fall. What I would most want to see from developers/producers next is how (much) of Rome's advanced knowledge of engineering was lost? We recognise that civilisations come & go, but we expect that the wealth of human knowledge continues to grow. This is not necessarily the case however & it would be interesting to know the How & Why?"
4,Comprehensive Overview,"Obviously no documentary can cover each and every aspect of a civilization that lastest as long as Rome, but it has chosen areas to cover that will give you the sense of the times, the events and the people. Peter Coyote is a good narrator, adding his talent to the material being offered. There is a fine line up of professionals that add their opinions and comments to the topics being discussed that add a dimension to the program. The program covers the time of the Etruscans, before Rome was even a city, to the ultimate fall of this empire. The recreations are entertaining and informative. You will learn a lot about Rome."
3,good solid historical video,"The one I saw of the set is ""Grasp of Empire"" volume IVand it makes plain the virtues and drawbacks of the Roman civilization.The fall of Rome seems to have come when the tributeof conquests stopped flowing about 106 AD according to that video.The decay was much due to the over use of slaves and the growth of large estates beside the decline of the moral virtues of the past.Violence in the games is pointed out as being a dehumanization factor that desensitized the Romans to the pain of others."
5,Entertaining and Educational,I would recommend this collection to anyone with any interest in history. Everyone in my family enjoyed it. The costumes and scenery are great and the stories are interesting. It's very educational for those of us who don't have a degree in history.
4,Great introduction to Rome,"I thought it would be worse because of the relevance given to fighting and gladiators, but it has a lot of information and is quite entertaining. Great for students.It delivers more than it seems to promise by its cover. It's less than a seminar on Roman history, but more than simple entertainment for kids."
3,toons review,my favorite out of these toons is the penguins even though it's for cigarettes. I have Spring Song on another collection 600 giant cartoon collection
2,Could Have Been Better,"Being a fan of many Everest climbing adventure books, I was interested in this because it was about a woman, the first British woman to climb Everest (in 1993), but I was disappointed. Although well written and somewhat interesting, it didn't really hold my attention. There was not enough information about her regular life and then not enough personal stuff about being a woman among men for 2+ months on this grueling journey. I never got to really know the people with her. Plus I found the back and forth of the journey (to be expected) very confusing in this particular version of a climb up Everest. There are much better books out there, but sadly very few about women."
5,Great!!!,"""Beyond the Divde"" is a great book, intended for mature readers. Will Simon has been shunned by his Amish community and is planning to go to California. His daughter Meribah travels with him and this is her story on the trip on the emigrant trail during the Gold Rush. They join a company and Meribah becomes friends with a rich girl name Serena Billings. This book is packed with emotion, information, and action. I guarentee that a mature reader, who enjoys or dosen't mind historical fiction, will love this book."
1,Possibly the worst book ever!,I had to read this book for school and it is probably the worst book I have ever read. I stopped after 100 pages and never finished it. I just couldn't go on any longer. It's about an Amish girl named Meribah Simon who goes on the emigrant trail to the gold rush with her father who is being shunned by the community. That is basically all I know that happened because I couldn't finish it! Don't read this book! I'm warning you!
1,Not worth the money,Purchased this item to protect my dexter cows. Very small pasture and not much area to cover. Worked great for about 3 months then nothing. No output at all. Trying to get repacement. Piece of junk. Not again.
3,Edger blades.,Not to bad. I found ones at home depot for a lot less. Get the job done. None of these seem to last so stock up when you get a deal.
3,Works fine,"I have bought several of these through the years. They fit well and shipping is always prompt.However, the blades wear quickly. I understand that these blades WILL wear, but they have noticeable wear after a each use."
5,Two of their most important albums on one CD.,"The two LPs reissued on this CD were released in 1976 and 1977. Both remain among The O'Jays' most successful and dearly-loved recordings and still sound wonderful today. Such anthems as ""Message In Our Music"", ""Darlin' Darlin' Baby"", ""A Prayer"", ""Paradise"", ""Work On Me"", the ageless ""We're All In This Thing Together"" and ""Let Life Flow"" are among the greatest recordings of 1970s R&B, Indispensable!"
4,Ld,"So far this product is working very good . Water is clear ,do not see any slug in basins. Will use this again."
5,Pond care product.,"This product worked medium well for me, but I have a very difficult pond to keep clean as it is a somewhat swampy area, and I feel I got my moneys worth 100%!"
2,Less than expected,"I love Daft Punk, this DVD is simply 5 music videos...that is it. No remixes, nothing. Just a lot of commentary...the music and videos are still great but I don't think I'd buy it again if I had the chance."
2,Emergency Shallow,"The writing is shallow and so is the story. Sort of like Jerry Bruckheimer in a book. If you like Bruckheimer movies, you might like this book. Otherwise it isn't worth the time."
2,Emergency Yawn!!!!!,Dimercurio badmouths Clancy for not being a real sub guy. At least Clancy can tell a story. Emergency Deep does a crash dive into boredom and never recovers.
1,It Sucks...period.,I got given this piece of garbage by a buddy who now seriously owes me a beer to make up for it. I read it on a flight to LA and it put me to sleep. Hack crap. Forget it.
5,Wonderful read,"It's been 20 years since I last read this book, and I've read literally hundreds of books since, but this book has stayed with me, and I am very glad to have found it again. This is one of those books that, when you loan it out, it NEVER comes back. It's history, science fiction, mythology, philosophy and religious thought all rolled into one wonderful read."
5,My First Two Thousand Years - a book with staying power!,"This is my first visit to Amazon.Com - I thought I would see just how good its database is by checking for one of my all time favorite books... one which I thought was out of print. Much to my delight, My First Two Thousand Years has been reprinted! My copy is one obtained about 33 years ago at a used book sale... the publication date on my copy is 1928. This book is 70 years old, but the story is as fresh as if it had just been written. I believe I will re-read it now.I recommend this book as a historical adventure. Men and women both will enjoy this - I know because after I first read it many years ago I got my girlfriend (now my wife) to read it and she was as fascinated by the story as I was."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"With the exception of the first chapter, this book has had to be the most dry and poorly written informative book ever. This book makes WAY too many references, and often unnecessarily because the author depends on them. Almost every other paragraph is about a reference to another book, and actual information (NOT references) is extremely hard to come by.Most of this book is pretty much a giant collection of summaries of OTHER books, with extremely limited analysis as to its significance. If you are not familiar with at least half of the references (to books and to people you probably never heard of), this is a nightmare to read. In summary, painful to read, dry, and plain horrible.If I had the money, I would buy every single copy of this book and burn it so that people don't have to go through the horrors of reading this book."
1,$38.00???? Overcharge,"This sells for $19. Look elsewhere on Amazon, etc. I have used a similar product Sure-Drive I think it is called."
5,Solid and Predictable,"When buying Corelle, you know what you're getting, which is solid everyday dishes. There is nothing spectacular as this is not fine china. However, the product is pleasing to the eye, durable and serves our daily needs. I've always been happy with Corelle."
5,"Just as they said, only faster","The dinnerware set was well packaged and looked just as pictured. Also, it arrived sooner than the shipping statement led me to believe. For anyone not familiar with Corelle, it is both as rugged as the manufacture claims, and the dishes stack with no space in between, which save space in my cabinet."
4,Mom's ultra-light dishes,"On a cold grey Minnesota winter day the Corelle sunflower dishes were a delight to unpack, wash and store in my mom's kitchen cabinet."
5,a very good guide for women's golf,I learned so much from this book. The author really knows her golf and how to teach it simply. The pictures help a lot in understanding the technique to better golf. I have improved my scores by at least 5 strokes since studying her concepts. It sure make golf a lot more fun!
2,If you know what you are doing....,"No instructions come with this book. If you know what you are doing for example from doing a 'New York Beauty' then you will be on the right path. If not, making these squares will be a long difficult process. Lots of wasted material, frustration and ripping along the way. Better to take a class along with the book if you are not an experienced sewer. Hope this helps. Beautiful pictures and inspiration!"
3,Quilt book,"Lovely patterns. Haven't started one yet, but have several picked out to give a shot. therefore can't comment on the ease or thoroughness of the directions."
2,Crunchy beans?,"Twice now, I have attempted to make a bean soup with these beans. I have followed all instructions - rinse, soak for a few hours, rinse again, and then soak overnight. Once they go in the crock pot, though, they never fully cook and always end up slightly crunchy. I do not know what the issue is, it may very well be me instead of the product, but I have tried other brands with no issues. It's a shame, really, as I enjoy Bob's Red Mill products a lot!"
3,"BEANS, BEANS.... and more beans....","Nice mix of beans, but NOT soup. It does say that in the fine print, but why it's called soup mix I don't know. It is simply a bag of 13 kinds of dry beans which must be washed, soaked, and cooked for hours just like any other dry beans. It apparently has no added seasonings or such to make it a true soup. Maybe having thirteen types of dry beans in one bag is a convenience, however it states they are best kept refrigerated or frozen!!! This is a real disappointment. I will not reorder this 13 Bean (so-called) Soup Mix."
2,"PRICES GOING UP, UP, UP, DOWN A LITTLE","I really like this soup although I have to lower my 5 star rating to 2 stars. The last time I paid $15.63 and today I received an E-Mail advertisement for $20.74, a 33% price increase. By the way, Bob's Red Mill Soup Bean Seasoning increased a whopping 48% up to $47.55. When you get an E-Mail about one of your favorite products that Amazon tracks, don't just assume they're passing on a price bargain!UPDATE: Two days later after my original post the price has now decreased by $1.33 to $19.41. I'm a seasoned Amazon customer who is generally very satisfied. Although after following the price fluctuations I kind of feel like I'm involved in the stock market."
5,grrrreat,"Really great. Don't forget to add your own customizing goodies such as frozen corn, sun-dried tomatoes, cashews, etc.Keep it in the freezer!"
4,A lot of beans in this soup,"Yes, Bob's Red Mill 13 bean soup mix is more expensive than if you were to assemble the beans yourself. However, this mix conveniently puts the 13 beans together and offers recipes on the back suggesting how to prepare it. The mix doesn't come with spices - it is beans only - so you will have to come up with everything else yourself.This is a good product if you are cooking for a crowd, or if you really, really love beans. One bag makes a large pot of soup. But if you are cooking for a smaller crowd, you might find yourself getting tired of bean soup pretty quickly.I liked the soup the first time I made it. But one package filled my bean quota for a while. The remaining packages have remained on the shelf."
2,"Backbone of the Wehrmacht, Vol. II: Sniper Variations of the German K98k Rifle","A great attempt when first published. I knew Richard Law and admired his work. The book is now very dated, with many mistakes and some rifles that are outright fakes. There is no chance of an updated edition since Richard died many years ago."
2,Reviews not all for same book!?,"I am WWI & WWII historical collector of information, photos, medals, weapons, books etc. While reading the amazon reviews for Richard D. Law's Backbone of Wehrmacht Vol.2, I see many reviews are listed as based on his earlier book, not Vol.2! Why would the source for these reviews mix up the two different books? While I'm very certain both books by Mr. Law are absolutely great, it is not proper to assume anything about Vol.2 by reviewing a different book even if it was written/prepared by the same author. I hope there has been a misprint and my comments are therefore wrong..."
4,Daughter got for Xmas and loves it,"My 23 month old never had a ride on toy at home before. We never had room in our old house. She got this for Christmas and loves it. It is very cute. It is a bit loud, though. Luckily, my husband is an engineer so he took it apart and rigged a muffler on the speaker with a piece of paper towel and tape, I think. But my daughter is really enjoying it."
2,please no,"Bought this to cook easy, tasty dishes. Tried a couple of recipes-- and it's hit or miss. The dishes taste the same, and half were downright inedible."
2,nothing special,"I don't listen to the radio anymore because of the ... that is out there --- I get my new music by recommendations by others on Amazon; other people's lists and ""people who bought this also bought....""So, I was led to Greenwheel from pages that included Chevelle and Breaking Benjamin (both bands I really like). After listening to Soma Holiday a couple of times, I can say that there is nothing special about Greenwheel. Nothing really new. I look for and enjoy explosive guitars and great riffs and interesting, syncopated drums. Nothing like this here. Simple, simple music. I do like the scratchy-ness of the vocals, but that is about it. The music is, again, so simple. Pretty boring, actually.If you want pap, by all means, pick this up. I'm still searching for what I am looking for. Greenwheel isn't it."
4,'Soma Holiday' is a Gift...,"Greenwheel explodes onto the music scene with their debut album 'Soma Holiday'. After hearing them on the Spider-Man soundtrack I was interested to see what they could bring to the table and when I found the album I picked it up. The first couple of listens didn't really intrigue me all that much but I continued on listening and listening, somewhere around 10 listens I found that I was in love with this album. Two weeks later I had the opportunity to see them live with Blindside and Hoobastank (both worth checking out), their live show is as awesome as this album. Pick up this album, kick back, and enjoy!!"
5,BEST NEW BAND OUT THERE,"Greenwheel is the best new band out there right now, they are touring all over the country and making new fans everywhere. their new cd Soma Holiday is amazing. every song is unique and emotion-filled. No one can sing like Ryan, and the instruments are played with emotion and polish. this band is going to be in your face for a long time. hope you enjoy the ride. hope they do too."
5,Great CD... and an even better show!,"Soma Holiday is wonderful. There is so much power and emotion behind songs like ""Breathe"", ""Shelter"" and ""Radiance"". If you like rock at all, you will love Greenwheel. (And they totally rocked Summerfest 2002!!)"
5,A Must Have!!,"Soma Holiday is a must have for every music collection, especially every Rock collection. Each song becomes addictive almost instantly!! The lyrics can be felt by anyone no matter what age, etc. I highly reccommend this CD and if you get a chance check these guys out live because they definitely ROCK!!"
1,no identity,"i saw these clowns late last year with two other ""up and coming"" bands...rubyhorse and flickerstick. let me just say that while flickerstick was the reason we went to the show (from seeing them win bands on the run) and were solid, rubyhorse were outstanding! meanwhile, greenwheel were the most generic sounding band i have heard in a long time. they will be soon forgotten, along with band like default and a bunch of others i already can't remember. if you're into anything interesting in your rock, stay away from greenwheel."
3,Who copied Who?,"While this is an excellent rock debut, there are some uncanny coicidences between this and Melissa Etheridge's recent release Lucky. The main one is the song ""Breathe."" While it sounds more like an Etheridgesque song, both versions are good. I don't know who to believe. We first heard it come Greenwheel, but then heard it from the veteran rocker, but who do we believe? I can't say, but either way I still like this cd in it's entirety. It's a good buy from an up and coming band."
4,"Good, but flawed","This MP3 player is good value for money: 20GB, nice design, excellent sound quality.However, there are several irritating problems. 1. Dust behind the screen, straight out of the box. 2. Picture quality isn't great (This is the Zen Sleek Photo, after all). 3. The big problem: It crashes occasionally, (blank screen, no signs of life, won't charge OR all the lights on, no response, won't turn off). The first time this happened, I thought it was dead and would have to be returned to Amazon. In fact, it needed to be reset by inserting a pin or paperclip into the hole beside the USB socket. This is not explained adequately in the manual, and I had to check the Creative website to find this out. It seems to crash when it has been connected to my computer via USB.Despite this extremely irritating problem, I don't regret buying the Zen Sleek Photo. It sounds great, and the capacity is fantastic for the price."
4,"Awesome Product, but unfortunately......","This prodeuct is an excelent buy! Great clear sound, especially with the smart sound. I turned it up all the way and absolutely no distortion!! I love that it has an optional background. You can put pictures in it and set them as your background. Everything is perfect about except that after about 3 weeks my fm radio stopped working!! also every now and then it will skip a little bit. It will be playing a song and it will be almost at the end and then will start playing something in the begining of the song. But that is very rare. I also dont like that you need both the USB and the addaptor cords to charge it. But It has amazing battery life! All and all I deffinately reccomend this product."
4,Good enough,"Yes it is really good enough with this money...I have only 2 negative thoughts about it...First, it works only with Windows XP and I really cant understand why it is so...Second, The main menu touchpad is very sensitive and sometimes it is hard to enter the submenus...Besides these negatives, it has a lot of positive feature...Thank You Amazon...."
4,"After 18 Months, Still Satisfied","I previously had an iriver, which was very frustrating to synchronize and broke after about a year. Upgraded to this unit, which I have been extremely pleased with. I sync through Windows Media Player and it works perfectly and quickly. Sound is great, unit is pretty durable, battery life is pretty good. My only complaint is that the screen is hard to see in sunlight, which was actually a strength of the iriver. I also dislike the touchpad and was extremely frustrated with it at first (even after setting it to the least sensitive level), but grew accustomed to it after a couple of months.I have used up the 20 GB and am now in the market for a 30 GB or larger unit. I'm surprised there aren't more to pick from."
4,Better than an iPod but...,"I really wish it would display the album art when it plays the music. Otherwise, it fulfilled everything else I wanted. It was inexpensive, small, good capacity, shuffles quickly, good randomization and sounds great."
1,Don't buy it!,"It works pretty well until it crashes. I bought this because I heard good things about it, as well as the fact that I hate iTunes. But one day after I got it, it crashed and I couldn't turn it on and my computer told me it had ""malfunctioned"". I returned it and got a new one, which also crashed about a week later. I'm definitely not getting another one of these."
4,Zen 20GB photo review,If you are looking for a new mp3 player like i was and contiplating the ipod or creative.. i would say go for this mp3 player. Cons.. It has frozen up on me about 3 or 4 times in 2 months. Its a lot bigger than an ipod. The touch pad is not that hard to get use to the first couple days it is difficult but once you get use to it its fine. The earbuds that come with the player are very uncomfortable they are loud but uncomfortable. Buy this mp3 player you wont regret it... 20 gb is plenty of space..pros.. bigger clearer screen then an ipod way more capacity for the money. you dont have to use itunes which itunes in itself is a pain. if you are thinking about buying a really nice mp3 get this one!
4,Great---but!,"This is a great product. Despite what others say the touchpad is easy to use. It's fun to look at and play with. The FM radio is hella cool too.However....make sure your computer is up to snuff with all the updates needed, otherwise you're in for frustration. AND if you need the updates, make sure your version of Windows is legitimate, otherwise you're going to shell out another 150 bucks to make it so."
4,"It is not the best, but definitely good.","Its a good buy for less than $170.I had no issues with the player so far.Sound quality is very good, and all the extra features like FM, voice recorder, alarm, organizer and the 20GB capacity adds its overall appeal.The 2 cable design (1 for usb, a separate one for charge) is a bit weak.Vertical touch pad is challenge to get used to - if you set the sensitivity of the touchpad to low, its easily usable."
3,Was good while it lasted,"At first when I purchased this item, I was one of the main ones stating what a gem this was and how i loved this gadget but that has changed. My player has gone capoeee. The sound is literally gone, all i get is an echo and a faint sound of the music but the lyrics are gone. i have tried troubleshooting it and doing all Creative Labs recommended but to no avail."
2,Very Disappointed,"I am a former Mac user who went over to the Dark Side with the purchase of a laptop PC which I love. When it came time to finally buy an MP3 Player, I researched everything I could and I chose the Creative Zen because of the price, the capabilities and that it has a radio. The second day I had it, after downloading 35 cds, it would not turn on. I finally had to stick a pin in the reset hole and then the screen was filled with unrecognizable characters. I ended up having to download the firmware on a ONE DAY OLD machine. I figured it was ""User Error"" even though I did nothing wrong. Today, a full two weeks since I bought the &*^!! thing, it won't turn on again. Same problems PLUS the PC wouldn't recognize the USB connection.I love my Toshiba Laptop and won't go back to a Mac but my next MP3 will be an iPod.Now I hope Amazon will accept this back and give me either a refund or credit!"
3,Value for money but not desirable,"After a lot of research and review, i bought this product for my friend and he was happy with the item. The features of this product are good but when it comes to accessibility and handy, I would not recommend this product becasue it's bulky and keys to access Menus are not good. After few tries, i got irritated with the product.If i have to recommend someone for an MP3 player with all features except photo and video, it would be mobiBlu. I personally don't like watching photos and videos in a small screen."
1,Very bad experience.,"I was very excited when I bought the Zen Sleek Photo; the screen is bright, the music sounds excellent. Unfortunately, navigation is horrible. The touch pad design causes constant false selections, sometimes interrupting (and basically deleting from the playlist) the music you are already playing. I can't imagine a test panel NOT complaining about this abysmal design. I guess Creative just did not listen. Then, to boot, the unit crashed after 10 days of owning it. My computer no longer recognizes it, and the screen is black. I am currently in the process of returning it. Please, save yourself the hassle (and shipping costs) and buy something else."
2,Do not buy it. And I will not buy any Creative in the future.,"I bought this on May 30, its FM radio failed on july. Each time, when I turned on automatic tuning, it will stuck and I have to reset it and continue listening to the music. Starting this month, I even could not turn it on, the only way to turn it on was to reset it. But today, even reset did not work. What a garbage product. I will buy a Apply to replace it."
4,Good mp3 player,"I recently purchased the Creative Zen Sleek photo mp3 player. It was a good purchase. It's moderately priced, easy to use and has a rechargeable battery similar to that of a cell phone that gives 15 or 16 hours of playback if used wisely. And with 20 GB of storage, one can take several hundred hours if music in the palm of your hand! I would venture to say it is as good a buy if not better than the ipod."
2,Okay mp3 player,"This mp3 player is okay. There are more con's then pro's but it still manages to be an alright media player.cons1.Battery life is really bad (It usually last about 1 1/2 hours at the most)2.Freezes up more then it should3.Outdated model (can't buy accessories for i from creative anymore)4.Its really compared to other mp3 players5.Can only hold about 5,000 mp3 files6.Creative says the battery can last about 19 hours on a full charge mine last about 1 1/2 hours7.only a 90 day warranty(if you buy it new)Pro's1.Can use more then one program(unlike ipods)2.You can change the color theme3.good audio quality4.Doesn't cost alot of money for a mp3 player that can hold pictures and musicIf you really want to get a better mp3 player get the creative zen V:plusholds short video clips, music, photos all for about $185(8 gig)"
3,entertaining but not cativating,"was an interesting book, however as i not educated in the various types of magick terms they used in the book, some of the passages were a bit vague for me to follow. this was cause for a bit of lost interest in places. however, the characters were vivid and the shop description intriguing.the tone of the stories were a bit sad as most ended in melencholy. if i see a book of Ms. Trobe's again in the bargain bin i will pick it up but probably not purchase it for full price. however, she will have a following for those who like this type of prose."
1,Short Life,"I have to echo the original review. In fact, mine lasted exactly 18 months. These things DO NOT LAST! However, it works fine for 18 months. After that, it just DIES. HP is lagging badly in quality the last few years, and this product is a good example."
1,died too soon,"Like others, my experience was that it worked very well while it lasted which was about 12 months. Very disappointed and lowered my impression of HP."
1,What is the warranty?,"Editorial ReviewsThe HP ScanJet 4200Cse offers fast plug-and-play installation through the USB port, and is backed by a one-year warranty on parts and labor.FAQWhat kind of warranty does Hewlett-Packard offer on the HP ScanJet 4200Cse?HP offers a 90-day limited warranty on the HP ScanJet 4200Cse."
2,Had to resolder the interior power connector.,"Found my old, dead HP 4200 scanner today while cleaning out a closet and tried to get it working again. Noticed the voltage of 12 volts DC stopped at where you connect the power plug in at the back of the scanner. Disassembled scanner and noticed only a 1 volt reading on the interior of the plug. Should have been 12 volts like the power source was sending to it. Resoldered the input connector on the 4200's electronic circuit board and now the machine might work. The scanner lights up now when plugged in and my old 1999 laptop Presario (model 1600) running Windows 98 recognizes it as a new device. It's been a while since it was used and I can't find the software disk that came with it anywhere. Maybe I can find a free disk or download somewhere and put the scanner back into service."
1,beware!,The scanner was easy to use when you could get the software to operate properly. More often than not it would not bring up the program...and then it died. I would not purchase this product or any other HP scanner again. Although I love my HP printer.
2,"When you can get it to work, the HP4200cse does a great job.","I have had nothing but problems trying to use this scanner. The software constantly locks up. A message is then displayed stating that the scanner cannot be found. The light stays on. There is a patch on the HP site. It however, did not correct the problem. When and if you can get it to work, it does a fantastic job. Very good resolution and accurate colors. Sometimes you can remove the software and then reload it to get the scanner to work. If you are lucky and it starts you had better do all your scanning as it may not work once you have gone to a different application and try again to use it. I am very disappointed with HP's customer support. If the product is over 90 days old, it costs an arm and leg to talk with anyone. I plan to replace it with an Epson 1200."
1,Non-stop problems,"I had this scanner for less than 6 months, and had non-stop problems with it. It would work OK for a while, but then the software would hang (I'd get a message saying that the computer could not find the scanner). For a while, reinstalling the software in ""safe"" mode worked, but eventually even that didn't work. HP tech support was useless (even after long distance calls to their Colorado help center). I finally gave up and bought an Epson 1200, which is awesome -- better resolution, no software glitches, and a competitive price.One thing to be wary of is the warranty on this scanner -- I think it's only 90 days. That's usually not a good sign!"
1,Good while it lasted...,"I bought this scanner < 2 years ago & it died on my within about 18 months of light to moderate use. While it was working, it did a nice job, however. Buyer beware -- life of this product may be extremely limited."
1,Totally Displeased,Product failed to work after only a couple of x's using. Computerdoes not recognize scanner program. After numerous attempts ofreaching HP for help they informed me they don't know why its notworking with no advice for further help. So basically a brand newscanner is worthless. Which is what I would say about their techsupport as well!!
3,Interesting interpretations and views of reasoning,All interpretations are subjective and persuaded by many concepts. I find the book an interesting view of one aspect of the words of Jesus aka Eashoa Msheekha. It is worthwhile to have many views to ponder and meditate upon and through these processes the meanings of those written words regarding the teachings of Jesus(Eashoa Msheekha) become clearer.
1,Disappointing,"I bought this book because of the Footprint reputation, but itwas a big disaqppointment to me. The information was several years out of date, the text was loaded with typos and misinformation, and the layout of the individual sections was confusing. Too much time was spent on small out-of-the-way villages for my tastes, and too little time on the major sights, such as Machu Picchu, Lima, and Nazca. We were very disappointed in the restaurant reviews, and three of the ones we tried to go to had either closed or had never been there in the first place, according to locals. Finally, we didn't get as strong a sense of the country as we wanted, so the book was an all-out loser from our point of view. If I were to do it again, I'd go for the Lonely Planet's Peru book over this one."
4,Strongly Recommended,This review is digested. The full review of Footprint Peru 4th edition is above this review. It is a top rated guide. You will do well with the purchase of this guide. Strongly recommended
4,A book for everyone planning a trip to Peru,"The book goes through the whole country. Information about where to go, where to stay and eat. It describes all interesting places and how to get to them. Accurate information about hotels, tour companies, restaurants, (with rates and price classes) and infrastructure. The book gives a good overview of the country and its people and culture."
2,Best Forgotten,I found this to be a very slow moving story and very repetitive. I didn't like the ending at all nor the way the revelations were just brushed off like they never happened. But the biggest trouble maker of the whole story was dealt with as should be in the end. What a weak character Jeff actually was but he was painted to be so noble. Give this one a glance and move on.
2,Havn't I heard this before?,"Music is in a sad period. And unfortunatly, metal/hardcore is no exception. Its not so much a lack of talent. Just a lack of creativity and originality. These guys are technically talented but they sound so cliche. Their sound is about as original as the girl pants and tight plaid shirts they wear. They sound pretty much like every other hardcore band I've ever heard. Not really worth getting excited over unless you want to ""bring the mosh."" If you want to listen to some good metal/hardcore try black dahlia murder, lamb of god, or cephalic carnage instead."
1,Not as seen on the picture,"I bought 2 sets of this speedo ear plugs. Those 2 sets shipped to me are different as shown online. They aren't that comfortable while plug into the ears, the rings of the rubber are a little too thick and hard."
3,OK but not the best,"I like the case better the ear plugs. I found the ear plugs to be stiff and uncomfortable. When the plastic hinge broke on the case for my Aqua Sphere ear plugs, I moved them into the case from the Speedos - so not a total waste. Aqua Sphere plugs are softer and more comfortable - and cheaper too!"
1,Speedo Rubber Ear Plugs,"I read the reviews that they didn't feel good and still ordered them thinking it would be different for my ears. Well it wasn't. These ear plugs hurt. The plastic is too hard and doesn't give. So it really feels annoying. Hurts and doesn't feel comfortable at all. Take my word for it. They need to come up with a new ear plug shaped just like this one; but made of of flexible rubber that will hold the water out, but feel good in the ear. I definitely wouldn't recommend this ear plug."
1,Very Uncomfortable and Ineffective,These earplugs hurt to wear. They also shift because they're so stiff so you end up with water in your ears. Don't waste your money on these - go for the more flexible plastic earplugs!!
1,misrepresented!!!,"These ear plugs I feel were misrepresented in that the picture shows one type (the kind I wanted), but what was sent to me was not at all what was in the picture. I did return them without any difficulty."
2,"Cheap, and it shows","Very uncomfortable, hard plastic with a sliver of rubber.Spend the extra few bucks and get some nicer ones."
2,stiff and not effecient,i bought these a yr ago they hurt your ear and sm amount of water does enter ur ear .... not a good purchase
2,Speedo Swimming Ear Plugs,"I don't like these at all. They are not very comfortable and do not keep out the water entirely. Would not buy again, if I kept the receipt I'd return (bought from a sporting goods store)."
3,"OK, and a good value","These are OK ear plugs. They do the job and, while not as comfortable as other brands, it's a good value. Wish there was some tint to the product -- drop one, and it's REAL hard to find!"
4,Better for me than Aqua Sphere.,"I bought a pair of these from Sports Authority. They aren't entirely comfortable, but water never gets into my ears.The Aqua Sphere plugs someone else mentions in a review, I ordered from Amazon, and they're *much* more comfortable... but didn't keep all the water out of my ears, which made me pretty unhappy in the pool.I've ordered a few more sets of these."
1,Painful,"These are too thick and stiff so when inserted to the ears, they're sooo painful - especially when opening my mouth when breathing in. Should stick with rubber ones, like Mack's."
2,Empiricism Squared,"Quine tells a fascinating story about translation. His is not a lazy mind.His assumption (or belief) that language is learned completely through experience is simply false. Ample evidence drawn from experiments in psychology, neuro-physics, and even common sense demonstrate otherwise. Like the English philosophers who wrote about language and cognition centuries before him, his work will be found to be historically interesting, but ultimately dated; one might say, in the field of linguistics, pre-Copernicus."
4,High Interest Reading for Teen With Limited Literacy Skills,"From the back of the Pacesetters edition -Danger On The Streets of San FranciscoThe woman in the yellow car had tried to kill him. But why? He had not done anything wrong. All he had done was deliver a few packages for Howard Arden, one of the richest men in San Francisco. Bob didn't even know what was in the packages. But he knew that he had better find out. Before it was too late.""A story with a surprise a minute. You won't want to put it down""The Pacesetters series is high interest reading for those who have literacy problems, or who just have a reluctance to read. The reading level for these books is between 2 and 3. Many of these books are mentioned in reference material concerning High/Low materials."
3,Not as good as the other Waverly novels,"I've read all of Kakonis's novels, and this book, while OK, was the weakest. It seemed more formulaic, and the violence more gratuitous. However, the villain, the psychopathic Ignatius ""Eggs"" La Revere, is one of Kakonis's most memorable bad guys."
5,Very good book for beginners,I did not know a thing about SAS programming before I got hold of this book. This book is very simple to read. You learn the basics of SAS programming with the minimum of effort. It comes with a data disk that contains all the data sets you need to do the exercises in the book. This saves you the trouble of typing in the data. I strongly recommend this book.
4,Datasets all present now,The problem with some datasets being not available has been taken care of by Duxbury. This is a good reference for those beginning students who need to use SAS and who want some guidance by example of how to implement selected statistical procedures using SAS.
1,Avoid this book,"Overall this is a poorly written book. It has some good examples, but the breadth of coverage is very limited. It is also necessary to read ahead in the book to be able to complete exercises at the end of each module and many needed commands are not listed (such as viewing data structure). It also gives little instruction on how to read in data outside of sas with only one example of .xls files and no example of ascII. Do not adopt this as the sole requirement for a programming class, check Cody for better materials."
4,Pretty good.,"Pretty good SAS book, a tip the author has a solutions manual on her website in case you get stuck while coding."
2,"It works, but noisy.","It does have some okay effects and it's easy to use but the output is very noisy. If you're looking for good vocal effects, get a Lexicon, or a quality mixer with on-board effects; Yamaha, Mackie."
4,"Forget The Fear, It`s ALL About The Babes !","The title and cover are slightly misleading, as this dvd is a loosely-knit string of videos w/ attractive babes in kinky outfits, one or two of which are occult-themed. The ladies are all pro-strippers, as their motions would dictate, and we get to see them undress seductively - it`s just like going to a titty-bar (can I say that here?) without leaving your house, which isn`t a bad thing, necessarily. Some of the outfits and women are quite alluring and, thankfully, none go on for too long. But there isn`t a word spoken during the entire outing, it`s all performed to a music track. It clocks in at under an hour, more or less, and I don`t know if that`s a good thing or not - more may have been tedious, but I DID want more being the gluttonous fool that I am. Your call..."
1,Not a vampire movie,"This isn't a vampire movie. It's just some strippers.I really wish that I had read the reviews or watched the preview before I bought it, but I didn't. I was looking for a cheap horror movie and thought this was one."
1,Fear Girls Volume One,"I give this movie one star because it was extremely boring with no storyline and no action, there was no point to the movie."
1,Waste of money,"Just as the title says. No plot or acting. Just some naked girls, and they are ugly ones 3/10 in the looks department. Go elsewhere for your thrills! If desptite my warning you rent this, please return to say you found my review helpful."
3,More product info,Granted its self explanatory but it doesnt mention how many test strips you are getting? is there only 1 or 5?
4,"Delightful letters, but no advice","I read this book because I wanted to learn the art of fine letter writing of olden times that is spoken of so often. Unfortunately, there was nothing of this nature in this book. However there were a couple dozen letters that were absolutely delightful to read. It was interesting to see not only how people expressed themselves, but to see what went on during their lives and what they put to paper whereas today we might use another medium. It's a very quick read and a great deal of fun."
2,worked for about 5 minutes,"worked for about 5 minutes then stopped working as advertized, always on even with no switch signal. installed a kill switch instead."
1,Anti-Mormon book-not given that info or wouldn't have ordered,I thought I was buying a book from the early days of the Mormon church and instead received an anti-Mormon book. I would prefer to make my own decisions and not take those of someone else who may have a hidden agenda. I am very upset over this because it was misleading information on the purchase page.
5,An excellent anthology,"One would think that the field of philosophy that is concerned with the nature of truth would be an area that has been thoroughly worked over for many years. In fact, unlike ontology and epistemology and other fields, it does not even have a proper name. It has however, in recent years been a fertile one in the Analytic tradition. Lynch's reader provides the seminal articles along with important classics in the broader discipline that are a must for any one wanting to reflect upon this critical subject. Also included are helpful introductory essays and diagrams."
1,You can only take so much coyote howling...,"If you can get past the Old Man's hideously annoying, constant coyote cackle, then you can say to yourself, as I did, ""Well, at least the Iranians tried.""The gal's pretty hot, though."
1,Poorly made - no quality control,"Lamp arrived in box marked with correct, rust, model number, but on opening, it was a black lamp, not rust. Additionally, one of the glass panels was loose (fell out in the box) and when I removed it, I found that it was smaller than the rest of the glass panels and could not possibly fit in the fixture. The build quality of this lamp is also poor. I'd suggest finding some other lamp, perhaps by a different manufacturer."
5,Very durable,"The product is very durable. At first, I couldn't decide if I should buy folding or non-folding and finally bought the non-folding model. I am glad that I went with non-folding, because I cannot see myself carrying this rebounder on trips since it is quite big. Nonetheless, I love it. I wish they included some sort of training/exercise CD rather than a book."
3,Needak brand,"The Needak brand rebounder is something you might want to consider. Unlike the treadmill, it requires no electricity and you will still get great results in terms of health. It is a medium-priced model that includes a water-proof vinyl cover which may emit a strong chemical odor. Place outdoors when it first arrives to avoid headaches and be on your way to increased health and well-being."
5,Great quality product!,Works as intended and built to last. Book and video included is a very nice touch! Looking forward to doing business with them again. They have my recommendation!!
3,"1st recipe, no way, maybe the next recipe will be better","I bought this ice cream cookbook based on the 2 review previous to mine and wanting an ice cream cookbook that my daughter didn't have. Once I received it I compared it to my daughters 2 ice cream cookbooks by Williams Sonoma's collection and the other from Ben & Jerry's. I preferred theirs over this one. The recipe 'Favorite Peach Ice Cream', I've made better with a recipe from another ice cream cookbook. But I'll try another recipe and maybe I'll love that recipe and end up likeing this book after all."
4,It is what it is!,"The product is what it advertise to be. If you expect it to taste as fresh eggs you will be disappointed. Nevertheless, you can make great omelettes and scramble eggs concoctions. Easy to mix and cook. After mixing with water it looks thinner than regular eggs, but it cooks well. If you are not sure, order powdered eggs in a smaller package and try it first. Will definitely buy again once it runs out."
1,Nasty!,"I did not think it would be so nasty. Now I am stuck with a bunch of this powder, and the only use i can find is baking where you cant really tell the difference."
5,Very satisfied with this product!,I am suprisingly delighted with the quality of this product.It was everything it was advertised to be.The ease of use and good taste was a great extra!
4,"Great Product, Great Price","After looking at various dried egg products, we decided to purchase Honeyville Farms product.It was priced very competitive and arrived quickly. We tried it last weekend as scrambled eggs and they tasted great.One tip for scrambled eggs, use milk instead of water and whip the eggs to get some aiir into the mix."
2,Honeyville vs. Others,Tried these and liked them. Tried OvaEasy when these were out of stock for so long and liked the OvaEasy much better. Tasted more like fresh eggs. Just my 2 cents.
4,Great for a large group to feed.,"As someone who has taken up backpacking this summer, I have dived head-first into recipies beyond that of trail mixes. Alot has been written about the taste of powdered eggs vs. that of regular eggs, all I can say is that there is a definite difference-but just remember-when you're in the middle of nowhere-this product will take care of your craving for eggs. The product comes in a coffee-can sized tin that probabily take an individual like myself about a whole season of weekly camping to go through. This product would be great for those trips with a group of people to cook for. I've also tried the product in baked recipies with a fair amount of success"
3,Not surreal enough,"This book turned out to be not so surreal as I hoped.(There are more exciting and colorful, more twisted and thought-provoking books written in style of surrelism.)Overal narration here is a bit slow, sometimes it's simply dragging."
2,Fades in the stretch,"For a good portion of its length, this tale is everything one could want: deliciously witty in a zany way sometimes reminiscent of the Marx Brothers at their best. The difficulty, for me, at any rate, is that it doesn't really come to a proper conclusion, though Heaven knows there are climactic events a-plenty toward the end. But the comedic tone falls victim to A Message. When authors choose to deliver A Message to their readers, it bodes ill; when they can be seen to be almost screechingly yanking on the brake lever to pause their story in mid-run to get to The Message, worse yet.All in all, this is a book certainly worth reading, and I recommend it; but its failure to sustain its original tone makes it a bit disappointing. I will be interested to see what some of her other work is like."
1,Full of mistakes,"I bought this back in 2007, but finally got around reading it.This book has no preface, no pictures, and the page where a chapter starts has the chapter name but no number.It also has mistakes, such as repeated sentences. The Chapter Mein Herr seems to appear in two places, and the flow is not there.As it says, the pages are easy to read. That is very true. However, i would not buy this edition, it is very shoddy work."
1,"Useless, use a damp sponge instead.",If a Chalk eraser should do one thing it would be to erase chalk. Save your money and buy a sponge.
5,Like This Eraser,This eraser does what it is supposed to do. I like and am verypleased with this purchase. Arrived in timely fashion and if ishould ever need any more products of this nature i will be areturning customer for the seller of this product.
2,Doesn't erase well. Ugly label is painted on.,"Individual chalkboard erasers are difficult to find locally, so I ordered 3 of these because my blackboard is guaranteed to last 50 years, and I thought I'd better get at least a few to last a while... They erase poorly, leaving visible letters and a thick coating of chalk on the board. Paper towels work very well on my blackboard made of black porcelain over steel. The erasers were a waste of money.What attracted me to this eraser was the wooden handle. I mistakenly thought that the red & white painted-on design was just a paper label that I could peel off to reveal the wood design so that it would resemble an old-fashioned eraser. The label makes it look childish."
3,It works..,that is about all I can say. The $1.50 earser that I bought at a hobby store works just as well.
3,these are okay...,"Not the quality I expected... I paid a pretty good price for this product but I thought it would be thicker for some reason. But if you are buying it for a child it's great... Not for teachers, commercial use."
4,Good eraser for little hands.,Lightweight and sized for the usual Melissa and Doug crowd. Does the job. Only con is the price. I would go elsewhere if I was getting an eraser for older children.
4,Not terrible,"It's fine. It does what it is supposed to do - erase a chalkbaord. It's smaller than I expected and not really as sturdy as I would have liked but hey, the price was right. Overall, I am happy with this purchase."
4,great for easels,"my stepdaughter got an easel for xmas and loves that she can write all over her easel and use the chalk and I'm happy that we got this, cuz she can start over every morning. :D"
5,Cool Eraser,Cool old school eraser. Simple felt eraser with a wooden back. Goes great with the rest of the rest of the Melissa and Doug stuff.
4,"It works, but.....","Its an eraser!!! no suprise there.. lol We bought it to go with our Melissa and Doug everything else, but really, if you see one cheaper but it. This one does not do anything special."
5,Works great,"My daughter got a chalkboard/easel for her birthday & it came with one of those erasers that claims it works for both chalk & dry erase boards. As you can guess, that eraser didn't work for our chalkboard. So we bought this one - problem solved."
3,"easy for little hands to hold, not a good eraser","My kids can hold this easily enough, but it does a poor job of actualy cleaning off the board and then my kids end up using thier hands, which defeats the purpose for this item."
3,was okay,worked okay but fell apart after few uses. not really good product does not last very long. was okay while lasted
4,Works great,It's a chalk eraser. It erases nicely and has lasted over a year without any problems. Anything Melissa & Doug is great quality.
3,Not Like Expected...,"I was expecting a little more from this product. I couldn't find an eraser anywhere in stores and saw this one so thought of course it'd be great since it's Melissa and Doug. First off the wood part isn't very strong. My son's nails chipped it up from the first use. It seems to have a plastic cover over it. Also, it doesn't erase the greatest. There's still quite a bit of residue left from the chalk. The bottom gets beat up pretty quick. Overall though it isn't a bad product. It does the job it is meant for. Just a little disappointed in the quality."
2,Doesn't work that great for chalk.,I have a homemade chalk board and I am not too impressed with this eraser. It leaves behing a lot of residue... I am going to look for another eraser.
5,Just what I wanted,Just what I was expecting and needing for my whiteboard. I didn't realize that it was the same as the chalkboard eraser. It works for either surface.
5,Good Book - Better than MS offerings,"After making relatively successful forays into MFC armed only with MS reference materials or books written by MS employees and I have finally found a book which explains MFC without marketing it. Very lucid and well-written. I think the Document/View model is a bit less generic and useful than is presented, but at least now I understand most of its underpinnings. One error - Delphi has never been interpreted (p.5);"
4,Almost perfect...,"I was recommeded to buy this book by a MFC guru programmer. I was not disappointed. I have 3-4 other MFC books (1000 page +) - but they mainly focus on ""plug and chug"" techniques that explain what buttons to push to create the code. What they lack is an explanation of what MFC goes does when you push [F5] to run the program. It was ""left as an excercise for the reader"" to slog through thousands of lines of MFC code, use Spy++ and debug prints to figure it out! This book has nice explanations and nice graphical blocks of what MFC is doing (especially messaging, which can be daunting as messages are flying at you from God-only-knows where). The downside of this book is that some of the explanations leave you wanting a deeper explanation, and for that you get to go back to the aforemented slogging techniques! All-in-all this is a great book and a great value at the price I paid on Amazon."
4,Good product,This was a good product and reasonably priced. It was easy to use. I would definitely recommend this product to others.
2,A not impressive read,"I think my rewiew will be a little diferent from the others I have read here. In my opinion, ""The River Sorrow"" is a slow-pace story, without good characterization. That's the kind of book you forget as soon as you finished reading. A book to be really remarkable must stay in your mind long after you put it down. That's not the case of ""River Sorrow""!"
1,Simply Awful,"Craig Holden has done some very good writing in his career, but this book can't be included in that statement. I loved his book Four Corners of Night so I thought I'd give this one a try, but I put it down after slogging through the first 200 pages. The plot seemed mildly interesting, but the characters are so one-dimensional and shallow that I didn't care one bit about anything that happened to them. They were all boring, poorly-created cliches. The writing in this book was also terrible. Holden's prose in Four Corners of Night was some of the best I've seen in years, so he's obviously learned a lot about his craft, but this novel reads like a high school kid's attempt at writing a ""cool"" book. Don't waste your time on this one."
1,Disappointing,I've read some of Holden's other works and saw this one at the used bookstore so picked it up. I got through 220 pages and finally put it down and I never make that kind of commitment and then not finish the book. This one is simply unreadable. Holden certainly improved dramatically in future efforts but skip this one.
1,Nothing like anthropology,"Anthropology entails 3 perspectives: (1) cross-cultural, or looking at other cultures than our own, (2) holistic, or looking at all parts of culture in relation to each other, and (3) relativistic, or looking at each culture as its own standard of values and meaning. Notice there is no ""Christian perspective."" Anthropology is not about judging other cultures, and it is certainly not about changing them. This book should not be called ""Cultural Anthropology."" What it suggests is nothing like anthropology. It should be called something like ""Destroying Other Cultures with Your Culture"" or ""Destroying Anthropology by Misusing It."" No real anthropologist would read this book, other than to learn about the mind of the true believer."
1,Horrible misuse of anthropology,"This book is a horrible, almost criminal, misuse of anthropology. If the author understood anything about the discipline, he would know that it is about relativism and respect for differences, not about trying to use cultural concepts to invade and indoctrinate other societies. There is no way we can control how our tools are used, but to employ anthropological knowledge and methods to overthrow another culture's religion is a betrayal of anthropology and cultural genocide against that culture. This book disgusts me, like all missionization."
4,Bratz,"My daughter loves this doll! Parents should however watch their children very closely as they are playing with the items because it comes with real nail polish and makeup so it could stain clothing and household items. Overall, it is a great toy especially for girly girls."
4,"Starts slow, but ends well","While the initial chapters are hard going, with a little too much repetition (N.B. Editor), the chapters pick up the pace by midway and the book finishes very strong. Consequently I went from regretting the purchase to very happy that I selected this book and stuck with it.I think I will continue to value the considerable wisdom in this book. The author provides very comprehensive knowledge about organic and sustainable orchard growing with clear instructions and ideas. A strong editor could improve it even more by structuring it into a more textbook style (IMHO)."
3,Way to deep for me!!!,"I normally like a deeper understanding of what I am doing, but this book was way over the top. I don't feel the need to know the mating habits of the north American aphid(joke). I have a half dozen apple trees in my yard, and was hoping to grow them organically. I don't have hours a day to spend on my trees. But if I did, I think this book be perfect."
5,The Best!,"I wish there were a book like this on every fruitbearing tree. I would buy them all. Very in depth coverage on traditional chemical treatments for fruit tree problems. Even better, an extensive description of organic treatments and potential treatments that the grower can explore. Meant for the commercial grower, but I found it to be just the information I needed for my home garden. A heavy hitter."
3,A great resource,"I could not put the book down. It reads more like a conversation between friends than a step-by-step how to. The author is present several schools of thought on organic farming and encourages others to try different approaches. A goldmine of information, it is comprehensive in its treatment of the organic apple growing. I highly recommend it to any one interested in raising apple trees for fun or profit."
4,"A Heartfelt Story, but -","""Mostly Bob"" is the heartfelt story about how a mangy, anti-social, and neglected neighbor's dog adopted the author upon the death of his own dog - Bubba. First Bob just came over for a few minutes, then he began staying - without encouragement or food. Bob would go home at 6 P.M. for his dinner bowl, and return at 6:05. After awhile Bob began following the author (Tom), and lie down outside the door nearest Tom. Then Bob began enjoying petting.Finally, after 18 months Tom gave Bob a bath, began cuddling him, invited him into the house, and took him with in the car. Feeling embarrassed, Tom talked to Bob's owner about taking over full responsibility. ""Fine,"" was the answer.Clearly Tom loved Bob the dog, and greatly missed him. The story tugs at the reader's heart. But it only takes about 5 minutes to read - cover to cover - and for the life of me, I can't see the need to buy it. Just read ""Mostly Bob"" in the bookstore."
3,5 Stars for the letter - 1 Star for the BOOK,"I agree with the other post that this is not a book. I was expecting a longer story and some photos. Instead, it is one line per page (literally) and then 4 to 5 blank pages. It looks as if it has 150 pages but most are blank. I read this ""Book"" in 5 minutes from start to finish.That said, the email/letter touched me and I did enjoy it. However, what a waste of blank paper. If pictues of Bob were included and the story was written out not to have a line per page, I would have enjoyed it a whole lot more.Beware. If I had it to do over, I'd go to the bookstore, skim through it and bingo - you've read the book."
3,"Nice Dog, Nice Sentiment, but Not a Book","This ""book"" has about one line of text for every two pages. The entire text of Mostly Bob can fit on one sheet of notebook paper. As they say, never judge a book by the cover. I bought the book as a gift for my daughter, here on Amazon. I did not realize it was so short. She finished it in less than 5 minutes. If you want a really really short story about Bob, then buy this book. It's a sweet book about a sweet dog who made something of his life. If you want a real book you can sink your teeth into, with a real plot and real characters, read Lassie Come Home."
1,Very disapointed,This book was a big disappointment. I read it in 5 minutes and felt it was a waste of paper and money. I would advise people to go to the book store and pick it up and read it while in the store. It is not worth 10.00 let alone 12.95. I cannot understand why it has been on the best seller list so long. I have told everyone I run into about the book and they were dumbfounded. It could have be printed in a phamplet and saved a lot of treesSue Z of Marion Oh
1,Book? What Book?,This so called book is a waste of paper. I thought I ordered a book but instead I got 150 pretty much blank pages with a on liner here and there. Thats five minutes and $12.00 I will never get back.
5,couldn't put it down,"I was in a bookstore. I picked it up and turned to a random page thinking it was a thing of quotes. It turns out it was merely a letter spread out across the pages, but as soon as I started reading it, I couldn't stop.We didn't have a lot of time before the parking meter would run out, so I had to choose between putting it down and leaving it. Despite the fact that it was probably only a couple pages of text, I couldn't part with it.It was a really beautiful story. It was worth picking up to finish it. It's worth keeping around.Normally, I consider the length of a book when I compare it to the price, but in this case it was worth it. I would recommend you find it in a local bookstore and read it. I say it's 50/50 whether you take it with you or leave it behind when you're done, but I'm sure you'll love it."
2,Mostly Short,"Although the purpose of the book is heart rendering, and the story a very good one, it's only 60 pages or so long. With ""mostly"" only 1 sentance per page. You'll finish it in 5 minutes. Like I said, the concept was good, and the story was moving. I was just expecting a much longer read."
5,Mostly Amazing!,I read Mostly Bob and was touched by this story of unconditional love & the magic of heart connection. It is the perfect gift for any age. ( I bought copies for my 8 & 10 yr old neices as well as my parent's who are 74). Anyone who has ever loved will relate to this remarkable book and appreciate the message of finding tenderness is many places. Mostly Bob reminds me of the capacity I have to love & that the joy in memories last forever. I highly recommend this book.
3,Heartfelt feelings about loss of dog.,"The feelings expressed by the author are so heartfelt and to the point as he recalls how he acquired Bob, learned to love him, and then -- much too soon -- has to put him down. Having experience similar grief after losing our rescued Golden to cancer at the age of six, just three years after we got him, the book was particularly poignant. The rescued dog, by definition, has already had to endure too much suffering to deserve a subsequently shortened life. Words like, ""do not regret the loss, celebrate the life that was,"" or whatever do not begin to offer consolation. Nor do expressions, like ""fortunately you only had him for three years, or the loss would have hurt more."" The author makes it clear that however short a loving relationship, the loss is just as painful.I guess, however, I would have been just as happy reading his manuscript as a book of one sentence pages."
2,Buy It On Sale For Peace of Mind. Not For the Warranty or Guarantee,"I've bought 2 of these clubs in the last several years when they were on sale. I still don't understand how it stops someone from driving, but for $30 it gives me a little peace of mind. I would not pay more. The first one failed after 3 years. One day the lock mechanism just broke. The second one has worked fine for about 4 years now, cross my fingers.But the warranty and their ""guarantee"" are a joke.Their product warranty is only 90 days, that doesn't speak highly of the quality.Their ""guarantee"" is: if your car is stolen with the club attached within 12 months, they will pay your insurance deductible if you have a claim. But ONLY within 12 months of purchase. After 12 months, if your car is stolen they won't cover you.So if you can get one on sale or with a rebate, it's worth it for peace of mind. But if you can buy a better one for the same price, with a better warranty and insurance guarantee, I would get a different brand."
4,Great but has problems,"This is probably the best you could wish for. I felt my SUV was absolutely safe. I've used ""the Club"" for many years, until I lost my last on in a car fire.But if you get this one, as I did as a replacement, don't lose your keys. Winner does not offer replacements or even blanks so you could go somewhere else to have them made. If you lose your keys, you are SOL. I've lost two over a period of time. Since I have only one left, I am afraid to lock my wheel. So I won't lock it, until I get another one; one for which I can get replacement keys. Visit Winner's site, and go to the contact us section for verification."
1,Think people!,"This is stupid, it doesn't matter how damage proof this device is, it is only as strong as the steering wheel itself, which I'm sure anyone can hacksaw through in less than a minute. Just a tax on people who don't have half a brain."
2,Completely changed from the original version,"The spanish voices are different from the ones i remembered. Also, some scenes like the one of Pecos Bill smokimg are deleted"
5,"Wipeout Pure OST for everyday, everywhere.","I've loved the wipeout games since wipeout 64 for the nintendo 64.I've always liked the music, and the music in wipeout pure is no exception.Music in this soundtrack was well selected, I like some of it better than the rest, but I like it all.Favorite tracks are Hellion, SaxTrax, and Twister.These tracks are amazing in a quality sound system. Especially if you got a subwoofer. These can really make that sub go."
3,Product Resolution is not as expected,"Resolution was not as expected. When I received the product, I saw there was a bright red light spot on the LCD panel which would never go away. Also the clarity was not that great. One good thing about this monitor is TV reception was very good, but little on the dark sideI would look at other alternative. But the shipment was received as expected and refund process went smooth."
1,Where is V-Chip?,"Does this product apply under the FCC rules:As of January 1, 2000, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) required all new television sets 13 inches or larger to contain the V-chip technology. You can usually tell whether your television has a V-chip by looking at the packaging. If you no longer have the packaging, the V-chip option usually appears as part of the televisionÃ"
5,Might be the best all around HPP program,"Meditative Relaxation is a great all purpose mind helper. Perhaps because it is more fouced on a state of being rather than goals, outcomes, and doing. A still state of perceptive active awareness may a lost art that deserves renewal. M.R. will help you get there."
3,Sony VCT-1170 Video Tripod,"I purchased this for use with a HDR-HC1, while all the pros like the Bogens, I really liked the remote control - but for the very high price it had better be very good. Bottom line - I sent it back.While it is strudy and well built, it would try and ""center"" the camera verticaly and there did not seem to be any way to adjust this. Also, there was some (a little) backlash. It seems like this is about double the price of other brands, but the only one in that range with LANC.I don't think it isintended for a small camcorder, perhaps with more weight it would not move on its own. But fot that kind of $ it should be very very good. Not sure at this point what I am going to get, perhaps the cheaper one and be done with it or a ""real"" tripod (for less $) and try and find a remote control."
4,Could Have been a 5 Star,"Well Made light weight heavy duty, the only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because the zoom control is backwards."
5,"Bruce McKenzie ""Special Moments""","If you like jazzmusic, you will love this production!Finest smooth Jazz, that makes your day ""Special Moments""You will just love it..it's an inspiration...."
2,Pure junk,"Ok, I've seen it despite the poor reviews. I can't say I wasn't told. The only reason this gets two stars is it was a really bad train wreak of a movie as one five star review, on another site, said. DON""T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS."
2,Why am I watching this???,"Terrible ending to this apocalyptic sci-fi thriller. Andy Lau (in his umpteenth lead role) plays a scientist and head of a telecommunications MNC whose girlfriend (Michelle Reis) has just died, and then gets involved in an international cult that believes the end of the world is nigh. With a cop friend (Anthony Wong) he got tracked down by the Caucasian cult leader who wants to ordain him (?). At the end the director and writers probably run out of ideas, or funds, or both. Whatever good the film does in the first one hour is undone by the abysmal end. You'll be a saint not to throw things at your television set. Pretty boy Andy gets to decide the fate of the world? Gimme a break! Is this the end of the world or what?"
1,children cannot wipe it off,To wipe those crayons off you need so much force - kids cannot do it. There is no difference between these and regular crayons.
4,"arrived, had the required parts, seems to be working OK","Worked fine. The internal drive didnt exactly conform to what the Apple documentation told me to expect, with screws in places not in the Apple documentation. However, the fault may be more with Apple than Seagate. With a few educated guesses I was able to install this unit into my iMac G5. It is working just fine."
1,click of death in 9 months,"I bought two of these 160GB Seagate Barracuda drives and although they worked like a dream for 9 months, last night one of them began giving me the ""click of death"". Thankfully I had set them up to run as mirrored RAID (show up as one drive on the system, all data duplicated across both drives) or I would have lost all my data! I am stunned that the drive died so quickly. I would avoid at all cost."
1,What is the size,I wish there were dimensions for this. I would like something to neatly fill a space.
4,A Good Story,"At the Crossroads by Rachel Isadora is a made-up story. It is about kids waiting for their fathers to come home. They waited a long time. I think that this story is really cool and that other kids will like it. I liked the pictures a lot, except the one where the moon was orange."
5,"Comfort, style, and something a little different!","I had a pair of the white Ecco Receptor Phantoms last year and wore it out because it was immediately my favorite pair of sneakers after wearing once. These black ones look even better (for the winter at least) and are equally as comfortable. If you happen to walk a lot you'll really appreciate these as at the end of the day, your feet will still feel great."
5,Easy to understand,"This book is really easy to understand, and teaches us men what we should really know about taking care of our bodies.I recommend it highly."
1,Don't take this too seriously as haven't read it yet.,"I studied parts of this poem in english at school and enjoyed it. It has a particularly 'cursed' and heavy feel to it, more then many books, and I noticed a similar atmosphere in a movie version I watched.Beware of what you're getting into. Heavy going but beautifully written. I'm looking forward to getting this translation and digging below the surface to explore the whole thing."
2,"Well, it was good in seventh grade","i ordered Beowulf because i remembered it being hugely entertainting when my seventh grade history teacher read parts of it to us on rainy days.....Maybe there are two Beowulfs and Grendels in the fictional world because i found none of the suspense, colorful descriptions or fascinating characters that got me through those rainy days in history class. i didn't even finish the book; it has been one of the biggest literary let-downs ever."
4,Beowulf: A New Verse Translation (Bilingual Edition),The product was needed for school. Book was in great condition and great price. Shipping by US post office was like everything else in the government SLOW!
3,A valiant effort.,"By creating a most readable version of Beowulf, Seamus Heaney has done the world a great service. His brilliant ability to capture the essence of this tale while allowing the language to flow in a beautiful rhythm is a wonder. The problem is the original story is what it is. Beowulf's battles with Grendel, his mother, and the final struggle with the dragon are still stunning and even more so in this version, with Heaney's interpretation carrying the day. But the remainder of the tale with its Nordic infighting and endless gift giving is tedious no matter how it is approached. At least now the boredom is enlivened by some great poetry."
3,Beowulf,I bought this for my English 12 classes several years ago. We do not use the full epic so I did not use it. I gave it to another teacher who used it and said it was good.
3,Three stars for effort,"When I first came to this text I was full of trepidation. I was concerned that the Norton Anthology (which now uses this version of Beowulf) had replaced a fine scholarly translation with one by a ""name"" writer. Although I still prefer the old translation to this one, I feel Heaney deserves credit for a good, if not earth-shattering, translation. Truly written from the heart of a poet, this is a better translation than most. I recommend it to those already familiar to Beowulf. It is an interesting counterpoint to more traditional translations."
5,Great audio adventure,"This is the first audiobook that I've ever enjoyed. Seamus Heaney, reading from his own translation of Beowulf (an excellent read, by the way), evokes the past in such a way that, listening, I almost felt that I was in a meadhall listening to an Anglo-Saxon poet.Oddly, the CD features ""unabridged selections"" from the poem, which makes as much sense as calling it a ""complete abridgement."" This reading IS an abridgement--don't be fooled by the packaging--but it is still worth buying and listening to.By turns melancholy and exciting, this was a great way to spend two hours. Highly recommended."
3,Not a bad translation...,"This epic poem tells the story of a Geat warrior named Beowulf. Usually I hate books of this sort that I am forced to read for class, but this one was not so bad. The translation from Old English (written on the left side of every page) to modern English (written on the right) was done quite well, and the translator did a good job of keeping the essence and rhythm of the original poem intact. The story deals with three main battles in Beowulf's life: with the monster Grendel, Grendel's mother, and a dragon. However, you will probably come away having learned a lot about how life was like in the Dark Ages as well."
5,a read-aloud must,"i purchased this book to read aloud to my children, aged 5 and 7, because they love all things dragon! with much discussion they understood all of it, and loved it. i recommend it to all families who have a medieval penchant."
5,"Essential ""Roots"" Literature","Essential ""roots"" literature for anyone with a drop of Indo-European blood, and anyone with imagination. There are passages of soaring poetry, particularly in the first half. I was struck by the echos of Homer in the clash of shining war gear and the curve-prowed ships that fly like birds.Also fascinating is the conflict between the warrior's code, celebrating vengence as the highest goal, and the nominal Christianity of the period. Many things are still the same."
3,Beowulf...a reappraisal,"The first time I read Heaney's Beowulf, I was possibly too shocked by what I saw as the translator's hubris. His renaming of characters and abbreviated notes in the margins put me off. I was not impressed by what I saw as the dumbing down of one of the greatest epics. Yet time has given me some clarity and perspective.The great value I now see to Heaney's Beowulf is that it speaks to the audience of today. More than just a poem, Beowulf has really become a myth of sorts. Its tale of courage in the grimmest of circumstances is timeless--and in some ways extra-literary. It deserves the wide audience Heaney has given it.Many of the choices that I felt were quirks in Heaney's translation have actually grown on me. When appreciated for its dynamic inventiveness, Heaney's translation becomes a special thing. The side by side text is an extremely valuable bonus to the student of Old English.Mea Culpa...I was wrong. Forgive me Seamus. I give this Beowulf my heartfelt recommendation."
4,Definitely worth the price.,"This is really a very nicely done, accessible translation, perfect for not only scholars and students but those without much background in the area of pre-literate English culture. Very nicely translated too--not at all awkward or stilted as so many translations are!"
5,Heaneywulf!,"I love Beowulf and now that Heaney's translation of this great epic is out, I am overjoyed. Seamus Heaney is an extraordinary poet; he has unusual word choices and his Irish background is wonderful fodder for Old English. I have read other translations of Beowulf before but they are always a little flowery, stiff or dated. It is hard to translate the Old English guttural tones but Heaney uses consonants freely and you can almost hear Grendel's footsteps stalking the men in the mead hall! Thank you Mr heaney!"
3,Beowulf,"The heroic tale of the warrior Beowulf and his fights against three monters. A ""modern"" translation of the Old English poem, it was very easy to understand. The translation flowed smoothly for the most part, and was easy to follow and really get into the story. The only complaint I have, is that there were times the rhythm seemed a bit off and it pulled me out of the story.4/5"
5,The epic Beowulf,"My first introduction to Beowulf was nearly 11 years ago as a high school student. Now, after reading Seamus Heaney's recent transalation, I remember why I enjoyed this epic so much. I would wholeheartedly recommend this translation (and more generally Beowulf) to all ages."
4,Highly Audible,"The one thing that stopped me from rating ""Beowulf"" 5 stars is that I think its equivalent form to be audio. Seamus Heaney marvellously translated the old epic into modern English, but the real majesty of his work remains hidden as long as there is no audio-edition available - an edition that should be spoken by Heaney himself, whose superb feeling for the relationship between a near forgotten Northern myth and our modern (TV-induced, OK) fascination with plot is already hinted at in the book. ""Beowulf"" spoken by Heaney would surely help to make people ""hear"" that there is a difference between prose and poetry (even in our age of prose-poetry). And it would probably say: ""Shame on you for banning poetry from the mass-market of modern literature. So much more could be said by using words more seriously"""
3,Beowulf Beware,"I enjoyed listening to the CD audio version more than reading the translation. But BEWARE. The CD is advertised as UNABRIDGED. When you read the cover carefully, it says, UNABRIDGED SELECTIONS. There are passages omitted. That was the major disappointment, and one has to assume a deliberate attempt to mislead on the part of the publisher. Otherwise, why not call it what it is, ABRIDGED?"
1,Audio CD is ABRIDGED,"I'm posting this review as a warning to buyers that although Amazon is presently listing the audio CD as UNABRIDGED, it's actually marked ""Unabridged Selections"" by the publisher in what is obviously an exercise in marketing double talk.The audio CD version omits many lines and even some sizable chunks of the original work. The only word for that is ""Abridged"" and the publishers should be ashamed of themselves for calling it anything other than ""Abridged"".Amazon should update the listing accordingly. I'm giving the edition a 1 star rating simply to call attention to the deceitful packaging. I have no other complaint aside from that."
3,It was okay,It was smooth and easy to read. The style wasn't outstanding in either a good or bad way. I would have preferred a different translation. (reviewed by my fourteen-year-old son)
2,Don't be fooled...,"If you read this new translation of Beowulf sparks you to pick it up like I did, read this first. Beowulf is still confusing and still boring, no matter how good the translation is. Come on, IT'S BEOWULF!!! It'll take a lot more to make this exciting!"
2,Beowulf review,"I would not recommend Beowulf to anyone who is looking for an interesting book. The story line is too historic, and it is hard for people these days to find a way to connect with Beowulf, the main character. As someone who does not enjoy stories based around epic heroes, Beowulf was extremely boring for me. He kills this; he slaughters that; he defeats this; he overpowers that. The story is so predictable that it isn't even worth reading. Maybe older readers will like it better, but in my opinion, it should not be considered a ""classic."""
2,BORING,"You know that part in ""Annie Hall"" when Woodie Allen tells Diane Keaton to not take any classes that include ""Beowulf"" on the syllabus?Well, he's right. Beowulf, outstanding historic relic that it may be, is incredibly boring. Has anyone ever sat down and read Beowulf for fun? If so, that poor chap must either have given up on page 3, or must have strange literary appetites indeed. This is basically an old legend, which can be related faithfully to you in, oh, maybe a three page little tale, but instead is blown up into what seems to be an endless poem. All I can say it, avoid this like the plague!"
2,...,"If you only read one book this year that: lacks substance, doesnt require any real thinking, lacks adequate description, has a ridiculously overpowered and infinitely benevolent hero, is written in a boring fashion, and is a 6th century equivalent to The Power Rangers......... makes it this one!"
1,peeeeeeuw!,who's kidding who here? a simple translation attracting this much bravado? it's a joke - wake up! there's a very bad smell from this version and you all know it - don't waste your money or your time. get real and get to a library!
1,What a Waste of Time!,"I consider myself a literarily open minded person. But this book I found to be the ultimate cure for insomnia. The English used then is very different from today's. It's not that I didn't understand it, because I did. But this novel carries no real plot, the entire dialogue throughout is robotic and monotone, and the descriptions are either overly simplistic or too ""Hemmingway""...on and on and on....Yes I suppose some would argue that this novel carries much culture and tradition with it, but give me a break! Jazz up the translation a bit and use language that REAL people can understand!!!!! Or don't waste your time!!!! Unless you suffer from an extreme case of insomnia, suicidal depression, or sheer boredom, don't come anywhere near this book!"
1,Can't be said enough: The Kindle edition is worthless,"I'm not the first person to post this in the reviews, but the others were buried when I purchased the Kindle edition, so I didn't know until after I bought it that there is no Anglo-Saxon text. If you're looking to study the original, this is the wrong way to go.I would like to add that Amazon was very good about getting me my money back (The whole process took about 30 seconds). So I have no complaints there, I'm just adding this review in the hopes that this information will be more visible to anyone else who might make the same mistake."
3,not quite the idiom of the poem,"To be brief: I taught the opening verses of Beowulf in Anglo Saxon, offering the students (undergrads, senior level) 4 translations, including Heaney and E. T. Donaldson. The prose trans. of Donaldson, in both sound and sense, is far superior to that of Heaney, which is often too discursive, making logical, even ""talky"" sentences out of the stately, rigid AS half-lines. His vocabulary and idiom are often from left field, totally unrelated to the actual text of the poem. It reads fluidly and logically and should not be dismissed, but it is not the best version for those reading the poem for the first, dare I say only, time. The lesson here? E. Talbot Donaldson was nobody's fool. The scholar defeats the poet in the game of translation."
2,Better Translations Elsewhere,"I'll be brief. This is an awkward translation, brought about I believe because the translator tried to be more cryptic than necessary, more brutal than desirable, and more enigmatic than the story already is. For those wanting a more accessible, readable Beowulf, I heartily recommend Kevin Crossley-Holland's wonderful translation and introductory notes, published by Phoebe Phillips Editions (London). Crossley-Holland's book also has the advantages of being a well-crafted book, expansively bringing to life the poetry of a legend from the classics of the medieval world. Finally, while I cannot endorse Seamus Heaney's translation, at least his efforts revive an interest in this anonymous medieval work, which deserves much wider readership, and although not included among the ""great books of western civilization"" canon, seems indespensible to understanding that tradition."
1,Do Not Buy Kindle Edition,"I have the physical book edition of this wonderful work, and wanted to have it also with me on Kindle. However, without any indication at all, the Kindle edition is abridged. It is only the modern English translation and does NOT include the Anglo-Saxon text.Amazon nis selling you half a book on Kindle, not the entire book. This is very deceptive and one wonders how many other Kindle books have been butchered by Amazon."
2,Abridged,It's not that long of a poem but large chunks where left out in the reading. I would have liked to hear the old english as well. Seamus Heaney does a great translation and it's is pretty easy to read. I say skip the audio version and read the book.
2,What language was he translating from?,"I was really looking forward to listening to this, and found myself very disappointed. Anglo-Saxon is a language of concrete nouns, active verbs, things happening and things being shown. Instead we have Heaney using such extremely trite phrases as, ""Without further ado."" Can you see Beowulf doing something without further ado? Of course not; Beowulf just does. Then there was the use of the phrase, ""Desperate affair,"" to describe Beowulf's fight with Grendel. Desperate affair? This does not sound like the way to describe the process of tearing off a Neanderthaloid monster's arm with your bare hands.Heaney's reading voice is frankly not very impressive, and coupled with the translation, made for a disappointing experience."
2,A less than heroic translation,"I originally read Beowulf in an English class in 1975, and while I forget the name of the translator, I remember the magic of the language as much as the magic of the story. In the current translation, I found myself often bored and often impatient with what seemed to me to be Heaney's ostentatious and clumsy attempts to revive the sound of Anglo-Saxon poetry. It probably didn't help that he includes the original on facing pages, and while I don't know Anglo-Saxon, I at least know how to pronounce it, so the magic of the original sound was there for comparison. In any case, expecting a revival of the magic, instead I had to drag myself from page to page. Heaney is a fine poet in his own right, but in my opinion he doesn't have the sound of Beowulf right at all."
3,Beowulf and the audio journey,Perhaps I am fortunate to have missed the other translations that others say are not as good as this one. I grabbed the audio anticipating a great journey but found that my mind kept wandering elsewhere. I would suggest you try reading this one--also the last CD appeared to be all about Seamus Heaney which I was not interested in.
4,Masterpiece Rediscovered,"I hadn't read Beowulf since college, and while I remembered the epic to be a magnificent piece of art, I had forgotten (or maybe just discovered through Heaney's translation) how beautiful it really is. The translation is superbly written--the alliteration is exquisite. I enjoyed the foreword almost as much as the poem itself! For more fun, or if you're studying Old English, compare the translation (on the right) with the original (on the left)--Great read no matter what your gender or age!"
4,A trip back in time,"I'm no scholar of translations, but I thoroughly enjoyed this version of Beowulf. I had read Beowulf in high school and never got this kind of a thrill. After enjoying Heaney's ""North,"" I decided to take a second look at Beowulf and was rewarded. This epic tale takes the reader back in time to a period when Christianity was new and pagan religions still close in the memory. Treat yourself to this well told tale of the days of old!"
5,amazing!,"Seamus Heaney is regarded as the best translator of texts such as these. This one is nothing short of a masterpiece. The bilingual edition is very very nice and really helped me a lot! He kept the rhythm of the poem true to it's original version, the decasyllabilic meter. Over all, i really loved the book, the translation, and the tale of epic struggle. Every person well equipped with the armament of the English Language must read this book!"
1,soooo boring,This is possibly the worst book I have ever read. The book is so repetative. The same event is explained at least three times.
5,Something to read again.,"This 3182-line-long Anglo-Saxon poem tells the story of Beowulf, a mighty Geat hero warrior, who comes to the rescue of the Danish king, Hrothgar, when the latter's mead hall Heorot is attacked by the monster Grendel. Beowulf kills the beast bare-handed and gains great renown, and later sets off to slay Grendel's mother as well. After going back to Sweden and reigning for over fifty years, he'll die wresting with yet another creature, a dragon.The poem has a nice cadence, which pushes you forward, and Seamus Heaney's modern English translation is very enjoyable to read. I regret not having been able to concentrate on the poem all the time (I was sometimes distracted by personal concerns and my mind started wandering off), and I think this is something I'll definitely read again."
5,As wonderful as everyone says,"The numerous farvorable reviews of this book and its quick ""sold out"" status say it all. This was a wonderful read. If you enjoy it, you may also want to read ""Grendel"" by John Gardner - an existentialist telling of the Beowulf legend told from Grendel's point of view. It is quite amazing."
2,KINDLE EDITION: Not Complete! It isn't Bilingual!,"I do love this book, but please buy it in hardback or paperback. The kindle edition isn't complete. Its the abridged english translation. Depsite it saying it is the bilingual version, it isn't. The old english is mysteriously missing.... : ("
1,Shamefully Flawed,"Heaney's translation, while immensely popular, is inaccurate at crucial moments. He seems to simply make up his own translation, even when a literal reading would have been equally intelligible and poetic, while preserving the original sense of the poem. The shame in this is that Heaney's work is becoming the ""definitive edition,"" even in schools. There are obviously much better translations for scholars. For the casual reader, I suggest Liuzza's excellent work:Beowulf (Broadview Literary Texts) (Broadview Literary Texts Series)"
2,No Old Eglish Text!,"This Kindle edition only contains the modern English translation. Amazon eliminated the original Anglo-Saxon (Old English or Olde Englisc) text. It's a great translation, but a disappointment if you were hoping to be able to compare the old with the new."
2,not exactily unabridged,"If you are following along in the book, by Seamus Heaney, sometimes entire pages are cut out. Its not just the unimportant stuff either. It is still a good CD and translation but its not exactly what it says it is."
5,Transparent Translation,Finally a translation that doesn't distract! No hyphenations. Clear. The introduction is the best I have seen to the poem and poet.
3,This was so cool,"It was not the best, we had fun with this kit but it is cheaply made. I would not recommend it"
1,ancient toy,I didn't like the toy becuase it came incomplete. I had to throw it away because no one contact me back when I try to replace that toy.
2,Jeep Wrangler manual,"The book is ok for basic stuff, way to brief, caused by trying to cram too many different models into one issue.Parts of the manual miss complete steps and gloss over areas not on the specific vehicle they might of had at the time.As a starting point, the manual is ok, but I had to use the Internet to fill in the gaps.$10-20 is all it's worth."
3,Somewhat dissapointed!!,"Since I now personally the sound of this artist, I could not recognize the same quality in this cd. I love her regardless and her God given talent."
1,Not compatible with Sony TV,"The unit appears to work fine. However, the Remote Control is not compatible with my Sony KV-20FS12. I called JVC tech support and was told that they was no way to program/reprogram the remote beyond the A,B,C,D codes and non of those work with the Sony. There is nothing in the literature about this problem. Buyer Beware."
1,Customer Care doesn't care.,"I never had the opportunity to discover if this is a quality product - it failed the second time I used it. That could happen with anyone's product so I contacted JVC's local repair organization and took the machine to them on February 16th. Today is May 18th and I still have no repaired machine or replacement. I contacted JVC's ""Customer Care"" unit on numerous occasions with no results. Several times they said they would get back to me ""tomorrow"" and never returned the call. I still have hopes but you can be sure I will never purchase a JVC product again. I hope this doesn't happen to you."
3,Great until hardware failure,"I have owned this unit for about 7 months. All worked great until one day the unit could not read any dvd's. Had to take it in for repair. They replaced cable and logic board. Received unit back and still does not work. Took unit back in and they said they will now have to replace entire dvd drive - apparently JVC would not replace drive first time around, they wanted the repair shop to replace a part. They did say there would be a high probability that this would not work entirely. I have to pay labor on this warranty repair which was 70 dollars. Unit is in shop awaiting new drive from JVC.I am surprised by the DVD failure. I have not used the unit that much. I have recorded with it and it has worked great........"
1,BT Adaptor Still Required $25 Firmware Upgrade,"We bought this product to use with our Motorola Razr phone as they don't have a plug-in adaptor for the Dock-N-Talk. However, the bluetooth adaptor didn't work as our Dock-N-Talk is about a year or so old & we were told we had to get a $25 Firmware upgrade before we could use the BT. I feel the BT should have included the Firmware upgrade & not nick me for another $25. We are just using the plug-in adaptor for our old Motorola V260 phone my wife still uses. I'd hate to get the $25 firmware upgrade...they'd probably come out with another upgrade shortly after & want even more money."
5,Wow,"I have to admit it. I am a cheapskate. I wouldn't use my Swiffer very often because of the cost of the refills. Now I can dry or damp mop my kitchen floor any time, with no further cost. The microfiber cloth fits perfectly, picks up the dirt, and rinses out and dries quickly."
3,there is nothing special about these,"i read the review that stated that these are somehow specifically sized to fit the swiffer jet while keeping the actual solution jets/ejectors open... hmm, i noticed nothing of the sort - though one can indeed somehow fold the thing to expose them, the pad doesn't stay fixed and will ride down and get tangled, and it takes a bit more than usual amount of force to push it along (light workout actually). i freely admit that the first bit could be entirely caused by user error, but in that case it would be nice if there was at least a pic of exactly how it's supposed to be affixed.on a different note, these are three (3) microfiber cloths of the almost exact sort sold here and at an unmentionable wholesale retailer numbering in 36 per pack (listed as cleaning towels and auto cloths respectively) in very comparable price range, so in the interests for receiving more bang per buck (bigger size cloths but they can be cut in whatever config), give them a 'search.'"
1,Can't be used with Swiffer Wet Jet,"Unless there is something I am doing wrong, these WILL NOT work with Swiffer Wet Jet. I was very excited to try these only to get them and be very disappointed. I was hoping to use these on my Wet Jet but there is no way to attached the cloths to is. So I got a bucket and cleaned my floor by hand with the cloths and the kept rolling in on themselves and sticking to the floor. Would not recommend these at all!!!"
2,Not compatible with Evolution Mint,"I bought these for the Evolution Mint since it does not come with enough cleaning cloths. They fit, but it was a mistake. When dry, the cloths do not pick up much stuff. When wet, the Mint cannot push them around as they generate too much friction.So if you buy the Mint, don't buy these. If you are hand mopping they will probably work fine. They seem to be well made."
3,good on the dry Swiffer,"I was looking for pads for my Swiffer and Wet Jet. The regular pads are expensive end up as more landfill. These pads are good for use on the dry Swiffer as a dust mop and can be used to pick up small spills. It cannot be used with the Wet Jet Swiffer because the cloth covers the spray jets, plus it is not shaped to stay on the Wet Jet. so, three stars because it's good for half the uses I needed."
2,Could not get into this book,I started reading this book and I could not get into it. Typically I can not put a book down and when I have to do something I can not wait to get back to find out what is going to happen. This book did not keep my interest.
1,All dried up,"I was all excited to find this toner so inexpensively; but yet again, you get what you pay for. The toner never even print one page, I suppose it's all dried up. I ran the 'clean' option on the printer, at least 4 times, thinking maybe the head needed to be cleaned, but nothing ever came out. Very disappointed."
5,Wonderful recipes - beautiful pictures - interesting stories!,This book - though now out of print - contains some of the best recipes I have ever used. The pictures and stories are a wonderful treat. I recommend the book as a year-round coffee table companion.
2,No Holds Bared,"This book should be retitled ""No Holds Bared"". Granted that incarcerated men have little else to do but engage in every conceivable form of carnal daliance, but the extravegence of the sexual circus detailed herein stretches the bounds of credulity. To imply that men would deliberately seek prison to broaden their erotic horizons is not only an insult to self respecting gays seeking meaningful permanent relationships, but a slap in the face of a judicial system already reeling from the affronts of homosexual terrorists blowing up our buildings when they are not [bothering] each other."
4,Great family movie,I chose this movie as a family time movie. We watched it over and over again enjoyed the silly situations that these men got themselves into.
5,a classic,"A rip-roaring fairy tale told with great warmth and a lot of heart. Ray Bradbury's wonderful short story made into a wonderful film. Olmos' confrontation with ""El Toro"" is not to be missed and right up there with the best of Chaplin or Keaton. I haven't laughed so hard in years!"
1,The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit,I liked some of it. It wasn't edited that much because there was some stuff that didn't make sence at the end. Like the last person supposablied got ran over by a car but he didn't. When the one guy was trying to help him he was sweaty but after words he wasn't.
2,FUN FOR THE KIDS...POISON FOR THE ADULTS,"Beware all you ""musical"" haters, this one really bites. Gordon fans are truly in for a rough and torturous time. Take my advise: If your over 10 years old and your mind has matured along with your body, avoid this one at all costs."
3,Good clean fun,"If you're looking for good, clean comedy for the whole family, then here it is. It is so lacking now. Most comedy have a lot of bathroom, sexual or even violent humor. This has some but it is all so mild. No blood, no sex, one curse word.One of the true great ensemble pieces. It makes you want to see the other works the actors did. This is my first time seeing Joe Mantegna and Edward James Olmos in a comedic role and they were truly funny. Sid Caesar's cameo was funny in itself. It's cheap enough to buy, enjoyable enough to watch over again and clean enough for the whole family."
3,Good for the kids,"Might not be enough story to keep adults tuned in, kind of slow moving, lots of filler makes the story kind of fragmented. But it's got a good heart and some funny moments. Wish there had been as positive Latina portrayals as there were Latinos. Nice set design. Gregory Sierra is da bommmmmmb and should be given more roles!"
5,Pricing,"It seems like every pay day when I check this, the price goes up more and more. If it went back down to $36, I'd purchase it. I'm disappointed that I can't afford this DVD and I really want it. I just get discouraged whenever I come on here and see the price."
5,Laugh out loud funny.,A pure delight. Nice to see a sweet story about normal people with normal dreams set in the hispanic community. Hopefully this will get the exposure it deserves.
1,I couldn't finish it,"This is my first novel from Cherryh, and after trudging 2/3 of the way through Hammerfall, it will probably be my last. Boring, slow, flat characters, dumb dialogue, descriptions of boring stuff that doesn't matter, giant holes in a lame plot, etc....I paid $2.50 in the discount section at Waldenbooks and still feel like it was a bad deal. Borrow before buying."
2,Surprisingly disappointing,"I generally enjoy Cherryh's books, because they are tightly plotted and well-written, but Hammerfall was a disappointment. The plot reverberates with echoes of Dune and other desert-based SF -- down to the chapter-introducing passages of wisdom and the raging sandstorms. The nanotechnology twist is a good one, but it's never fully realized and the only character with any depth is Marak Trin Tain, the main character. The to-ing and fro-ing in the desert is repetitive and predictable. If I want classic Cherryh, I'll re-read Cyteen. If I want classic desert SF, I'll re-read Dune."
4,Solid entry from an industry veteran.,"I am a little curious why so many people seem to hate this book. I agree that it is not the best Cherryh, but even her so-so work is better than that of a number of other writers. I will admit that the endless backing-and-forthing across the desert got a little bit tedious, but I found it a compelling vision of life eking itself out in a hostile environment.This book was not a waste of time. You will not find me running to read the next, but I am sure that I will eventually read it."
2,A hard slog across the desert,"I was eager to like this book, which was my introduction to Cherryh's work. Instead I found myself bored, impatient for some movement in the story that didn't involve endless crossings of the oh, so dangerous desert. The scifi element of the plot finally kicks in but it's too late and too lame for this reader."
2,Twice as good at half the length.,"I couldn't believe it. They crossed the same desert 3 times and the author didn't even skip forward over the odd week or two. It was like reading about the solution of a ""Towers of Hanoi"" puzzle. The author put a lot of imagination and creativity into this story but needs a good editor."
3,Piqued my interest just enough to read,"This book was interesting, but somewhat predictable. If you don't mind having some mental telepathy involved in your book, then it was a good read. The story kept me reading, despite the lack of intense action."
4,none,One of Cherryh's best and innovative new world's to come along in a good many years. HAMMERFALL is fraught with intrigue and wonder; a compelling read that is sure to delight her fans and stun new ones... Gary S. Potter Author/Poet
2,Cherryh at her plodding best,"Cherryh's books are known for their brilliance, suspense and magic moments, all of which are lacking in this very well written plodding story that takes the hero there and back and there and back again... and nano technology has been written up for, oh, 20 years, with more terrifying consequences than this book explores. I was surprised at the lack of detail at the end of the book and had to read it twice to make sure I didn't actually just put the story down unfinished."
4,This is not a bad book,"From the reviews I'd read for this book I went in not expecting to find it very enjoyable, but I was pleasently surprized. This is not a bad book. It may not be on a level with Cherryh's best work, but it is a good read. Cherryh is know for her complex plots, and well drawn aliens, this book does not have either but it does not miss them. It is a simple straight forward story with a simple almost everyman hero. It pulls you into it's world and makes you care what happens next. It was a nice change of pace from the huge complex multi volume sagas that seem to be dominating the genera lately."
5,On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft,"Recently i've read some not-so-good books by Stephen King which kind of cooled down my enthusiasm about him.(See my review about ""Just After Sunset"" at Amazon.com)So naturally i didn't expect much from his book ""On Writing"" (which is not a fiction book but a semi-autobiography, semi-study book for the beginner writer).I feel really happy now. He made me trust him again. I can once more say that S.K. is one talented S.O.B.Even if you do not like this specific genre you still have to give it to him. He knows what he's doing and he's very very good at it.Stevie, in your book ""On Writing"" you wished for resonance. Well, you got it :)"
5,Change Is Good,"Stephen King has made a remarkable and substantial change with this book, and through the book he has proved that his writing abilities are not limited to his stereotypical horror/fiction genre. On Writing explores King's childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood as a writer. Not only does the book give background information, it provides tips on submitting manuscripts to magazines and the importance of finding an agent.The book also discusses how King's accident in 1999 affected his health and writing.King provides the reader with examples of prose and examples of how he edits prose to keep it concise yet informing. The book is a quick read and well worth your time if you aspire to become a [better] writer. King's genius is undisputable, but this book is testimony that his genius is not limited."
4,"First Part is Great, Second Part is So-So","The first part of the book is great. It's a free-wheeling largely chronological autobiography with some great insights. The end of that section seems a bit rushed -- like there was a deadline to meet. I wish it could have gone longer.The second part is more for the experienced writer, not the general public. Although I do like reading about writing (some of Tolkien's stuff is eye opening) but this got dry really fast.Overall, certainly worth trying out."
4,a 'must-read' for every aspiring writer...,"while i'm not currently a fiction writer or a constant reader of mr. king, this book is excellent! learning about his life and how he became the author he is today (back in '99)...fascinating. i appreciate his tone of encouragement and honesty for the aspiring writer, as well as the technical tips. i will certainly take away the lessons shared from this book and apply to my work. great read..."
5,Kicked my ****!,"I recently purchased this book since I'm finally getting back into writing. I was really searching for some inspiration on writing and this one kicked my ****!I couldn't put it down. Stephen King is in his truest form, blunt, funny and slightly warped (aren't we all?). I am definitely inspired and even sold some articles to a local magazine recently, now just to get to work on my novel.King truly hits it on the head when it comes to writing. Forget the workshops and endless group therapy discussions. There's no secret mecca of writer's ideas, but King certainly gives you all the tools you'll need. To be a writer you HAVE TO BE A READER and YOU HAVE TO WRITE. So, get back into reading with ""On Writing"" and get inspired."
5,Must Read for New Authors,"If you're a new author or aspiring author, this is a MUST READ. Why? Because Mr. King reveals the mindset that helped him developed awesome books like The Dead Zone, Carrie and The Green Mile. Before reading this book I assumed authors wrote books off plot outlines, but instead Stephen reveals that he dives right into a ""situation"" and then ""discovers"" that situation as he writes the story. Even he doesn't know what's going to happen at the end.Awesome. Five stars."
5,Amazing,A well written autobiography and interests and entertains AND a helpful guide to writing. A must read for ALL writers.
3,"Good autobiography, but not what I expected","It is an interesting autobiography of Stephen King. However, the title suggests that it is something else. I think this title was chosen on purpose to attract wannabe writers. A title should not be a hook to catch readers who might not be interested in reading the story of King's life.Although I found the book well written and amusing. I feel I have been taken for a ride, my fault perhaps, I should have read a few reviews."
5,Best Book on Writing I've Read,"There aren't really words to describe how fantastic this book is. People have been recommending it to me for ages, and now that I've finally devoured it, I know why! Not only is it an entertaining autobiography from a really interesting character, it's a master class in the craft of writing. I'll be digesting and using King's suggestions and guidelines for years!"
5,Great book for writers!,I use this book in my advanced writing class. Easy and fun to read with great quotes that I share with my class.
5,From a Writer and a Fan!,"Stephen King's new non-fiction book, On Writing, is the most concise, helpful, specific and entertaining book I have ever read towards actually becoming a published writer. He even gives you an opportunity to submit your writing to his website in the book! A must read for anyone who loves to write. Diane Klein, Author of IN THE NAME OF HELP"
3,"Educational, Disappointing","I wish I'd have read this Stephen King title before I wrote my first piece of published work. This book helped me to overcome writer's block, which was caused by excessive plotting, and motivated me to begin working an a new novel.The thing I found very disappointing was King's invitation for his readers to write six or seven pages about a scenario he outlined and email the work to him through his website. He said he wouldn't respond to everyone, but he'd read them all. I spent several hours doing so, and although it helped me as a writer, it bothered me to read his webmaster's response. Basically, King didn't expect anyone to respond and doesn't fulfill his promise of reading them."
5,Simply amazing,"I have never read a single Stephen King novel. I am not a writer (nor an aspiring one). I bought this book for my husband, but picked it up one night just to glance through it. I ended up reading the entire book. I laughed and cried through a book that was, I thought, going to be rather like a textbook. Mr. King even made me feel that I should write - just for the appreciation of it - just for myself. I now have utter respect for this incredible author. Anyone who speaks so lovingly of another human being (in this case his wife) and is as gifted in his craft as he is, demands our respect. This was such an inspiring book. Mr. King - I will being reading your novels now. I am ashamed I have not done so yet."
5,Not Crazy After All!,"Stephen King is the master of writing. This book is exceptional, clearly written and engaging. His personal ancedotes are hilarious; his direction invaluable. His words are delicious. All I could think while reading was ""hey, this guy isn't crazy after all""!"
3,A bit extreme--but interesting,"It is said to be good at something you study masters, a golfer would probably look to Tiger Woods.I guess for a writer Stephen King is a good person to study.The book begins with a brief autobiography, ending at approximately his kicking his drinking and drug habits. Interesting as background but little of it explains how it helped his writing.The second half is King's approach to writing; which seems a bit extreme(4-6 hours of writing/reading a day!), but his ideas on dialog, adverbs(avoid at all costs!), descriptions, plot and revising are on the mark.As an aspiring writer, I suggest you take Kings advice as suggestions as opposed to a plan."
3,If Stephen King Could Teach...,"This is the first book by Stephen King I have read and I have to admit I am disappointed.On Writing is written as two books: an autobiography and a writing primer. The autobiographical information was interesting and helped explain the latter. On the writing side, I came away felling I might have been better off if I had read The Elements of Style, King's favorite Style book.His sections on description, dialogue, narration and editing earned the book my three star rating. The examples cited and King's commentaries were great.I guess I expected more from such a prolific writer. The book's fault probably lies more in my expectations, than King's ability to communicate."
5,So good it's scary!,"Stephen King's take on the how-to-write genre may seem unusual at first glance, what with his turning it into half-memoir and half how-to, but his writing is so forceful and engaging it doesn't matter.All you aspiring writers really need to know is that, once he does get into the how-to-do-it parts, he does it with such finesse, such disarming honesty and good humour you'll be inspired no end and be very glad you bought this.You don't even have to be a King fan to enjoy this. I wasn't before I read this, and now I like King, and this book, very much. See for yourself!"
4,A writers how to book.,"I am not a writer, nor do I pretend to be one. However, aspirations to become a writer is an ambition we all have, at least those that appreciate good books. This Book, On Writing is a great resource from someone who has been quite successful at the craft. His thoughts on the subject are very candid, and amusing. I apreciate the time he has taken to put together such an exellent guide for those would be writers, and those who aspire to become writers, the nuts and bolts of writing. He fully illustrates what the writing life is like, and shows that it takes complete dedication to the art in order to accomplish such a task. Who am I to recomend such a book? a very delighted reader. A great read for a student of the written word."
4,Top Notch Read,Great read for any reader that enjoys learning about how to improve on writing and reading a non-fictional story at the same time. Fairly easy read. Recommend it to all Stephen King fans.
4,Shows that anyone can get published.,"I'm not really a big fan King's. I think when he really wants to he can create something magnificient (like Green Mile, Shawshank Redemption, or Hearts in Atlantis). But most of his story's I find ridiculous. His technical prose, however, is outstanding, which is why I picked this up. It's very inspiring to know that at the lowest point of his life is when he first published Carrie, his first novel. It makes me think that it's not impossible to finish a novel while working and going to school. Just focus and get into that writing zone. The law of inertia states that an object in motion tends to stay in motion. Get in motion and stay there."
5,An Incredible Visit with King!,"This book is terrific! If you're a fan of King's, you'll be fascinated by his stories of his life and its effect on his writing. If you are a writer, or want to be, BUY THIS BOOK. It's like taking a private class with a master writer. Incredible! I'm a published writer and felt like I learned many useful tricks and tools. This book made me want to go back and read all of King's books with a fresh eye for language and writing style. Highly recommended!"
4,What Every Budding Writer Should Carrie,"More than just a great read, ""On Writing"" is a conversation from one writer to a budding writer highlighting the glory and the realism of what it takes to get your work recogized and published. Stephen King is a wonderful mentor--pushing you to persevere and to take the discipline seriously. He gives examples and ""life lessons"" to motivate, inspire, and move you. No blood, guts, or ghouls in this book--but it IS filled with the ""spirit"" of the author and his passion for the written word."
4,Great Stuff,"I literally read this in a day. I don't know how anyone could write about writing in such an engrossing way, but Steven King has done it! The first part of the book is autobiography, serving to show that it's tough to break into the writing business, but it's possible. The second part of the book is dedicated to talking about writing itself, dealing with various pet peeves that King has and some things he's learned along the way.This book inspired me to write. That's a lot more than I can say for other books of this kind that I've read."
4,Literature Is News That Stays News,"I wish Stephen King would stop apologizing for his fiction. By specifying actual people as resembling characters in his books (Eric Harris, Dylan Klebold, Bryan Smith) he de-mythologizes his own fiction and it's universal applicability, reducing it to mere grubby current events."
3,OK.,"It was OK. Too many hard words. Info I didn't care about. Some parts were funny, though. Could've finished it faster if I didn't have to keep searching in the dictionary and online @ least 5 words per page! I'm not kidding."
4,Put this in your Writer's Toolbox...,"Really. It belongs in any writers toolbox. It isn't THE best book out there on writing, but in my opinion, it's one of the most honest. I've seen reviews from some who said that Mr. King came across as arrogant, smug, etc. I did not see this. Some people are unaware that Mr. King was nearly killed while writing this book, which is why it came out several years after he actually started it. Yes, I noticed a change in the writing, but after reading how bad the accident was, I understand. Near death experiences can affect us mentally, even if we don't notice it.One of my favorite parts of this book is where Mr. King tells us to: ""Write with the door closed. Rewrite with it open."" He is so right. I've seen it in my own writing. This is a book that belongs on every writer/author's bookshelf."
5,for those who hate to write,"I recommend this book not only to those reluctant writers, but for teachers for those students. I am a teacher and i found this very inspiring. I read part of it aloud to my students and they loved it. Some are even enjoying writing more. Thank you Mr. King!"
5,ON WRITING--TWO BOOKS IN ONE,"ON WRITING is a literary sandwich. The two slices of bread. one at the beginning and one at the end form an autobiography. I loved to hear Mr. King tell about how he grew up and how he worked as a school teacher. I loved to hear about how he loved his wife and how she loved him. I knew she would love im no matter whether he was able to walk again after his horrible wreck, and I knew he would love being loved by her. My husband and I listened to this part of the tapes, and we had to shed a few tears because we love each other that way. Then there's the meat of the sandwich. In a short time with no wasted words, he shared his pearls about becoming a great writer. Some day I too will be a great writer in my own style. One of the people I will thank will be Stephen King."
4,"regarding notes from reader in Boyds, MD","Incase anyone hasn't noticed this book is based on and around Stephen's life and how he acheived his status in the literary world. He states that it is very hard even for good writers to acheive any success. So when you say it is a waste of time, you are telling people that they should only base their writing on this book. This should not be the case. Many other books will help each individual and their writing style, including this one. This book is a guide to how you could write and to help bring your imagination forward. It is a teaching memoir, this is the way he writes. His use of experience prepares the reader for what may happen not what will happen.I definately recommend this book, novel, teaching guide whatever you may call it. I know for sure that it can help people maybe not you but it never hurts to see other points of view."
3,"The Horror! King's ""Writing"" Is Mostly Blah","Most of my enjoyment of Stephen King's ""On Writing"" came from reading the CV part of his memoir. As for instruction, ""On Writing"" is okay but having read William Zinsser's ""On Writing Well, 30th Anniversary Edition: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction"" before checking out King's book, I couldn't help but think that King found inspiration for the craft part of his book from Zinsser (starting with King's book title). If you want a more thorough understanding of the craft of writing I suggest you pick up a copy of Zinsser's ""On Writing Well."""
5,simply the best book ever written on the art of writing,Not only does this book clearly explain what makes a good writer- and what a writer must do to reach that point. (Read.Write.Read.Write repeat)It also is a window into the life of Stephen King. A must have for all aspiring writers- in any genre- and any King fanatic.
4,Surprising,"I am decidedly not a Stephen King fan but a writer nonetheless. I picked this book up as a whim and could not put it down for the following three days. Behind a cavalcade of horror literature lies a sensitive man who knows his craft. I found more helpful bits in the first section, his autobiography, than I have in any writing books of late. Even for those not enthralled with the horror genre, pick this book up. It's worth it."
5,King Gets It,"King gets it. He knows how to tell an autobiographical story. He knows how to tell how to write well. He knows what works and what does not.Most of all, King knows honesty. If you give a damn about how to write, read this book, then read it again.Also, anyone who appreciates John Prine's lyrics is a genius. King does.This book? Go for it."
5,insider's guide to writing,"Stephen King's ""On Writing"" is one of those rare gifts that seem to comealong at just the right time. I thought I might be the only one who has experienced the transition from, ""I wanna,"" to ""I haffto."" He lets us in on his mastery of the wriiten word along with many many meaningful moments in his own life. Very practical and powerful. Thank you Mr. King."
3,If you're looking for...,"...help with technique, look elsewhere. The advice King offers here is more intuitive and less instructive in terms of style. Good, but not what I was looking for."
4,A Good Book For New Writers,"I read this book just for fun. I am not a writer, but I have considered giving it a shot. King gives plenty of advice to the aspiring writer, pulling examples from his life and his experiences in the literary world. The author gives general advice and guidelines as well as specific point by point instruction. I have not put in the time that King recommends, but I imagine anyone who followed the advice in this book would be able to write something at least marginally decent. It was a good read, notwithstanding."
5,The Best,Simply the best guide to writing that I have ever read. It humanizes the whole process.Arthur
5,Right on target,"This is a remarkable book! It is one of the best I've ever read on writing. I have always been burdened by plot development, believing I needed to ""plot"" the entire story before I started to write. I felt liberated when I read Mr. King's ""What if?"" approach to storytelling. By using this approach, the story evolves on its own. Thanks for writing a great book."
4,"Two, two, two books in one","Stephen King probably should have called this book ""On Life and on Writing."" That's because this book is part autobiography (a rather sketchy autobiography) and part writing course. The book never fails to be interesting, thus the four stars, but I think the reading/writing public could have been better served by two separate books, with a fuller treatment of both King's life and his tips on writing. What he has to say about writing is very helpful, and one cannot argue with his success. While it is probably not the final word on the craft of writing, it is a very good start."
3,"Funny in the beginning,preachy in middle and boring last","King was at his funniest in the beginning when he mentioned yarking as he put it when he ate too many fried eggs as a kid I did feel extremely angry that he was one of those kids that tormented kids like Sandra and others that resembled Carrie White I can understand her and pity her,but I don't find her unlikable. Shame on you Steve. As for his addictions to alchol and drugs,I don't see how his wife put up with him for so long. I would have kicked this lazy,overbearing control freak out on his butt the first thing. Woman must be a saint to put up with that crap."
3,On writing,"I read the first few pages, but lost interest. I'm sure if I concentrated better I would get some great ideas on writing technique."
4,The Craft of a Writer,I bought On Writing: 10th Anniversary Edition: A Memoir of the Craft in preparation of writing my second book. I found some insights that will hel me as I craft the stoy of a business book. Thanks Stephen for reveling your process and keeping it real.
4,A lovely gift from one writer to others,"Books on the craft of writing and memoirs are alike in being prone to self-indulgence and wankery, as some writer tries to justify his career and/or life. Stephen King, who has always to my taste been better at non-fiction than at fiction, avoids the pitfalls laid by pretension at the feet of the reflective. Only in the last section did I find any trace of self-centeredness, and considering the subject matter there is the car accident that nearly killed the author not very long ago, some lapses are certainly understandable!King's recounting of his life and career are fascinating and vividly told, and for the most part his advice on writing is laid out in the form of 'this is what is right for me' rather than 'this is THE right way'. Where he does dogmatize, he falters. But he falters very rarely for a writer that many people would condemn as a hack."
5,Put Down That Pen! Read This Before You Write Another Word!,This is the one! The one book about writing that you should read. If you are a writer it is invaluable. If you are a reader it is a mind opening experience to see into the talented Mr. King's mind. The only book I've ever read about writing that I think is PERFECT. Do yourself a favor and buy this book!
4,A fine insight,"An interesting insight in how Stephen King prefers his fiction. Not everyone will agree, but it's interesting how he hates the passive verbs :-)"
5,A Light In The Dark,"Whatever genre it is you're writing this book is very helpful. King is wonderfully concise and clear with his rules and philosophies on writing, but we also get a glimpse of his own processes and the details of how his body of work played out.For fans it's a good time. His personality, his voice as the writer we know so well, takes us through his own house this time, his morning, his Maine, his muse.He helped me better understand some of the rules put forth in Strunk & White's 'Elements of Style' but as usual he was so much more accessible, which is his genius (and should be the goal of any writer)."
5,Jyl Scislow-Author of Moral Hazard-A Wall Street Thriller,"""This book inspired me to pursue my dream of writing. It's pointed and truthful and its discourse uniquely the voice of Stephen King.Moral Hazard - A Wall Street Thriller"
4,great read!,"I really enjoyed this book. I thought that it was informative, funny and interesting. More memoir than writing book, but the writing tips are to the point and don't waste any space! I especially like that the author invites you to submit a writing sample in a format he directs."
4,Yes please!,"As I read this book, i could almost see Stephen King sitting there, mumbling too himself. This book is the voice of a man, talking about his experiences as a developing writer. He offers many tips and valuable advice, and all in a lightfashioned manner that is simply delighting to read. This is not a boring learn-how-write book. This is a journey in the life of an author, and a story in itself."
5,a master takes the student in hand and shows them around...,"I am a huge fan of Stephen King. Have been since I was about thirteen or so. I have eagerly awaited each new novel. And for the most part have not been disappointed.When I heard that King was writing about writing I couldn't wait to read it. I finally got my hands on a copy and let me tell you, it certainly met my hopes and expectations. This book is written in very no nonsense tone. King lets you in to his world and explains how/why he does things with his writing. He does not come across as being a know-it-all author with a few sticks to grind. Nor does he come across as boorish old English teacher. Instead he comes across as a friendly helper.If you are a writer who is trying to find a voice, read the book. If you are a writer who has found a voice and wants to make that voice even stronger, read the book. If you are just a King fan and want to know more about the guy, read the book.Great book, fun book. Enjoyed it."
4,"Fun, not functional","This quirky memoir is as much fun as a Saturday matinee with a double feature from American International Pictures on the bill ...However, it is autobiography much more than instruction. That's not a criticism, just a friendly warning to people who might think ""On Writing"" is a how-to book. There are plenty of those out there (maybe too many). There's only one Stephen King and as the (very) old song says, ""he's an education in himself."""
2,Inspirational and enjoyable but doesn't teach you much,"It was a pleasure to read this book. It gave me some inspiration and more will to write. If this book was prose, I'd definately give it full 5 stars, but the fact is that this book doens't teach you almost anything about writing. Yes, it tells you to write each and every day, preferably at the same time and at least some specified amount of words, but who wouldn't figure it all out himself? Besides, the book tells in fact mostly about Stephen King himself; his past and stuff like that. What does it have to do with writing? If you're a fan of King and interested in writing, this book is for you. Otherwise, it's not worth the money. There are better books out there, just go and find them."
3,Why?,"I have never read any of King's works, before attempting this one.I was drawn to this, because simply he is a very successful and prolific writer. And I was interested in finding out what made him tick, so to speak.Well, I found this book was very poorly written. The expression lapsed in places, which I thought was due to laziness. Therefore, given the subject matter, the disparity was very annoying.The book left me very uninterested in attempting his other works.His general commentary on writing was useful. But I think he could have summarised it in a few words - that is, write 'simply, not flowery'."
2,Two,"With the hype surrounding this book, I decided to pick it up to see what that was all about. I was told it was a 'must' read.I skimmed through the life sections about King. I don't think he had led a overly exciting life like he sees to think. So that left me with the writing sections.First off, King's advice is his own. It is what works for him. I am a fan but I was saddened to see how he named a couple of books throughout the memoir, mostly by dead authors and bashed them because they didn't write in his style. And when be mentioned backstory I couldn't help but snicker how this man often(very often), writes pages of it throughout his novels.Again, I am a fan but after reading this I cannot help but see him in another light and it isn't good."
2,Meh.,"I was hoping the book would be a guide on how to be a good writer. While I'm encouraged by the biographical portions of the book (even he has a stack of rejection letters), I found his advice on writing to be somewhat stilted.For instance, he discourages people from making notes on their ideas - well, what if someone has ADD or is really, really busy? I tend to be forgetful of some pretty important things and keep a frantic schedule, so I rely heavily on notes, not just on writing ideas, but to keep the day organized. Plenty of other writers have plotted their ideas with good results (J.K. Rowling, for instance, whose writing Mr. King respects).I'm not going to go into a huge, detailed rant on every little thing I found wrong, especially since another person may find this to be a valuable resource. Maybe his advice works for him and a lot of other people, but it wouldn't work for everyone. I'd say enjoy the book, but don't make it your bible."
5,Unexpected,"I'm not a Stephen King fan, because I can't read his books (too scary!). This, however, is not a horror tale, but bits of memoirs wrapped around writing lessons. A good book for any writer to have."
4,Read and learn,"I was skeptical at first as to how good this one would be. I really, truly enjoyed it! This is the book Stephen was writing when he was hit by the van. He has been very generous with advice and, as always, that King charm. A very good book if you want to see into the mind of a master."
5,He's brilliant and sweet,"He's a recovering alcoholic with a sort of oddball childhood and a (single) mother who loved him and his brother fiercely, and was a writer because he was a reader, as far back as he can remember. He's brilliantly smart. He writes to make sense of his world (and a strange and scary world it is, sometimes) and because he likes stories. As a writer, this book punched me in the gut and made me teary-eyed a few times because -- reading it, I simply felt like Steve King ""gets me."" When he and his wife and baby are living hand-to-mouth and he gets paid six figures for ""Carrie,"" if you don't get thrilled for him...you should get your heart checked out."
5,Rich In Perspective,"By reading Stephen King's 'On Writing' I expected a few good points about the craft from a favorite author. I received a very rich perspective about writing and life. King peels off his skin to reveal an imperfect past with neither shame or rationalization. He places each memory into a puzzle board revealing a wonderful picture his life and how his experiences affected his stories. This is especially true after his horrific accident a few years ago. Between autobiographical bookends to ""On Writing' King provides pointers about the craft. Rather than dealing with the subject in grass blade detail, he broadens the readers viewpoint about key tools and important objectives before putting pen to paper. It is a lively discussion intended to broaden a writers perspective without constraining their creativity. Obviously, I enjoyed the book, picked up some excellent ideas about writing, but most importantly, received a lesson about how loving life is the foundation to good writing."
3,Inspiring read for the aspiring writer,"On writing is a version of Steven King himself as a child. He talks about his mother and her jobs, plus most of the places he lived as a child. He is a fowl-mouthed writher who gets right to the point. Although, reading this book might inspire you into writing a novel, don't think it is going to happed in one day. He describes a toolbox as useful elements in the writing process. King also describes other writers in their ways of writing, such as H.P. Lovecraft, James Joyce, Harper Lee, and John Grisman to name a few.Writing is a true dedication in order to write a story you must have your mind set."
5,Great for any writer,"Stephen King is so easy-going and honest in his assessment of how writing works. I blew through this, nodding my head after every page."
3,One for King fans and would-be writers,"As an avid King reader, I had to read this book, whether or not I was interested in how to write well (and I am - though you can't tell from this sentence!). The book is part memoir, part random 'on writing' gems. Actually, 'random' probably best describes the format and content of On Writing. Admittedly, King was attempting to avoid a detailed 'do this, do that, this is the way it must be done' summary - I'm glad he did. His points on writing were easy to remember (mostly because they were repeated several times) and easy for anybody to put into practice. Read alot and write alot, says King - sound advice. My gripe with this book, although small, was that his editor allowed too many repetitions of the same information, mostly in the writing tips and also his near fatal accident. It made the book seem less polished."
5,You could almost take it personal.,"It was fascinating to read a book about writing written without the flat and boring qualities of an ordinary English grammar and literature text. But, could Stephen King ever write like that? Probably not... The book is loaded with the usual King quips and idioms. It's easy to read and often humorous. King explains how interesting writing can be, just as long as you are enjoying it and having fun doing it. His opinions on editing and rewriting were excellent. He seemed to be pushing or edging the writer on as he spoke. His little pat on the back, letting you in on his realization of the amateur writer's loneliness and insecurities, was priceless 'felt from the heart' information. I'm not sure if I'm ready to see the guy that appears next to me smoking his cigar and putting ideas in my head. Although, since reading this book, I'm pretty sure he's there; I just can't see him yet."
2,boring.,"I found this book to be dull, boring, and a slow read. The first part was a little interesting; about his childhood. Then it turned into a ""how to"" write like him. Not my favorite book AT ALL."
2,"Too Flabby, Too Tabby","This isn't the worst book on writing that I've read,but it's not even close to the best (which is JohnGardner's ""The Art of Fiction."") The problems startwith the title, ""A Memoir of The Craft."" The memoirsection will be of interest only to King fans and ofno interest to anyone else. There is far too muchcontent devoted to Tabby (Mrs. King) and to pointlessdetails that have no bearing on anything, e.g. ""we weretraveling to a WNBA game between Cleveland and...""[whocares!!]and are quite typical of King's blow-hard stylehere and elsewhere. The writing suggestions are okaybut not new and not particularly insightful. King citesan editor who called an early story of his ""too puffy.""That's a bulls-eye review of this book as well: toomuch puff, not enough stuff. (He also mentions TWICEthat he ended his relationship with Viking because ofstupid argument about money. The same point repeatedin IDENTICAL language. I'm looking at you Mr. or Ms.Editor!"
5,Inspirational,"I enjoyed the book, especially the sections after CV. King rambles in CV. Although I found his life story fascinating, I was reading this book to learn his tricks of the trade! Shorten CV by 10% and the book will be 10.I am glad that I read the book. I respect King for his openess about his methods of writing and about his ups and downs in his life. He doesn't try to paint himself as a saint or diety among writers. He's just a man who is passionate about writing (and reading). In the back there's quite a bibliography of suggested reading (all fiction, I think)."
5,My favorite book of all time,"I love Stephen King's scary novels and have read all of them, but this non-fiction book describing how he writes those novels is the best thing he has ever written. Reading ""On Writing"" gives you insight into his personality, as he talks about his supportive wife, and the triumphs and tragedies he has lived through. This insider information makes you appreciate his novels even more. Also if you are an aspiring writer, Mr King gives useful advice on the process of writing and what it's like to get published from his personal experience. Part autobiography, and part ""how to write"" book, anyone who loves Stephen King will appreciate him even more after reading this book. Luckily it is now available in paperback for a low price. Buy one for everyone on your list who likes Stephen King, and/or wants to be a writer. (I am a full time professional non-fiction writer/reporter who loves Stephen King, loved this book, and learned from it)"
4,Surprisingly good,"Had I not been given this book as a gift, I would never have read it. And I would have missed out. For some reason, despite that he's sold more books than anyone, I always considered King a horror writer, never a writer writer. But the advice he gives is great advice. Not intending to write a comprehensive book about the tricks of the trade, he gives his highlights. The biggest things to focus on in writing. And he gives examples from his own work, how he learned the lesson. I learned more from On Writing than many of the writing workshops I've taken. More importantly, it gave me the shot of motivation I need from time to time. King's views get a little preachy at times, a little grumpy-old-man-ish (like when he says to stop wasting time watching TV), but I appreciate it. He, if anyone, has a right to say what he thinks."
5,Great,I am normally not a fan of Stephen King. This book was REALLY helpful though. It teaches in a very natural way. It forces you to want to write...not plan on writing like other books on writing.
4,Not just for King fans,"I found this book very encouraging at a time when I was just getting serious about writing. A lot of good advice, especially the self-editing chapter. The parts about getting published and finding an agent seemed dated to me, though; things were different when King was starting out over 30 years ago."
3,Interesting book,"Don't buy this book if you're offended by coarse language (but then, you wouldn't read anything by Stephen King if you are offended by coarse language).... The biographical information in the first part of the book is interesting, and there is a wealth of good information about writing techniques in the latter part of the book. Overall, a good read."
3,Does it really contain anything new?,"I enjoyed this book on writing by Stephen King--it was inspirational and freeing in many ways. I liked his discussion about plot, and how he doesn't make a slave of himself to it. But the book didn't contain anything new about writing, and actually contained less information than in other writing books I've read. It seems that he writes mostly by intuition, which is hard to communicate to someone else. Also, the profanity in the book was distracting and unnecessary. Perhaps he feels that in this point in his career, he can say what he wants, any way he wants. I would recommend reading this if you need a ""You can do it!"" jumpstart for your writing, but I'd get it from the library instead of keeping it on your shelf for reference."
5,King an Excellent Teacher,"I've just finished reeading Stephen King's On Writing. What an amazing book. Not only is this a memoir of King's life but a complete, though brief, guide to the whole novel writing process. King discusses character and plot, paragraph development, and basic grammer (to name a few). He gives advice on extra help, (The Elments of style, Strunk & White), and even sample writing to correct, which can be submitted on his website. It's an exciting, interesting, and quick read, (I finished in three days). You hear King's voice throughout the whole novel as if he were teaching a creative writing class. Not only will Stephen King fans love this book, but aspiring novelists, and writers alike. I reccomend tis book to any fan of reading or writing."
5,Knowledge from a Master,"Whenever a newly released copy of Stephen King's latest work finds itself in my hands, I feel like I am visting an old friend. Every tale brings new characters and new places (most of them small towns in Maine) but regardless of content, it is always vintage King. On Writting is no different. Half revealing self reflection and half instruction manual for the aspiring writer, this book sparkles through and through. King's ability to tell a story roars to life as he recounts memorys one after another, from childhood adventures and loves that would shape the man the world knows today, to his shockingly candid look at his adult alcohol and drug abuse. His text book on writing (no pun intended) is the most fun you will ever have learning and would be a great help and inspriation to any one with a yern to tell a story on paper. Once again, Stephen King has made me hateful to turn that last page. Visit again sometime soon, Steve. I love the company!"
3,Constant reader left wanting,"After finishing this book, I wasn't quite sure how I felt about it.It is seperated into three parts. The first are some brief snapshots of the author's life. Telling memories from his childhood, early jobs, first book publication, and even descent into addiction. The second part is strictly about writing. These are the pages that I found had trouble keeping my attention. The third section talks about his accident. He was hit by a motorist while walking on the shoulder of the road. He describes his experience in suprising detail.When he shines a light on his own work, giving us an inside perspective on the books we've already, it is extremely interesting. When he is talking about the use of adverbs, not so much.I understand that this is a book about writing. Myself not being a writer I wasn't fully able to enjoy it in its entirety. This book isn't off limits to you if you are, like myself, simply a constant reader. However, you should temper your expectations."
5,An True Inspiration,"I am a new writer, learning the craft. I am deeply moved by his honesty, love and sincerity for writing. He has given himself, completely to the creative process, and the public. I love the parts about how his stories came to life; how his role as an artist is to present, not to shape; and all the simple and down to earth rules on writing. This is my first review on line, because the book has given a great deal to me, and I must say something good in return. Thank you."
5,Great Background and Lessons,"I really love this book. It describes his life, childhood, and gives the reader insight on what he feels is the best way to go about writing. Wonderful in every aspect. Highly recommended if you are a Stephen King fan and interested in being a writer to some degree."
4,memoir with writing tips,"I have only read one King book (Misery), but another memorist/writer whose book I enjoyed recommended thisin her end pages, so I bought and enjoyed it. The writing tips are for would-be writers at the most elementarystage, and if that is you, you'll find every bit of the book useful and enjoyable. If not, there is a lifestory here that --to me--was worth the price of the book."
5,Reviewed by WritersWeekly.com,"From 05/16/01 issue of WritersWeekly.com: Stephen King's On Writing is out in paperback, so I picked up a copy. After reading the last paragraph of page 20 out loud to Ali and Zach (ages 10 and 14), they started arguing over who gets to read the book next. I couldn't read it to Frank (age 8) because I didn't want to give him any ideas. The first part of the book is gut-tickling entertainment and the last part is Stephen's own hints on how to be a writer...a GOOD writer. I'm thoroughly enjoying it and I highly recommend you pick up a copy. It's worth every penny. I think if he'd not been a horror author, he'd have been a comedian. -Angela Adair-Hoy, WritersWeekly.com"
4,"For the writer, yes...but for the reader?","I really liked this book, since I've been writing science fiction and horror for the last ten years and Stephen King is my favorite horror writer. It didn't blow me away with any writing tips, however. The autobiography portion of the book, I felt, was much better, only because it featired some anecdotes on how he got some of his ideas as well as his early days as a writer.So, from a writer's standpoint, I can see why this book is popular, but from the casual reader's standpoint, I'm puzzled. Over 200 reviews here on Amazon and I'd be willing to bet 175 were from readers, not writers. That statistic, if it's true (and like I said, I'd be willing to bet it is), says a lot about King. He can write a book that is basically writing tips and sell it to READERS! Anyone else would have been laughed at by his publisher. King is like no other writer on planet Earth."
3,Encouraging,"I finally picked this up because it's one of those ""must-reads"" on every author's list. I'm not a big follower of King's, although I've enjoyed and been impressed with what I have (namely, The Green Mile). What's here would no doubt appeal more deeply to avid King fans, simply because so much of it is commentary on his own life and writing journey. But it was an interesting read for someone like me as well. I probably enjoyed his memoir sections at front and back most. The actual ""on writing"" portion is full of good horse sense from the mouth of obvious experience. But little of it struck a new chord with me. The memoir sections, however, were a fascinating glimpse into the life and process of a prolific author. King's open, honest, and chatty style is a joy to read (although those who cringe at the occasional naughty word had best steer clear), and, in the end, what he offers is a manifesto of liberation and encouragement to writers of every stripe and skill level."
4,Stephen King on Writing,"The book came to me in record time, Bravo to the shippers. Generally Mr. King's work speaks for itself and his book on writing present a winners approach to the craft of writing. I found the read informative, the author never missing a bit and always making his point crystal clear. As an emerging author I now have key points to emulate. My interest in putting strings of words together has been well served."
5,Excellent,"King shows you the secrets of storytelling in the first section, which is memoir. In the second, he pulls back the curtain and gives opinionated advice on the tools of storytelling and their uses."
4,Fascinating insight into a popular author!,"ON WRITING reveals what every Stephen King fan wants to know--where he grew up, when he began writing, why his writing is so effective, and how he survived a nearly fatal vanaccident to resume his writing career. The brief autobiography is wonderful, but theinstruction on the craft of writing is outstanding. That section can stand alone as beingextremely helpful for an aspiring writer. Blending his unique style of humor and language,he explains how techniques such as honesty, action rather than adverbs, and believabledialogue contribute to good fiction. The English teacher in the author shines through! Sometimes surprising, but thoroughly readable, memorable, and instructive, ON WRITING is a small book but a large delight."
3,HE SHOULD KEEP TO HIS GENRE,"What can I say? Not King's sort of book, but then again, he's all over the place: can't contain him, can you? Some of his ideas and suggestions are interesting, but all in all, I prefer him when he stays within the boundaries of his B-novel nightmarish stories."
1,Why,If you want to be brow beaten this is the book for you. It is one thing to say you will never be a good writer in person but why take negative feed back just because of a name. It is like take a course in Spanish from a CD ROM. You never receive feedback as to why you are makeing the mistake.
1,A Waste of Paper,"This was definitely the least informative book on writing I have ever read. I picked up a grand total of one tip, and that was so ordinary that I didn't bother writing it down when I gave the book away to a charity shop."
1,Blah blah blah blah blah,"Just goes on and on about his childhood.The guy's got a lot of nerve selling us a book designed to make us better writers, and then writing on and on about his childhood.The stories are ""wonder years""'ish except not as exciting.Just blah blah blahI've only finished half of it but so far it's been utter torture."
3,On Writing half good,"Stephen King can write, no question about that. This is two books. The first one is a recounting of his early childhood and young adult stuggles. Interesting if that's what you bought the book to learn. The second book is on wrtiting. I bought the book for this subject - how to write well. It's very good. Lots of Stephen's opinion some may not agree with, but he is a very successful writer and it is worth learning what he thinks about the subject. Mostly he is right on. I underlined much of the second half of the book, not the first half. A table of contents would have seaved me hours of wondering when I would get to the good part. The book is worth buying and reading - the second half."
5,Two in one!,"Being a Stephen King fan, I had to buy this book. It was well worth it. The first part, an autobiography, is worth the price of the book itself. If you have read Kind, you'll love it! It's funny, interesting, revealing - you'll understand much more about his work afterwards. The second part, which is actually ""on wrting"" I found very interesting as well. I'm not aspiring to become an author, but still I read it all and never got bored. If you like Stephen King's novels, buy this one. If you're looking for a book on writing, you'll find a lot of helpful tips, but don't expect anything too technical."
3,Good not profound,"I am happy I read this, I guess that sums it up nicely. The beginning was a bit too much of his personal story for me. I wanted to get right down to the ""on writing"" part. However he's Stephen King so it had me interested and at times laughing. Worth the read for an aspiring author."
2,Poor quality,"I ordered two packages and was so disappointed in the quality of these washcloths, especially considering the amount of money I spent. First off the seams on half of the washcloths were not sewn together correctly. They were just folded over and sewn, so that one edge of the washcloth isn't straight at all. (The other half of the washcloths were sewn together just fine.) Plus, the first time I washed them (normal cycle with other towels), one of the washcloth's seams completely tore off.I would have given it one star, but to be honest. . . they are very soft and thick and I really like them - except for the fact that the seams are all messed up."
5,Love them,"Super soft and fluffy, even after many washes. I love that they are organic too. I bought the 6-pack and did not experience any problems with the quality of any of them."
1,Looks good but is junk. Get a $20 model instead,"I got this to go with my 3 other Pro Line appliances. From the get go it was clear that the heating elements glow unevenly and when a thin slice of toast used on the highest setting barely toasts, you have to wonder what all the lower settings are for. Honestly, the toaster I threw out where fully half the heating elements didn't work did a much better job toasting by flipping the toast and letting both sides toast. But hey, it looks good. KitchenAid also does not stand by their Pro line products. Don't Pros use things all day every day in professional settings? Well if they do it with Pro Line products they aren't going to be in business very long. Kicking myself that I could have bought 5 working toasters for the same price! Should have gone with Dualit if I wanted something pretty."
5,Not a good toaster - A great one!,I have been a proud owner of the 2-slice pro-line toaster since 2004. It's built like a tank. It has been made with quality like the KitchenAid mixer that everyone owns. My wife and I use it almost every single day before we go to work and it has given us consistent even toasting for breads and bagles. Not only does it look sharp in our ultra-modern kitchen but it performs better than any toaster I ever owned. What more could we ask? My family recommends it highly!
1,"real disappointment, when I thought I had made a smart investment","I have had this 2-slice toaster for about 4 months and stopped using it last week after I bought a $29 Oster as a replacement. Toasting bread with this Kitchen Aid takes about three times as long as a regular toaster. The highest setting (9) takes about 4 minutes to complete, yet toasts come out a little brown but still too soft for my taste (and I like them to be soft inside, not like biscotti!) For the second cycle, though, I have to readjust the setting to about 3-4, then pull down the lever, and finally turn the On/Off knob to turn the toaster on. Too many steps for one slice of bread. All in all, each slice takes about 6-7 minutes to toast.The toaster does look nice and is heavy, which I liked at first when I received it 4 months ago, and the signal it gives when the toasting cycle is complete is nice. But, in the end, who cares about that?? I prefer a toaster that fulfills its main function properly."
2,It only looks good,For the price of this toaster one can almost buy four of other brands which probably works a lot better. It weighs a ton and toasts unevenly. Toast takes a long time to brown. I would have never bought this toaster except that it was a gift. I have the red one and I guess it looks good in the kitchen. My sister-in-law said that one is paying for the novelty of the blue light that comes on when it is turned on and the buzzer that sounds when the toast is supposedly ready. Definitely not worth the price.
5,very good read,"The fresh, breezy stylfe of writing of the Dowager Duchess is a real treatto read!! You could imaagine that she was giving you a personal tour of Chatworth and its surroundings. If you have never been to Chatsworth, it will make you want to go. If you have visited Chatsworth, it will make you want to go back, with book in hand!!!Enjoy!!"
2,"Cute, but not worth it.","I bought this for my 6 year old daughter thinking it was so cute and would help her learn more about saving money and being a little more responsible. It is very cute, but doesn't hold much money at all and money gets jammed in it very easily. I really wouldnt reccommend it. It wont hold more then 10 bills in it, the drawer really is teeney tiny. Would be a good buy for a kid not looking to keep money in it for very long, but to me that defeated the purpose so now it is a toy, she likes to put her money in to see it count up but since it wont hold much she takes the bills back out and keeps them in something bigger. I like the sticker idea though, your child and you set a goal and at the goal she gets a sticker. Other then that , I wouldnt reccommend it."
4,Hy-C Black Chimney Cover,It's easy to install... It takes 15 mins to finish.. great product and cheapest solution.
1,"Mediocre, at best","An entire chapter is devoted to fan letters about the author's newsletter - and the ""advice"" consists of inanities such as ""If you subscribe to magazines you never read, don't renew them"". Well, duh! Who needed a $19 book to learn that?????????????Stick with The Tightwad Gazette trilogy ... Many, many practical suggestions. Although not everyone wants to live as thriftily as TG recommends, you can find many practical ideas there for your situation (whatever it is).This book could have been wonderful. Instead, it was just useless garbage. I've collected quotes since I was a teenager, but, even I found the author's endless quotations a waste of paper.This book was a big nothing!"
1,Not worth it,"If you want to be told that you should try on gloves at the thrift store before you buy them (duh!) or that you should always buy larger sizes of food, because they're always a better deal (they sometimes are, and sometimes aren't), then read this book. If you want something more intelligent, with real ideas and advice, try the Tightwad Gazette. Much, much better."
1,Not buying this book would be the most frugal thing of all!,"I bought this book 2 months ago and I am still kicking myself for spending the money. I found this book to be condescending, preachy and at times, down right irratating. I was looking for practical, sensible tips on how to live my life in a more frugal and environmentally friendly manner. All I got from this book was pie-in-the-sky, warm and fuzzy, painfully trite prose. It became increasingly obvious as I forced myself to plow through this book, page by sappy page, that McBride spent far too much time researching quotes as headers for her chapters. Had she spent anywhere near as much time writing about tried and true, honest to goodness money saving tips and techniques, this book would not be such a waste. To anyone considering this purchase, check it out of the library first to see if you like it, I sure wish I had."
3,Not for the truly frugal,"This author has read too many Martha Stewart Living and Victoria magazines--you can tell by some of the projects. She makes it seem as though frugality is something to be ashamed of and hidden at all costs by all of these fake luxuries. While she does have some good ideas, they get bogged down (not to mention hard to find) by all of her ""sermons"".This book is interesting to read once or twice, but not worth buying unless you can get it used."
2,bright? yeah right.,"The red flashers on this thing work well but it is incredibly dim. My regular cheap-o flashlights are many, many times brigher than this. I'd be surprised if you could see four feet in front of you in the dark, and the spot of light is quite small. I would only use the red flashers on this thing; I'll have to buy another regular flashlight for the car to go along with this piece of crap."
5,Sweet Love Story,This was a sweet story of a young widow raising children after her husband dies and trying to work their ranch. She takes in a stranger on a winter night and the friendship they form is so touching.Carol
1,Where is the rest of the story?,"Suki Black is a successful singer who catches the eye of industrialist Joel Harlow.This book is the requisite 180-something pages but it feels like half of the book is missing. I think Suki and Joel have about 4 meetings in the book. I believe that they agree to marry at the end but dont exchange any ""I Love You"".Very weird book."
2,stopped working,"used the velcro to mount in the bathroom. It ran for 2 months, then ran slow, then it stopped. Not worth the $10.00 price."
1,Clock Stopper,Sorry but this clock will not keep the correct time. It completely stops running for no reason. Glad it works for most of you. I must have a lemon.
2,Not what I was looking for,"I wanted to hang this in my locker at work. The double stick tape that came with it was poor (it fell off the first day) and if you do hang it some other way, you can't get to the back to access the buttons. It's also too hard to program. Should have bought something else."
1,Overpriced!,Made to stick to your dashboard or stick to something else. Does not stay illuminated and not worth more than $3.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"If you are looking for a product with some level of quality, don't even remotely consider this item. In fact, just take your money and go into your bathroom and flush it down the toilet. The end result is the same and you get instant gratification. The worst product I have ever purchased on Amazon."
2,The amazing flying clock,"This clock is lit, so you can read it at night. It's a nice design. But as far as being a good clock for your car, it kinda sucks. I had to reset it every couple of months because it consistently ran slow, even after changing to a fresh battery. Also, it simply will not stay put. Take a sharp curve, hit a speed bump, slam the door, and the thing flies off it's flimsy little slide and falls on the floor. Normally I'd tape it down, but that wasn't feasible because I kept having to go in and reset the time. All in all, cheap product, could be a lot better."
1,Four months to failure,Purchased this clock because it was basic and had a backlight. Backlight works that's a yeah. Numbers show but time doesn't advance. That's a nay.... To say the least it's junk. Overpriced for what you get. Try and find something else from wal-mart... Purchased in December started using in January and failure in March...
2,Not too good.,"The only way you can see what time this clock displays, is if you look straight ahead at it. If you move the clock up or down, or left or right, the display 'disappears'. Even if you light the background. I'm sure this is because of the lcd display design. Good luck with this clock..."
4,"Wonderful clock...lousy ""stick 'em""","Setting the clock was intuitive BUT..one extra button needs to be pushed to ""get it going"" otherwise time just stands still. Good size, easy to read in daylight, button to light and read at night is reasonable too! Stick 'em UNSTUCK on the first day over 80 degrees in my car. Does what I want it to....especially if I can get it STUCK!!"
3,It works...BUT,"it's not worth what i paid for it...made in china, of course, and at most it should be selling for $3! i'm keeping it cause it fits in the space i have it in, but i can't help feeling RIPPED-OFF!!"
2,Buzz,"The clock looks great and is large enough to see from everywhere in the vehicle. However, when the battery is inserted it makes a high pitched faint squeal, and is intolerable while driving."
4,Useful digital clock for golf cart,"Good inexpensive solution for a golf cart. Large numerals are easy to read, and it's handy to have the bluish backlight when it turns dark outside. Main problem is mounting because the back panel slides off too easily-- and that's where you usually want to attach the included mounting tape or some velcro strips. Need to tape the panel door shut to prevent the clock from falling off."
5,Wall Clock,"Excellent basic clock. Easy to use. Compact, not large and clunky like most other products are."
1,Too Dark a Clock,This picture of the clock is misleading. The back illumination is not on all the time. Only lit briefly and in a normal mode it is too dark to read 6 feet away.I gave it a one star for the size. Save your money.
2,Small not Large,"This clock is advertised as a large clock. The size was very small. The size can be found by looking at dimensions but should not be named ""Large"". Also, lighting does not stay on as it seems in the picture. The backlight only turns on when the button is held down."
1,Small clock review,"The clock was about 1/4 the size that I thought I was getting.The blue background shows only if you push a button, so it does not read at night, which is what I bought it for. All in all, not happy with the clock.Barbara E. Helm"
1,Item not as described.,The description for this clock is Large Lighted Readout clock. However that is not the case. The clock is so small and you can barely read the time. The light only stays on for 5 seconds with the push of a button. I would not recommend this product.
4,What I wanted.,"This little guy is just what I wanted. I have a 2001 CRV, and the clock just stopped working. This item fit over the existing clock and looks decent. Quick fix. The item gets 4 stars because the display would probably be hard to see in trucks where you would be sitting way above eye level. Also, you have to push the clock for it to light up (this makes sense or the battery would die fast).. it is a little hard to do while driving :)"
3,Works for me but needs to be reset often,"This digital clock works for the purpose I bought it for. I was able to mount it using the screws rather than the tape because the tape just doesn't work as well. I like that it is easy to remove from the mounting bracket to change the battery. I like that it is illuminated at the touch of a button. The only negative is that it doesn't keep time accurately, but it is close enough to still be of some value.In conclusion, if you need a very percise time keeping clock, this isn't the one for you. If you don't mind having to resent it periodically, then you will like it."
4,"Beautifull doll, OK accessory","I purchsed the goldie locks and the little red riding hood dolls. The dolls are better than my expectation. The maker of this doll also makes the Bratzs dolls. The doll's costume is well-made. Little red riding hood wears removable white socks and red shoes. The doll's face is very pretty with big green eyes, even the eyebrows are painted in great detail. Over all the doll is beautifully detailed. The accessories are OK quality. The basket handle just can't stay on. My only complaint is that the book comes with the set is really not that impressive: Very thin paper back with mostly words and just some little picture at the bottom of the page. The book is pretty small too."
4,Great for kids,This book does an excellent job explaining step-by-step how to crochet leis. These are not the fancy leis you see selling in stores in Hawaii. They are more for children crafts. Perfect for our daughter to learn how to crochet!
3,Appropriate for hanging on the bedpost in your trailer,"... but don't expect them to come out looking like the real thing. Perhaps, if you use a smaller hook and a finer yarn or even crochet thread you could produce more realistic results, unless that isn't the look you want."
5,Are you troubled or confused?,"I could read this book or listen to the audio hundreds of times and it is like new information every time. The concepts are fresh and straight forward, it can be a reference in times of trouble or confusion. Always a pleasure to get the core of any issue with ease and understandingWayne your the best!"
1,Not a Christian book,"I should have spent more time reviewing this book. The author tries to combine New Age philosphies with God. Sorry, but the two don't mix. Would give the book no stars if I could..."
4,almost the best camera,"Recently bought this camera, and although i'm very happy with it, there are a few remarks i'd like to make. I'm not getting exactly what i see on the lcd screen, that is, at the moment i press the button the image i get is different from the one i see on the lcd. This is due to some kind of auto correction the camera does by itself and cannot be turned off. If you buy this camera remember to buy at least two packs of rechargeable nimh (this is of extreme importance (for normal ones won't last 20 min), you should also get the ac adaptor for downloading pics. Also keep in mind the download is through a serial port, this is aprox 115000 bps, this means it's really slow (it can take up to 25 secs per image on fine mode). I don't know how good are those USB flash card readers, but i'm thinking seriously about buying one. But I have to say the quality of the images is impecable, i love it, even in jpg, they are just great!"
4,Great Digital Camera with many feature,"This is great camera with many features. You can take the pictures in many conditions. The flashlight is good enough for Indoor shooting. You can use the A-REC mode for automatic shooting & M-REC mode for manual Shooting. You will have a great photos just using A-REC mode. Just switch on the bottom & ready to take photos. If you want more professional photos use M-REC mode. You can adjust for the manual shutter speed or manual aperture. In this feature you customize your photos even you can bright your object at the poor light. The 2.11 mega pixels is good enough for viewing in the web, sending though E-mail & print in A4 paper. The worst think that I know is a battery live. This camera it's so hungry with power, that I thought same with the others digicam. For your convenient use a 3 set of NIMH batteries, which can take 30 to 40 pictures each set in normal used. You can save your battery live with minimize using LCD monitor to framing the object."
5,Coolpix a Winner,"This is my first digital camera, and have had if for a year. Takes great pictures in the ~500 KB file size range using JPEG compression in 1200 X 1600 mode. I've printed them on an HP 840 ink jet with glossy paper and 8 X 10 is magnificent!Internal flash is weakness, but I bought external flash and bracket and works quite well.I see no reason to buy more mega pixels which use more space on card. Optics are great too.I may buy another for my son before this is discontinued since it is an older model."
1,"Expected better results, was disappointed!","Having been a professional photographer for over 25 years I expected Nikon to produce superior results. Forget that the camera is difficult to use, the final quality of the pictures is poor. If you shoot only in sunlight or shadow it's OK, but mix them and the result is unacceptable. No latitude, or gamma, and even Photoshop fails to correct the problems. Maybe in the future, but until then, buy something to play with but use real film. I returned mine..."
2,Broken twice now,"Just before the warranty expired on this unit the ""lens side"" of the camera started to make clicking noises after turning it on, then displayed the dreaded ""System Error"" message on the LCD. Covered under warranty so no problem there. Probably about 4 months after the repair (and only 100 or so pictures) the unit now does the exact same thing. Only this time the repair bill is $$$ with absolutely no information from Nikon ... on what is actually wrong with the camera and/or if this is likely to happen again.When working, the camera is mostly fine and the reviews here ... are generally fair and accurate. Based on ourexperience with Nikon ... the unit's poor reliability I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
4,Quick Digital,"I've owned a Ricoh & a Nikon Digital. This blows away the Ricoh. I was such a nimrod for purchasing the Ricoh. Oh well, that's life. The only drawback to this one is when it's darker. Takes a little longer and some pics don't turn out as well as others I've seen. For business purposes, this is a great buy that works very quickly. Buy it."
4,USB cable?,"I share the Nikon 950 coolpix camera with my mom, she uses the serial cable provided, I would like to use a USB cable for it, but does anybody know where I can get a USB cable for this camera? Thanks for any help."
4,"yes, but","Out of the box, there is no doubt that nikon makes fine cameras, but... My experience has been that their repair facility takes months to return a camera and that it is not fixed when it is returned. I can't recommend it."
1,"Camera takes pictures, but good luck viewing them!","I've worked with all sorts of photography equipment and pictures/viewing software. Never have I been as frustrated as I am with the nikon lukewarmpix950 and its lame manual and lamer software programs. Nikon is not ready for the digital photography marketplace. The camera is not intuitive to use and the viewing software is nearly imposible to work with, IF you are even able to access it. I've never seen anything like this. This is the most user-unfriendly package I've ever witnessed. If you have not worked with digital cameras and digital picture-taking extensively, DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA. YOU WILL BE SORRY!"
1,SYSTEM ERROR,"Almost a year to the day after the camera was bought, i turn it on and it greets me with SYSTEM ERROR and a LOUD clicking noise coming from the lens side of the camera. lovely. haven't taken it in yet to see how much this is going to cost me.and this is with me ONLY taking approx 40 pictures."
4,Cool Camera,"I am really getting a kick out of my new Cool Pix 950. It a greatcamera, and with the rebate it's a great deal too. I've taken hundreds of pictures with it so far and like its sleek design that makes it easy to whip out of the case to shoot pictures on the fly. One thing I thought was pretty lame was their CD manual. I guess they thought they'd save some money by doing it this way. When I'm out with on a hiking trip with my camera and I need to find out some information...all I have to do is pop the CD into my computer, set up my solar battery array and run the CD...right? Someone at Nikon wasn't thinking about the customer. I'm also thinking about getting a flash memory card reader for fast downloading to my computer. The software that comes with the camera is too slow and wears on the batteries. All in all, the camera is a great picture taking device."
2,A poor book that isnt worth the price,I used this book when i wrote a term paper. The book uses multiple sources but I was disapointed by the quality of scholarship.
5,Brillant,"This series is so clever, inspiring and just brillant, its the type of series that you will remember for years to come..the best I have ever read and will remain my favourite."
4,Good Typical Yarn,"Star Trek series and movies have a positive, upbeat attitude about our future as a race. Two BIG necessaries: anti-matter power and Faster than light (FTL) technologies. If humans have to develop these themselves, the timeline may be a bit stretched. This movie shows one possible way that we join the space-faring races while having fun at it."
4,Its the nibbler that makes sense,There are other nibblers on the market that are not good at cutting plastic as they don't actually have a knife like this one that chops away little bits at a time.
4,Takes small bites,"I bought the nibbler for separating a piece of sheet metal that is 16 feet long, and of an irregular shape that is difficult to cut with shears.After the first several nibbles, I realized that the small bite will take an extremely long time make a 16 foot long cut.While the tool does a nice job cutting very small chips, it will probably take me about 30 minutes of nibbling to make this long cut.I will be looking for an air driven nibbler to make the long cut that needs to be done.Just keep in mind that this nibbler, makes little ""nibbles"" (pun intended) of the sheet metal. :)Jim."
3,"Great for guidelines, horrible for realistic specifics.","This is a great idea that wasn't very well thought out. It uses the same sort of archetypal explanations which are the trademark of our great game of Shadowrun, but the problem is that too many monsters, especially the larger ones, simply don't have enough detail to them. The biggest example is the Juggernaut which looks impressive on paper, but my God! Any small group of characters could take one down with upper middle class ammo. The things size makes little melee weapons useless, yet you could supposedly kill one with a bowie knife with enough di-koting!!! Get the book, but be prepared to make lots of little side notes on almost all of the monsters."
2,content,"I didn't like the overall content of the book, it's missing some chart data such as the actual countdown excerpts and the weekly top 40 charts that includes the whole top 10 songs of that era."
3,Hagen Catit Drinking Fountain,I puchased this fountain for my two cats. One has a habit of throwing and tipping her water bowl. But I had to return this product because the water foundation didn't work with the cats. The one cat was getting on top of the fountain and still splashing the water. It would of been fine if I had different cats.
4,Great product,"The reason I'm on this site now is that it's time to buy another Cat-it. I've had mine for nearly two years. The warranty is for only one year! I've never used another brand, so can't compare them, but this one solved the problem of our two cats trying to drink out of the bathroom sink, which my husband detests. It IS a pain to clean, and I find it necessary to clean it every 5-7 days. This frequency is probably due to the fact that it is located in a high traffic area in my kitchen (near the door to the deck) as I have nowhere else to put it. But the cats love it and drink more water now. So I'm buying another since we wore out the first one!"
4,very good product for a great price.,"I am very happy with this product. As stated in the directions, I only clean the product out once a week, and just add a little water to the bowl when the water gets low. If only there was a way to keep the cats from getting pieces of food in the bowl. When that happens, you pretty much have to clean the whole thing out. It works great, and the cats really seem to like it. I found this product to be much less expensive than competitive products. I am glad I went with this one. I bought the replacement filter 3-pack when I made the original purchase and am glad I did."
4,2 yrs now and going strong,"After seeing the negative reviews thought I'd add my own positive ones..my cat loves this and cuts down on my other fountain drinking..It's easy to clean and have never had a noise, vibration or gurgling problem ( I have on a dollar store cat pad) goes for at least a week without filling..instead of replacing pump, I ran a mild clorox solution through it to clean once to twice a year, even in the water bowl itself and rinsed well. This brought pump back to new level of flow and reduced algae etc in dome. Unfortunately after >2 yrs of use, Its getting pretty scratched up and the base itself got a crack in it,from me picking it up, which is why I'm looking for a new one.It's still functions..just think time for new one with the crack rather than replacing parts. My cat will only drink on dome and not from bowl so others not option. I paid $40 at a pet store. This is really good price."
5,Excellent For Kitties,My cats simply love this fountain. It's very easy to set up....fill...and cleaning it is a snap. Thanks
4,Good drinking fountain for pets,"I really took a gamble to buy this item since most review wasn't specific and the picture really doesn't show anything, but once I got it in the mail I was glad I bought it.The water flow from bottom to top via a central canal and the water spread out onto the dome-shaped area, there is even a small bowl to collect water in case ur pet wants to drink from the bowl. It hold about half a liter of water in the tank, which I like very much. I had petmate fresh flow before and it holds so little water that I had to refill every 2-3 days for my two cats. But now with this one, it can last about 5-6 days.The only drawback is you must have an even surface to put this on, otherwise the water will not flow evenly down the dome. But you can adjust the surface with folded newspaper to make it even."
2,Great for the first year - gets clogged thereafter - not impressed,"We loved this fountain when we first got it. We had the other Fresh Flow type before, and thought this one looked pretty neat. The filters for this are quite expensive, and basically hard to find in our area. The cat dish itself gets slimey pretty quick if you don't take it apart regularly. The spring on the part you have to push down to fill it up, stops catching so you have to hold it down while you fill it. You also have to keep up with taking the pump apart and cleaning it, or the water will stop pumping. I think this is a good product for the short-term, however I recommend the other brand if you want something that lasts and is a LOT easier to clean."
2,not as i anticipated,"i was expecting a large flow of water cascading over the dome. what i got was a very small stream over one part of the dome. i tried to send back...they sent another instead to ""try again"". this was a smaller stream over the dome..requested mailing labels to send both back. was sent two us postal service labels. sent back and they arrived on my doorstep again. called again..should have been FED x labels..still waiting for pick up. QUITE A HASSEL TO RETURN AND TOTALLY DISSATISFIED WITH PRODUCT...TWICE."
4,"My cats are pleased, and so am I!","I checked out the reviews for all the other cat fountains and when I discovered that they don't filter debris I looked for something better. This is made in Germany, filters water, hair, etc. and is easy to clean. I ordered it direct from Petdirect. My cats were drinking out of my homedic fountain, (I think they thought is was a gift for them!) and it was getting old and hard to clean. They drink a lot of water out of this but it holds 3 liters so that is just one more plus."
3,Cat-It water fountain,"The Cat-it water fountain assembly showed some risk ofcross-threading the top handle onto the dome water tank.Also, aligning the dome to the water bowl perfectlytakes some patience. Other than that it was very easy.My 18 y.o. cat went up to it and drank from the bowl soonafter I set it up. The next day it was drinking from thesides of the dome and the bowl.I noticed that when the dome water tank is removed, debrison the dirty side of the filter goes over the filter to theclean side. Eventually this debris would recirculate andend up on the filter media again. I refill every two weeksso I clean the entire fountain rather than just refillthe dome.To get the maximum fountain water capacity fill the dometank to the very top. Put about a half Liter of water inthe bowl. When the tank is added, not much water willbubble out of it and down into the bowl."
4,Cats love the fountain!,"I have 13 cats and they all just love this fountain. They are fascinated by the water cascading down the dome, and drink from it frequently. Easy to set up and maintain. Nice size, but it needs refilling every other day - probably because of the number of cats using it here.The only concern I have about it is the power adapter is hot to the touch. Supposedly it's normal according to Hagen.com who makes the fountain, but it is still a concern to me. So far, it hasn't been a problem though. This is the reason for the 4 star rating instead of 5."
3,CatIt Does Always Doit,"Followup on previous higher rated post. Fountain is 3 months old and has stopped distributing water evenly over the bubble. In fact it trickles down the back, furthest from the bowl and is noisy. I noticed it only because the cats were licking it and making whining sounds.I did all the fixes recommended, reseated the fountain, rubbed with hands to deal with hypothetical static, pumped vinegar water through it for an hour, made sure it was level, made sure it was tilted. Tilted worked best, resulted in water being distributed over a larger portion of the bubble, but not the entire bubble. Overall, I think fountains are a last resort. They deliver clean fresh water when they work. They are power dependent (what happens to cats without power, as happens in winter storms where I live?), prone to breakdown, harder to clean than a daily fresh bowl of water. Unfortunately, I have a cat who thinks water bowls are for splashing on the floor, so I am stuck."
2,Drinkwell was WAY better,"After trying this one, for several days, I worked on and put back into operation our several year old Drinkwell cat fountain. This thing was more expensive and not even close in ease of use or performance. Not to mention that the cat needed a great deal of encouragement to use it."
1,Don't waste your money,"Another one for the junk pile. Just got it and at 2nd fill it stopped. Plus it took up alot of space for the little water it held, and has to almost be taken apart to fill. Neither my dog or my cat ever figured out to lick the dome."
1,Didn't last.,"The pump broke within 2 weeks and I haven't been able to find a replacement. The water level was not below the pump (aka it did not burn up). It would be under warranty but I threw away the paperwork (my bad) because usually I keep everything and then it just clutters up and I never have a problem. However, I still think the product should last a little longer than that! I purchased mine at petsmart and we live too far away to return it although I had tossed the box, etc.Also, when it did work, it wasn't quiet. I would agree that the noise level of the pump did fluctuate as stated by an earlier reviewer."
5,Multi Small Pet Friendly,"I love the Catit Fountain - I have 2 cats and a rabbit and they can all drink out of it at the same time. The bunny and young cat prefer the dome and my older cat prefers the bowl part so there is abundant harmony at the water bowl. It is very easy to clean (I do it about once a week in the dishwasher), much quieter than the Drinkwell and comes (when I got it) with a hard cord cover making it particularly bunny friendly."
1,Piece of junk.,"I got this for my wife when the original filter/pump we had started leaking all over the floor after 2 years. I thought it looked cool and the cats and I typically agree on things like that. After the first month it stopped pumping water over the dome. I found that this was because the ""cotton"" aspect of the fliter flakes off and gets jammed up in the filter. I finally figured out how to clean it, but to keep it running it's a weekly process. Today I noticed that the pump had burned out, the cotton had gotten inside causing the motor to die. I can't find a replacement pump online, e-bay or anywhere else. I think I'll go get a new filter system today and get rid of this piece of junk.Jeff"
2,great when it works,bought this in april - cats loved it and i loved it. easy to fill. got replacement filters for it and then it started getting gunky and slimy so i washed in water by hand with no chemicals and using just my hand to clean it. made sure pump was flowing good and put it back together and it stopped working. The water instead of flwing nicely over the dome started spurting out in heavy streams flooding the floor. I've taken it apart and put back together several times and keep coming back to a flood. Called the company who sent me to the m aker Hagen and that wasnt a good experience either. At this point my only options are to send back and get money back or send to manufacturer and let them look it over lolreally disapponited in this product and all parties involved in selling it
1,Most enjoyment was smashing it on my patio,"I have a Drinkwell Platinum and bought the Catit large to get something more quiet. It is easy to assemble and take apart. Locating the top bowl is easy after you figure it out the first time. The main problem is that no amount of fiddling with the bowl can fix the glaring design flaw that puts the pump input JUST below the water level. This thing works for while then starts sucking air even when the bowl is full of water. It is also frustrating to get the water to flow over the outer side of the bowl where the cats can get to it without getting behind the unit where the power cord is. So you fiddle with it, get it working, then 10-20 minutes later the pump starts sucking air again. I took it out back and smashed it on the patio - that was my most enjoyable part of owning this piece of garbage.I am using the Drinkwell again and will put up with it's noise. Petmate is also OK (I had a low capacity model before my Drinkwell Platinum)."
3,Good functioning fountain but unable to clean all of it when needed,"The fountain worked great, had a quite motor, didn't make a lot of noise from the water running either, and for the most part was easy to clean, except the dome that held the water. It's sealed shut with only a small opening to let water in, but I started to have these yellow spots around the little air hole with no way to clean the inside. I was too worried it was something that could make my cats sick, so I threw it out and got a different fountain by Cat-It that didn't have a separate reservoir so I was able to clean everything. Love the Cat-It brand products, just wish they had made a way for the dome to come apart for complete cleaning."
3,Works OK- Pain To Clean,"This product does work for us. Our veterinarian recommended a recycling water fountain for our old cat who doesn't drink enough water. Now, our cats love it (all four of them). It is a pain to clean and the pump gets clogged up *very* easily. The carbon filter is useless as far as maintaining water quality, but I still use it as it catches some of the cat fluff before it clogs up the pump. This drinking fountain doesn't really hold a lot of water so I top it off every day or two, and then take it apart for cleaning once a week. Like I said, cleaning it is kind of awkward and a pain.If I had to buy another water fountain again, I'd probably research some other brands before purchasing, but for the price, this one does ok."
3,it is not that great...,"my cat used to like to drink from the sink, now he does it alot less often. I am glad to have the fountain so I know he can have running water 24/7. It does need cleaning once a week. my water always flow all over the dome, but sometimes you have to wait for like an hour before it does."
4,"Looks Good, Hold Lots of Water, Cats Love it. Bad Construction","I bought this fountain about two years ago. I love the design of the fountain, and our four cats love using it. Yes, there are issues with even flow over the dome, but it's never been a big deal (the cats can find the water fine).We've had the other two major fountains in the house, and this is as good as the Drinkwell fountain, and MUCH better than than the other one. The resevior lasts as long as the Drinkwell, but the fountain is much less messy (once set up).The only reason I did not give the fountain five starts is that it is hard to fill the resevior, the fountain is also hard to clean by hand (though the dishwasher does a good job), and the pump burnt out last week, and the replacement pump costs as much as a new fountain.All that being said, I'm purchasing a replacement for it despite the problems because we like it so much."
3,Seems to work well but the cats HATE it!,"I bought this ""kitty fountain"" to substitute for leaving a faucet running for my cats. (My 13-year-old male won't drink enough from a regular bowl of water and suffers physically if I don't.)The Hagen fountain works exactly as specified, it's easy to assemble and pretty quiet in operation. However, none, NONE of my 4 cats will drink from it! It might be the slight sound from the pump, or the vibration, or just the oddity of water sliding down the dome, I don't know. But in all good conscience I wouldn't recommend this product to a cat owner. Dogs would probably do fine with it."
4,Good alernative to your cat drinking from the sink....,"That is what my cat was doing, and it was clogging up the drain - all that hair! This product got her to go back to the dish. The water is fresh - stays fresh, cool and it's also a fairly quiet device. I had a little trouble getting the water to flow over the entire domed surface, but eventually it did.I would absolutely recommend it, especially for those finicky cats with strange drinking habits."
1,Disappointed,"Wouldn't buy another one, ended up throwing it away. The filter doesn't work very well so the pump gets clogged and gunky and very difficult to clean. The bowl itself is a pain to clean as well. Buy a fish tank and a cheap pump, the cat loves it and it costs the same and lasts longer."
1,This thing sucked,"Barely recycled the water, cat learned how to shove her paws underneath it and clogged it. Also, grew mold terribly and water dosent really stream or run. Wound up replacing this with the Drinkwell Platinum"
1,TERRIBLE!! DO NOT BUY,"We bought this about two months ago for our two cats. From the begnining we encountered small problems. The pin thing in the bottom would go flying everytime we tried to fill it and it made it extremely hard to fill. Then the pump started running extremely loud after about three weeks. Eventually the entire thing just stopped working, no water would go over the dome at all. Even with regular cleaning it always felt gross and dirty. We bought a new on (different brand) this weekend which is much easier and quieter. I will never buy anything from this company again."

2,size matters,"The aqua fitness jog belt was too large. The listing did not indicate how to measure for correct size so I must return it.,"
2,not comfortable,"I purchased this belt to wear in my water aerobics classes. I find that it creeps up under my arms no matter how tightly I adjust the strap. It starts out fine but shortly after I get into the deep water, I find the belt becomes uncomfortable as it moves up from where it belongs."
3,Speedo Aqua Fitness Job Belt - Large/X-Large,"I ordered the Large/X-Large belt. It might fit an extra large child, but not an adult of 250 lbs. I received an instant refund."
2,"Too bulky, not a good jogger...",This jogger belt is way too big and bulky! It also does not distribute my weight properly so I end up floating on my stomach. Poor design!
1,Disappointing,"I was expecting a hard plastic type of casing for this product and not the inexpensive foam that went with it. The foam easily gets damaged because of its inferior material and does not look like it will last long. The size is supposed to be for small/medium. However, it was very difficult to adjust because the strap woud not stay in place and would loosen when in use. Unlike a similar product, the foam did not wrap well in the body and would slip making it difficult to run with it. I expected more from a Speedo product."
4,Purchased for snorkel trip,"I purchased a small for me and an XL for my husband for a snorkel trip. It worked excellent for me. I could stop and adjust my mask without needing to tread water. It was nicer than a vest pushing up under my chin. I'm 5'5 and 125 pounds. Also, it worked best to wear the buckle in front otherwise it was too much floation for being face down in the water.My husband, who is not a swimmer, tried it out in the pool and it was not enough to support him for adjusting mask. It however did work very well for him snorkeling around the pool. We had him try both mine and his and that was enough flotation but then a little ackward with 2 on. He is 6' 245 lbs. He didn't end up snorkeling. May try a vest for him next time."
3,Not designed for Deep Water Aerobics,These water floats are too wide and thick for Deep Water Aerobics. It will not allow some arm movements without scraping the float. I would recommend somehting thinner and one that does not wrap around quite as much.
3,Speedo Aqua Jogger,"I love the Speedo Aqua Jogger but the cheap belt has torn several places and there is no replacement parts. I have been sewing it over and over. The foam will withstand the chlorine water for a long time. I am disappointed I have to buy a new jogger every time the belt tears. Why not sell replacements, or better yet, make a belt that has more lasting power."
3,Bag is too big,"I like the bag, it is different from the diaper bags in the retail store. The only draw back is the size, its too big. I have trouble putting it in the bottom of my stroller. It is also very heavy to carry when I put the neccessities for my baby in it."
4,Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 712C Color Ink Jet Printer,"I have had my HP 712C for nearly 3 years, and it has proven to be very reliable with no problems what so ever. This is my first printer, and because of the low cost I was very suprised at the quality of the print. The black & white text is professional quality, the color is true, and the color photographs are very nice. The biggest negative is the printing speed. Text is fast but graphics will try your patience. I believe that this is a great first printer for anyone. It is easy to use, easy to load fresh ink modules and paper. This is a good printer that I have been very happy with and would recommend."
5,OUTSTANDING INKJET PRINTER,"I purchased a 712c HP injet printer so long ago I can't tell you when it was but it has been an outstanding printer. Never have any problems with it no matter what Windows(95, 98 or Me)I have used. You can print great colored pictures on it. I have a digital camera and it prints great 5x7 pictures and smaller ones. They look like I have had them developed. My only draw back right now is that I print a lot of pictures or picture cards so the printing speed is to slow for me for color printing. I wish HP would take trade-ins for a new Printer because this printer is in the same shape it was in when I purchased it and have not ever had to have it worked on. I just print a lot of pictures so I need a faster printer."
1,Great... when it works... which is basically never.,"I really want to like this printer. When it prints, the results are wonderful. The problem is, to say it's prone to jamming up is an understatement. NOTHING I can do can keep this this running. I spend my days hand feeding it pages.... and still having 10+ sheets get destroyed in the process. I'll never buy another HP product in my life."
2,Kinda cheap feeling,"My husband saw a similar cap @ a Fair @ Christmastime and I was trying to find one for him. This looked great, but after receiving it....it feels & looks light & cheap, and fits funny, although it's the correct size. I would like to return it & keep looking...."

Danny Thomas a german? the cigar smoke routine and other annoying forced farce quite annoying, but the music!!! still singing that See You in My Dreams all day and guess Gus Kahn's lyrics a bit player vs the scores... feel good, revival and much stand by your side characterization... try to deflect the aging process blips and chronology questions, the ending brings a tear or two and leaves you desiring eternity for talent."
3,"Average and unmemorable, but songs are good",This ultra-sentimental musical starts off weak and ends that way. Songwriter Day falls in love with musician Thomas and guess what happens after. Elements don't always click in this one.
3,It's great...but...,"I really like this little scale. However I have one big issue with it: It isn't calibrated! Perhaps the jostling during shipping screwed it up somehow, but with the plastic bin on top it's exactly 11g over 0, when it should be calibrated to 0. Without the basket it's negative many grams/oz. But the plastic bin and lid are nice. For the price though, it wouldn't be a deal-breaker if I suddenly needed to buy a new one again. Luckily I can count too, so when I weigh food I just subtract 11g each time."
2,Yopu get what you pay for...,"So I ordered this to weigh my son's Pinewood Derby car. (Which should be as close to 5oz as possible.) I bought some 2oz metal weights that I could attach to the car. After manually adjusting the tare on the scale, I weighed those in order to determine how accurate the scale was. Each time I weighed the 2oz weights (sometimes singly and sometimes together) I got different results. Not by a lot, but this scale is very inaccurate when weighing small amounts. I'm not particularly happy with it. Oh well... I bought it for the size and price. And I guess you get what you pay for."
2,won't work anymore,"I've had this for about a year. All of a sudden it won't calibrate anymore. If I can't get it to start at zero, then I can't really use it. If it wasn't for that I'd be extremely satisfied with it."
2,Not at all precise,"The scale looks good, but won't measure with any precision. The tare knob works just fine, until the basket moves. Then, what was set to zero suddenly reads 3 ounces - bump it again, and it's suddenly negative two. I can estimate better than that. Maybe it was just my scale (everyone else seems happy with it), but I'm returning it."
2,"okay, but broke easily","I bought this for about $3.50. I tested it many times after buying it and it seemed accurate. However, it broke less than a month after buying. It takes a little more weight now to push the scale down for some reason, so something inside must have broken, which means it's useless now. I didn't bother to go back to the store and return it, and I'd rather invest in a digital scale now."
4,Cheap and Reliable!!!,The scale is good for small measurement. It is compact and easy to use. The quality of the plastic is good given the price and seems durable. I would definitely recommend this product for people on a budget.
2,Not Good at all,"Until last week, it worked...not very well...but it worked. Having purchased this in April 2012, it lasted approximately 9 months. During this time I have constantly had to readjust it via the small wheel at the top in back. That is a bother. Now even that doesn't work. I can put a single coffee filter on it and it measures 8 ounces...WRONG! Never again will I purchase anything like this again. My advice is to go Digital!"
3,Not a good scale,"Much smaller and much worse than I expected. It was made in China, but the scale I bought in China is better than this. Really hard to rectify it. Just so so."
1,Quite simply--one of the worst books I've ever read!,"Disgusting, depraved people, a plot that was insulting (the tzar's daughter? oh, yeah!) and banal, cliched writing!I wish I could give it no stars."
2,Frustrating book,"This book has all the right ingredients for a successful mystery debut, but...I am aware that Ms. Nadel frequently visits Turkey. One would have to assume that she has some special connection with the place. Even so it is impossible to take the uterly false peacuful and tolerant nature of the Turkish society. It is hard to imagine that in a country, where even the mention of horrific genocide on Armenians in 1912 can get you in jail, people of different religions live in harmony. It is very easy to be democratic and tolerant when there are almost no Orthodox Christians left in Turkey. Ms. Nadel has a flair for characters but the plot of her debut is so outlandish that this reader lost his patience multiple times.I'll be willing to try one more of her novels. Perhaps these were the pains of a writer novice."
2,Big Disappointment,"Granted this is a first effort but where were the editors? Having read positive items about this author, I expected better. At least 200 pages could have been cut and the book would be less boring, less convoluted and more interesting."
4,Good story,"I find jarring use of language from time to time, as if she's unfamiliar with English idioms but the story moves me forward."
4,"Unfortunately, the Reader is Left Wanting","Nadel usually writes a good book and this one is good -- riveting good through most of it. But the denouement stinks and in fact is ridiculous. It forces the reader to ask if the time invested is worth the outcome. For me, it was, as it ends with overtones from a mystery far more sensational and well-known that the one dealt with here in this book. Nadel knows Istanbul well, but, despite what the book jacket would have you believe, she is no Donna Leon of Venice fame. She makes little effort to give us the sights and sounds of the neighborhoods of which she writes, unlike the peripatetic Leon. Inspector Ikman is a worthy character and, in fact, saves this book from being worse. I'm glad I read it and look forward to reading more of Nadel, but I felt this is not one of her best works."
1,Save your money,"My wife suffers from deppression, so I was looking forward to hearing how Emme and her husband survived. Unfortunately, Emme's was the only honest voice in the book. The sections from Phillip's perspective lacked sincerity in my mind, and so, any value to me as a reader.This one really let me down."
4,You can live in India without leaving home.,"I heard Janette Turner Hospital interviewed on public radio, and researched her at Amazon. I'm glad I did.If you have the least amount of wanderlust in you, with just a touch of yearning for the experiences of living in South India, get this book. You can do all the aforementioned without leaving home.Ms Turner-Hospital has written a descriptive account of life for an expatriate in India. Her story is a good one, with sufficent drama to keep you interested, all the way to the last climactic events. And she paints a very good picture as she tells the story. I felt I could draw every building and every scene.The book is hard to find. I bought mine from Amazon, second hand, in pristine condition.Now, please excuse me. I think my vindaloo is about to burn."
3,Not a High Quality Edition,"I'm a fan of Corsica so I ordered this book to get a glimpse of the island more than a century ago. Edward Lear's illustrations are beautiful.This paperback edition is not easy to read though. For instance, the text on pg 13 is missing, some of the pages are repeated and the print is very small. That's why I'm giving it 3 stars.Apart form being a great travel destination for it's unspoilt beauty, this is still true today as it was in the 19th century: ""there are no beggars in Corsica"", (even in this global recession)."
4,"good entertainment, great music","This DVD has 2 concerts on it. The sound and picture quality on the first concert is absolutely dreadful! It is like the quality you would expect on an old super 8 movie. However, the second concert is 100% with both vision and sound and really justifies the purchase. If you like to watch and hear some very professional musicians enjoy their craft you will enjoy this DVD."
5,The Ventures; Still Great,"This DVD is a must for fans of The Ventures. It is compendium of live performances and the musicianship most impressive. The music is great and there are several moments that are moving. One in particular is watching Mel Taylor's son Leon pull off his father's solo on Caravan without missing a beat. He has evolved into a truly great drummer, although Mel is still my favorite. The bottom line is simple, this DVD is an excellent addition to anyone's collection. The Ventures are the most significant instrumental group Rock and Roll has yet to see. Their influence can be seen in the guitar work of some of the best guitarists around today and very few drummers on the contemporary scene have been left untouched by Mel Taylor's contributions."
4,A good handbook for my work,"THis is the 3rd year in a row I bought this book. First year it was a gift and I thought it would be typical horoscope stuff which I find useless. However, this book includes monthly forecasts for how the month will go in personal and professional life and for me its very good. these monthly trends are very useful and for me, being a Regional Sales Mgr in the electronics industry, the book has kept me focused on the things I need to watch for to ensure work goes smoothly. I dont use the feng shui portion of the book much but overall, the book is the well worth the price."
1,padded seat,"Don't buy this seat. After one week the front lid bubbles opened and with no seal their is room for bacteria growth. Very disappointed with the quality control on this seat. The comfort is a 5, but can not risk the hygiend issue so had to throw it away, what a waste of money. I wonder if the company would send me a replacement?"
1,Not for me!,"I didn't care for this stuff one iota! I cant put my finger on why its not for me but it's not. Its very floral but hides something much deeper that antagonized my scent glands to no end. I frankly couldn't wait for the scent to ware off. But in all fairness, im sure its for somebody out there but not for me."
2,Not for 20 somethings,"This is, of course, only my opinion, but I did not care for this at ALL! I tried my best to scrub it off as soon as I could. The smell is not horrendous or anything, but reminded me exactly of what my great-grandmother used to smell like! I would definitely recommend this if you are over 70."
5,Love it.,"Bottle is much larger than I expected, and very attractive. It arrived quickly and in good order. I was very pleased with this product."
3,Nice design & packaging,The Kenzo Flower parfum bottle and packaging is beautiful & impressive.Five stars.I had never smelled this fragrance prior to ordering so I wastaking a chance. HOWEVER I only rate the fragrance as three stars.KateCalifornia
3,Kenzo Flower,"I am not sure how to rate this product. I originally purchased Kenzo Flower in a 3.4 ounce / 100 ml bottle through Amazon andreceived a 3.3 ounce / 100 ml bottle. The shipping was fast and secured, the fragrance is nice, however I was not aware thatthis was made in a 3.3 ounce / 100 ml bottle, not sure if the original. I am still waiting for what I ordered and paid for, KenzoFlower in a 3.4 ounce bottle."
5,Excelente como regalo,"Presentación muy estilizada y elegante, ideal como para regalo, tiene un llora floral muy delicada, lo recomiendo sin ningún problema"
5,I'm in love!!!!,"Our my favorite perfume!What can I say, very simple that I would love some!Arrived with no problems, fast delivery, perfect price, sealed and important ...Worshiping him ... hehehe"
4,Cute phone!,"I got this phone for Christmas, and I adore it! It feels good in your hand, an adorable color, and has decent reception! My only complaint is there is no hold button, and there is no flash button... But the volume switch is on the side, and it works well... very clear! This phone has a redial, and you can program numbers in it (I haven't done that, though). Great for a 900MHz phone, but I wouldn't use it as the main phone in the house. Good for a kitchen or bedroom phone. Overall, I like it! :o)"
2,"What's with the ""wind""????","First I had the blue one, then, thinking color would matter, got the dark green (but it is identical other than color). With BOTH of these, I had the phone for 6 months or so, and then, starting 5 minutes into a call, what can only be described as ""wind"" would start in the background (both I and the other person i was talking to could hear it). It would get louder and louder until you could not hear the person and it sounded like they were in a blizzard. This thing was on the charger whenever I wasn't on it (ie: all day when I was at school/work, and all night), so I don't get it. I bought a new battery, and it didn't make a difference. When it happened with the 2nd one i got (which was in a different city, so I know it wasn't my phone line), I'd had enough. All it is good for is a ""ringer"" that I could answer and run with it to my other bedroom phone. I can't explain it, but I'm not buying another one!!!"
4,"Good phone, good price","I had an aging Sony cordless and picked this phone up from Amazon. The price ($30) for a 900mhz phone is excellent. The handset fits well in my hand and between my neck and shoulder if I need to use both of my hands for a moment. The buttons are large and easy to push. Sound quality is good and I haven't experienced any cross-talk interference at all (we have 2 other 900mhz phones in the house.) The blue color is fun and matches my iMac. My only critique would be that the phone doesn't have a headset jack, but at $30, who's complaining?"
4,"Fun phone, lacks call waiting button","I bought 2 phones for my 8 and 6 year old sons. The phones are a good value and look fun. They feel good to hold. The only drawback is the lack of a call waiting button, which is very necessary when they are on a long conversation."
1,"all looks, no quality","This phone is pleasing to the eye, but I found that this phone was too clunky. When holding this phone on your shoulder, you may end up hanging up on the person. The talk button sticks out in a way that its easy to hang up with a slight touch of your ear. My roomate had this phone at college and didn't find it handy at all. I would have liked to have a redial button too. The volume could be raised so that your own voice would be louder, but the person to whom you're speaking will still sound distant. Sound quality was bad once I walked in to the next room as well. I don't recommend buying this phone."
5,fun colors!,the colors you can choose from are awesome! having a phone that is 900 mhz is great. like i said the colors add life to your desk or counter! recomended by me! easy to hold on to!
1,"Works fine, the first time...","Bought this for a rafting trip for our family. Took lots of great shots, took the film out for processing (after a little trouble rewinding the roll.) Tried repeatedly to put in a new roll of 35mm film for another adventure, but after many attempts, going over & over the instructions, determined that the camera was broken. The wheel that is supposed to advance the film didn't work properly, and although the wheel would turn, the little teeth that the film is supposed to grab onto didn't move, prohibiting me from installing new film. This ended up being a single use camera, rather than an environmentally friendly, reloadable camera. Boo."
2,how to lose faith in a book quickly,"On page 13 of this little book, under the heading ""BLUE NOTE"", you'll find:""The term 'blue note', usually associated with the famous jazzrecord label and New York club, in fact refers to the diminished fifth-the basic building-block chord of the blues."""
5,Good product,This product works as advertised. First cream I've found which actually softens areas on my feet. So good I put it on my subscribe and save subscription.
4,Helpful to Pass,"Found the book helpful to pass the exam with a high score. The cd isn't all that valuable. Would have appreciated a simulated test on the cd. As with most cert books, you may want to look at multiple sources (test sites, other books, videos, etc.) to get a more complete grasp on the topic."
4,Good but could be better,"This vest is comfortable, but not snug or high-riding like I had hoped. It is too lose for running, but it does conform well to the body so it feels almost naturally comfortable. I do like the open mesh type material the vest is made of to help it breath while you sweat. It seems to be pretty sturdy, and I like the price for a 'training' type vest. When I can handle the weight consistantly and I get ready to run, I will look into something more suited to the movements."
3,"Well constructed, but underweight","I've enjoyed almost daily use of my vest since its arrival. However when I received the vest, the first thing I did was count the weights. Yes, there were 20 of them there. I then weighed them on our scale used for postage (meaning that it is accurate) and the total for all the steel weights was only 17 pounds! I then put the vest itsself on the scale and it was still just 18 pounds. I'm disappointed that two pounds is missing, that's 2 bars of steel that should have been included.Other than that, the construction of the vest is done well and so far it seems like a quality product. Just disappointed at not getting my full 20 pounds of weight."
3,Honest but unfinished,"This book is a compilation of several women's and men's experiences of rape. Graphic and difficult to read in places, it can definitely help a survivor of rape feel not so alone. What the book lacked, however, was a sense of moving on...the idea that one can move beyond the trauma of rape to embrace a full and satisfying life and even thrive in that life. There were only one or two accounts that addressed building a life worth living. Survivors desperately need to know that there can and will be more to life than the consuming agony that sexual assault brings with it. Survivors need to know that with hard work and perseverence they can move beyond the pain. This book fails to deliver that message. It was incredibly depressing to read several accounts which focused solely on the misery of life , unbearable pain and hopelessness. While it is a gift to not feel alone, we need more than that. We all need to know that healing and leading a full life is possible..."
5,Solid Swinging Piano,"A typical Sutton set, if a little short on full blooded stride. Sutton's impressive ballad skills are to the fore here, with a range of 1930s showtunes and pieces from the repertoire of Fats Waller.Recorded live, the audience is unobtrusive. However, as with all Cafe des Copains recordings, the piano is rather tinny, which is a pity when the performer has as powerful a left hand as Sutton.Recommended."
4,bittersweet,"An excellent movie, Angie Everhart was a Refreshing departure from the normal helpless female, a sharp intelligent lady with a lot of positive mental attitude, More of the same Please!!"
5,Excellent music,"This is a great group and the music (vocals and lyrics) are well worth listening to and using as a praise instrument for worship. Okay a song can sound good and great but the song isn't worth much unless the lyrics are just as well. None of that repetition (i.e. Jesus, Jesus said over like 100 times). Scriptually based. I've used most of these songs in youth activities and games. One game: Swords Up! As the song is playing participants are to find the scripture quoted in the song or a related Bible text that the song may make reference to."
5,Praising God through unbelievable harmonies.,"Acappella succeeds once again at praising the Lord. This is one of my favorite Acappella CDs of all time. Songs like, How Can I Truly Say, describe the group's everlasting quest to glorify God. With the help of amazing harmonies, such as, To Him Who Sits On the Throne, Acappella scores another hit."
5,a wild & dangerous tale!,"Rebeccasreads highly recommends SOULS OF THE NORTH WIND as a wild & beautiful tale of a wild & dangerous time & place - it's history, legends & lores, with touches of science fiction, paleontology & archaeology.SOULS OF THE NORTH WIND is a coming of age tale of the Ihalmiut people, hunters & gatherers in Canada's northern tundra, who are ruled by superstitions, traditions & a new danger, some say from the supernatural world, that's haunting the land.With acknowledgements of the assistance the venerable Farley Mowat gave her & a modernday emphasis on understanding the shifting patterns of the environment, Chrissy McVay has captured the ancient ways of thinking & geared her language to readers aged 10-14, especially boys."
1,FAIL - Wrong Item,"FAIL!!! I ordered a 6ft Firewire cable and instead received a 3ft Ethernet cable. Extremely annoying since 1) I already have a gazillion ethernet cables, 2) which are worth next to nothing, 3) cmple.com website has NO phone contact info. Never buy from this company... EVER!!!"
5,6 pin firewire cable,"Be aware of the configuration of your Firewire Cable needs. They come in several different sizes and configurations. This cable met my needs perfectly, at a fair price, and that's all I ask for when making any purchase. Thanks Micro."
1,NOT like the picture shows,"the picture shows a gold plated quality cable. this one came 1. not gold plated 2. not a good quality cableIn fact, it didn't even work as a substitute for my current cable. I am mad i payed 5 bucks including shipping for this.. definitely not worth it. the first one i bought was 3 and actually worked, i got this one as a substitute since it appeared gold plated.What a piece of..... (you name it) How does this get such good reviews?"
1,"Received cheap, generic, defective cable","The product photo depicts a gold plated, HP fire wire cable. By description I expected to receive a quality HP product. Instead, I received a generic, low cost cable that had damaged pins and was defective. It was NOT gold plated. It was NOT labeled as a HP cable. I had no signal connection from my camera to computer. The cable I received is NOT what is described and pictured!!! Lesson learned... You get what you pay for."
3,okay dispenser,The only problem I have with it is that they use a red zip tie for you to hang it on your bag or leash.
3,handy. poor attachment design,"Nice to have pup take along his own little baggies.My issue is with the fastener , it's a zip tie, not reusable. I mean really, how many cents would it cost to use a little metal clip?"
4,"Flawed zip-tie design, but otherwise super handy!","We got this so we weren't ""those people"" in the neighborhood who leave their dog's poo in other people's yards and on the sidewalk. I love that the bags are bio-degradable and just the right size for picking up poo rather than using plastic grocery bags that you have to stuff in your pockets. The only thing I hated right from the start is that you have to secure it to your leash handle with a zip tie through a tiny opening at the top. They only give you 1 extra zip tie. I tried securing it to my leash handle, but then I kept bonking my dog in the head when I leaned down to adjust her collar or leash. I cut it off as soon as I got home, and my husband and I decided to connect the dispenser (with the extra zip tie) to a caribiner that we can clip to the leash handle, belt loop, or somewhere else on our clothing. It works perfectly for us and think this is a real handy little bag dispenser."
5,Life saver on Doggy walks!,"I was having bad luck using grocery store bags to pick up ""deposits"" left by my two Labs when we were out for our walks around town. The bags either had holes or were too thin (you know what happens then), or blew out of my pocket.Then I heard of Bags on Board! These are fantastic! They fit inside a small ""hydrant"", which I can attach easily to my dog's leash, and they don't blow away. I have yet to have a bag fail, and I'm on my 4th roll!They are big enough for ""Lab Size Deposits"", yet small enough to carry (once filled) home.Plus, they are cute! I've had a few people ask what it is. It's a ""Cool Idea"" THANKS!"
5,One for every leash in the house...,"It seems kind of silly to buy bags when you can use grocery bags and whatnot, but these are SO convenient. You never have to think about grabbing a bag (or worry about forgetting to grab a bag) before you leave the house. We have one on every leash we use."
5,Bags on Board Dispenser,Very handy product for those who like to take their dogs on walks around the neighborhood.
3,"Eh, OK","Um, I wish I hadn't bought this radio.It is larger than expected. It is too big for the pocket. Well, it would fit but then the lock would have to be used so the buttons didn't get pushed and then the stations cannot be changed.If you want a clip you have to put the radio into this cheesy plastic thing that has a clip. It looks super cheap and not what was expected for a Sangean. That clip was a hassle to use so it was gone in a minute.I bought this radio hoping for one that was more convenient to wear at the desk and walking around and on walks without thinking about the radio.CONs:It takes two button pushes to change the station to your next PREset. What?!I thought it would be smaller than it is so read the dimensions closely.No built in clip.I have two other Sangean radios that I love. Oh well."
1,Poor reception,Don't waste your money on this radio. It may look good in the picture but the real thing is made of cheap-feeling plastic with the color painted on. The FM reception is overall noisy for the price. The AM is basically useless - it can hardly pick up any station. Even my free promotional gift radio does a better job receiving AM broadcast.
1,Very Dissapointed!!,"I thought this would be an excellent radio because of the priceand other reviews, but it turned out to be horrible. It makes a terrible hissing noise that never goes away when it is on. Even when the volume is turned all the way down it still makes the sound."
1,save your money,"save your money and buy another brand. the ear buds are giant, reception both am/fm is poor. battery life is 2 hours! this is by far the worst portable radio i've used! going to buy the sony s2 sports walkman, comes with velcro arm band (had no problems with that radio in the past)"
2,Disappointed,"All I wanted was an FM receiver as good s the one in my iPod Nano. This one isn't even close. I can get a clear station only by turning off the stereo, and still in ome places interference from one station will overwhelm my chosen station."
1,Poor Reception,"Reviewer ""John T. Fisher ""Barefoot Skier"" hit it square on the head, and I wish had read his review and a few others before purchasing. I will add my $.02..I live in the NYC metro area with several strong FM stations, and virtually all of them came in poorly. I also listen to talk radio so the AM band is important. However, I could not get one station to come in clearly. The plastic volume control wheel looks like something from the 70's...even my free cell phone has digital controls. Control placement and labeling is a bit awkward and unintuitive. Ear buds were heavy and uncomfortable. It's going back to Amazon today...disappointed.I run and ride a bike a lot, so if anyone has a suggestion for a replacement, it would be much appreciated!"
2,Note: no speaker here,"This item is a 'receiver', not a radio. There is no external speaker; the only way to listen to it is with the ear buds. It's cute and small, but I needed a speaker. So back it goes while I search for a small radio with a speaker."
4,Great commuter radio,Excellent size for commuting. Great sound quality and electronic tuner is very convient. Earbuds are not real comfortable but then you don't have to mess with foam covers falling off like some others. Vinyl cover kills reception... throw it out and you'll be a lot happier with the perfomance of the radio.
5,"super longevity, great range","I have this radio, with the Radio Shack label, which I bought at least 8 years ago. I am a retired long-haul trucker and used this radio on the road because the in-dash radio in a Freightliner has no ground plane for AM antennas. I was able to receive KOA in Denver from the Chicago area at night, and ABC in New York from the Ohio Turnpike. I am ordering another because the case is badly scuffed from years of hard use and the case is loose. Battery life is excellent, with rechargeable batteries lasting up to 3 and 4 weeks per charge using the radio for 6 to 8 hours a day.I currently use this radio for covert listening to talk radio which my wife finds offensive. How can EIB offend anyone??"
2,Sangean DT-110 Digital Pocket AM/FM Stereo Receiver,Quality of radio is ok. The ear pieces are large and uncomfortable in the ear. I listen to the radio while I work at my office job. This thing eats batteries. I have now gone to rechargeable batteries hoping this will help keep me in the music. I do like the auto cut off after 90 minutes. The low battery function is annoying as the sound will come out for approximately 1 minute then shut off. Would suggest a better clip case than the cheap vinyl and a better earphone size.
2,AM Reception - not so good,"I like this radio - except that the only reason to pay so much for a portable radio - AM reception is not so good.I had a Sangean DT200V AM/FM/TV Portable Pocket-Size Radio which I liked - except that, when I dropped it, it broke.Since this radio was advertized as having good reception and becuase I liked the DT200V, and didn't need the TV reception or the built in speaker, I thought this one would be good. It would be lighter and possibly less breakable as it uses lighter batteries and doesn't have a built in speaker.I like the features (I like the setting for three favorites) and I like the locking feature and the 90 minute automatic turn off. However, the AM reception isn't so good. It often has backround noise and is not as good as the DT200V - sometimes almost unlistenable. Any cheap radio will have adequate FM reception so AM reception was the whole reason I bought this radio - so I'm disappointed."
1,Disappointed,"I have bought many small radios over the years, including others by Sangean. I was very disappointed with this one. It looks cheap, feels cheap, and has mediocre sound. For the price, I was expecting better. I know I could have bought a much nicer radio for less money."
4,Fine Performance and Smooth Styling,"The DT-110 provides excellent sound in a compact radio. I need something for the gym and the DT-110 provides easy tuning and a ggod bass emphasis. The range could be better. When I go to the far corner of the work-out room, even local stations are plagued by static. Also, the earphones are not well-designed. The cord is too short, and the ear buds tend to come loose and fall out during vigorous exercise. The automatic tuning is easy to set and to change stations. The styling is minimalist and has drawn compliments."
4,fun story quick read,"fun quick paced story easy to read. like millennium man and stepford wives in a fantasy of the future consuming the past. fun characters, I only which it had been told as a longer story so I could get lost in the book."
1,Whats pictured is Not what I recieved!,The item pictured has a bendable center joint. What I recieved is solid and does Not bend! Whats up with that!!
5,"Una maravilla, A jewel...","Este disco me echo bilongo..como dicen en Cuban...a must buy como dice en USA. Sin lugar a duda uno de los mejores CDs de la temporada, certainly the best I bought this year...Es imposible escuchar este disco sin querer bailar. Vivito y Coleano cannot be recommended enough."
4,Pleasantly surprised,Purchased this as a gift for my husband. The quality exceeded his expectations - has a nice finish and hardware. Seems to be pretty solid. Good color match to the Crosley stereo he owns. Easy to assemble.
2,Was shipped very fast,Was shipped very fast but the door is put together with tiny screws and the magnetic strip to hold the door together doesn't really grasp. If you buy this you will need a super small screwdriver to put it together and a normal size one. Also the back is made of fiber board and not real wood. Looks nice from the outside though but a pain to put together.
2,entertainment center returned,I was disappointed with the return policy. I returned it because it needed someone to put it together and I didn't have anyone here to do that. I never took it out of the box and yet when I returned it I got an email back saying I only got half off of it. I could see if it was opened or I had awhile but I didn't. I only had it until I was able to send it back. I did want it but if things need putting together then they are useless to me. Sandy.
2,Crosley ST75 Bardstown Entertainment Center Stand,"I haven't taken it out of the box completely yet, but so far I'm disappointed. Inside the box is a bunch of boards, -it's not put together at all, -apparently I have to build it myself with the supplies in the box."
2,OK considering price is pretty cheap,"It's a very nice looking piece. Arrived quickly in good condition. Can be put together with only one or two tools. Problem is, it's not so easy to put together, definitely need two people. One side kept popping out while I was sliding the back into its grooves. The door is put on with 8 very, very tiny screws and someone has to hold the door in place while another is screwing it on. While I was putting it together (and I was being very careful) two small pieces of the finish chipped off, one on the side and one on the bottom edge. The finish in those areas is awfully thin. The finishes on the door and top are much stronger. It looks really nice with the Crosley turntable/CD recorder, holds a lot of albums but is not good for CD storage. For $88 though, I'm happy enough with it.Crosley 4-in-1 Music System - Paprika (CR66-PA)Crosley CR248 Songwriter CD Recorder - Paprika"
2,Crosley poor quality,"I received this item promply. I started to put it together, and had missing hardware, and defective parts.I phoned Crosley, and odered the parts that I needed, but they never came. I ordered them again, and they got here twelve days later.The poor workmanship, plus poor customer service from Crosley, from the time that I made my order, to the time it took to get enough, and good parts here, I finally got my item put together, and useable in about 40 days. I will never order another Crosley item."
5,Excellent product!,"After the order was placed, the product arrived incredibly fast which was terrific since it was part of my son's college graduation present! It certainly met my son's expectations. It was easy to assemble; the finished product looks very nice matching his phonograph perfectly."
4,Crosley Bardstown entertainment Center Stand Cherry,This was a nice stand at a good price. The only problem i had with it is the instructions. You have to use your imagination and common sense on this stand because the instructions are not very well written out. I was missing a couple of screws too. Be careful and don't put screws in farther than they are supposed to go because they are thicker than the wood and will go through to the other side!
3,Looks Good But...,"This table looks good. Shows well. However, it arrived damaged. It looks as if someone assembled it and then disassembled it prior to shipping. I still own this table, but if I could do it over again, I would go with another brand."
2,Poor quality,***objects are smaller than they appear**. Did not like the quality of the wood or the size of the stand.
2,crosley entertainmnet stand,"I was looking for a cabinet to match the crosley entertainment box I recieved for Christmas and thought this unit looked like what I was looking for. The color was fine, however putting it together took longer than I expected and once I got it together I thought it was quite wobbly. In fact I have not yet put the crosley system on top because I am concerned about how strong the unit really is. All parts were in the box however there was some damage to the side panel. If I could return it I would but the aggrivation and expense in doing so would not be worth it. If I had this to do over I would have been better off seeing the unit in person and checking its sturdiness."
3,"It really is just ""OK""",It's a nice stand and it's attractive. I like that it is made from real wood and not particle board. It's semi-sturdy but I wouldn't put anything other than the record player on it. The door doesn't shut very well as the magnet has no real strength. I think in the coming years the whole piece will loosen and it will eventually have to be trashed but for now it's a nice addition to our living room and is getting put to good use.
2,Assembly not easy,"I recently purchased the Crosley stand and was excited about my purchase until I tried putting it together. It is extremely difficult and it comes in a million pieces. I called the help line so they can walk you through the assembly process. It was useless to me because you can only reach them during the week, up until a certain time.. I spent my time talking to a person on the job, while at work. It's pointless when you don't have the product in front of you. I think it should be indicated that there is a large amount of assembly required. For the price I paid, it should have come put together.I still have it sitting in a box in my living room."
2,Was not the size as viewed,I bought this to go with the nostalgic record player I bought and they showed this one to purchase with it. It is barely wide enough to hold the player and in assembling it to return would be too much of a hassle. It actually is nice just small.
2,COLOR,THE COLOR OF THIS PRODUCT IS NOT AND OAK COLOR. WE LIKE THE CABINET...WE WOULD HAVE SELECTED A DIFFERENT COLOR..
3,Misleading material information,"This item was advertised as ""Constructed of hardwoods and veneers"" It appears to me that it is mostly MDF or something similar. It also had 2 dime sized scuffs on the top that were not caused by shipping the item. The oak stain is very yellow. It is easy to assemble. I will be returning it and will request reimbursement for the return shipping costs."
3,"Too much Fluff, where's the gritt.","Although this is a good overview of Steven Spielberg's work it lacks any real in depth analysis. It's not really that much better than a promo vehicle for Steven Spielberg.Watchable, informative but ultimately a bit disapionting.Cam:)"
2,Greatly Disappointed,"I purchased this video after reading the great reviews online. However, I found the video a great disappointment. If you are looking for a video that presents instruction on fundamental techniques for youth baseball, then this is not the video to buy. There is absolutely no description of technique, just a presentation of disjointed ""drills"" often without a clear explanation of what is accomplished with the drill. In fact, some of the infield drills that are supposed to develop speed and coordination, will encourage sloppy technique. This video is not even close to the quality of the Emanski videos."
5,I should have bought this a year ago...,"My weakness as a coach is having an effective practice with different drills. I can say that after watching this video I am excited about next season, I just wish I would have discovered this before my last season. This video could not come more recommended for drill ideas in every aspect of the game. I also bought Marty Schupak's Youth Baseball Drills book as a companion. Marty is my new hero."
4,Baseball Instruction: Superior Baseball Drills For Skills Building & Fun!,"You see, you spend a good piece of your life gripping a baseball,and in the end it turns out that it was the other way around all the time.~Jim Bouton, Ball Four,This DVD ""grips"" you like baseball does. Your practices will not only begood for fundamental skills but your team will enjoy them. No doubt after a day at workand commuting home, leading a Little League team of 10, 11 and 12 year olds ina practice can seem like a chore. This program will simplify youth baseballand put some fun into your practices for you (the coach) also.Marty Schupak also produced these popular DVDs available on Amazon.Baseball Coaching:Hitting Drills & TechniquesFor Little League coaches & parents.Soccer Coaching:Championship Soccer DrillsFor soccer coaches & parents.Basketball Coaching:48 Championship Basketball DrillsFor youth & school basketball coaches & parents."
5,Great Buy!,I've seen a number of instructional videos and this is excellent. There are about 30 drills with a diagram (great touch) to show placement of the players. The narrator explains each drill while a crew of Little Leaguers demonstrates the drill. I used most of the drills and they work pretty well.
5,simple & Complete!,Excellent in it's simplicity! Creative and fun! Could have used more technical instruction but good buy for the buck!
5,Real help for little league and/or youth softball educators,This video will help even the worst players on the team. My personal advice to coaches that have kids that just cannot get a feel for playing ball is to hide them behind home plate. Let them each take an inning or 2 there. This way they can learn to catch and throw and the team still has a chance of winning. This is a great video. I highly reccomend it.*****
2,Copic Markers,"The Copic Markers I purchased were not the same color markers as appear in the ad. Plus, I felt like I got the ""run-around"" from the sellers - as it took around a month to receive them. I was told they would ship one day and another day - and both were incorrect information."
4,very amusing,"I just got this book but I haven't quite finished it yet, but as of right now I am very pleased with it's humorous content. The text is unusual in some instances but all around it is pretty well put together. This is certainly a book I will treausre, and I've yet to check out the glow in the dark stains but I can't wait to. Granted, some of the pictures leave a little to be desired, but has anyone ever been perfect all the time? no, so it is unfair to expect this from anyone. But anyhow, this book has unmistakably been enjoyable and as with all of Frouds books, I'll be rereading this one sometime in the near future, and if a book is good enough to be reread then it's a keeper!"
4,Not Enough to Such a cute book!,"I bought this book to have an interesting coffee table book for a bit of light reading and while I thought the content was funny and kinda cute, there was simply not enough of it. It does make for an interesting conversation piece however."
2,NASTY HUMOR,"I PICKED UP THIS BOOK SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF A SCANT FEW OF BRIAN FROUDS BOOKS STILL IN PRINT. I CAN'T HELP REGRETTING THAT A LITTLE. BRIAN FROUD IS A WONDERFUL ARTIST, AND TERRY JONES CAN BE FUNNY SOMETIMES, BUT I GET THE FEELING THIS BOOK WAS RUSHED ONTO SHELVES SIMPLY TO CAPITALIZE ON THE POPULARITY OF THE PRESSED FAIRY BOOK. IT IS LITERALLY SATURATED WITH BATHROOM HUMOR: AMONG THE CREATURES THEY INTERVIEW ARE FARTS, VOMIT, AND URINE STAINS. EVEN FROUD'S ART, WHICH IS SURE TO INTICE PEOPLE WHO WON'T EVEN READ THE TEXT, SEEMS RUSHED AND CHEAP. MANY CHARACTERS ARE SHAPELESS GLOBS, AND MANY INTERPRETATIONS OF THE SAME CHARACTERS KEEP POPPING UP. IT IS SALVAGABLE BUY SOME FUNNY IDEAS (ONE STAIN THINKS IT IS GROUCHO MARX) AND LINES (""FROUD TOOK SEVERAL BLOWS TO THE BRAIN WHICH FORTUNATELY HAD NO AFFECT"" SOMETHING LIKE THAT. STILL, IT PROBABLY WON'T ENDERE ITSELF TO ANYONE BUT FROUD FANS, AND EVEN THEN IT WILL PROBABLY BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THERE LISTS."
5,"Great Book, Great Group of Books by this Author","While reading children's books by this author to my kids, even as an adult I have been thoroughly entertained by the quirky adventures and was always excited when anticipating reading the next book in the ""If You Give a..."" group."
4,We loved it!,"My daughter likes all of the ""if you give a ...."" books, so this was a good deal and the book was in great condition."
5,Excellent children's book,"I had this book growing up and absolutely LOVED it! It has everything a children's book needs: funny story line, interesting characters and wonderful illustrations. I would recommend it for anyone's kid as a bedtime story, or for a child who is starting to read."
5,If You Give A Kid An Idea,"The kids and I just love the Numeroff books, and ""Moose"" in particular. It shows cause and effect, however absurd, and is full of activities for rainy or snowy days. The text and pictures have given us great ideas--sock puppets, making scenery, working in the garden, making jam, and cleaning up afterward. Highly recommended for encouraging young imaginations!"
3,"Moose, Muffin, from Melanie","If You Give a Moose a Muffin is a childrens story recommended for ages 5-7Like the classic If You give a Mouse a Cookie, it starts out with a little boy giving a muffin to a moose who just happens to be right outside his house, and then the moose asks for more and more stuff, such as blackberry jam, socks, sweaters, and one or two more muffins. All persons over the age of 7 probably will NOT find this read particularly enjoyable unless reading to a younger child."
3,Well it's the right book,"I have always liked this book and after ""If You Give A Pig A Pancake"" was a hit I just had to oder it. The only problem is I somehow missed that it was poster sized! I'm not sure where I will store it and it's not really what I wanted but I think my kiddo will like it so I think I'll keep it."
2,Moose a Muffin book,One of those books that just didn't grab or keep my attention. My granddaughter loves books and she is not a fan.
2,Ridiculously Big in Size,I didn't pay close enough attention when at least one other reviewer said this is too big! It is 15X17 inches. I can't store it with my other books. It doesn't fit on a bookshelf or in a credenza. Guess we'll have to slide it under the bed. I paid $20.74 just a couple days ago. It's 18.99 today. It's a cute story but not worth the price and inconvenience of the size.
3,"A harsh, but valuable lesson.","If you give a moose a muffin...you won't get it back again. And there's a risk you'll be gored to death in the moose's quest for more sugary snacks.It's not a nice lesson for children, but like ""don't accept lifts with strangers"", ""drugs are bad"" and ""just say no to S Club Juniors"", it's a lesson that has to be learned.Invaluable."
1,If you give a moose a muffin book,"This particular book is HUGE - like 24 inches by 30 inches. Too large to be handy to read or store...story is a good one, but book size - no way."
5,great book... so entertaining,arrived quickly and in great shape.Adorable storyline. Children from 2 to 102 will enjoy the irony and humor of the book. I haven't given it to my 7 year old granddaughter for Christmas yet but I feel certain she will think it is sooo funny. I am very pleased with the purchase.
5,Grandchildren loved it!,My daughter wrote me to tell me that the grandchildren made her read this book three times in a row and that my youngest grandson fell asleep holding the book! She said that they loved it--and that they laughed and laughed! High praise for any book!
5,Numeroff + Bond = Awesome team!,"BOTTOM LINE:Cannot recall in recent memory an author and illustrator that made such hilarious children's books! Numeroff's characters breathe life into a normal child's day a'la 'Cat in the hat' - causing situations that range from silly to sometimes bordering on the bizarre! The results are always hilarious and always come full circle. Overall, these books are fun to read, fun to look at, and just pure, magical whimsy.Love that."
3,ITS TOO BIG!!,"Having read this book to my children a million times as a child, I wanted to get it for a friend who is having their first baby.I was SHOCKED when I opened the HUGE box from Amazon. I mean this childrens book is nearly 18 inches long! It's GInormous!But, the content is great.Just never thought of having a lifesize muffin to read about."
3,It's okay,"My son really enjoyed ""If you Give a Pig a Pancake"" and we hoped this would flow as well, but it does not. It isn't horrible, but there are better ones in the series."
3,Doll ?,"I was very happy to get the package so early, but disappointed when I discovered that it was not the Barbie doll I order it was accessories. It would help if the description would have said ""doll sold separately"""
4,Very pretty,"The dishes arrived safely & as advertised. I like the square shape, esp. of the soup bowls. Too bad this shape is twice the price of the older, round Corelle patterns. I purchased them as a Christmas gift, so can't say how they will hold up. Altho I did run them thru the dishwasher & re-packed so they can be used when opened, & they did fine."
4,square not round,I used to have corelle long time ago. I bought it through my brother who studied in US. It was the round plate. Today I realized corelle produce a square dinner sets which makes it different from the conventional kitchenware. I love to have one as I am corelle lovers. So I decided to buy this pretty pink set. My sons also love this type of plates as it is different from the conventional dinner set we had. I am thinking to have another set as I have a big family more than 4 person.
5,Dish Set,"I love everything about this set, the size, the shape of each of the pieces. The design is very cute!"
4,I really liked it,"I have to say that the color is fine with me, compared to other people who disliked the quality. My only disappointment is the way it was shipped. It was packed badly and I received it with one dish shattered. But other than that I really liked the product."
5,Great for Summer Dining,"Tired of melamine, I ordered a set of Corelle Pretty Pink for outdoor dining two years ago. These dishes have worked beautifully. They are diswasher safe and almost unbreakable, so I never worry about dropping them on our patio floor. In addition, they are far more attractive and long lasting than melamine and plastic table ware. Just ordered a second set."
5,Love these dishes!!! Great value and design!,"I received two sets of these dishes from my wedding registry, and have been using them for a month. I love, love, love them!!! They are lightweight, and I love the pretty design. One thing to note - the dinner plates are really big. We usually use the small plates for meals. Also, the mugs are made of ceramic, which is a different material than the plates and bowls. Also, the mugs are made in China, whereas the rest of the pieces are made in the USA.I have not dropped any plates yet, so I can't attest to their unbreakability. However, they have not chipped or cracked, and I've not had any issues with the colors fading. I think this is a great value, and I'm very pleased with these dishes!"
3,DISAPOINTED,"Following the advice of a fellow reviewer I went to my local store, and got 2 sets of this pattern. I got home and opened the box only to find disapointment. The pattern looks less bright in person, and it just doesn't look right on the smooth plate. The mugs looked ok, but I'm not keeping this because I like the mugs so so. If the people of corelle though brighter colors would look better on their products (like on the box picture, wich is oubviously fixed) why not just go ahead and do it like that? another question is, Why can't they make vitrelle cups and mugs????? this really gets me, because my mom, who lives overseas in South America, has a set of the same material, different brand, and she has cups AND mugs made of vitrelle also. So it isn't impossible to make this cups.The 3 stars are for the plates and bowls shapes, light wheight, stackability, ang for the mugs, which are pretty."
3,(just) acceptable,"the grades I give for the 5 aquarium types are:Classic: close-up 4 stars, wide 3 stars; Freshwater: close-up 3-4 stars, wide 2-3 stars; Coral Reef: close-up 4 stars, wide 2 stars; Natural: close-up 2-3 stars, wide 1-2 stars; Exotic: close-up 2-3 stars, wide 0-1 starThe playing time (of each aquarium) of close-ups is 7-8 minutes (should've been longer). The wide shots playing time is 25-27 minutes on cd 1 (classic, coral reef, natural) and 40 minutes on cd 2 (exotic, freshwater).The classic and freshwater aquaria are nice enough to look at in the wide shots, also because of the background but the other aquaria aren't really examples of fine composition in that area.Background music/noise choices: not too bad.A third cd, more time for the close-ups and more attention for aquarium composition would've made this collection (a lot) better !"
1,AQUARIA IS AWFUL. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!,"I just received and watched 'Aquaria' and am astounded that these people see fit to charge money for this trash!!! I recently had a high-end 50"" plasma / surround sound system installed and I thought Aquaria would be something like the impressive aquatic computer generated screen savers available today. What did I get? Some lousey, low-end video (no, not even filmed) of murkey fishtanks. Total ripoff!!! You'll have more fun watching wet towels dry. I would have given it no stars had it been an option!"
1,"Bad Quality, Very Disappointing","I could have done better with my home camcorder. I was hoping this would show off my new HDTV, but delivers a VCR quality picture. Highly recommend you look elsewhere."
3,Ok for what it is...,"I was hoping this DVD would be a lot more enjoyable than it is. I don't know why, but it just doesn't impress me. The picture quality is good, but it's a DVD so it should be. Other than that there's not much of interest. Maybe the fish were having an off day when they were filmed? I found the music tracks (""Meditation"" and ""Relaxation"") rather annoying. The sound effects tracks are ok, but the ""Bubbles"" soundtrack doesn't sound like a fish tank to me...it's too busy and too noisy. The setup that I like the most (or dislike the least) is the Classic tank with the Bubbles soundtrack. That seems to be the closest to having a real tank in your living room. If you are really serious about getting into the world of fish, then get a real tank. If you really want to learn about fish then buy a book. If you just want a mildly entertaining maintenance free fish tank in your living room then get this DVD."
1,Aquaria The Freshwater Aquarium,"What a waste of time, money and effort! This must be the worst screensaver ever made! It looks like the screensaver was made by an 8 year old kid with a very cheap and old camcorder! Rarely in focus; this screensaver is just plain junk. I really don't know how this ended up on the retail market! Don't buy this one!"
3,How comes 15 hours video?,"I have bought it. For full tank view, I give 2 stars. The fish tank is too large to present details in DVD resolution. For close-up view, it is my favorite and I give it 4 stars. The play of close-up view is rather short and sometimes out of focus. The last thing I want to mention is there are 5 fish tanks. Each provides 1 hour full screen and 15 minutes close-up playback. I don't know how comes the 15 hours video playback as mentioned at the back of the box!"
1,Amazingly Bad,You would have a more usable product if you were to film a friend's fish tank with your IPhone. The colors are washed out and the quality is just above VHS. I'm glad I only spent a few dollars on this DVD because that's definitely all it's worth.
1,A Plain Fish Bowl Would Have Been Better,"This is the worst attempt of an aquarium I have ever seen. Having a plain fish bowl with one fish would have been better. Basicaly the camera stays in one spot, with may be 2 fish to look at, and they barely move around. Then to make it worst the background is void of any color, its just gray and horrible. I got my DVD and through it into the trash. If I had a fire place I would have burned it! This DVD is only worth .99 cents at the .99 cent store."
2,"Difficult ""Watchers"" Aquarium","I am disappointed in Aquaria's The Coral Reef Aquarium in that the background lacks color and all the fish are small varieties, but those with fish know-how would probably find the setting ""correct"" and some aspects, swaying coral and little creatures would be interesting in a zoomed view.But I highly recommend Aquaria's Natural Aquarium. Lot's of color and diversity in the background and colorful fish of all shapes and sizes for those of us just wanting an aquarium. I like the sound tracks, but are they the same on all the ""Aquariums""? Strange.Big ""thumbs up"" for the ""Natural Aquarium"", but down for ""The Coral Reef"", unless you know what to expect."
4,Numb Butt,"I used to get a numb butt when I went kayaking, but since I've gotten this it hasn't been as bad. I won't pretend that it still doesn't happen, but it takes a lot longer than initially. Although, maybe I'm just getting use to sitting in the kayak more ;-) I would rather not find out. I just know it seems to have helped me."
2,Not alot of comfort,"Disappointed in this product. I thought that it would add some comfort. It really doesn't do much - not alot of padding on this cushion. I wouldn't even call it a cushion. it is more like a thin pad. If you are looking for cushion I wouldn't buy it. If you are looking to keep dry and that is all, it does provide barrier for any water that ends up on the seat, but that is about the only good point. Really disappointed...."
4,Works for me,I have suffered with sciatic nerve pain for the past few years when I'm sitting in a kayak and decided to try the Skwoosh cushion. At first it didn't seem to be working but after about 30 minutes it was a huge improvement.
3,Kayak confort pad,"I bought this to help me out during my recovery from prostate cancer surgery, but it did not help enough by itself. I expect to use it while kayaking when i recover to do that."
1,undectable odor,i was unable to rid the item of an odor. everyone has been very helpful and i am now awaiting ups to pick up item for a return thank you lois a simpsom
1,I'm very dissapointed,"There are only snippets of usefull and interesting information, the videos suddenly stop. The ""digital soundtrack"" sounds horrible - never play classical music on a synthesizer! A new age soundtrek would've been much better. All in all I find this product superficial and incomplete. I'm sorry but I would't recomend this tittle."
1,"there is nothing ""romantic"" about this book","I was very disappointed with this story. Not only was it not romantic in any way, but the end was terrible. I like books where the good ones come out on top and the bad ones get what's coming to them. If that is what you like, avoid this book!"
2,bread oven builders,had expected much more about building the ovenin fact only describes the very simple design of fireplace integrated as ovenbit disappointed with the description at this book
2,Missing Plans?,The authors make several references to a set of plans and list of materials that are included with this book but these appear to be missing. I would not try to build a masonry oven with this book but it is a good start.
5,The only book you'll ever need for cake decorating!,"Easy to follow instructions and tempting photographs for the beginner to expert cake decorator. Includes foolproof recipes for delicious cakes, many types of frostings, fondant, flower-making, borders, and more. Detailed step-by-step decorating instructions make it easy to create professional results at home. Excellent selection of delicious cake recipes with accompanying glazes, fillings, and decorating ideas. This is the most comprehensive book I have read on cake decorating. Tired of leafing through countless bookshelves for recipes, creative ideas, and decorating instructions? This book is for you. The Ultimate Cake Decorator has it all!"
1,It would not play on any of my machines.,"The DVD did not play at all. I bought it as one of my wife's Christmas presents and had to return it. Too bad, she likes these old movies."
3,Not the best quality,"A Boxer I was fostering demolished my original copy of Naughty Marietta and I wanted a replacement. Obviously a bit pricey, but it's good to have in a collection of classic movies. I was a bit disappointed when I first viewed the movie, since the quality was not the same as the one I orginally had. I'm still glad that I bought it, but disappointed in the quality."
2,not individual bags,Just thought I'd let people know that this is one long stream of plastic tubing. You need a pair of scissors to cut your bag and you need to tie a knot at the bottom. So this isn't the convenient diaper bag you want when you have a messy diaper in front of you and need to dispose of yucky stuff quickly.
5,"Beautiful, Sexy, Great for flying",AO has the perfect balance of shading your eyes from the sun without blocking instruments. I only fly in AO and these are the original. They also shipped very quickly
5,The best Mini Disc I've Seem,"The Sony Mz-R37 is easy to use and very portable. The buttons are easily accessible and the remotes editing functions make titling, deleting, moving tracks on the mini disc easy. The remote allows you to keep your mini disc in its case and still make use of track searching, stopping, and adjusting the volume. I do reccomend that you buy a cable with stereo mini jacks on both sides so you can record from devices that don't have the optical output. This will also allow you to record directly from a portable cd player. The player also includes recharble batteries that have good battery life and can be charged in the mini disc player usding the supplies power adaptor. I strongly recommend that you purchase this mini disc player from Amazon.com like I did. Amazon.com is $50 cheaper than Best Buy and even $100 cheaper than some other stores."
4,"Great mini disc, just got from amazon.com","I just got this mini disc player in and tried it out. I did have to go out and get some mini disc's but it is great. I just recorded wwf the music volume 4 to it and it works fine. At points, one speaker goes out for a sec. But that only happens once and I think the cd might be scratched. Great sound otherwise. I will hook my mic in and record some of my music once I get a new mic. Great system. This is the best price for this at 200. I have shopped around and 200 is the best I could find. I recomend getting it from amazon.com"
3,The good the bad and the minidisc...,"*Very versitile: Can record off of a cumputer, the radio, CD's, tapes, whatever. *Slim design makes it easy for me to bring along when I run. * Bad things: * The headphones it comes with has a very very very short cord (very unpractical). *I have had to get it fixed 3 times because the connection in the headphone jack. The sound becomes distorted and they have to sauder it (Not fun for someone who uses it everyday) *OH YEah MD's aren't supposed to skip..it does once in a while"
2,Informational but not very practical,"This book is good if you a looking for general explanation of the history of reflexology and the ways it can help to improve and maintain your health. However, there is appoloing lack of visual presentations to help you actually do it. I was very disappointing because I ordered this book as the first page seemed to promise exactly that - the book with lots of visuals aids. If you are like me and would like something very practical and visual do not waste your money. Except if you would like to receive free reflexology socks, which are excellent idea."
3,Average infomation content. Excellent Visual Aids,"This book was average on the subject matter. The pair of socks that had a diagnostic map located on the bottom of the feet was what attracted me to the book. However, it was not to the scale of my feet. Rather, it fit the scale of the book..My favorite books on reflexology is out of print and is called ""The Story the Feet Can Tell"""
2,Too Hippie New Age for Me,"I beleive that reflexology works, but this book is a little too far out there. Heavily focused on ""balancing"" and ""focusing"" and eastern practices. The socks are a fun little item. A chart of the pressure points would have been appreciated."
2,not enough,"I feel there isnt enough info you can look at that sells the book. show a picture, get the person to want to buy the book. need pictures, to show all that is in the index."
1,Do not buy this product,This PVC cutter is the worst tool I have ever owned. The cutter cannot make a straight cut. Tried every size and type of PVC pipe available. Clearly a design problem. Ended up finding replacement blade for my 30 year-old Victor PVC cutter and returning this piece of junk to Amazon.
4,Great,"This book is wonderful. It is fun to read, but you have to get into a rhythym and use a slight drawl. My kids love it. We've gotten it so many times from the library that it's time to get our own copy."
3,a regular flood of mishap,I found this book funny. Its about a girl that causes tons of problems and decides to run away. It has good coloring and drawings. What is said in the end I think is very true. So read the book to find out what happens. Do it!Mark C
3,"Cheap, but interesting",I bought this DVD at my local Grocery store. It was marked down to $2 and I decided to get it. It isn't worth much more than that. Yu-Gi-Oh fans should look elsewhere.
5,Excellent!,"From Back Cover:Diaz's debut recording has the self-assured unassuming character of a natural merginig of past and present. Diaz's study of jazz and classical idioms and affinity for contemporary harmony and technology are evident throughout, and put a unique stamp on his particular expression of the Argentine sound."
5,Wonderful look at showbiz problem solver,"I loved this part-biography, part how-to-succeed in the entertainment industry. Bill Carter, who worked with the Rolling Stones and Reba McEntire and worked on research for the Warren Commission's investigation into President Kennedy's assassination, is one guy you would want on your side if you were ever in a fix.The best chapters describe how Carter was able to keep Keith Richards out of jail in Canada and how he negotiated the release of Steve McQueen's body in Mexico. This is a real behind-the-scenes look from an insider's perspective, one that isn't gossipy but very instructional on how to handle people.Everyone should have a Bill Carter on their side. If that's not possible, they can at least get to know him through this book."
4,Get Carter,"This book was very intersting. We used it for our November book club discussion. One of the gals grew up with him. It was enlightening about all that this man did. He is a very intersting person, and talking to someone who new him added more. We got an autographed picture of him, too."
4,Does the job,I think this product does the job. I always find myself wishing it was soapier when I am using it but it gets the chlorine out of my suits so I can't complain too much
1,Not good for Fastskin,"After washing my daughter's Fastskin in this product as directed, I noticed a greenish-black tint to the water. I believe this product to have weakened and faded the material. The material still smelled like chlorine after washing. The directions say to rinse well after hand washing. This just introduces chlorine back into the garment via my faucet. A Fastskin is way too expensive to have another Speedo product ruin it. I am extremely displeased with this product."
2,Unsure,"I really do not know if this product works.The instuctions on the bottle are not specific enough so maybe I am doing something wrong. I did not find that my swimwear lasted any longer than when I have not used the product. I am into my second swinsuit in 9 months, so I do not believe that this is normal. I swim 5 days a week for 1 hour."
4,Label on bottle not as pictured,"Not a big deal, but most of the label on the product I received is a picture of a young woman in a swimsuit, not an easy-to-read label as is pictured here. Amazon should accurately depict the product. Just sayin'Seems to work OK, but need to soak the suit, not just give it a quick dip."
1,Did not take the yellow out!,"I had high hopes for this product, but it did not work at all. It is probably fine just to preserve your bathing suits, but do not expect much more."
5,Honees!,"I love these things - whenever I'm in NYC, I make a point of going to the one store I know that sells them and buying 5-6 packs for $1 apiece - now I can just order them in!"
5,Ate these as a kid,"These are the best candies made with real honey, and a chewy center. My mother used to buy these for me in the early 70's, and nthing has changed about them. im so glad i was able to find them. Every person I give them to, loves them. If your a honey lover, you'll love these."
1,shipping disaster,I ordered a box of regular honees and a box of the milk-n-honees. Well i got the regular honees fine but the milk ones came 4 weeks later (after I got another box of the regular ones and e-mailed the mistake).They were awful!!They werent stored right so they were chewey and the honey had crystalized.
1,Rip off brows,I already had purchased santa eye brows identical to these very phony looking for $6.00 these were more than twice that cost the problem is they are not even close to the picture at all they totally lied about the the eye brows they sell shame on them
5,Very excellent story,"You won't be disappointed in this book very exciting,lots of action and adventure, characters very likable, a love story for all time!!"
3,so-so.,started out interesting and never really got off the ground with romance or action. kept putting it down and going back hoping it would improve
3,Not her best work but still a good read,"This book is a testament to Adrians talent. The characters are well developed and the story is exciting, the romance seems appropriately paced and sweet. The female love interest is somewhat irritating at some points due to her naive nature, but is still a lovable character. the male lead is also somewhat stereotypically cold-hearted and troubled, but again makes a nice progression and development through the book. Being her first venture into paranormal romance (and the precursor to the midnight breed series) this book is a good jumping off place for the series and is a fun read."
4,"LOVED the adventure, but the romance was flat","I loved the adventure in this story. The quest to find the avossar cup was very exciting filled with mystery and ""shifters"" as they called them and hidden, magical places.The romance, however, was so dull and uninteresting I skipped through the ""heated"" love scenes and all that ""I love you SO much"" stuff. Ariana of Clairmont and Braedon were way to far apart in age for their attraction to each other to be taken seriously. That a man approaching middle age would be attracted to a beautiful 18 year old virgin is nothing new nor flattering. I would have been more into it if he was only a few short years older than her (like no more than about 5), like the main characters in her ""Lord of Vengeance"" book. I loved the action AND romance in that book.If it wasn't for the action and mystery surrounding the magical cup in this book I wouldn't have kept reading it.Well, I'm off now to see if book two in the series will be worth it. :)"
3,Uh... Must have read a different book...,"A historical with paranormal elements, and a h who was the most irritating creature. I think the story would have had more depth to it if it had been written from the H's perspective. Story was largely predictable. Not one of the author's better works."
3,"It was sweet but I think I""ll stick with the Midnight Series",Love Lara Adrian! Ive been reading her novels for years and this was no exception. A sweet book for sweet girls who believe in finding love in the just right amount of a damaged boy. Braedon was the perfect tortured bad boy and Arianna was the wholesome damsel in distress. Not really my cup of tea. This type of novel doesn't really excite me to read more because I can't relate to it but it doesnt make me love Laras' books any less. I will just look forward to hopefully some more Midnght Breed novels and will still follow and appreciate her books.
1,"DNF - story moved no where, repetitive and depressing","I could not finish this book. The same thing happened over and over.1. Characters are attacked2. Characters fight off attackers3. Characters run4. Repeat steps 1-3 over and overOh, and the whole time, its either rainings or snowing, cold, and dark.The so called Kedrick and his kidnapping was not enough motivation to continue reading it, and the relationship between the H/H was non existant. The Heroine was naive and irritating."
5,Heart of the Hunter,This is an Awesome book. I am a Big Fan of Lara Adrian and she always leaves me pleased with her writings :-)
2,Heart of the Hunter,"Adequate - could have been so much better....The ""changing into animals' is just not my idea of a way to show the powers of the bad guys...."
2,Meh,It was alright but not as strong as her Breed series. Don't think I will read the others until I have seen the reviews
3,Good writing marred by gratuitous sex,"The book has a promising beginning, with a good narrative, sense of pacing, and well developed characters, but the over-the-top, Twilight-esque way the lead female character swoons over the lead male, even though they've known each other for maybe a day, got on my nerves. Even so, I was willing to put up with it until about halfway through, when an EXTREMELY detailed sex scene pops up. After skimming through at least 5 pages, and seeing no end in sight, I gave up and put the book down. I'm not a prude, but I do have my standards. If a scene like this doesn't bug you, you will probably enjoy this book."
4,Good historical documentary,"I first saw this in a high school chemistry class, and was impressed at the footage and soundtrack. However, as it is a documentary it also needs historical information, which it does provide. Since it is a 92-minute film, it can't be too in-depth, but I feel that most of its appeal is strictly shock value and visual. That being said, it does have interviews with nuclear physicists involved in the R&D programs of these weapons, and focuses on both American and Russian atomic testing. The ending is a bit of a disappointment, because I would have liked to see more about China's nuclear programs. A bit of a cliffhanger :("
4,A Worth Watching Documentary of Earth's Most Feared Weapons,"As many customors rate it (obviously), this is a very fascinating film. 'Trinity and Beyond' is a worth watching documentary of Earth's most feared weapons: the atomic bombs, and the more destructive hydrogen bombs. Whether you love world history, or have interest to the nuclear weapons, or just want to fill some excitement in your living room, this is a film to watch.The documentary describes numerous kinds of nuclear bombs and displays the haunting, spectacular ignitions. Forget the special effects from fictional movies; these are genuine explosions which would loom the world. As an avid lover of classical and orchestral music, the cryptic, powerful background music composed by William Stromberg gives a perfect flow to the terrifying footages, some not ever released by public before.Overall, a very great film. Worth watching."
5,Excellent HD documentary,"If you like seeing things blow up in HD, this is for you. All the old Atomic/H-Bomb trials remastered in HD."
3,ATOMIC BOMBS!!!!!,"I've always been fascinated with the incredible power of nuclear explosions. This is a nice video that shows a lot of the early tests... the sudden blinding fireballs, the shockwaves destroying structures, the various mushroom cloud shapes. Horrifyingly beautiful and ""awe""ful in viewing. It is still hard to comprehend the amount of devastation that a nuke can deliver. And, no, all you wannabe terrorists, this does NOT show you how to build atomic weapons.This is a good video for anyone interested in the history of the most powerful WMD's on Earth."
1,Skip it.,"This DVD has poor production quality, with very little content worth watching. Borrow it from your local library to see for yourself. People giving good reviews are probably related to the seller."
4,Great video,"This DVD covers a series of atom bomb tests from 1945 to the signing of the atomic test ban treaty. Narrated by Bill Shatner and using theme music from the Moscow Philharmonic it conveys both the awesome power of the bomb and the mood of the times. On top of that, the DVD included 3D glasses and a 3D feature. This video would be fun for just about anyone."
2,"Beautiful, but totally dubious as documentary","I suppose most everyone will spot the bad taste that screams off the cover and choose to look past it if they are still curious. William Shatner's narration is adequate, I suppose, but the music, while technically accomplished would be more appropriate for fiction- some sort of awful action movie. The ""documentary"" consists of an obvious, superficial history with no intellectual or analytical distinction. Most bothersome is my suspicion that some of the footage has been colorized (black and white frames digitally duotoned, for instance) and accentuated (increased saturation, etc.). Make no mistake- the footage looks fabulous, and the film is an almost irresistable purchase. But don't expect it to tell you much, and don't trust its integrity."
3,"Good footage, laughable soundtrack","This movie had some very good footage of nuclear tests. It was rather skimpy on background on the scientific and military motivation for the tests. And the music soundtrack was LOL awful! (Although I guess that if you can't tell on your own that a multi-megaton nuclear blast is an awesome sight, then the overblown Wagnerian music could be useful to clue you in.)"
3,Frightening,I only give it three stars because the content re-creates the fear that I grew up with during the cold war. The video is however unsurpassed on the horrors of the nuclear age to which I have seen. It deserves five stars but shouldn't be viewed by the faint of heart or those prone to shooting up schools.
2,eh.,"If you're interested in seeing a bunch of bombs exploding and a chronology of the evolution of nuclear warheads, this movie is the one for you. Personally, I felt like i wanted more information. what did they ACTUALLY learn about radioactivity, it's effects on life, it's staying power, how it disperses through the atmosphere? what were some false assumptions they had while developing these weapons and how did their understanding change? There are so many interesting questions around nuclear weapons, I felt disappointed this movie just focused exclusively on, ""then they developed a 45 kiloton bomb and this is what it looked like blowing up. then they developed a 10 megaton bomb and this is what it looked like blowing up."" etc. etc. It got tiresome by the end."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"If you watch the History Channel, Discovery Channel, et al, you won't find anything of substance in this movie that you haven't seen on the aforementioned channels. I bought this solely for it's alleged ""recently declassifed footage"" and was grossly disappointed. ""Recently declassifed""? When? 1950? Save your money."
3,A visual history of Atomic tests.,"This is an excellent visual history of the development of nuclear weapons. The original test of 100 tons of TNT is shown, which is the comparison test for all nuclear tests and explosions. The color footage is spectacular of the various shots. I bought this film specifically for the atomic cannon test; Upshot Knothole, Grable."
4,Great Documentary,The footage is great and the subject scary. This documentary gives you the birth to the present history of the A-Bomb.
4,Baker shot rules!!!!!!!,"I enjoyed this documentary, though I hesitated to give it 5 stars purely based on the subject matter. Nope, not the worlds biggest fan of nukes. But it has some amazing footage and information, if not a few silly sound effects..(Goats making goat sounds while being vaporized, kinda...funny?) Shatner gives a good narrative as well.Some of the blasts look like ameobas forming or something. Lots to see here that you haven't seen before."
4,A very big stick,"This is a very well made documentry. One of the best in its class. Full of historic insight and great footage. The film mostly focuses on the technical side of things. There was no footage of fallout shelters. The directors track gave a good insight in to the film. A lot of work went in to this DVD. If you have any intrest in this subject, this is well worth watching. Good extras."
3,Leaves you wanting more...,"This is more of a documentary more than a bomb movie. Specifically, it highlights all of the nuclear tests and there were some very interesting moments such as the craters and deep water explosions. But it failed to deliver a solid ending. There is absolutely no plot. Sure there was talk about nuclear test bans, treaties, and even the Chinese tests at the end of the movie, but it was like an essay paper with no main point."
3,Mediocre 3D,"The movie in itself was great, however, I was extremely disappointed with the 3D scenes. They weren't really three-dimensional at all, in fact, the commentary and a yucca plant were the only three-dimension scenes I witnessed. The 3D explosions was one of the major reasons I chose this DVD over others, and now all I'm left with is a useless pair of 3D glasses and a DVD no better than the rest."
5,Journal of Rehabilitation,A useful professional journal for clinicians working in rehab settings. I highly recommend this publication.
4,"Intrigue, journalism and social issues in Québec","Scoop is a Québécois television series from the early 1990s. It stars some currently well-known Canadian actors including Remy Girard (Le Déclin d'Empire Americain et Les Invasions Barbare) and Roy Dupuis (Nikita et Un Homme et Son Péché). It's a little strange to see both men so much younger, but at the same time comforting. Scoop looks at the lives of a number of journalists and the stories that they report for a daily newspaper. Each journalist wants the coveted spot on page one above the fold, each one wants to get the story right, but this is not an easy task. In addition there is quite a steamy love affair between two reporters. This is Québéc TV so scenes can be more explicit than some viewers maybe used to seeing. Overall, I enjoyed the show, however, I can very much see where Scoop could easily make the transition from evening television drama to evening soap opera. We'll have to see what seasons 2-4 bring."
1,Dry and impossible to read,"It is more like a monologue than a well-organized textbook. The author spent way too many pages in glory details of ER modeling and EER modeling. You might think that it can serve as a good reference book. Wrong! It is impossible to follow the logic (or lack of) of the authors. They would go pages of plain text without and summary, highlights, or bullet points. In some of the figures the authors intentionally planted several errors (without marking them), and you'd stare at the figure for sometime and get confused, and need to go the tedious explanation to see what is going on. Who in the right mind would write a textbook like that?As for the non-traditional divergences brought up by another reviewer, this is a textbook that is supposed to be about standardized and well-accepted modeling and designs so you can communicate with others, why do you ever want to learn some non-traditional divergences that only the authors use?"
5,Pure facination for those who really enjoy the Civil War,"As a civil war buff who enjoys touring, I unexpectedly lucked onto this rare,out of print,1991 edition in a major bookstore recently.It was the only copy on the shelf. I devoured it in conjunction a Blue & Gray magazine trilogy about John Singleton Mosby's exploits during the war in Virginia. This Evans/Moyer book is loaded with neat little tid-bits of information about the man, himself, his many facinating associates and opponents, their controversial engagements and the multitude of specific locations where his ""Rangers"" operated from 1863 to 1865.Fortunately, many of these sites are still available in beautiful, historic, north-central Virginia. I give it 5 stars even though it's map/diagrams are confusing and can only be understood with the assistance of updated, fully detailed maps. Despite these defects the book deserves such a rating."
5,Joey is so Adorable and the others are hot too!,This is GREAT vid. featuring all the guys and a few fans but more of the guys than the fans WHICH IS WHAT I WANTED TO SEE! Thank you very much =) I think this is a great vidoe and it should be owned by all Nsync fans! SO GO BUY IT! Joey it sooooooo adorable I love you Joey!
5,ths video is the best thing since ...... Bop!,"this video is great! it shows them for who they really are. the music is beautiful, the guys are real and the videos are interesting! i highly recommend this video!"
5,Great Video!!! It shows the guys 100%!!!!!!,"This video is defintiely NOT a waste of money! It might set you back about $13, but hey, isn't it worth it to have 1 hour of 'N Sync on Video?! Oh yeah! If I could rate this video myself, I would have 1 million stars!"
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!,"This video is really personal with the guys and that's what everyone wants...to get to know those wonderful,talented guys!!! This video is worth every penny"
5,N Sync *N The Mix,The video was awesome! It told their whole story on how they got together. I loved it.
5,Its All About *NSYNC,"The video was great it tells you alot about them and you get to see them in their concerts and alot of backstage views. I would definitely recommend this video to any *NSYNC fan, ( Just to put you all on notice Lance is MINE! ) ( I'M *NSYNC's #1 fan! )"
4,It's good to have this on DVD!,"So I've heard that this DVD is getting hard to find in most stores. That being said, I was happy to know that this was available somewhere other than a retail store! I bought this mainly because I have been a long-time NSYNC fan and wanted their music videos on a format that wouldn't get ruined! Plus, I always thought their debut album was the best! So, it was nice to finally have this and cherish it! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I wasn't satisfied with the quality. It looks kinda grainy."
5,*NSYNC 'N the Mix-Official Home Video,I just needed to share my view about this AWESOME video. It is well worth the money. It is a fun and entertaining video with many full length music videos from their first American Cd(album). They are very talented and extremely HOT!
3,"PRETTY GOOD, BUT MAKES THEM LOOK STUPID","*N Sync is a really good group and their CD is really good. They make great music and I even have tickets to their next concert. That's why someone would buy the video and that's why I did. I was pretty disappointed. It was cool and all seeing them and how their days go, but the video made them as people look like a bunch of overexcited kids. It made me change my view of them. It kinda gets annoying after a while. I'm sure they're not like that normally, but whatever. It's ok and if you really like them and are in such a state of love with them that you couldn't care less how they act, them go and get it. I give it three stars...two for the great music and a bonus star for JC's sexy self!"
5,It Is AWSOME!! As Is EVERYTHING Else N SYNC does!!!,"Everyone I know, including myself, thought this home video, ""N THE MIX"" was AWSOME!!!! But, you know, everything *N SYNC does is awsome!! *N SYNC Is the BEST ever!!! They are WAY BETTER THEN BSB!!! ""God made pepsi, god made coke, god made bsb, what a JOKE!!!"" ""*N SYNC has got the flow, BSB has got to go!!!!""C-Ya People~ Peace Out StAy *NsYnC!!!"
5,I LOVE IT!!! JUSTIN I LOVE U!!! JUSTIN U R SO HOT!,"it is a great video, truly! Justin of course looks good but it aslo really shows the real sides of Justin, Lance, J.C., Joey, and Chris! Hey J.C. this is Sarah Guenther, i am from D.C. like u! I TOTALLY RECCOMENDED IT!!!!!!!! GO BUY IT NOW!! EVERYONE!!!"
5,The Best Video made by the stars themselves.,"'N SYNC is an awesome group. I'm so glad they made a video for their fans. It shows real scenes from concert performances, their music videos, and each guys tells more about themselves. I would recommend this video to everyone who likes or loves 'N SYNC. Thanx"
5,'N SYNC is #1!!!!!,This video is awesome!!!!! I don't care about all of them backstreet fans who dis on 'N SYNC because 'N SYNC is great!!! this video shows music vids and concerts!!!it shows how 'N SYNC really is so go buy this video you won't regret it and remember STAY 'N SYNC 4-EVER!!!
5,It was great,You should really get this video. It is all about the guys and also shows full length videos. This is the best home video you should really go buy it NOW!
5,'NSYNC ARE THE GREATEST GROUP OUT,"'NSYNC's In The Mix is the best video that I have seen so far. Justin,Chris,Joey,Lance,and JC are the five hottest guys that I have ever seen. The guys sing the best songs and they are soooo sweet to all their fans."
5,NSYNC ROCKS!!!,"Nsync is summed up perfectly in this video. It shows them singing, dancing, being silly, pretty much just being themselves! The are totally cute and the do alot of col things in this video. I would recommend it to anyone. Nsync is soo much better than BSB, so buy this video NOW!!!"
5,I love them all! I Love you JustinTimberlake!!,"I think that *N Sync is the best. They sound good and most of the time they look really hot (even Justin). I love the videos that have never been shown anywhere. I personally like the ""Here We Go"" video best. Justin is so cute when he sticks his tounge out. If you don't have this video, GET IT!!!"
1,This is the worst movie I have ever seen!!!,Backstreet Boys are so much better than N Stink! These guys don't even deserve 1 star!
5,NSYNC N THE MIX IS A GREAT THING FOR EVERYONE NSYNC FAN!,THIS VIDEO TAKES YOU BACKSTAGE AND GIVES YOU HOW IT IS TO BE A POP MUSIC PHENOMENOM!
5,This is the greatest band movie ever!!!!!!,"Ok, here's the scoop on the hottest band ever!! This video explains and tells you about the life on the road of each N' sync star. There are up close concerts and chats with them included. This is a must see video for N' sync fans!!!"
5,'N Sync is the best!!!!!! It was a good! I love Justin!!!,"I love Justin Timberlake. I went to there concert and it was the bomb! They all sing so well, and dance good. I wish I could meet them again!Stay *N Sync!!!"
5,*N THE MIX is da bomb,"*NSYNC are da bomb! The video is excellent and the guys are so funny. I liked seeing the music video for 'Here We Go'. It was funny when Joey got hit in the head with the basketball. LAnce took off his shirt. WOOHOO! All the guys were great in the video and i would recommend this video to ANY and EVERY *NSYNC fan, even people who aren't that big fans of *NSYNC will love this video, once they see it, they will LOVE *NSYNC."
4,The BOYS know how to rock!!!,"This video is awesome! I haven't had this much fun since I watched New Kids as a young teenager. Now that I am older I still love to rock. The act so like young adults, just like my roommate and I. We love the part where they sing along with ""I Would Walk 500 Miles,"" we still sing along with it just like they did (and we still do it to other ""FUN"" songs. JC looks great in ""I Want You Back"" the new version and of course so does Justin. Sometimes it is kinda of embarrassing for two 21 years but it is still cool and of course FUN."
5,It was all about the music group 'N Sync with them in it all,"I love this group, so it might have affected my review of it a little bit, but basically I thought that this video was great. It gave insight into the lives of the group, with humor and more, and gave interviews, but it showed them on the exterior too, concerts and more. You got to know them and see them in action, so I thought it was great. It's really just a biography and video about the music group 'N Sync, and it is all about them with them all over it in real life. All in all, I thought this video was fantastic. I definetely recommend it."
1,haven't recived it,i have still yet to recive this product so whoever was supposed to send it out hasn't and i'm not very happy about it at all.
4,IT'S ALRIGHT,"ok, i think this video was great because NSYNC was in it but the bad part was the fans part (this gurl was singing and it wasn't that great) i dunno about other ppl or is it juss mines but it's all scratched up so it was ok.. but if your an nsync fan go and get it cause besides those stuff it's great!!"
4,it has alot of info and fotage of the guys,this moovie is really good! Buy it! It has alot of info and plus they do the talking!It also shows you 5 music videos.If you want to laugh and have fun BUY it!!!
5,BOYLICIOUS!!,"This video was da bomb! It showed lots of scenes from 'N Sync concerts when they were dancing. 'N Sync is so good! It also included some footage of their videos, which I thought was great. I felt like I knew them better after watching it. They are all so great, especially the ultimate cutie J.C."
3,It was pretty good.,This documentary was interesting. I liked the part where they played the music videos.
4,This Video is pretty cool!,I really liked this video. Its nice to actually here the facts from the guys. I wish they had more live concert stuff. It would be really cool to see the whole concert experience and not just watch that disney thing over and over again.
3,Only if you have bucks to burn,"I am a HUGE 'N SYNC fan and excpected more behind the scenes footage, being this is the ""official"" video. There are some very funny and real life footage of the guys, but not enough for me to really reccomend this video. Most of the video is concert footage, which gets sorta dull after awhile. I would only get this if you really love the guys, but can never get out to one of their concerts."
5,This Video is Awsomse....,i just want to say this video is the bomb...if u love Justin ...u got to have this tape.....he look so cute in this video.....one thing i have to say is buy this tape ...it is so good.....
5,*N the mix with *N Sync,this is the funniest and cutest video in the world! you have to buy it! oh and I LOVE JUSTIN!
1,this is not a good video,"this video has nothing new. it is all old.if you like *nsync's old songs get it if you don't get the new cd ""no strings attached"" march 21. too much to pay for a cheap 80 minute video."
3,Carrie,"This is a fun travel trivia game. It's also the perfect game to play if you don't have much time and want to play a trivia game quickly. The questions are interesting, ranging from politics to music and film. Overall, I really enjoy this game for the purpose it provides. But this is definitely not a party game."
4,adapter plug,Adapter plug for trip to new zealand worked well. It was easy to find on line and arrived quickly. small and traveled easily. Would be helpful if it arrived in a travel bag.
5,Garfield is all wrapped up!,"You better watch out, you better not cry...Garfield is coming to town in this rib-tickling collection of Christmas tales! Whether he's waging the years biggest snowball fight, serving Santa's hungry little helper, or saving Christmas from some weird space aliens, Garfield will always find a way to keep Ho-Ho-Ho in the holidays! Garfield's five stories include: Garfield's Sweet Deal, The Great Snowball Fight, Santa's Hungry Little Helper, and The Rat Before Christmas! Greatly illustrated by Mike Fentz."
3,Classic gospel music at its best.,"All of these artists are legends. Their voices are very special. The selection of songs on this CD is good, but the recording quality is not the greatest. It is a pleasure to listen to this group of pioneers."
1,Beware of offensive language,"Raised by a single mother, Laker has to be the man of the house. When Rick comes on the scene, everything changes. Rick cusses and abuses Laker and his mom. When Laker fights with Rick, his mom kicks him out of the house. Laker, penniless, cold and sleeping on the street, meets Henry, 83, widower. Henry takes Laker in which brings its own challenges and surprises. They care for each other and find out how small the world really is.For mature readers because of offensive language...and there is quite a bit."
5,I loved it!,"I love this CD, I'm glad I bought it, it's perfect music for driving and working out. I've always loved their music, and I couldn't wait to listen to this CD. I didn't like it at first I must admit, but I kept playing the CD and following the rhythm and I love it now. Just give it a chance, you'll see what I'm talking about!"
1,Don't get screwed by this CD,"My complaint is simple: I heard the Safri Duo song ""Rise"" on Sirius. It didn't say ""Mix"", ""Dub"", ""Edit"", ""Vocal"", or anything like that. That track is not on this CD. The ""Rise"" track on this CD is ALL INSTRUMENTAL, which though still okay, is weak compared to the version with vocals. Apparently, Safri Duo just released an International Version, ""3.5"", which has it. This sucks."
4,Beautiful!,"Beautifully filmed by Australian cinematographer, David Hannan. The undersea footage filmed is of the Great Barrier Reef. Amazing exotic fish and stunning coral reef footage. Loved the optional feature to include subtitles of each creature's common names. Nice conclusion with the night dive, too. Unicorn fish...who knew?!A couple of additional vignettes also quick and nice if you want to flip around the menu: Dolphins surfing, sea lions, etc. Light music in the background.Also, you can set continuous loop or straight play. Useful if this is being used as background."
4,Like an aquarium,"The Coral Sea Dreaming DVD shows a variety of marine life in clear format and upclose. The format is more like a relaxation DVD and less like a documentary. For this reason, I'm reluctant to give it a 5-star review. Why do I still give it 4 stars? The answer is simple - picture quality is amazing. Even though it is filmed in nature, the sharpness, clarity, lack of fuzziness and timing is stunning, just like your saltwater aquarium, except the marine life is upclose and captured on DVD at the right moment (feeding, releasing larvae etc). You can also treat it as a screensaver or run it in the background when you have guests over. I'd expect it to gain the attention of a 2-4 year old, although a 7 or 8 year old might find it boring as it doesn't explain what the marine life is doing (unless you happen to be a marine biologist and can explain it to your kids while it is running)."
5,coral sea dreaming,"My son is in college in Maine for Marine Science. I saw this Cd in the eye doctors office. Every time I went it was on. It was so amazing. All the different fish and corcal. The color of the coral and how the fish hide was amazing.The fish I have never heard of most of them. I bought the Cd for my son for Christmas. He was amazed! We watched the CD so many time, and always found something new."
5,Spectacular!,"Spectacular! The video is fantastic. The undersea cinematography is great, high caliber work all around. The soundtrack is appropriate to video, relaxing ""new age"", done in Dolby Digital. Screen saver and Wallpaper for your PC. It will rank high in my collection of Reef and Ocean videos. I recomend it for a gift to a special friend. This work truely deserves recognition and support. In fact I'm going to look for more work by David Hannan."
3,Suspend Your Disbelief to Enjoy,"I couldn't get past the first three chapters. The reason is that I had trouble with the author's anthropomorphizing feline thoughts and behaviors.I probably would have enjoyed it more if it was in more of a fantasy instead of a mainstream church... but couldn't take the leap with cats discussing religion, and even ancient Egyptian art as if they have internal dialogs like humans. Perhaps would have even accepted it if it was clear they were scientifically ""enhanced"" felines, instead of regular tabbies.It's true, I was aware of the concept of the book before I purchased it, so I do NOT fault the reviewers or the author, it's just not my cup of tea. That is why I can't give it a BAD review, I knew what I was getting into."
2,I found it quite boring,"I found this title as a used, unabridged, audio book. This book did absolutely nothing for me. Too much chit chat and not enough action or intrigue to keep me interested. Of the last 20 audio books that I've listened to, this was the only one that disappointed. What else can I say?"
1,Glorymongering for rednecks.,I read Brown to get a belly laugh. That is about all her mysteries are good for. The rest of her books I never bother with simply because they aren't worth the effort. It is nice to see that Brown has finally gotten around to having some Blacks as characters. It will be interesting to see how long it is before she has Blacks or other minorities as pernament characters in her series.Sneaky pie has certainly gotten fat along with being vain and egotistical.
1,EXPIRED packages !,"I purchased several Senseo coffee pod packages. Two of them (10 medium roast coffee pods) were expired months ago (printed as 03/08/07 at the bottom of the packages) while others printed, for example, as 07/30/08"
2,Very Weak Coffee,"I find that these pods do not make a strong cup of coffee at all. In fact I don't really like any pods, they are all to weak for us."
1,Terrible Coffee,"Hate to say it, but this stuff made me throw out my Senseo and my guests agreed. Went back to grinding my own beans and using a french press - it takes a little bit more time, but if the flavor is worth it to you (I drink my coffee black), then this stuff is NOT the way to go."
2,Pods with quality coffee inside taste MUCH better,After searching high and low I found a site for 'Nossa Familia Coffee' that carries a coffee that is imported directly from a farm in Brazil! I guess this family has won the cup of excellence competition and they put their top coffees in the senseo compatible pods. The site is www familyroast com and I highly recommend it
1,Coffee was stale,We have bought this coffee from the store before and we liked it. It is however harder to find so we decided to get the subscription from Amazon. Unfortunately a couple of the packs were old and tasteless. We will wait another shipment and if the condition persist we will cancel.One big disadvantage with the subscription model: the initial price is not what one gets every time they ship. The price fluctuates and if one doesn't watch carefully there could be unpleasent surprises. Watching the price though makes it less of a subscription worthy buy.
4,Good stuff,"I really like the convenience of Senseo. Granted, I am paying for the convenience, but good coffee in the morning is a necessity for me."
5,Always a staple in my house,"My husband and I have Douwe Egberts coffee pods from our Senseo machine everyday and love it. The pods are easy to use and always taste very fresh, and I like the slight foamy layer on the top of the coffee.Each blend in this variety pack is very good on the flavor. Since we drink it everyday, its convenient that four flavors are offered in this case to keep things interesting. I find that each of the four flavors are smooth and medium in intensity, so if you like the other roasts out there, I think you will like all of these; the differences are very subtle. None are too harsh or bitter. If I had to choose, I think I like the Sumatra the best. the only drawback is that you get fewer pods for the same money than the regular roast 4-packs, but I dont really mind."
4,Good to hte last pod,"The Senseo coffee system delivers a good cup of coffee with voluptuous crema every time. The flavors are fresh and, though I often use the refillable pods to use my own coffee blends, this variety pack is my first choice for my first cup on those early mornings. If I buy it on subscription, it has to be good.I'd rate the product a fifth star, but the price precludes that, Still, it's a better investment than Star****s, that national chain that we all know and love. This is the next best thing to having someone open up a Star****s in your living room.I've given these pods and the Senseo maker as gifts, and the recipients are just as enthusiastic as I. Emceemk says check it out."
4,Surprisingly Good Coffee @ Great Price,"The coffee tastes better than I thought. I buy coffee for home from the specialty supermarkets and I was not expecting much from this variety pack Senseo coffee. As long as you just use 1 pod for a 6-8 oz cup of coffee, then it tastes fine. If you try to use 1 pod for a large cup of coffee like 12 oz, the coffee tastes so diluted therefore terrible.I defintely would recommend the Senseo Coffee and the Amazon subscription service for Small Businesses. Amazon give you a discount for the suscription service and free shipping each time, I like it !"
3,Fun to Try,This was a fun pack to try but to be honest the Dark Roast is still far better than any of these. The columbian blend is the only one of this bunch that I would consider purchasing again.
5,Good Variety good price....,"I love the Senseo Columbian pods, however, having a variety is better tho. I order these on the auto-ship plan and they arrive just in time so that I never run out and never get bored. Definately a good selection."
2,Mediocre Coffee,"While I like the brewing system. I found the coffee selection available to be quite questionable - and almost horrid. I would not recommend the coffee to an an expert. Perhaps if folgers is your idea of a great cup of coffee, then this will meet your expectations."
1,Bitter Water,"I've tried most of the Senseo coffee pod flavors. It is without a doubt the worst coffee I have ever had. Tastes like extremely bitter flavored water, and I'm not that picky about my coffee either.If you've got a Senseo, try the Folger's pods or some other brands -- this stuff is a joke, especially at the prices they sell for!"
2,Not exactly gourmet coffee,"I'd think that, for the price, Senseo Douwe Egberts Coffee would offer a great coffee sipping experience. That was not the case, in my non-expert opinion. The ""variety pack"" comes with four different blends. The ""Java blend"" tastes OK. The ""Colombian blend"" tastes like a regular French-roast type of coffee: slightly bitter and burnt. The ""Brazilian blend"" is the smoothest of the three. I haven't tried the ""Kenyan blend"" yet. I was rather disappointed with the taste of these coffees, as I am used to buy whole bean coffee from different regions. Also, why market a ""blend""? If Colombian, Brazilian or Kenyan coffee is supposed to be good, why blend it with an undisclosed variety? The good thing about these coffee pods is the Senseo method itself, which produce individual portions of a coffee that in intensity feels like something between a regular and a spresso."
3,Variable,I wanted a change from dark roast so I added this four-pack to my order. So far I have tried two. The Brazilian was way too weak. I can brew a six ounce cup with my machine and even that was too weak. The Sumatra was much better. Still have to try the other two.
5,too much fun,"my two year received this as a very early Christmas gift from his nanny. he absolutely loves it. he caught on very quickly how to operate the truck and move pea gravel. too much fun. wish they had hid the on/off switch. the bottom is the first place he looks on all of his toys to make them ""go go"""
2,Almost perfect but misses the mark!,"I thought I had finally gotten the ideal alarm clock: quiet sweep second hand, ascending gentle alarm, snooze button. A little big, but nice looking. I was disappointed when I turned off the light to go to sleep and it was glowing in the dark. It was supposed to just have a slight glow on the ""hands"". I really don't like any light as it keeps me up.Sooooooo.........it is going back and the search continues for the perfect alarm clock! Very disappointed.Anyone know a good clock that doesn't light up in the dark and is silent?"
1,Unfortunately it can't tell time,"I ordered this clock because I really wanted one where the alarm at first would go off softly, and became gradually louder, as I often wake up with a migraine. This clock doesn't do that, the initial alarm is loud and annoying. But worst of all, it can't tell time. The alarm went off 40 minutes early! I then tested it by resetting it to different wake up times and it went off anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes early. Ridiculous. Also, it does look cheap, black and faux silver plastic. I thought I was getting old time Seiko quality, but this clock is just another cheap thing made in China; more expensive than it should be because of the Seiko name. The only good thing about it was that the second hand did move quietly. I sent it back, and unfortunately, cannot recommend it."
2,The product does not provide the contents advertised,"I have the single disc version of this film, and it is the best quality example of the 1951 version of Scrooge, which is, in my opinion, the finest, deepest, and most sensitive version of the story of A Christmas Carol ever filmed.Subsequently, I read the fine print to the two disc version, which promised an entire DVD of extras, including the first version of the Carol, made in the UK in 1901, and the 1914 version, also a British production. The 1901 version can be found elsewhere. I have been looking for the 1914 version for years, but it has been held captive by BFI. So, when this DVD promised a bonus DVD with this silent version, I purchased it.They lie!And it was a cruel lie at that. There should be sanctions for a company which advertises content and fails to provide it."
2,More autobiographical than story-,"I like reading anything about the Adirondack region and even went to Newcomb this week to take a look at the place the author speaks of. However, the book seems to be more of the author's autobiography than stories about ""the last real people."" This is fine, but the title is misleading. While there are characters the author speaks about, they are more likened to ""accounts"" of these people rather than a more in-depth vision of who these people are. I would tend to say this is more of a kind of journal of the author's experiences in Newcomb than about the Last Real People of the Adirondacks. A book more suited for such a title might be the books by Helen Escha Tyler or a book called Growing Up Strong or My Grandpa's Woods. We get to meet some last of the real Adirondackers in those tales and stories. Still and all, this book is a good and pleasant read for any Adirondack lover."
1,Has this guy ever PLAYED a video game?,"This is a critique of video games, written by a person who has never played one. His research seems to extend as far as watching others play, scanning advertising materials and frequenting the game stores with a notebook in hand.The author gets the names of games wrong (_The Adventure of Zelda?_), and a section accusing the game _Dragon Warrior_ of sexism is especially embarrassing. He complains that the back of the game box does not name the Princess that you have to rescue. If he had bothered to OPEN the box, then he would have found her name displayed very prominently in the instructions.He does not even stop to consider the fact that most (all?) of the games mentioned in his book come from Japan, a country with a different set of cultural assumptions than his.This book is _very_ poorly researched."
3,psyco- and sociological analysis of video games and kids,"Although the current industy has a wider audience than when this book was written, it does an interesting job of asking how do video games affect our culture. It reads like a psychology thesis paper... I don't nescesarily mean that in abad way. It relates many surveys and studies about games and whether they induce violence, sexism, etc. in kids. If you have any interest in these issues it can offer some solid information and teach a little about the study of sociology it is worth some time."
2,Tastes horrible.,"I got this for the electrolytes, but it doesn't mix into water easily and tastes horrible. I have trouble motivating myself to drink it."
5,used at least a few times a month,"I use the key set at work, and so far, I do not think that there is a way to wear the medal out and no way to even bend the bars, even the smallest is hard to bend... now the bolts that are tightened by these, different story, they would break where as the T-bars are so tough, so care is used to not break the bolt heads off. was well worth the cost of these."
5,Excellent Study Guide!,"A Women's Bible Study Group I was a member of a few years ago went through the entire Ancient Paths series. We absolutely loved it! Very easy to follow and caused wonderful Bible discussions each week. The WALKING AS WIVES is my favorite and I still pull it out to this day because of the wonderful, practical way Judy Gerry brings out the whole ""submission"" and husband as head of the home topics. I have recommended this to most of the engaged and new wives that I know- even copied parts of it for some wives going through difficult times in their own marriages.This was also an eye-opening and relationship building series for me, too. Not only did I grow closer to the Lord but closer to my husband as I began to apply God's Word to our marriage and my role as wife.In short, Judy Gerry has written and excellent Bible Study tool that I will continue to utilize and pass on to others for years to come!"
5,It's Great,"I have tried numerous other (less expensive) grinders. This is by far the best. It's a little bit huge and a little bit expensive, but totally worth it."
5,No Comparison,"I frankly was reluctant to spend this much for a grinder but there is just no comparison between this and all the other plastic grinders available. It is solid, heavy, well-designed, and grinds well. It seems like a grinder that could last many many years since it grinds slowly and powerfully, never straining. If you don't grind a lot of beans at any one time you may find it easier to just leave the bottom glass out and grind directly into a smaller container you can seal. That bottom glass is indeed rather thin and delicate. It would have been a bit more reassuring if it was made with the heft of the top glass. But this is a minor matter compared to the overall value. If you want to grind everything from french press to espresso or just consistently fresh coffee for normal days then this is the way to go."
3,needs adjustment,"I've only had this grinder for a few days, but right out of the box, I noticed ( small stuff) the measuring spoon missing and the lid to the hopper was scratched, made me wonder if I got a returned/re-packaged grinder? I bought this mostly for our french press and we also have an espresso machine. On first try, the finest grind was course ( for espresso)...and I actually notched it down one for my french press. I'm thinking I have to make some adjustments already, which means taking it apart...this displeases me already for the money i put out. All the other reviews seem so positive. I wanted to let someone know about the missing parts and scratches, but haven't been able to leave feedback to the sender. I will give this a go ...hopefully this is not my final review.KitchenAid Pro Line Burr Coffee Grinder, Pearl Metallic"
2,COARSENESS KNOB VIBRATES?!,Just received my 're-conditioned' grinder and the control knob for coarseness level vibrates when turned on ...is this normal among other users out there?! I wouldn't expect this knob to shake/vibrate when turned on (at this price and touted level of quality).
5,Very very pleased,"I'm delighted with this machine.I did find the factory setting to be too coarse at the fine end, but a few minutes following the instructions corrected that, and now it's excellent. The factory setting at the coarse end is very very coarse, and even with it reset for the finest possible grind at the fine end I wouldn't use the coarsest setting even for my press-pot.The uniformity of the grind is outstanding.The feed problems people mention are true - I do have to poke a few of the beans to get them over the lip at the bottom of the input jar, but I don't find that much trouble. Using a glass output container really seems to reduce the static problems (that and the fact that even at a fine setting there is little 'dust' generated).This machine is _very_ sturdy. I don't think it will need replacing for a _long_ time."
1,KitchenAid Burr Coffee Grinder,"We ordered this grinder after our Maesto grinder's switch went bad. We were looking at 1, finding a company that would stand behind it's product, 2, find a company that would be around/easy to find when it was time to replace the blades and 3, ease of cleaning the equipment. We are very pleased with the KitchenAid. Right out of the box, it looks and feels good. It is heavy and does not have that plastic feel to it. It is all metal and glass. They say that is part of the reason that there is less static. I don't know why there is, but I can tell you there certaintly is. The grind is actually fluffier when it comes out from the blades. The machine is easy to operate. The only negative we have noticed, and would certainly never keep us from getting another one, is it seems to be a wee bit noiser than the Maestro. we are completely satisfied with the purchase. We highly recommend this to fellow coffee lovers. Enjoy!"
4,A coffee-lover's must-have!,"What a unique machine! This is as close to commercial quality as you will get for home use. It is pricey, but the quality remains long after the price is forgotten. I love the Proline products offerred by KitchenAid. In fact, I own four of them..I consider them as decorative accessories in my kitchen! We grind fresh coffee every morning, and treat ourselves to a terrific cup of coffee to start our day. The KitchenAid proline guarantee is another selling point. I gave 4 stars. The only thing I'd like to see improved is the thickness of the removable glass jar. It's been all right so far, but I am aware that I have to be careful with it. If you are considering purchasing this coffee grinder, treat yourself...you won't be sorry!"
5,Works just as good as I'd hoped,"This is my fourth burr grinder, and from it's solid construction it may well be my last. I needed something better than my previous grinders now that I'm also roasting my own specialy coffee, too. I'm impressed with the consistant and even grinds that it gives, not to mention the speed and quietness of the unit. I haven't had any leakage from the unit, nor have I have the previously normal static mess. Extremely easy to clean. Yes, I'm very happy with this one."
5,Finally- a good coffee grinder,"After several years of going through grinder after grinder, and wondering why no manufacturer could get it right- I feel like I finally found the holy grail of coffee grinders.We only grind coarse for french press.This unit puts out a very consistent grind: very little fine powder mixed in (like all our previous burr grinders).It is quiet- nothing like the jet engine sounds from previously owned models.It runs at a consistent speed- regardless of whether hopper is empty or full (also a first, in our experience).Glass container construction, reduces mess & looks better.Overall unit looks great, amazingly solid, hefty construction.Worth every penny, given the alternative choices."
3,Burr Coffee Grinder not up to KitchenAid standard,"Given the Kitchenaid name, the ""Pro Line"" tag, and the high price, I expected better quality of construction. First, the top glass container that holds the beans does not fit snuggly onto the grinder and so collects beans in the gaps. Second, the internal grinder cavity is not sloped enough and so beans collect around the perimeter. To coax them into the grinder, short of dismantling the grinder, the only option is to rock the grinder (as another reviewer noted). Third, as other reviewers have noted, the glass container that collects the grinds is flimsy. Mine is broken after one week. Finally, I had hoped to graduate from paper filters to the permanent filter recommended by Capresso. However, this grinder produces too much coffee dust. It finds its way through the permanent filter and becomes sludge in the coffee cup."
1,CERO EN CALIDAD,"TODAS LAS CANCIONES SUENAN IGUALES, CON LOS MISMOS SONIDOS Y TEMAS DE SIEMPRE. PARECE MAS UN DISCO QUE TOCARIAN EN CUBA COMUNISTA PARA TORURAR A ASESINOS Y A ENEMIGOS POLITICOS CONTRAREVOLUCIONARIOS.

4,"Good, Inspirational","My nine year-old son liked this film. It is a reminder that we are not here for ever and there are more important things than football. Twenty-something James Caan is great in this one. Bill Dee Williams also works well with the other actors playing a very interesting Gale Sayers. It's a sad film, but very meaningful. None of us knows when our ""number"" is up."
2,Review VHS Brian's Song,"Movie clarity is poor. It has several places where it blurs and you can barely make out the faces and the words get fuzzy and distorted. I actually thought I was buying a DVD when I purchased it, my mistake!"
5,All time GREAT movie,"One of the best films to have ever been made. When you stop and think about the time frame this movie and this real life situation occured, you have to be amazed. I'm sure there is renewed interest now with the passing of another Bears great, Walter Payton. This movie will leave you touched beyond words, you will feel the need to watch it over and over. This is a movie for all sex's, ages and races. Enjoy, but remember to bring the tissues, fo you WILL need them."
5,The Best Ever,"I just need to say I am looking at this movie as I am writing this for about the 100th time, still with tears running down my face. I have loved this movie every since it came out when I was 10 years old. With the lost of my father the year before the movie really touched me and made my mother never want to look at it again. Then growing up with old timeer stopping me to tell me I looked so much like the real Gale Sayers made me love the movie even more. Now with what is running through my blood and not knowing what will happen to me all I can think of now is my best friend of 25 years and him standing by my side. As you can see this move has really been a part of my life almost all my life."
5,Great Memories,"I'm so glad that Amazon had this available. My husband loves this movie, so I bought it for his birthday. It was in great shape, and it's a good show. Thanks again!"
5,Brian's Song,This product was in perfect shape. I loved this movie when I was a teenager (several years ago) it has a good message of courage and friendship and I wanted to pass this on to my teenage son--I am very glad that you had this available.
5,Superbv,"Years go by and repeated viewings only confirm the fact that this is a tremendously moving film. The compact script is superb, the performances touching. The rarest of breeds, an honest tearjerker. And to think that this was originally a TV movie..."
5,Great for a real cry!!!,This is a true story and have watched about a dozen times and cry my heart out each time. Unbelievable....great if you need a great cry....wonderful oldie!!!
5,Walt Would Approve!,"Rev. Anderson skillfully enlightens the reader to a higher level of Disney animated classics. He lifts up scripture from the Bible and shows the reader how its lessons live on in numerous Disney animated films, created during Walt Disney's lifetime. If Walt were alive, I believe he would highly approve of Rev. Anderson's insights. Exploring Christian values by comparing them to popular stories is a creative and fun way to get the entire family to study and learn from the Bible. Each chapter is a sermon for modern times; his insights are shared with humor, touching stories and wisdom. Rev. Anderson even includes study questions for adults (children of all ages) to continue their learning, on their own time. This book is a treasure for the whole family, a valuable companion to the Bible and represents a scholarly view into the world of animated art."
3,The irony is that Disney was not a Christian....,"The irony of this book is that the author, and the readers, have completely misinterpreted the intentions of Walt Disney. Disney entertainment was never intended to ""promote the ideas of Jesus Christ"" it was intended to present an alternative to the Bible as a source of morality.Disney used pagan imagery and stories to present stories of moral guidance that of course have much in common with stories in the Bible because the they are parables used to teach a moral lesson.So, I just find it ironic, that Walt Disney, who was not a Christian and who intended to present an alternative to Christian based morality by providing non-Christian moral stories, is being hailed as a promoter of the Gospels. His whole point was to show that Chrisitians don't have a monopoly on morality."
5,Really interesting,"This Bleach Movie was definitely unique in what they were trying to get viewers to see. It was original, the graphics were stunning, ESPECIALLY in Blu-Ray, and you never knew what new twists were around each corner. And of course seeing how Ichigo has several challenges to face, and most of them aren't just beat up the bad guy, makes it a great movie from and intellectual standpoint. Definitely a necessity for fans."
4,Bleach!,"I love bleach, and this is a pretty good movie. I would say that it is probably not the best one, but well worth getting"
4,"good movie, unwanted subtitle","I thought the movie was great. the only issue i had was that i couldn't take the subtitle off. i tried doing it in the set-up, but it would come back when i start the movie.Any one had this isse and know a way to get rid of it? it annoying since i am watching it in english, i don't need the subtitle too. And not to mention the subtitles don't always match the audio."
5,bleach fade to black english dubbed,"love the bleach series and movies, hope they continue making movies and the series! unfortunately i started watching it in the english dubbed version and got used to the voices to each character and now i have to wait longer for the seasons to be released so i am really far behind!"
3,its alright nothing to get excited about,"TO start off i am a huge bleach fan. I love both movies the first being my fav.the wait for this movie has been long very very long. I bought blu ray verison of fade to black and put it in the ps3 right when i got home.The blu ray looks great the colors are bight and crisp no complaints here. The story is this movies biggest weakness, it was boring the only thing that saved this movie was the fight scenes(ichigo vs renji) and those seemed few and far between. i had a lot of hope for this movie as i read a bunch of positive reviews. while it serves its purpose, it just falls short. if you are a bleach fan its watchable. i hope the wait for the 4th movie is better and is released quicker then this one."
3,It would have been more.,It would have been a lot more if it was in English dub.That would have been really great movie to watch.Jack!
5,Myleene lets the music flow!,"Usually I don't like piano music because to me it sounds like they are banging on the keys to get emotion out of the songs, Myleene knows how to let it flow with passion and not banging."
5,Fantastic!,"She is outstanding! She shares several selections with the playlists of performers such as Vanessa Mae and Escala, but with her own style (and piano) - just amazing.Some have commented on the huge variation in musical style. While (thankfully) I find no trace of hip-hop (as one reviewer noted), the track selection is all over the place - variations on classical composers as well as modern movie soundtracks and some stuff in-between. To me, this variety makes the album more interesting - I see it as a Good Thing.I didn't care much for the drum machine in Track 6 - Moonlight Sonata (is this the hip-hop that the other reviewer mentioned?). Fortunately, Myleene anticipated my objection and included a bonus track #13 of Moonlight Sonata without the drum effects. Thanks, Myleene!The only bad thing about Myleene Klass is that she has only one full-length CD. I wish she had more, and I hope my wish will come true soon."
4,Movin On,"Myleen's piano pieces on this cd are so calming, I use her music to paint by in my studio.I can turn the volumn up or down to create the atmosphere desired while creating.Fred Wilson 3Artist"
1,crap crap crap,"i wish people like this would stop ""making music."" this chick, charlotte church, and andrea bocelli is WHAT""S WRONG with classical music. dumbing down bach for the masses is disrespectful to all true classical musicians, composers, conductors... etc. this is such crap."
1,Not as pictured,"When I bought this I expected to see what is in the picture; spongebob mugs, spongebob hot cocoa packets. But instead I get spongebob mugs and nestle hot cocoa packets. If I wanted the mug set with the cocoa packets I would have gone to walmart and purchased this for $7. I contacted customer service and was issued a partial refund."
2,Terrible for hermit crabs or water turtles.,"Hermit crabs climb. I'd say if you don't mind trying to find your crab every morning, by all means, go ahead and use this. Like another reviewer said this would be a death trap for a baby water turtle. This isn't some cheap quick fix habitat because you didn't do enough research."
2,missing part,"Ordered the habitat for turtles and I didn't receive the tree that went with it. That was the main reason I ordered it. To much of a hassel to return it so I'm using it like it is, but disappointed!"
5,Great candy to use as a throat lozenge.,"My husband has been going through cancer care, chemo and radiation, and has had dry mouth. He swears by these to help keep his mouth moist and coat his throat so it doesn't feel so irritated. They taste wonderful."
4,Just what I was looking for,"I love honey! While on vacation in Colonial Williamsburg I ran across individual packages of the Honees candy and bought a few( there were only a few in stock, in fact). I looked in many stores since then but had no luck finding them until I went to Amazon. I now have a 24 bars.Each has 12 of the individual liquid filled gems in them and I am set for quite a while. I can even share with my husband!"
5,What the heck are Ambrosoli Honees Honees Bars?,"Ambrosoli Honees Bars is actually a misnomer. They AREN'T candy bars. They are retangular hard candies filled with actual honey. You suck on the mild flavored hard honey candy that slowly dissolves in your mouth. All of a sudden, you reach the honey filled center, then out flows the honey. There are 24 packs of 9 pieces each of individually wrapped honey candy. Great for sharing and believe me, once you taste these you'll want to share them with everybody.

5,Ambrosoli Honees barrs,"These little drops are amazing! At the first sign of a scratchy throat, these are the first things we reach for. The taste is wonderful, with a smooth honey inside. Love them!"
5,Really good book,"If you are interested in learning about nazi concentration camps, this is the book, It is a real story, Olga the writer is a survivor from the Aushwitz concentration camp, she is a ver good writer, is easy to read, I stongly recommend it."
3,Out of Date,"This book is way out dated! I am using some of the concepts and got some good ideas, but overall I don't think I would recommend this as a one source guide for teaching preschool at home. I was hoping to get more from the Bible lessons and physical educaton portion. However, I prefer to use actual Bible stories. This book seemed to go more with Bible concepts on family and creation. That's okay but didn't fit our family's desire. Also, the physical education portion was way too simplistic. I just try to provide plenty of opportunity for exercise and outdoor play...don't need a book for that. I figure his motor skills will come naturally just by being active."
5,Great,"My 300 C runs better. its a bit loud great for around town more noticable on Interstate, if you drive mostly the Interstates get the touring system, or just turn up the sound system."
5,Great!,"I have just seen a few numbers, and they are great - great music, good sound, very good visually - very professional. I don't know all of the groups or all of these songs, but so far, it's great entertainment."
5,Great book,"The book came on time, in fact early, and was exactly as promised. I am designing and modifying several gardens around my house and want most of them to reflect an Asian simplicity and directness. This book gives me the ideas and practical advice about how to do that. It has many lovely photos which are beautiful in and of themselves as well. A fine book to leave around for others to see as well, sort of a not-too-large coffee table book."
5,Perfect gift...,"Purchased this book as a gift for a friend who has a Japanese Garden and she LOVED it. I was a little worried, since I really don't know anything about the topic, so I bought this based on the reviews and crossed my fingers. I would recommend this based on her excitement. She's very knowledgeable and thought this book would be wonderful for her to expand her knowledge and to use when working with her landscape architect. As an aside, I looked through it and the pictures are just beautiful."
4,clouds,"I liked CD very much. And it was not just music or lyrics, but rather overall feel of it. It is very easy to listen."
3,okay.,"living in a southern town, i thought amazon was my only choice when it came to a phin filter. definitely works okay, and is fairly sturdy (i do not understand what other reviews were talking about-- handles? weird.), but go figure i found a better one at the same price at the one asian market in my town. this one has some definite disadvantages-- it's just a little on the small side, and the threaded area of the screw-down filter is very short. in fact, if not slightly under-loaded or not completely dry before filling, it just will not screw down the proper amount. not bad for the money, but not great either."
1,crap,"package arrived on time, but upon opening it, we discovered it was a lightweight, looked like the product picture, but leaked like a sieve."
1,OVERPRICED SHIPPING!,c'mon! really? s-e-v-e-n dollar shipping for an item that weighs less than a few ounces?
1,A disgrace to the anatomy and physiology subject.,"Do not buy this book! I am an anatomy professor and one class that I teach is eye anatomy and physiology. I have read bits and pieces of this textbook, if it can even be called that. The book is horrendous! When I was getting my Ph.D. degree in human anatomy, all of my class professors warned the students to never buy or read this textbook. I took their advice and didn't read the book when I was in college. A few weeks ago, I was reading some of these reviews saying how bad the book was and decided to purchase my own copy. I just wanted to see if the rumors were true. They are true! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
