2,ON MY 4TH REPLACEMENT!,I first bought the machine in 2009. After 3 weeks it made only 2 oz cups no matter the setting. Replacement did the same thing after 3 months. The 3rd machine kept turning itself off mid brew after about 6 months. 4th machine will not suck any water after 14 months. It just says brewing....brewing ... brewing. The one positive is they keep sending me replacement machines with little argument. Just PLEASE improve the manufacturing!
1,The machine is very short lived,"I bought this machine and used it for 18 months. Despite regular cleaning and descaling, the machine is broken and completely non-usable at this point. It won't brew anymore and keep asking to be descale even after multiple times of descale as recommended by the manufacturer. I will not recommend anyone to buy this machine. Keurig needs to work on this system a lot more to make it worth buying."
5,"2nd one purchased, works great newer larger water resivoir holds maybe 1 more cup","great product for the ones that only have 1 or 2 cups a day, if you're a full pot drinker, then i would look elsewhere."
4,Customer Service Surprise,"I purchased my Kuerig Platinum Brewer November 16th, 2010. I absolutely love it! Unfortunately, 7-8 months, the sound it makes when brewing became very loud and I was worried it would fail soon. After 13 months, it finally quit working. I called customer service, and they did some troubleshooting over the phone that did not fix anything. Much to my surprise, even though it was a little over a month beyond the warranty period, they are sending me a new one. They are not charging me for shipping a new one either. In light of all the negative comments here and other places, I just thought I would share my very positive experience with Kuerig Customer Service:)"
1,AVOID TOTAL JUNK,"This brewer is total junk, and the manufacturer does not care. This machine is less than 2 weeks old and has quit working. Only draws water when it feels like it. (not very often) Constantly shuts itself off, and when it feels like brewing a cup it takes 10 minutes. I called customer service, and they jerked me around for several calls. They are finally sending out a replacement unit,but it has been over a week and still no unit. (they were much quicker to take my $170 when I bought it) To be honest, i really don't want the replacement.i think the product and the company are worthless. Do your research and see how many people are having the same problems."
3,Single cup coffee maker,"I resently returned from Hawaii and I brought back several pounds of Kona coffee. I'm the only one who drinks coffee in the house and I wanted to buy a single cup brewer. I searched the web for what I could find thatwould fill my needs.I decided on the Keurig B-70. It was around $200 dollars, which is a lot, but I thought this would be what I needed.The problem is that you need a to purchase a metal filter that costs over $20 that doesn't come with the machine.So, I had to buy this extra and wait another week to use it. I think this should be included for $200 bucks. Also in the photos it looks like stainless steel on the product, But when you see it in person, it is painted plastic. It's OK, based upon other items it should cost more in the range of $100. If it holds up for 10 years, I'll be happy, I only use it on weekends."
1,Disappointed,"Keurig B70 Gourmet Single-Cup Home Brewing Systemis just a disappointment. It has some nice features but it just doesn't make a strong enough cup of coffee if you choose to make the largest cup. It makes a decent tiny cup.Using the same size K cup to make a small to xlarge cup just doesn't work. The brewing time is the same, so if it drips more water through the same amount of grounds, how can you get the same strength for the large cup of coffee? I bought the Senseo Supreme and it's great. You can insert 2 pods to make the large cup."
1,DON'T DO IT!!!,"Simply wanted to let you know the TASSIMO TAS65 blows the Keurig machines away! Don't believe me, go to the Amazon Tassimo Tas 65 machine reviews. I own one and it is the best, plus it can do what the Keurig can't. Coffee, Tea, Lattee, Expresso, hot chocolate and more!!"
2,Its all about the coffee,"I bought a B70, after it was recommended to me by friends. My husband also has a similar one at work (the commercial B100? ). I read the reviews and thought I would give it a try. I was very disappointed in the coffee. It tasted very weak, even on its smallest brew size. Only the ""extra bold"" varieties were acceptable. The hot cocoa was a joke! The water does not have enough time with the beans to extract good coffee flavor. I feel that it is not worth trying every K cup out there to brew 6 oz of OK coffee. Cuz its really all about the coffee. If you don't love it, you'll be back to buying it at your favorite coffee place. Yes, perhaps I had a dud. But my gut is telling me that I will feel the same way if I got another unit. I really wanted to LOVE it. It makes a lot of sense for our family. I wish that it would have worked. I feel it's too much money for what it actually delivers."
3,TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET THIS,Ordered on August 2nd. August 9th the product still hasn't even shipped. Be prepared to wait a long time to receive this.
4,think about it,I bought my first Keurig in April of 2010 and I just received my 5th replacement. They run great for about 6-8 months then just quit. When I call in and give them the serial number they just say have you done all the steps which I do before I call in and they send another in about 7-10 days seems I always have a new one. But I do love my Keurig problems or not.
1,Two Units in Three Years: I give up,First one I got quit working in 4 weeks. Returned it to Target and started over. 2nd unit quit working after 2-3 years. Personally I am tired of high price processing for coffee. Graduated to pour over coffee system--- really inexpensive and better brewing.HIC Porcelain No. 4 Coffee Filter ConeAs for the individual tea preparations--- changing from a tea bag to a plastic cup and charging how much more? Marketing genius. Or should we just let the maker pour out hot water and put the tea bag in.
2,It's not working well.,We were very pleased with the B-70 for about l1/2 years. But now it is failing. We did all the suggested fixes but it is still giving us problems. Called Keurig and they said we will sell you another one for $117.00. Don't know if I want to buy another one if it is going to go bad like the last one.
5,Great Product,"I bought a high end Tassimo brewer last year for around $200.00 ($150.00 with the rebate). The brewer was great but the coffee packs tasted like they were instant coffee and did not taste like the original product. Also, the coffee packs were hard to find and when you did find them, most grocery stores did not offer to many flavors. The Keurig B-70 Platinum cost me around $160.0 and does basically the same as the Tassimo (Except you can't make lattes and cappuccinos with the Keurig). The main difference between the two is that the coffee packs for the Keurig are a whole lot easier to find and they taste more like real coffee instead of instant coffee. I also like the fact Keurig lets you brew your own coffee by using the coffee filter that is available and sold separately. (They should include it with the purchase).But over all, I like the brewer."
2,Well I got about a year before it died ...,"... so I am doing relatively well. Oh, this is my 2nd Keurig too. First one died after about a year too. Can't say ""you get what you pay for"" because these are not cheap and should work longer than one year IMO. When I came home today, it was OFF and no way can I get it to turn back on again. I have been having some problems with small amounts of coffee brewing so I knew the end was near. Why can't someone make a single =serve coffee pot that lasts like those old Mr. Coffee pots used to last."
2,Keep malfunctioning - going to need a THIRD unit,"I love this coffee maker and I love how it works. Making one cup at a time is perfect for me. I think overall the unit is good from a design stand point with a few minor gripes:1 - Power switch should be on side or somewhere more accessible.2 - Reservoir could be easier to remove - seems like I shouldn't need to tilt or should be easier to grab when removing and replacingHOWEVER, and this is a big one, it just doesn't seem like these things work for long. I've had two units and both have had issues pumping water. I'll need to get another.With that said, their service seems decent on the phone. They have long hours and are convenient to reach. Plus, they shipped a unit to me without having to ship old one back.We'll have to see how the third unit I get works and if it lasts."
5,The best coffee!,I have had my brewing system for two years now and with proper cleaning it's still going strong. The coffee is expensive especially if you drink a lot like me but once you have this coffee you can't really go back to the regular drip maker's because it's just not the same. This is perfect for when you just want one cup of coffee fast too without having to brew the whole pot. I love the varieties of coffee and the brewing system works excellent- just make to de-scale when it says to so it will last a long time!
1,B70 Dead,I have used the B70 for about 11 months and its now as useful as a rock. It turns on but will not dispense or suck up the water properly. Any machine that fails in 11 months is completely useless in my book. Especially a coffee machine that is sold for $160. Hopefully its not a hassle to get a replacement. I'm lucky it failed under warranty.
5,Love it.,"Works great, now I get to have coffee before I head to work instead of waiting till I get to work....and I get to have good coffee, not prison coffee."
2,NOT worth it - tons of problems,"I am so upset about my coffee maker. I received it for a gift in 12/09 and for the last six months, it has randomly shut off, made inconsistent sized cups of coffee, and required me to become very creative with how I get my morning cup of coffee. I have descaled, I use bottled water and I have cleared the pin on so many occasions - I feel like a Keurig repair man. Nothing is worse than having to scream for your coffee in the wee hours of the morning. I had high hopes and the quality is sub-par for such an expensive coffee maker. The web is filled with discussion boards of the same complains and it is my understanding that Keurig is ""surprised"" with every phone call to their customer service. Wish I could recommend the machine (as I did to many people when I first got it) but it is NOT a good purchase. Lasts about six months on average from what I read on the web."
1,Platinum series is terrible,Bought a platinum series brewer. Wish I had never done so. Have to keep constantly unplugging and restarting to get it to work correctly. Piece of junk
5,Awesome,"I love it and so does my husband. Definitely worth the price. If you don't have one, get one. Brilliant"
3,Bitter Coffee,I bought this from Costco and love the concept. It is neat and clean and quick along with being attractive on the counter. After trying many different coffee pods including using my own coffee with a reusable filter I eventually gave up and went back to making coffee with a drip cone. No matter which coffee I tried they were all bitter. Some were just horrible tasting. Hopefully in time Keurig will address this problem.
5,Best Single Cup Coffee Maker,"The Keurig B70 is a fabulous coffee maker. It makes a really wonderful cup of coffee; a large variety of blends are available to use in the machine; and it is functional and stylish. By far the best single cup coffee maker I have ever used & worth every penny. I love the large water tank capacity, 4 available cup sizes (the travel mug size is a nice feature if you take coffee to work), and the very attractive design. But best of all---great tasting coffee every time. So many delicious flavors that it's a challenge to decide what to have each morning. I hestitated about spending this amount on a coffee maker, but am glad I did. Highly recommended."
1,Serious Quality Problems... On Our 3rd One!!!,"As others have reported, Keurig has a severe problem with reliability on the B70 machines. We are on our third one in less than a year. They work fine for a while and then they cease to completely fill the cups. Note that this is actually our fourth one since Christmas 2009 as our original, since discontinued Costco-only model B76 also developed the same problems. We've returned each one for a new one to Costco, who have told us that they have had a ridiculous number of returns (on the previous one the woman told me it was the third one she'd taken back that day!).Wonderful machine when it works, but this is ridiculous. If this one dies also, we'll try and get through our remaining K-cups and then give up on Keurig.UPDATE: 8/11/11 Just returned the fourth Keurig, as it quit working altogether, and this time did not purchase another. We're done. Just amazes me how this company can't design a product that will last."
2,Product has design problems,"Bought three B70s within the family.Pro. When they were working all machines gave good cups of coffee.Con. One machine died just inside the warranty period, display failed, no control over unit. Replaced by Keurig after some delay.The other two died within 14 months. One had a display problem, could not change cup size. The other had a pump problem, giving intermittent cup quantity. As these two machines were just outside the warranty they had to be junked.Will not buy again and would not recommend."
2,Not Impressed,I was given a single cup Keurig for Christmas as a gift. I got it because my niece had one and absolutely LOVED the coffee it made. I tried the samples that came with the pot but none of them impressed me. I love Tim Horton's coffee and bought the extra filter to use the TH coffee grounds. Still not impressed. My Mr. Coffee has given me a better cup than the Keurig. I tried a coffee press this morning and even that is better than the Keurig. I'm returning the Keurig. Disappointed. I was hoping for a better cup of coffee. I have one cup a day and that cup needs to be as good as it can be.
5,"Once I tried it, I was hooked.","I had my doubts about a single cup system. But once I tried it, I was hooked. The unit is easy to use, clean, and quickly brews a cup of coffee. There is a large variety of coffee flavors to go with it. And there is an insert that comes with it so our own bulk coffee can be used. We told our best friends about it and they now enjoy their machine too."
5,Great buy with the eko filter,Great strong coffee with an eko filter to keep it environmentally sound. Perfect for a teacher in a classroom all day.
1,ALOT of angry mornings,"This is the absolute WORST coffee pot I have ever purchased! After only a couple days,it stopped brewing! I went online and found out ths probem was very common,and they have a technique called ""burping"" it,which became a very routine thing,and sometimes burping oesn't work,and I'll go up to a week with it out of comission. It needs to constantly be descaled,absolute garbage of an overpriced product."
1,not so hot really,"These come in many many different models and colors so you have to look around a bit for good reviews.We had one and I wanted to hold off for a little while to write the review, we have had one for over a year.This is a very trendy device and people seem to really like them in there kitchens they do also look pretty cool, but,,,,,The coffee that comes out is just not that good, it tastes about like coffee from a machine at a bowling alley. Not kidding, I dont know how people can ignore this. There is also the big thrill of beeing able to shop for about a hundred different 'crappy' flavors.The final straw is that they are cheaply made (like most everything these days) in China and expect it to last about a year or so. If you are going to spend the money definelty get the extended warranty.Hope this helps save some people some money."
3,not so great,"Well they make great coffee, but we are on our third one now in under three years. Different things go wrong with each of them. I do have to say Keurig has very good customer service. Like I said we are on our third one and they have replaced them without a lot of hassle. But I don't think we will call them when this one quits, we will go a different route."
4,B70 Keurig brewer,"I find the k-cups a little expensive. .25 to .50 cents a cup, though if you find yourself going to a coffee shop a lot it will be a savings"
1,Major pump problems,This product is great when it works. We just recieved our 3rd replacement and were able to make only 3cups before it stopped working. Hope they get this problem fixed.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE!!!!!,"We bought this machine in December and it worked great until this week. I read the website and it lead me to believe the needle was clogged. After descaling it, the machine now only produces half a cup. Read all the online reviews. The water pump seems to have issues. I am frustrated because we have become addicted to great coffee!"
2,Only lasted 18 months,"Purchased this Keurig brewer in May 11 and for the first 17 months was great, no problems at all, would have rated it 4/5 stars but now in the last week it has completely stopped working.The descale message showed up for the first time and I followed through the instructions but it seems like the entire system is blocked up as no water/vinegar is even making its way through to allow it to be cleaned...So thats the end of the coffee maker.I think it is close to being a great coffee maker but there are some serious flaws like this that frustrate you and mean the price you pay for it isn't really worth it..."
2,Over priced and poor quality,The product lasted a little over one year before it stopped dispensing water. I typically use it for one cup of coffee a day at most. Customer service is worthless and has you clean needles and descaling over and over again to make you think you are accomplishing something. This thing is just a glorified water kettle. For the money buy some other product.
1,PROBLEM BREWER...BEWARE,There is a probblem with this model brewer. After a short amount of time the selonid leaks onto the air pump and transformer. This will shorten the life of this machine. You know it's going when it can only deliver 4oz or no coffe at all!The other problem is it must remain upright or water leaks back into selonoid and clogs it from opening..thus no coffee.AVOID THIS MODEL!!
1,BigKitchen =big no no,"I ordered this product from BigKitchen on the 9th, and i recieved an email today telling me that they had a ""data integrity issue"" and were unable to give me the item at the price i agreed to pay for it. With is total bull! Nothing against the product, just trying to let people know to stay away from BigKitchen"
1,Unreliable product,"This product broke down after one month of regular use. This is not what I would have expected from a ""premium"" product. The manufacturing quality of this product is clearly far below where it should be."
2,Save Your Money if You Like Hot Coffee,"All the features and convenience of this brewer are great, except for the fact that it doesn't dispense a hot cup of coffee. I purchased 2 of them at the same time, one for my office and one for the kitchen. It's marketed to brew up to 192 degrees, the reason I upgraded from the mini brewer. After speaking with customer service I was told that 192 is the brewing temp (inside the tank) but it dispenses at around 170...into a ceramic mug and add a little milk or cream and you have a luke warm cup of coffee that has to be nuked for 40 seconds. I'm out $300. Don't want you to be."
5,Excellent quality and value,"I own this Keurig B-70 as well as the Cuisinart SS-1. They are both about the same price. After using both for a couple of weeks I recommend the Keurig over the Cuisinart.Quality of the brewed coffee with the Keurig is great. I like relatively strong coffee and find that I need to use ""bold"" strength or ""dark roast"" K-cups. When I do that, I find that one K-cup makes a very nice 8 oz cup of coffee.The noise level of the Keurig is not a problem. It is much much quieter than the Cuisinart.The convenience of the K-cups is great.I highly recommend this machine!"
5,Great Coffee Maker,"Keurig B-70 Gourmet Single Cup Home Brewing SystemThis is an awesome coffee maker. I previously had the model below this one and am happy that I upgraded. The main reason is that the last machine did not quite fill up most of our coffee mugs without either reusing the k-cup or using (2) k-cups per mug, which can get expensive. This model has (4) brewing sizes - the second largest size fills my regular coffee mugs and the largest one fills my to-go mugs with one k-cup. It's great. The only downside is that I wish the machine held more water."
1,Disposable but good customer service,"From the reviews i've read i was lucky with just over 12 months of so so use. Save your receipts is all i have to say other than i hope you like speaking to tech support if you buy this.......To follow up; customer service is very good, if Keurig sends out replacements like they did for me, then if there is a problem, it is just a mild inconvenience, not an expense. I thank them for their support."
1,Unreliable and Unpredicatable.,"This product is unrellibale and unpredictable. Multiple problems; makes a full cup intermittently. You never know when you get a full cup or a half cup. It also deposits coffee rinds in the cup of coffee, intermittently. Lastly after using this product for about 10 days, it stopped working. The word Prime displayed on the screen, and followed manufacturer's recommended guidelines to correct, which it did for about 3 cups and then stopped working. The only thing that works; it makes noise like a constant motor running and would not shut off, nor does it make coffee. Don't buy this piece of junk."
1,Failed without warning - Do not buy,"I've had the same experience as other purchasers of the Keurig B70 brewer. It worked great when I first got it, and it worked for about a year. One day it just stopped working. I opened it up to see if I could fix it, but I don't have the time or patience it takes to dismantle the thing in order to repair it.I have since bought a Keurig OfficePro B145, and I intend to descale it every couple of months whether or not the light comes on. We'll see..."
5,We like the convenience of this machine.,The machine is great. The only trouble we had was when we tried to refill used k-cups. We found there are two ways to get a trouble-free cup of coffee: 1. Use a brand new k-cup every time. 2. Buy the Keurig MY K-Cup filter and holder. With the MY K-Cup you can use your favorite ground coffee instead of k-cups.If you buy Medelco RK202 (two pack) replacement filters they are deeper and hold more coffee than the Keurig filter. The only drawback to using filter baskets is that you have to clean out the old grounds before you can use them again. The baskets are full of wet and hot grounds immediately after use so we have clean Medelco filters on hand for a quick second up.
3,"Great, but breaks easily","I'm sure this isn't the fault of the seller, but this wasn't working when I plugged it in and filled the resivoir. Called Keurig directly and quickly got a human to talk to, who walked me through a troubleshooting process that didn't work out. Had to get a replacement, but Keurig sent it out quickly and the new one works wonderfuly. Sending back the K-cup holder was all they required in return."
3,Good unit,"I use it mostly for tea, not coffie. I bought the use your own coffie attachment, works good, but seems the mount of tea I use for one cup, I can make a whole pot the traditional way. I use the k-cups for tea and hot coca and they work fine, but very pricey. All in all nit a bad machine. Can be programed to come on before you wake up and shut down by itself. that way all you have to do is worry about the water level"
2,ANOTHER DEFECTIVE B70!,"Count me as one frustrated Keurig B70 user. Bought mine at Costco about three months ago. Only use it to make one or two cups per day with highly filtered water from a Kinetico system. Two weeks ago I had the problem where the machine just hummed and no water or coffee came out. Called customer service (you have to call on off hours to get in reasonably quickly). They told me to do the de-clog and vinegar rinse thing.Did that, then a week later, I have the same problem with no water for tea or coffee coming through on the brew cycle. Called back, I'm told I'm getting a replacement. Hope it has more longevity than three months! When it works, it's great but so disappointing when you start trusting it every day for your morning coffee and you can't have any! Thank goodness I kept my little $20 Cuisinart 4 cupper. It takes forever but still makes a good cup of coffee in a pinch."
2,Very pricey for a disposable coffee brewer,I bought this in May 2009 as a replacement for a B70 which died after 17 months of use. This one just died today. So it lasted for 9 months. I'm going to buy 1 more and then I'll switch to something else. I'm probably an idiot for giving it one more chance.
1,Keurig a Disaster,"Worked twice and stopped, pressed Brew button and it just sat there. I had to power cycle the power button to maybe get the brew cycle to start. Finally returned it, clerk said they've had returns on these more than any other brand. Beware!"
1,A Little Lemon In Your Coffee,"This coffeemaker quit working less than 6 month after I recieved it. While they were quick to send a replacement,it also quit working in about 4 months. Stupid me never sent the cupholder back with the first one. How could I possibly get 2 bad units in a year? My first single cup Keurig worked for a year and a half and still works for my daughter.Live and learn. Back to my dependable Bunn. Coffee isn't as good by far,but it beats no coffee at all."
4,coffe maker,Great product. On time and coffee tastes great. Would recommend this item from keurig. Works as advertised. Could be a little less on the price but satisfied.
2,Where's the quality control!,"I received my Keurig coffee maker for Christmas. After 6 months...it quit working. Woke up one morning ready for my coffee and ""Whamoo"" won't brew. Press the button and nothing happens. Tried resetting the thing, still won't work. I'm not a happy camper. I hope it's under warranty. I'll need to sent it back to Keruig."
4,almost terrific!,"I initially purchased a Keurig around 2005. It worked great until recently - even went thru a move to Hawaii with it's destructive humidity and back to the mainland. In the first 30 days of our owning our new Keurig, we've had to clean the flow thru the needle that punctures the K cup 4 times. When calling, the technician said that hot chocolate cups will leave a residue that causes the coffee grounds to stick. One problem - I only use coffee or put hot water thru the needle for use with tea bags. Why did this NEVER happen previously and now it's happening about once a week. If this could be corrected, this appliance would again be at the top of my favorite kitchen tools with 5+ stars!!!"
4,Couldn't Live Without It!,"Love it. My only complaint is that the coffee is weak if it's on the larger cup settings. But, I don't use those settings very often."
5,keurig single serve coffee maker,"This is very easy to use. There are k cups for regular coffee, decaf, tea and hot chocolate. Being a non-coffee drinker, i can make a cup of coffee for someone and know that they it will be just right! I can have hot chocolate while someone else in the family has coffee. It brews quickly. I am very glad we bought this machine."
5,The BEST!!!!,"This is the best single cup brewer on the market! I can't say enough great things about it. Three different friends came over after I got it for dinner, and now each one of them has one of their own! LOL. Coffee is great ([...]), hot chocolate, white hot chocolate, English Breakfast tea, and the best choices for coffee you could ask for. (The most important part to me!!!)"
2,150 degrees - NOT 191 degrees,"Got a new B70 because the older model never got the water hot enough. I was told this one would DEFINITELY get hot enough.Set the machine to 191 degrees and not one cup (of the first three cups brewed) ever got above 155 (with three different thermometers).So, if you don't drink your coffee in 7 minutes....you're drinking a warm cup.JUNK JUNK JUNK.I hate friggen wasting money.Back it goes tomorrow."
1,Replacement B70 is shutting down.,Second machine is starting to act up like the first. I would like a machine that works for longer than a month.
2,12 months and the pump goes out almost to the date of purchase,"My machine was bought last year as a christmas present, over the last month it has been acting up, well yesterday it just stopped pulling water. I followed the web site instructions for a full cleaning, and it still did not pull water. I performed regular descaling about every two to three months and cleaned the needles/screens every few weeks. I'm an old electronic tech so this morning I pulled out my tools and a multi and discovered the pump was receiving dc voltage but it was not turning when triggered. Anyhow, very disappointing that this thing breaks a year after purchase. I'm going to look at the cuisineart for my next machine, it has reported less issues with the system."
1,Clogs up constantly,Horrible machine. Worked great at first but then starts clogging up and must be cleaned with a paper clip. I recently tasted the Nespresso coffee and it is amazing.
1,Keurig B70's can't be trusted - don't buy!,I have purchase 3 different Keurig machines over the last 2 years. In every case they fail to stop brewing with-in 1 year of purchase. The descaling procedure works but only lasts for 6-8 brews!I then tried to Cuisinart and returned it after 1st use as the flow was so bad that I could have brewed a pot faster. So I have a lot of K-cups and no good way to brew them!Would really like something that works. If you haven't bought a k-cup machine I WOULD NOT. Its a great idea but so far the quality of their machines is more than terrible.
3,Tough to get the mix correct,"We like our new Keurig system, but the coffee supplied with the system was waaayyyyy too strong for us. Sooo, we opted for the reuseable jnsert, and use our own brand. We are still trying to get that perfect cup of coffee first thing in the morning, but find that sometimes it's just a little too strong, and at other times it's just too weak. We continue to change the amount we use and are determined to get it right.we are sure that once we get the mix right, we'll love it. It's just taking longer than either of us thought it would."
1,Coffee taste is altered,Coffee taste is awful. Expensive buying small tubs of coffee when you can only get one cup of coffee. Wish I could get my money back
3,Coffee gets cold faster,"My only problem with it is that if I don't drink my coffee right away (like 5 mins), it gets cold and fast! The machine itself works great, no leaks, no fuss. All components are easy to remove and it's pretty easy to clean."
3,Just not impressed! :(,"After all the hype about Keurig single-serve coffee makers, this Christmas we decided to take the leap! My dad loves his Keurig, so I just know I will love mine, too... Eh, not so much. We went for the Vue first, as being able to control strength and also having 5 cup sizes to choose from seemed worth it. We were excited to get this $300 coffee maker home and see what it can do! I will say this, after brewing our first cup -- it was smooth. The problem is... It is really WEAK! No flavor to speak of, even on the ""bold"" setting! We returned the Vue to purchase this one, the Platinum... still I can't see what all the hype is about. These machines make weak, flavorless coffee, even brewing Starbucks coffee in them. I suppose the fast brew time is responsible for this... Not enough time to get any flavor! Disappointing! What good is an expensive, albeit convenient, coffee maker that brews mediocre (at best) coffee? Sorry, I don't get it. This one's going back, too."
2,great when it works,"Love the product, B70, when it works. Love the choice of coffees and the design. The problem is the unit keeps cutting off for no reason, meaning each time we'd like coffee, we have to wait for the unit to essentially reboot. Also, the amount of coffee portioned out seems to vary even when using the same setting. Took it back and heard many others are having the same problem with the unit shutting off. Too bad. I'm going to give the second unit a chance because we like the concept...but the unit must be reliable. We'll look for other options if this one also fails. Keurig is missing a grand brand-building opportunity, given they own the market. Quality control seems to be an issue.Keurig B70 Gourmet Single-Cup Home Brewing System"
4,Love it but....,"This is a wonderful coffee maker; however, after a couple of months of using it, it started acting up. If the coffee maker isn't used daily it starts acting up. It will just say brewing and suck in the water and then it will sit there for several minutes doing nothing and then the screen will go back to the home screen saying ""ready to brew"" if you press brew again it will suck up more water and might or might not work. The excess water squirts back into the reserve and more water than the selected size will come out. I have descaled a couple of times and barely anything came out so I don't think it's that. Not really sure why it only acts up some of the time. Other than this fluke it's wonderful. I have gotten in the habit of running it once before actually brewing coffee so I don't waste a k-cup. If it wasn't for the machine acting up within a couple months I would have given it 5 stars. Not sure I would buy another... seems several are having issues."
4,Perfect for variety,"This was bought for us as a gift and we are so thankful for it! My mom got it for us while I was pregnant because I was trying to avoid caffeine as much as possible, while my husband still wanted his daily morning dose. This coffee maker is the perfect solution and allows us both to have what we want / need. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the cost of the K-cups. I anticipate that once we're both ""on caffeine"" we'll go back to our regular coffee maker due to the cost savings we'll see. But, the Keurig will still be nice to have for those occasions when only one of us wants a cup of coffee and we don't want to make an entire pot."
1,lousy product,have used the product for two months.. then stopped working.. water in reservoir fails to transfer..tried all suggested solutions in owners manual.. nothing worked.. so i guess i just junk it.. what a crappy product
1,Not a good machine!!!!,"I have owned several of the pod maker style coffeemakers and none can equal this unit. We have using this maker for about a month and it is the best I have ever owned!!The coffee is the same each cup and is fast.Now I want to see how long ths unit lasts! We use itseveral times a day, every day.Well a year and 3 months later and the machine is having problems. For the price charged and needs to be replaced in less than 2 years....total waste of money!!! I will not buy this high $$$ maker again."
1,Buy the B60 instead,"We bought this as an upgrade since it has more choices for brew size. Like many others, it quit working after a few months. Keurig customer service was no help. We went back to the B60 which has been reliable."
1,My Keurig Quit working,"I had heard good things about your coffee maker and talked my husband into spending $139.00 for this item in December 2010. Here it is in February 2011 and it no longer makes coffee. Water heats up but it does not brew, I am very disappointed in this item. While it was working it was great not it is worthless."
2,Great Cup of Coffee!,"I am editing this review - I really liked these coffee makers - they just don't last. I've had two and both have died within a year. I wouldn't purchase again.I purchased this brewer after having the B60 at my office. This brewer makes a fabulous cup of coffee, in silence. If you're researching on whether to buy the B60 or B70 .. spring for the $30 more in price. The B60 is very loud and the B70 is nice and quiet.It's just such a pleasure to be able to accommodate everyone's individual tastes of flavored coffee, tea, hot chocolate, a mild blend or a bold blend without having to brew a separate pot of coffee or have tea kettles. This brewer even has an iced drink setting. I haven't tried it yet, but I think it's going to be awesome this summer.There are many, many different K-Cups to try. It's difficult to choose so you need to keep a list of what you like from the samples they send you with the brewer.Happy brewing!"
1,Good coffee terrible machine,"We are on our third B-70 in two and half years. I regret having ever recommended this coffee system to friends and family. Our household brews about 6 cups a day, after about six months the machine would start making short cups after another couple of months the machine just stopped working. We cleaned our second and third machine twice a month and still had the same problem. Of the dozen friends and family that purched or received as a gift from us a B-70, everyone is on at least their second some on their third machine. While it does make very good coffee having to replace a the machine every 8 months is very annoying. We have gone back to brewing coffee the old fashion drip way. It's cheaper and we don't have to feel guilty about throwing those little plastic coffee pods."
2,Not reliable,"What a great cup of coffee!!!! That is, when it works which is getting worse each day. One day it will deliver a nice cup of coffee - the next it will churn and grind and either deliver a partial cup or a few drops. I use only distilled water and have followed the descaling instructions. And of course, the warranty has just expired. This seems to be a common problem as it has also happened to several friends. I would not recommend this to anyone. I would've given it a one star but it did provide about a year of good coffee."
3,Coffee not quite good enough.,Machine works great but the coffee just doesn't taste that good. Lots of options but no really great coffee (like Peet's or Starbucks).
4,WOW!!,"We love our Keurig B70 Platinum..... We love the way we can have variety Etc. If we do not want a whole pot of coffee...perfect. If we or someone we have visiting wants variety...perfect.... We love it. The only thing we did not love was going to costco one week after purchasing it and finding it not only cheaper but it also had with it 60 K-cups and a my K-cup for your own brew....The only thing I could suggest to make this brewing system better would be its own water pitcher to fill the reservoir. I know it is removable, but kind of a pain in the rear... LOL."
1,Poor reliability of this coffeemachine,"Purchased this coffee machine in 2008. One year after (one use per day), got the pump to die.Unit had been replaced under warranty by KeurigOne year after, this unit failed again (pump)This time Keurig did not provide me with a replacement unit (whereas the replacement unit was supposed to have one year warranty)Conclusion: even when using the machine one time a day (not a lot!), pymp has a very poor reliability.Also, sometimes, it needed some reboot because the software had bug.Bad choice. I will not come back to Keurig."
1,What good is it if it breaks in a few weeks?,"This coffee brewing system as a serious design flaw. The pump stops working after a while and stops pumping water. It says ""brewing"" but nothing comes out. There is no excuse for this happening as I use nothing but filtered water.My coffee machine broke after 3 months, as the pump stopped working. It says ""brewing"" but no water comes out! I bought a new machine to replace it thinking it was a fluke and after only 5 cups of coffee the exact same problem. For the amount of money they charge for this, this company should be ASHAMED to make such a poor quality product that breaks so easily. This really makes me wonder who exactly it is that writes all these glowing reviews for this product as this is clearly a problem with this machine that still remains unresolved. Do not buy this machine unless you don't mind paying this kind of money for a fancy brewing system that works for a few weeks or a couple of months."
1,b70 Don't waste your $$$-Major engineering flaws,"I'm on my 2nd Keurig B70 unit in 2 months. Same problem as everyone else. After two weeks of flawless use it sounds like it is pumping water but no water is drawn. It then just turns off. Each unit was less than a month old when it started doing this after each brew. My wife bought it for me for a B-day gift in Nov. 2009.UPDATE!!--I just got off the phone with Amazon cust. service and was informed that they will not be sending a 3rd unit to replace but giving us a refund instead. I asked why and was told that they have been having many ""issues"" with this unit and will not longer be carrying it. If that doesn't say VOLUMES about this product i don't what does! Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this unit, find one that works!!"
1,Terrible Quality Control,"We purchased two of these - one for a small office, one for home - and in less than a month both failed suddenly. The pumps evidently are either badly designed or shoddily made, because they simply quit putting hot water through the K-cup. (No, there is no blockage. That's the first thing we checked.) Both units have gone back to Costco for a refund. Bottom line is - DON'T BUY THESE unless you want to roll the dice, hoping to get a good one. Keurig has a serious problem it had better fix before their reputation is ruined."
5,Great item. I use it everyday,"Awesome product. Very easy to use. The programming feature is really easy to use and it allows you to set it and forget it. The water gets hot and it's ready to go. If.you decide not to make coffee one day, no big deal, it just powers off after an hour (or whatever you have it set for). The 5 cup sizes is nice and you can program which size you want to be the default.Pros: Looks great, makes great coffee, and is very easy to use.Cons: I'd like to be able to completely drain the water out when I'm not going to be using it for an extended period.Highly recommend!"
2,Great Coffee when the brewing system works,"We love this coffeemaker. It makes delicious coffee quikly. Depending on the situation, I enjoy the donut shop and breakfast blends.In our experience, the coffeemaker fails at an alarming rate. We went through three of them in a matter of weeks. Fortunately, the service department was helpful in acquiring a new one when the old one failed. The old ones were a few days to a few weeks old when they died.The fourth coffeemaker lasted some time. It could have been 5 months. To our dismay, it failed recently.We want a coffeemaker with some build quality that last. We might consider the Breville version of the coffee maker."
1,Piece of trash,"My brewer turns off after each cup and sometimes only brews a partial cup. I've gone through every troubleshooting trick with the customer service people. They are very polite, but clearly read from a script and don't have much technical knowledge beyond that. They offered me a coupon for free Kcups, which would come in handy if I had a brewer that worked properly! There are dozens of similar complaints on the QVC website from where I purchased my brewer. I notified them of such, but that doesn't get very far. It sounds like some machines work well, but there are a bunch of lemons out there. I would just say Buyer beware, and make sure you save your packaging materials for at least 9 months as this was when mine kicked the bucket."
2,Good if you like weak coffee and want to ruin the environment.,"Well...the Keurig was a good try, but produces absolutely disgusting coffee. We even bought the re-usable K-Cup filter and used my coffee that is wonderful and it still tastes like rotten horse piss. Needless to say the thing is going back and not worth the price. I also did some research on the web and found it is not the most environmentally friendly device either. The little cups are not recyclable because of the type of plastic. If you are thinking about buying one of these save yourself the $$$ and headache.My advise is look the other direction if you are considering one of these. We tried all of the sample coffees that came with the device and nothing worked. Also read this interesting article: [...] to find out why you shouldn't purchase."
3,Who knows how well this product works?,"Since I haven't received it yet, it is hard to write a review. However I have learned a few things in talking to people who own them. The water lines tend to get clogged with air if you don't keep the reservoir filled with water. To fix this, turn the coffeemaker upside down so that the air bubbles in the line get purged.Also I have been told to use only distilled water. It does not affect the flavor but keeps scale from building up in the lines and plumbing.Wish UPS had delivered the machine as they said they did. I never got it. Maybe Amazon.com should require signatures on all items valued at over $100.00"
3,hearing loss after own keurig,I have two of these machines and if you can hear me right now you don't own one yet. I think the noise and vibration have caused me health issues. The machine works good and I use it everyday but buy a bulk package of foam safety ear plugs.
1,unhappy customer,"On 5/28/2012 I placed an order for the Keurig coffee maker.The company delivering it was called ""Fast Delivery"" I received it 6/13/2012. doesnt seem like fast delivery to me.When I opened the box there was no owners manuel to explain maintainence,how to use it,or anything other than a quick set-up page,.I called the company and placed an order for an owners manuel.Fidteen minutes later I received a call from them explaining that they had no books in stock and that i should expend my time ,effort, and printer ink to pdf it from my computer.When I complained to the representative that I felt that waqs a poor way to do business they said they would not be re-stocking the manuels and that if I wanted one to pdf it.After all that I had heard of their product this came as quite a shock.Dissatisfied does not begin to define how I feel."
3,Makes a great cup of coffee when it works.,"I have the B70 which I bought at Costco. It made an expensive cup of coffee on demand for the first six months then the trouble started. First it stopped taking water from the reservoir and then the amount of water in the cup didn't match the setting. The latest problem is it shuts off by itself. I have to turn it off by the switch, turn it on again and wait for it to heat up and ready to brew message to be displayed before I can add a K-cup or Pod to the Keurig for a cup of fresh coffee. My five year old Black & Decker two cup maker still works great and is lots cheaper to use. That has a small cone filter that makes a fine cup of coffee for my mug or travel mug."
1,Keurig B70 coffeemaker,First of all I must confess I am a diehard coffee drinker. I absolutely love a good rich hot cup of coffee in the morning. The Keurig is very convenient but the k-cup coffees are not as full bodied as I would like especially when making the larger cup of coffee and the coffee is not hot enough as it boils through the spout. The coffees themselves are marginal and expensive to use. When I used my own coffee the coffee holder is too small to hold enough coffee for the larger cup. In my book it's very expensive for convenience while getting only marginal taste along with not getting a good hot cup of coffee. Back to the drawing board!!!!!!.Keurig B-70 B70 Platinum Single-Cup Home Brewing System
1,DO NOT buy this product,"If and when this coffee maker decides to work, I liked the coffee very much, so much in fact that we recommended the Keurig to 4 friends, all of which purchased the Keurig. Unfortunately, after 18-24 months of use, all off these Keurigs have stopped working. YES, ALL 5 of them. The 'not ready' light continually stays on. Called the company the said to descale. I guess that is snake-oil for the keurig. I explained it wasn't brewing anything. She said she provide a $100.00 voucher towards another Keurig. I told her no thanks and I'm not interested in replacing a $200.00 coffee maker every 18-24 months. what a joke. DO NOT BUY this product. Or do buy this product and when it breaks...oh well!"
1,Water does not taste good,My son recently gave me a B70 Keurig coffee maker. I'm a tea drinker but appreciated the fact that I could brew coffee for friends. I have notmade one cup of coffee..but I have heated water for tea. I find that it does not taste good. The water has a plastic smell. Will this go away after more use? Has anyone else experienced this? I realize if you're using it for coffee you would never taste it.
2,DURABILITY IS THE ISSUE HERE.,"HOW MANY OF THESE 5 STAR REVIEWERS HAVE OWNED THE MACHINE FOR MORE THAN HALF A YEAR?? WE LOVE OUR MACHINE BUT ARE NOW RETURNING IT TO COSTCO FOR THE 2ND TIME. AFTER ABOUT 6 MONTHS OUR ""PLATINUM"" MACHINE SIMPLY QUIT. NO PUMPING. WE RETURNED IT AND GOT THE SAME UNIT ABOUT 6 WEEKS AGO. IT HAS NOW STOPPED MEASURING THE COFFEE. NO MATTER WHAT SIZE YOU PICK IT SEEMS TO BREW WHATEVER SIZE IT WANTS. SOMETIMES OVERFLOWING THE CUP OR LEAVING IT HALF FULL. SO WE ARE NOW CONTEMPLATING A 3RD MACHINE AT COSTCO? OR JUST A REFUND. WE REALLY DO LOVE THE MACHINE AND THE HUGE VARIETY OF FLAVORS, TEAS, ETC. WE WILL TRY ONE MORE TIME I GUESS. GOOD LUCK IF YOU GET ONE!"
2,Used and almost useless.,"I purchased my Keurig as a gently used machine, apparently used for demos only. When it works... it brews very quickly and I like the fact that I can select from a variety of sizes. If it worked each and every time we set it to brew - that would be a plus. If the plastic lid on the water tank wasn't cracked - that would also be nice. My husband complains the coffee isn't hot enough (set at 192), the largest setting doesn't come close to filling our oversized mugs, there are fine grounds in the bottom of the mugs, and even filled to the top of our refillable filters we can't get a very strong flavour. I ordered my machine back in December and had it shipped to a friend's house (no delivery to P.O. boxes). Plans changed and I wasn't able to pick it up for over 5 months. If I felt it wasn't too late I would have returned it."
5,Great product,"This is my 2nd Keurig, I have one at work and finally decided to get one for home when I saw the price for this one. Great value, shipping was as explained, slight dampness of the shipping box and coffee maker, just let it dry out naturally and you are all set. All-in-all very happy with purchase."
4,Texas blues at its finest - You'll find it hard to sit still,"This CD is Johnny's best work. Starting out with the title track which is a killer shuffle to which I could listen to over and over again. You will find it hard to sit still in your seat. All the way to the last track ""Life's Rainbow (Nature Song)"" which has some wonderful lyrics and was always a crowd favorite during is concerts. The CD also contains contributions by artists such as Clarence ""Gatemouth"" Brown, Lonnie Brooks, and Joe ""Guitar"" Hughes. Johnny Copeland was one of the hardest working bluesmen on the tour and this album demonstrates his passion and dedication to the blues. If you like Texas blues then you will love this CD."
4,Cave diving accident analysis. Learn from fatal errors,"Very important mind forming book about cave diving. Accident analysis covering the firsts statistical reasons people get killed in cave diving. s.Exley was among the most important people to learn from. All cave divers need this to play ""What if..."""
5,The Master of cave diving,"This is the Bible of cave diving,wrote by the pioneer of this dangerous but pretty sport,the great adventure of the last frontier underwater."
5,Xantrex Xpower Powersource ROCKS!,"I love it! I bought it for my husbands birthday cause our power goes out all the time. Twice just last week we were the only people for blocks that had light, tv, dish network, and a clock. It was amazing. The only thing we couldn't plug into it was the airconditioner. lol"
1,Do not buy this product,"I have a number of Xantrex products and have found them to be good quality. I cannot say the same for thier product support. I have a Powersource 1800 that shorted out. It is less than 2 years old (20 months). It is out of warranty. I am willing to pay to have it repaired. They will NOT repair it or sell parts for it. The best they will do is sell me another unit at 30% off list. I was informed by customer suppoer that they do not repair products that are out of warranty. So beware buying Xantrex(aka Scnieider Electric), Durucell branded Xantrex products, and APC(a Schneider Electric company). Once they are out of warranty, if something happens to the you can throw them in the trash heap."
4,Workshop Rotation:A New Model for Sunday School,Exactly what someone who is frustrated with problems of having a successful Sunday School program is looking for. Very concise applicable information from people who have been there.
3,Made in China :-(,"Just an FYI to add to the other reviews, this Winchester knife is made in China. That's not the end of the world, and the knife has a very nice heft, but...that's why the price is so low."
2,Rent it first,"After reading the two reviews above, I bought Stolen Kisses sight-unseen. I wish I'd rented it first. It may have been a pivotal film 20 years ago in France, but it hardly holds up. There's very little structure--the story meanders aimlessly from place to place. And I don't know what the reviewers above found funny or sexy--there's not a lot of humor (certainly not by today's comic standards), and there's no sex by any standards. Rent it first, then decide if you need to own it."
5,Among his best,"Stolen Kisses is a lyrical study on youthful love. To me, it ranks among Franois Truffaut's finest: The 400 Blows, Shoot the Piano Player and Jules & Jim. I'm glad you had it available at Amazon"
1,Inaccurate DVD description,"Beware! This DVD is advertised as being NTSC, when in fact it is a German import in PAL format (not playable in the US). I made the mistake of ordering it and having to return it because it is not playable here in the U.S. Amazon, please take note and correct this!"
4,The Pogues at the Town and Country,"This video captures the unlikely marriage of raw energy and turbo-charged Irish music that is the Pogues. As with most live Pogues shows, singer Shane McGowan's lyrics are unintelligable to the virgin listener, but this does not prevent his unique combination of sardonic wit and Irish charm to shine through. As for the band itself, this video nicely captures the Pogues for what they are: a highly underrated group of talented musicians."
4,Great for gigs and practices,"I am quite pleased with this cupholder. It comfortably holds soda cans, bottles of water and the basic sized drinks of the fermented barley genre.I do wish the 'pouch' portion of the holder was a little deeper so I could hold a larger water bottle for longer shows, but it is effective and does well what it was designed to do."
2,Should I use a Knife !!!!,Gamera is back in the 5th installment gamera vs this knife monster they called guiron.I own all 8 gamera flicks and to saythis one was kinda bad.It seem cheesy in ever way.The dubbing of course is really bad and the whole Guiron monster was alright but instead of a knife head monster why they don't use a fork lol.I know gamera films were on a tight budget but they really made a mess on this one.Alright monster action but story lacks hard.
3,Big Turtle vs. Knife-head,"Gamera the friendly turtle is back! This time out, he must help two kids who've been taken by remote control spacecraft to a distant planet. The kids have been captured by two cute alien babes in go-go boots, who want to eat their brains. They then want to invade the earth and get down to some serious dining! Will the youngsters survive this hideous ordeal? Gamera must battle a knife-headed monster named Guiron to the death. Can our be-shelled buddy save the day? Watch and see. My 8yo son loves this movie..."
4,Gammera rescues two kids who were kiddnapped by aliens,"Two kids, an american and a japanese kid, were kiddnapped by aliens and taken to thier planet for experimentation. This was my favorite Gamera movie. I am a great fan of Gamera."
3,Big problem with this DVD,"The scene where Guiron chops off Gaos's wings and head is completely missing! The best fight scene in the movie and it's not in there. Buy the VHS instead, at least that doesn't have a missing scene."
4,Bock Bock Bock Ba-Gock ( The Cackle of my Childhood ),"when the Tape arrived the top was broke and had to be replaced, other than that it plays great, about the movie, It's just how I remembered it, all including the part where Space Gyaos gets Beheaded and does his Best Chicken Inpression, that takes me back."
3,NOT THE SANDY FRANK DUB!,"MST3K fans will remember this film in it's horrible glory from the worst English dubbing company ever, Sandy Frank. This however is a different dub made by people who have a firmer grip on the English language.It's still enjoyable for the background music track stayed the same. So your ears will be treated to the same music, but not the same stunted English.I recommend this for someone who's seriously obsessed with the film and desperately needs it on DVD, for say, taking screen grabs, etc."
2,One of the most silly movies ever,"The delivery was fast and excellent, but the movie in itself was really goofy and silly and imature. Can be fun to watch on that account-maybe."
5,Attack of the Giant Swiss Army Knife!,"Well, where else are you gonna see a Japanese monster movie where a space monster with a ginsu blade on his head slices up a silver winged gyaos like a big rubber bloodless sausage? Or a movie where a 150 foot turtle does aerobic flips off two poles connecting some buildings? No where! 1 So buy this corny, badly dubbed Gamera classic NOW!"
2,Amateurish,"Although some of the ideas have potential, this book is very amateurish. The adage ""Never judge a book by its cover"" did not hold true here. When i looked at the cover, my first impression was slightly negative. Then i browsed through the book. There are so many pictures completely out of focus! At first i thought my eyes were faltering, but that's not the case (quite yet). Go to page 61, 103, 106, even the photo of the author's son in the dedication! This should be unacceptable, especially in a book that tries to convey suggestions and ideas for projects in a visual way.I did not care much for the romantic quotes and new-agey messages interspersed among the pages. Some of the projects look interesting and i might even attempt to try a few of them. But in general, i was disappointed with the quality of the book and would recommend that you think twice before purchasing it."
4,Best song is missing!,"Great, atmospheric soundtrack, truly haunting. My one major gripe is that they have every single track from the movie, even minor ones that play only momentarily, and yet they leave out my favorite one. The song that starts in quietly when Jack is watching the threesome through the binoculars and kicks in fully when it cuts to Sheri dancing for him. Such a great track and they didn't include it in the soundtrack. That track is what actually made me decide to finally spring for the album and is the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me. If anyone has that track or knows where it can be found that would be greatly appreciated!"
4,Best Value for the money!,"Was concerned that it would be too small but, the one I found at Walmart ($10.00!) was the 4 pistol case which was larger than I wanted but turned out perfect,holds 2 pistols and extra mags no problem. Not sure why all the negative reviews, if you want to spend $60-100.00 dollars on a pistol case, there are plenty out there, go for it, I like this case and am seriously considering buying another one."
2,No longer has diced pick-n-pluck foam,"I have about a dozen of these cases holding various pieces of camera and lighting gear. Nothing too heavy duty, but up until my last order of 2 more cases, they've always come with a thick inner foam panel made of diced pick-n-pluck foam. This made customizing the case interiors easy and very nice to create compartments where I wanted them. The last order came with the same good (cheap) cases and foam, but the 3rd foam panel is UNCUT, UNDICED, and thinner than before. Really frustrated by this change which wasn't documented anywhere before I re-ordered. Prior to this change, this was a 4-5 star product given it's price bracket"
3,"Good for storage, not transport","Great for storing pistols. Fitting 4 in it is a bit tight, but doable at least if some of them are compact or smaller. The lower pieces of foam is perforated and is perfect for cutting out slots to hold your magazines.As soon as you turn the case vertically though, your guns will clunk to the bottom of the case. The foam pieces simply aren't large enough to hold them securely."
5,My husband lloves this case,"I gave this to my husband for his birthday and at first he had no idea how he was going to use it. However, it holds 4 pistols very nicely as well as some ammo and is very convenient for taking to the range. Nice quality and light weight. He is thrilled with it and the convenience for carrying."
4,Good case,"I have 2 of these. I custom cut out the foam to hold ammo boxes, magazines, safety glasses, and hear protection without them moving around. I have 2 guns in the chase as well. It's never going to be a secure case that will protect your guns from theft as someone with a pocket knife could cut the plastic loop where a lock would go but it's great for carrying stuff to the range."
5,This case is awesome for all sorts of things,"So the case itself is very strong, as well as the clips that hold it closed. It comes with more removable padding than even usable, which is awesome. I do not, however, use it for pistols, but for my Warhammer 40k miniatures. The vehicles, ranging from tanks, drops pods, to super heavies and trygons fit perfectly if you remove the unattached non-cartoned slab of foam. The minis don't move, and the case keeps them very, very secure. You can easily fit:2 dreadnoughts2 predators3 land speeders1 vindicatorand 2 rhinos insideAlso, you can take the non-cartoned foam and make customized troop holders, just as good as GW's holders!!"
2,Less than Average Case,"This case is alright. That is the best that I can say about it. It is very flimsy. I was expecting it to be a bit more durable...like the standard Plano tackle box. When the case is closed, it feels misaligned, as if it may come open at any minute. When the case is open, it's flimsiness is immediately evident. I would spend the money on something more rigid next time. It will serve it's purpose for the time being. Caveat emptor."
3,No pluck foam,"One reviewer said it had pluckable foam-mine did not. It is a low cost/value alternative for many-I'm using it for telescope eyepieces, but really wanted pluckable foam inserts."
4,Pretty good quality. Great price!,"I bought this case for a large handgun. There's more than enough room for the gun, its scope, my ear protection and some ammo. Be careful when you're pulling the foam out to fit it to your stored item. I made it a little wide so there's a little play inside around my gun when I carry the case. Otherwise, a real bargain!"
1,Flimsy and cannot lock it securely,"This box is flimsy which is in my expectation. It only has one off-center locking place which makes it impossible to lock it securely. For a box meant to store pistols, it should have a way to securely locking."
4,Pistol Case,"Great product. Wish it would close tighter against the gun's to keep them from shifting better but the foam isn't quite dense enough for that. All in all, as gun/pistol cases go it get's the job done."
3,Plano Protector Four Pistol Case,"Well constructed, although I would prefer a heavier material for the casing. The case actually fits three pistols ( 2 Ruger Vaqueros and a 1911 Semi Auto Pistol) a fourth would be too snug."
4,Pistol Case,This is a Nice Case for the price. I bought it as a Lightning Deal for cheap! I have nothing else to say.
4,Great value for the price,"This case is a great value. As mentioned by other reviewers, it is not a super rigid case. It has 2 sheets of convoluted foam, and 1 sheet of flat perforated foam that can be used to create cutouts.This case is great for transporting pistols to and from the range, or on trips where the are in your care the whole time. It does great at keeping the guns from banging around in the trunk of your car, for instance. I have taken several trips with it, and have not noticed the guns, magazines, or optics shifting at all.If, however, you have to ship the case when it would be out of your direct control, I do not think it is rigid enough to be thrown around by someone who does not care about it. While it can be locked, breaking the locking tabs off would be a trivial matter. As long as you don't expect this to be as durable as a $150 pelican, you should be very satisfied."
4,As Expected From Plano,"I own several Plano cases and was not disappointed with this latest 1404 case. They are high quality with great lockable latches. The two layers of foam in this case makes it very versatile. Only reason I didn't give it 5 starts is because it would be nice if there was foam on the inside edges. If you have really heavy items in it, they slide to the bottom when you pick the case up. It would be nice to have foam on the bottom edges to protect those items when they move. Lighter items don't move but a fully loaded pistol or, in my case, 33 round Glock mags fully loaded tend to move. Other than that, great case for the money and well worth it."
2,A cheap case with issues,"I picked this case up in order to fly several handguns home. I had to drill out the handle to accept a more substantial lock. I ended up using a brinks adjustable shackle lock straight through the handle. I loaded it up with 5 handguns in gun socks. TSA had no issue with the case as modified. It rolled out on the conveyor at my destination cracked completely through, bottom corner to case buckle and was missing a 1""x2"" chunk out of the bottom at that location. Seeing how it failed I would not recommend this case for hard use, the plastic used is just too brittle and the lock location is a joke. Invest a bit more in a better case. Plano has replaced the damaged case at no charge, which says a lot about their customer service."
1,Don't be cheap.,"Unfortunately, this case is not designed for pistols (no matter how they designate it). Squirt guns, yes. Real guns, no. Not a bad looking case online, but a flimsy, non-secure choice for pistols. Is it worth the price? Sure, I guess. Is it worth buying to carry guns? Not if you are serious about your weapons. Don't be cheap like me. Pay the extra bucks and get a case made for guns. If you do buy this, I hope you intend to use it as your kid's lunch box. That's all it's good for. Happy shooting!"
3,No more perforated foam?,"The item I received also did not have the perforated (pick-n-pluck) foam that was mentioned in the item description. I believe another recent reviewer mentioned the same thing. That was disappointing, however, I was able to make do with a little patience and a utility knife. The thing is, Walmart used to sell these things for just under $10, now they don't even carry them, and the price has doubled. Not quite the ""deal"" that these used to be."
4,Pistol cases,I ordered 2 cases to carry my SASS pistols in. I would never use it to to take guns on a airline flight that's why only 4 stars. For local carry and in the car it works great and meets all requirements for car transporting. I already had one case and liked it enough to order the two I just got.
1,need more foam,"This case is an absolute travesty. If you want to keep guns stored flat without ever lifting the case by it's handle it would be fine, but as soon as you pick up the case all your guns slide to the bottom and scrape against each other. Horrible, horrible, gun scratching, collectible destroying design. Ff the foam were just a bit thicker it would actuall HOLD guns in place. And heaven forbid you remove foam to pocket your guns in...that simply allows for more crash room in the case. 20 bucks going in the trash, OR another 20 for a second case just to have enough foam. Either way one case will be at the landfill."
2,Great... if you like your guns and mags in a pile...,"Cheap was what I was looking for, and unfortunately what I got. I figured it'd be inexpensive and a good value like other Plano cases I've bought for other purposes. I placed a couple of pistols and magazines in the case, closed it, picked it up and heard noise. Set it back down and opened it to find my pistols and magazines slouched to the hinge side of the case.Ok, so there is pick and pluck, but if you use that, you have only one layer, not the two advertised. Weak.I just bought a Seahorse instead, I've used that brand for my camera gear and trust it as much as Pelican."
1,Seriously?,"Seriously? $50 for a 50-page book? I just bought a Bourke's parrot, but it cost less than the book. Give me a break."
4,A whimsical and delightful book about Henry David Thoreau as an eccentric bear,"Henry Builds a Cabin is a delightful little book, that playfully riffs on themes from Henry David Thoreau's classic work ""Walden, or, Life in the Woods."" Henry decides to build a small cabin along the side of Walden pond, and his friends Emerson, Alcott and Lydia worry that it won't be big enough. He reminds them, gently, that there is space enough outside, and that we live narrow lives when we consider that we can only be at home when we are indoors and confined.The illustrations are nice, a whimsical variation on cubist style. What is most impressive is how simply the story is told and how much of Thoreau's character and background and thinking the author is able to pack into just a few easy sentences. Johnson is clearly well-versed in Thoreau's background, and clearly admires him -- and at the same time treats his story with a light and silly touch that is very appropriate for a children's book. Highly recommended."
1,"Not yet mine, but soon! HAHAHA","I am going to buy one of these on eBay tonight, and right now it is only ay $66! Too bad for you suckers who paid full price for one!"
1,YEA-RITE!!!!!!,"man I feal sorry for the one who got theres for $66.00 i would hav given mine to him mine broke the same day i got it, and wal*mart wouldent give me a re-found becou i threw away the box and stuff...........................OVER-ALL, this cam, is dead wieght. I boght it to film skateing with me and my friends, and it F#$%ed up the same day I was the damn laghing stalk for the day. so..... take my advise and get the {Samsung Hi8&#153; Camcorder- SAM SCL906} for $299.00 at circut city or www.circutcity.com"
2,Poorly Made,These filters are very poorly made.Out of the two that I ordered one needed to be re-soldered internally and the other disassembled and reassembled because the case improperly put together.I recommend going with the more expensive filters.Anything around ten bucks is usually pretty good.Dont try to save money by giving yourself this headache.It also did not help whatsoever with the noise on my CB from my trucks fuel pump.
5,"""Feel it in your soul""","I purchased Marie Claire D'Ubaldo's CD back when it was first released in 1994. It is by far one of my most cherished discs of all time. Every song on this album is rich, warm, exciting and full of life."
4,What can you say Krupa and Rich!,Gene Krupa and Buddy Rich on the same album! Blazing fast technically proficient drum solos from two of the masters of the era. If you love drum solos this is for you!
5,LOVE THOSE DRUMS,"GREAT LINE UP OF TALENT,AWESOME DRUM SOLOS, I JUST LOVE IT,TOOK IT TO MY FRIENDS TO SEE WHAT THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE BLOWN AWAY."
4,Content Would Be Helpful,"Your listing and the reviews provided do not include a listing of song to artist. On multi artist discs, this would be helpful in determining who performed what. Especially if you are looking for a performance by a specific artist."
5,Another must have for the Jazz Aficionado,"For every true Jazz lover there are must have albums for a real collection. Satch Plays Fats, The Summit Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong, etc.This album is another one. Generally when you think of Krupa and Rich what comes to mind are showman with talent but who just bang away on solo's. In this album you see the real talent to play with the best like Dizzy and Jacquet. I think however that Krupa really outshines Buddy on this album showcasing his jazz talent and not just the ability to bang away and show off.If only Barrett Deems and Cozy Cole could have done something like this then I would really have been happy!"
1,Terrible Quality/Assembly- Avoid this product.,"This product is awful. The wood quality is nice, and it is nice looking, but the quality of the assembly and the difficulty of assembly is totally unacceptable. Normally, I would expect this to be screwed together. In this case, you are actually DRILLING INTO THE WOOD! They supposedly provide pilot holes, but the pilot holes are rarely adequate to accept the screws that you need to screw into the wood, so you end up having to drill them yourself. Or, you can learn the hard way and strip some of the screws during the assembly. This product is a total ripoff!!Guidecraft, the manufacturer, has a phone number you can call for help. However, when you call, you'll find that you cannot get through to anybody. You sit on hold, and then get sent to a voice mailbox, which you cannot even leave a message on because the mailbox is full!Purchase this product at your own risk. Avoide Guidecraft for your toybox purchase."
3,Okay for the money.,"I suppose I expected something a little more uplifting than the music on this cd, so if you are looking for tangos that are not only good for dancing but good for listening, you may want to keep looking. I am a dance instructor, so I find it does come in handy when I need to practice or warm-up on my own, but trying to have a student practice a new or complicated move to the mid-tempo is a bit challenging. They do not provide for much variety, the songs, and all kind of run together, which does lend a hand in not being distracted when concentrating on dance. All in all, not spectacular, but does the job."
1,Title tallies to music samples,"Mon 27.12.2004 21:37The website music samples should tally with the music titles.Wrong tally makes for difficulty in hunting for the tune that I want.Please ignore the rating.Regards,Justin - Edinburgh"
5,Great advice from a great woman,"Rev. Laurie Sue married my husband and I on September 5, 2001 in Central Park. I knew she was an amazing woman the first time I met her. Much of what is in this book she told my hubby and I during our pre-ceremony meeting. The wedding ceremony she performed for us was as beautiful as anything I could've imagined. We were relaxed and truly enjoyed OUR day. Laurie Sue focused on the connection between my hubby and I. It made us feel empowered and strong. Having Laurie Sue marry us cemented the already strong bond we share. This book is very important to all brides. The focus of a wedding should be on the love and commitment between the bride and groom. Stress should be at a minimum. Laurie Sue's book gives great advice on keeping the priorities straight. I highly recommend this book!"
3,"""I'm Gonna Be Stong"" review","This is a mixture of Gene's hit songs and others that he has recorded in the past. He proves over and over again the versatility that his voice has. ""I'm Gonna Be Strong"" is a great song. He also does a really mean version of ""Born to Lose"". I never tire of listening to his voice."
3,"An expensive book, with pluses and minuses","I got some good ideas from the book, but I don't think they're worth either the $$ or the time it took to ferret them out. Now, I'm a life coach, not a financial advisor, so that may be part of the problem . . . BUT . . . Gregory refers readers to his tip-filled website and when you log on to it, there's no ""there"" there . . . no website, just the word that it will be coming along soon, and you can register to be kept up to date. He's also wedded to using the keyboard instead of a mouse, arguing that memorizing keyboard controls will cumulatively save you a lot of time. Again, maybe YES for financial advisors, but for a right-brained person, this is not helpful advice. So -- IMHO, the book is uneven. Browse at the library or a bookstore before buying."
5,How Strategists Think: Seasoned Insights for Using Technology in Marketing,"I've followed Kip's work for 10 years, and sought him out to teach entrepreneurs his methods when I ran training programs for the National Women's Business Center. He's a singular talent.Books and consultants that teach you how to use a single social media tool can only take you so far. Kip teaches you ""a higher level of theory"" in using technology in personal services marketing. Years before tools like twitter made social media all the rage, Kip was showing self-employed people how shrewd deployment of technological savvy could bowl over potential clients. He still has no equal.Learn the tools, yes, but learn how Kip thinks about them if you want to master the 24/7 networked space that is social media."
5,GREAT IDEAS,"A great book that can be picked up and read for 10 minutes, 1/2 hr, or more depending on the amount of time available. Pick the chapter from the Contents and go. I like the TIPS and the Web Links. Working more efficiently in this wired world is what its all about and this book gives you a lot of Great Ideas. The communication chapter was the best part of the book."
2,Well made but too small,"My daughter chose this messenger bag because of the print, but we hadn't realized it wasn't a regular size messenger bag. That was our mistake for not looking at the product dimensions, but it never occurred to me that a bag labelled as a ""messenger bag"" would be so small. She cannot fit her folders or homework book in it. We have found another use for it, but she was disappointed nonetheless."
2,It's tiny,It's tiny (cannot fit an 8.5x11 single subject notebook) and kind of cheap-looking. I've had other items from Jansport which had a much higher-quality fabric.
3,Know before you order,"When you view this item online on any site, it looks as if it's a nice size. Almost looks as if its able to fit a collage ruled notebook, but its not. The measurements might be accurate, but because the photo is blown up in size, it appears to be much bigger than it really is. It's always best when compared to something else. I've never been mislead by other products I've bought online, but this one looks like something a younger sibling would use. Don't me wrong, I'll more than likely still use it, under the circumstances that I bought it for my traveling, but I could have used a purse for the amount it holds, verses the impression I had. All in all, good bag, JanSport quality, just smaller then appears to be."
1,Basura,"I did the same thing as another reviewer. Saw a cute pattern and the words ""messenger bag"" and thought I had a new bag for school. This bag is the worst. Very flimsy. It holds nothing for my classes - doesn't even fit a notebook - and certainly isn't nice enough to use around town for an every-day bag. Unless you're, like, 12. Useless."
1,The men do not come with the shorts,"I blame Shirley for false advertising. When I saw this handsome set of shorts on the most gorgeous men ever, I thought they would come with the package. Instead all I received was a balding middle aged UPS guy with a stain on his shirt. Regardless, I still made him strip dance and put the shorts on. Not as satisfying, but when your an 82 year old grandmother you need something to alleviate the boredom. Great product if you can find the kind of guy who would look good in it."
4,Bought as a gift,"I bought this for my father. He is into the history of John D. Lee and Lee's Ferry. I had it shipped directly to him, so I didn't see it. But he says it was in great condition and that it hardly looked used. Thanks for the great price."
3,OKAY,"It was truely okay. The tape was Okay , Okay , Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, . there is nothing els to say. ART"
1,Pointless...,The dvd plays fine... but why anyone would want to watch this is beyond me. It was boring and fatally pointless. I didn't care enough about the characters to bother trying to follow or figure out the plot. And I'm not someone who only watches movies like Porky's Revenge. I followed Memento and loved it as well as other complex movies. But this... save your money. It doesn't get any worse IMHO.
1,random shutdowns,After installing this PS my systems suffered constant random shutdowns. System would not power back up until briefly removing AC from the PS. From what I've read this appears to be an ongoing problem with the Antec NEO HE series for at least a couple years. It is evidently still not fixed.Returned and ordered the Corsair HX520 instead.
4,An diamond in the rough but a diamond nonetheless,"One of my favorite NRBQ releases, probably one of the few that captures the live essence of the band. Mainly because it's goofy (Roll Call, Music Goes 'Round and Around), sweet (Never Take the Place of You, Beverly), and flat out rocking (Want You to Feel Good Too, Me and the Boys). All in all, one of the essential Q releases to have in your collection, a must have. If you're view of the band is limited to ""Me and the Boys"" and ""Riding in My Car,"" man, get a load of ""You Can't Hide."" and call me in the morning..."
2,For Collectors Only?,"This is far from being the best NRBQ album available. As the ""best bar band in the world"", they have made a series of loose but imaginitive and fun recordings. Later, when they tried to make ""serious"" recordings, some of the fun may have been missing, but this was made up for by top-notch writing and interesting arrangements. This project is neither tight nor fun. ""Me and the Boys"" is perhaps the only memorable song. The singing and playing are lacksidaisical, and overall it seems like the whole band would rather be elsewhere. You might want to skip this one unless you are a die-hard fan."
3,Using Colors,Cannot review this product because I do not know anything about it. I can only guess that these are more colors that can be used with Do-A-Dot books.
1,Stains! DO NOT BUY! NOT WASHABLE,Horrible Staining product. So upset it was used in my house. Be careful of the paintings your children bring home if they have used this paint. If the even get a drop of two of water they will bleed and stain!
3,about this music CD Homeland............,One album that contains music which is special in nature and in a mode of so special as if something new that make one wish to explore further. There are certain music there in this album worth the collection as a whole which I find that even though the price is high but is worth the collection. Recommended to those whom like New Age music by the label Narada by musician Eric Tingstad / Nancy Rumbel.N/B: The stock in amazon is almost all sold out and there is one more place to look for that is CDUnivwerse.comWritten by:Ang Poon KahBehind the scene Director 'Stallone' for film Expendables 2Director Ron Howard for film Da Vinci Code.
4,Off Kilter Folk Rock,"Now don't let the term 'folk rock' throw you away from this. Michael Hurley is awesome, but he's songs do tend to range from cool guy smooth (Midnight Rounder) to funny and weird (Pork Chop). But if you've heard any of his stuff (which has been featured in Deadwood) then you'll love this. I enjoy it a lot and am completely satisfied. It's a good listen."
5,for dummies,this book certainly does spell things out in simple form and provides a lot of valuable information particularly to those that don't know much about these birds.
5,Solid Help,"When I received two cockatiels from a rescue organization, my vet suggested I read this book. In a couple months, I was able to train my foster birds so that both were adopted. Very helpful."
3,Not really her best work,"Diane Grindol is, no doubt, a very nice person. However, I hear a lot of Diane and not so much useful, objective, and in depth advice about how to take care of cockatiels. She obviously loves her cockatiels and they are loveable birds, I'm with her on that.But imagine if the lady who wrote Pregnancy for Dummies, or the guy who wrote Cleaning Windows XP for Dummies took on the same sentimental tone?However, the book is very sweet. Personally I like it.Her section on illnesses is very informative. I have referenced it on several occasions.However, she does not really detail bird reproduction; she brushed it aside. She explains the body signals and mating calls, but she said it should not be encouraged.With other birds, mating can create complications, such as aggression, egg-binding, negligant parenting, etc. I wanted to know how likely these problems can arise with a pair of cockatiels.Maybe they don't ever arise?"
5,The Only Book You'll Ever Need,"This book is excellent for new cockatiel owners or a cockatielowner that wants an informative book. I really enjoyed reading it. Covers all the basic's, feeding, housing, colorings, taming all that you'll need to know. I highly recommend it!!!"
5,just what I was looking for,"Having owned many English Budgies, I recently took on a baby cockatiel. I had no idea how different they were, and needed some advice about handling, comfort spots, feeding, etc. This book has just what I was looking for....detailed enough to learn all that I need to know about forming a good relationship with Buttons! Perfect!"
4,book review,"fast shipping, excellant packaging, I bought the book with the intention of it having something to do with breeeding but there was nothing in there about it or how to take care of the young"
3,A great picture book....but lacking in credible information!,"As a dart frog breeder this is an awesome book to show people what different dart frog species look like. The pictures in the book are high quality, glossy and the animals he photographed are representative of the species. Every one I know who breeds Poison Dart Frogs has one (at least one) of his books - many of them have broken bindings from so much use.My fault with the book is with the accuracy of the information within the book. If you are interested in getting into dart frogs and learning how to breed them then get another book! Save your money and buy some of the less expensive books and scan the Internet for breeders and information. You will learn a lot more through this process than through the book. Much of the information isn't correct or is misleading.I recommend this book to everyone...but not for information or as a resource but as a 'coffee table book'!"
4,Awsome Book!!,I definitly like this book. Very informative and the photos have great color saturation.
2,Eugene Levy would put out a better album,"Listening to this album made me question my own life. It is simply unoriginal, boring and really bad. Save your money."
4,Not bad at all,"Pretty solid album, from a pretty solid band. Not everything sounds like coldplay so you can pretty much ignore that comparison, this is more pete yorn-esque? Pretty cash money."
1,i hate this,"This album sucks. The song are soooooooo boring. it's just like listening to cold play but even cold play being on drugs, because sometimes people don't do things as well when they're drunk or on drugs. So, if cold play was on drugs they would not play good music and they already suck and levy is like way worse than cold play so what that does that say about their music. It's just so bad. the guitar player needs to take more lessons, maybe from the lead guitar player from new found glory becuase he rocks. ok that's all.Jason Mitchell"
5,Coldplay comparisons? Really?,"I am really suprised with all the Coldplay comparisons. Apparently, people aren't able to descern the varios genres of music that is out there. This band obviously fits under the ""shoegazer"" genre that came out of the 80's and 90's from bands like Jesus and the Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine, The Verve, etc... Levy even displays the typical ""wall of sound"" you would find with other shoegazing bands! Not to add completly devoid of all the various layers and polished sounds you would expect from a band like Coldplay. This c.d. is completly underated, and not at all boring, the lyrics are amazing. This c.d. deserves a listen, especially for those who appreciated 80's alternative, or generally drift from one daydream to the next."
2,Middle of the Road Mediocrity...,"With so many rip-off acts out there these days, Coldplay being one of the biggest offenders (in my opinion)... it's a shame to find a band that is copying off of a copier... Coldplay. That's not to say there aren't any original themes at all on this record, but the overtones of pop music riffs and subject matter dominate.The high point is the title track, Rotten Love, where they find a bit of success and find a sound of their own, to create a decent slow MOR ballad, perfect for mix radio or possibly even college radio listeners.A Coldplay fan would probably like this album, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone searching for a bit of substance in their music."
4,Come on...Coldplay?,"Apparently you can't have a lead singer that sounds ANYTHING remotely like Chris Martin or you will be a considered a band that is 'copying a copier'. Come on! This is almost a concept album, and the album title explains it all. That right there differentiates them from Coldplay.It has guitars, a male lead singer, and it is 'pop'. That's about all you can say ties them to Coldplay. This album has actual substance, something that Coldplay does not have. Without sounding pretentious, listening to this album is like going through a breakup. My favorite album of the year? Nope, but it's a solid CD that I listen to when the right mood strikes me.Also, I love how people are so judgmental of Coldplay. They have some catchy tunes. Coldplay is the exact kind of band that all of the cool indie kids would love if they weren't popular. Do they have some terrible songs? Yep, but almost every band does. The only reason they get so much hate is because they are popular."
2,A Little Disappointed,"I was given this CD from my sister, who knows I love to dig into up and coming bands. I was not impressed. The only song I found to be fairly original, in at least the sound, was In the Woods, which I wouldn't list as the fulcrum this album turns on. The remainder of this album disappointed me with its appeal to emotion that was trying a little too hard (as is the style these days), hammering out repeated chords and vocals that have that familiar deep delicate sound. Now, I don't like Coldplay. I don't have any of their albums. I hate to say this, but it almost sounds like Levy is really trying to pull off some Coldplay covers. Make sure you listen to the samples before you buy this CD, because I'd hate for someone to accidently buy A Rush of Blood to the Head Part II."
5,Two of the most famous Hot Rods ever!,"Great movie, but the cars are the real stars! A black '55 Chevy & '32 Ford! Just plain cool!"
2,"So much potential, so little entertainment","Well, I just watched both of these movies, back to back. And I have to say I was really disappointed in both. There was so much potential for them both to be exciting as well as informative and musically captivating, but both fell short. Way short. The first was nothing but a bunch of kids riding up and down the streets all night long, obviously out of boredom, and only creating more boredom, to good music that was always too far in the background. The second movie followed them as they progressed into the 60s era, and this time in three or four separate and completely chopped up scenarios, and again with good 60s music that was not pronounced enough to bring back many memories to the viewer.I'm actually sorry I didn't just watch them on cable and forget them. Neither are movies I would want to watch again - unless I was having trouble sleeping."
2,"Good movie, but a little disappointing!",I have seen the first American Graffiti and I liked it! But this movie is just about the New Year's Eve in the 60's and Vietnam. It doesn't even compare with the first one. I thought it was going to be like more greasers and alot funnier. This movie wasn't even funny. It is still a great movie but it's nothing like the first. I got a little disappointed that Richard Dreyfuss wasn't in it. It was also hard trying to find Harrison Ford but he is in this one. Anyways I guess if you liked the first one you would like this one but not as much. The first one is the best. Don't rent this movie because you will be a little disappointed.
3,LESS WOULD OF BEEN MORE,"IF YOU ARE NOT A FAN OF THE FIRST MOVIE YOU WILL HATE THIS! UNLIKE THE FIRST MOVIE THAT TOOK PLACE IN ONE NIGHT IN THE SUMMER OF 1962, THIS TAKES PLACE OVER 4 DIFFERENT NEW YEARS EVE! THE STORY THAT WORKS THE BEST IS STEVE AND LORI'S STORY! SHE WANTS TO WORK AND HE WANTS HER TO BE A STAY AT HOME MOM! THE OTHER'S ARE STILL WATCHABLE! IT HAS BEEN OVER 20 YEARS SINCE THIS MOVIE HAS BEEN MADE AND I MUST SAY THE STORY OF STEVE AND LORI (RON HOWARD AND CINDY WILLIAMS) WILL TRIGGER BELLY LAUGHS! THE STORY OF DEBBI (CANDY CLARK) HAS ITS MOMENTS! LOOK FAST IN HER STORY FOR HARRISON FORD. THIS MOVIE NEEDS TO BE WATCHED ON THE DVD WIDESCREEN FORMAT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE DIRECTOR'S VISION ON WHAT HE WANTED TO DO WITH EACH STORY!"
1,american graffiti/more american graffiti (drive-in double feature),both sides of this dvd skip so badly it is unwatchable.unfortunatly i lost my receipt before viewing this piece of crap.i would advise other customers to think twice before purchasing the franchise collection version of these two movies.
1,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE PICTURE QUALITY!!,"I attempted to watch this DVD on my Samsung 52"" LCD TV using my Samsung 1080 upscaling DVD player. Most DVDs play at near blu-ray quality on my system, however, this DVD quality was not even the equal of an average VHS picture. Futhermore, the ""widescreen"" display only occupied about 2/3 of my screen (Who knows? It may have looked worse if it had taken the whole screen!). I gave up after trying to watch for about 15 minutes."
1,"The First One is Better,Except for the drag racing A Classic is ruined and Politicized.","More American Graffiti is a sad Sequel with the exception of More Drag Racing and cool cars and Wolfman Jack it makes a Mockery and ruins the franchise(Typical Lucas and Howard and their Politics.)There are some funny parts where in 'Nam the guy is incompetent but overall it is tasteful the Whole 'Nam added in as if to make a statement and then you have the losers from SadFranciso(pun intended Sad)and their little Che and Lenin Posters in the background,you do not know whether the film makers are condoning it or regretting it(I am sure the former).Overall,a Movie that has nothing to do with Cars and growing up and more of a statement from the many UNAMERICAN Canadian Bound Draftdodgers and draftcard burners who do not represent America as a whole or it's opinion."
3,Many people never heard of this sequel,"This movie picks up a few years after the famous American Graffiti ended, and follows the same cast of characters from the original during the turbulent Vietnam era. All the same actors are back except John Dreyfus. Using a unique series of split screens, often times they show the action going on in different places or from differing vantage points. They have all moved on and the movie captures each persons story individually. The focal point for each character concerns events in their lives surrounding a crucial mid 60's New Year. While not quite the feel good movie like the original- it continues the story and follows the events of the mid 60's."
4,more american graffiti,Well the only reason i give this movie a 4 star is because it lets you know where everything ends up (which is exactly what it sumed up at the end of the first movie) This movie is a far cry from the first. NO 55 chevy and the 32 coupe is always parked in this one. It is worth seeing once to see what happens from the first but not going to be one of my faverate movies
2,No surprises in the sequel. Not much of anything,"More American Graffiti was exactly what I figured it would be.A movie made that doesn't break new ground, but instead uses it as a foundation to make money for the cast, crew,caterers, etc. Good for them, bad for most of us.I will admit I am sequel bigot"" with a deep abiding resentment against exploiting an original ideal which was the classic ""American Graffiti""I bought the second one so I could ""have the complete set.""But the two don't make a set. The magic of the original is gone for the most part, great actors (Paul Lemat, Ron Howard) are going through the motions waiting for payday. What this--and most--sequels do is stain the memory of its original to the point of sacreligious. With few exceotions,avoid films with ""2"" or ""More"" in the title. ""More American Graffiti"" issimply more money for the producers."
3,Nothing like as enjoyable as the original,"My wife and three kids sat down and watched American Graffiti (5 stars) then after a 20 minute interval we watched More American Graffiti. Initially pleased to see the characters a few years on but then the problems started. The plot kept jumping back and forth zig zagging to the end which fortunately was faithful to the original. Unlike the original which covered 24 hours, this film tries to cover three separate episodes of time; perhaps if the Director kept the plot chronological then it might have been easier to follow and leave the future still in front of us. Instead we are left somewhere back in the middle. It's almost Back to the Future but stuck in third gear."
2,very choppie on one side,side b skips throw out the movie. next time i will need to ask before i order the next one
5,returns,"shipping was fast,but the dvd was in bad condition.I sent it back for a replacement and waiting for a reply.."
2,No where near the Original,"If you like the original. You may be disapointed. I was. I wanted to see a real continuation. What I got was meany hard to follow snips. I think the director could not get them all in one place again. So, they wrote small movies for each."
2,Not as Good as the Original!!!,More American Graffiti is kind of sad to me. It shows how everone is living in 3 or 4 time zones. It's sad that Terry the toad's girlfriend forgets him and becomes a hippie. The ending is the most sad because you know John Milner is about to die because of a drunk driver. I probably wouldn't recommend MORE AMERICAN GRAFFITI!!!
1,Terrible Movie,"American Graffiti was a great movie, the sequel is terrible, I wish I had never bought it and wasted my money."
3,unrealistic,"I lived through that era including a tour in Vietnam. The military scenes are totally unrealistic. People do stupid things that would get them killed. They have unrealistic attitudes. They are not following what they should have learned in basic training. The main character is a warrant officer, yet he is always doing duties usually done by privates.The video, 84 Charlie Mopic, which is available here on Amazon is much more realistic, but still has a few flaws."
1,amer graffitti review,this dvd lasted about 20 minutes and then stopped never mad e it through the whole movie once....
5,American Graffiti/more American Graffiti,This will remain a classic as long as it is viewable. Great movie Quality cast
3,American Classic,I really like the first American graffiti. Street racing- suped up cars... American classic cars... Just shows how much the typical cruise meant growing up. Just to be able to get out and have fun. Plus following Toad's character... very entertaining!The second- More American Graffiti however... I turned the movie off after 15 minutes. Kept jumping between the characters and the was no story line to it...
5,Great followup to the first movie.,More American Graffiti answers a lot of questions that first one had us wondering about. Another great performance by Candy Clark. Paul Le Mat showed great maturity in his role for the second film.
4,movie,"Movie was all I epected and more, the extras that came with the movie provided great inside thoughts of how the movie was made, and the actors inner thoughts as well"
3,Reliving Yesterday,It is an okay video but not near as good as the original. Needed more music of the era. Acting was ok but I feel there was more originality in the first movie.
5,It works.,"Normal key-fob size, works from pretty reasonably far away, easy to program (just push the 'Learn' button on the side of the opener and then push the button on the remote)."
3,Linear Keychain transmitter,"Could only program one of the 4 units. Each time I would program a second unit, it would cancel out the previous."
5,Great product for my Linear Garage Door,Arrived quick and in good shape. Had to get on a ladder to get to garage door motor. Instuctions for me were this: Press and hold the button for remote then press and hold the learn button on the motor. I did not have to take off the cover of my motor as it was clearly labled on the motor box. Release the learn button for the motor but continue to hold button for the remote for about 30 sec. it should learn the code. I held the remote right up to the learn button just in case it needed really close proximity. Hope this helps.
5,Good Value,"Looking for something different besides the typical garage door opener that hangs from your visor. This one was small and can detach from your key chain. Was worth the money, no to mention was fairly cheap."
5,Excellent product,"I love this garage remote. It works perfectly, was easy to set up, and is handy to have on my key chain!"
5,an excellent resource,"This book is an excellent resource for teaching science content to young students. It has wonderful photographs and the text is simple and concise. In addition, it is an excellent book to use to teach primary students about the features of non-fiction. It contains a table of contents, an index, a map and captions. The only shortcoming is that is not available in big book format!"
2,A good camcorder but........,"I purchased one of these last year and although I can't complain about the quality of the picture, the service from Panasonic leaves a whole lot to be desired.My camcorder was accidently bumped about 8 months after I purchased it which caused the deck assembly and loading assembly to become unworkable. Even though the fault was mine, Panasonic doesn't seem to want you to have their products repaired, they would rather you buy another one, as the repair technician stated to me. The parts cost more than the camcorder did new.Needless to say I will never buy another Panasonic product again and neither will my friends and family."
3,It worked great until it stopped working....,"I baught this camera around october and it is now august, and for some odd reason a couple weeks ago, it broke. i have no idea why, i wasn't being rough with it or anything, i'm sure i didn't bang it.for one, the loading part would'nt work but my dad somehow managed to shove the tape in (i have no clue how because he can't do it anymore) and when he did it wouldn't record, play, or anything else!other than the fact that, its a nice camera."
4,One additional note - for those who miss Lowell....,"Discovered 'The Q' quite by accident, tryin' to chase down a kicky li'l tune from a car commercial (hence, Ridin' In My Car!)...and must say I'm quite pleased that the Fates dealt me that hand. Br'r Finkel's review above says good a'plenty, & I couldn't hope to improve on that....but find one odd shortcoming - not so much with his review but, in the overall content here about NRBQ. Haven't read it all, so of course it might be there & I've just missed it, but I see no comparison to Little Feat! For those who miss the soulful creations of Lowell George & crew, give these boys a try -- they's about the closest thing to come down the pike since the true Dixie Chickens crossed the road to the shark tank. RIP Lowell....we love & miss ya! *ribit* Shut...UP! ~8)~J-Hi"
3,Just average,"Though I find this book about average, I am still glad I bought it. The stories in this book, seem to be more about good samaritans, making a difference in peoples lives, than angelic interventions. that said, I certainly found the book uplifting, if only little dry."
4,Angels in our Backyards,This book shows us that there are everyday angels everywhere. We just have to realize and be open to them.
5,GREAT READ on the true Existence on Angels,"As the past proprietress of an Angel Store, we sold this book by the truck load. This book is one of the greatest books ever published about the true existence of angels walking beside us. Ms. Wester Anderson writes with authority, and conviction, and with great style that keeps the reader interested in this intriguing subject. All reviews of this book by my clientelle were very positive. To this day, I still pull this great read from the shelf of my personal library. It gets a 10 from me."
5,eminently listenable,The CD is pure joy from start to finish.The music carries a sense of adventureand possibility. Not really any dud cuts.
3,"Islands, an early but nice effort","This was an early David Arkenstone CD, back in the fairly generic New Age heading. Some hints of David's amazing musical ideas can be heard here, especially in the amazingly beautiful songs Passage and The Palace. The rest feels to me like filler, compared to his later works. Still very much worth purchasing on these two songs alone.your mileage may vary and every song would hit you. This is my own feel about it. Still a very much recommended CD."
4,Anthony Wilson's Recording SAVIVTY.,I have listened to other recordings by Anthony Wilson and as with this and the others they are very enjoyable. I do look forward to hearing more (future as well as past that I have not yet heard) from this artist. Thank you.
4,Honor Thy Father,"A Little Bit slow and Boring at times but I think sadly underrated,While I don't care for Brenda Vaccarro(I can't stop thinking of SNL Cheri Oteri And Will Ferrell Morning Latte,I got brenda Vaccarro Next to me.) It can't be compared to the Inaccurate and Over the Top Godfather(What Cuban in history has ever blown himself up?and typical stereotypes)But it is worth watching even if it seems like a Bad TV Movie,there are some faces which later on are seen In The Sopranos and Mob Films and Typecasted as Such.I Saw this On netflix and it is not great but it is decent and goes to show the Story of Joe Bananas and the war between the Families over control and The Bonnano Family.Worth Watching."
5,Excellent Crima Drama!!,"This 1973 Movie starring Joeseph Bologna,Brenda Vaccaro tells about the rise and fall of the Bonnano Family.It's an excellent crime drama!!"
3,"Reliable tuner, mediocre video quality from RF input, dead-end product","I have been quite happy with the reliability of the tuner (it doesn't fail and miss shows like some others I have tested). The video quality isn't great, particularly for channels that are noisy to begin with. Its drivers can sometimes have issues when installing and I have been told there will never be Vista support (the MCE 2005 drivers partly work on Vista - but you get only one of the two tuners)."
3,Game is fun but is too long for what it is,"Rampage is a classic series no matter what anyone says. But Rampage 2 Universal Tour isn't that much different than the previos Rampage World Tour. Granted yes, there are new boards, new challenges (from both mankind and outer space!) and you do get to use new Mutants but when it all comes down to it, the game gets a little repitive after a while which always makes a game boring.That and this game was really long, and if you had the Continue option, I couldn't find it and that's another dimension that made this game too difficult for what it was. I won't deny that I had fun while I played but after a while, it seriously goes out of normal rotation.I loved the fact that you (like the last one) could rampage with 2 of your friends and wreak havok on the world but still, I would make this a renter first before you committed to buy. I'm not saying it's not worth to buy but I am saying that you could easily get tired of this after a weekend or two."
1,It S**ked big time!,"The graphics were crummy and the plot was so dumb that Saturday Morning Cartoons are better. The game S**KED, period"
5,Awesome Game!,"Rampage Universal Tour is a great game. Universal Tour introduces a story line similar to that of Rampage World Tour. The three original monsters, Lizzie, George, and Ralf, have been captured by Earth's forces, George is being held captive in America, while Lizzie is in Aisa, and Ralf is in Europe. Now, it's up to a new team of monsters, Certus, Boris, and Ruby, to save them, and also unravel the mystery of Aliens that have come to Earth, and the brother of Lizzie- Myukus. This game is all about destroying city after city all across the world, and the cool thing about this game is, that you can travel to different planets. Loving the original Rampage World Tour myself, I have nothing bad to say about Rampage Universal Tour. If you enjoyed Rampage, or Rampage World Tour, this is the game for you."
4,Gotta love continuity.,"Video transfer was pretty good for such an old cartoon, but the audio transfer on 4 of the episodes is plagued with chronic hissing. My ears and speakers couldn't wait for the episodes to end. Overall though, good DVD. It was fun to see the first episode had all the characters driving on the right side of the car, then had them changed over to the left side of the vehicles for all other episodes."
5,I mis-read the title,"I mis-read the title of the DVD as being the first season of M.A.S.K., not Volume 1. However, the 5 episodes on the DVD are in excellent condition. The first episode, The Deathstone, has been transferred with the film backwards (the people are driving in the passenger side seat, their hair is parted on the wrong side, etc.) but the quality of the animation (video) and sound are still great. The other four episodes were transferred correctly and the video/sound are great on those as well. My brother and his family were recently over for a visit, and his kids watched this DVD while here. They are 14 and 11 years old, and they both told me that it was the coolest cartoon they had ever seen, and the look on their faces when I told them how old the cartoons were was priceless!! Even then, they still when on the rest of the day about the different cars, masks, etc. I'd highly recommend this DVD to anyone who was a fan of the show, or just loves cool cars!"
3,"Good... Flawed, but nostalgic","This DVD is a decent collection of episodes. The transfer is not the best, but these are 80's cartoons, so they don't have much to work with. The audio hisses like crazy. I have no idea why I was so big into this cartoon, it's actually kinda bad, but it's nostalgic. It's fun to remember all the toys that I bought like a dumb American consumer. :) If you want M.A.S.K. on DVD, this is your only shot, so it's ""awesome"" I guess. If you simply like 80's cartoons, there are better out there."
4,No built-in sequencer,"Just a note after I received this keyboard from Amazon - despite what the Amazon page says, this keyboard does not have a built-in sequencer to record your own songs. For that you'll have to pay a bit extra and get the PSR280 61-Note keyboard.Otherwise, the keyboards seems solid, the majority of the sounds are realistic and the speakers sound great."
3,Not what I thought it would be.,"Received delivered by hand in a plastic garbage bag. Very dirty, keys had glue and dirt on them, took some time to get them clean. Very dusty too. Unit seems to work OK, but not what was described."
5,response to 'a music fan' in regards to Live At the Quick,"OK, 'a music fan', what would you suggest would make this album better? This is the first time in over 20 years I've ever publicly ranted about music, but I'm compelled to do so now. I see that you have some good taste in music, so what is it about this album that you find unpleasing? The musicians on this album are some of the best on their instruments in the world, if not the best, and boy, if you could do better, let's hear it. You're welcome to reply, but let's remember to keep it polite."
4,"Better than the studio ""outbound"", which has same songs","Bela Fleck and the Flecktones have a ""big band"" concert which rehashes many of the songs on the ""Outbound"" studio CD. The live disc, I feel, works better because it has more spirit. Even though there are a lot of guests with different styles, it all works together fine because the guests, frankly, aren't prominent in the mix. You have to listen closely. One notable exception is Ondar's exceptional Tuvan throat singing on ""Alash Khem"", which he does solo. If you're deciding between ""Outbound"" and this one, pick this one. If you already have ""Outbound"", your decision will hang on just how much you like the Flecktones!"
1,WARNING! NOT for HV20,"Amazon now (4/26/07) has this linked with the Canon HV20 Camcorder, both as a ""buy these togather"" and listing this in the accessories section under the HV20.Everything I see, including Canon web site and email from Canon support, is that this is incorrect. The HV20 needs the BP-2L14 not a BP-214. ( The longterm solution is for Canon to be more sensible with their part numbers. ) But for now I suggest anyone research this before going for Amazon's suggestion for this for an HV20."
2,stopped working first time i used it,"I bought this to power my pellet stove in case of power outage. Well the power went out, I connected it to this unit and it only ran about 1 1/2 hours and the battery was dead! The power unit was plugged in and charging for over a week before I needed to use it. So much for ""running for 50hrs"" as stated in the description........"
3,Okay for small stuff,"Got this Xantrex in anticipation of hurricane Irene. Unboxed this powerpack and first thing I noticed is the LCD display did not work at all. I could not tell whether it was charging or working or anyting. Unbelievable. I left it plugged in for 24 hours hoping that it was taking the charge. Irene hit and electricity went out. This device worked well for powering up small stuff like iPhones, Macbooks, jambox and running a 60 watt light. however, when I plugged in my very Small coffeemaker, it didn't work ... wouldn't charge. My only real disappointment is the failure of the LCD display - I could not tell if the unit was charging, I could not tell how much juice was left in the battery as I ran it, etc."
5,Gets the Job Done,"I got this for temp power if i lose electricity, I had it for a week and the power went out, i ran a fan, laptop and cell phone off it for a few hours to finish up my work.Did exactly what i bought it for."
1,Worthless,"I bought this a little less than 2 year ago, and used it once a year. It worked fine when I first bought it, but after that it would not hold a charge. After 6 months warranty is ineffective. This last time I plugged in a string of LED lights with less than 5 watts, and it lasted for 7 min. completely worthless product."
1,Doesn't work,"The digital readout doesn't work, and the machine won't hold a charge. The company won't repair or replace. I bought this for my father-in-law for Christmas, and it was a waste of money. Unfortunately, he didn't try it out until after the 90-day return period."
2,Xantrex 852-2000 XPower Powerpack 600HD Portable Battery,"I was disapointed. I had hoped it would hold a charge for a lot longer, but it didn't. I used this in a craft booth to light 4 strings of Christmas lights and a tree. It only lasted about 4 - 5 hours. When the battery began to run low, it ""Buzzed"" really loud.I wish I had picked the bigger one."
1,Overrated,"I bought this, with the hope that it would be able to jump start my car if needed. I had been having some battery problems, so I bought this. I charged it as the directions indicated in the User's Guide directed, then I checked it and it displayed 100% full. I needed to jump my battery and I followed the directions in the User Guide, and it would not work. The light came on on the powerpack, BUT it would not jump start my car. I returned it, and will try another one. I might have gotten a defective unit, and I realize that, but I will not be buying another one of these from Xantrex."
1,Fool me once,I had an old Xantrex which I had for 3 years and used a number of times. The jack from the a/c plug corroded and wouldn't charge anymore. I figured maybe it was because I left it plugged in all the time. I bought this one in Oct 2007 and never used it except to see if the features were working. Now when it is plugged in the alarm keeps ringing all the time.I never should have come back for seconds. I see Sears has a die hard one.I am going to look into it. At least Sears backs their products.
4,Good in a Pinch,"A recent power outage this Summer convinced me to look into somekind of emergency power. Needing something to be able to run some fans, the Xantrex powerpack looked like a good idea for that need. I've charged it and have even tested it out. No complaints from me. It does what it is supposed to do."
1,"Good idea, bad broduct","I have owned this for about 4 months and have had to send in 2. On the first, the readout didn't work, then on the second, the charger died after using it once. The readout doesn't work on the third, but I figured what's the use? I tried calling xantrex to see why there are so many problems, but getting their customer service is impossible. When it works, it's great, but doesn't have nearly the operating time that it says. Also, the radio might as well not even be there since the reception is so bad with the battery working. Amazon is great in exchanging this, however, and I give them 5 stars."
4,It beats freezing in the dark!,"I bought the Powerpack to power the fan/blower in our gas fireplace during a power failure. Heavenly!! It must be used judiciously -not continuously- but it was a lifesaver during a recent snowstorm. There is no heat delivery system in the house which does not require electricity except the impractical (and unsafe) kitchen oven. It did the job I bought it for, and it gave us reading lights as well! I have since purchased a second unit."
4,Very useful and handy,"I bought this power source for a field test. It worked very well and was very handy. I wish the power can last a little bit longer. The charging time is a little bit too long. If you want to use it in consecutive days, the battery won't be fully charged from the second day if you used it up in the first day. Otherwise it is good."
2,I'll think twice about buying Xantrex again.,"I used my 600HD only a few times before the display stopped working. It was never subjected to water or anything out of the ordinary.The foreigner I just got off the phone with tells me there is no way to fix this.I'm sorry, but why would Xantrex sell high tech products that cannot be repaired?"
2,600 watts rating is misleading,"Beware! Per the product brochure, this unit will only support 600watts for 5 minutes. It only has a 480watt constant rating!"
2,Readout Never Worked ;-(,"I've had this product for about a year. The readout that tells you how much charge is left never worked!When I first got the product, the readout didn't seem to work according to the directions, but it took me some use to figure out it didn't work properly. I could find out how much charge was left, but it didn't display the info as the directions stated. The item is so heavy and bulky, I decided not to bother returning it and just live with the inconvenience. . .Now, after three or four camping trips worth of use, the readout doesn't work at all! There's no way to find out how much charge the unit has remaining. I just have to find out when it dies. Not very convenient at all."
2,Maybe great for back-up power - but not as a jumpstarter.,"I purchased it primarily as a jumpstarter for my classic VW...and secondarily as a backup power sourse in case of hurricane etc. It may work well for the latter - but after getting it, charging it for 3 days, and trying to jump my car - it would barely turn it over and was dead after 3 tries. Back to a $75 Battery Charger/Jump Starter for me."
1,nice when it worked,worked great the 3 times I used it but after a week long trip it refused to recharge so now a great paperweight but very pricy for the 3 times I used itsadly it just out of warrety
5,Exceeded My Expectations!!!,"Wow! I charged the unit for a couple days, (as suggested by one review) rather than just till the light went green and this morning hooked it up to a powered QSC K-12 speaker (amp is rated at 1000 watts) and a walkman CD player. I ran this for OVER 7 HOURS at a significant volume, about 50-75% of max. It was quite loud. I'm a DJ and intend to use this battery to power this set-up for wedding ceremonies. I was hoping to get an hour and a half and medium volume, but to have it go 7 hours!! Wow! There's some headroom. It exceeded my expectations by a mile, and I can't say that about too many things"
4,Good light camping power supply,"I use a CPAP machine for sleep apnea and have wanted a portable power supply to enable me to use a tent for camping. This product more than meets my needs, powering the CPAP plus a small 20W ventilation fan overnight to make tenting possible again and comfortable. I also plan to use it to power my CPAP during occasional outages at home -- a good and inexpensive solution."
1,"Save your money, don't fall into this trap","Don't waste your money on this. I've had mine for a year, taken good care of it, and yet it will only power ONE fan for 30 minutes. I tried my coffee maker: NO. Tried a small fridge: NO. In short, it's useless, save your money and try something else."
1,Somebody Help,"I have nothing but trouble with the battery company that sent the power pack 600HD. I have never been able to charge it because of a defective charger. They cannot send me a replacement because they do not have one. They want me to pay full postage to send back the defective charger. They offered me a choice of replacement or junk and refund. I chose junk and refund since it is impossible to send such a heavy thing back at my cost. I bought this in August and have not received a refund, am being charged with interest, and have a $325 item I cannot use. When I called ""Mark"" he told me I was unreasonable to talk to and to call back when I calmed down. HELP. I only want to charge what I think would be a good battery to take camping or stop charging me and calling me unreasonable."
1,DOESN'T HOLD A CHARGE,"BOUGHT THIS AND ONLY USED IT TWICE. I FIRST TRIED TO PLUG MY LAPTOP INTO IT WHILE DEER HUNTING AND IT WOULD ONLY LAST AN HOUR. SHOULD HAVE RETURNED IT THEN, BUT LIKE A FOOL, I KEPT IT. SINCE THEN IT HAS BEEN PLUGGED IN JUST WAITING TO BE USED AGAIN. AS THE RUMORS GET HOTTER FOR AN EMP ATTACK FROM IRAN, I HAVE BEEN GETTING THINGS IN ORDER JUST IN CASE THIS EVENT SHOULD HAPPEN. SO, I TOOK THE POWERPACK AND ONCE AGAIN HAD NO LUCK WITH IT EXCEPT ONE THING; THE LIGHT WILL WORK FOR A LONG TIME PLUS THE RADIO WORKS BUT THAT'S IT. CONTACTED SELLER TO TO IF HE (GENE) HAD ANY RECOMMENDATIONS BUT NO REPLY BACK. I CAN THINK OF OTHER THINGS I WOULD RATHER WASTE MY MONEY ON LIKE THINGS THAT WORK. WITH THAT SAID-BUYER BEWARE!"
1,Is this new or refurbished?,"Kinda odd that the sales price is almost half what other resellers are charging, and that a search on Nextag says its a refurb."
2,Looks and Features Can be Deceving!,"From the way it looks and all the features it promises, the Xantrex Powerpack 600 appears to be a well thought-out design. However looks and features can be deceiving! My Powerpack lasted less than nine months from the day of purchase. It became completely dead and there was no way to recharge the battery after a couple of initial uses. I had bought many items on Amazon before but I had never been disappointed until I bought this Xantrex PowerPack. Sadly, it was a big waste of money."
5,Don't sit in the dark (while waiting for FEMA to come),"I just obtained one of these from Amazon as a simple backup power source. We don't get a lot of power failures here in our Manhattan apartment but they are tough when they happen. A generator is not an option. Aside from the obvious operating exhaust issue, it is dangerous and illegal to keep fuel in an apartment in New York City.In a test last week the unit powered a 13-watt, 110-volt compact flourescent lamp for 22 hours---enough to keep a room lit for three evenings with about the same light output as a 60-watt incandescent light bulb.I figure it can also charge my DVD player battery a few times as well. For the rest--battery powered little TV, radio, flashlights, wired telephone, even candles are on hand. We'll manage okay for awhile.It can be recharged from a solar panel and from a lighter socket (""Hey, taxi!"").I like this thing a lot. It is easy to move and operate and takes up very little room. It is much, much better than nothing."
4,Easy jumpstarts,"First of all, don't buy this model. Get the ""Duracell"" version. It is the exact same unit with different decals, but it's $70 cheaper. You would be a sucker to get this one.If you are buying this thinking that you will use the ""display screen"" or radio then you're in for a suprise. These extra features are very cheap (broken from the start). The light seems to be the only useful extra feature. This all seems to be outweighed by the fact that this does its job well. This will jump a V8 with a dead battery with no problem, and faster than jumper cables will. I have used this 6-8 times to jump a V8 on one charge.If you simply want something for jumping a car or suv anywhere fast, easy, and reliable then this is it."
1,Xantrex 600 discontinued!!!,"In March, 2012 I purchased A Xantrex 600 Powerpack that is discontinued and I was not told that it was so. Finding parts is nearly impossible!"
1,Item won't charge,"I charged this battery for 2 days when first I bought it and tested it with a few small items... like the night light and small electronics. It worked !! I put the battery in my car for a road emergency. 3 weeks later when I need to jumpstart a friend's car, it did not have the power. I checked the power and it was zero. I went home and charged it until it showed 100%. 2 Days later, I checked the power and it was zero.NOW the battery would not recharge. The power was at 0 level but I could turn on the radio and emergency light so I turned them on to drain the power hoping I could recharge the battery. 5 days later the light and radio stopped and it still would not recharge.I passed the 30-day return policy so I could not return it back ! THIS IS A PIECE OF JUNK!!"
1,Xantrex has seriously bad quality control!,"On the first of these units I ordered, the display for the clock/radio unit didn't work. I returned it and Amazon sent me another one. On the second unit I received, the power meter was broken. It would display 0 watts no matter what was plugged into the inverter. The display function button also wouldn't toggle the display, so the battery charge % never showed. I am currently waiting for my third unit to arrive.Why did Amazon even start selling this lousy product? The quality control over at Xantrex is clearly dismal, if not nonexistant. One bad product I can believe was a slip-up, but two in a row suggests that their manufacturing process needs to be reexamined.Save yourself a headache and buy a power pack from a different manufacturer."
5,Back up power source,This is a great product. We bought it as a back up power source to our generator for hurricane season. There is an LCD screen that tells you how much power you are using which is very useful when deciding what to plug in and power up! The only down side is that you have to charge the unit every three months or so to keep it running smoothly when you need it.
1,Defective,I had the Xantrex Powersource 1800 and it worked ok for 6 months then wouldn't charge so I returned it. I decided I needed a battery backup so I purchased the Xantrex Powerpack 600 and just out of the box it wouldn't charge or light up the LED light indicating it was trying to charge. I thought it might be the power cord so I got a new power cord and it still wouldn't charge. I starting to feel that Xantrex doesn't Test their products before they distribute them. I would rate it zero stars but one star is for Amazon and their return policy.
4,Double The Van Dammage!,"Jean-Claude Van Damme was making the best of his films in the beginning to the middle of the 90's.Death Warrant started out his action hero character and after that hit box offices Van Damme went full throttle in a number of other great action adventures.So we come to Double Impact,a film directed by Van Dammes long time buddy Sheldon Lettich.Two Van Dammes are always better than one,but now in 2003 if an action star duplicates himself,it's just downright stupid,action audiences have seen that combination way to much in recent years.But Double Impact was one of the first to do it,and to this day Double Impact is one of the best downright action films.Van Dammes acting is good and his cheorographed fight scenes are clever and original.This film deserves it's props and I'm here to give Van Damme his due,way to go!"
5,A great film,"This film has alot of action. One will see in this motion picture that Van Damme was young, and very charismatic. He still is. The movie has alot of action. Van damme by accident finds his twin brother, and together they go against the bad guys. I believe it is an Asian Gang of mobsters, but anyway it is good. Their is a very beautiful blonde who comes out in the movie. She is very beautiful and has a hot body, a very hot body. You will see Van damme have a nice love scene with her. This movie is well worth it. The action is great-great fight scenes, van damme's acting is great, and the beautiful blonde is a gorgeous woman that is a stunner."
4,Why isn't this on DVD yet?,"Hey, ""Double Impact"" is campy good fun. One of JCVD's best, and Cory Everson is kickin' in it. The theme song jams; it could have been an American hit if released as a single! Nice Hong Kong locations, and JCVD really tries to make his twin brother characters distinct. Give this guy a break."
4,Jean Claude! Jean Claude! Jean Claude!,"I liked this movie. I think my favorite Van Damme movies are this one, Sudden Death and Time Cop. It would be really cool if they could have included the commercial for this movie. I don't know if you remember it but it went something like this: Van Damme in a double role... It's twice the punches, twice the kicks, it's too Damme much! Jean Claude also has my respect in that he voiced his irritation in the Hollywood crowd who stood in protest. Jean Claude gets five stars and my respect. You're the man Jean!"
4,Double Impact,"This is JCVD best! I have watched it over 12 times! I never get tired of watching it it's so good! I liked Raimon Zhang, my favorite villian, Alec is my favorite! WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!"
5,"twice the van damme, twice the action","this movie is so cool, because jean-claude van damme is one of my favorite actors, and to of them makes it even better."
2,"Love the movie, but not on Blu-ray.","This review is not about the movie. The movie is Van Damme at his best and worst. Personally, one of my favorites. I ordered 3 Van Damme movies on blu-ray. Kick boxer, Cyborg and Double Impact. The other 2 looked like bllu-ray movies, but Double Impact on blu-ray proved to be a disappointment. The picture quality looked faded and colors dull. It made me cringe to watch the night scenes. If this movie was called ""The Fog"", I would be okay with it, but it's not. Maybe it's the production quality of the film itself. If you have the dvd, like I do, don't buy the blu-ray........ like I did."
3,Double Impact dvd artwork?,I don't understand why MGM could not use the original theatrical poster with both Van Damme brothers side to side as the movie artwork?
4,This one awesome astion movie,"I just bought this movie and it is one of te best action movies I have seen in a long time. If you are looking for a good action movie to watch, purchase this movie, its awesome, Peace out."
4,"Two Van Dammes, One Hell Of A Movie!","Where else but here (and maybe MAXIMUM RISK and REPLICANT) can you get two Van Dammes for the price of one? Jean-Claude plays both flamboyant homoerotic dance instructor Chad (a/k/a Mr. Black Silk Underwear) and his crooked drug dealer brother, Alex, in this tale of two brothers seperated at birth who reunite in Hong Kong to take on the same crime syndicate that murdered their parents, some twenty years ago.This film is strictly for the action buffs and Van Damme fans. There's some great B-movie lines here and Bolo Yeung finally gets his rematch from BLOODSPORT. Surprisingly, neither of Van Damme's roles was nominated for an Oscar."
4,Are you a JCVD fan?,If you like JCVD then get this movie! I can't get enough of JCVD i don't know why but i just like his movies. The movie has a pretty descent story line and the fighting scenes are good as well. The reason it does not get a 5 star rating is because they didn't do too good of a job transitioning the movie to blu-ray but it is definitely better than dvd.
3,not the best,Usually Jean-Claude's films are excellent (except for Street Fighter)but there was something missing from this film.Its not that bad but not the best.I hope he gets back on his feet.
4,DOUBLE THE FUN!,"In this madcap caper comedy, Elvis Presley plays a singing, swinging, lothario being chased across Europe by adoring mini-skirted lovelies and some VERY inept jewel thieves. Complicating matters even further is a nasty subplot involving an unscrupulous uncle's attempt to ""off"" his own neice and claim her inheritance for himself! But as always, the big attraction here are the songs, which include ""I Love Only One Girl,"" the obligatory catchy title tune, and, best of all, Presley's masterful reading of ""Old Macdonald."" Put this on your shelf next to the best of Chaplin, Sellers, and Allen; u won't be disappointed you did."
1,THEY TRY BUT THEY CAN'T,"They try hard, but they can't make Van Damme seems like a good actor. The plot about twin is a clever idea, but it doesn't work at all. Bad..........."
4,the man from left field. reba mcentire,"its been some time since i viewed this opus but it had burt in his prime neither of them wouldwin a OSCAR but would put in a computant performance to make the viewing pleasurableits a family movie so dialogue will be ""clean"" so a movie for your collection enjoy the cuz"
3,Like others have said...,"The silver looks like costume jewelry. My wife says she loves it, that might just be because I finally broke down and bought her jewelry."
2,Don't forget what we know now,It should be pointed out that since the 1980s new information about Reed has come to light through access to Soviet archives. These sources reveal that Reed was another in a long line of influential Americans who were paid agents of one of the deadliest totalitarian forces in human history. This doesn't tend to get mentioned when the NY Times and academic establishments praise this book's greatness.
5,Great Primary source,John reed was there. He witnessed the Russian revolution firdt hand . A great book for a student of history esp. of Russian History. Reed brings to life the emotional and sweeping moment in History that was to shape the 20th century
4,""". . .The Internationale Unites The Human Race . . .""","This is Jack Reed's well-written but highly partisan and pro-Bolshevik eyewitness account of the Russian Revolution. Reed's Soviet Socialist biases drip from every page like an oily coating, and this may irritate readers who are not quite so utopian as was Reed. TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD is all but useless as an objective history of the event, but it is extraordinarily useful as a subjective interpretation of the birth of the first Communist state, and therefore, it is an interesting, fascinating, and valuable document well worth reading."
1,One of the most confusing tranquilizers I ever took.,"I began this book in quest of an accurate historical account. Perhaps I was looking for something this author never intended to provide. I found it to be thoroughly confusing and tedious. Just about the time I thought I was beginning to understand what I had read, I found out that I was farther off base than ever! I've read reviews that indicate failure to complete is not unique to me. I made it to 40%. Perhaps upon completing other works I will return and see if this one makes more sense."
2,Ten Days That Shook the World,I read a lot of history books and I just found this very boring. I gave up after reading 50%.
1,Do not order from this company !,"I ordered the wireless headset and this item was suggested as an accessory ""based on my order. There is only a picture, no description of the item. I figured since it was suggested to me ""based on my selection"" that it would fit the headset I ordered....NOT ! This is a windscreen for a regular sized microphone ! The shipping cost more than the actual item,...and would have cost me more in shipping fees to send back plus there was no return information or instructions enclosed with my order. What a hassle and a waste of money !"
5,A Must Read,"You Can't Push a Rope depicts a multicolored, multiethnic community with freshness and insight. Savvy and engaging, Clint Trafton, winner of the Frank Waters Southwestern Writing Award, portrays Chava Traxler, a Hispanic/Anglo teen as a youngster caught up in a family feud over repossession of a Spanish Land Grant property stolen by speculators in a small New Mexico town. I would highly recommend this and other works by Clint Trafton."
5,One of Many,"I am just one of many who love this book but I think I owe it to share my say. A writing coach recommended it to me. I've been reading it for months and can't stop thinking or talking about it. Everyone should read it. Most of the reviewers have given a good idea of what's inside the book. My review is just additional motivation for anyone who is undecided. If you don't love this book, you don't like reading I think!"
4,Great reading!,A book that covers the nooks and crannies of lower Manhattan. Oddball characters are brought to fullbloom under the author's pen. He knew how to listen! Towards the back some great essays ongrowing up along the Carolina coast.
5,Fun to read.,Mostly biographical vignettes of a motley assortment of eccentrics and crazy characters. Author has remarkable powers of observation and description. Darkly humorous and addictive fun reading!
5,A collection worthy of reading over and over,"Joe Mitchell was a New Yorker Magazine original, and in this collection representing three decades of authorship, you will find him at his very best. You wil also rediscover how very good journalism can be when someone works at it with genuine care for his craft and sincere love for his subject. One of those rare books that always seems to be cross-referenced in every bookstore under history, journalism, fiction, literature. And when you arrive at any of these sections, you;ll never find enough copies of Mitchell. C.E. Lincoln lincoln.page@MCI2000.com"
2,Giant Disappointment,"Hilary Mantel has a unique ability to tell a story through the conversations of her characters. The book is carried along by each character's thoughts and words. This story told in the Irish dialect of its subjects, is at times amusing and often poignant, but ultimately depressing. Frankly there were no surprises in this story. It ground along with the giant and his retinue heading for their predictable end.After reading Mantel's last book, Bring Up the Bodies, I was really disappointed in this one. She has certainly honed her craft since this early work."
2,underwhelmed,the reader from Hoboken reflects my sentiments about this novel: I was disappointed and had difficulty following Mantel's train of thought esp. with shifts from third to first person and back again. The use of the vernacular in conversations was not effective -- it was distracting and hard to follow.
2,Disappointed,I can't begin to describe my disappointment in this book. Perhaps it was simply Hilary Mantel's writing style but I found it annoying to try to follow her train of thought. Often I wasn't sure of the narration perspective; was it O'Brien's narration at times and then at others the author's? I'm frankly amazed at the books apparent popularity.
3,Subject of Interest; Execution Less So,"This book deals with an interesting subject--how ""freaks of nature"" were viewed in the 18th century--but the characterizations are not the strongest. And it's on the grim side, too. Now this writer specializes in the more violent aspects of historical events, but this book doesn't have the vividness of either Place of Greater Safety or her latest, Wolf Hall, which is hard to put down. But it is worth it for the 18th century detail and mindset."
4,giant fun,loved it..great off beat story..freak with a heart. the historical touches are great..the giant is one well developed character..somewhat mystical as well..enjoy..
2,A mistake for those interested in the history of medicine.,"I began the book knowing that it was primarily fiction not fact. However was very disappointed in the overwhelming ""fantasy"" nature of the novel. Somewhat shocked as well at the portaitures - necrophiliac misanthropes - of the Hunter brothers. Students of history look elsewhere."
1,A Messy Misfire,"I wouldn't mind the fragmentary style (which even the book's defenders admit to), if the book had heart. But it doesn't. What it does have is a certain messiness and nastiness. And at the end, you think, ""Well, what's the point?"" The last line is good. Too bad the rest of the boook isn't."
2,Only works with Topeak rack,"I ordered this with the assumption that it will include a way to attach it onto my bike. I was mistaken. This fender only attaches to a certain bike rack. The description failed to mention this. Not happy with that, but I managed to McGyver it onto my bike. If you can get the thing onto your bike, it works great."
5,I could not put this book down,"After reading some other reviews, I felt I had to speak up. I could not put this book down; I read it in 5 days. I found I really cared about the main characters. This book, like many of King's, made me think. The general outcome at the end was predictable, but so what. King did what he does best, he told a great story. As for the gross stuff and the profanity, I think that is typical for King, and how I would expect these characters and creatures would act. IMO it is worth the read."
3,"Not as good as ""The Shining""","The first King novel that I read was ""The Shining"" and from that point i decided that I would become an avid reader of Stephen King. So when ""Dreamcatcher"" was released I did not hestitate in purchasing it.Overall, I felt this book was entertaining. Many times during the course of the reading, I found myself wanting to skip ahead a few pages to find out what happens next. King seems to overindulge the reader with long descriptions that cause the reader to lose sight of the novels story.Also, the action and the movement of the plot is inconsistent throughoput the book. We are introduced to the four friends and then introduced to the ""alien-like"" creature. At this point it seems as if the book was about to get increasingly interesting. However, I realized there was about 300 more pages of material to read.I would recommend this book if there is nothing else that you really want to read sitting on the end table."
3,Not his best work,"Maybe I've read too many Stephen King novels over the years but the end of this book was just too predictable. I won't spoil it for the rest of you by giving it away but you'll probably figure it out about halfway. That wouldn't have bothered me so much if the narrative in between the beginning in the end had been better. There were some good parts but the book just didn't seem to flow like his other ones. If you've never read Stephen King before (and if not, what planet are you from?) do not start with this one"
1,Disappointed overall...spoiled by his great ones,"The gore, the language and the extremely confusing story made this a true disappointment for me after this exciting wait. I could not wait to get it and then really had to convince myself to even finish. I did read it to the bitter end hoping for a string to be pulled to make it all worthwhile. Alas! No string. Just a disturbing story that did not make it worthy to recommend in my opinion."
4,DreamCatcher!,"Jonesy, Beaver, Henry, and Pete are four young friends who save a boy named Duddits,who had a syndrome. They helped Duddits from other boys in another words they were his protectors. From that day they found a special bond between them who immunes them with each other.Every year they go up to Maine for their annual hunting trip.While they were their they saw strange things happening, and witness, for the first time, creatures beyond their imagination. Soon they found out that they are taking part in alien invasion. Two friend died during the book Pete and Beaver. The other two friends Jonesy and Henry save the Earth from contaminated water supply with a disease called Byrus. In ending they found out that they saved the world by aliens from their friend ""DreamCatcher,"" Duddits."
4,Dreamcatcher,"I was reccomended by a friend to read ""Dreamcatcher"". I had always known about Stephen King but never read one of his books. I can gladly say I was not disappointed. I can say I loved, I can say I liked it, then why do I give it four stars? It is confusing and childish at the times when the men were boys. Otherwise it was a beautifully crafted book filled with heart and horror. An interesting technique in this book is that it is written in third person but switches points of view from section to section, giving scenes depth that is not found in other books. I liked it but i would not reccomend it for a first time King reader. Try ""The Shining"", it is King at his finest with classic horror and genuine spookiness."
2,Why all the silly flatulence stuff? I don't get it.,"THis had everything to be a great book about the good old alien theme. But King blew it.The friendship between the five characters is very touching, I really enjoyed it. But the book keep coming back and forth, the Kurtz character is so cliched, the flatulence stuff is atrocious, the ending is disappointing. And there's noc lear explanation to what will happen. And it takes so LONG to finally understand (more or less) how the aliens operate, how the fungus work and why there's that canibal worm.But King is such a master writer that even so I found myself reading it fast and anxious to reach the end."
3,Disappointed and confused,"First, I must admit that I am a Stephen King fanatic, I have purchased (to the detriment of my checking account) and read every one of his books. The vast majority have provided me with hours of entertainment and sheer pleasure, with a few notable exceptions, ie; Tom Gordon, Gerald's Game. Unfortunately I have now added 'Dreamcatcher' to the DUD list. I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of the book but became bored and then completely confused. Will someone please explain the ending to me? One minute Mr. Gray is controlling Jonsey's body and the next we are being told that he never existed? That it had something to do with Jonsey's accident and comatose state while in the hospital?? TOTALLY CONFUSED!I will continue to eagerly await any new novel by Stephen King and I will forever be a huge fan but I can't, in good conscience, recommend Dreamcatcher.I yearn for more books like 'The Talisman' which is and always has been my favourite."
2,Maybe Stephen King Lost His Mind When He Was Hit By The Car.,"I could not take this book after 100 pages, this is not Stephen King as I know him. This may be his Worst Book every written, The language was really going over the edge, Not even Clancy went this far. If you want to read real Stephen King read Bag Of Bones & Hearts In Atlantis, They may not be Horror but they're good books and they're better than this stink bomb. Grade: D-"
5,AWSOME,I HAVE ALWAYS DISLIKED STEPHEN KING'S MOVIES BECAUSE THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE JUST TOO GRUESOME. THIS IS THE FIRST NOVEL I HAVE LISTENED TO OR READ AND I AM SORRY I HAVEN'T DELVED INTO HIS WORKS BEFORE THIS. THE ACTOR READING THIS BOOK DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB AND CAN SLIP IN AND OUT OF THE BOSTON ACCENT WITHOUT A HITCH. EAT YOUR HEART OUT KEVIN COSTNER! I CAN'T WAIT TO GET BACK IN MY CAR TO FINISH LISTENING TO THIS BOOK. I SOMETIMES FIND MYSELF PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY WITH THE CAR RUNNING JUST TO CONTINUE LISTENING TO THIS NOVEL. IT IS EVOKES SO MANY EMOTIONS AND SOME OF THE PARTS ARE SO FUNNY!!! I WOULD NEVER BELEIVE THAT STEPHEN KING HAD A SENSE OF HUMOR FROM HIS MOVIES. HOLLYWOOD MUST HAVE ELIMINATED MOST OF THE HUMOUR AND WENT STRATIGHT FOR THE MACABRE.
3,Insertion of personal political opinions diminishes the book,"This is much improved over the last several novels by Mr. King; It is exciting without being grotesque, entertaining without the inclusion of injuries and crimes against children, and certainly worth the time spent reading it and the money spent buying it; HOWEVER, Mr. King inserts a few of his own opinions regarding our last presidential election and these opinions detract from and diminish the book. Perhaps he is forgetting that half the voters in this country voted for each candidate, or perhaps he doesn't mind alienating half his readers. The fact is, Mr. King is an author, not a national leader or opinion maker or policy setter and if the public wants to know his political views, we'll ask. As for me, I've bought my last King novel."
2,Waste of time,"Don't read this book even if the first 200 pages catches your attention. The rest of the book is drawn out, lacking energy and originality. The theme of ""alien among us"" is done to the death and this book offers nothing that can't be seen in other similar stories. Total waste of time."
2,typical King,"I was a big fan of king up till the shining and since then he's just another get paid by the word hack.I got the loan of this book from a friend and spotted every single old idea of his that he's recycled hundreds of times over....The man just isn't scary and he's oh sooooo predictable. ""HP Lovecraft"". your mantle of the best horror writer this century remains unclaimed."
1,"SK's worst ever, really 0 stars","I hated it. Bad plot, poorly delivered, terrible book. SK has written some really good books, but this one was so bad I have not read another SK since. I do not believe would even be published if unknown author. Don't waste your time!"
1,King's worst one yet!,"Being a big fan of Stephen King, and having read nearly everything he's ever published, I picked up Dreamcatcher on the day it hit the bookstores. At almost 600 pages it looked to be good value for my money, but I'm warning every King fan who's contemplating buying this book: it's the worst one he's ever written. Take a heavy dose of Tommyknockers, add in a little It mixed with second-rate science fiction (that's trying to be a mix between Alien and Close Encounters of the Third Kind but fails miserably) and you have a very tired-feeling Stephen King novel. If you've read any of the above-mentioned books (or seen any of the films), don't buy this book. And if you haven't, don't do it anyway. Read The girl who loved Tom Gordon or Pet Sematary instead."
4,Who moved my cheese?,"No, but seriously, Stephen is the King of cheese-moving. He moves more cheese than a rat in a Winnebago, know what I'm saying?"
2,Is Stephen King loosing it?,"I understand the author was not going through his best time when he wrote this book but I was very disapointed: the characters are not specially well developed (I hardly got to know any of them at all by the novel) and the aliens did not seem at all interesting, or scary, or fun even. Hope Black House brings back Mr. King as I formerly knew him."
2,Tried to like it...,"As a huge fan of early Stephen King works, I had heard that this was so much like ""IT"" and ""The Stand"" and so I was excited about reading it. In my opinion it was totally vulgar and I don't think that all that vulgarity was necessary to create the story. I found the book to be confusing as well, towards the end. There were times when I had to stop reading it as I felt sick to my stomach....maybe that's a good thing??!! King is still in my opinion an extremly great writer but I thinkat times he tries too hard to be gross. All in all, I was disappointed...hopefully the next one will be better..."
1,Boring As Hell,"I wish the man would just tell the damn story. I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book--bought it the first day it was available, made no week-end plans, announced that carry-out food only would be served for the following days while I plunged into the pleasure of a Stephen King. About halfway through the book I gave up--a major yawn and somewhat irritating to try to read. I imagine Hell to be a road trip with this book being on the tape deck."
1,A $... Disappointment,"As a fan of Stephen King for over 20 years, I bought this bookwith high expectations but have been heartily disappointed by it. Across between ""The Tommyknockers"" and ""Invasion of theBodysnatchers,"" ""Dreamcatcher"" chronicles the tiredworld of ET's attempting to take over the world. Two-dimensionalcharacters do not help the story. I knew and cared about every singlecharacter in ""The Stand"" but I kept getting the relativelyfew characters in ""Dreamcatcher"" mixed up. Stephen King'sfascination with secret government operations is also gettingold.This book reads like a first draft and lacks the carefulcharacterizations and brilliant plots of books like ""TheTalisman,"" ""The Shining"", and so many of King's earlyworks. I do not recommend this book."
2,Extreme Patience Needed...,"I love Steven King! This novel, however, was a disappointment. I could not wait for it to arrive and begin reading it. It started off great and then for about two hundred or more pages it really dragged on and on. I was determined to finish the book to the end but it took me a very long time to get to that point. I found it confusing and boring for two thirds of it; gripping and exciting for one third of it. The plot had so much more potential but something was definitely missing. I was delighted to see that Mr. King chose a young man with special needs to be the hero, that in itself was a great thing. Thank you for that Mr. King."
5,Welcome Back Mr. King!!,"Stephen King is back and better than ever with Dreamcatcher. Not only does he re-enter the world of horror like only he can do, he's also woven several mysteries into this incredible new novel. And, there's NOTHING like Mr. King's humor - subtle, but always, always there. I shuddered at the description of Jonsey's accident - obviously a throw back to the author's near brush with death, and all the little clues only avid King fans will recongise are strewn through. I can't begin to say how happy I am that he's back!"
3,Good read,"I am a long time Stephen King reader but confess that I stopped reading for a while due to what I termed 'formulamatic' endings. I recently picked up 1963 which I found to be one of Stephen's best in a long time. So, I decided I would pick another of his books again. Dreamcatcher starts well (as do many of Stephen's books) and is quite interesting and gripping. However, the 'ending(s)' honestly left me a little unsatisfied with its 'explanation' of the 'aliens' and that whole hospital/mind scene(s)."
2,What Happened?,I think I have read just about every book by Stephen King and I will admit that sometimes his endings are lacking. But this book was ridiculous. I had no idea what the book was about. I mean I had an idea but it had one of the worst story line Ive ever seen. I just didnt see the point of the book. He should have cut it down and made a really short story of it.
4,Stephen King makes a comback...,"After Hearts in Atlantis and The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, I was a little reluctant to plunk down another 28 bucks for a King book. I was pleasantly suprised by this book though. It was like the old Stephen King that I know and love! This book is a good one! Interesting, good story line, just enough thrills and gore to keep you reading and scarey enough to keep you from hanging your feet over the edge of the bed.I was afraid that he had lost his ""umph"" after the last 2 fiascos but take heart King fans! He's baaaaack!!!"
3,"An Average, Unsatisfying King Effort","Just an average read. Not worse than some of his others, but certainly not among my favorites from him. The first book he completed after his life-threatening / -altering accident, this tale combines the worst parts of ""The Tommyknockers"" with some of the comfy, reliable parts of ""The Body"" and ""The Dead Zone."" About 4 childhood friends, one who suffers a car accident very similar to King's own, and a camping trip that turns into disaster, culminating in aliens, a retarded boy with ""a gift"" and other ridiculous, who-cares? climactic elements. Too long a book for the little bit that's actually interesting. A good editor could have probably shaped this into a shorter, tighter, more enjoyable read. Oh, well."
2,But the aliens are cool,"I'm judging this book having read it once, waited a year, and then read it again, and this book did not survive the journey well.Every plot twist was predicted, every villain was a stereotype, everything, everything in this book could be seen in advance or simply mirrored some other book or story, and served only as a pale imitation of the sources it copied. The only good thing in this book were the aliens. Sorry, better luck next time."
3,Not one of his best,"I am a big Stephen King fan. I love his ability to describe in such detail that you can picture every scene. This book was no different. I appreciate how he weaves his other books and ideas in some books. This one directly mentioned events from IT. He even mentioned Pennywise the clown. It was long and it really didn't add to the plot. I couldn't stop once I started, but I've enjoyed many of his other works much better. While it wasn't my favorite, it wasn't my LEAST favorite. If you are a Stephen King fan, you'll enjoy it."
2,An exceptional book from the king: can't finish it,"Being a very loyal Stephen King reader, as I started reading the book, I was very astonished that King published this book (you have the freedom to write, but this doesn't mean that you should publish it, right?) The story starts well, you think something good will come out of it, but even after a hundred pages -a lot of things happen but- nothing happens actually. After around 250 pages I could not go on reading any more, I pushed myself several times to move on, but it simply did not work at all, and then I realized that I actually don't care what is going to happen next, or what is going to happen in the end, and I don't care if they all die or survive, because I didn't have any feelings towards any one of the characters.Stephen King is the king of making people believe the unbelievable. But in this work he fails in putting `unbelievable' things together to make a good story out of it."
2,"Get to the point, King!!!","I was very excited to read the new King book, especially since this was supposed to be his big comeback to horror. However, with the exception of ONE scene in the book, NOTHING at all was terrifying. Not scary, not even a little creepy. King had 879 pages to work with and did nothing with them. Sure, the writing itself is good -- no one denies that. But he needed to get to the point a lot sooner. Master horror authors such as Bentley Little and Richard Laymon could have wrote this book much more effectively in less than half the space! He rambles on and on and on. Maybe the reason this book is so mediocre is that King's real-life car accident did permanent damage to his brain."
4,Dreamcatcher,"King's two primary strengths, those things that he does better than anyone, are showcased in this novel.His characterizations are exquisite. As usual, he bombards the reader with the characters when first introduced, staturating the pages with the flavor of the character while leaving plenty to plumb later as the story develops.In addition, King's voice rings through as clear as ever, like an old friend. I hated for the book to end because I wanted that voice to continue telling me about Duddits and the rest.Unfortunately, King's biggest weakness, in my opinion, is also a big part of this novel, namely his inability to bring his opus to a satisfactory conclusion. Of course, his endings never live up to the promise of the rest of the work but all in all, that's okay. Us King fans are used to it and the novel's charms make up for in spades."
4,Trippy Alien Adventure,"This was a fun book. I will never look at Bacon the same way again. I listened to it on Audio, and toward the end I would drive my car around the block a few extra times just to hear some more of it. It really is a comfortable book, and unlike some of King's stuff, it has a triumphant ending. Jason F. Smith"
3,Not his best....,"4 boyhood friends meet each year to go hunting at Beav's cabin, Hole in the Wall. Each is having difficulties in their lives and look forward to the hunting trip. But this year, a man stumbles into their lives and the cabin, missing teeth and time and carrying a frightening parasite that not even he knows about.This is not King at his best, but as he wrote this book while recovering from his near-fatal car accident, it is wonderful that he has written again, period. The book is frightening and, at time, gross. There are flashes of King brilliance in this book, but a lot of the 700+ pages are taken up with sub-plots and routine stuff that could have been left out of the book. I rejoice that Mr. King is still around and still writing - and recommend this book only half-heartedly."
2,Not one of Stephen King's best efforts...,"I bought this book hoping that it would be similar to ""It"" or ""The Tommyknockers."" Unfortunately, it was very disappointing. The story started out well enough, and the flashbacks to youth were very Stephen King-esqe. Even the 4 adults were somewhat likeable, even with their flaws. The middle of the book was muddled, confused, and meandering. I can't explain why, or I'll be giving away too much. With the weak middle, weak overall plot, and basic confusing premise, the climax of the book ended up being unsatisfing as well...Skip this one unless you are a die hard Stephen King fan. This book will not make you a fan!!"
1,RICHARD BACHMAN RETURNS??????,"Anyone you talk to will tell you that I am probably the biggest Stephen King fan they know; I love his writings!! HOWEVER, I was greatly disappointed in Dreamcatcher. I found it to be very dark and downright WEIRD (not to mention that the language was atrocious even for Stephen King!) much more reminiscent of Richard Bachman than the Stephen King we've come to know and love of recent years. It's my humble opinion that this book was SK's way of lashing out at all the pain he's suffered both mentally and physically since his accident. Want a good King novel??? Pass on Dreamcatcher and pick up THE TALISMAN --now THAT'S a story!!"
2,Not a Sci-Fi Book,"I saw the preview for the movie last month and had to read the book ASAP. What a dissapointment. I was hoping for a good sci-fi book that at least explained something about the aliens. King cops out in the worst way in trying to explain where these creatures come from and why they come to earth. There are logical flaws so huge that really take away from the otherwise fine writing. You are left with an empty feeling at the end. Those who want to read the book for King's writing, go ahead, but those who like sci-fi, avoid like the plague."
3,What a let down,"I say the preview for the movie last month and had to read the book. What a dissapointment. I was hoping for a good sci-fi book that at least explained something about the aliens in the book. King tunes out in the worst way in trying to explain where these creatures come from and why they come to earth. There are logical flaws so huge that really take away from the otherwise fine writing. You are left with an empty feeling at the end. Those who want to read the book for King's writing, go ahead, but those who like sci-fi, avoid like the plague."
2,Too weird,I'm a big King fan and I think the man is a great storyteller BUT. I could not finish this book. The farts and body function descriptions went on and on and on in the beginning then I became so disinterested after the bathroom scene (which was great classic King) that I became confused about what was going on because my mind started to wonder and everything ran together and I didn't know where the characters were or who they were or what they were talking about..... It just could not hold my attention. I may try to read it some other time because I did pay for a hard copy.
3,Disappointing,"Not Mr. King's best work. The book appears to be written for the the mass market, maybe even with a TV movie or big-screen movie in mind. Compared to ""The Green Mile,"" this novel might have been written by another author."
1,Nasty,"Take some good advice! Find three of your best buddies, rent a mountain cabin and replace Dreamcatcher's tainted mind infusion with wonderful memories deserving of the setting. Who wants to spend a thousand pages of time reading about extreme body gas and the ""f"" word (purposely not capitalized) repeated over and over again in every imaginable contortion, etc? (I will always wonder how this kind of ""carrying on"" gets published in the first place, regardless of who wrote it.)"
2,Try reading this book twice...,"I have read and (for the most part) enjoyed S. King books for 25 years. But Dreamcatcher was way too easy to put down. I never got into any of the characters, which turned out not to matter since most of them were killed off early in the novel anyway. I picked it up again last week and read it one more time with a bit more comprehension. But still, the aliens were straight out of Roswell...incredibly cliched.Remember the good ol' days of ""Cujo"" and the like? Even though those characters were flawed, they were real people! The characters in Dreamcatcher are extremely two-dimensional by comparison."
3,Running Dry,"I am a big Stephen King fan, and I have read most of his work, including non fiction. Unfortunately, I cannot shake the feeling that he seems to be running out of things to say. His latest fiction is simply no match for his previous work. I want the old SK back!"
1,drek!,"What a disappointment! The first section was true King, but later King's muse dies. I truly wish he could have maintained the momentum as I felt deflated when I realized this book was going nowhere interesting. Discovered I didn't care what happened to any of the characters, so sadly I closed the book about half-way through and returned it to the library for some other unsuspecting King fan."
4,Wonderful read,"This was a great read. Its remeniscent or even connected to some of his other works, like The Stand, IT, and the Tommyknockers, but is unique from the three. The plot was rich and the characters interesting; the only drawback I found was the ending which seemed a little too neat and clean. I think King ended it leaving too many questions, although maybe he has sequal in mind? I was curious about how public the whole alien thing ended up, what the government was planning to do after, and the maybe psychic connection with Jonesy's child left me wondering.I really liked the battle between Mr. Gray/the byrus and Jonsey in Jonseys mind. Wonderful overall and I would highly recommend reading this interesting book.I am also intersted if King has an IT sequal in mind; to those who have read the book you know what I mean (what was scralled on the standpipe plaque made me wonder!)"
2,Quota Book,"I can read King's work all day long, he is a quick and enjoyable read, but this book had me thinking that it was written to fill a publisher's quota for 2001. The character's childhood friendships could have been developed more and I found the characters had no depth at all. I had to finish the book, but I felt like King forgot he already wrote ""IT"" and was trying to capture the same glory."
5,Stephen continues to entertain,"King's characters stick with you. His attention to detail and the real life human traits he gives his 'fictional' characters make it hard to believe they're not walking off the page. It's more than the horror and suspense, there's a special quality that he gives to a novel that forces it to linger.I'll admit that I never start a Stephen King novel unless I have hours of free time to read it, or can pull a late nighter, because I'm not going to put it down for long. Whenever he features a book dealing with aliens and the state of Maine, I have to chuckle. How many of you readers, besides myself, have friends living in Maine who swear Alien visitations are real?Chrissy K. McVayAuthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'"
2,Not Stephen King's Best,"Two years ago I saw this book at a bookstore with ""The International Bestseller"" printed on its cover. I bought the book, hoping it'd draw me into another world like many other Stephen King books have. But after 5 pages, I put it down because it was boring.Last week, I took the book from the bookshelf and forced myself to read it. There are a few fascinating bits within, like how Jonesy, Pete, Beaver and Henry met Duddits, but the book has generally been tedious to read (and I'm only halfway through).The massive amount of jumping back and forth through time is confusing. Some parts of the book just seem like rambling and fluff.I'm a Stephen King fan, but this book is a little disappointing. I'd recommend The Shining, The Bachman Books and IT to first time King readers."
4,Imaginative,"This book was probably the most creative King has ever written, with the most pyscological metaphors and interesting ideas. I would reccommend this book for its imagination, if nothing else.Good: The charachters are sufficeintly likable, and it is not really predictable, the writing is good, the ideas are great, finally the story is engaging and originalBad : Some of the scenes are unnessescary gross and graphic, not really that scary if thats what you are looking for, really long when it didnt have to beGood or Bad ? : Is it just me or does stephen king have an obsession with flatulence........ In Hearts of Atlantis, he devoted a chapter to farting, and in this book, half of it is people passing gas .....................Overall, this book is creative and compelling, but it has its flaws"
2,It just didn't do it for me,"Hearing about the book Dreamcatcher from my friends, I assumed it was a great read and I look forward to reading it before ever opening it. After the first six chapters, the book was really boring me. If it weren't for the fact I had to write a book report on Dreamcatcher for my class, I would have quit reading it right away. A couple of parts were interesting, but the alien conflict was little to none. I guess you could say Stephen King caught the wrong dream to write about this time."
3,Wait for the paperback version,"What a disappointment. I read Bag of Bones, Hearts in Atlantis, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon and the ebook The Plant. When I heard the title I got excited; I love the concept of dreamcatcher. After feeling the improvement in his writing style I just couldn't wait to read Dreamcatcher. It had everything you could ask for in a nightmare: Aliens, Boggymen, Crazy Army Brass, Plague, Chases. Once I started I realized it had a problem, the writing was lengthy. King was drumming his narative painfully slow. It was driving me up the walls. All I can say: ""Stephen get rid of the fountain pen."""
4,That's what you get for hunting...,"Under the most liberal of interpretations, I would not qualify as a devotee of Stephen King. From time to time he has served as a nice change of pace for me. I found DREAMCATCHER to be a pretty good story and a fun book to read.It appeared to me King borrowed from a number of others, often paying tribute along the way, but the application of his personal spin deflected any concerns about ""I've heard this one before."" Two things I personally found creative were the warehousing aspect of our memory storage and the character of 'Duddits Cavell', a sort of Down's syndrome-afflicted Navajo translator of the mind-meld set.I really cannot tell you if King is back, I never knew he left. All I can say is this is a book that will not disappoint anyone looking for a good old fashioned ""us vs. them"" scary story."
3,What's with the featured reviewers?!,"I can't imagine who or why anyone would pick up a Stephen King novel and not expect quite a bit of gore. Also the man's tendency to include a lot of ""bathroom"" elements in his fiction is a recurring theme in his writing that has hardly been without precedent in his work, especially recently, and intestinal discomfort really does seem to be the kernel of this book. So it seems unfair to me to whine about it.I didn't feel that this is a novel that could be ranked with his best, but I do think it was a diverting story and certainly worth reading."
2,Not his best,"4 boyhood friends meet each year to go hunting at Beav's cabin, Hole in the Wall. Each is having difficulties in their lives and look forward to the hunting trip. But this year, a man stumbles into their lives and the cabin, missing teeth and time and carrying a frightening parasite that not even he knows about.This is not King at his best, but as he wrote this book while recovering from his near-fatal car accident, it is wonderful that he has written again, period. The book is frightening and, at time, gross. There are flashes of King brilliance in this book, but a lot of the 700+ pages are taken up with sub-plots and routine stuff that could have been left out of the book. I rejoice that Mr. King is still around and still writing - and recommend this book only half-heartedly."
3,Come on Steve...,"I loved ""On Writing"", I loved ""The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon"" (well, the ending was a little disappointing) and most everything he wrote in the eighties. There are only about 3 of his book I have not read. But this...First of all, I enjoy getting pulled into Dreamcatcher. Like most of his works, the first few scenes combined with his wonderfully earthy characters are vintage King magic.But after a couple of hundred pages I found myself getting a little bored. The plot became predictable and the action became stilted. I forced myself through the last two hundred or so pages to a so-so ending.But I give it three stars (well 2 1/2 anyway) because I still can't help but enjoy his writing style. Hey, it's Stephen King man! But I think he could've edited out about 150 to 250 pages and made this work a little more dynamic."
3,Not King's Best,"For some reason I get to read all King's books at night, and so, it is always a lot scarier. Don't let the title mistake you, this book had kept me on my toes, and gave me goosebumps. However, King can do a lot better. The charecters in this book are really shallow and not really interesting, unlike the deep and complex charecters that King can build with his master hands. The plot is pretty good. The idea of using articles about UFOs in the begining was cool, and fits to the time of the writing of the book, when the UFOmania spread around the world. However, the plot is sometimes silly, and the horror is ""Freddie Kruger"" style. King is focusing in groosom, blood and disgusting things, rather than his usual psychological terror, like the one in ""Pet Sematary"" for example. On the other hand, we must remember that King was passing an uneasy time when he wrote this book, and I guess it has effected him. It is a nice book, but he can do better."
3,Flawed,"The first 200 pages of Stephen King's Dreamcatcher are without a doubt the best part of the book. Action and suspense fill the story, and the characters interest you as we come to learn who they are, and what is bothering them. Then the aliens land, and the stranger, McCarthy stumbles upon Jonesy, and we have the rest of the novel. This consists of 400 pages of waiting, traveling, and flashbacks that are needed for the story, but unliked all the same. The theory of the novel is nothing new, but King again tries his best to tell us a good story. At 620 pages, Dreamcatcher is far too long, and this is coming from someone who's read IT and The Stand and as enjoyed both thoroughly. Not terrible, but not great either."
4,Novel or Hypothesis?,"Dreamcatcher is a book that has finally arrived. Like a breath held too long released in a long awaited exhale. The subject that was eye candy was the exploration of telepathy. Stephen King brushed telepathy in ""Hearts in Atlantis""; really nicked it in ""The Green Mile""; and took telepathy out and played with it in ""Insomnia"". Now, telepathy's potential was examined in this captivating tale that makes you feel that you are everywhere in the story at once. The overuse of the F-key was somewhat distracting but I did find it interesting, the use of writing tenses, past and present. The main story was written in past tense while the back story, in the beginning, was written in present tense which really set it apart. Way to go Stephen."
3,Familiar Plot,"While Stephen King exhibits expert writing tactics, with vivid descriptions and creative plot twists, I cannot help but be reminded of Stand By Me. A good read, not his best work, but his worst either."
1,Waste of time,"What a disappointment. Nothing like my favorite, The Green Mile. Dont waste your time. Boring."
2,I'm ready for another Dark Tower book,"SInce ""IT"" King has been very hit or miss. And this one is a miss. His worst book alongside ""Insomnia"". This one reminds me of ""Bag of Bones"" too. A 300 page story inflated to 600+ pages. There was some great writing but it lost me at about the 200 page mark. The stuff with the weasel-like parasites was great but once Kurtz showed up I became bored."
1,Dreamcatcher by Stephen King,"Having waited quite awhile since King's last release, I was elated when Dreamcatcher hit the bookstores. I read numerous reviews that praise it as a ""masterpiece"" and ""a gripping title."" However compelling, the reviewers neglected to mention the vulgarity, bathroom humor, and cliched subplots that pepper the book's contents. Not only is the dialog extremely redundant, but the books references to the past experiences of the main characters are limited to a few short anecdotes which seem to be repeated every other page. Even the main plot of the book is relatively obscure, and throughout most of the book there is no sense of urgency that King is apparently trying to express. After reading this six hundred page book, I realize it could have been written with a third of those pages. When you do put this exciting thriller down, I hope it's in the trash."
2,"Unfortunately, it's one of King's worst","It's too long, much too long, for the story. The characters are thinly drawn, the portrayal of Duddits is hopelessly sentimental, Kurtz is a stereotype and a cliche, the biology of the aliens makes little sense, nor does the connection between the four friends and Duddits (we never quite know just what Duddits has been doing, if anything) and it all has a hangdog, been-there-done-that feel. ..."
2,the dreamcatcher,i didn't like the story at all iam not a big fan of scary moviesi felt that the book was very confusing it had you going back and forth from the past to present then back to the past again. i give the book one thumb down.
2,What a bore!,I love a good horror book & this was not it. This was a total waste of time. I had to force myself to finish it only so I would know what people are talking about. A book has to be really bad for me not to finish it. I found it really stupid with all the belching & flatulance although I imagine teens will really like that part of it.
2,No!,"Sorry, but this book doesn't live up to the name of the author.In this work, King almost undermines the existence of extraterriatrals by vulgarizing their intelligence into some mass-produced weazel horror movie that has become so cliché.Probably written during one of King's bored periods...Only two stars."
2,"I expected more from King, much more","I am an avid fan. I have read each and every book that King has written. This book was a TOTAL disappointment! I was so excited when I noticed his book in the bookstore. I purchased it immediately. Well, I can't get past the first 100 pages."
5,"Gregory Lions, author of ""A Tangled Web"" says: AWESOME","I was drawn inescapably into the tale that King told. The four life-long friends, Beave, Jonesy, Henry and Peter as well as their adopted pal ""Duddits"". The story is so multi-faceted it was a reader's amusement park.I was especially impressed by Mr. King's exploration of the mind itself and our own perception of who/what we as beings really are.The villains, Mr. Gray and Kurtz were particularly odious.The pacing of the story was high-speed and Stephen masterfully employed his cliff-hanger technique from chapter to chapter building my expectations to a frenzy then always satisfying them.Anyone who dares dismiss Stephen King's ""Dreamcatcher"" as mainstream fare has obviously not read it. This is a book that will gain him legions more fans.(...)"
3,"fast moving and pleasant read, HOWEVER...","I am only 1/4 done with this book right now and enjoying the ride. HOWEVER, I am getting tired of the same old plot tricks. How many times do we have to be relied upon to drop back and forth from childhood to adulthood, Mr. King? And also, Mr. King, you are getting sloppy with your story telling. One single point of contention: how can a bathroom door which two grown men ""rushed forward together...,almost four hundred pounds behind two dropped shoulders. It gave way with absurd ease..."" How can such a ruined door then be used to keep an enemy within? A man can hold a such a door shut by clutching the doorknob tightly? C'mon. Be real. Or be unreal. Just be constant."
3,Pennywise kicks the Grayboys' butt,"I'm a huge Stephen King fan (not in girth), have read all of his and Bachman's books and reread the two previous Derry books just to get myself in the mood for this one. I have to say that I was mostly dissappointed. Most people complain that King's books are too wordy, but the true fans know what its like to be knocked flat by the climax and ending of any of his classics. Dreamcatcher did not knock me flat, and sorta made me wish that RF would show up and put the characters out of their misery. Mostly the story dragged on, and failed to make a connection between the reader and the characters. The ending, too, was a *shudder* weak dialogue. Of course, the style of writing was great and I'll give him credit for a few original and shocking scenes (and the allusion to Will Dearborn hehe), but I mostly got the idea that he was venting the experiences of his accident. Anyways, I'm looking forward to a return of the storytelling that we all know and love."
2,dreamcatcher,"IT WAS SAID IF YOU LIKE BAG OF BONES YOU WOULD LOVE DREAMCATCHER. WELL, I DO NOT AGREE. I READ BAG OF BONES IN A MATTER OF DAYS, IT HAS BEEN A MONTH AND I STILL CANNOT GET INTO DREAMCATCHER. IT IS VERY SLOW AND DOES NOT SEEM TO PICK UP ANYWHERE. NOT AMONG THE BEST KING BOOKS I HAVE READ."
2,Not His Best,"Like many others I am a big fan of Stephen King. Most of his books are terrific but ""Dreamcatcher"" joins his other two bombs, ""The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon"" and ""The Talisman"". The first part of the book is well written but it later deteriorates into gibberish. I had a hard time telling who was in who's mind or who was doing what to which when. As someone once said ""In every fat book there's a thin book trying to get out"". King claims to have written this whole book with a fountain pen. I hope he has gotten over his writer's cramp by now so he can start on a better book up to his usual higher standard. Think thin (or is it ""Thinner""."
5,Heeere's Stevie!...,"Yeah, baby, the master is back in top, scary, breathtaking form. Derry, a town I'm glad I don't live in, is also back as the site where all these strange and terrible things occur. Four men who are telepathically linked take part in strange and horrifying doings. Suffice it to say that there are zombies, body snatchers and space aliens and that as crazy as that sounds it all makes sense. The horror meister never lets up for a moment. My pillow was damp with the sweat that can only come from a good Stephen King novel. I loved it!"
2,Dreamcatcher,"I have read a few Steven King novels, but this one just did not do it for me. I normally do not read novels dealing with Science Fiction, but it did sound a little interesting. After reading the first chapter I completely lost interest in it. After reading further, I disliked the book more and more. The book jumped around too much, I could not follow the content at times. In my opinion, King is an excellent writer, but this one was not one of his best."
2,Horror?,"In some funny way, this is absurd humor. Horror it ain't. Grasping at straws, it gets boring, so humorous it also ain't. So what's the point? I guess living up there in Maine, a body's got to do SOMETHING to while away the time."
4,Excellent book.... not for the unintelligent though,"This is a great book. I've read about 10 King books and this rates in the top third for sure. I think one of my favorite things about this book is how unique it is for King.For example, part of the plot occurrs in the ""Dreamworld"" - aliens come from outer space, etc. Loved the X-filesesque vibe too.It's complex though, and as you can see below, the unintelligent have had a rough time with this book. But stick with it. It's really a great one. It has a very riveting and satisfying final 100 pages too.Well worth your time!(p.s. I grade King on a curve - if this wasn't a King book, I'd give it 5 stars)"
3,Good Book,"I reviewed it very recently, on August 8th, but I'm writing another review because of something I don't get. In my first review I mentioned the parasites that dwell in the victims colon and come out their you-know-what. Being the classy guy I am, I didn't refer to them in the way they are mentioned in the book. Instead I carefully put a dash in there. This time I'll put four dashes in there when I mention the ---- weisels. My question is, why, right above me, did the people who approve these reviews allow a reviewer to write the word without any dashes at all, but the last paragraph of my review, where I mentioned the ---- weisels with only one dash got edited out? I don't understand. Disguising the swear word is apparently worse than just typing it out. But why... In conclusion, this is a good book, if somewhat familiar. King fans will enjoy it."
1,A hard Book to Follow,"I am a big Stephen King fan and have all his books. However this one was hard to finish. About half way through I almost gave up. It is hard to follow and sometimes you have no idea what he is talking about. The book started out great but, it's easy to get confused with all the characters and their thoughts. I am very disappointed as I always look forward to his next book. Maybe Mr. King should go more for quality instead of quantity."
2,"At 200 pages ""Dreamcatcher"" would be CLASSIC...","Too bad it's over 600. This book becomes the most monotonous of Stephen King's career. I have read all of his novels, and this is one of his worst. The only thing that saves it from being THEE worst (that honor still belongs to the overrated Christine) is the first 200 pages, which are gory, over-the-top fun. The rest of the book comes off as both trite and pretentious, at the same time. The characters are developed fairly well in the first 200 pages, and then go no where. The character of Kurtz is the ultimate cliche, and having him sucking up a large part of the last 200 pages was a BIG mistake. The extended chase at the end is tedious, not at all frightening, and turns a novel that started out excellent into an absolute disaster."
2,well below par,I was very disappointed in the latest novel from MR. King. I found it way to long and convoluted. I wonder if he is being paid by the word. I also have this same problem with Tom Clancy's more recent works. In Mr. Kings case his best works were his earlier creations. The dreamcatcher for me was just a bad dream.
2,Received the item,I eventuially received the item. This was the longest I have have waited for a product from amazon. I contacted customer service and I did not receive a reply. However I did get the item.
5,The Dreamcatcher,"This is an awesome book! When I first read it, i was a little confused, but when I read it again, it was two times better than it was the first time. Stephen King wrote this book when you was recuperating from a fatal accident. The title of the book was supposed to be called, ""Cancer,"" but his wife said that title could bring bad luck. So, instead, he called it ""Dreamcatcher.""When the four friends, Pete, Beaver, Henry, and Jonesy, all go out on their traditional hunting trip in Maine, they run into some trouble. Little did they know, that their shared past would aide them in their advendures."
3,Good Read !,"I liked this book! I read this months prior to the release of the movie and I'm glad that I did. This one kind of played with my emotions, it began to lose me at times and then slowly pulled me back."
4,A great Stephen King Book,"This is one of his better books. It's not that scary, but has great action. It takes place in the common setting of his book, Maine.The psychological aspect of this book is great. This book also hints at parts of older books, such as ""It."" This book is twice as good as the movie. I'd recommend this book for any Stephen King fan."
1,what was he thinking?,This book had the ability to be something truely amazing. With well rounded charactors and an enticing plot...and S**t weasels?!?! The story took a huge dive and pluged in to the territory of a horrid B-movie plot line. It had the feel of a split personality one side the chance to be a intelegent classic... and the other a freakish dead weight draging the story down in to the neither world of a bad read. I wish I had stopped reading before the downward plunge of plot so that i could still appricate the charators with out shuddering.
2,"This book is confusing, boring and retro.","I bought this book with great enthusiasm. The New York Times book review was great. But,in contrast, I found the novel to be confusing, boring and retro. Retro... It reminded me of the segment King was in in the first Tales from the Crypt movie. Remember King playing a red neck whose farm is hit by a space ship and then he drinks the water and turns into a giant topiary? As some of the other reviewers have stated, I also had to page back to try to find references to what I now was reading. This novel is a regurgatation for King. I await another Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile,The Stand. Mr. King, I love ya. But not this one."
1,My last Steven King novel,"My only hope is that Steven King occasionally reads some of these reviews because if he did, he would notice a growing number of us who have become increasingly unhapphy with his work.My theory is that the author has an adversion to any form of editing. The result a 350 page novel that is bloated to almost 900 pages. Fortunately for the author, there are still a large number of die-hard fans who will always buy and praise anything he writes. I'm convinced that Steve King could publish the white pages of a large city phone book and not only his loyal fans buy it, they would also give it their customary 5 star rating."
4,"Not King's best, but entertaining","For me, this book probably ranks right about in the middle between King's best and worst books. It's entertaining, and you can get into the characters, but I guess the book is more of a ""downer"" than most of his. I won't say and spoil it for anybody.As far as the audiobook goes, the reader takes a little getting used to. He reads in kind of this matter-of-fact ""Mr Rogers Neighborhood"" kind of voice, which at first seems really odd given the subject matter. Eventually you get used to it though, and it's not so bad."
2,The Dreamcatcher,"I have read every book SK has ever written, and I must say, I was very disappointed in this book. The first few chapters, I thought, OK here we go...but about 1/3 of the way through the book, I became disenchanted. This book reminded me of the Tommyknockers, the one book of his that I was not to thrilled with either...I was very interested in the characters at first, but suddenly they are all mostly dead...this book flip flopped back and forth with little explanation. Unlike IT, which also flip flopped back and forth, but that was very easy to read. I felt this novel was NOT easy to read, and found myself skimming over too much, just because I did not care...which is very unlike me when I read a SK novel. Hopefully, the next one will be better !!"
3,Not his best work.,"I am a very big fan of Stephen king's novels and can honestly say that this book just isn't hapenning. The book starts very interesting but as you keep reading it gets more and more boring. If you are thinking of buying this book, you will be better off buying one of his other novels."
2,Not quality King.,"Like a previous reviewer, I nipped and nibbled at this book with only marginal enthusiasm that slowly diminished as I neared the end. The characters were more interesting as they each recalled their childhoods than they were as adults, meaning that the plot in the book's present time was not that exciting. Poor character developement for the antagonists is partially to blame, but I also feel the story could have been told in a series of at least three books that may have fleshed out several of the characters along with the overall story. Try reading some of King's older works instead."
2,The Not So Grand Finale,"Avoid unless desperate for a Kingfix. This novel blows a gasket in the final ""act."" Up until that point, I was hooked, especially after two hundred odd pages of a gripping chase sequence. But the long heralded return of the Duddits character, while moving, is also a major let down. King is one hell of a yarn spinner and sustains interest throughout, but tale's end is an abrupt fizzle, downgrading this into a routine X-FILES pastiche. DREAMCATCHER does not continue King's winning streak begun with BAG OF BONES and then THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON. No worries, he's sure to get back into the groove in the future."
3,Typical New King,"I found this novel to be consistent with most of King's work since 1992. I'm not sure what it is, but he seems to always start out extremely strong with excellent plot and character development only to fizzle out by the end of the book with a sub-par ending. This holds true for such books as Rose Madder, Insomnia, and Desperation. In Dreamcathcer, I was 300 pages in and still hooked, anxiously trying to determine where this story was taking me and the fate of the masterly-developed characters. By the end of the novel, the chase was on and I had lost interest and was desperately trying just to finish the book. Personally, I find King's best work to be those in which he doesn't stray to far from the norm."
1,"Sigh, I really had my hopes up","I love Stephen King. I have read most of his work and I was really looking forward to adding this one to the list. Sadly this book is probably one of the worst ones ive read. I have actually been a fan of King's newer novels, but this is the first one were I am able to see the deterioration of his work. There was not a single point in this novel that I cared about any character. The plot not only has huge wholes but delivers a surprise ending that not only makes no real sense, but is contradicted many times in the novel itself. Dont waste your money on this book in hardcover. If you must read it wait for it to come out in paper back."
4,A Good Book but not the Best,Dreamcatcher was a good book but there were a few things i didnt like aboutit.I didnt like how Stephen King sometimes wrote like he was talking to himself.Sometimes i got so mixed up with it especially when he kept switching between past and present and what was happening at the Hole in the Wall and Duddits....Onthe upside it was a good book with lifelike characters and a really scary plot. It was one of Stephen Kings better books.
4,Dreamcatcher-4 stars,"Dreamcatcher is a very interesting and horrifying book. This is another story by Stephen King where he takes an ordinary event and makes it into a horror story. It is about four friends who are in Maine for their annual hunting trip. Suddenly, a stranger comes into their camp, lost and delirious. Then, the four friends are trapped with a creature from another world, and the only thing that can save them is their friendship. My favorite part was when the four boys save Duddits (a retarded kid) from bullies."
2,A story patched together from previous works,"I've read nearly every King book written, and when I read this one, it was as if he cut and pasted old books together to build this story. There's aliens, like Tommyknockers; there's childhood friends who reunite as adults, like IT, et al; there's a child with disabilities who has an extraordinary mind, like Desperation; even the ending is eerily reminiscent of the ending to Needful Things. The list just goes on and on. If you like Stephen King and you don't mind that the utter lack of originality, go for it. But be warned: I bought it in hardcover and was left unsatisfied. If you need a King ""fix,"" I recommend one of his books from the 1970s - Firestarter, The Shining, Christine... they were original, interesting and eerie stories."
1,Gak. . .,"I've been reading S.K. since 1980: I'm pretty well acquainted with his writing. Sooo. . .This book is really, really bad. The story is SO absurd (WHERE the creatures came from had to be the lowest and most perverse idea S.K. had ever had); I hated every character (wanted them ALL to die after the first few chapters)and the story itself was plodding (it took the characters about a thousand pages to travel from Point A to Point B).This was a book written just to get something new on the shelves.I was very disappointed. I can see the book on my shelf with the bookmark about fifty pages from the end; can't bring myself to finish it.I'm warning everyone away from this one."
1,Did Stephen King REALLY write this?,"I love King books. I do. I was even given the complete uncut version of The Stand as a Valentines Day gift. But this book was (and there's no nice way to say this) utter crap. It didn't even seem like a King book. Maybe some parts did but the writing style was very odd. I do NOT recommend it, not even for die-hard King fans like myself."
3,Not his best,"Shades of the Tommyknockers, vampires, the incubus/succubus approach. His reference to ""The Horror!"" is well taken. References to his other works, tastefully given as in a private joke add to the richness. Well written. Seems to be about madmen dealing with alternative madness. Not as good as most of King's work, but pretty good. King's treatment of children is as good as ever (outstanding, hardly anyone better!). However, the military people (National Guard/Reserve, central to the plot) evidently assigned to run the show (Where are the Active Duty folks?) seem to be mostly portrayed as goons and madmen, which does little to aid the plot. Tom Clancy, he ain't."
3,Long and winding road,"I'm a long time King fan. I've read most of his early stuff, but not much in the last few years. When Dreamcatcher was released and made into a movie, I thought I would give it a shot. IMHO, it's not the equal of King's earlier works. When I read a novel, I read for pleasure, so I read every word. At times I found myself scanning paragraphs and occasionally, entire pages, just to get through them. Overall, I enjoyed the story, but I can only recommend this book to hard core King fans."
2,This Is Not King At His Best,"This book is not King at his absolute best like ""The Talisman"", ""Carrie"", ""Desperation"". The plot is tightly woven as always, stays on the psychotic and narrow, like always, but there's something there that teases the reader. In this novel, King writes like a tired, exhausted writer, barely able to fashion the tip of his pencil into writing a word. Some of the passages seemed forced, like King was prying them out of his head with a dessert spoon! It just seemed remarkably unbelievable. This isn't new for King, but when a homicidal car started terrorizing people (""Christine""), I was a afraid of my Crown Vic's seatbelt, because he made me believe it. But with ""Dreamcatcher"", he failed."
2,What a joke!,"After 30 years of writing, I guess Stephen's ideas are gone? ""Hole in the Wall?"" What is this... Sound's like Stephen wants to write westerns now! For a fresh taste in modern horror, I would suggest the new author Mark Ventimiglia.Mark is possibly the BEST KEPT SECRET OF MODERN HORROR FICTION! His imagination is gripping and his imagery, vivid! There are many stories in his book (THE RESIDENCE) that defy reality! There is a tale of a ring that eats its owners fingers; a story about a house that is possessed by a spirit of cockroaches and it makes a father whig out and slaughter his family using only sandpaper and a wire brush, there is an awsome Lovecraftian type of tale that vividly shows an innsmouth transformation, and a story about a declawed housecat that extracts vengence on its owner for declawing her. There are many other stories here too, and some poetry, as well as cool art work. What this author was thinking when he wrote these pieces is anyones guess! FANTASTIC!"
2,Not his best effort!,"I much anticipated this book but am disappointed. I hope that Stephen King hasn't lost his touch! I am a fan of his work and must say that ""Dreamcatcher"" is my least favorite. The story line had potential but it felt rushed and didn't concentrate on the entertaining aspect of this work. I found myself rushing through this book to go onto the next."
3,dreamcatchers,"This is the first book I have read of Stephen King.If it weren't a necessity for me to read this book for a class I don't imagine ever picking it up and reading it. Im not very fond of science Fiction, however it is still intresting. This book is based on 4 good friends who grew up to have special powers given in each of them. Later on they find out these powers were given for a reason. They go through a Journey in fighting the evil alien and cancerous infection that is being spread to the world. Do they all succeed or not? That is for me to know and you to read and find out."
1,It was co-written...,"Stephen king may have outlined the plot but it was not written totally by him. One of the ""ghost writers"" was English.I read the book but I am getting increasingly bored with the mass produced stuff. Tom Clancey is doing the same thing. Supervising, not WRITING!What does ""fag"" mean in Stephen King's own language?..Who in the US Army would say ""fag"" and why?plus there are gramatical errors that are indicative of a northern england person."
3,Dreamcatcher,"The book Dreamcatcher, by Stephen King, deals with the mind more than any physical trait. Even so, the plot jumps from place to place and left my head spinning. And man, some of the concepts that are stated in this book I have never heard of before. I couldn't really keep up with all of this and had trouble figuring out what was going on. Like the weasel like creature, I would have never thought of that in a million years. Stephen King has a great mind and putes it to use in this book."
4,Read the book but steer clear of the movie,"This book is at once scary,sad,disguisting and disturbing.A true King production.The only thig scary about the movie however is how awful it is."
2,Didn't We Already Read This?,"I am a dedicated Stephen King fan, and I will continue to read his works even after reading this lackluster, disappointment of a novel. Despite my love for King's work, I found this book to be a giant letdown. Just as everyone says about this book, it IS a lousy combination of many great King novels. It's X-Files meets It meets Tommyknockers, without any of the excitement. I had to give it 2 stars, because King writes well as usual, but the plot and the actual story stink. I found myself not caring if the characters lived or died, and instead, simply hoping that the book would end soon. Unless you're a dedicated fan, don't waste your time with this, the worst novel in the King catalog."
1,Awful,"This book is little more than glorified toilet paper.Go buy some Charmin . . . it's softer, the words on the package are more interesting, and it won't burn your a** when you realize you've wasted your money.I'm serious. This book is about aliens that live in your ... and look like red gold, legless weasles. Laugh, it's ok! ... I did! This story has to be a joke. If it is, Mr. King, I salute you for your humor.If you seriously thought this was a powerful work of literature or even a slightly entertaining read, you're a butt weasle."
3,UNDER KING'S STANDARD,"Well, compared to other Stephen King books this is between his worsts. But compared to other books this is a fair read. It's a bit long, you have to read to much and it's not that good for a Stephen King book. Dreamcatcher is a good book but the main problem is that it was written by Stephen King, you know it from the beginning, so you hope for it to be great but no, it's not."
2,Lame,"The setup is by far the best part of this clumsy tale about friendship and aliens. I don't want to give away the plot, but I was hoping that the four (five) friends would stay together and their relationships would deepen. Instead, the story fragments and turns into a tangle of cliches.While King's trademark humor and descriptiveness are present (the reason it even gets 2 stars), and some of the characters are developed well (Jonesy, Henry, Duds), the whole thing reads like something you've read before, only flimsier, more rambling, and less compelling this time around.The Duddits character and the flashback scenes are worth saving. Too bad he couldn't have written a 400 page book and concentrated on that part, and left the little green men out of it."
3,I am sorry but it is BORING,"I really liked Bag of Bones, but I have found this book very boring. King's style of writing seems to favor the first person ie. Bag of Bones but this was not scary-only gross. This genre is everywhere-tv, movies, books so there is nothing new. The characters do go deep, which is great, but that can only take you so far. If you read alot it is worth a try but I can think of better ones."
4,Weird,"I can't call this book a typical King's book. The book discription can mislid you to think there's a connection to ""It"" but it doesn't. the book is about dealing with the past and the present. the book is about a trip gone bad when everyting goes wrong. But in my opinion the book is about King's fighting his own demones. Like in every king's book you can find a character who resamble himself ,and here one of the characters had a resent accidant (like King) and by that his diffrent from everyone els on the planet (to know why you have to read the book , I hate spoilers). so if you want to read somthing more then the ordinary King's book. The reason i gave this just 4 star is that i hate aliens."
1,"Sick, dull, and insulting","Talk about a waste of paper! Shoot, I've read books that left me wanting my money back, but this one left me wishing thay used the paper and ink to print coloring books!Set in the wood, a bunch of guys who once saved a handicapped person from eating a turd are menaced by aliens. Some fungus grows, and a evil/crazy army general runs around playing Rolling Stones tunes, and by the end you no longer care what the point was.I've seen the quality of Kings books as a downward slide after Salems' Lot, so guess this is sort of the literary version of ""Freddy Got Fingered"" In other words, it's so bad, sovile, and so poorly written that people are going to line up to throw more money into King's pockets."
3,Try this on for size,"Robert A. Heinlein captured the battle of the alien body invader vs. helpless mind of the human host much better all the way back in 1951 with his book ""The Puppet Masters"".Give it a try and see for yourself!"
3,Good Start...Weak Ending,"Stephen King's latest work is a tale of redemption that starts out with real promise and originality. The ending is what killed this story for me, and seems to reinforce a pattern over the author's last few novels. Not his best work."
3,one word: ok,"this book had an interesting plot, but it took way too long to get to the point. It would spend like fifty pages explaining boring and inconsequential events and details. Good plot, but 875 pageswas way too long. lots of love!"
2,Hard to follow,"I enjoyed the parts of the book about the four friends and their strange powers, but once Kurtz and his crew came on board, it got hard to follow. It took a long time for the storylines to mesh. The dialogue is Big Steve at his best, but I think the Duddits stuff was a little overdone."
1,Stay away from this one!,"I'll keep this short, no need for a plot summary, just knowthat this book is not worth your time! Luckily, I checked Dreamcatcherout from the library, so I didn't get taken .... I plodded along for300 pages before realizing I was wasting my time and giving up. I haveread every Stephen King book published, and this is his worstever. The writing style is crude and bitter, he must have been on alot of painkillers when he wrote this one. I'll never give up onStephen King, but do yourself a favor and skip Dreamcatcher! END"
2,Slowstarter even for King,"I'm not too excited about this, actually. I thought this one felt a lot in tone and mood as The Tommyknockers, easily the weakest King novel of them all. The punch isn't really packed here, I'd expected more. The first 250 pages were the hardest to get through.I wouldn't compare this to IT. In a sense of scope, it is, but on the whole... I dunno.That multi-angled thingee could have been done sharper. This is just too blunt."
3,Middling King,"Comparing this book solely with King's own works, I'd say this one rates about a C+. Not even close to the sweeping intensity of his most powerful books like ""The Stand"" or the heart-wrenching emotionality of ""Bag of Bones,"" ""Dreamcatcher"" is still a worthy read. While disjointed and unfocused at times, it is still stunningly paced as only King's works can be. Yes, it feels hurried and a bit self-indulgent, but even at his laziest Stephen King's raw talent gives this book enough to sustain it and make it better than 99.99% of what passes for horror or dark fantasy on the literary market."
2,therapy catcher,"Mr. King obviously has a little anger to work out. In the first three chapters of the book, three of the four main characters are in major car acccidents, depressed, suicidal and just plain angry. While most people pay for therapy, Mr. King has obviously discovered a way to foment his anger about the universe and car accidents by writing about his own personal experiences, thinly veiled by the fiction the publisher prints.But the real problem with the book is not the story, the unfairness of the universe or aliens bopping into Maine. The problem of the book is simply that it is an ugly book. Characters in the book display no beauty, speak in an unending stream of four letter words and provide laughs through sophomoric stunts of farting and belching.I truly thought ""The Sixth Mile"" was one of the most uplifting pieces I have read. But obviously, ""Dreamcatcher has not caught the dreams of beauty and truth."
2,A lot of recycled garbage ...,"For the first few pages I entertained the hope that SK might be back to something of his old form. However I soon noticed that no sooner had the story started to get interesting than King would switch away to another storyline, completely killing the suspense. The plot lacks originality and owes a great debt in particular to the Alien films. It is rambling and incoherent and I suspect that without the King name it would have never seen the light of day. He has managed the feat of writing a book which is way way too long yet failing to fill in many important details of the past which are hinted at all the way through the novel. The so-called plot twist at the end was just confusing and left me wondering why I bothered to finish the book."
2,Long,Why always so long. Good story with excellent ideas and some very well written elements. But seriously rambling in places. King seems to believe the quality of his books is proportionate to the length. Disagree.
2,Only a true fan can finish this book,"This book is NOT one of S.K.'s best. He is still a master writer, however the flashbacks every five pages got a little annoying. As always the characters lept off the page, but the plot is left seriously wanting. Don't read this book unless you have major patience and time to kill."
3,"Good, but the ""dream sequences"" dragged on too many times","More of a science fiction book rather than a thriller. The first half is great as he introduces the characters and their lifestyles and the ending is a real page turner too. But Stephen King (as we all know) goes into a 2 to 3 page tangent of totally unrelated memories or dreams or thoughts that have NOTHING to do with the story, or at least, never takes us FORWARD in the story. It was very hard to get through some parts of this, I'd suggest that if you get stuck (like I did many times) in one of his many ""tangents"", just skim it quickly, until you find the real story again. You won't lose the storyline, don't worry."
3,mishmash,"At some point in this long novel King describes the dreamcatcher as a collection of things past, present and future. A perfect description for this work that references the real and fictional from the real world, his past work, and the movies. The best of his work allows us to identify with a character or situation. Only in one aspect, the plight of an accident injured character do we really believe. Mr. King has returned to the long involved works that we have loved in the past, but this time the story feels too drawn out, the alien too gray, the characters cartoonish. Bring on the next one."
2,"Nowhere near "" Stephen King at his best""","After Bag of Bones and Hearts in Atlantis, I was hoping for a truly well written book. I know he is still capable as the Green Mile and Wizard and Glass have proven. So what is this? Not his worst book. Remember Tommyknockers or Needful Things? But certainly nowhere near his best work. There is some great dialogue and neat concepts in this book, but not enough to save it. Wait for the paperback edition and save some money if you really must read it. I will not buy another King book right after it has been released. I am that disappointed."
2,"cobbled together, it's a re-hash of earlier works","I found that this book to be much like other books written by King, and it even mirrors King's apperance in the 80's film ""Creepshow"", in the segment where King himself plays a character who is reduced to the ""Hemingway solution"" when a certain green growth overtakes his person and house like kudzu after a meteor falls. (Sound familiar?) Certain elements from ""Stand By Me"" (the four childhood pals), ""The Stand"" (telepathy and the end-game plot) and of course, ""TommyKnockers"" (aliens who make your teeth fall out) are also re-hashed in this novel. I feel that Robert McCammon's ""Stinger"" is a better novel depicting human-to-alien transformations."
3,Not his best work,"It's a good read, and a decent story. It held my interest through the whole story. It contains the usual twists and character developement you expect from King, but it's not his best work. I'll put it like this: If King is your literature God, read the book. If books about UFO's are your thing, read this book. But if this is your first crack at reading King, I recommend one of his earlier works. That's not to say it isn't a good story. It's just not the same brilliance that produced the Dark Tower series, Misery, or The Stand. It's King, but low grade King. Sorry Buddy."
4,Only For Hardcore SK Fans,"I'm just glad Stephen King is still around to write stories after being so seriously injured when a car hit him. I am a dedicated SK fan and I enjoyed this book, but it isn't on my list of favorites. I thought the most interesting aspect of this story was how SK wove his own experience with a broken hip into the tale. I am one of those readers who prefer mental/emotional weirdness rather than physical weirdness. The ""weasels"", the aliens, and the red fungus didn't impress me, but I did like the characters and their ability to communicate telepathically. It is always King's style of writing that wins me over. Even if the premise or the plot line falls short, the words hold up and draw me irresistibly toward the end. As I said, I enjoyed this book but if you aren't a hardcore SK fan, this one probably isn't for you."
1,Dreamcatcher Ho-Hum,"This is just one more of Stephen King's recent ramblings. It probably has a good plot, but the constant use of ""shock-words"" and vulgarities detracts from a good story. It is way too wordy and could have been written as a novelette such as ""Thinner"". All indications are that this may be my last Stephen King purchase."
4,He's Back!!!,"As many of the reviewers here, I also have read everything King has written. I have not enjoyed many of his later novels, most specifically ""Hearts in Atlantis"", nearly as much as earlier works. However, this book takes me back to the spirit of his earlier works...excellent writing, a pace that won't allow you to put the book down, and weird characters that you like, even at their worst. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it's great having Mr. King back!"
2,"Uninvolving, Disappointing","I eagerly anticipated the new King book as I always do when one of his books comes out. Sadly, ""Dreamcatcher"" was just not up to par. The characters are fairly interesting, but like ""Gerald's Game"" and ""The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon"" there just isn't enough to keep the reader interested.I felt that this book had a lot of potential, but was completely destroyed by rambling writing and tedious attempts to gross the reader out.There was so much more that he could have explored about aliens, but instead this book reads like a pale imitation of ""the regulators""."
2,Thank goodness I only listened while driving,"I have no problem with lengthy and intense narrative or rather good narrative but this book just drones on and on and on - and it isn't the reader - Jeffrey DeMunn does a wonderful job - it is a shame that the material is so poor. I hope that Mr. King has now worked through his demons and that his next book will have a plot. Not up to his usual standards - dull, long and ultimately pointless."
3,Sometimes They Come Back...,"Yes. You've been here before.Read the Tommyknockers? If so, you've pretty much read Dreamcatcher. The story is essentially the same--aliens come and inhabit the bodies of humans, and find the humans tougher than they thought. In the end the aliens lose--but at just the last minute--the last second.The best part of this book is the characters' development and clarity. The plot is overused, and the suspense doesn't build to a sufficient crescendo. The characters, however, are deep and clear and true.Far from his best work, this book is also far from King's worst. If you're a sci-fi buff or a King enthusiast, give this book a try."
2,Dreamcatcher -- A Bad Dream,"Stephen King did his best in the days of ""The Stand"" and ""It."" Lately (the past couple of years or so) he's average, at best. Dreamcatcher was disappointing due to its tired ""flashbacks"" and lack of a moving plot. He's still a master of words and sentence structure, but he's lost his old ""exciting plot"" ability. AND, don't even watch any TV or movie programs in which he was a co-producer!"
3,"Has Potential, but Not Delivered","My review will probably echo ideas many people have given, but they are true: I thought the book was a little bit long and drawn out. The chase scene from Maine to the Quabbin was much too long! The overall premise of the book has potential, kind of an ""alien bodysnatcher"" theme, but I didn't find much to be excited about with the characters, or plot. At least as far as King's standards go. Were it another less prestigous author I might have given it more credit, but King's standards are way too high! Echoed too many plots/themes of past books like ""It,"" ""Tommyknockers,"" and ""The Stand"" for example. Better luck next time Mr. King !"
5,Wonderful!,"For a man recovering from a horrible accident, this book was magnificant! I've read nearly everything SK has written, and this ranks right near the top. Finished it in 2 days. While it's not as gripping as the Talisman, it is definitely a page-turner and a must read for any true King fan."
2,the King has no clothes,"The shame of Stephen King is that he is now a better writer than he was twenty years ago.His characters are much more fleshed out and have infinetely more depth.The problem is that he is flat out of ideas.He has become so predictable and repetitive and melodramatic it is disheartening.Maybe I've read one book too many of King.In fact I've read them all,and this one is down there with ""Christine"",""The Regulators"",""Desperation"" and ""The Tommyknockers"" as the worst and least inspired of his works.I guess King and his genre of writing wear thin once you've passed the age of 14 or so,because that is the last time his work gave me the goosebumps or made me think there was anything profound in his writing.He may be the bestselling writer on Earth,but it is certainly not on the merits of his literary prowess.He has become an institution and lifelong fans will buy anything he releases.I'm an old fan but the old King has become threadbare."
1,Insight on memory in an appalling packaging,"Dreamcatcher is one of his recent books written right after the near-fatal accident where Steve King presented a very interesting concept on how our brain works. Good, if not for the appalling packaging. Snip: (...)"
1,bloated entertainment for flatulence lovers . . .,"I tried. I did. I read 150 pages of this book before growing bored and vaguely repulsed. If you enjoy numerous bloated, over-inflated descriptions of bodily functions (stinky burps and farts), you'll love this book. The characters were dull and poorly defined (I kept mixing them up), the pace was glacial, and the plot dull. And I generally love Stephen King. I think he wrote this as therapy, as one of the characters was recovering from a near-fatal car accident. But it wasn't very entertaining."
4,Dreamcatcher,"The story of four men on a traditional hunting trip, deep in the woods of main, when it takes a horrifying turn. Little do the four men know this could be the last time they would all be together and just how strong their relationship between each other and their life long friend Duddits actually is."
1,dont waste your time,I have read almost all of stephen kings books and of all that i have read this is by far the worst. I could go on and on about how bad it was and why but trust me it is a wast of time. Dont bother.
1,I got lost,"I have read every single book Stephen King ever wrote. Until Dreamcatcher. Around page 300, I gave up. The story of the four friends was very interesting and started to develop but then it sort of got lost in details and cryptic telepathic descriptions. Frankly, sometimes I had no idea, what and who King was talking about.This is such a disappointment and I guess I will think twice before buying more books by Stephen King."
1,Not the sequel we were hoping for,"For months before the release of Dreamcatcher I was crazy with anticipation, certain that Dreamcatcher was a sequel to IT (based on the promotional material, can you blame me?) I was upset when my hopes were dashed (for a while I even tried to convince myself that MAYBE Dreamcatcher was taking place in a parallel world, in which Jonesy is Big Bill's twinner...) Needless to say, this didn't work for long, and I eventually had to come to terms with reality: Dreamcatcher is not very good. What amazed me was that the prologue contains some of King's best writing (I can only assume that the prologue and the rest of the novel were written at separate times). My advice to you is this: read the prologue while enjoying a coffee at your nearest bookseller / cafe. Purchase something else, such as Hearts in Atlantis (which is, in my opinion, one of King's best!)"
2,Not one of his best,"Any Stephen King fan would have to admit tha his past few novels, ""Green Mile"", ""Bag Of Bones"", and ""The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon"" were a sort of renaissance for him. His writing and plotting were in peak form. Unfortunately, ""Dreamcatcher"" fails to keep the streak going. While it starts off fast and furious, it runs out of gas about halfway through. The plot threads seem to unravel at various times. Try as he might, King can't maintain the suspense. Part of the problem may be that he has returned to familiar territory with this novel, and many of his old tricks just don't trick anymore."
2,"alright, what the heck is this","After I was done chugging through this crap, I felt naseous, delirious, and wondering why I just wasted 5 days of my life. Stephen King apparently wrote this while he was recovering from a car accident, and you can definitely tell from the 500 pages of incessant rambling that is a pathetic excuse for character development. The other 200 pages are actually used for good scary plot development, which is not much, but it prevented me from burning this damn thing. In this 700 page monster chalk full of gore and utterly repulsive images, I could sense a trace of good ideas smothered under meaningless words which is why i give this 2 stars instead of 1. To anyone interested in literature: I do not recommend this. To anyone who likes to read about gross things and is good at skimming: do as you wish."
2,Below Average,I wasn't particularly impressed with this novel. I reeked to much like some of his earlier works combined together. It just lacked some of his originality. One of the things I love about Stephen King is his character development. I didn't feel he pulled it off in this novel. I also thought it was pretty gross. Why did there have to be parasitic alien creatures which caused massive burping and farting? Definitely not my cup of tea....
2,Dissapointing,"I'm a huge Stephen King fan, so I always read his works expecting something great about him.And the begining of this novel certainly proved to be amusing and entertaining, but it all drifts after chapter 1, ending in an odd mix of characters and non-sense arguments.Very weak and dissapointing."
2,Not all that Scary!!,"I'm sorry that this book wasn't up to some of the earlier long novels like ""The Stand"" or ""It"". The old formula ,of a group of kids bonding together, as a strong front against evil has worked before.....but not this time. Maybe they're just not that likeable ,so we don't really care what happens to them. I was encouraged ,at one point in the book, when the action returns to good old DERRY ,and a sign is found ,stating ""Pennywise Lives"" and I hoped ,that one of King's finest villians ,would be resurected, but no way! Maybe we'll see him in another tale but I found this one weak !"
3,Average,"I had a hard time liking this book but I also had a hard time hating it. The book started with an interesting premise and then shifted to humdrum storytelling. Don't get me wrong there were several creative aspects, including an interesting pyschological battle. But there wasn't much else. The story seemed to stall and start towards the end, making it a tedious read. King's books are not racing thrillers but this book defied everything his books usually entail. I usually really enjoy the characters and can't wait for the conclusion but this time I might have cared less. In my opinion this book should have been shorter. A lot of complex situations interwoven can leave a reader feeling deeply satisfied when it is all over but this time it all lackd something. If you haven't read all of his other books read one you haven't already, they are better. If you must have it, check it out at the library or wait for paperback."
2,Dreamcatcher Gross Out,"I am an avid Stephan King fan and have read almost everything written by him and I thought this book was horrible. The initial story About the five friends is interesting but the description of the aliens being born out of people's butts is disgusting. I was so grossed out by the persistant description of flatulence accompanying the births too. This was also the most profane of his books with the F word on at least every page and the S word almost as much. It has too many unnecessary characters that are described in detail and then killed off 5 pages later. It was gory, gross, laden with profanity and mental plot lines that didn't make sense. Of course I did finish it being such a fan of his but I would not recommend anybody to waste their time reading this 600+ page book."
5,Amazing,I have not read many Stephen King books and was leary of this one. I really enjoyed it. I was rivited from the start. This book grabs your attention and holds it. The surrounding drama is exciting but it is the underlying personal relationships that really make this book. I hope that no one trys to make a movie out of this book because there is no way to capture the thoughts and background in such a fantastic way. A job well done to Mr. King and I will venture into more of his books now.
2,Not as good as most of his books,"I have always been an huge S.K. fan. I was disappointed in this one, however. It starts out good, but towards the end it becomes long, drawn out and boring. I had to make myself finish it. The concept of the book is good, and had the latter part of the book flowed as easily as the first part, it would have been very good."
2,Too many plots!,"Dreamcatcher has several good plots but it never brings them together into a cohesive whole. The first 80 pages were by far the best of the book, the rest rambles and jumps from story to story. This is novel that doesn't know what it is or what it wants. It could have been a great horror novel. It could have been a great novel about friendship. It just never delivers on the promise of that first 80 pages."
4,Very good....,As someone who loves Stephen King and reads practically everything he writes I have to tell everyone that this ISN'T his best work but then I haven't read anything that would rank as his best for years. So I have to say that this book is exceptional and even with it's rather large size is well worth the ride. If the first few chapters don't thrill you keep reading it DOES get better. Can't wait for his next book....
4,A solid horror title.,"I have almost lost faith in the ""big"" novelists. Writers like Grisham seem to churn out one bad book after another without ever losing their popularity. However, one popular writer who has stayed fairly solid is Steven King. Not everything he has writen in the last five years has been top notch, but I have at least felt I got my money's worth from his books. Dreamcatcher is no exception. A solid horror title mixed in with a great backstory of the 4 men involved. It is loaded with the suspence, horror, and offbeat humor King seems to have a knack for. This book is highly recommended."
2,I couldn't finish it,"I really, truly wanted to love this book. I have been reading Stephen King since the late '70s and always look forward to anything new by him. I could only get through 300 pages before I just had to give up. I reached the point where there were three Jonesys and then I realised it was time to throw in the towel. King is best when he does straight horror and Sci-fi is not my favourite genre, but this book was kind of muddled and kept jumping all over the place. I think that this story would have benefited by being 200 pages less and not delving so deeply into the whole psychological thing. Anyway, I will continue reading Mr. King's books, but just can't really recommend this one."
1,To put it nicely....,"This book really stunk. It almost seems like he forgot to send the manuscript to the editor. Surely the editor wouldn't have let him ramble on and on about snow, and trees, and oh-my-god the smell and sound of the bodily functions of these ""people"". I vowed that I would never again rush to the store to buy one of his books because they have been so diappointing, but I did this time because it was tauted as ""a return to horror"". I now once again vow to NEVER rush out to buy his books. The used bookstore will have plenty of his stinkers for 50 cents in the future."
2,"First ""King"" book I regret buying!","I have been reading Stephen King books since discovering ""The Stand"" at the age of 14. (over 20 years now) But this is the first one that I would even consider returning. I kept thinking that it would get better and it never did. While there were some good parts, there were certainly not enough. I just hope that this was a result of too much time since the last book and the ol' writing skills were a little rusty. I look forwarded to the next one. Everyone deserves a second chance."
4,"A little long, but worth the time...","I'm a huge Stephen King fan, and was anxious to read his first novel written after his accident. I can say that although it was not my favorite, it was very, very good.Some of the critics have slammed King's ""diarrhea of the typewriter"" in this book. It was a little long, and dragged in the middle quite a bit, but still was not predictable, and I was quite satisfied by the ending.My husband and I listened to this book at the same time. He became a little more frustrated than I did with the psychological drama in the middle of the book, and was anxious for the action to start up again. I found the ""mental"" struggles more interesting, and wasn't as bored by the middle of the book.Jeffrey Demunn is absolutely superb! His Maine accent is perfect for the story, and his characterizations were flawless.King has definitely not lost his touch. Dreamcatcher is a must-read for Stephen King fans."
2,FALLS BELOW EXPECTATIONS,"The more time that passes since reading this book, the more disappointed I am. Although a fast and compelling read, I can't shake the feeling that all I've done is read the outline of a much better book.Readers will naturally draw comparisons to ""IT"" because of the life long friendship, anchored by a life changing experience in adolescence, of the four main characters. But what King did with such skill and beauty in ""IT"", drawing us into the make up of the individuals as well as the group dynamic, he merely pays lip service to in ""Dreamcatcher"". King sets us up with the key elements, but fails to deliver. We get only one course of the meal King has taught us to expect.This book made me want to re-read ""IT"", which I am currently doing with great pleasure."
2,Think About This,"There are over 100 reviews already here, so I won't go over the same old stuff. Every true King fan might want to ponder this idea for a moment - doesn't it seem as if King has lost touch with ""real people"" as his fame has grown? His early books were great, but as he has grown older and richer, his fame may be causing him to lose touch with reality as the rest of us ""worker bees"" see it, and his writing has suffered from it. He's tucked away in a mansion in a small town in Maine, with not much exposure to the outside world. Also, Stephen knows, and so do we, that anything he writes will become a bestseller. So he doesn't have to really worry about pleasing the reader anymore - he knows it will sell a trillion copies and he'll get even richer. I will continue to read his books, but I'll get them from the library - I'm not paying a cent for these crummy stories anymore."
2,DREAMCATCHER,"DREMACATCHER---2 STARSI couldn't wait to read this one. The first 200 pages were SOOOOO good....I was hooked....then I don't know what the happened...king was all over the place, I was kind of lost at around the 300 page mark. Then I realized why, it's because the story/writing was just falling apart. Like a snow cave melting in the warm summer sun....there was all kind of stuff going on, and in a way where it was easy for the reader to get lost...lost and lost QUICKLY.....its a shame...I read 300 pages of this book, and I had enough....I was falling asleep after 10 pages....I said ""good bye"" and benched it....I have recently been reading MISERY and I CANNOT put it down....I have been up the past 2 nites reading it and it will be finished tonite.....STAY AWAY from DREAMCATCHER!!!!! This book is only for the PUREST of fans and that have EXTREME patience....even for those people, I can promise you this....you will be counting down the pages to the end!!"
2,How can I say?,"Stephen KIng is a master writer. Reading his books, however, may be an exausting experience, since he frequently writes a lot, I mean a lot, of unecessary pages. BUt, most of the times, he does it showing that he's really a gifted writer.But in DREAMCATCHER things somehow go wrong. It's a hard book to read, even if the chemistry among the four old friends from Derry, more Duddits, was something very enjoyable to follow. But he kept developing unecessary histories to the plot. Case in point: the Russian woman who throwed herself into the water depository. Useless, simply useless stuff to the main plot.This is one King book trhat I kept struggling to reach the end."
3,"If this is ""The Old King"" I like the new one.","Dreamcatcher was a good story, but I expect my fiction to do more. I read fiction for the applications it can make in my own life and I felt like Dreamcatcher left me hanging. I wanted a revelation on life...just one. Nothing really connected however. People keep telling me that I should read King's older stuff because his recent material just doesn't measure up. I am told this is a throwback to the old stuff. Well, I have enjoyed everything since 1990...but if this is the ""good stuff"", I'll stick to the ""bad""."
1,Steven King's Worst Book,Just a very short review but I thought I had to do it. This is Stephen King's worst book and the only one I have been unable to finish. I loved his last four books. It's a good job you can return books at Amazon.com.
1,What The ...,THIS BOOK ... SO MUCH ... I mean if you wanna waste you ... summer reading this book then go ahead. See what this book has taught me? NO just kiddin it was good.
1,Does he always write drivel,"My mother was always a big fan, but I've never been intersted to read any of his books (esp after seeing his films). After hearing what this book was about I thought I would give it a go & was bitterly dissapointed. I found as I should have expected (just like his films) a subject with great potential just wasted. I can see this one being made into a film one day. Try Simon Ings - Headlong. Its not 100% either but it was definatley better than this, although it is not horror but sci-fi."
3,Author of Fragmented Recollection,"I am kind of disappointed in this book. I miss the page turners that Stephen King usually writes. It's obvious that King is a fan of Beavis and Butthead. I'm only half way through the novel, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to finish the rest. So far I'm not on the edge of my seat."
4,Excellent story but!,"I am a King fan and have read most of his books. I really enjoyed this book, especially the history these men had growing up and as others have written Duddits. My only complaint with this story was that it could have been told equally as well minus all the profanity!!"
3,Below average for Mr. King,"In my opinion, Dreamcatcher is below average for Mr. King. The characters are not likeable; the plot is silly; and the book drones on and on. Indeed, had Mr. King shorted this book by 300 pages, it would have improved it.I'm a fan of Mr. King's writings, but this isn't a book I enjoyed."
3,or maybe just 2 & 1/2,"I've been a King fan for years (through all the ups & downs)and although I found the book quite entertaining,(once you get started you just HAVE to know what comes next)I felt extremely let down at the end.All the build up & momemtum,only to be told at the end,no big deal,the Aliens are'nt really dangerous & would have died on their own!?!?! definitely a let down. I sometimes enjoy his intense attention to detail,but in this case,it seemed to go on & on taking forever to get to the point.If you like Mr.King,it's worth a read,but no need to rush"
1,Boring!!!!!!,"I have been a Stephen King fan for years and loved his earlier books. This one is a disaster. I kept trying to read it but finally gave up. I think he has lost his ability to write great books such as The Stand, Carrie, Pet Sematary, Salem's Lot and other earlier books. Luckily I got this book as part of an introductory offer for membership in a book club. I'm glad I didn't spend much money on it."
2,SSDD,"I am a big SK fan, but this is just IT meets TOMMYKNOCKERS .. I loved both of those novels, but DREAMCATCHER is kind of tired stuff. I started to lose interest with the first falling tooth - been there, done that. Duddits is an intriguing character; in fact, I liked all of their gang, but the book just didn't hold my interest."
4,Dreamcatcher,King's back again! Enter the world of four individuals who are annually reunited by their childhood memories. While having their hunting reunion they stumble upon a disoriented stranger who is a host for an alien-like creature. This creature raises havoc upon the woods. The only hope for their survival lies in the memories of the past!
3,Potty humor?,"There is some great characterization here--""Duddits"" is excellent, and his mom even better. But, I'm not so sure I need repeated, detailed descriptions of how these ""byrus"" inplants effect victim's gastrointestinal tracts. I mean, come on--we get it!The plot moves like a snowcat in a snowstorm, with equally unsure footing. I'm accustomed to humoring the author, but I think my patience was tested a little.I want to be scared--not totally grossed out!"
3,Too much work,"The story line was pretty good -- aliens crash-landing on earth and spreading a deadly disease. However, trying to follow the story as it weaves through all the telepathic messages, flashbacks and mental gymnastics of the characters is just too much work to be enjoyable. The book could have been 350 pages instead of 900 and would have been much more enjoyable."
5,Joyeux Noel,"It is an excellent performance from the film. The music is delightful and can be played anytime of the year inspite of Adeste Fidelis, Stilla Nacht, etc. It has it's classical and popular themes.Augie Aleksy"
3,Movie was good but...,"I thought the movie was good, but I was disapointed with the rating. I think the sexual scene was downplayed in the PG13 rating, i.e. ""a little bit of sexual nudity""..I would not want any children watching that scene, it was obvious sexual intercourse.I think it should have had an R rating instead.I was very disappointed with the rating"
5,A Magnificent Children's Book,"A wonderful story about a boy and his father and their adventures in farawayland. A bed time reading classic every child will treasure. Very hard to find, but a must for any library as children will love this book even when they grow up - I know I do. Also highly recommended by Astrid Lindgren is The Brothers Lionheart."
5,One of my all time favorites!,I had forgotten about this book until someone just asked me to name my favorite book. I read this book again and again as a child and found it absolutely entrancing. I highly recommend it to anyone who dreams of living in a fantasty world of their own.
5,Back in print June 2003!,"Purple House Press is proud to have reissued Mio, My Son in June of 2003 and The Brothers Lionheart in March 2004!"
3,could use some improvement,"the edge of this device needs some improvement. the better lash curlers have curved metal/rubber edges which give a nice curl to lashes. with the seki, because of its mediocre tip construction, simply crimps the lashes at a hard angle. not very pretty. if you press hard enough, you could almost snip your lashes.the compact design is nice. it doesn't have any bars on the side(like most spot curlers)-which is nice, because it doesn't leave awkward gaps or ruin the lashes that have already been curled."
5,1967 heaven,"Do we really need another Yo la Tengo? Or Velvet Underground tribute band 30 years on? Well, actually yes we do. In a world of bland (at least here in the UK) 1979 new wave copyists ((r)kaiserlightviewchiefs godawfulness) we have to look to you dear cousins for inspiration. This is simply beautiful. I can't add much to Tom B's review below but if you don't melt to There are too many Birds or Flashing the Lobby Lights or the most obviously Velvets influenced 1,000 Words you're a heartless beastie or a razorlight fan or tone deaf or all three.Comparison warning: If you like Essex Green, Apples in Stereo, Yo La Tengo, Delgados, Eels, REM and that ilk you're bound to swoon. I did and I haven't left the floor since."
1,over-hyped,"C'mon. I wanted to like this. I love primitive music, from the Sonics to the Ramones. But the Shaggs music is beyond primitive. It's garbage. And it's not of the ""it's so bad, it's good"" variety. It's so bad, it's terrible."
3,Alternately incredible and flaccid,"Often called the worst rock and roll record ever made, I bought this out of curiosity and was quite surprised. It's not half bad, once you get used to the out-of-tune guitars and wavering vocals. But some of the songs(like ""It's Halloween"" and ""Painful Memories"")have a special magic, a plaintive kind of nostalgic melancholy. My favorite track is the live ""Gimme Dat Ding"", which sounds like it was recorded at the YWCA on a busy summer afternoon(it was actually a town hall in New Hampshire). A very peculiar listening experience, but well worth it for fans of the bizarre."
4,Memories...,"Ah... listening to the dulcet tones of the Shaggs.The harmonies, the guitar solos and lyrics - so pure, and untainted by the bitter world we know today.It takes me back to my youth.I remember the joy as I tore off the coloured paper that Christmas morning to reveal my first ever six-string guitar. It was a sunburst Gibson copy. I was just 12 years old.I remember picking it up for the first time. It seemed very heavy and the metal strings hurt my fingers.And I also remember that, by the time the Queen was making her Christmas speech that afternoon, I sounded better than the Shaggs."
1,Don't bother,"If you've heard a bit about the Shaggs and are intrigued there are two things to do.1) Listen to the sound clips offered by Amazon2) Read the fascinating article in the September 27, 1999 issues of THE NEW YORKER magazine.Beyond that.....well, there really is nothing left. Don't bother spending your money on this. I may be amusing the first time you her it, but there are better uses for your fifteen bucks."
1,What in the ....,"How can any of you people honestly think this qualifies as music? This ""music"" does not grow on you. As if listening to it more than once is even appealing to anyone with any musical taste or talent.This stuff is not so bad that it is good. It's just flat out excrement. Did they just pick random words out of a dictionary and put them together to form lyrics? I have met parakeets with a more defined vocabulary.The fact that people have actually purchased this piece of garbage makes me weep for the future. And scarier than that, some of them liked it, and then gave it 5 stars! I have lied awake at night with the song ""My Pal Foot Foot"" haunting me like a Stephen King story.I came close to destroying my entire CD collection, and breaking my own ear drums with a knitting needle. I can't believe this exists. Worse yet, I actually had to give it 1 star to be able to post a review. Sad indeed."
1,Get Real,"All evidence indicates that the Shaggs were a case of three daughters being browbeaten by their domineering father, Austin Wiggin Jr., intro becoming a hit girl band, whether they particularly wanted to do it or not. Some lyrics were written by the parents but credited to the sisters to beef up the illusion they were a regular group. You folks getting into the ""innocent self-expression"" of the Shaggs should think about all this. At the very least you should feel bad snickering at them ever again."
1,Sound Clips Will Do,"The hipsters can praise this all they want, but they KNOW it's crap and praising it just helps in their desperate desire to feel so smug and superior to mere mortals. I can guarantee you that few of them actually own a Shaggs album and of those that do few ever listen to it. This applied to Zappa too.Sure, it has a sincerity missing in so much of today's music, but sincerity alone does not make music (and I use the term loosely) listenable. Intrigued by this band's story? That's understanding, it is a fascinating one. But if you still feel a need to hear this stuff save yourself a lot of dough and go with the sound clips. They'll tell you everything you need to know."
1,Boring and pretentious,"I know for a fact that this joker was indeed incompetent, and arrogant as well. it is too bad this clown tries to drag down others when he should slink away and crawl under the rock that he came from."
4,A great insider's look,"Jett's account of the Kidder Peabody scandal provides an insider's look at the racism, greed and sexism prevalent on Wall St. His story seems to have merit because Jett openly talks about his own personality faults, (some he does not seem to be aware of himself). He is conceited & greedy, but I think he is honest, intelligent and hardworking. Jett was truly a victim."
4,I can't wait for the movie or made for TV mini series.....,"This story reveals the ugly side of human nature and racism at the highest levels of finance on Wall Street. Jospeh Jett has reveal to us that in a world where only the numbers you produce should be used to measure your performance, for minorities, rarely is it only criteria used."
4,Excellent Stuff!,"Mr. Jett, while not being the most likeable person, gets it right about corporate America and its relationship with Black America. He comes off a little arrogant and I think is a little out of touch with the issues of race in America. In a perfect world we should only be judged by our smarts and talents, but that just does not happen. However, I have experienced many of the things Mr. Jett writes about in his book. The corporate in-fighting, racism, and arrogance of surperiors makes it twice as hard for talented black americans to make it in the corporate world. The book itself was very captivating and easy to read. Mr. Jett is not completely innocent here. His greatest crime was collaborating with his surperiors and expecting them to stand by him. It is a valuable lesson for any worker to learn."
5,Big Business's control of the media is FRIGHTENING!,"Jett makes a clear case on how big business fashions the truth through their control of the media. Each time I look at MSNBC and realize that Microsoft and GE are in bed together determining what is newsworthy for us to hear, I tremble. This book is riveting and a must read."
5,Must read book. Hard to put it down!,"Though it is not completely clear who is at fault for this huge mess, I beleive both Jett and numerous kidder employees should share the blame. Either way, the book was fast and exciting to read. I'm glad I bought and read it."
3,Half the book is worth reading.....,"After reading the book, and hearing Mr. Jett's account, I don't think he committed fraud. I believe that he thought he had a winning trading strategy, and he held his cards close to his chest. Mr. Jett way over traded his portfolio limits, and of course his system was flawed. In the end Mr. Jett distroyed Kidder Peabody. Through out the book Mr. Jett talks about sex, race, and white women; but this is all meant to be a smoke screen of the facts."
4,Who's telling the truth? I still don't know.,"I'm an I-banker and former CPA. I read this book and still can't tell who's right. More than likely as with most arguments, the truth is somewhere in the middle.Jett builds a great case of his bosses setting him up but when someone works this hard at it, I become very suspicious. He does have some very creditable points that his bosses knew or should have known what his accounting practices were. Employee of the year to criminal? Where was internal audit?Basically, this book allows you to hear one side of the story for you to draw your opinions from. I'm not sure what is correct but I enjoyed the read and see one more time the ""ego filled"" life of Wall Streeters."
1,Pathological Liar Cons Publisher and Self,"As a person close to much of that described in the book, I can say that Joe Jett is completely deluded. Additionally, it stuns me that such a poorly written fantasy has been promoted heavily let alone published at all. Were it not for the comic value that exists for me as someone who knows much of the reality re. all of this, I would not have graced this piece of trash with more than a very few moments of my time."
4,Excellent account of Wall Street incompetence and greed,"Excellent read, finished in one day. Jett and Kidder seem to both be in the wrong. After being a ranked research analyst who also brought a $40m investment deal in and was let go three weeks after because of incompetent management that lent out to much money in Indonesia, I applaud Jett for standing up to make his case. At the very least, his management should have endured the same scrutiny of regulators but somehow the big money ""swinging dicks"" find a scapegoat."
5,Classic Pot Head Humor by the Masters,"This album has a lot of very cool Cheech & Chong routines on it. They are classics of the genre, and much funnier than some of the stuff that shows up in their films.My sister had it when she was in High School, and I used to borrow it. The vinyl album had a great pull out sleeve that showed all the hidden drugs in compartments in the VW Bug on the cover.I recommend it to anyone who enjoys this kind of humor, wants a blast from the past (70s style), or just wants to check out Cheech Marin before he went 'respectable' and straight (drug-wise). I can't wait to listen to it again, this time on CD."
4,Well written historical novel,"Nineteenth and early twentieth century writers, if they were good, were usually quite good at description and establishing time and place. Benson is one of the good ones. He writes of a time little visited in the imagination, the late 17th century and describes England under Charles II. Particularly, he describes the situation of Catholics and their hope for equal footing with the ruling Protestants. The politics, religious issues, the society are well portrayed. Like most early 20th century writers, Benson's pace is slower than the novelists of today. With patience, the reader will be rewarded."
5,I love this album!!!!,"This album is pure magic. Ella is in great, great form, she swings more than ever with her clear, impeccable voice. Basie's accompaniment is solid and swinging as usual. Your feet or fingers will be tapping along unwittingly to the rythm all the way and you'll be smiling all the while. A class act."
5,The album that made me a jazz fan,"This vocal album broke forever my obsession with any music recorded after 1965. The year after I graduated high school, I was given this as a gift by a friend, and I looked at the cover and thought: ""Where can I exchange this for something good?"" Fortunately, I opened it, played it, and lost my mind for the next month. A hot, swinging session, full of intense emotion, gleeful play, and ravishing talent. I have been in love with Ella ever since; I own almost all of her recordings; I named my daughter after her. If that doesn't convince you to buy this classic, I have wasted my time writing this."
1,Super Bark Free,"Either my neighbor has totally deaf dogs or this product does not work. The neighbor's dogs constantly bark all night long with the Super Bark Free only three feet away. I have tried all sorts of settings and while my cat will immediately bolt and run from the Super Bark Free when it activates, the neighbor's dogs are completely unaffected. Maybe they should re-name this product the Super Cat Free."
1,Super Bark Free,"So far, the Super Bark Free has been 100% ineffective and I would like to return it."
4,Good buy for the money,"I needed a way to hold change and had seen these change purses in the past so i thought id give it a try. It works as advertised. I have had it for alittle over a month and no signs of wear/tear yet (though I'd hope not). Not much more to say, considering the price you get more than you pay for."
4,Convenient,"I like to carry my cash in my pocket when possible. A purse is a pain. So this is very nice for a few bills and lots of coins. It's a bit of a bear to open until you understand how. You open at the sides rather than squeeze. So it doesn't actually work the way it's designed to --- at least not well. But that's a small issue and this is a nice, well made product that should last a long time. It's easy on the pocket --- no bulge. And it's handy."
2,"Sharp hinges, no attach points.","The leather on this coin purse is nice and it's a perfect size - my problem with it is that the hinges that you squeeze on the edges are exposed and rather sharp. I ended up punching a hole in it and attaching a keyring, which worked fine. I tried squeezing the hinges with a pair of pliers to round the edges and ended up breaking the hinge (my problem, not the product's) This product would easily get 4 stars if there was a small strip of leather covering the hinges and 5 stars if it had covered hinges and a keyring attachment."
1,not adequate quality,This pouch arrived already torn of damaged at the corner. This kind of item takes a lot of opening and closing wear and this one would not last long at all.
4,Practical Product in a world on glitz and electronics,"This is just a practical little item that helps a person keep organized; not a one pocket on a fold-up whatever of thirty pockets, just something to keep coins together. Great to have inthe car, the pocket, or the briefcase. Recommend for anyone who hates fishing around for a quarter."
3,Not crazy about this purchase,"This is an old style key pouch with the key ring in side of it that you can transform into a coin pouch. Not exactly what I was looking for, but it does work O.K."
3,Useful Product But lack of Quality,A very useful coin pouch for travelling. The leather is fined but the squeeze string isn't tight enough especially after active usesses.
5,Great product!,"I got this for a gift for my dad he loves it! It's still in great condition and I received it sooner than expected. Overall, well worth it!"
4,Coin caddy,"Size is just right to carry pocket change. I looked in 6 stores to find one, but either found none or ones too bulky for convenient use. I also keep two extra keys in event I were to lose my belted key chain clip."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"Functionally it works as described, but the material seemed very cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for. That would be fine, but the material really smelled. I tried to wash it, but the smell stuck around on the material so I have a distrust of using it with my hands."
1,Squeeze coin Pouch,Nice leather. The squeeze portion broke immediately and I was never able to use it. Overall not a well designed product.
1,Not the same coin purse,"I previously bought some coin purses similar to what is pictured. What I got looks similar but, not the same product. For one, there is a ring inside which if you pull out keeps the coin purse somewhat open and coins could fall off. The ring inside the purse is a hazard which could result in your fingers getting hooked by that said ring. I will cut off the stupid ring which does not serve a useful purpose for a small coin purse. Will avoid dealing with this company. If you do not have the exact same product then, do not switch products without asking the customer. Considering the cost of the items, returning it would be pointless and not cost effective."
2,"Good, but not good enough.","The service was good, but I was not happy that it was necessary. Barely three weeks after the arrival of the coin pouch, one of the hinges BROKE. The company responded well to my e-mail, and sent a replacement - which just arrived. IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN IF THIS IS A SATISFACTORY OUTCOME.."
1,I already wrote a review on this product.,"the metal cladps stick out on the end of the purse and dig into your fingers when you try to open it up. Its quite obvious that nothing will be done about this, so doin't waste time asking to write a review"
3,Coin Pouch from Amazon is just ok,I recently purchase some pants that did not have a pocket to hold change. I needed something to hold my change.I did a search on Amazon and found these pouches. I ordered two of these and found them to be hard to open. The metal mechanism used to open and close the pouch does not work very well.I would not recommend this item.
3,Now where did I put that change?,"Somewhat less quality than the one it replaced. Not real leather, which was disappointing, but what I spent on the product could easily fit in the pouch!"
4,Quick shipping; good buy for the money,"I bought this as a gift for a family member whose coin pouch is so well-worn that that closure bracket no longer works. Pleased that this arrived even sooner than expected. Quality is reasonably good for the price.My only reason for choosing four rather than five stars is that the closure bracket is really stiff. I had to use a pen or coin edge to force it open a little, then could use the bracket itself. My elderly family member has less grip strength than I do. So may have more trouble opening it routinely. But hopefully that will ease with use."
3,I still can't dance worth a damm,"It was inspiring watching them dance. I guess you have to REALLY want to learn and be dedicated to get it. I bought this when dancehall was poppin in the states. Now, it's just apart of my collection....collecting dust."
3,not enough,"The dvd was alright. There was not enough of the instructional dance part for me. They talked about some of the dances, but I wished they would have showed them. I really liked the part of the dvd that showed how creative people are with the dances."
1,Disappointment!,"You'd think that, Ma being my favourite cellist and Williams being my favourite composer of this century, this album would be at least a semi-hit (with me, anyway)... But it's not great -- at all. Some parts are almost boring, others are too demanding of the listener's attention (not in a good way). I am quite disappointed with this CD! Could've been amazing!!! If you love what you know of Williams, you might want to take a sneak preview before buying... it's not his average stuff! No knocks on either musician -- just not at all their best work!"
2,"Great sound, shame about the music","Absolutely spectacular sound, - the cello has warmth and bit and at times the timpani make you want to jump out of your seat. Having said that, thats all there is. The music is bloated, dull, repetitive and uninteresting. Either full of sound and fury, signifying nothing or else moodily quiet in pseudo-profound style, but signifying just as little. A sonic spectacular, but only if you aren't interested in (the) music."
1,Wow - Certainly not the Grammy Music we heard from Ma,"When buying this CD I expected the same type/style of music I heard when Yo-Yo Ma played the theme from ""The Patriot"" at the Grammys. What I got was definitely not what I expected - somewhere between the vocal cacophony in the first part of ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"" and a Berg piece - not quite just noise, but definitely atonal.Amazon needs to refine its recommendation list since this one showed up as something I'd like. I enjoy Yo-Yo Ma as one of the finest cellists performing today, and have heard him live with Emmanuel Ax, and I usually go to a movie that has a John Williams score even if the story doesn't look like something I'd enjoy. Unfortunately, this looks like asparagus and chocolate sauce - I like each individually, but the combination doesn't look appetizing."
2,Painful,Listening to this is about as much fun as drilling teeth.The music sounds as if it is played off-key. It seems at times to actually hurt the ears and emotions.Two stars for attempts to sound good.
1,Yo-Yo Ma and John Williams missed the boat,"I have been a huge John Williams fan for over 25 years and I am a recent Yo-Yo Ma fan. The new cd ""Yo-Yo Ma plays the music of John Williams"" was an extream dissappointment. I did not like one song on that CD. Use your money to purchase other John Williams music or Yo-Yo Ya music."
4,Classic John Williams non-movie music,"If you like John Williams' movie scores and like modern classical music, you will enjoy this CD. If you like his movie music then you *might* enjoy it. The Cello Concerto is particularly entertaining. The music is a great example of the master orchestrator at his best, where he finds invents some good themes and hangs the orchestra around them It's similar in quality to his other ""for the concert hall"" pieces that I know (particularly his Violin Concerto and Bassoon Concerto). The CD leaves me with one question in my mind: Why wasn't a well-known orchestra used? The name of the orchesta (which I've never heard of) leads me to believe that the composer used an pickup orchesta normally used to record by the studios to record film scores."
3,Legend of Old BEFANA,the story was nice but you need to be very careful or you will damage the spine of the book. Not worth the price .
2,shafi,I have been looking for a book for my children to share thorugh illustrations and imagination the stories of my childhood when it came to the Legend of the Old Befana. I found this to be the closest so far yet it does not follow through on the tradion that follows the Befana each year in Italy. It did not captivate my our my son and I found myself having to more explaining than sharing The drawings are nice though.
2,My Old Befana Book,"My children in my preschool class was so excited to read about ""Old Befana"" during our study of Italian Christmas, however, when reading the book it was the quality dissappointed me.The spine of the book was bound so tight is was hard to open, it cracked, and was hard to hold open during oral reading. If I had time before out school's culture presentation, I believe I would have returned it. In the past I have always received good quality maybe this was good qaulity but bound too tight. Thanks for the opportunity for my review.Janice Payne"
2,"""The Postman rings once""","This book left me with a feeling of sadness and without sympathy for the main character.Too much wallowing in self pity for me.I also was surprised by the mistakes in grammer, spelling, etc., either made by the author or missed by the editor.I wouldn't recommend this book to any of my friends.We live about 5 miles from Bodega Bay, and I enjoyed reading about the town."
2,"Of all the PPVs they could have packed together, they chose these?","I don't want to be mean, but Backlash and JD '03 were not ""classics"" by any stretch of the imagination. Coming off a great WrestleMania, WWE was entering one of its worst and most boring post-Attitude periods, especially on the RAW side of things. But if you want to see how lame things were getting by the spring of 2003, I guess this is the cheapest way to do it."
3,Not as good as Rebecca,"In true duMaurier fashion the books begins slowly but hang on- it gets pretty good! The storyline isn't quite the same calibur as ""Rebecca"", my favorite novel, but well worth reading."
3,three stars,The book was not bad but I think the author wrote too much about the letters which Philip had found. I am sure that the last chapter was the best part of the book. I don't like the part in the middle very much because it was lenghty and quite boring. I found it a little bit sad that Philip hadn't seen his cousin Ambrose before he died. But all in all the story was interesting.
2,my cousin rachel,"First time Amazon shopper. I was looking for the book, and did not realize this was a short play format until I received it. Too much hassle to return it for the cost. I'm better off going to the second hand book stores."
3,Disappointing Du Maurier,"As a huge fan of Du Maurier, I was generally unimpressed by this novel in comparison to her others, such as Rebecca, The Scapegoat, Jamaica Inn, and The House on the Strand. I find Du Maurier wonderful, if inconsistent, alternately delivering atmosphere, thrills, and unusually gripping late-night storytelling. This novel promises all of the above, but ultimately delivers an unsatisfying ending that leaves the reader feeling the story was somehow derailed at its high point. If the benefit of a melodramatic period piece is an un-put-downable book, My Cousin Rachel doesn't make the grade. Stick to some of Du Maurier's other works."
3,"Does not live up to ""Rebecca""","I'm a huge fan of Du Maurier and her work, but I was not overly impressed with this one. The character development is great, but the plot lacks a true climax...some twists and turns but I found myself wanting more of the drama of previous novels, like Du Maurier's masterpiece ""Rebecca"". I would suggest reading Frenchman's Creek or Jamaica Inn over My Cousin Rachel."
4,My Cousin Rachel,"I usually don't enjoy books written from a male point-of-view, but this one just kept getting better & better. The ending was GREAT! At times, I loved Rachel, &, at times, I hated her."
3,Interesting Read,"I bought this book for the sole purpose of getting Carnegie Deli recipes, particularly the brisket recipe. Turns out it is a really basic recipe you can get anywhere. Nice to have on the shelf though for reference."
4,Space jazz !,"A brilliant strange album that is very spacy. This is probably not a album for old school jazz puritans, it's a album for those who want more. Sun Ra looks like his music, that is very wired, in a positive sence. He gives his musicians complete freedoom. You can hear the musicians really enjoing themselves in the way they play. A chaotic album in a chaotic world !"
4,good place to get a taste of avant-garde sun ra.,"there are a lot of sun ra albums that i love, and a lot of them that i cannot stand. the pretentious avant-garde ones tend to fall into the second category. this one, though avant-garde in nature, is actually very listenable. featuring a lot of fantastic sax work from john gilmore, this is a great place to dip your feet into sun ra's freaky side. the great john coltrane was a huge fan of john gilmore, and it's easy to figure out why. the compostions on this album are 'out there' in nature, but yet easy to reach with your heart. i recommend this to those with a taste for musical adventuring."
1,"Committing Self Abuse With ""Punishing Savagery""!!!(A Quote)","I had to read this book in my Final Year at High School and I didn't like it one bit. Now it is 25 years later and I re read it and found I didn't like it anymore the second time around. The protagonist describes his early life in Melbourne as a boy and how he became obsessed with masturbation in his early teens.He seems to have a fascination with homosexuality as can be seen by an early incident in this book.As a consequence of his twisted personality he becomes a teacher where he enjoys the attention of a ""captive audience"" namely his students.I am very glad that most Australian Writers do not reminisce about their early life if it was sad and pathetic as this author's was.Read this book if you want to be disgusted and appalled by the pathetic life of this loser."
5,Watch it!,"The greatest horror film of its era, hands down, and it puts today's slasher films to shame with its intelligence and atmosphere. Karloff is as wonderful as he was in ""Frankenstein,"" but in a radically different role. Don't miss it!"
3,The Mummy,"Boris Karloff in The Original, it is not a Horror movie in the ultimate sense but it is worth watching As Only Karloff can Deliver and the eerie face and look adds to The Mummy."
4,"Not to be confused with ""The Mummy's Hand""","The other reviews are pretty extensive but I just have to add that this is NOT the movie where tana leaves reawaken the well- known foot- dragging man-strangling mummy's-curse monster. THAT movie is ""The Mummy's Hand"", with Dick Foran and Tom Tyler. This is a considerably different affair with the rather suave former mummy, Imhotep aka Ardath Bey, played by Boris Karloff in one of his better speaking horror roles."
4,"Mummy is Classic, but resembles Original Dracula(30)","If you took this film and interchanged it with the charcaters from Browning's Dracula of 1930....well just a thought.Edward Van Sloan is the doctor who again insists that""we mus destroy it! David Manners is the romantic lead.Film really does resemble Lugosi Dracula(30). Karloff and Jack Pierce spent hours and hours with make up sessions and we only see the mummified mummy for a quick minute or two!However, the real terror and chills comes from Karloff's performance as the unmummified revived Ardeth Bey who is just as menacing as the ""mummy"". I liked the opening scenes best involving the archeologists at the 1920s dig site headquarters.Film tends to prod along at a slow pace, but is still good Universal creaky horror."
3,This movie was supposed to be a horror film?,The directors didn't really achieve in making this move scary. (except for the man eating bugs) It had a good story line and a few jokes. Definetely don't watch this if you are looking for a horror movie.
5,Classic!,Classic horror and the disc really helps convey the way it was filmed and is supposed to look like to appreciate classic horror
3,A hybrid that didn't quite work,"There were some scary and funny elements in this film, but there were not enough of either of them to highly recommend the movie. Brendan Fraser's performance annoyed me, probably because I had just watched ""Gods And Monsters"" a couple of days earlier. He had to act in that one. That wasn't a requirement for this film."
1,Totally overated,"I like those classic old horror movies, like Frankenstien, the wolfman, the invisble man,etc.But this moviewas absolutley boring. It had a good opening scene in the start of the movie, when Karloff's mummy first comes to life, but after that he becomes a regular man and than the movie becomes a romance melodarma, not a horror movie. Their is no real suspense.I realize that compared to horror movies today, some the older movies might seem tame, but movies like frankenstien , the wolfman and their sequels haves their moments, but this one does not even have a mummy as we know it. Any body expecting to see a traditional monster will be disapointed. If I want to see a drama I will watch Citizen Kane.Finally, I like Karloff, he did some great horror B movies, this was not one of them."
5,Classic Horror in the Universal Tradition,"This imaginative 1932 chiller remains a Universal classic. Thanks to Karl Freund's atmospheric direction, ""The Mummy"" is a superior Egyptian-styled reworking of ""Dracula"" (1931). Boris Karloff delivers a masterful performance in the title role - enhanced by Jack Pierce's brilliant makeup. Unlike its numerous sequels and remakes, ""The Mummy"" endures as a subtle masterpiece of romantic horror."
4,Mummy - 1932 - Karloff,"Some of the reviews here suggest this version is not significantly better than the previous releases, which makes me think they may be confusing which version of this film they saw. The video portion of the film was improved slightly here, and it's reasonably clean, but not great. Where they did an astounding job here was with the audio - the previous release (in 2004?) had so much background noise it was like sitting over the engines on a jet plane that didn't have mufflers - really, really bad. This new version is very clean on sound, and the words are very clear and listenable. Overall, my viewing experience was excellent, and I highly recommend this version of the movie."
5,Karloff in a Romantic (!) Role -- As Moving as He is Creepy,"This is one of the most lyrical horror films ever made in this country, and much of its strength comes from the two romantic leads: Zita Johann, the smartest, sexiest and wittiest of all female leads in the great '30s horror pictures, and -- no, not poor David Manners, who's totally outclassed here -- but Boris Karloff, who proves that his beautiful, restrained voice and haunting eyes can convey love as eloquently as menace. Both performers have a powerful presence: they create a real electricity at their first glance and never allow it to dissipate. Karl Freund has wrapped this story in layers of dreamlike images, very appropriate for a tale about memories. In fact, perhaps the only images we see with razor-sharp clarity are those chilling closeups of Karloff's desiccated face. A masterpiece."
3,Boris Karloff Mummy,The movie is average. Theres not enough mummy scenes. You only see the mummy for like 4 minutes of the film.
3,MIXED REVIEW FOR PIERRE BENSUSAN 2,"Pierre Bensusan is one of the best fingerstyle guitarists in the world -- pariticularly his celtic repertoire. If you're look for an album containing performances of Bensusan's celtic fingerstyle guitar work, this album is not it. While there are a couple good tracks -- most notably track 5 ""The Pure Drop and the Flax in Bloom,"" the majority of the album is an eclectic mix of continental bagpipes, saxophones, piano, and lugubrious French vocals accompanied by Bensusan's admittedly good guitar backup. While nothing is bad about the album per se, if you're looking for celtic fingerstyle guitar, consider some of Bensusan's other albums."
5,One of the ELITE finger-stylists in the world.,"Pure perfection! It simply is, one of the greatest finger-style, guitar albums ever.You cant go wrong, and it cant be matched in chops, writing and passion.Bensusan, is considered one of the greatest guitarists in the world so you will get an earfull of great acoustic guitar picking....he also vocalizes over some tunes occassionally (80% instrumental 20% w/vocals), typically folksy lament in French or pure abstract scatisms....now imagine a Frenchman scatting over solo guitar with a celtic flavor, at the highest degree of beauty and technique.......Considered a leader in Celtic interpretations as well, playing exclusively in the DADGAD tuning......you have Bensusan."
5,Beautiful music to quiet all the frantic shopping hype!,"This is wonderful CD of guitar & English horn and oboe music is just about my favorite. It's one of my favorite gift-giving ideas, as well. It is so quieting and soothing to listen to after experiencing the mad crush that holiday shopping can be. We love it!"
5,"A fabulous , soothing recording - perfect for the Holidays","A wonderful, soothing piece of holiday music, perfect for unwinding after work or shopping, to wrap presents by. An excellent gift choice. I am so glad to find it on CD. I have owned the tape for many years and play it at least once a day during the season. Enjoy!!"
5,Fabulous acoustic offering of Christmas favorites,"I first heard this recording about six or seven years ago. Our family plays it regularly through the Christmas season (at least daily) and regularly gives it as gifts. Excellent guitar playing, plus flutes and other acoustic instruments. Highly recommended!"
5,About the joy of catch-and-release bass fishing,"That's a Keeper: Reflections on Life from a Bass Fisherman is H. Norman Wright's quiet and thoughtful memoir about the joy of catch-and-release bass fishing, as well as his spiritual reflections on Jesus Christ, who also used fishing and fishermen to weave his teachings about life and faith in God. That's A Keeper is highly recommended for Christian reading lists as a deeply contemplative, keenly insightful, thoughtful and thought-provoking testimony."
5,Beautiful,"I love piano music, and this is the ultimate. It's something that you can listen to not just at Christmastime. And ""Improvisation on a Theme adapted from Pachelbel's Canon in D Major"" is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. It's quite a long song and it just carries you away."
5,Best effort by both Lanz and Jones,"My favorite track is the 4th song, Improvisation on a Theme. Honestly, how many 12-minute long songs are out there that you can actually sit through without getting bored? This is one of them, although I seriously doubt that the song was actually improvised on a spot (it's too well conceived, structured, and crafted). It's a much better effort than Cristofori's Dream, the track that made David Lanz (and Narada label) famous initially. There are a lot of lame new-age CDs out there that tried to capitalize on its early success, but this is definitely not one of them."
5,Superb Music for the Soul & Mind,"This CD is just superb, especially the 3rd song, 'What Child is this ?'. Anyone would fall in love with Piano music after listening to these scores. Jones are especially good and deserves a major award on this. Only for tranquil people though, this is not pop music."
5,Great Travel Bible,"This is exactly the size I was looking for, which is important. I want to specify the size as I measured this Bible: Height 8.81, Width 5.75, Thickness 0.625 (all values in inches). This Bible is thin; font size is large enough to read easily, but not overly big. There are no cross references, but has notes at the bottom of the pages that deal with the source manuscripts. Large Concordance in the back and six pages of maps.If you intend to highlight various verses, I would recommend a dry highlighter so there wouldn't be any bleeding through the pages.It makes a great travel Bible, and I prefer the NKJV."
3,Don't like the texture of it.,This is a bonded leather bible and I have realized that the imitation leather fabric has a better feel and look.
5,A Must Have,"I saw the book on display in a Barnes and Noble I had to have it! I have been a boxing fan my whole life and I had never seen any of the photos of Ali that are diplayed in this book. The text is great, the photos are amazing, If you are a fan of the sweet science and a fan of the greatest boxer ever to lace a pair of gloves then you must have this book."
4,Cassius Clay A Rising Star,"LOVE Muhammad Ali - always have - didn't know alot about the young 19 year old Cassius Clay. The boy who becomes the man who is Muhammad Ali - This book tells some interesting stories about Cassius - I'm not sure why I'm suprised, or how I seperated the two in my mind...I mean...they are the same person...and you can see how Cassius is Muhammad - think to when you were 19 and imagine if your greatest qualities grew and become better etc -Anyway - the book is really good - not 5 star, but 4 - I would have liked MANY more pictures of Cassius and more stories too - I was left wanting more - which is normally a good thing - but here it felt somewhat incompleteDon't missunderstand - I would buy this again and buy it as gift for folks - if you don't have it - get it - it will make you smile"
5,"A Fitting Tribute to ""The Athlete of the Century""","This is a beautiful paean to a legendary athlete and hero. Flip Schulke's photos demonstrate the artistry of both the subject and the chronicler. There are unforgettable underwater images of the young fighter in training, as well as poignant candid shots that aptly demonstrate Ali's humanity. Matt Schudel's accompanying text manages the difficult job of enhancing these superb photos without being distracting or superfluous. The many anecdotes from associates of Ali, as well as the chronology of Ali's career, all serve to beautifully and literately complement the photographs. This is a gorgeous book, appropriate not just for boxing or sports fans, but for all fans of cultural history, photography, writing, and art. A beautifully executed work, and a fitting tribute to one of the century's greatest heros."
4,In the pursuit of qualitative research...,"this book provides clear, concrete examples of five ""traditions"" or types of qualitative research. If you need to understand the differences between biography, ethnography, grounded theory, case study, and other qualitative methods, this is the book for you. I've used it extensively in my dissertation writing."
3,my comments on the book,"I liked an anecdote the author commented at the beginning of the book, referring that a same problem could be treated since different methodologies of inquiry, it helped me.But he approaches qualitative inquiry from a single epistemological perspective, I had to use other authors to have a broader view."
2,HD vieo is very good but the music is cheesy.,I bought this to have the HD fireplace scenes along with Christmas music playing in the background when we had guests over for the holidays. The HD video was very nice but I was also expecting a quality arrangement of Christmas music to go with it. What we got was someone playing Christmas tunes on an electronic keyboard. It sounded cheap and cheesy. Fortunately we could turn off the music and just enjoy the fire. If you do not care about the music this is nice at a good price.
5,Very enjoyable,We enjoyed playing this DVD during Christmas Day while opening gifts and enjoying family time together. It was great to have this as background music during the day.
4,pleasantly surprised,"While browsing at the library, I came across this book on a display cart. Thumbed through and tried it. I Really enjoyed it. The character was so likable. I love the way Jennie fields writes. And being ""middle aged'' myself, I really related to many of the characters feelings. I am looking forward to trying her other novels."
3,Not bad,"Overall I liked this novel, and what it represents to women 'of a certain age' as the phrase goes. Second chances, trusting in yourself despite the odds and what experience has taught. Sometimes it ran a little sappy for my taste, though, especially in the e-mails between Jane and Jack. A quick but decent read."
4,DEEP KUNG FU FLICK,"I don't see why this film has been banned since 1983, but damn there was alot of victims at the hands of the assassin. The child's voice as the narritive was a good touch, it gave the movie a kind of serious tone. Shogun Assassin is just a portion of a series in the lone wolf and cub series, but the most bloody, so try to check out all Lone Wolf and Cub movies to get the full feel."
3,nice try,"This rating is soley based on the remastering, which was nicely done, accept that there are a couple scenes that are not restored at all (it actually says on the screen ""unrestored footage""). Personally I f***ing hated this. For what reason this was done, it was a bad choice. Of course this movie is awesome, but i recommend getting the whole Lone Wolf and Cub series. The only downfall for getting the series is you'll be missing the CLASSIC english dub (Gza's Liquid Swords)."
3,This is so so.,"Ok so here goes to put this simply they, have taken 2 movies and made one, as this is actually parts of the two ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" films. They cut and edited them to create another title so you are basically getting a condensed version. All in all it was still entertaining.. I would recommend that you by the original 2 films however."
3,English Dubbed...,"English dubbing any Asian film IMO is always a distraction, and in ""Shogun Assassin"" Wakayama Tomisaburo's commanding growl being incompatibly replaced detracts from his character's presence.Further, I agree with others that condensing the first two original episodes into one damages the original plot line and initial character development.This monumental classic IMO is best enjoyed as the original 6 episode ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" series also US released thru Animeigo which I would rate 5 stars for technical quality and accurate English translation subtitles.However, I do commend Animeigo for making this dubbed version available for those that prefer not to deal with translation subs."
5,Shogun Assassin,"FOLKS, THIS IS SWORDS PLAY AT IT'S BEST BY A MASTER SWORDSMAN. Tomisabur Wakayama was a true master samurai. His brother is famous for playing Zatoichi the Blind Swordsman. Shogun Assassin delivers on all levels and is considered by most to be one of the greatest displays of skills with a bladed weapon. This is not for the kiddies as blood spills everywhere and Tomisabur Wakayama takes no prisoners as Lone Wolf and Cub on the road to hell. This movie is a combination of scenes taken from the five or six films showcasing this superb samurai. If you are a action fan you will love this movie. One thing is guaranteed, you will definitely not be bored. Made is the 60's, the fight scenes has stood the test of time and can stand against anything made today. I have been a fan of Shogun Assassin for 35 years now. Excellent job on the blu-ray. Cheers."
5,shogun assassin,"if you like samurai mayhem.get it.this is a classic.even the extra with samuel l jackson stuff is very cool.i would like to see quentin tarantino redo this,or was that kill bill"
4,Cult Classic,"Every time I see this movie I am so taking back to the Grindhouse era. Sonny Chiba, The Street Fighter Series is another personal favorite, along with Battle Royale."
4,Hmmmm,"Interesting to see where Quentin pulls some of his crazy stuff from. This has to be the earliest example of ""blood geysers"" that I have seen. There are probably earlier examples, but I'm not an aficionado on the samurai movies."
4,great bluray set,This was a great buy for the price loved the movies the frost one is on the first disk with cool extra like commentary from samual jakson then the other 4 movies are on the second disk they all look great in bluray it all most like watching it for the frost time again the first one defenatly had the most work done to it only reason I dident give it 5 stars felt the other 4 moves were just cramed togather on the second disk the menu and extras were not as good on the second disk but all and all worth the buy and is a awesome watch
5,It Helped A Lot.,"I almost hate to review this book because it will publicly link my name with smoking. It is worth it, though, because this review may help someone else to ditch cigarettes. I thought I needed all the help I could get to stop smoking. I liked the approach this author has and I still refer to this book. It has a no nonsense approach that appealed to me and works well into the process of stopping smoking. I recommend this book to anyone who is considering breaking their smoking habit."
5,Constant use,"Have used this to help friend quit smoking. Great suggestions, uses clear language. Does suggest starting in the middle of the book if you are resistant to change...which confused me at first. Overall great book. Exercises can be used for other addictions too"
4,"Only Charles Bronson, only Charles Bronson...","Same Paul Kersey storyline, but like I said, nobody pulls it of like old Charles Bronson. The plot does get interesting in this one though. The actors portraying the gangsters did a great job. Charles Bronson role is as always-- legendary in its own way. It was fun watching Paul Kersey (Bronson) systematically hunt down the bad guys. Let's just say I was so into the story, at the last climatic grenade launch, I found myself cheering like the Vikings just won the superbowl. As fan of mafia movies like those of Al Pacino's ---sobbing, ""They just whacked Jimmy!""--- I think Death Wish 4 is a four star."
3,For fans of the series only.....,"In truth, there is little to recommend in this film outside of a few moments of guilty pleasure. Non-fans will likely be offended, but true Bronson die-hards will appreciate the cheap production values, bad acting, cliched script, and laughable plot ""twists."" Surprisingly enough, the lack of any real drama is the film's true selling point because it gives fans a chance to observe how truly empty the series really is. Still, I laughed uproariously at multiple scenes and in all, the film is endlessly quotable. Hardly a worthy follow-up to the sheer brilliance of part three, but a worthy rental for unintentional hilarity."
5,The target - Crack dealers,"Death Wish 4 DVDThe main 'problem' with Death Wish 4 is that there's a bit of a plot and that makes it a little different from the last 3 Death Wishes, but heck it's still a good time!! Having killed all muggers and rapists, Kersey's now killing mobsters connected to crack! He just keeps working his way up the food chain! There's a plot twist in this one too! Does it get any better than the Death Wish series? NO WAY! Nobody wreaks vengeance like Bronson! Wait until you see Death Wish 5!Recommended for Charles Bronson fans, and fans of the Death Wish movies.Gunner January 2008"
5,Classic tough guy action from the 80's,"In this movie the Death Wish series goes back to its roots from Death Wish 2 where Bronson is hiding his vigilante activity from his girl friend. This movie features some very familiar faces in the supporting cast from other 80's and 90's movies with explosions. The movie felt like the story did a better job of making Bronson's character more emotionally well rounded unlike Death Wish 3 where his female lawyer just magically asked him out on a date after he gets released from police custody. So, if you love Charles Bronson and want to complete your collection of his action movies, then this it a must buy."
5,I almost understand Gödel,"This book was an almost perfect introduction the incompleteness theorems. The major concepts are explained extremely clearly without getting the reader lost in the complexities. After reading this, I think I have a solid understanding of what Gödel actually showed, and I feel I could jump into more technical texts with solid footing."
1,Only for a novice,"I read Godel's original paper over my winter break (2001) from my second year of medical school at UCSF. It is a fun paper to try to grasp, but unless you are extremely mathematically gifted (like me) or have spent years plodding away studying philosophy or math, then stay away from the original paper. If you are a casual reader and want to read great and important philosophy then stick with Heidigger and Kierkegard and such. Being and Time is a lot more fun if you just want some easy reading. Godel is hard stuff and only accessible to a select few. I loved it.However, if you are new to logic, mathematics or philosophy then you can try to read Nagel's book. I found it too simplistic and way too remedial. If that is your style then buy Nagel. However, if you are more sophisticated like me, then go read the original work. You will be much better off for it."
5,Good for logic fans,Helps those without pure math background (or even those with such a background) gain an understanding of the important fundamental ideas embodied in Gödel's work. Clearly written and understandable for any reasonably bright individual.
1,He Dumbs It Down Way Too Much,"As the reviewer below, I too am a medical student/mathematican. I consider myself the foremost amature number theorist since Fermat and can read and translate ANY mathematical or philosophical document.Godel's proof is perhaps the most important document since the Declaration of Independence. It is a shame that Nagel treats it so lightly and debases it by trying to make it comprehensible to the common man. Only elite intellectuals like me are able to truly appreciate this document.If you would be into the Reader's Digest version of Being and Time, then read this book, but if you are up to the challenge, pick up the real thing. Be forewarned it will only be comprehensible to logicians and gifted medical students like me."
5,Possibly the briefest and clearest exposition available.,"This is an excellent book. No nonsense, no cute metaphors (except one involving supermarkets. But one is excusable!) Douglas Hofstadter's ""Gödel, Escher, Bach"", though entertaining, tended to rely on obscure (and interminable) form-content interplay to illustrate its points. ""Gödel's Proof"" sticks to the facts and gets you there in a few hours."
2,A sex book and little else,"Okay, I thought this was going to be pretty artwork (books like that exist - though rarely - like Manara's Gullivera). Instead, it's a pretty hum-drum sex book using too many close ups and unimaginatively drawn characters (who are techincally drawn okay but look dull) and quiet gross ""flying fluids"" exageration. The stories are the same-ole repressed male fantasy stories you can hear anywhere - although not as original (forbidden fruit gets stale) as some grass-roots stories. Boring. If not stupid. Erotic only to the lame. I own quiet a bit of plain-jane non-erotic mainstream manga and I can only say that there are far better artists with talent both in drawing and layout out there. Indeed, even as far as sex matters go, tamer series get it better. In hopes of swaying, swinging breasted ladies flirting and laughing, I was disappointed in basically raw pornography."
2,Boring,"Since the other reviews were so positive, I thought it might be nice to have another perspective. I didn't hate this book, but frankly, I really didn't like it, either. In a word, it was boring. The couple was already together and the major conflict was that the characters had major communication problems. The reason I bought the book was because the amnesia part of the book sounded interesting (not that I haven't seen that plot device before), but it didn't actually happen until about half-way through. Honestly, the plot just wasn't that original, and the characters weren't loveable enough to save it. In fact, the female character was a bit of a door mat and that never changed."
5,An Unforgettable Experience-What a Film!,When I first heard about this film I thought it sounded interesting. I was totally unprepared for how strong an impact this film would have on me. It is amazing. Anyone who enjoys theatre at any level will have an unforgettable experience watching this film. It is obvious how much love Rick McKay has for his subject. The interviews are personal and filled with emotion. This DVD is one I will watch again and again. I learned so much about stars with whom I was not previously familiar. I loved hearing about the star Laurette Taylor. She had such an impact on many better known Broadway legends. Footage of Laurette Taylor and Kim Stanley is unbelievable. I understand why they both are revered by so many actors. Threecheers to Rick McKay for preserving such an important part of our history.
5,"A Truly American, Inspirational Story!","I love this movie. I have seen it twice and can't wait for the DVD (but I wish it was offered on VHS, too!) to see it again!What I really appreciated was that it is not just a story of Broadway, but a story of passion and struggle and persevrance. Everybody talks about how it is the largest cast of stars ever in one movie, but what it is most touching is that much of the movie is about before they were stars. How Carol Burnett and her room-mates shared a dress, how Robert Goulet stole silverware, how Angela Lansbury fought for the job in ""Mame"" and how Shirley MacLaine got her big break as the understudy in ""Pajama Game."" It made me believe that anything was - and IS - possible if you are passionate. I saw that someone wrote that it reminds you not to quit ""five minutes before your miracle."" Well, that's what this movie is - a miracle. And it is the ultimate ""feel good movie"" and when in history have we ever needed a movie like this more?"
3,Not exactly what I expected,"I was hoping this was a compilation of commentary and performances. Instead, it was mostly a commentary by various stars with very few snippets of performances.It's a great nostalgia piece for historical purposes, but not what I'd call entertainment. So, if nostalgia is your intention, this is a great buy, but don't expect performances."
3,"I like it, but","I learned after I bought this that it is tested on animals, which I dislike greatly, so unfortunately I won't be buying it again."
2,overpriced,"Totally overpriced product, and do not understand what the hype is all about, even went to the local Sephora store , tried different shades and it seemed to have mad no difference of creating a radiant touch , or luminous glow to my face .Really tried to like this product since many gave it great reviews, but also for the very high price I can do without."
1,not what i expected,i don't like the way this product is dispensed. i push the cap several times and wait...nothing...then again and it gushes out--wasteful. will not use this product again.
5,"Touche Eclat, Just That!",Simply the best concealer available. Brushes on for an almost invisible light-diffusing effect to obscure flaws; both wrinkles and discolorations.
5,Radiant Touch Highlighter (Yves St Laurent),"Very nice product. Not just for dark circles under eyes coverage. I have used this product for many years, have tried others and still come back to this one. Nothing seems to do the job as well. Covers up and highlights, too."
2,good product container not so much..,"The concealer is good..looks nice, works well..however getting the top off it and reclosing it is a huge pain..hands already slippery, it's all but impossible to get the top off it..then you click the opposite end to release the product..then when you put the top back on, you must be very careful so as not to release more product when you try to snap the top back on..I like the concealer..but won't buy again because of the container."
2,disappointed,Not sure what the point of the product is. I used an Amazon coupon for the purchase so I am not out much but it seems to do nothing.
1,Price EXTREMELY Inflated,"This is a GREAT product (I've used it pretty much everyday for the last 8 years and it really diminishes the dark circles under my eyes), BUT this product generally retails for $40 at Nordstrom and Sephora. At a $100, it's highway robbery at a 250% markup. I know I will never be buying anything from BatheandBeauty unless I asked to be mugged on purpose."
2,Okay,Not great for the price point - likes to get stuck in the fine lines around the eyes - just what we don't want.
3,No different,I do not notice any difference between this (expensive) and a normal over the counter luminous highlighter. I do not think I will purchase again.
3,"For the price, it's alright","I just got Revlon Photoready and, frankly, for the money, i prefer the Photoready. This is almost the equivalent of Garnier (that roller ball thing for undereye circles) in terms of coverage. It has a bit more of a pinkish color to it. I wouldn't pay full price for it. I'm also not a fan of the little brush. Ick. Germs."
5,Perfect Solution,"I've always had a problem with dark under-eye circles. After hearing many raves for this product, I decided to try it for myself. YSL's Radiant Touch is the best- you get what you pay for. The tube might look small, but so far I have had mine for 4 months, using daily. It gives nice sheer coverage which you can build up, without looking cakey. I love the way it brightens the entire eye area- it gives my eyes a little pop. The brush-tip is perfect for getting into the corners of eyes. I tap the area down a bit with the pad of my finger to blend. Works wonderfully, will definitley buy again."
1,Touche e'clat,"I've always been a fan. However, this missed the mark. It arrived quickly and looked like it has in the past. However, upon application it was a very very dry consistency. Perhaps it had been on the shelf for a long time, hence the lower price??? probably won't try it again."
1,defective product,"I have used other Yves St, Laurent Touche Eclat products, but thought I'd try the peach. I am very disappointed. The color itself was very harsh, and after the second attempt to push the button to get the product released into the brush, it quit working entirely. I assume the product was old, but under any circumstances it was defective. From now on I'm buying this product in a store where I can return it."
1,Fake,"Don't bother with this, as it is not the real product. It is not the right texture or color, Go to Nordstrom and pay the $40 to get the real thing, or go to a drugstore to get a cheaper product, as you will at least have the ingredients listed."
2,Product Doesn't Seem Right,I am a die-hard Touche Eclat fan. It is an absolute must-have for me and I've bought a number of these over the years. Was SO psyched to find it at this reduced price vs. the normal $40+. The shipping of the product was fine -- fairly standard. But the product itself seems off -- almost like it's old. It feels more like a product at the end of its lifecycle instead of a brand new one. Bummed. Won't buy from this seller again.
3,it was ok,"i purchased due to reviews on makeup alley.com but did not think is worth the money. Great color and packaging, that is it. Currently using Lancome waterproof concealer tube and that last all day- even after my lunch workout. I would not buy again."
5,Love it!,This highlighter is excellent. I use it to hide the dark circles under my eyes. These dark circles are hereditary so I can't prevent them but I can cover them up. I used a lighter color first but have switched to a darker color now.
4,Give it a chance!,"We originally bought this toy 5 months ago along with the pirate ship for our [young kind]. But like what everyone else is saying, it seemed tedious putting it together and after 10 minutes of play my son needed me to put it back together again. I almost super glued the thing together but instead packed it away to bring out in a year or two.But a month ago my son convinced me to get it all out again and let him play. This time I didn't follow directions and it only took me 2 minutes to construct a castle of my creation. This got me thinking about the entire idea of the toy. It's meant to be put together and taken apart numerous times, even in one play hour.If you keep this in mind, throw away the directions, and remember that to a [young kind] destruction and rebuilding is half the fun, then your child and YOU will enjoy the toy!"
4,Why did they discontine the Great Adventure toys?,"I am so disappointed in Fisher-Price. I bought most of the imaginext toys at Christmas. My 4 yr. old loves to play with them, but they are always falling apart. He has no interest in trying to put them back together, so I have to do it. And everytime I put them back together it takes a considerable amount of time and I have to pull out the original instructions. I finally had it and decided to glue them all together ( a task which took many hours). He csn now play with them fine, but I won't be buying any of the newer Imaginext line. In fact, I am searching Ebay to purchase the older Fisher-Price Great Adventures toys!!"
2,Do not buy this toy!,"If I could go back and return unopened the imaginext sets my sons recieved for Christmas, I would do it in a heartbeat! This is the most frustrating toy we've purchased in quite some time. It is extremely complicated for an adult to put together much less a child (mine are 5 and 3). And once we did get it put together in some form, if you moved it the wrong way, it would completely fall apart. They became so frustrated! Bottom line, it was all my children wanted for Christmas and now it is in a pile of dismanteled pieces (MANY pieces) and will probably never be played with again. Do not buy this toy!"
2,Return or Exchange it.,"The Battle Castle was only one of many Imaginex playsets my 4 year old son received for Christmas. The castle has proven to be impossible for him to play with. It falls apart with the slightest movement, and it is so hard to put back together. However he really likes the firestation and it much more durable. He can actually play with it a while before it comes apart. He has the older version of the FP castle and he has resorted to using the new knights with the older castle. So it hasnt been a total loss. If you have bought this and havent yet opened it return it... ASAP We only wish we could."
3,Great toy but does not stay together!,"My 6 year old son got several of the Imaginext castle sets for Christmas and he loves them. He really enjoys playing with them however, the castle WILL NOT stay together! We put it together just like the directions. We thought that would be better to begin with. He takes apart the smaller sets such as the wizard's tower and rebuilds these but he wants the castle to stay the way it looks in the picture. However, everytime its bumped or moved, it falls apart. How annoying!! I am constantly reassembling it (or trying to!). I love the concept of the kids building their own version but I would much rather have the old version of the Fisher Price Castle!"
4,Not easy for younger kids,"This was a Christmas present for my 5-1/2 year old, who is ordinarily very adept at construction-type toys. He required a good deal of assistance with this one, however. Unlike Legos, the walls and floors need to be placed in the correct sequence. Once we got the hang of it, the castle has been one of this year's favorites."
2,Not Happy,This castle takes about 1/2 hour to set up and can be accidently knocked down in about 1 second by barely playing with it. You spend another 10 minutes fixing whatever section came apart and it happens all over again. It is hard to play with this castle without it coming apart. Boys are rough and this toy definately cant stand any rough play. I would not recommend this toy!
2,big disappointment,"Bought this toy for my 4 year old because it sounded like a lot of fun, a castle and building toy. But building it is a long task and too difficult for a child! Once built it falls apart durring even the most gentle play ( and as a battle castle is not condusive to gentle play). This leaves my son very frustrated. It is frustrating to me as well because i thought it would end up a favorite but spends most of the time in a drawer!"
5,battle castle,My son loved this toy. It was very durable once snapped together and he played with it for hours!!!!!
2,I expected better from Fisher Price,"For all of you thinking that there is a chance that this toy will be sturdier than what previous reviews state---THINK AGAIN!!My son got this item last Christmas along w/the Dungeon and other pieces. I had read the reviews prior to purchase and thought to myself "" Well, it can't be that bad."" Well, it is that bad and to put it bluntly this toy is sitting partially assembled w/a majority of the pieces in a nearbyRubbermaid box. Once assembled, my 5 yr old loves it, but the only problem is that once he shoots a few cannons or does some other type of battle, the castle crumbles (and this is after we have spent extensive time setting it up in the first place)! Purchase this item ONLY if you don't mind constantly assembling it."
1,Falls Apart Constantly,"This item is horrible. It falls apart constantly. We tried hot gluing and superglue, however, NOTHING works. Even our 4-1/2 YR son has told us to throw this out he is so frustrated. The tower on this item is so high it continuously falls off.Part of appeal was you can take Imaginext items & reconfigure them, great concept. However, no matter how you configure them, they ALL fall apart.During assembly notice they do not ""click"" as you would expect. Pieces never lock together, even with the bottom ""base"" pieces.We resorted to putting all the Imaginext on a table for him to play, however, flat surface, bumpy surface, any surface, it falls apart.(...)When a 4-1/2 YR wants you to throw out his toys, somethings wrong!"
3,Won't stay Together!,"My 4 year old was SO excited to get this for Christmas. It took a long time to put together because you have to press really hard to snap the pieces together but when you do, another section falls apart from pressing against it. Once you finally get it together, pieces start falling off whenever it is touched or you try to move something. I gave it 3 stars for fun because if you put it on a table it stays together enough that they can play with it some and have fun with it. If you put it together on the carpet (where we typically use it), it won't stay together."
3,"Fun, but falls apart.","We bought this castle for our three year old son for Christmas. It took me about 10-15 minutes to put the whole thing together...the instructions were very easy to understand and follow. It was a good thing, too, because you end up putting this toy together more times than you can ever imagine! My son played with the toy for roughly FIVE MINUTES and the walls starting coming apart. Keep in mind that my son wasn't tearing it apart...the walls just start falling off of the thing.Jake (my little boy) loves all of the accessories that come with the castle. It has a bed, a catapult, bows and arrows, etc.Unfortunately, the castle hasn't kept his interest because he can't play with it without it coming apart. I wouldn't recommedn this toy for anyone unless you intend to glue it together...then it would be great!"
2,VERY disappointed and frustrated,"We purchased this Castle instead of the Playmobil model because it looked like alot of fun. Intended to be 'built', we thought it would encourage our son to use his imagination and be creative. Unfortunately, as soon as we snapped the pieces together, it fell apart before my son had a chance to enjoy it. It is a constant struggle to keep it 'together' and even with the slightest bump, it comes apart and causes frustration. He has totally lost interest because it doesn't stay together long enough for him to become involved in the whole adventure that is supposed to be inspired by such a toy. It has many neat features, and had it stayed together better, I would have given it 5 stars. I wish I had spent the extra money and bought the Playmobil, obviously the better choice."
3,im not sure,I am not sure about this toy. I suppose if you want a toy for a child to play with so you can have a little break during the day. This would not be the toy. I am constantly putting it back together. I love working with my son on projects but this one is frusterating for the both of us. He and my 2 year old think its really cool and if we ever get it working properly it acually might be.
3,Endless Rebuilt for parents,I got this for my son last Christmas. It took about 2 hours to put together and about 2 minutes for him to rip apart. So I thought I would Krazy Glue it together. It did not work. I sold it at a garage sale for $10. Not worth the time to locate small pieces and rebuilt every night.
5,The Power of Diana Wynn Jones,"One of the best writers ever, hands down, is Diana Wynn Jones. She must have the most amazing imagination, she comes up with so many new and fresh ideas and her characters are real people. The Power of Three is one of her best books, the premise is marvelous and there is a twist where you suddenly see yourself as seen by the characers and you are rocked. It is also great fun to read, you will finish it and start at the beginning again."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A pretty good kids book. The three children of a clan leader have psionic powers, or, at least, all come to discover that they do.They also have to deal with the feuds between their clans and others, as well as with the different non-human races that inhabit the same area."
2,Side Effects,"In the literature it always states that it is extremely rare for people to experience side effects. However, I do NOT think this is the case if you are very sensitive to medications. If you are, you will want to take a much lower dose of this potent herb. The recommended dose threw me into a detox that was utterly miserable and lasted for weeks. It took me a while to put two and two together as I just thought I was sick. The same day I stopped taking this product, my symptoms went away."
2,I expected so much more...,"after really enjoying the first three books in this series, I expected more than this terribly insipid work. It seemed rushed, poorly thought out and I was extremely disappointed."
3,Professional dancers might be able to follow.,"Holy Cow! I felt like a cow trying to follow. If you can do the aerobic section of this tape you are a better person than me. Watched it several times, tried it a few and got so frustrated that I gave up. On the other hand, or foot, the stretching is very good and probably worth the price of the tape. I suggest you borrow a copy before you buy if possible."
1,very disappointing,"I bought this video because I enjoyed the other aerobic tape in Jane Fonda's personal trainer series: the abs, buns and thighs tape. I was very disappointed to find that the aerobic section was almost impossible to follow, full of fast footwork and uninteresting moves. I guess in time I could pick up the steps, but they didn't seem much fun anyway and I won't bother. I would not recommend this tape to anyone."
2,"Aerobics section AWFUL, Stretching is Pretty Good","I really hate the aerobics section of this tape. As several other reviews say, the moves are too complicated. I spend more energy getting frustrated that I'm not able to follow the moves, and I start to make up my own moves, and what's the point of following a video if you can't actually follow it. I've sworn I will never do this routine again.I do enjoy the stretching program. It can be very soothing and relaxing - and you really feel FANTASTIC when you're done. I just wish I could make more time in my schedule to do it more often. I use the other two tapes in this series and LOVE 'EM!"
5,"Quick, fun, great for beginners.","I like to do this in combination with one of the Total Body Sculpting workouts (one of the tapes in this series). It's a fun dance-based routine that I look forward to doing. The stretch routine is good, too, but not quite as good as the one in her Stress Reduction workout."
4,pretty good but too short,"I like this video well enough but don't quite understand why it's gotten such perfect rave reviews. The aerobic portion is only 20 minutes long and often the counting is off the beat and out of rhythm. I do like Grogan's engaging style but a few too many times the cueing is messed up and the people are out of sync. It's a very good workout to do when one is short of time or to do in conjunction with another video to get a good workout, but many of the other videos I've seen, including Tae-bo, are more professionally done and offer a more complete workout."
1,No Rhythm and No Organization - The WORST,"This has to be the worst tape I've purchased and I have at least 300 videos in my library. I would consider myself a cardio boxing enthusiast. I have been doing Taebo for 3 years and LOVE it. I wanted to expand my library since I have every Taebo Advanced tape available. I received Rich Grogan's tape and tried it over the weekend. Not only does he have no rhythm, his crew is out of synch, the music is not in tempo with the moves and the quality of the tape is horrible. Everyone is moving at different times because the beat of the music doesn't match the workout moves. Grogan is a mess in this tape. Either he can't keep up with his crew or the crew can't keep up with him. It looks like he filmed it himself with a camcorder. Save your money. I found it hard to keep my heart rate up at a steady rate. (...)"
5,I really enjoyed this video,"I really enjoyed the kick to get fit workout. I found the video to be very enjoyable and very easy to follow along with. The instructor, Rich Grogan, shows you different levels for doing the movements, this has been very helpful, and is one of the reasons why I find this video fun to do. Another reason is the movements are very controlled and are done at a lot slower pace than most videos I've seen. I have found that by doing the movements slower and more controlled, my muscles seem to burn more. It makes me wonder why other videos go so fast! If you're looking for a really fun workout that is easy to do, I recommend kick to get fit."
5,A MUST SEE for any RUSH FAN,"This is such an AMAZING movie. It was only release in limited areas and for a limited time period. I bought it for my husband who is a MAJOR RUSH fan since he was little. The movie was AWESOME. I enjoyed watching it as much as he did. You get to see interviews with all 3 members, how their music is created and things they went through throughout their careers. I would definitely recommend this movie!!!"
5,Excellent doc on Rush......,"Ever since I picked up 2112 in 1976 at a Kerr Drug store in Cary NC at the tender age of 14 I've been mesmerized with this band. I've always wondered back then through A Farewell to Kings, Hemispheres, etc. who these guys really were and from 'Canada'? I use to sit night after night listening to their albums throughout middle school and high school. I did lose some interest in the 'keyboard' years as I believe others had, but in 1989 while in Grad school I picked up Presto and it was like meeting old friends again. This movie showed me things I never knew about these guys. I thought it was great to see their parents in the movie. It really brings home the fact these 3 guys are really just regular guys who wanted to play music. I was the same way many years ago, but never pursued it, but at least I could live it through Geddy, Alex and Neil. Been waiting for a documentary on this band and this hits a home run."
5,Required for fans of RUSH,"I am one of those fans that has had the RUSH albums, CDs and then the RUSH remasters. They were the first band I went to see live ($6.00 back in the day) I love DVD sets with rare concert footage, and the little tidbits into the past. It's kind of like reliving my childhood as well. Normally I wouldn't buy a full on documentary, but if you are a RUSH fan like me this set is a must have. I couldn't stop watching it, twice in 2 days. This one's a keeper. There is something in this set for all fans of RUSH, even if you aren't a rabid fan like me. I highly recommend this set."
5,A must have for Rush Fans,The must have for any Rush fan. A great way to learn about how Rush became Rush
5,Best Rockumentry I have ever seen!!!,Rush has always been a very private band. This documentary really chronicled their career as a band and gave lots of insight to their roots. The interviews from other bands showed how well they are appreciated amongst their peers. I have a greater appreciation for Rush thanks to this. A must have for any Rush fan.
4,Rush documentary is very interesting,"If you are a Rush fan this is a must have DVD. It has an amazing amount of history about the individuals that make up one of the greatest rock bands of all time. From humble beginnings, to overwork, juggling raising families while touring, and tragedy that almost broke up the band for ever. Then the resurrection of the band that has exceeded their own expectations.Great video of the early days of the band, and never before video of the band live."
5,"THE ""RUSH"" STORY WE NEVER KNEW","What a great job they did on this film. It takes you back from Alex Lifeson's and Geddy Lee's high school days and the evolution of the band to where they met and hired Neal Peart, the best drummer of my generation.Neal is literally a brainiac. A symphonic orchestra should have him narrate and play the drum parts of Peter And The Wolf By Prokofiev.I had no idea that the band took a long break because of Neal's wife and daughters death.So I don't spoil this, this is a very well done documentary by one of the most important bands in Rock History.Some of the extras take the bakery for me...like when they are eating dinner, getting hammered drinking wine and laughing like there's no tomorrow!!!RAY ST JOHN"
5,One word... AWESOME!!!,Perfect video for the ultimate Rush fan! Very cool old home video of Alex and videos with John Rutsey playing live. Love this band? You will LOVE this video!!!
4,Rush Beyond The Lighted Stage Blu-ray,After watching this show on VH1 I thought it would be good for my collection. My order came faster than expected. It came in perfect condition.
5,Pinch me I'm dreaming,"The absolute most perfect movie ever made and everything deserving such a flawless band. If you like even just one RUSH song you will love this movie and more of their music. If you are a diehard fan and can find any fault with this movie, I will eat my hat. Which, luckily is made of chocolate. But still, I don't want to eat it, it keeps my head warm. GET THIS MOVIE DARN IT!"
5,Beyond the Lighted Stage-Rush...Awesome!,"Great video! A nice behind the scenes look throughout Rush's career from the early beginnings to today. Answered a few questions I always had such as ""Why did John Rutsey leave the band?"", etc...A lot of great looking footage and some interesting, older footage. Includes a bonus disc with extra film and concert footage. A highly recommended video for any Rush fan."
5,Endless supply of Rocket Fuel!,The most amazing respected career of any band in history is finally documented.Thank you guys for allowing this to be produced.We are so lucky to have these guys still kickin' after all these years.Immortal!
5,Awesome DVD over & over again,"Like the title states, this is an awesome, awesome DVD of RUSH. My beloved wife bought it for me for Christmas and we have watched it more than once since Christmas"
5,It approaches the unreal,"I've been a huge Rush fan since the late Seventies, and this documentary put a huge smile on my face. It's a delight for hardcore fans like myself, but it's very engaging and entertaining even for those who only know ""Tom Sawyer"" and the other songs played on classic rock radio."
4,A great gift for a Rush fanatic,"If you love Rush, you will love this. But someone please answer me this: why does Jack Black have to yuck it up and ruin parts of this for me? Even my wife thought he was childish. Everyone else (the stars that were interviewed) were all very professional and humbled. Not Jack Black. He needs to stick to making kids movies."
5,A stellar production!,"There isn't too much I can add to what's already been said so well here.If you're a rock music fan that wants to watch a fascinating and very well-made documentary about a classic band who didn't implode, end up hating each other, succumb to substance abuse, or stop writing good material back in 1978, this is a great film.If you like Rush at all (and maybe still have that copy of Moving Pictures somewhere in your collection), you must see this.If you're a true fan, you must own this!The archival concert footage, and the interviews with Geddy, Alex, and Neil (and their parents!) are my favorite sections. One of the best music documentaries I've seen in a long time, one that will be well worth repeat viewings."
5,Saw it on VH1,"Watched the cut on VH1 this weekend and fell in love all over again! I can't wait to get my long awaited pre-order next week.And as for the stereotypical Rush fan..... There is no such thing. We are from every corner of the galaxy. I am woman, hear me ROCK!!!!"
3,Why did I get a BlueRay Player?,It looks like if you get the BluerayRush: Beyond the Lighted Stage [Blu-ray]you only get the movie and not the extra bonus disc. Why did I replace my DVD player with a Blueray player If I'm not going to get the extra stuff????????
5,2 Discs of Special Features,"I'm only giving this a 3 for now because I opened the package and instead of seeing the feature documentary, I see two identical discs. It seems this package has only 2 of the same special features DVD. Will have to return this and wait yet another week to see this film. I'm sure it will be great and I've been a RUSH fan since I was 8. My very first concert, ever, was Moving Pictures. I wonder if this is some sort of collector's item now?I'll post again once I get a corrected set.I did get the corrected set a week later. Great DVD! Loved it!"
4,"yes, this album is awesome","Since I can't write a better review than what's already been written, I'll just say that I agree with what everyone else has said so far. Besides ""Couldn't You Tell"", other standout tracks are ""Blood and Peanut Butter"", ""Parapaleejo"", ""Richard Dawson""...yeah, a lot of em. Pop! Timeless! Catchy! Sweet! Weird lyrics! Not annoying!I wanted to add that if you can see him live, DO IT. He's a great performer and funny as well. The one time I've been able to see him so far, he sang beautifully and was in good spirits despite being sick."
5,Great Brian Wilson influenced pop gem!,"Thank you, other Amazon reviewers-based on your well written (and accurate) reviews, I bought this and I am really glad I did! As another reviewer noted, the first tune, ""Couldn't You Tell"" is a fantastic pop song, I listen to it every day. These guys remind of the excellent group Tan Sleeve. Some Wondermints and Beach Boys reference also. The song ""Emily's Dead to Me"" is kind of like ""Stacy's Mom"" by FOW, great sick lyrics and wonderful melody. This is a keeper. And if you like melodic pop, don't miss out on Bill Ricchini's new ""Tonight I Burn"" which also features Brian Christinzio (b.c. Camplight)."
2,That one song is good...,"Sometimes you buy an album for That One Song and hope to that That Song and a few others that are as good as That Song. Sometimes you only get That Song. I only got That Song. Not bad music, just not represented as a whole well by That One Song. If more of the songs were uptempo I'd probably listen to this album and not rest cold drinks on it."
4,Chicken Soup for the Spiritually Hungry,"Althought the layout takes getting used to, by the 4th or 5th page one can get thoroughly absorbed in the text and the words of wisdom.Nizamuddin Awliya was a great Muslim Saint of the Chishti spiritual order during the Moghul-Indian era. He was a spiritual inheritor of Baba Fariduddin Ganj Shakr and of Khwaja Muinuddin Chisti of Ajmer. Among his famous disciples was Amir Khusroe, the famous sufi poet.While this is a collection of his sayings to his students and people of the era, much of the advice is timeless.Bruce lawrence has made a good effort in keeping the mood of the text and this is a book not only for those interested in Sufism, but as a book of inspiration and comfort ."
5,Revealing the HolyLand DVD review,"This is an amazing video. I had actually seen this video after traveling to Holy Land and it captured the best of the best of what we saw plus many things we didn't. I rarely will buy DVDs and almost never watch something twice, so it is a true compliment to this director that I felt compelled to purchase it."
3,Good DVD,"I was extremely disappointed that the information that usually comes with a DVD of this categorywas not included. If I had known that, I would have bought it from another source. I feel this absenceshould be listed in the information given about the DVD. Perhaps others wouldn't have cared - I did !"
1,A Snowboarding Gamer,This is probably the worst snowboarding game I have ever played.The graphics aren't that good and the tricks that you do aren't near as good as 1080.I'd recommend that over this one in a heartbeat.
1,i hated it beyond all reason,"it is so impossably hard to beat the stunt challenges and exeptionally hard to beat races. maybe im wrong, but you cant do any special moves. overall, it is [poor]"
4,Mastery Through Accomplishment,"What can be said about Django that has not already been said? He is unique, no one even comes close. The Rosenberg Trio is about the only other group that even sounds somewhat the same and they don't have Stephan Grapelli. There is a kind of vibrato at the end of many of Django's notes that is totally unique. And he bends the strings with such perfection. Wish he were recording on current technology. Some of the cuts sound good while other show their age, but throughout Django and Stephan are fantastic."
4,solid and entertaining aimed at the genre generalist,"The twenty contributions that make up this collection for the most part live up to the title as each tale occurs on a hot and sultry night. The stories run the gamut of crime fiction with a few seemingly more thriller than mystery. The contributors make up some of the top talent in the genre. It is this not surprising that all the tales is solid and entertaining though a few are superb. A HOT AND SULTRY NIGHT is aimed at the genre generalist as it crosses a diverse series of lines. Anyone who prefers a particular sub-genre will most likely find at least a story or two in the anthology, but must decide the economic value.Harriet Klausner"
4,Other Books,"Let us see, when you have a group of proven escape artists, and you don't want them escaping any more, what do you do?Oh, you send them all to the one supposedly secure facility so they can all combine their talents and come up with even more impressive methods and escapes.Pretty much that is a lot of what happened at Colditz, it seems. An excellent look at the ingenuity of some prisoners of the Germans."
3,Not too bad,"This book was well written, but the language was extremely sophisticated. The author wrote the novel in how ,now days,we thought the residents of the Medival Times talked. The overall story wasn't too bad, but not as good as I thought it would be. Although the novel was difficult to read, from what you could make out was truly brought to life. You could tell that Howard Pyle truly has a love for writting; reflected from the content in the novel. This novel would be for anyone with an adventerous soul. This novel truly helped my understanding of the Medival history."
1,Not as advertised,"My son is very disappointed because the illustrations on the ""Look Inside"" feature are nowhere to be found. It is possible that this may be the best story ever written but please deliver what is advertised. Have a fabulous day.I called Amazon and some lady with a thick foreign accent answered. She was very nice and had a good handle on the language. She assured me that she would send a copy that matched the description on the website. Unfortunately I received the same book. There are no illustrations in this book. This is a bad experience with this book but I still love Amazon."
2,Not the best telling,"I read three versions of the Arthurian legends recently, and this one was the weakest. The language is somewhere between Malory's archaic form and modern prose, but does not succeed well at being either. The tales were also, in my opinion, less well told than in the others.For your consideration, I read La Morte D'Arthur in an abridged version and Roger Lancelyn Green's ""King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table"" from the Puffin Classics series. I enjoyed Green's telling the best, as it was credibly compiled from a number of works (including Malory) and had some excellent atmospheric illustrations. Though it is a Puffin Classics edition, I did not find the usual condescension or ""dumbing down"" that often occurs in youth literature.Get Green's version. It was just as cheap right here on Amazon, and well worth every penny."
5,"A very good book, and a great adaptation.",Our 6 yr old granddaughter loves the story. We bought three of the classics and will probably buy even more.
4,Great starters for our 4 year old son,"I know a lot of people don't care for these books because they say they're dumbed down. For older kids, probably true. But I think they're great starters for our 4 year old son. I'm hoping by reading these he will want to read the original classics when he's older."
2,Disappointing,"After having read and loved Howard Pyle's 1968 Classic Pressedition of ""The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood"" I was quitedisappointed with ""The Story of King Arthur and His Knights"".Whereas Pyle brilliantly brought his characters to life in ""RobinHood"", the characters of ""King Arthur"" seem flat and lifelessby comparison. The King Arthur stories read like little morethan a description of events; one doesn't really get a feelingof being there while things are happening as in ""Robin Hood.""The dialogue seems much more realistic in ""Robin Hood"", but Ithink there's more to it. The writing style in ""King Arthur""I'd characterize as prosaic---in sharp contrast to the charming, poetic style of writing in ""Robin Hood."""
1,Abridged,The book is listed as an unabridged version. Wrong!In truth it is an abridged version copyrighted in 2005. The original is like 1902.Very Disappointed!! I'll be returning this!
1,Accurate editing needed,"This book needs to be re-edited. There are too many grammatical and spelling mistakes. Please pay attention to this! I had hoped to use this version with middle school students, but there were just too many errors."
3,good but kind of slow,"The Story of King Arthur and His Knights is a pretty good book. I would recommend the book. However, its not perfect. the story is slow-placed at times, and some parts of the story aren't explained, leaving a few plot-holes. but other than that it is good."
1,Avoid this one like the plague!,"I've never in my life seen a movie so terrible, it made me wish I was dead, that is until I saw King Frat!"
5,YUMMY ! Great recipes,This book is amazing I love the recipes. There are delicious and so simple to prepare. Some of the recipes can take quite a while to cook (the beef bourguignon for instance) but the results are amazingHere's a list of all of the recipes I have made from the cookbook to date. All of them are absolutely delicious.1. Beef bourguigon2. Black forest3. The Banana Banoffi (so delicious)4. Salmon pie5. Grilled garlic lobsterI can't wait to try more recipes.
2,Disappointed,"I was so excited to get this cookbook after reading numerous reviews, but so far I've been disappointed. I made the chocolate muffins. All the chocolate chips sunk to the bottom of the muffins and stuck in the pan. They looked nothing like the picture. Then I tried the Parmesan Zucchini which was bland. I also made the Salmon Pasta Gratin. The directions were very vague. I was to dilute the wine in a glass of hot water. What size of glass? 6 oz, 8 oz? Then I finished the dish and noticed I omitted the parmesan cheese. Parmesan cheese was listed in the ingredients, but never mentioned in the directions. Not sure I'll try another recipe from this book."
5,Very nice book,"I'm always looking for cookbook with simple recipes, and that's what I like about this recipe book.The recipes are really easy to follow and absolutely delicious. Yesterday I made ""The scallop in a white wine sauce"" YUMMY!!!! My husband loved it! I also tried the raspberry charlotte, Stunning............All I have to say is that the recipes in this book are amazing. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for simples and delicious recipes."
2,"Terrible graphics, OK recipes","As soon as I opened this book, I didn't want to make any of the recipes, simply because the pictures were so awful. The layout is amatuerish and the photos are simply unappetizing. Presentation counts almost as much as flovor- if this is what my meals are going to look like, then I'll pass."
5,WE ALL NEED TO READ THIS ONE & PASS IT ON!,"WOW! She did her homework! It is all in here. Some startling insights and provocative thinking. After you read this one, you may rethink your reality. Perhaps we all need to read this to make sure we haven't overlooked some significant details! This should be in EVERY school, EVERY hospital, EVERY clinic, EVERY doctors office and every child protection agency office. If you suspect Abuse- get this book. You will gain valuable insight and will be able to see things you might otherwise have missed!"
1,Motherboard defect,I have had the vgn-s260p since 2005 and 2 days ago the motherboard went bad. I read forums and found out that this model and other models have a common problem with the motherboard and video going bad. I confirmed the problem by calling sony customer support and even though it is a common problem sony will not fix my laptop without having to pay a $700 repair cost.After this incident i am never buying a Sony product again.
3,The worst movie ever? AWESOME BAD,"So bad. Atrocious. The worst fight scenes ever. If you love Blaxsploitation you'll love it - for how truly low budget a film can be. I've seen better acting in porn movies, and better film on teeth ! Hilarious."
4,old school movie's,"got it for a friend, and they love it. they like alot of old school movie's. most of them are action."
2,Polder Dryer all wet,"The Polder dryer is wall mounted and comes with two sets of mounts so you can hang it in two different spaces. A nice feature. But, the rack really doesn't support much weight - when you consider how heavy a wet sweater is. If you only handwash one piece at a time that you need to lay flat to dry it will work okay, but not if you need more capacity."
3,Polder Wal-Mount Review,I was somewhat disappointed by the quality of the product. I was expecting something made of metal but much plastic is involved. Also it is not very big. The Amazon service and delivery was satisfactory.
3,"So, So.",The product is not as sturdy as I would have liked. The brackets used to mount to the wall are plastic. I thought they would be metal as are the rods to hang clothes on. I am not sure how long they will last due to the weight of the clothes hanging up. The pictures are a little decieving as you do not get a good view of the wall mounting brackets. I would be willing to pay a little more for a better product.
2,Not very sturdy,"We ordered this product and ultimately decided not to put it up. The rack is plastic an isn't very sturdy. The packaging came busted up with screws loose rolling around in the packaging. I mistakenly got rid of the busted up box or I would probably have returned it. For the money I spent, I was able to find a metal rack that is much sturdier and easier to install."
3,kinda flimsy soft bendy plastic,"well it does what it says, but as the title says it looks fragile and it is a bit flimsy but hey it works"
5,"Polder Wall-Mount 24-Inch Accordion Clothes Dryer, White",Love this clothes dryer. It was fairly easy to mount. Works great. It is a little smaller than the stand up clothes dryer but love the fact it is off the floor. Looks a little flimsy but it really does hold up and holds clothes fine. I have had no problems with it and would recommend it.
2,Feels like cheap junky plastic.,Photo looked like stainless steel but it is very light plastic. And my handy son gave up on installing it for me.
1,OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGG,This product absolutely sucks. It's flimsy and not well designed. My wife just laughed at it when i installed it and refuses to go near it because it looks like it will just fall off the wall. A total waste of cash.....
3,It's no same to see in the webpage.,"Easy to install, easy to use, but it's a little weak, you don't put on this a rug or more of 3 jeans pants. if you use for a light clothes it's good, but it isn't for heavy weight."
4,Diaper Rack,"I bought this for our cloth diapers. It can hold about six prefolds and four to five covers. We mounted it near our radiator and everything was dry in the morning. Mind you, we use a spin dryer to get the water out, so things dry faster.The mounting was a bit difficult as the screws didn't go in too far.Overall, considering the price, a good investment. I also bought some hanging laundry hooks to use with this to hang things straight down. I wouldn't use this for anything heavy."
5,Works Good,I have been handing sweaters over the top and shirts from hangers and it holds up well. It is exactly what I was looking for.
4,Space saver,Very nice product. It will save a lot of space in your bathroom and still look slim and nice. I am recomending this product to anyone with not heavy cloth.
3,Broadway Review,"I titled the review Broadway as I felt I was in the theatre and observing a play in action on the stage. One of the actors in this television series is primary a stage actor which one can tell. Their pronunication of the word is exact and the voice very strong. Their presents on the set was that on the stage. Television flows differently and that flow did not exist. The story lines were good in the beginning, but as the series continued, they bogged down in content."
2,Not the best study guide available,"I used this book in a TOEFL preparation course for about a month and found it a bit disappointing. The book's explanations are quite technical (which is sometimes helpful, especially in the grammar section) but my intermediate-level students all found the practice exercises in the book too easy. The CD-ROM practice tests, on the other hand, were too hard. Some of the Writing section's explanations were good--especially with thesis statements and conclusions--but the Reading section was ridiculously banal. In addition, there aren't enough practice tests, especially in comparison with other TOEFL study materials available on the market. For the price you're paying, you'd be better off buying Longman's Complete Preparation (for intermediate to advanced students), Longman's Introductory Preparation (for beginner students), or Barron's TOEFL book with 8 practice tests."
1,Beware of Kaplan books and courses (spread the word),"Due to my position (Human Resources Director) in an American multinational company located in Bogota, Colombia, and having studied English in the United Kingdom, I decided it was time to study for an MBA in order to further my career. I needed 250 on the CBT Toefl. I was advised to attend the best and most expensive prep center, Kaplan Bogota, so I did. I took the TOEFL twice. The first time I scored 207 and the second time 190, very far from the score I needed for my MBA. Seriously, I don't know how could somebody claim to have scored 290 with Kaplan preparation, and even less with this Kaplan TOEFL book that I recently disposed in the garbage. Moreover checking the ETS's statistics for the last 3 years and the standard deviation for Toefl scores, no one has scored above 287. Therefore I find very dubious some reports stated herein. Use common sense and never enroll in a Kaplan course."
5,Lady Day's Best Work Despite The Bad Times She Had,"There are two schools of fans when it comes to Lady Day :(1) fans who loved her voice when she was strong and brilliant, resounding with a fine vibratto before the drugs came into play and (2) the post-drug Holiday who still can swing and jazz the songs up fine and dandy, even singing songs that are heartbreaking to her. I belong to the second. Holiday has a brilliant touch in singing jazz, blues and, yes, even love songs. Her brilliance shines so strongly in this CD that you can feel every beat of her heart that saw rough times. I have never heard a better version of P.S. I Love You or I Thought About You. Aside from the wonderful interpretation brought by her, the CD quality sound of the songs brings her voice alive and well. Lady Day deserves to be heard by her fans, especially those who love to hear her swing or cry about this thing called love."
2,Not great,"While I love Billie, in her own words, these sessions were dull, and uninspired. Since the reviews should focus on one CD, that is the jist of it; boring renditions, and back up musicians that are not the ones that Billie was used to making for a very uneven collection."
2,Careful! Not Complete!,Amazon says this is a volume of Poe's complete works. Uh-uh. Only the poetry.
1,the dreaded poetry book,"I would not recommend this poem book to people unless they like reading this type of poetry, or poetry in general. While I was reading these poems, I found it very hard to concentrate on the poem I was reading, because the poems didn't really catch my interest. I don't think I would enjoy reading another poetry book bye Edgar Allen Poe because I don't really like his type of poetry. My mind wandered a lot while I was reading Poe's poems because they weren't exciting, they were sad, scary, and gloomy."
3,Nostalgic and well acted.,"The strength of this English mini-series is the gorgeous setting in Cornwall, where a group of cousins vacation in their Aunt's cliffside home and where grows the lawn of the title.The onset of WWII shatters this idyllic scene. But we find out through the story that all was not as peaceful as we thought when the secrets of incest and child abuse come to light.I loved the first three episodes of this delightfully nostalgic series. The randy sexcapades of London under fire were fun and revealing. The portrayal of the tendency of families to protect child abusers came out in the later episodes and was not so appealing. However, one wants to know how it ends!The first three episodes get five stars, the last two are unfortunately not as good."
4,Excellent Period Drama,"Chamomile Lawn follows the lives of half a dozen cousins and their friends during WWII. The Chamomile Lawn itself is a beautiful old Victorian located on the cliffs in Cornwall. The cousins lives intertwine, intermingle and at times incestuous relationships form. I particularly liked Sophie, Calypso and the twins.At first I found the series a bit difficult to get into. Some of the characters are cold and a bit selfish. Also the child abuse and the incest is somewhat distasteful. But eventually I found myself really enjoying the scenery, the characters and the involved plot.4 stars."
2,Very Mediocre,"I wanted to watch this movie mainly because of Jennifer Ehle. Ms. Ehle played Elizabeth Bennett is the very lovely-made version of Pride and Prejudice. However, I did not like her character or her blonde hair. The story, mostly told in flashback, was poorly done and somewhat confusing. I was very glad when the film ended."
2,WHO THREW THAT CHAIR ONTO THE SET?,"I watched this when it came out, and have returned to it years later.And how different it seems in retrospect.The acting is wooden - it's as if someone threw a chair onto the set. There are some good performances but in the main the order of the day is clipped upper class Englishness with warmth and humanity drained away. All very sterile.The writing and dialogue is at times painful, stilted and unreal, with the delivery of lines from the actors forced and almost alien.Some other strange stuff too: the uncle liked little girls (in a sexual way)and this was shrugged off as mild eccentricity. How times have changed since the 1990s !What is good about this series is the historical references and the depiction and sense of the war years.Well worth watching but not the greatest piece of drama."
4,engrossing story,"this story caught my attention immediately. I am a fan of many of the stars and it was interesting to see them play roles very different from my original introduction (Jennifer Ehle as someone other than Elizabeth Bennett and Felicity Kendall as someone other than Rosemary Boxer). I was a little surprised by the sexual content and nudity but it was nothing offensive.My only problem is the ""up in the air"" ending. I find this a quite common in BBC productions (Ballykissangel for one), maybe it's because they are so interesting and engaging that I don't want them to end."
2,Not as I remember,I used to watch the Perry Como show as a kid and thought he was cool back then. This CD was a bit disappointing - I thought the music was listless and didn't have quite the Christmas spirit/enthusiasm as I had hoped.
3,Good special effects but not much heart.,"This remake of the Boris Karloff classic reminded me of the recent remake of The Haunting, with big-budget special effects attempting to replace atmosphere and chills. In both films, it fails to work. I liked the panoramic, computer-generated views of the ancient city, but the main characters are ditzy, and most of the humor falls flat."
2,"Amusement park entertainment in a theatre! Oh,joy....","Special effects extravaganza, without a doubt. Very beautiful people, (especially Oded Fehr who adroitly delivers the only bearable character). Otherwise, populated by shallow and stereotypic personages. Script hangs by a thread with tongue-in-cheek humor. Oded Fehr admonishes while Brandon Frasier smirks, Rachel Weiss bubbles, John Hannah whines, and Arnold Vosloo up-chucks. Just what you'd expect on a roller-coaster ride."
3,Good special effects movie.,"This movie was a bit of a disappointment. The special effects were incredible and it was a fun movie to watch, but it was campy."
3,"Ok, as long as you don't know your history.","I thought that the movie had many interesting scenes, and the recostruction of what the pyramids would have looked like then was nice, however imhotep was a carpenter, not a priest. Anyway, that is one small error amongst several. Unfortunately I was taking egyptian history when this movie came out, which ruined the impact for me due to a few errors on the side of the movies historical accuracy. Oh well. Some of the computer effects looked downright fake as well, but some looked really good. That's all I have to say about that ;)."
3,Would have been better w/out the goofy George of the Jungle,"During the opening sequence of this movie, I was in awe! It was so enchanting and a real feel for ancient Egypt. But then the minute Fraser appeared on the screen it became a goofy, cutsey movie. Personally, I would have liked the movie to be more serious. But I will admit that I did enjoy it, and I have a new appreciation for Arnold Vosloo (some of this other stuff has been a bit cheesey). This is not a horror movie, it's an adventure movie. It tries to be cute and funny, sometimes successfully, sometimes not. Definitely enjoyable to watch, but not worth buying."
3,Indiana Jones wanna be,"If you're looking for characters to really care about and a ""don't know what comes next"" plot, don't look here. On the other hand, if you want as one reviewer put it ""eye candy"", then this is a good movie for you. Personally, I was left wanting to know more about Imotep (beyond the 10 minute setup at the beginning) and the cliche humor got a little old by the end of the movie. Yet even despite obvious attempts at being ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Mummy"", I can't deny the stunning panoramas, occasionally funny moments, and special effects. I'd rent it, but I wouldn't buy it."
5,Get Ready to Be Mummified,Think the best speical effects movie ever made & the best classic monster movie ever made with a little spice of comedymixed in. This highly updated version of a Universal Classic is sertanly worth your money And for all Brendan Fraser Fans out there in think you will agree this has to be one of his best peices of work so far. With the lead as Brendan Fraser and the hilarious side jokes by John Hannah this movie get a 5+++
3,NICE MOVIE BUT BAD DISK,"I got this movie with my HD DVD player, plays nice and has awesome special features. The big drawback is that the movie freezes about 3/4 in the movie. Upgrading firmware did NOT solve the problem."
5,Great,"Great movie. Full of action, corpses, skeletal demons, and of ther things. The best part is with the scantily-clad hottie at the beginning. Oh Man she was a hottie!! OHHH!!!Other good movies are Dragonheart and Tremors."
4,Good film,"This is still the best of the 3 mummy movies. I thought the film looked great in Blu-Ray. Very crisp and detailed. I always liked the chemistry between Rachel Weisz (one of my favorite actresses) and Brendan Fraser. The special effects throughout the film are very good. Sometimes the acting and script is a little too cheesy, and the John Hannah character can be very annoying (he plays Rachel Weisz' brother in the film), but the filmmakers were obviously going for the Indiana Jones ""matinee"" feel so it's forgivable. Not a great film but fun. I believe Rachel Weisz carries this film, however, and it wouldn't have worked without her."
4,Don't expect Indiana Jones and it will be good,"I watched this movie for the first time after a friend told me it was just like Indiana Jones. With that in mind I watched and hated this movie. It took me several more attempts through the years to get that mentality out of my mind and watch this for what it is.This is more akin to Pirates of the Caribbean than it is to any Indian Jones movie. Where Indiana Jones is 90% archaeology and history and 10% Sci-Fi / Occult this is probably the exact reverse. The dialogue, though not great, is decent and funny at times. The protagonists are a motley bunch that stumble into success and find trouble easily. All in all it is a good film to watch.The basic story is that a historian/ librarian with her pocket picking brother and a wayward adventurer manage to unleash a curse that was put away 5000 years ago. Now it is a race against time and supernatural demons to save the Earth."
2,Yet another of those..,"Just another mainstream sci-fi wanna-be-great film wrapped in a commercial packing. Watch it a dull sunday afternoon when there's nothing else on tv, but not worth buying on dvd."
2,HD DVD Video Quality Review,"This HD-DVD uses the same transfer as the standard DVD from 1999. Although the increased resolution offers far more detail, defects such as dirt & film weave are now more apparent. The contrast seems to be artificially lifted, clipping details both in the high and low end of the image (The Universal logo at the beginning of the film never looked this ugly), making it look processed and not film-like.Compared to reference HD-DVDs auch as ""King Kong"" this is a slightly below average transfer (2/5)"
5,Wow - where do I start?,"First of all, the special FX are amazing! It's extremely funny, and a little creepy later on ...So it's not 'scream your head off' scary, SO WHAT? it's a great combination of a comedy, a thriller, a horror and a historical action adventure.A bit gross in some places, this is a great movie. A must see for anybody."
2,Neither here nor there,"I'm still not sure whether this film was intended to be a spoof or not. If so, it lacked enough laughs to be considered as such. On the other hand, if it was intended as a serious horror film it also fell short of the mark. There wasn't a single moment of tension. All in all, it was a bit like a carry on film. Not a patch on the Indiana Jones films."
3,Worst or best ?,This film was nothing like I excepted. I did think it would be a horror film but it's more of a indiana johns film. Not that I mind that it was just a shock. Would I rush would and buy this film again ? properly not. It was enjoyable but there are many better films out there that I would have prefered to watch.
2,Very Cheesy,"Like the reviews says, if you're looking for a shallow, cheesy movie, this is the movie for you.Cliches? Check. Annoying bad guy lackey? Double check. Predictable plot, mostly a vehicle for special effects? Check.I mean, you've got a guy alone in a tunnel, and you need to grab his body, so you just grab his tongue and eyes? Makes for some icky looking scenes as he tries to talk and wanders around blindly with bandages over his eyes, but I can't even begin to understand why, except for the icky scenes. Plus it gives the lackey a chance to show what an evil double crossing lackey he is. That's the sort of movie this is.It's Indiana Jones without good acting, but on the plus side it has cool special effects."
1,Don't buy the full screen version,"Be carefully which version buy. Unlike other studios that offers both full and widescreen on the same DVD, Universal is dumb and greedy enough to release two versions. Check the right version before you buy. The full frame version must from the VHS tape master which is less detail and grainy compares to the widescreen version not to mention mutilated the film.The sound is the same for both films, which are good but not great. Wish they had DTS version instead of the full frame.Four stars for the widescreen version on audio and video.Three stars for the content as a decent B movie."
2,For the Mindless Only,"The Mummy moves far too fast to be a good horror flick,and it's far too predictable to be a good action movie. Substituting special effects for plot development and real acting, the Mummy will satisfy most viewers looking for mindless escapism. However, anyone looking for anything deeper will walk away disappointed. Save your money and go see the Sixth Sense while it's still in the theaters."
4,"Not ""Great"" but a ""Good"" one!","All right - I admit, the movie is good: Good jokes, good action, good sound, A-M-A-Z-I-N-G special effects, a little bit of frightning here, a little bit of frightning there.. Well, ok, so what this a ""4 star movie"" and not ""5 star""? It's resemblance to Indiana Jones! I know it's a totaly different story and all, but I can't help it - It's just too similar in the music, the places shown and the characters.."
2,Great Trailer - Terrible movie,The trailer does an excellent job of bamboozling you into thinking this will be a spectacular movie. It's attempt at comedy were near-insulting. The acting reminded me of high school drama. This movie is definitely for the younger folks. 2 stars for effects only.
3,"Great entertainment, horrible history !","Wonderful entertainment, lousey ancient history !Imhotep was a genius, not an ""evil"" genius. No evidence in the literature or archeology for the ""evil"" part."
2,Don't bother,"I was very disappointed in this movie. Too many typical scenes, an unconvinsing villian, a screwball hero and idiots all around him. It was more like a national lampoon version. I did like the way the mummy traveled, but I wish the story was better, and I wish there was more real wonder and a thought-provoking plot."
4,Funniest Horror movie I've ever seen!,"Okay, so the critics didn't really enjoy The Mummy. I can understand why. Not all of the acting is so great, the plot is very simular to Bram Stoker's Dracula, and some of the humor is a little cheesy. But that doesn't make it a bad flick. I thought that the humor and horror elements played well off of each other, the special effects were amazing, and the action sequences were flawless. To tell the truth, I would have given it five stars, except for my one small complaint. I really wish that at the end of the flick, The Mummy had actually won."
2,Rent this for you and your friends,"to make fun of. This was a poor attempt at camp. The acting was way too over the top, the plot was paper thin. The special F/X were the only redeeming quality. If you truly want fun and camp rent ""Army of Darkness"" or ""Big Trouble in Little China"". This one isn't worth it, unless it's on cable late at night."
3,"Campy and cheesy, but had good special effects.","I first wanted to see this movie when I saw the ad for it during the Super Bowl. We had been studying Egypt in my history class, so I had wanted to go see how accurate it was to real life. The day it came out, my dad's friend saw it and said it was very lame. My dad told me that I should wait until it comes out on video to see it. A few months later, I picked up a copy at Blockbuster and watched it that night. I was hoping to see a non-stop, well-acted thrill ride, but instead, I saw a bad Indiana Jones rip-off. The plotline was very cheesy, the acting was terrible, and the movie is very confusing at times. The reason I gave this movie 3 stars is for the special effects. I had a good time at parts of the movie, but the best parts were shown on the trailer. Don't waste your money on this one.Here's a list of similar (and better) movies:1.Raiders of the Lost Ark2.Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom3.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade4.Stargate"
1,Stupid absolutely horrible!,This was one of the worst movies! I have seen to date! If you enjoy this there is something truly wrong with you. How can one man get away from danger so much?!Its special effects nothing more and a lot less! Brendan Fraser is a bad actor with a soon to be short movie career! Boo to the people that enjoy this movie! Hooray to the people who understand what I mean!
1,bleh!,"Words cannot describe my excitement for this movie. However, five minutes into the movie a feeling of dread fell over me. My girlfriend leaned over to me and asked, ""Is this a comedy?"" What happened here, this is supposed to be a horror movie, not a slapstick comedy. I enjoyed Steven Sommer's Deep Rising, but this is ludicrous. Fraser churns out the typical Hollywood tough guy character. Rachel Weisz, is nice to look at, but not to listen to. The special effects are decent enough, but they seem to be more important in the movie than the actual conflict. This came out the same summer as the awful Austin Powers 2, and the even worse Deep Blue Sea, t'was a bleak summer for me. If it wasn't for The Matrix, I would have given up on movies all together."
1,Horrible!!,"As one of the other reviewers noted -- it frightens me that so many others thought so highly of this movie. Acting and story were terrible, pacing was worse -- even the FX weren't that great."
1,Pathetic Waste of Time,"My vote for worst movie of the year. I kept hopeing that all of the characters would get eaten by bugs or slaughtered by the pharohs guards ASAP as they were all so incredibly STUPID they might as well have been begging for it. Don't even try to compare this piece of *** to Indiana Jones or Stargate. The scariest thing about this film is all of the 5-star ratings that I see here. I'll really think twice next time before buying a film on the basis of one of these reviews. BTW, I sometimes think that professional movie critics are overly hard on some films for not being ""deep"" or intelectual enough. In this case though I think they were right on."
1,Terrible movie. Don't waste your time or money.,"After viewing for about 10 minutes, I noticed a disagreeable odor being emitted from the disc. It wasn't the disc, it was that stupid movie. If this is what passes for entertainment now days, we are in worse shape than I imagined."
1,no no no no NO!!,"This movie sucks big time, although the special effects were OK. ILM could of done alot better. PLEASE STAY WELL CLEAR OF THIS FILM!! Would the producers of this film please promise us that they won't make a sequel. ILM please don't work with these films. Their ruining your reputation."
1,Encino Man goes to Egypt,"After watching the Mummy the entire cast of the movie should of been mummified and place in a crypt for eternity. The acting was horrible and the special effects were at best "" chessy "". The Mummy in my opinion was the worst movie of 1999. I wouldn't recommend this DVD."
1,YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!,"A huge disappointment. The creature was a poor ""Terminator"" rip-off. The acting was terrible, and the movie's slapsticky tone was extremely annoying. One of the worst movies of the year!"
2,More sizzle than steak....,"I tire easily of movies that use special efforts as justification for their existence. ""The Mummy"" is just such a picture. I am of the opinion that special effects should be used like salt and pepper, i.e., to be used sparingly to enhance the experience. However, just as I would never recommend a meal based on spices, I don't recommend movies that have tons of special effects, but with a weak story line and weak acting.Leave this movie for the ""techies"" who have to have the ""latest and greatest"" in their technological whiz-bang world."
5,Terrific!,"I have to say I was totally blown away by the picture quality, it's one of the best I've seen so far, absolutely fantastic, makes you want to watch it over and over again. The sound is excellent as well! This is definitely one movie to own on blu-ray. You simply can't go wrong!"
4,Classic Horror Fun,"I loved this movie at the theatre.. When it came out on DVD it was a 'must-have' for me. My husband thought it too campy,(he hadn't seen it at the theatre, so was going on my recommendations). The special effects are great, the scariness & campiness are a wonderful throwback & nod to those great classic scary films I enjoyed so much as a kid. Well worth getting I thought!"
3,The Mummy Full Screen??? YUUUUUCK!!,"I was somewhat disappointed by this ""ultimate"" edition of The Mummy. I like the movie and already own the collector's edition. Still I ordered the ""ultimate"" edition because I was hoping for tons of extras. Imagine my surprise when I found that disc 2 contained the FULL SCREEN (ptooey!) version. WHAT A COMPLETE WASTE OF VALUABLE DISC SPACE!! Also the previews for The Mummy Returns are not very helpful, now that the movie already runs in theaters and will be out on DVD soon. I guess the ""ultimate"" edition could've been a LOT more ultimate for my taste... Well, but the movie is still fun to watch and the picture and sound quality is fabulous. JUST LOOSE THOSE NO-GOOD FULL SCREEN VERSIONS!!"
5,"""THE BEST...""","I loved this movie! I thought it was kind of disgusting when I saw it in the theatres, but I've gotten over it. I especially like the part when Imhotep (a.k.a. the mummy) creates a sand-wall and makes his face appear in it. And I also liked it when Mr. Burns' glasses were broke and he was lost deep down inside the City of the Dead, Hamunaptra (in Egypt of course). And then he meets Imhotep. In this movie, Imhotep must forfill a mission that involves sucking people's skin off to regenerate. Then he goes after some girl names Eeve so he can bring his dead girlfriend, Anack-Su-Namun, back to life. All goes well for Imhotep until Brendan Frasier defeats him. That's why I like this movie because it has lots of action, and special-effects. This is a must-own!"
3,so much promise lost,"The Mummy has some of the best and original special effects in a movie in a while. That is about the extent of its good parts.Sure, it is fun to watch once (I am noticing this trend with a lot of movies lately), but in actuality it has bad humor, little adventure, and absolutely no scares.If I go see a Mummy movie I want to be scared, not watch a bad Indiana Jones knock-off, and that is all this movie is. Rent it, but I can't imagine owning it."
3,Fun movie; awful soundtrack,"I could not find the widescreen version, so I settled for the full screen. Several areas of the DVD had awful electronic noise. Toward the end of the movie, it was very distracting. I returned the DVD. I then saw it on PPV. Not as many electronic noise entries, but they were in the same places as on the DVD. The audio track needs to be redone."
5,"Movie gets 4 stars, bonus items get 5","The reviews were very unfair to this movie, it is a great piece of entertainment and 100% faithful to the spirit of those 30's movies. The special features explaining how the shots were done (on the DVD) are worth the price of admission."
4,A vastly amusing movie,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. While it lacks the lovely atmospheric creepiness of the 1932 film it claims to be a remake of, it has a good-natured sense of adventure and is well cast. In truth it seems to be more of a remake in the style of Hammer Studio's Mummy films, but thankfully does not include the title character lurching around shedding bandages everywhere. Considering the stomach-dropping, heart-sickening disappointment the other big ""horror"" remake,""The Haunting,"" from the summer this film came out, and despite the occasional plot-hole (but let's face it, this film wasn't intended to be a ground-breaking, truth-shattering film, it was meant to be entertainment), ""The Mummy"" did not deserve the poor reviews it got from the critics."
4,Indy is back - sort of...,"The first couple of minutes of a movie means everything. It sets the entire mood for the rest of the picture... and this one caught my undivided attention. The intro scene with the sphinx is the perfect example. My hat is off for one of the unsung heroes of movie magic: Jerry Goldsmith. His Egyptian style music is breathtaking and is the perfect addition to ILM's high quality special effects. As for the movie in general, it's the best adventure movie since Indiana Jones, especially since the Mummy is the ONLY one during the nineties that reaches the same level of fun and excitement. I didn't give it five stars because it is reserved for the Best Film of 1999: The Matrix."
5,Awesome DVD!!,"I had the original DVD of the Mummy and as soon as I found out that they were coming out with an Ultimate Edition, I immediately sold my old one and bought the new one. It's almost the same as the first DVD except that now there is a DTS soundtrack. There are a few other extras but for me the main reason to buy it was watching it in DTS. As far as the movie itself, yes its no horror movie, but it is a fun summer movie. Great action, great special effects and lots of laughs. Not a film to take seriously but a film to go in and have a good time, for me anyway. If you are a fan of the movie and you have a DVD player, this is a must get."
4,A spoof in the same league as Indiana Jones's last crusade,"This movie was, without doubt, one of the best for the year if what you seek is to be entertained. If you are looking for something to calm you troubled sole and bid you rest look somewhere else. The special effects are a tribute to modern movie making and succeed in bringing you face to face with imagination. Well done and thank you producers, directors, cast and crew."
5,I love the bit when the mummy tries to bring back the Queen,The Mummy was the best movie I have ever seen. It has great special effects and I like the bit at the beggining when they tell you the story about the priest and the queen. The Bugs that eat people are really freaky and the Movie sure makes you jump out your seat. This Movie sure deserves a 5 out of 5. I really cant think of anyone who would not like such a fab and brilliant movie.
5,"Its not a horror flick, but its very entertaining.","It may not be a horror flick, but this movie gives you non-stop action/comedy/special fx. I highly recomend it. Others have rated it as a ""hockey"" horror movie, however thats not what it was. This movie is very entertaining and thats what counts!"
1,Good hollywood thinking,When I saw this movie I was so grateful that the producers didn't waste any money on screenwriters directors or actors... they sunk every penny into special effects... isn't that what America wants?
1,Worst movie ever,A good example of what is wrong with Hollywood today. I have never looked at my watch more times during a movie in my life. Brendan Fraser is one of the worst actors ever.
1,TROUGH OUT,I HAVE WATCHED THIS FOOLISH MOVIE A MONTH AGO. IT'S FOR FOOLISH PEOPLE WHO HAS NO TIME TO FINDOUT A BETTER MOVIE LIKE ME MY WIFE ASK ME WHY IT FOOLISH IS BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER SEEN A MUMMY !! WHICH SCARE OF A STUPID CAT IF TELL THE TRUTH THIS MOVIE HELPS EGYPT TO BRING SOME FOOLISH TOURISTS TO EGYPT. TOWN OF TERRORISM BY THE WAY I HOPE THERE WILL BE NO TERRORISM IN EGYPT SOON .
1,Just falls flat.,"This movie had potential for being good, however the desire to make money ruined that potential. What we're left with is the generic tale of a mummy out for revenge."
1,"cheep effects, not worth buying at all","the acting was pretty cheesy, and the special effects were not at all realistic. Not a good movie at all."
5,3000 year old terror unearthed...,"City of the Dead - Hamunaptra...burial site of an 3000 year old evil so evil that when set free, it will bring along with it the 10 pleagues of hell...Enjoy the DVD with beautiful scences from Egypt in year 1920s, brought back to life right before you. Listen to the cool suuround effect your surround systems delivers to you. Just these reasons are enough to convince you to buy this DVD title.Watching with minors around? Don't worry, not a gross scence from this title. In fact, not even a drop of blood was shown throughout the whole 2 hrs 5 mins. But it all fun and excitement for the whole family...So what are you waiting for? Go buy now!"
4,Great visual effects,"Though this movie feels like a remake of the fantastic Indy Jones series (I know its predecessor was the Mummy from 193x), it is a clever remake. Actually only the colors and the moods are copied. The story is idiotic, but the movie is real fun (it has a great trash value). The tech part is perfect and Imhotep is really scary as the mummy who comes alive after 3000 years. The acting is poor (Mr. Fraser and Ms.Weisz look good but can't act)."
3,AVERAGE MOVIE--GREAT DVD,"THIS MOVIE WAS MILDLY ENTERTAINING. IT CONSPICUOUSLY BORROWS FROM THE INDIANA JONES SCHOOL OF ACTION/ADVENTURE CINEMA. THE EFFECTS ARE SPECTACULAR--BUT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH OF THAT TO KEEP THE VIEWERS ATTENTION. MOSTLY YOU HAVE TO ENDURE SOME FAIRLY CLICHED ACTING AND PREDICTABLE KILLINGS OF THE SUPPORTING CAST. THE REALLY CAPTIVATING PART OF THE MOVIE WAS THE INTRODUCTION, WHERE THE VILLAIN WAS INTRODUCED IN THE SETTING OF ANCIENT THEBES--AND INDUSTRIAL LIGHT AND MAGIC (ILM) REALLY OUTDID ITSELF ON PROTRAYING THE VAST SWEEP OF THAT BEAUTIFUL CITY. WHILE THE MOVIE WAS MEDIOCRE, THE DVD WAS ITSELF A FUN DIVERSION. IT HAD SOME FEATURES I HAVE SEEN ON ONLY A FEW OTHER DVDS--A PC GAME, SCREEN SAVERS, EMAIL POST CARDS, AND SEVERAL NARRATED CLIPS ILLUSTRATING HOW THE ILM CREW CREATED SOME KEY EFFECTS FOR THE FILM. ALL-IN-ALL, IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO EXPAND YOUR DVD COLLECTION, I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS DVD."
2,Dummy Mummy,"This movie at times seemed to parellel The Indiana Jones movies, down to near direct quotes ""I hate snakes"" however in The Mummy it was ""I hate bugs"". Alot of the sets and costumes were Indiana Jones inspired.Not only were the actors as dry as the desert they were in, there were it seemed a series of endless shootout scenes, horses running, guns firing, dust flying. These action sequences are nothing more than time fillers and BOREING to watch. The humour in The Mummy was a total distraction and offset the mood of the entire film. It turned into this hokey comedy of sorts, which truely rings pathetic in my book.The romance and pychological aspects of the older monster movies is missing here. It has been replaced by mindless special effects, and what seemed like an endless array of confusing action sequences. Dull characters, dull storyline plus dazzling special effects equal dumb movie. You need more than cool effects!"
3,There is no musical score on the DVD!,"I have bought the DVD, and confirmed with the data on iMDB, there is no musical score on the DVD! Am I missing something here?"
1,Yawn!!!,"I figured that the reason I fell asleep the first time I tried to watch this movie was just because I was tired. Tried to watch it again and the same thing happened.Special affects were good. The rest of the movie just stunk. Plot holes to drive a truck through. poor acting and some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard were enough to move this into my list of all time worst movies.Of course the inane premise should have been enough to warn me off. Let me sum it up. Egyptian High Priest is screwing around with the Pharoah's mistress. He does this out in the open where Pharoah can walk in. Pharoah comes in and with his bodygaurds right behind him. The kill him.What do they do to punish this high priest? They put a curse on him where if he is ever released, he will be the most powerful creature to ever walk the planet and end all life as we know it. Ummmm... Why not just torture him for a while and then kill him...."
1,For the brain dead only,"The fact that this movie has been compared to Raiders of the Lost Ark is sacrilege. This is a pale imitation of several different (and better) films made by people who seem to think that special effects make a good substitute for an original story and decent characterisation. The stereotyping of the characters is annoying and offensive. The Egyptians are all dirty and rude, the Americans are gun-crazy rambo's, the English are bumbling idiots (we're not all librarians you know!). Rachel Weisz and John Hannah were painful to watch at times. The most interesting character was Ardeth Bey who only had a small supporting role. Completely disappointing - it could've been so much better."
1,terrible,the only thing you get here is special effects. the story is weak if i have ever seen one and Brenden Fraser is a really bad actor. don't see it!
1,A total waste of my money and time,"There is not much of anything good I can say about The Mummy. The truth is, Brendan Fraser can't carry a movie. The creative team behind the movie knew this, so they tried to jazz it up with lots of hokey special effects. The script was even worse. I do have one question, why didn't they show all of the plagues instead of only like four of them? But, anyway, this movie was just another let down in the mold of Godzilla (1998), because I was really looking forward to its release, but the hype was too much and the result was a horrible waste of my time and money."
4,The Mummy,"Great action movie, a little comedy, romance, and special effects. The blu ray transfer, ""WOW"", clear, crisp, picture and great sound. One of the few movies on blu ray I highly recommend. A must have in your movie library. Enjoy!"
3,Good.....but not great.,"Ok, folks, this movie was ok. However, anyone who would give it five stars is a moron. This was not a GREAT movie it was a GOOD movie. I also can't see how anyone can compare this movie with Raiders of the Lost Ark. That was a GREAT movie. It was nominated for best picture. It was original. How much slapstick comedy did you see in Raiders? How many cliches did you catch in Raiders? There is a difference between slapstick/stupid comedy and true witty humor. It's obvious that most movie goers can't make this distinction.The main reason that I like this film is because of the way they designed the Mummy (Imhotep). Excellent casting there. He was menacing and he was powerful. His character carries this movie.Unfortunately, there is just way too much comedy in this flick. It detracts from any suspense or awe. It's hard to get caught up in a movie when the main characters are constantly saying and doing STUPID things.Like I said, it's a good movie. But don't expect Ben Hur."
1,Belongs on MST3K,"This was possibly the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Very few films manage to get everything wrong, but this one did. Expect a weak plot and a poor computer generated setting laced with general inaccuracies. There are a few moments of good acting with some characters, but they are canceled out by the horrible 'acting' of characters such as the mummy, which stares at a character for ten seconds, then growls."
1,No Dolby Digital 5.1!,"If you don't have a DTS decoder on your receiver, then don't even bother. The 5.1 audio on this disc is DTS ONLY, with the only Dolby audio being a lousy Dolby Pro-Logic 2.0 mix. Hardly the ""Purest Digital Sound Available"" that it falsely claims on the back of the box. Yeah...""purest"" IF you have DTS equipment. Had I known this beforehand I wouldn't have bought it. Of course, who would even think to check since just about every DVD ever made has had a 5.1 channel. What is especially insulting is that the main menu audio is in 5.1. It would have been nice to have a warning or disclaimer on the box. What's the point of a hi-def format when muddy, bogus 2-channel audio is all that's available for someone with a Dolby Digital setup? Especially since its available on the standard (and supposedly inferior?) DVD release? Do they want us to buy a new $300 receiver just to play one movie? What a joke. If you only have a Dolby setup, avoid this release."
1,Suckfest 2000,"Is this what movies are coming to? I learned nothing aboutancient times, or the characters, or even about kung fu! This movieis MTV blurspeed editing that adds nothing to the viewing experience but a headache. This was nonstop movement, NOT action. Add to this visual noise an over the top sountrack that tells us morons stupid enough to watch this ... how we're supposed to feel. I couldn't wait for the music to let me know the climactic ending was coming -- dunt dunt Tah DAHHHHH. But wait, that climax was just a teaser, now there's another, Tahhh DAAHHHHH, and another and another and another... I thought it would never end. So what's the plot? Who knows? I wasn't supposed to wonder about that as I was getting clubbed over the head with the BIGGEST and MOST action (movement)the ancient world has ever known!"
1,Another film made for a reason I can't see,"The gets thrown into the mix with films like ""Fight Club"" and such. Obviously, the makers already new that it wouldn't be hit. With the Mummy, casting Fraiser was a bad idea. Everyone is used to seeing him as a dopey yet cute character in movies like ""George of the Jungle"" and ""Blast From the Past"". I think after the making the total flop ""Dudley Do-Right"", Fraiser wanted to play a different kind of character. Well too late, cause everyone is used to the regular kinds of characters he plays. I was not very impressed because of this fact."
2,I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be a comedy or a horror,"Visual effects aside, this movie was really quite dumb. My eleven year old twins enjoyed it and that was about the intellectual level the film. It seemed like Brendan Frazier wasn't quite sure if the film should be a comedy or a horror show. It seemed as though he wasn't quite sure how to act, funny or scared. It was quite violent at times and too many people died. I would not rent it again. If it wasn't for the visual effects--I would have rated the film 1 star."
3,"adventure, funny,action......you got it all in one","What can i tell you....it is funny, i mean the movie, but honestly, i wouldn`t know where to put the whole thing....Did ""Indiana Jones"" ring a bell to the producer of this movie? However, it seems to me like the producer (or director)couldn`t make up his mind: when is about to became funny, the action kicks in...when the horror part is about to start, it becames funny... Generally, the movie is good, entertaining and the special FX keeps you up. And not only the visual once....if you own a surround sound system, then you know what i am talking about. You may wanna watch it 1st and then decide if you wanna add this movie to your collection.I`ll give it a 3 out of 5"
5,"Great, thrilling and clever","The Mummy never relented in its excitement and thrill, and the plot was incredibly clever. It is the best movie I have seen for a long time. It was always exciting. In one word, 'Awesome!!!'"
4,This was a pretty good movie!,"I really liked this movie! It was absolutely filled to the brim with adventure for you adventure-lovers out there. When i saw it the the theatre I jumped out of my seat a few times, but that's part of the fun, right? The good thing was that I went with my friend who had already seen it. She squeezed tight on my hand when a scary or surprising part was coming up! If you like adventure or kind of freaky films than I would recommend you see The Mummy. You'll probably like it."
1,WARNING! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PIECE OF C*&P!,"This movie is terrible in every way. Dont let the flashy special fx fool you! How people can enjoy bad acting, patheticly thin plots and bad artistic direction is beyond me. Do yourself a favor, STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE."
1,Beware!!! No Movie Cash- buy elsewhere.,"Unlike every other retailer, Amazon's Universal DVD's do NOT include the $7.50 in movie cash, and you will not find out until you open it. Thus you can't return it. Don't buy from Amazon, go to Sams- $19.23 or Circuit City or Best Buy."
2,it's not scary as you thought,"this is so called the new remake of the older Mummy Films.The acting is really bad, cause the director concentrated most only in the special effects.The one truth Mummy movie is ""THE MUMMY 1932 with Boris Karloff as Imhotep""."
1,The Mummy-DVD,"I haven't received the item above, yet have had two emails to review it. If you've sent it, please verify that it has really gone out. If not, please don't send me another email. Thanks."
1,How *BAD* can a film get!,"Thie is definitely one of the worst pieces of cinematic trash that it has ever been my misfor- tune to see,"
2,Tired of Blockbuster Movies,"This movie is a tipical teenager blockbuster: lots of special effects, preatty actors, advanture and comedy all mixed together and cliches, cliches and CLICHES. I get out of my mind when people compare this movie with Indiana Jones. Please! Indiana Jones was original, charming, inteligent, very good acted and, well, let's see... it has a PLOT! Well, I have to say one thing: The Mummy indeed has not a single quality Indiana has ."
4,It was good,"It was pretty scarey. And funny. Kept me on the edge of my seat. Good graphics. Brandin was the best actor for the film. (As also in Geroge of the Jungle). If you are looking for a good horror, and action with good actors. And cool music. The Mummy is it."
2,Indiana Jones Revisited,"I agree with the other gentleman about this being nothing more than a way of doing Indiana Jones all over again. You can see it all over the movie, #1 and #2. Special Effects were very good, but the rest was like watching Harrison Ford again."
3,Mummy & Mummy Returns Bundle?,"Well... Like all other 583 reviews say... It's an OK movie, good effects, acting was so-so... And if you get the Mummy on DVD, you might as well get the ""Ultimate"" edition! What's next? The ""Super-dee-duper-Ultimate-Outta-Sight"" Edition??? Why buy now, when in about 6 months, they'll have this one bundled with the 'Mummy Returns' DVD... <sigh> This DVD Edition stuff is just going way bananas..."
3,Minimum System Requirements for DVD-ROM content,"Disc 2 contains DVD-ROM content, though they do not tell you the system requirements on the box, the insert or the disc label. But for you Mummy fans thinking of picking this up, Windows 95 is the minimum stated on the intro screen once you get far enough."
4,Mummy's the Word,"The Special Effects are weak by today's standards, but not particularly bad. This is because they never let the fact that they can do fantastic things in CG distract them from crafting a fun action story with likable characters. The effects are sufficient for their purpose and do not distract.That being said, the real draw here is the character of the movie. Not the characters on their own, though they are fun too. But the character of the movie. It aims to be a fun action adventure and it achieves that very nicely. There are a couple bits (primarily around a couple of the victims of the mummy's attacks and regeneration) that can be a bit disturbing to the very young, so just know that it earns its PG-13 rating. But beyond that, there is very little here that is particularly objectionable.A fun ride that leaves you feeling good at the end."
5,"even without the Rock, this still has action","this movie was before the WWE star Rocky Johnson started acting. in the movie, Imhotep gets resurrected with one problem: a fear of cats. Beni turns weasel and starts helping Imhotep. he comes back to life and develops a crush on Evylyn, played by Rachel Weisz. this movie has plenty of action and bugs and would give anyone the creeps if they're not accustomed to it."
5,Wow,I firmly believe that this movie is a great movie for all adventure movie fans. It brings in history with fantasy and romance all in one. It is a great movie for any moviegoer!
3,Rather stupid humor,"The visual effects were pretty cool, but the actors were stupid and their humor was stupid. 3 stars."
5,Great Special effects,This is one of the best movies made. The story line matches the orginal movie exactly. The special effects are the best I've seen lately. That has nothing to do with space movies. What a nice change.
4,this video is full of adventure,this video is full of action packed adventure. Nothing will get you out of your seat for this.Brendon Fraiser is the best and cutest guy to have played int his movie.
3,"A really funny movie, not the least bit scary","This movie is a great movie for the kids to watch. It seems to be more funny then scary. Brendan Frasier is probably the best guy for the movie. He sense of humor and great acting, make this a great movie. If I was to recommend this movie for you to watch, I would say just watch it in the theatre. Where it costs very little. That would be better then owning that movie at such a high price. This is a great comedy, rather then a action filled thriller. Don't buy it, it's not worth the time and money."
4,Scary but really GOOD (9-year old's review),"The Mummy is in my opinion a very well written movie. For kids just going into PG-13 movies it might be a little scary, but for kids who have already seen PG-13 movies it is a very interesting movie and if you like violence and Egyptian mummies then this is the movie for you. I myself haven't seen The Mummy Returns but I can't wait."
3,A few handsome young people and great special effects....,"Since this is a re-make, I assume that the story/plot was always this lame. BUT, there are some really entertaining special effects, though, not completely believable as most of the recent computer generated stuff.There is kinda of a touching romance between the lovely young British girl and Brendan Fraser's character. However, the more enjoyable charasters were young lady's brother and a shady ""Eastern"" man, who was looking for some wealth and adventure on somebody else's expense.The story of the Mummy itself and of some strange men in black, calling themselves Mummy guardians or something like that, is completely preposterous.But, hey, there are three good looking men [Fraser, the Mummy, and that Israeli actor, who plays ""the man is black""] in the film, so I am quite content just watching them do some pretty stupid things and say some stupid lines..."
4,Citizen Kane it isn't,"but it doesn't try to be. A very entertaining movie, nice performance from Fraser. Sure, there are some flaws, cliches and whatnot, but it's still a good action-adventure, chock full of special effects.Some very interesting DVD features as well. Documentaries of the special effects, and an Egyptology refresher 'course.'"
4,A good remake,"Filled with dazzling special effects and a new storyline, Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz star in The Mummy. A 3,000 year old legacy of terror has just been unearthed deep in the Egyptian desert. Based on Universal's legendary 1932 horror classic, this nonstop action epic dazzles with state-of-the-art visual effects, top-notch talent and superb storytelling, that tops its sequel."
4,ok ok ok,"yea ok, the acting was subpar the special effect kind of chessy, and like an Indian Jones movie, but who could look away with Brendan Fraser, Arnold Vosloo and Oded Fehr filling the screen????I watch a movie to turn my brain off and to relax. I don't want to be thinking about difficult plots and complex characters. I know that sounds childish, but movies are for ENTERTAINMENT.It did keep my interest, had some funny parts and some that not scared, but surprised.So, if you have some down time and need to look at some pretty faces and bods, take load off and sit back and relax."
4,Not Great - Just Fun,"This movie was just what it was supposed to be - fun to watch. Lean on plot, cornball acting (though well done), and all, it's a fun action flick and was no doubt made to be just that. Those with too sophisticated a taste need not watch. Children of all ages are welcome."
5,Truly brilliant,"Now I've always enjoyed Egyptology, pharoahs and mummies, so going to see this movie in 1999 didn't seem as far fetched as some may think. Boy, did it please! This film is by far one of the most incredible movie-going experiences ever. I don't agree that the acting was often unbelievable; it's an action-comedy, like Indiana Jones, and so the actors comes off more comedic than serious because that is the effect the filmmakers were going for, I can honestly say that I didn't sleep for days after I saw The Mummy because it scared me so much. The Mummy is as delectable as it was the day it came out and one of the Top 10 action-comedies of all time. Brilliant, period."
2,Make Your Night A Blockbuster Night,This movie would have been good if they didn't add comedy in suspenseful parts. DON'T BUY THIS. RENT IT! BLOCKBUSTER IS GOOD.
4,Fun movie - poor quality control,A fun movie. Good special effects and a story. Wow! But at 1 hr and 40 minutes into the movie the soundtrack stopped. No more music or dialogue.
2,brenda ain't no indiana jones,this is a boring atempt to make an indiana jones movie it fails at trying to make classic one liners and brendon fraiser aint no indiana jones.......
1,Nice Cartoon,"This would've made a nice cartoon. As a movie--nuh uh.Too hokey the way they did it. WAAAAAAYYYYY too hokey.Oh, and the 25 year old Playboyesque hottie as the ""archaeologist""---oh yeah, that's believable. Like I said, it's a cartoon. Not a movie."
2,Disappointing.,"The effects here are sometimes fantastic, though hardly crisp. The dialogue is wretched, and the acting only slightly better. Somehow, it's still almost mildly entertaining - though probably best saved for the Fraser diehards."
1,"In short, it's special effects trash, nothing more.","I was unlucky enough to have seen this movie in the theaters. I should've waited for it to come out on video. NO! I should've waited for it to premiere on network TV had I known it was going to be this bad. ""The Mummy"" is basically an exercise in special effects, and nothing more. At least they could've included something of a plot, but it was nowhere to be found. People said I should see it merely for the effects, although after seeing it, I didn't think they were any better than ""The Matrix"". I don't care for the acting, either. It's an example of what poor casting can do to a film. Now for my attack on the MPAA, I felt that the level of violence in this film was too much for a PG-13 rating. If you disagree with me, then take a close look at the R rated film ""The Matrix"" and decide for yourself which is worse."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,IF I HAD KNOWN WHAT I SAW ON THIS MOVIE I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT. IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THE OLDER MOVIES OF THE MUMMY THAT HELD YOUR INTERST. THIS MOVIE WAS ENTIRELY TOO DULL.
5,I LOVE EVELYN,Rachel Wesiz stars in this action packed thriller see it today. The only thing good about Anck Su Namun is that she takes her clothes off.
3,Too Little of a plot,"""The Mummy"" is a disappointing waste of time. I was hoping that it would be like Indiana Jones, but it was not at all. There was so little plot, that after it was over, I felt like I had just sort of stared at a screen for a couple of hours. Granted, the special effects were spectacular, but they could never make up for the poor dialogue. It also felt very hard to connect with the characters, and therefor hard to root for them. All in all, ""The Mummy"" is an entirely avoidable movie."
4,Pretty Good,Good Movie. Good effects and all that but the plot overall was pretty stupid. A bit childish.
1,Long and Boring,"I watched this movie in the theater, and fell asleep. I thought Id give it a second chance, so I rented it. I fell asleep again. Not only does this movie seem to drag on forever, the acting is horrible and the plot and characters are dumb. Thats the best word to describe this movie. Dumb."
2,"Great Effects, Good Storyline, Bad Casting","Brendan Fraser was the wrong person for the leading role in this movie, he made this movie hokey/cheesy."
2,WHY NOT WIDESCREEN & FULL FRAME ON SAME DISC?,"Hey Universal (and other studios), why not put both widescreen & full frame on the DVD like they began doing. I just bought the DVD and it turned out to be the less desired butchered full frame, so I will return it. Why confuse everyone rather than educate those with the better widescreen version showing everything."
5,Great acting and action. It was great special effects.,Some may say it was predictable and it was in parts but you actually got a few surprises. It was fun to watch and a movie that I can see over and over. The development of the characters was great.
4,Adventurous and funny.,"This movie is a perfect example of a summer movie. It had action, suspense, drama, and comedy. The pairing of Raechel Weisz and Brendan Fraser was far fetched, but overall, it was great."
4,WOW!,"This incarnation of The Mummy kicks @#*! Universal has successfully recreated the feel and spirit of the Indiana Jones trilogy and the result is at least as good as Temple of Doom. This movie is as fast paced as it gets, it is filled with suspense, humor and eye-popping special effects. This movie is 100% fun, and if you already cherish the Indiana Jones triology in your home video collection then put this in your shopping cart because your collection won't be complete without it. The icing on the cake: this appears to be a terrific special edition DVD. Deleted scenes, commentaries... I can't wait to plop my hard earned money down for this one! As a foot note, this goes to show how expectations play in how much you enjoy a movie. I saw this movie expecting another Godzilla (yeach!) and I was blown away with how good it was. I went to see The Phantom Menace expecting to be blown away and came away dissappointed by what was on second viewing a good movie."
3,"Good, but...","The movie looks great. However, there are a couple of curious and annoying issues.1. The PS3 had an update a few months ago which gave the machine the capability of ""remembering"" where the viewer left off (stopping the disc or even removing it). Upon restarting the disc, it would pick up at that point. This disc does not respond to that useful feature. You have to noodle your way through the film to find where you left off.2. Sometimes I like to freeze the frame and enjoy a moment in the cinematography, or perhaps play a portion in slo-mo. This disc has a pop-up ""slider bar"" which shows you where you are in the time line of the film. This thing appears whenever you activate Pause, etc. The feature seems to be unavoidable and I find it quite annoying. This a case where, IMHO, the Blu-ray ""bells and whistles"" are out of control."
4,Great movie in HD,This was a great movie in HD. Made it seem like I was watching it again for the firt time.
3,Be Aware...,"I haven't yet been able to view what is supposed to be a beautiful transfer onto blu-ray. This release by Universal will not currently play on Samsung players (I have tested four different Samsung players; it plays fine on other manufacturers' decks), beyond the FBI warning, opinion disavowal, film rating, and opening menu. Instead it locks in a ""Slide Show"" mode with a dark screen which is not responsive to your remote. There is a recent firmware update from Samsung dated 6/20, which may resolve this problem."
2,Terribly Overrated,"For the life of me, I will never understand the craze about this film. The acting ranged from terrible to 2nd rate, the special effects were too heavy, character development was virtually nonexistent. For a film that has been called the next Indiana Jones, everything in this film is lesser than Speilberg's and Lucas' superb adventure trilogy. I mean, what the heck was up with this film anyway? Brendan Fraser's trying to be an action hero, but also a comedian, just did not work as he never neared achieving either goal. The deaths of several of the good characters had no effect, as we never really got to know them. Not once DURING THE ENTIRE MOVIE was I on the edge of my seat, though it was all I could do to not lean comfortably back and fall asleep in it. Okay, perhaps that's an overstatement and a bit harsh, but this film is not as good as the critics say!"
4,AWESOME FX!!!,"Horror,action,comedy.This movie has it all.The FX are awesome,but the acting leaves something to be desired.The story line is easy to follow,but a little predictable.Action like Indiana Jones.All in all it's a great movie."
2,Over-digitized Hollywood junk,"This is another example of how Hollywood is using cheesy computer-generated special effects to substitute for plot. This movie is pure junk. The acting is abominable and the story line is stupid. Brandon Fraser looks good though. If you see it, see it just for him."
5,This film is the ultimate in entertainment,"if your going to buy a dvd movie this month and you have Matrix already , buy this film it rocks, from start to finish it is a blockbuster of the huge kind"
2,Thank goodness for DVD frame advance feature,"I really did not care for this movie at all. The special effects are very impressive but it stops there. I found myself using the fast frame advance a lot in this movie and it was the first time I have ever seen it. Pointless dialog and dumb jokes interupted some decent action scenes and had no effect on the movie. I even think the Mummy himself was a little whimpy. Yeah he can make neat faces in the sand and he killed a few people but he never really kicked any butt. Maybe I am just compairing it to the Matrix. Glad I rented it. As far as the DVD I liked all of the extra's it had on it. It is always fun to ""explore"" a new DVD."
4,Thee funniest movie on Mummy's & has great special effects!!,"This movie is not original. It's the basic save the world type movie, but what makes it so good is the special effects done with the mummy and numerous others. It's got it's funny parts played mostly by Rick and others. This movie also contain true facts about Egyptian life and afterlife. I personaly like the special effects and the comedy."
5,"Great Effects,Great Movie","Great effects,good acting,and interesting plot combine to make this one heckuva good movie,well worth the money."
4,Big Fun,"OK, maybe it is the teeniest bit hokey, but still fine entertainment in the final analysis. One thing I noticed is that there isn't a single ""cuss word"" uttered throughout the entire two hours -- unusual in today's films. The story line is something of a stretch, but the heroine is brave and beautiful, the villains are wonderfully evil, and Brendan Fraser is, well, Brendan Fraser! More of an Action/Adventure flick than a horror movie, it follows in the tradition of the Indiana Jones series and ""Jewel of the Nile"". Great special effects may be too intense for kids under 10, but otherwise fun for the whole family."
2,This DVD played on a computer forces you to download softwar,"If you plan to view this DVD on your computer, be aware that you will be required to install PC Friendly software before you can view the film. This software contains, screen savers, postcards, games etc. so if that interests you then it is probably great for you. I for one resented being forced to do this since all I wanted was to add the movie to my collection of DVD's."
5,The reviewers don't get the joke!,"I saw this movie twice: once in the theatre, and once on video. The first time, I thought the movie was dumb, with a bad script, and bad acting. The second time, I realized that it's SUPPOSED to be that way. The movie is a joke. If you realize that, you'll like the movie. It's a great laugh!"
5,Great adventure,"A wonderful action, adventure movie with great actors and wonderful computer generated visuals. Great fun."
3,The One Thing you MUST remember,"is that other than the basic plot and the clever use of a couple names, this cannot, in any way, be considered a remake of the original Karloff masterpiece. It just cannot even begin to compare, because it's essentially a different film. Part melodrama, part comedy, part horror and part Indiana Jones, the mummy is a super-enjoyable film with an appropos cast, lots of action and a great deal of serial-type last-minutes. It's great fun to watch, and more than once. The special effects are excellent, the photography cool, and the script fairly snappy, with the occasional small step into corn and/or plot hole. Every actor fits their part extremely well, and the whole thing only slows down a tiny bit here and there. For the most part, it just keeps on moving. The extras are plentiful, but not all of them are great. The documentary goes on a bit too long, and the deleted scenes are too short. The rest depends on yur individual taste."
3,a lopsidED REVIEW,"On some points this ain't that bad, but on some points it stinks. Let's go through the pros first.Pros:Good Special EffectsBrendan Fraser Is Not That Bad Of A ActorGood For Non-Thinking Days (For Me, That Doesn't Happen That Often)Cons:Lousy Story LineLousy ScriptYes it is true, a bad script makes a bad movie. But this movie is not bad, just could have been WAY better. I think this is not on the top of my to buy list. Rent it, but buy the original first."
3,These reviews belong to TREMORS not THE MUMMY,"The reviews presented on this page are for the movie Tremors which does have Bacon in it, not The Mummy. lol"
5,"You must get this it's brilliant, you'll love it(probably)","I went to watch the Mummy at the cinema 4 times and it is just brilliant. The special effects are unbelievable, much better than Phantom Menace and the Story is good too. It is exciting all of the way through and will keep you on the edge of your seat. I don't know how it got away with a 12 rating it should be higher but it is pure brilliance. This could possibly be my favourite film ever. It is excellent. But it doesn't suit everybody, but won me over and should you too. 98 out of 100."
3,Great Fun to Watch!,"This is such a campy film, but it was loads of fun. Special effects were better than average, but the story can have added some more depth to the Ancient Egyptian lovers."
4,What a fun movie!,"A handsome hero, a heroine who's smart and adventurous, a creepy, gooey monster, a few yuks, and some cool special effects. I loved it! The comedy inserted throughout complimented the horror nicely and took the edge off...especially for squeamish viewers. This was definitely my favorite summer movie and the video is on my Christmas list."
3,good for superficial easy-to-forget adventure fans,"I expect a combination of good special effects, good drama and good acting. All I get is good effects, not quite as good as Spielberg's but good for nowadays techno. The rest is a standard good- versus-evil predictable stuff without any compelling scenes or touching acting besides some cheap humors and non-touching human killing binges."
4,Started Summer Movie Season With A Bang!,"Didn't think there would be any other movie I would want to see as bad as ""Star Wars"" but I stand corrected. Sure the visual effects were amazing but the the story itself was exciting, scary and very funny. I think everyone worked well together and every character was important to the plot. Sometimes that's not an easy thing to do and I thank the person who revised the original for doing a great job. I think it was the best action movie of the summer next to ""Star Wars"". Keep up the good work!!"
4,Great historically based fantasy,Excellent action/fantasy storyline based on historical characters. Quality SFX. Good acting & directing.The additional CD has a lot of interesting stuff about Egyptian history aswell as the movie extras.
3,"Really, really corny - but fun","This is one of the cornist, most hackneyed movies you will ever see. The jokes are miserably obvious and the director follows the truly annoying tactic of having the actors move in unison when grouped together. In addition to that, the plot besmirches one of the most revered figures in history - Imhotep, recorded history's first multi-disciplinary genius.All that having been said, the subject matter is interesting enough that one can actually have some fun watching it. Rachel Weisz's spritely performance has a lot to do with that, though. Without her, this movie would be DOA."
4,"A wonderful movie, despite a few faults","""The Mummy"" is a wonderful, suspenseful, adventurous, and romantic movie. It also turned the spark of interest I had in ancient Egypt into a full blown bonfire. Not to mention the movie is packed with gorgeous and fairly talented actors--such as Arnold Vosloo (who portrays Imhotep very well despite not speaking a word of English...or any other modern tongue...throughout the entire movie.), Oded Fehr, Brendan Fraser, and Patricia Velasquez (whose role was minor yet integral to the film).However, they could have spent less money on special effects and more on historical accuracy. There are several historical goofs...both subtle and glaring. I was a little put off when, after a lovely shot of the Giza Pyramids, a baritone-voiced narrator said that it was ""Thebes.""Other than that, I did enjoy it, and I recommend it to everyone.One more thing: It's not often that a story makes you want to root for the ""bad guy"". This one will...trust me! ;-)"
2,YEEEEEE awn,"Brenda Fraser, please go away! I cannot say this movie was mummy-rific or mummy-tastic, borrowing clever adjectives from some of the other reviewers. What I can say is that I am glad my roommate paid for the rental on this one.The dialogue was canned and the story was absolutely formulaic, to the point where even moderately initiated moviegoers could see the whole plot unfold in the first ten minutes of the ""film.""Actual sample dialogue: ""we're in big trouble."" Followed by the Mummy growling even louder and then, ""We're in REALLY big trouble.""hmm... riveting..The special effects were good, and earn it two stars, but ultimately we are left with a typical polished hollywood beauty and no personality."
4,A pleasant surprise,"We were standing in the video aisle at the grocery store. It was 7:45 PM on a Friday night. All the new releases were checked out. My 12-year old and 9-year old were debating the merits of viewing The Nutty Professor for the umpteenth time.Then we saw the DVD version of The Mummy. Very low expectations and lack of anything better led us to rent the DVD.WHAT A SURPRISE! This movie reminded me of an old-time Saturday matinee flick. Just gross enough without being gory. Just enough funny and in-cheek humor that didn't descend into 3 Stooges.The most telling sign was in the 'Making of the Mummy"" featurette. All the memebers of the production team spoke about how they didn't want to make the effects too gory. Wow! Thinking of the probable adolescent audience! What a concept.Universal Films should be commended for such a fun movie."
2,nice but nothing to get excited about,"well, it is a kind of fun movie, i even bought the dvd and now i am looking for somebody dumb enough to buy it from me. sorry, but i can not understand what folks like about hollywood mass products, full of stupid action, stupid dialogues, and stupid plots, like a jump and run adventure game - a very easy way to spend your way after your successful lobotomy, but no real value. there is just no touch, no really interesting or dramatic moment where the movie gets a hold of you and just knocks you off your feet. please do not buy. watch, if thou wilt, but don't thou buy this piece of brainlessness."
4,mummy returns is a little better!!!!,"ok i dont want to put the mummy down, so i gave it a four. dont get me wrong it was a great movie but the sequel to it, the mummy returns, was a whole lot better, but imhotep(arnold vosloo) looked just as hot!!!!"
3,Below Par Story Line,"This DVD is a mixed bag. On the plus side, the disc has many extra features thrown in. I think that DVD's should have the extra features because of the added cost over VHS-it gives the customer an incentive to buy. I especially enjoyed the documentary on ILM who did the effects for the film which are great.On the down side, the plot line was quite shallow and really lacking. After a while I felt that the effects had taken center stage and the story was secondary. If you want a disc with good audio and video to show your friends what the format is capable of, then buy this. Otherwise get the Boris Karloff version."
4,INDIANA JONES AND THE THREE STOOGES,"THE SPECIAL EFFECTS OF THIS MOVIE ARE TRULY SPECTACULAR. IF ANCIENT EGYPT WAS EVEN HALF AS GLORIOUS I WAS BORN IN THE WRONG TIME. RACHEL WEISE IS ADORABLE AS THE GENIUS DITZ OF THE DESERT, I'D KISS A CAMEL FOR HER. I THOUGHT BRENDAN FRAISER WAS GREAT. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS FILM."
5,YEAH!,"When I first saw The Mummy, I was so impressed that the film makers kept the original story line and characters. This version mixes horror, romance, and cartoonish type fighting in this wonderful movie. When this Ultimate Edition came out I knew I had to snatch it up. Believe me, THIS IS WORTH BUYING! So if you liked this movie, BUY IT!"
4,"Reminds me of ""Raiders""","I found the 1999 movie ""The Mummy"" to be a suprise. The suprise was how enjoyable it was as a movie-going experience. These days, the movie-going experience leaves much to be desired, with most movies way overblown(""Phantom Menace""!) or just plain stupid(""Phantom Menace"") I single out the latest ""Star Wars"" movie because that was the film I saw just before seeing ""The Mummy"". I can honestly say ""The Mummy"" was hundreds of times better. It has action, witty characters, and a plot that can be easily understood and enjoyed. In this way, it reminded me of perhaps the greatest adventure movie of my era, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". I'm not saying I need all my movies to be so simple in their design, but now and again, it is essential for our ""swashbuckler"" side to enjoy a fun adventure. ""The Mummy"" is that and them some. Check this one out!"
3,"So much, yet so little...","The effects were INCREDIBLE, the cast was great. But the story totally blew, it was like a badly written ""indiana Jones"". Not a bad movie to watch though."
1,Racist Propaganda- I want to put zero stars.,"The real life Imhotep was a master architect, the real father of medicine, and a high priest. How dare you give his name to this character, an adultorus muumy. How would you like it if Ben Franklin, Thomas Edison, and Albert Einstein were put in such degenerate light? The movie may be funny but is not a comedy, therefore the intention was to smear the name of Imhotep. This makers of this movie should be tried and convicted for psychological warfare."
2,"Silly, silly film","This movie was a fleeting diversion, nothing more. And that's about the only positive thing I can say about it. The story took forever to get started and wasn't even worth waiting for and the characters were insufferable, especially that annoying guy who was in ""Deep Rising"" and the brother of that Frasier's love interest. The movie would've been better if the Mummy had offed him. The special effects are decent, I suppose but they're not enough to make me want to watch this turkey again."
1,Incompatible with Some Blu-Ray Players,"This dvd does not play on my Pioneer Elite BDP-95FD. The machine loads the menus but none of the movie will play. The player has up-to-date firmware and is less than a year old.Might be a great transfer but more care should have been put into seeing that the DVD functioned on all blu-ray players or a warning should have been given about what was needed.Based on other reviews, this problem does not appear to be limited to Pioneer machines."
1,Another worthless Remake,"Hollywood must think that fans of Horrormovies are Braindead,otherwise they would have choosen to use either the version proposed by Clive Barker or Joe Dante for the Remake of ""The Mummy""Instead a mediocre script was choosen,and a less then mediocre actor,Brendan Fraser(George of the Jungle) was hired for the lead role and to top it all of,very bad CGI(Cheap Gimmicky Images? )where used in this worthless Remake! But I guess that's all that is needed to have a Summer Blockbuster?"
2,"Fun SFX, but paper thin","Although this movie is a fun ride with tongue-in-cheek dialogue, it didn't bother to get anything about ancient Egypt right. Considering it wouldn't have been that hard to get at least a few details correct, this lack of ANY historic accuracy ruined the movie for me. By the time the characters started talking about ""five canopic jars,"" I couldn't stand it anymore, I had to turn to my date to say ""FOUR canopic jars!"" And, what's ""mummifying people alive?"" Since step 1 of mummification is draining the body of blood, you wouldn't actually live through more than a few minutes of the process. The complete ignorance of Egypt, obstensibly the setting and motivation for the entire film, is extremely grating and offensive. Cute dialogue is nice, cool SFX is nice, but they aren't enough to get me to watch this one twice."
3,Not a bad movie.,"The Mummy wasn't the most involving movie that I've ever seen, but it still wasn't bad. It reminded me quite a bit of other films I've seen, particularly the movies dealing with Indiana Jones. The Mummy no doubt had a lot of money put into it; the cinematography and special effects were better-than-average. The plot didn't quite grab me, but it was still okay though. The acting was good and the leading lady was very beautiful. The Mummy wasn't a film that striked me as very original, but it still was pretty good and worth a watch."
1,The Mummy review.,"I wanted to order the physical DVD sent to me and I went into the wrong place. I did not want the video showing on my computer. Therefore, I deleted it right away."
3,Not For Egyptologists...,"...but everyone else should enjoy it. Okay, here's my problem.Great special effects, great chemistry between the two leads, lots of action, and lots of humor. So far, so good. But the opening scene takes place in ancient Thebes,and there's a Pyramid and the Sphinx. Perhaps I'm being a little nitpicky, but hello?!? The Pyramids and the Sphinx are in Giza. Then later,Evelyn is talking about the process of mummification, and she says ""...and then they take out your heart."" (which they would leave in). And there were five canopic jars when there should have been four. The list goes on. All these gaffes could be excused if the director didn't know any better, but from what I've read,he consulted with an Egyptologist for the film.I really enjoyed this movie when it first came out,but know I can't even watch it. What a bummer."
2,Poor Transfer,"I just watched my Blu-Ray version of The Mummy and was very disappointed. The definition was almost indistinguishable from the DVD! If you're looking for eye-popping high resolution, this movie doesn't deliver. It looks like standard definition. Don't believe me? Try it yourself. Bummer."
2,Indiana Jones?,"It wasn't horrible but I found myself dosing off in the theater while watching it.It reminds me of what an Indiana Jones movie would be like if Steven Spielberg wasn't involved in the production! I didn't care for the computer generated appearance of the mummy either. To sum it up,it's a movie that's designed to be ""fun"" not scary and often gets boring."
2,Indiana Jones Meets the Mummy,Boooooo!!! The best part of this movie was (of course) the visual effects.. If only they could find actors who could act and not shoot everything that moved! I'd recommend the origional 'Mummy'---MUCH more thrilling...
4,A great remake of a classic...,Though light on the horror. It had more of a gross angle to it than any horror. It's a great action adventure at least.
1,The won't work,I got this about a month ago and also had bought The Mummy Returns. I just got a HD DVD player in Feb. and it won't play on it or any other I have in the house. They had a piece of paper that came in the movie case and said that you machine may need to be updated. I went to the website and all they have is an announcement saying that they aren't making HD-DVD players anymore.
3,It gets better with every viewing.,"When I first saw ""The Mummy"" last year I wasn't impressed. I thought it was a campy ""Indiana Jones"" ripoff. However, due to the fact that everyone I know loves this movie, I have been since forced to view the film again several times. As it turns out, ""The Mummy"" isn't all that bad, in fact it's pretty good fun.The film has good effects, music and the cast have a special chemistry that is important to movies like this. If you see it and don't like it at first, try it again a month or so later and you might be suprised when you find yourself with a goofy smile on your face."
2,Great special effects. . . . . horrible cast,"I rented the Mummy hoping to see a serious movie with awesome special effects. What I got were great special effects, and a mismatched cast. Brendon Frazier (not sure of the spelling) was horrible in this movie. His comedic style completely ruined what could have been an awesome movie. I was expecting an ""Indiana Jones"" type movie, but what I got was Encino Man being chased by a mummy. I would encourage renting this movie for the special effects, but thats about it."
4,OLD FASHIONED FUN,"Though lacking the subtlety that made the original 1932 classic so great, this remake manages to combine the thrills of ""Indiana Jones"", the awe of a Ray Harryhausen stop motion flick and the spooky fun of Universal's 1940's ""B"" Mummy series. Brendan Fraser is very cheerful and likeable, and Rachel Weisz is pleasing to the eye, and a good actress to boot. The DVD picture and sound are first rate; the extras are almost as fun to watch as the movie."
5,mummy rules...,"I thought this movie was a big flopp...But I ended up seeing it three times on a movie screen...And paid good money for it too...It`s something new, and something good...Brendan Fraser is as sexy as always...and still makes a little girl in love smile...brendan...he he he..lots of love from Sissel in Norway...Yessss"
1,One of the worse and most dissapointing,"What you see is not what you get.!!!! You don't get the whole pack but only 1/5 of it which is 100, its a rip off. run for your soul while you can.!!!"
1,Made the same mistake.,I never ever thought that a book would be placed on Amazon.com and when not publihsed in English be made more emphatic. The book looks good but of course I can't read one word of it. I live in Australia so to send it back will put me out more than keeping it. Very frustrating but what can you do? Now I always check that the book I am purchasing is in English. By looking at the prior customers who had the same problem I don't feel as it I was the only one caught out with this book - Spanish who new?
3,Must Read Previous Title,"COLD FLAT JUNCTION by Martha Grimes is not a stand alone mystery, you must read the previous HOTEL PARADISE to have any inkling of what is happening in this story.Emma Graham is twelve years old and somewhere lost in her own fantasy world while she helps with the chores around the hotel and solves three murders on the side.All of Grimes children characters, even in the Jury novels are on the unbelievable side though she creates them in a lyrical style that is unequaled by another other writer.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS."
3,"a thin story, could have been told in half the pages","Martha Grimes returns to us her 12 year old narrator, Emma, and Emma's friend the Sheriff, along with a cast of characters at the old hotel where Emma's mother cooks. Over the nearly four hundred pages of the novel, Emma's company wears a little thin. She is a fully realized character, but with all the limitations of her age; her passionate likes and dislikes loom large in the story--and frankly, they are predictable to the point of being cliched. The mystery slowly, oh so slowly, unravels. This tale could have been told more cleanly and concisely in half the time. Martha Grimes is apparently very fond of her fictional creation, young Emma, but her adult readers may yearn for a return to a more mature narrator, or at least to a child who is more seasoned and prescient."
1,very disappointing,"Having grown the love the Richard Jury mysteries, I was bitterly disappointed by this novel. I tried to wade through it but it was so gawd-awful boring that I just gave up."
4,Wonder,"This is an wonderful book but the mystery is -confusing- and never ends. However, it's an wonderful story of trouble making, Emma, who make drinks to get infomation from the old lady, and she steals it from the snotty waitress' stash!Hilorous!"
2,"Say It Ain't So, Martha!",I will not be reading any more Emma Graham mysteries by Martha Grimes. I was very disappointed because the book did have the same quality writing as in ms. Grimes' Richard Jury novels. It would have been more generous to have described it as children's literature.
4,"Youth, love, adventure",Every once in a while a classic comes along that excites the imagination with a tale of adventure which leads to great understanding in the end. The Cossacks gives us a glimpse inside the Cossack world while helping us search for love and adventure through the travels of a young Russian soldier in the Caucuses. It is an adventure tale with all the color and swashbuckling a young man could desire but then adds the twist of romance to excite every imagination. The characters have depth and are brimming with cultural character. You too will fall in love on the great Cossack adventure of your life. Not a classic for nothing. Also a wonderful introduction to Tolstoi since the names are less unfamiliar than the names and places one is bombareded with in _War and Peace_. A great gift for anyone longing for adventure.
1,Disappointed in the packaging,"The book was wrapped with a thin bubble wrap and scotch tape, then covered with brown paper. The postman left it on the front porch in the rain and the book was ruined. I through it away."
4,Had to improve,"Kept looking for an oiled bronze version but this one works well. It had a problem with soap drawing back down after a day. But a check valveVernay Polycarbonate Supravalve (R) Check Valve for use with 1/8"" Tubing, 0-31 PSI, 212F Max TemporVernay Acrylic Supravalve (R) Check Valve for use with 1/8"" Tubing, 0-31 PSI, 140F Max Temp (Pack of 10)stuck in the clipped inlet tube makes for easily controllable flow that stays right up to the nozzle. Grohe should have used this instead of the simple ball check, just cheap/cheat."
4,2 out of 4 still working after 10 years,"I purchased 4 of these 10 years ago. They still look new, but 2 out of 4 don't pump anymore. I tried soaking with the nozzle upside down in warm water overnight in case Softsoap had hardened inside, but after several soakings, still won't work. Can't just buy the pump replacement. These last longer than those from Home Depot and look much better. In our house, 10 years+ is a good lifetime for a soap pump."
3,Grohe soap dispenser chokes on Softsoap,"As part of a remodeling, I put one each of these in our two bathrooms and two in the kitchen -- one for Softsoap for hands, another for dishwashing detergent. The Softsoap handsoap comes out smelling of metal, and if we have been away a few days, the soap is discolored as well. We tried Dial liquid soap for a while, but it performed even worse.If you know of a brand that might work better, please post.The dishwasher detergent performs just fine whether we use Palmolive or Dawn.I asked Grohe for advice on the hand soap, but they blew me off."
3,cute,"Looks nice, small gauge. Was a bit more difficult to insert than my original, due to tighter loop. I like the fact that the post is shorter, so less of it ""shows"" inside your nose. It has a snugger fit, stays in well."
2,not good,"I have had my nose pierced for years and I am pretty used to purchasing nose pins/rings like this but I have never been so dissapointed. Had I known that the quality of this piece of jewelry was going to be so low I would've saved my $10.99+expedited shipping, spend a little more and got a real nose pin. The last nose pin I had got old and was due for a replacement, I found this one and bought it but as soon as I got it I thought this must be a joke because it was by far the smallest nose ring I've seen (it wouldn't fit my sister who has a small nose).I have never been dissapointed by bodycandy before so don't let this review reflect your opinion of their company or service. I always receive my orders quickly and I have never been dissapointed with their jewelry before but this piece was laughable."
1,Bad,"Nose earring was too small to put in my nose, and as i was trying to put it in, the little rhinestone came out of the earring. I need to return."
3,left/right nostril (wrong nostril),"I wish I had checked the shape of my old nose screw because this one didn't fit me. :( Supposedly this jewelry corresponds to a left nostril piercing, but that is certainly not my experience. All the ""left nostril"" nose screws shown by Body Candy look like this item, but my own personal nose screw - that actually fits in my left nostril - looks like the ones they advertise as ""right nostril"" nose screws. I am perplexed!Aside from that, it is good quality but DOES look much smaller than its stated gauge. I got a s.steel nosering from the same company and it doesn't look as small, so maybe it's because it's gold. Not sure which nose screw to choose now..."
1,Not worth the cost.,"Bought 2 shirts $29.99 did not really think this through for the shipping charges $20 per shirt, 2 shirts came in one box(size of a medium pizza box).The company did offer to take the shipment back but, it was too late, I opened the shirts. After 2 washes, they are not holding up too well, so overall. I would not endorse this company or product.Amazon though, did acknowledge my issue with this shipping transaction as best they could. I hope they will improve for the next buyer."
4,Dress Shirt Review,Good quality fabric. Button-down collar stays neatly in place with the perfect allowance for the tie.
1,Needed an exterminator for all the BUGS!,"Slap my wrist for buying this game new. I should have waited 6 months. I couldn't find any support online for the bugs and when I finally got everything working, I forgot to turn my virus software off (plus you can't have a screensaver on either & you have to turn off background animations & shadows within the game) and it jacked up my computer BIG TIME. Wait awhile for them to fix this before buying it unless you like being ticked off."
2,I hade to quit playing....,"I was excited about this game coming out because I have played the others and enjoyed them a lot. However, this game had a lot of bugs, jerky movements and crashing....I only solved 2 of the cases and half way through the 3rd one and I stopped playing because of my frustration level.I guess it will have to sit on a shelf until Legacy figures out how to correct all the ""bugs."""
1,Too many bugs!,"Although I was able to play the first two games in the series without problems, and although I have updated drivers, and my computer meets all of the necessary requirements, I couldn't get past one minute of game play without the game freezing or shutting down. Way too many bugs and no support online. I would avoid this one."
1,Bugs and Frustration Await You,"I'd never played the Law & Order series games before this one, until then I had played only the CST series so that was all I had to compare it to. While Law & Order does a good job of trying to distinguish itself from CSI - one way it does this is by requiring the player to choose a ""tone"" in which to interview suspects (sympathetic, interogation, straightforward, etc.) thereby varying the level of information you get out of the suspects. Even this, however, becomes tiresome after a few suspects and a few questions.This game is so filled with bugs that it is too frustrating to even play. One bug is that when directing Detective Goren on where to walk, he often gets ""stuck"" and will jog in place or worse, jog into a wall repeatedly rather than go where you are directing him to go.All in all this game is too frustrating. Save your money."
1,Bugs destroy this game!!!,"I'll keep this short and sweet. Do not bother wasting money on this game. Bugs completely destroy the playability and enjoyment of this game, and the developer still has not addressed it! The game has been out for 4 months as I write this, and they still haven't taken any steps to fix it! Other reviewers say patience will get you past this. Baloney! Why would you play a game with huge glaring flaws? Supporting the developers of such games just encourages them to release shoddy flawed games before they're finished in order to cash in on them! Stand up for your rights and don't purchase this garbage!"
4,My Favorite Show,This wasn't as exciting as I had hoped but I did like it and still play.I would reccommend this game.Thanks
2,game issues,"Amazon was fast with sending my game to me. I love these games, but the game itself has many issues. The video is really bad. It's not my video card my husband has checked to make sure of that. I have just about every other Law and Order games and also CSI ones. They are the best."
3,Good game but bugs bugs bugs,"I was really looking foward to playing this game because I just love the show and already own the other law and order games. I dont regret buying this game but I really wish Legacy wouldn't have had so many bugs in it. It freezes up at times and I have had to reboot. Goren walks the wrong way other times and then just stays there walking till you reload your saved game. I wish he would have been a little more animated in this game also, as one person said, it sounds like he is bored with the whole thing and really didnt want to voice the game. I would recommend to wait, hopefully, till Legacy comes out with some patches before buying it because of the bugs. Otherwise, if you like the show, you'll like the game, just like I do. I would have given it a higher rating but the bugs really drag it down. Such a shame."
2,Crash-o-rama,"After 3 months I finally completed all four cases. I had to step awaaaaaay from the computer many many times to avoid throwing it out a window. I know, I know, don't kill the messenger. The game would be wonderful if not for the fact that it randomly CRASHES and every footstep has to be saved or potentially lost forever. Legacy sucked every ounce of fun out of the Law & Order series with this one, but my own sheer determination made me finish the cases. I hope they fix the problems with the next one. I think I'll read the reviews before buying it."
3,"Excellent game, too many glitches","I love this game. I love all crime-solving games. However, the bugs and glitches made it very frustrating to play.In between scenes, the screen would remain black for several minutes, although the audio worked just fine. If it hadn't been for the glitches, I would have given this game 5 stars.When I first bought this game, I thought I got a bad disk because everything kept freezing up. I replaced the disk with a new one, and the same thing happened. I wanted to play the game, so I dealt with the bugs.If you are patient and don't mind waiting for the screen to unfreeze, go for it. It's a great game, great plots, great concept.Legacy Interactive is horrible about the video quality of their PC games, it seems."
1,Please save yourself the aggravation!,"I am not new to adventure gaming and have a PC fully loaded and capable of handling EVERY other game I've tried. This one was so full of bugs that I snapped the CD in half out of sheer frustration. There are no patches available yet for the MULTITUDE of problems. Until there are, please don't waste your money!"
1,Huge disappointment,"I've played all of the CSI games and the three L&O games prior to this one and, man, was I let down by this. It's a huge resource hog - it took almost 10 minutes to install the thing and it took even longer to uninstall it. When the installation is complete it automatically sends a registration (to whom and with what information is unknown - a major privacy violation) without giving the opportunity to say no. The game play isn't intuitive at all and doesn't follow the same conventions established in the earlier offerings. The PDA thing is a pain in the [...], there's no right-click functionality, limited options in terms of configuration (cannot play it in other than full screen), and NO INSTRUCTIONS! Not happy at all with this."
2,Do not buy this game!! Too many bugs!,"I purchased this game recently, and I wish that I had read the reviews first... I have also experienced serious problems with the game. Many bugs... Several(10-15)minutes with a black screen between scenes! I wasted soooo much time attempting to play the game... and then it just completely crashed on me! I would have enjoyed this game if it were not for all the bugs! If it were not for all of the problems with this game, I'm sure that I would have solved all of the cases already... I preferred the CSI games that I purchased last year... and now I have pre-ordered the new CSI 3 game... I hope that there aren't any glitches or bugs like the new Law and Order- peice of crap. What a waste of money!"
2,"Game is good, TOO MANY BUGS","If you enjoyed the other L&O; games, you'll probably like this one too. However, this game has a lot of graphics problems and it's crashed on me twice. I have an nVIDIA GeForce 4 graphics card with 64MB memory, but the game still crashes on me even after I lower the graphics options. When I first got the game I had to call customer support (NOT TOLL FREE) and be on the line with them for over 30 minutes before they figured out that I need to download OLDER drivers for my graphics card.I got this game as soon as it came out becuase I loved the other L&O; games. If you can wait, give them time to fix the bugs and maybe release a patch or two. There isn't even an FAQ on their website for this game yet."
3,Great game...if you like bugs,"I think this game has the potential to be great. I like this style of game, and I usually have a great time trying to figure out the cases. This one seemed a bit easier than some of the other ones, and to be honest the extra features they are hyping so much don't really add to the game at all. I would recommend this game, after about 6 months. I would wait until they have patches available, because quite frankly it gets very irritating to have to stop and start so much because of the many many bugs. My game only crashed twice, which took forever to sort out, but the in-game bugs are horrible. They really really should've taken their time to release this, and I wonder if they even checked it out before they shipped it. I can't believe a manufacturer would ship a game so obviously bug filled."
1,There's a reason this movie is out of print,"This has to be one of the stupidest things I have ever seen. The plot makes little sense, the acting is terrible, and it tries to rip off aspects of real ""horror"" movies (such as Amityville Horror's ""Get Out"" and Halloween's music)."
1,A cursory review based on the sample download.,"I found the text to suffer from poor OCR conversion from the original work. To be of value, the author or publisher should proofread the book."
1,egregiously bad,"I agree with the previous reviewer; I 'bought' the full book (as it was free) and found it so full of garbled text & typographic garbage as to make it, for novices, worth its price: nothing."
1,unreadable...there's a much better edition,"yes, this edition is unreadable - BUT there's another, published by d k printworld, and also available on amazonthis is the best of the nineteenth century grammars (and is itself a re-writing of an earlier grammar) - though learning sanskrit needs a good teacher"
3,good but there's better,Decent collection. But nowhere as good as the incredibleCompact Jazz (Ella Fitzgerald/Louis Armstrong).They just don't seem quite as into it here.
2,cheap n nasty,"gold colour came off within 3 days, then silver colour in a couple more days which then left the copper. this then turned finger black all within a week.New Spiral Twister Magnetic Band Fits Ring Size 7 & up"
4,Wow!!,"I have had this ring for two days and cannot believe the difference! I am not constantly aware of pain in my thumb and I can pick things up without wincing every time. I love that it is easy to adjust to fit tighter. My thumb joint is enlarged with arthritis so by time I get a ring large enough to go over it, it is very loose and annoying to wear. Not with this ring, it easily adjusted to fit snugly. I only gave it four stars because it does leave a black ring underneath. But the pain relief makes it well worth wearing it anyway."
5,Dial Blue Grit Bath Bars For Men,I was so glad to finally find this type of soap for my husband. They had stopped carrying it at all of the stores close to where we live. My husband loves this soap and I will be purchasing it again through amazon.com. Thank you so much.
2,Not Recharge,"The product is listed as Dial for Men - Recharge, but is actually Blue Grit.Recharge is a great soap, but Blue Grit is not. Have no idea why Dial has changed from a great soap to a bad soap.The Blue Grit also comes as 4 oz and not 4.5 oz as shown.Won't buy Dial again unless the actual recharge soap is offered."
4,Artie Traum: Essential DADGAD for bebinners,"very good dvd however, it really applies to folks who play at least a little guitar before jumping into ""open"" tuning. Regardless, if you just want to sing along in front of the campfire with your friends, you can learn a lot about simply strumming the guitar to get by."
2,Sex book with too much in-your-face closeups,"This was also used for Bombshell Boobies (only the stories differ): Okay, I thought this was going to be pretty artwork (books like that exist - though rarely - like Manara's Gullivera). Instead, it's a pretty hum-drum sex book using too many close ups and unimaginatively drawn characters (who are techincally drawn okay but look dull) and quiet gross ""flying fluids"" exageration. The stories are the same-ole repressed male fantasy stories you can hear anywhere - although not as original (forbidden fruit gets stale) as some grass-roots stories. Boring. If not stupid. Erotic only to the lame. I own quiet a bit of plain-jane non-erotic mainstream manga and I can only say that there are far better artists with talent both in drawing and layout out there. Indeed, Japanese manga artists are some of the best illustrators I've run across - but not all of them."
4,To Short to be a Shadow Hearts,"Okay, I heard about this game a while ago and finally it came out. Poor me I had to wait I thought. I loved the previous two shadow hearts. The first is my favorite because it was a slightly more conventional RPG. I like the darker feeling of it. This one however was very short. It had a ridiculas number of side quests for how short it was. The story was a tad bit choppy at time. Though the battle system has been enhanced a little more. The combo system is nicer now because all the charaters can pull of two moves at once. The charaters on their own can now pull a duble which can get one out jams. Though the enemy cna also pull the same stunts. Though over all it would have been much better if they had taken longer to creat it and put more time into developing a better story that would develop a little more through out. Though it is deffinitly worth a play through."
3,"Hey, if you like cracked out games...",Shadow Hearts: From the New World... Hmm... How to put this...If you're some Final Fantasy head who has various wet-dreams involving Cloud and Sephiroth in various positions this game isn't for you. If you're a person who has various wet-dreams involving imagination and interesting plot lines in various positions while game mechanics sits off to the side in a dark corner and does who knows what than this game is for you.
4,Solid RPG,"They say that 3rd times a charm, and this third installment to the series is no exception. It's a fun game overall, and has an engaging story and cast of characters. There is a lot of micromanagement which can be tedious at times, but it doesn't detract from the game. It's definitely worth the price of admission."
1,Disappointing.,"I'm of the opposite opinion of most people who played this game. Unfortunately, I'm a fan of the original, having played it first, while many who have played this game did not have the benefit of the first. I felt that much of the story was ridiculous, turning the series into a farce. Everyone has their right to enjoy it, if that's what they did, but it was not for a die-hard fan of SH1."
2,Meh...,"This game is nothing compared to Shadow Hearts and Shadow Hearts Covenant. I really did not get attached to the characters like I did with the previous games. I enjoyed the bit roles from old characters like Lenny, Roger Bacon, Keith Valentine etc. but they were just that...tiny roles. And the Valentine sister, so annoying. If you really want a good game, play Shadow Hearts Covenant. I could play that game everyday, forever :)"
1,Conuterfeit blades claimed to be original.:(,"The comapny claims these cartiriges are brand new in original box. However, my experience shows the following:1. The cartirges arrived in an opened package which had labels, probably from a retail store, removed from its back. It was obvious that this ""original box"" was previously used2. After using the first blade it felt like I am shaving with sand paper. It was a counterfeit. The top blue layer with soothing gel felt like rubber.3. I went to Target and bought true original blades to compare. The experience with the original blades was smooth and nice shaving."
1,Where does it end?,"This razor gives a good shave, but, it is really not that much better than the M3 or even the the Sensor. It certainly is not worth the outrageous price Gillette is charging for refill blades. Twice as much as M3 and 3 times as much as Sensor.$ 28.00 for 8 blades? Ridiculous!!"
4,"Great Shave, Expensive Price","I'll concur with others on the closest shave yet. The head is massive but it glides really well. I completely disagree about the blade on the back being useless. Without that blade, which cuts very close safely, I would not be able to cut my mustache area due to the size of the head. When compared to the Mach3 which you had to use for this area the closeness is not even in the same league. That's my problem area for closeness and so far the Fusion is the best I've used. My only con is how damn expensive the blades are. I'm trying my best to only use 2 a month, shaving every other day and none on the weekends, but that's about the best I can do. That works out to about $6 a month just to shave. I'm going to have to start growing a beard year round and walking to work pretty soon with all of the astronomical increases in prices. What option do you have though?"
3,Outrageous,"$3.50 every time you change blades is just insane. May I recommend Gillette's 'Good News Pivot Plus with Lubrastrip' 12 pack for 50 cents each. And there's a guy selling Platinum double-edge blades on ebay for fifteen cents. A lot of people think these things are better than the Fusion /or/ the Pivot. Lots of hype, but Gillette has gone backwards in the past fifty years in my opinion. I will say one thing: the Pivot Plus is a marvel of plastics technology and quality control. It gives a pretty good shave, but not as good as the double-edges I used as a kid."
2,"Close shave, but not as close as the Mach3.","The good news with this razor is that the single blade on the reverse makes a neat job of sideburns and mustache area for men. Unfortunately, this is the only improvement over the Mach3. It also delivers an inferior shave compared to its predecessors.Despite the introduction of the Phantom version, which gives men a more palatable black over the original orange, the shave it gives is still an inferior one."
3,Nice but a bit expensive,"Okay so they upped my blades from three to five, but I can still just stick with three. I think I will do that for the fact that although I do really like these new blades, they are high in cost compared to the M3 I normally use. I do like the way the blades are set neatly in the plactic molded container so you just retrieve them by sticking the handle in, hearing the click and then pulling it out. The others I use have the plastic tabs you have to break off and then shake the blade out. I think this part is a great improvement in the retrieval of the blade. It does give a close shave and when you first give it a go you have to be a little careful because five blades is really almost overkill. I did like the ones I bought to try, but will not buy more until they come down in price. It is hard to justify spending that much money on these blades when a lot less money and a steady hand can still produce the same result."
3,"Fantastic but not in my ""club"" anymore","These razors are fantastic but I never realized how much money I could be saving by switching to a comparable product. Gone are the days I payed an exorbitant amount of money for this pack. I cut down my expense to $36.00 a year by using ""dollarshaveclub"" service."
5,wow,They are very sharp. Watch out because now there are six blades to cut yourself with. One of the blades isn't placed right tho. hmmmThey do make a face feel better after the shave tho.
3,Feel like I'm being hornswoggled,"Did you ever spend $20 on something wondering if it even does what it says on the box? That's how I feel about this product.I wonder if the extra blades even do anything useful during my shave. But the real question here is whether the ""power"" part of this product differentiates it at all from the non-""power"" version. Really, what's the difference? I couldn't tell any during my shave.But... Compared to the Schick multi-blade razors, the Fusion is incredibly better. The wire that holds in the Schick blades makes for not as close a shave. The Fusion's extra single blade is a great innovation, something they should consider for their single-blade model.Still, this all leaves me wondering if I shouldn't just get my own straight razor and avoid this monthly razor tax."
3,fusion blades,Not worth the price!! The M3's do just as good and are a safe and reliable shave. Getting to be a rip off!!
1,do not buy!,"I first tried the fusion power razor, I thought it was great! But hold on I purchased the replacement blades and WOW! They were terrible!!! they seemed really dull BEFORE I used them. I don't know if Gillette is using the ole bait n switch or what, But my first blade lasted about 3 months and gave a great shave. The replacements are garbage, don't waste your money. Just my opinion."
4,Good Product,I am a previous mach3 user and made the switch to fusion power becauseit is a more comfortable shave and I can make blades last for 15 daysor so.
3,Fusion Power Cartridges,"This item arrived before the ""expected"" date. The first blade did not give a good shave. I contacted the vendor, who offered to exchange the blades, or just give me a credit upon receipt of the returned blades. (Purchase was for my friend).Since I knew we didn't want a credit, I suggested that my friend try a different blade, and the 2d blade was better than the 1st one. So he decided to keep the blades. We have had this happen with these blades before - and contacted Gillette directly ourselves, and they replaced them! It's not the vendor's fault - this isa problem with Gillette. We have no problem with Amazon or their vendor."
1,"THESE ARE KNOCK OFFS, THEY ARE HORRIBLE","I BUY THESE BLADES FOR MY HUSBAND ABOUT ONCE A MONTH. WE HAVE NEVER HAD AN ISSUE BEFORE. I SEARCHED AND FOUND SOME THAT WERE CHEAPER ON AMAZON THOUGH A WHOLESALER, ALL THE TIME WHOLESALE. THEY WERE 17.99+4.59 SHIPPING. HE GOT THEM A WEEK LATER. THE FIST TIME HE USED THEM HE HAD CUTS ALL OVER HIS FACE, HE STILL HAD SHORT HAIRS THAT HAD NOT BEEN SHAVED OFF AS THE BLADE WAS VERY DULL, AND HIS FACE WAS BURNING. ON THE BACK OF THE BLADE THE ORANGE STRIP HAD BEEN WORN OFF JUST FROM ONE SHAVE. THESE ARE DEFINATLY KNOCK OFFS. WE COMPARED THEM FROM ONES WE ORDERED BEFORE AND THEY DO NOT LOOK THE SAME. I USED ONE OF THE BLADES TO SEE IF MY HUSBAND WAS RIGHT, AND IT WAS HORRIBLE. I GOT RASOR BURN AND STILL HAD LITTLE HAIRS THAT WERE NOT REMOVED AS THE BLADE WAS SO DULL. WE WILL NEVER PURCHASE BLADES FROM ALL THE TIME WHOLE SALE AGAIN, OR EVEN AMAZON IF THEY CONTINUE DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM ."
1,"Rips the skin, but does shave close!","The love of my life has always used this brand of shaver and when this newer model came out we bought it for an upgrade. While it does shave close, for the first time ever my loves skin is ripped and cut up every single time. So you need to think hard before this upgrade. The model just before this new one worked very well."
1,Beware with rust,"Three months ago, I bought 48 Gillette Fusion Power refills (quite an investment), and placed them on my bathroom drawer, and to my surprise, last week I went to replace a cartridge, and found that ALL, literally all, were completely rusted !It's a a shock, and all Mach 3 I had there for longer than that were just like new.How can P&G; can explain that??"
1,Too cheap at any price,"This product looked good for the price. Too good infact, think it was a knockoff. Don't waste your money."
1,THEY WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY AND GIVE YOU NOTHING,I ordered this on 09/23/2009 and it is now almost the end of october... I have been had.I love how they take your money and never give you what you pay for. If this is fair then I dont know what fair is. DONT ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE EVER!!! THIS IS THE ONLY TIME I HAVE EVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH AMAZON.COM. They do a great job and it's sad that this happened.I am not doing business with AMAZON again.
2,It was ok..not as great as I thought....,"I bought the Fusion Power because I am a huge Federer fan and he endorsed this product so I thought why the heck not!! I have a pretty sensitive skin and I thought that this product would work out great for me. I was right. I absolutely loved the product which is why I ordered this replacement cartridges pack from amazon. For some reason though, these blades feel different, and not in a good way. Compared to the blade that came with the razor, these blades are really bad. I still found a way to make these blades work slightly better for me, but I was and am really disappointed. Maybe I got the bad ones or something, but do not buy this pack expecting it to work the same way as the one that came with the razor....."
1,Caveat emptor,"These are the best blades you can buy. I usually get two months of shaves out of one blade! Bought some here from Hotdealz and went through 8 blades in 5 weeks. After reading some of Hotdealz responses to negative reviews, I saw they get a little touchy when someone cries ""counterfeit"". I'll refrain from that here. You decide: Normally one blade in 8 weeks. Eight Hotdealz blades in 5 weeks. Hmmm. Not such a hot deal. Let the buyer beware. Stick with a reputable dealer, like Amazon."
2,Fake! Fake! Fake!,These are not the real ones you buy at the store. I bought the exact same package from walgreens and the blades felt completely different.
4,Pricey but good,"My first time using a powered stick razor. I definitely get closer shaves when using the power in addition to the 5 blades. The power is nothing more than a small vibrator motor, like a cell phone, but it provides a closer shave because you end up applying more pressure with slower strokes. I used to get 2 or 3 days out of the Mach 3 before it was semi-dull. I can get about a week of close shaves and an additional week of not-so-close shaves out of the Fusion.Overall, the best razor I've ever had. Also, the most expensive blades I've had to purchase but Amazon's subscribe-and-save program is cheaper than Wal-Mart!"
4,Works for me,"Overview: I have been using these blades with my Fusion Razor and they do a great job of giving me a close shaveCloseness: These blades are very sharp and take off hair with one strokeEase of use: All you have to do is snap the handle bit of the razor to the blades and your good to goReliability: I use these blades a lot, they do not dull quickly so I get a long life span out of each of them (usually 2 weeks)Pros: the extra blade on the back for little stuff is actually more useful than one may think, also the strip runs down when you should change your blade which if you are lazy is great.all in all: I would recommend this to somebody looking for a razor that gives a close shave without giving up comfort"
4,Great Razor!,Best and smoothest shave I ever Had. The only thing wrong the better the shave the more expensive it gets. Thank goodness for Amazon. Nice blades!!
5,DELUXE SHAVING,"I am 71 years old and this is the best razor blade I have ever used. No nicks, no pulling and smooth as a baby's butt!"
3,Good product,Gillette Fusion razors are pretty good. For some reason they last only for few shaves. My old Mach3's used to last a long time...
2,Avoid them,"A rep-off!!! you pay a lot of money to get a bad quality blades. I have tried all the products Gillette produces and unfortunately they all are bad quality so expensive blades. Eventually, I went old school, safety razors are the best you'll every get. try it and you'll say GOD how didn't know about these razors!"
3,trimming blade not so accurate,I have problems using the trimming blade around the nose due to the pivoted movement of the blade causing innacurate shave ( I use moustache and beard) I have to use my valuable running out stock of Gillette microtrac razors to complete the operation.
5,Sara Dane,"I loved the book, it was extremely enspiring and showed the true strength of the character (Sara) and described the beauty that Australia was and still is with such perfection. It was breathtaking and I have already read it 5 times this year!!"
3,upclass snobs,I enjoyed the strength of Sara's character as other reviewers mentioned. But the story is the point of view of European wealthy colonists to Australia. I found that viewpoint tiring. Money and status and clothes and power seemed to be what was important -- that's what all Sara's strength of character got her. Lots of snobbery and classism.
4,Love Waylon,"I ordered this for my husband who is a HUGE Waylon fan. He loves it, and our 2 year old son also loves listening to it with Dad."
5,Excellant,Worth every penny. The chemistry captured in this video is timeless. I'm sure there were better concerts out there but this is another great moment in time preserved.
1,There are no words...........,It just stinks.... Could'nt even watch all of it. Even the female nudity did not make it watchable...
2,Not such a great book.,"If you do not have the javadoc API reference, this book will be very helpful. But this is not the case for most Java programmers. The book does offer things more than what you have in the html javadoc, however, they are VERY limited. As the dynamic html reference gets richer in each 1.1.x release, the benefit of buying this hardcopy deminishes. The samples in this book are largely overstated. They are more of decorations rather than real things.In short, be cautious. If the book description makes you consider buying this book, you'd better find it in a nearby bookstore and read several pages first - to make sure this is what you want."
3,frustrating!,"The graphics in this game are very good but the single player gameplay can be very frustrating. Each time you are killed (which happens alot due to basically one shot and your dead) you respawn each time way back and have to traverse across the map all the way back over and over. It gets to the point where you die, then just hold down your run key, close your eyes and take a little nap until you get back to the waypoint again... very frustrating and that gets a little dull. And there's no way to save your game at all! No quick saves at all.Also, the AI is completely mindless in this game. They just stand in one place most of the time until you pick them off. And, there doesn't seem to be a lot of people playing this game online either. Just about all the public servers have zero people in the maps, especially the deathmatch maps. Battlefield 2 is a lot more fun. I think I might be giving up on novalogic and switching over to EA with Battlefield 2."
2,A poor remake,I've been a Delta Force gamer for many years and have upgraded to almost every new version. This one left me dissapointed. So much so that I don't even play it (have stuck with Joint Ops instead.)
4,Good Game But Too Short,"Though this game is very fun to play, it is also very short (20 single player missions). But the multiplayer is also fun. This game is short because the company didnt spend too much time on this. If you loved delta force 1, you will love this even more. If you just want to play the single player missions then you should rent this game. There also might be an expansion for it. Anyways deffinetly try this game out."
3,Disappointing,"Concidering this game is an istallment of the great Delta Force series, Xtreme was a disappointing experiense. It does not carry the great selection of weapons and characters like it's predecessors, and the missions are rather boring. If you like Delta Force games, and want to keep liking them, STAY CLEAR of Delta Force Xtreme. It does not deserve to be compared to earlier Delta Force games."
5,The Mods Make the Game,"[...].Very easy to install. Download the file. Make a mirror copy of your game in your Novalogic folder. Call it DFXBFM. Install the mod in this folder. Always keep a copy of the original game in the folder in case there are problems later. Not needed as you can just reinstall, but handy. Several Servers for the MOD.There was another mod called DFX D3. It got to cluttered so they made a completely new one and used all the weapons, maps, etc for it. Just released.....If you like ""Sniper"" games, drop in DFV's server. This game really has come along ways since Novalogic dumped it unfinished on the gaming community. See you in the game. Check out the mods on the internet searching DFX DJ3 or BFM."
4,"a little nebulous, but all you'll ever need to know","There is so much info in here its hard to know where to start, but it is all in here so you wont be disappointed."
5,It's a very funny and interesting.,"My name is Edward Welch, I read the book about Brer Rabbit and Friends while I was sitting in a speical place. It made me laugh because Brer Rabbit was always trying to fool people. He always played jokes on people, but he got caught.I learn a lesson to always be careful because you can get into alot of trouble by fooling others. We should always helping and share with others.I want to know if you are going to write another book soon?I am sharing my book with my friends. They like it very much. One of my friends mother said she is going to get it for a present.Please keep writing books.Edward"
5,Still goin' strong!,"OK.....so here I am.......the author.....writing a review for MY book. My Brer Rabbit first came into the world eight years ago and I'm still very proud of him. Of all the stories for children that I've written, the Brer Rabbit stories are the best and my favorites. I get a special joy out of seeing so many children and adults get a kick out of hearing and reading Brer Rabbit's stories. I am a performing storyteller so I have the opportunity to share these stories often, out loud, entering Brer Rabbit's world and sharing with my audience what I see and feel. I become that rabbit, that fox, that bear, et al and I bring my audience right along with me. The stories in this book, especially when read aloud, with take you into Brer Rabbit's world where you are truly welcomed and the FUN is non-stop. ENJOY!"
3,The Tar Baby,I was expecting the story to be written in its original language. I did not like the new grammatically correct language. It spoiled the story altogether. I was sorry that I bought the book. I grew up reading the Uncle Remus stories as they were told by Uncle Remus. My grandchildren now want those stores. I would like to find the original Uncle Remus stories. Do you have them? I wish I had known that tese books had been changed to a different version before I bought them.
4,Curso Intensivo de Español,"As a 49 years old student of Spanish, who is in constant business and social contact with native speakers, I need a quick and practical exercise book. In this collection of three books, with key, I found all I needed in terms of words usage (which can be tricky in Spanish), verbal tense utilization and everyday sentences plus questions and standard answers one is sure to encounter sooner or later. Some special expressions that add zest and personality to the language are present in the exercises and I'd like to exemplify with the famous ""vale"", ""oye"" or ""viva"" that one can hear as soon as out of the airport in Madrid. I use these books with my private teacher both as an exercise source and as read aloud material, but one can go through them alone as well."
3,"Good Review Book, Bad Intro Book","It's a good review book if you know your material and just need a quick refresh or need the same concept explained differently. However, this book will intimidate you if you're new to computer science. An example would be in Chapter 1, the words ""stack memory management and recursive functions or procedures"" were thrown at the readers without any explanation."
1,"I think I had a worse textbook once, ten years ago","The excessive reliance on ML and poor language skills exhibited are well covered in the other reviews. I'd just like to add that Mitchell has a terrible habit of explaining things out of order (for instance, activation records are explained on page 165, but you are expected to know them on page 148), and his ""This is beyond the scope of this book."" handwaving makes many of the explanations completely incoherent.I have never sold back a textbook before, but I'm taking this back to the bookstore right after my final, and then I'll get a real Comparative Programming Languages textbook."
4,Jazz is Alive,Jimmy Brings out the word JAZZ he takes you to this other world called jazz. I was never a jazz person but when i heard this album it took my heart away.
2,Simplified Scientific Astrology,"I am very disappointed in this book because there is no interactive contents. I mean, come on - this is an astrological work tool. I need to be able to go through and index different aspects at different times. I don't doubt that the information is extremely insightful and very helpful (I have a hard copy of this book that I can no longer read due to eye problems) but it is almost worthless to me as it is. The only readon I gave it two stars is because of the wonderful content."
5,GOOD FOR BUILD UP AND OXIDATION,I USED THIS ON MY 05 4-RUNNER. FOR COME REASON I HAVE ALWAYS GOTTEN A DULL BUILD UP ON THE BUG GUARD AFTER EVERY WASH. I TOOK IT BACK TO TOYOTA AND OF COURSE THEY SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO. AFTER TRYING SEVERAL PRODUCTS I TRIED THIS ONE. IT DOES THE TRICK BY REMOVING ALL THE OXIDATION AND MAKES IT LOOK SHINNY AND NEW :-)IT ALSO IS GOOD FOR MINOR BUILD UP ON HEADLIGHTS IF YOU CATCH IT BEFORE IT GETS TOO BAD IT WILL HELP. I RECOMMEND GIVING IT A CHANCE.
5,The best baby toy out there!,"This is our daughters absolute favorite toy! She received this toy at 10 months, and plays with it everyday. She is 13 months old, and this toy still holds her interest! She likes the music on or off, it doesn't matter. The water in the fish bowl fasinates her. She loves all the Fisher Price Ocean water toys."
4,Great sounds!,"I purchased this item for my son when he was 6 months old. He truley loves it! He is 2 now and still plays with it! The best part is the ""easy to listen to"" music! The fishbowl has not become annoying like many infant/ toddler toys do."
4,Cute and playful toy,This toy has wonderful music and the balls that come with it and great for holding the attention of your little one. My son enjoys dancing to this fishbowl and playing with the balls inside of it. He doesn't seem to care much for putting the balls back into the bowl in order to make it work. He does enjoy carrying it around and rocking the owl so it will play for him though.
2,boring and not worth the $$,"This toy looked so cute online but i was very dissapointed once it got here. The fish get stuck all the time, there is even one fish (the biggest) that I cannot get loose from the top of the bowl. There is some kind of ""grate"" thing at the top that the fish's fin fits right into and now will not come lose. There is only one ""song"" if you want to call it that and I find it really boring. My girls 3 and 9m could care less about this toy. they could have done much more with this bowl!"
5,Wonderful toy,"My son received this toy at 5 1/2 months and he loves it! It's a great toy for him now that he's sitting up, he can rock the toy and he loves to see the lights and music come on. Would highly recommend this toy to everyone."
4,So cute!,"We have to wait and see how our son likes this toy, since he's still waiting to be born! We got it for our neighbor's son and he really enjoyed it.That being said, I am completely captivated by it. The bowl lights up and rewards baby (or mommy!) with a song or ""ocean"" sounds when one of the balls or another object is dropped in. The balls have colorful little plastic figures that spin. Glitter and fish move when the bowl is moved. I think it's going to be a real hit.UPDATE: My son enjoys this toy as much as I'd hoped. He loves to pull the bowl over and inspect the inside, and seems so pleased when the balls roll out and then he can put them back in. The sounds, lights, and glitter on the bowl hold his interest for quite a while. All in all, an excellent toy for him."
2,Not a Wonder for us,"This is a very attractive toy. The ocean sounds are so realistic you feel as if you were on the beach. That is my impression. My grandson (10 months) however has a different view.For the first day or so after the toy arrived he would pick the balls up and hold them in his hands while trying to get the little items inside to spin around. However, they would only spin once or twice and stop. He would push the bowl around and listen to the ocean sound for a bit but it was too heavy for him to get it to make the splashing sound. I had to jiggle the bowl in order for him to hear that. He never quite got the ""dropping the balls in the bowl"" part. He would drop them in and nothing, to him anyway, would happen so that ended pretty quick.He hasn't played with it since that first day or two after it arrived.I would not recommend this product unless you are looking for a nice item to put on your child's shelf."
2,Never got his attention.,My son never seemed to take an interest in this toy. I liked the water motion and quiet music. I thought that maybe he would play with it when he was old enough to put the balls in the bowl but again he never played with it.
