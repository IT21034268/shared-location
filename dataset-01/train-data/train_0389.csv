4,topcat1951,"This is one of the best westerns made.The only flaw is the sound track 2.0 in todays world.All the older good movies from the 60s,70s,80s,and the 90s are in DTS or Dolby Digital why not Tombstone?I hope they rerelease it in 5.1 or DTS or both.Thats my only gripe about the move.I agree with all the reviews except the one with 1 star,dont know what he watched.This is a must see,and is as good as the Wild Bunch."
5,Not just another Wyatt Earp,"I'm not a fan of westerns or stories depicting historical characters, but Tombstone is the exception. I can watch this one over and over again and not tire of it. This is not just another story about Wyatt Earp, but a story of people taking a stand between right and wrong."
3,Tombstone on Blu Ray,"I have long felt that this was one of the greatest westerns ever made, an incredibly delivered story with amazing acting by all involved. Yes, Kilmer's Doc Holiday almost steals the movie but, never the less, a wonderful film. However, I wound up returning the Blu Ray disc simply because I wanted the whole film, not a cut version of it. The Standard Definition film with the full 135 minutes still retains excellent video and audio quality and I would rather have the entire version than a Reader's Digest Condensed version. Should they come out with the Directors cut on Blu Ray with the movie intact, then that is the one I will buy.Hopefully, this review has been of help and, if so, please check the 'Helpful' button so I know I am on the correct path with my reviews for you. Thanks.Steve Douglas"
5,All time great movie,"I have loved this movie since it came out. Its even better in the directors cut,as there are quite a few scenes that were not in the original."
3,Kilmer rates 5 stars +!,"I would have to agree with the majority of the respondents, that Val was incredible. I heard he starved himself for a month to actually look like a TB victim. Unfortunately for Val, he was the only believable character. He also had the best lines, ""Frederick Fu__in' Chopin"", ""I'm your huckleberry"", ""You're a daisy if you do"", etc. Russell is lame, and overacts his part. I think, no matter how frickin long it was, Wyatt Earp (Costner's movie) was better, with the exception of the performance of the actor playing Doc Holliday (although Dennis Quaid was pretty fair himself). This movie seemed to appeal to the younger MTV generation, who grew up with the ""Gang Bangin"" mentality that this movie seems to glorify! Kilmer 5 stars, the rest of the movie 2 stars!!!"
3,Tombstone missing scenes,"I loved the movie, even have it on Laser Disc, with deleted Scenes. these DVD's do not have this stuff on it... and that is the problem..... what a shame.."
3,The Director's Cut Hits The Bullseye,"Although I'm a greater fan of the Lawrence Kasdan / Kevin Costner version of Wyatt Earp's life, TOMBSTONE -- the Director's Cut -- is a marked improvement from the original threatrical version. Several key scenes are extended from the original release, and many new scenes are added that give the characters a bit more emotional depth. While much of the action still remains over the top, Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer epitomize the violence so prevalent between the lawmen and the Cowboys of the time period. Don't be duped, however, by the documentaries; they're very short, and they truly don't add much to the experience. While some interesting tidbits are thrown out about the making of the picture, very little is of relative substance."
4,An accurate movie about a controversial historic event.,"According to INVENTING WYATT EARP by Allen Barra (Carroll and Graff, 1998), this is the most accurate retelling of the still controversial conflict between the Earp Brothers and the Clanton gang at Tombstone. The Earps were neither saints nor sinners, but they were basically the good guys in the riveting event that is most accurately, though less felicitously, described as ""The Gunfight in the Vacant Lot behind the O. K. Corral."" Doc Holliday, perhaps the most intriguing personality in the old west, is said to be accurately portrayed by Val Kilmer."
5,Tombstone - a modern classic,"Though I am no fan of Kurt Russell or Val Kilmer, their performances, along with very strong supporting performances by Sam Elliot, Dana Delaney and others, make this film a real pleasure. The writers and director were certainly fans of the Western genre and had learned a thing or two from John Ford and others before they set out to make this picture, and this may have been the first ""neo classic"" followed recently by ""The Mask of Zorro"" and ""The Mummy"". Surprisingly, it is actually more accurate to the life story of Wyatt Earp than Costner's mess ""Wyatt Earp"". It is much more satisfying than other modern Westerns, particularly those of Clint Eastwood, whose brooding and gloomy vision may be historically accurate but is awfully depressing. Along with ""Silverado"" it is a modern classic,and a great deal of fun with with strong acting and an excellent script. However, sensitive persons and children under 14 probably should avoid the picture due to its episodes of violence."
3,"Entertaining, But Far From Good","""Tombstone"" was not a bad movie. It just doesn't stand out as a good movie. The scenes tend to jump around a lot, and are choppy. Overall, the movie seems rushed into production and forced.Val Kilmer is wonderful in the role of Doc Holliday, and in addition the actor that played Virgil Earp really gave a great performance. Kurt Russell did not make a convincing Wyatt Earp though.If you are a big time fan of Western movies, you might like this film. Its entertaining, and has its good moments. If you're NOT a western film fan, rent it before buying. This film is average to at best slightly above average overall."
2,Tombstone on DVD,"Don't get the wrong idea about that 2 star rating -- we LOVED the movie, have worn out two VHS copies. Have been waiting with excitement for the Director's Cut as we KNOW there are many, many minutes that never made it to the screen. Want to thank all of you who have reviewed it. Will NOT be purchasing it now as not particularly interested in all the trailers, interviews, map, etc. Can only hope now for a Special Edition release. We want all those clips that would fill in the missing pieces, make this a more cohesive film and enhance the characters. As to the movie itself ... it's right up there at the top of our BEST FILM list."
2,No Upconvert to HD,"I tried this disc with a PS3, a Samsung 1080P upconverter, and a Sony BR player, all of which have the capability to upconvert standard DVD to 1080P. However, this disc will not upconvert using any of those devices. The best that you'll see on your HD-set is the movie in letter-box format, and that only fills up about thirty-percent of the screen. Bah!!!"
3,"If Kilmer were the only star, the movie would rate 5!","I, along with many others, think that Val's performance was worthy of an Oscar. His was the only redeeming character in this film. Kurt ""I Love a good Disney flick"" Russel was, as always, totally overacting. Val stole the show! He not only had the best lines, but was more convincing in his performance than any ""Doc Holliday"" I have witnessed. Yes, I have witnessed them all! It is a total shame that Val did not take home an Oscar for this film, and even more of a blunder, that he was not even nominated. But, those Hollywood people, what do they know about acting!"
5,The best western movie ever!!!!!,I have seen quite a few western movies and this is by far the greatest western. I never get tired of watching this movie. Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer were fabulous. Full of gunslingin' action and don't forget about the gorgeous Dana Delaney. A must see movie before you die.
3,Political Correctness In The Old West,"Didn't know how Feministic the women were in the old West, or how open society was to bi-sexuality. Plently of unsubtle dabbling in these themes - although anachronism is part of the B+ movie lexicon.The best moment comes from the very sensuous, under-appreciated actor Dana Delany: she steps off the Coach as she arrives in town and shares a rapturous, prolonged glance with Kurt Russell (Wyatt Earp). Her close-up is enough to wake Truman Capote (All due respect...).Val Kilmer does okay as Doc Holliday - I think he might have unconsciously refereced Brando in ""Mutiny On The Bounty"", but here he seems slighlty less interested in the fairer sex. Not that there's anything wrong with that.Cinematography is excellent and the picture is well-paced."
2,Wyatt Earp is MUCH better than Tombstone!,"I usually HATE westerns, but while having another of my insomniac attacks, I ended up watching Wyatt Earp with Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid, etc. I don't EVEN like Kevin Costner, but LOVED this movie and have watched it several times since!Being interested, now, in the life of Mr. Earp, my husband and I rented Tombstone. What a disappointment!!!!! I love Kurt Russell, but was sooooooo disappointed in his characterization of Wyatt Earp. He seemed like such a coward, always wanting to run to get away from the ""bad guys""! WHAT?!?!? Totally different portrait than anything I've ever heard or read of the REAL Wyatt Earp.Now, again, Val Kilmer did an excellent job portraying Doc Holliday! ""I'll be your Huckelberry!"" Too funny! We LOVED his performance! He is actually the only reason for watching this movie!Watch both Tombstone and Wyatt Earp -- and you will see that Wyatt Earp is a MUCH better movie!!!"
5,Tombstone [Blu-ray] Tombstone [Blu-ray],"Anyone who has seen this wonderful classic Western would be happy to have a copy of it, especially in Blu-ray! I enjoy seeing this movie at least once a year and now I can see it whenever I want. The price was great...it would make a super gift to anyone who wants to own a classic movie! Now, someone needs to make another classic Western!!!"
5,Awesome!,My husband and I have this movie on DVD but he really had been wanting to get it on Blu-Ray. Much better!! He loves this movie and I find myself watching it with him every time he puts it on. Very exciting and action packed!
5,Great Western,The movie was well portrayed by the actors. The story line followed what we know about the life and times in old Tombstone.
5,Tombstone - a classic western,"The story of Wyatt Earp, played by Kurt Russell, is a western we have watched over and over. Val Kilmer, as Doc Holiday, did a superb job. The story is a sequel to the Wyatt Earp movie in which Kevin Costner portrayed him. Robert Mitchum's narrative at the beginning and the end completes it."
3,Like Your Western in Spanish? or French?,"Unless you want to watch ""Tombstone"" in French or Spanish, make sure you have DTS equipment for this Blu-ray issue. I have an older Pioneer with Dolby Digital 5.1, and there was no sound unless I selected French or Spanish. This means that many people can't enjoy this great western."
5,"A ""Don't waste your time in Hawaii"" guidebook","Fantastic guidebook. Why? a) It is exhaustive. b) It makes value judgements. Most guidebooks do one, but not the other. Just do the activities marked ""A real gem"" and you're almost guaranteed to have a great vacation. We did, and we were plesantly surprised at each spot."
4,"Good, honest travel info","If you can get past the typos and editing errors, this is a great source of information for traveling on the Big Island. Lots of color photos and useful advice on dining and accommodations. My only complaint, aside from the text errors, is that you have to access the web site to look at many lodging reviews. If I wanted to go to the web, I wouldn't buy a book."
2,Letdown,"Somehow we never got excited about using this one. We would have liked more things for our little ones to do. The restaurants were on the tad expensive side and so were the hotels. We wanted this, our second honeymoon (with kids along) to be special and it fell FLAT."
5,"To fully grasp the video, put Jaco's state of mind behind.","I found the video very topical, yet refreshing because the whole reason for it was has I remember a quote from the book""Greatest Bass player..."" Jaco just wanted to get this done with, and keep on grooving."
4,Jaco Dvd,Well I am delighted to see a good musician like an ordinary man.It was sincere because he was a sincere guy.I liked this dvd because of its sincerity.And the plus; the exercise book was pretty good.
4,"A lot of cool playing, but little instruction","In this video, there is a couple of really good pieces, like Portrait of Tracy, and some cool solos, but as for an instructional video, it's not so great. However, the booklet that comes with it has music to almost everything that he plays. The jam session at the end is pretty cool too."
5,A showcase of this fabulous bass player,An excellent video that show the world's greatest bass player playing exercises and telling his story. This video is a great way to learn many different exercises and also see Jaco play some astounding improvisation. It makes for an excellent source of influence for any bass player.
2,Watery,Extremely watery!! It smells fine but is messy since it has no thickness to it. It did come packaged well.
5,This CD Now becomes a classis For real,"Today we bow our heads in prayer. With sadness in my heart, I must report that Terrence Vine better known as Sporty T, was shot and killed while asleep in his FEMA Trailer, yesterday, 15 July 2008. He left the rap game several years ago to focus on his children and his family. Further information can be obtained by surfing to [...], the local New Orleans newspaper. RIP Sporty."
4,The Church FATHERS,"Any book which meets its aim to present the thoughts of the church ""Fathers"" (as this book does) deserves to be evaluated on its stated intentions. Does this volume do an admirable and coherent job of offering Christianity's earliest theologians' thoughts on the letters to Corinth? Absolutely. Is it reasonable to expect views from this period to be in sync with intricate theological statements written hundreds (even thousands) of years later? Of course not. Walking through these early reflections on Scripture with the Fathers creates a fresh sense that Christianity is rooted in history, and that Christianity has an observable historical development of its own. Fascinating, on its own merits. Also of merit is the opportunity to have multiple historical sources available in the same volume. Who likes to pick up and put away dozens of books at a time?"
2,Heretics included,"This book permits one to quickly find a lot of usefulreferences. However it is quite misleading as all kind of heretics areincluded. The word ""Christian"" should have been avoided in the title. Those who are interested in Church Fathers will have to be able to sort out the Fathers from the heretics, and that means they will have to know already a lot about the issues of orthodoxy and heresy among the ancient thinkers. In this case they will already know much, and this book may not be so useful. I do not recommend this book to those conservative Christians who do not know which thinkers were heretic or not."
5,The single most important collection of a master poet.,"Overpraised during his brief lifetime, and attacked by someof the same critics shortly after his death, Dylan Thomashas finally managed to emerge from the romantic hypesurrounding his name. His poems, some of which are among themost well-known in the English language, will live on whilethe muckraking dies out along with the people responsiblefor it. Regardless of his extravagant last years, DylanThomas has become known to subsequent generations as a poetof extraordinary craftsmanship and power. This collection isthe reason."
4,Dylan Thomas is an Amazing Poet,"Until recently, I had only heard of Dylan Thomas but after reading this book and various poems of his, he has quickly become one of my all time favorites! I read this book because for my honors english course at Syracuse University, I was assigned a presentation about Dylan Thomas. I feel that this book is an excellent way for people to learn more about Thomas and his poetry, I feel that it is a very well put together piece. I thouroughy enjoyed it."
5,Brilliant,"The sound and rhythm of his poetry is so lovely, he could have written perfect nonsense, and I wouldn't notice. I had to read many of the poems several times before I was able to focus on the content, rather than the wondrous form in which it was conveyed. However, the words proved to form equally profound pictures.He used language and sound in a way uniquely his own. While others struggle to fit their poems into some rigid prescribed boundary, or toss their words carelessly on a page, Thomas's poetry grows naturally according to its own rules and boundaries. This produces a wild, rhythmic sound, like the sound of waves rolling in, then receding from the shore.Dylan Thomas's poetry is nothing less than amazing, and this collection is quite nearly perfect. I have read it ten times or so and intend to read it many more."
2,Good for carrying iPod if you don't plan to use it,"It probably would hold the iPod pretty well, but I returned it before giving it a fair trial in that aspect. For the price -- you don't get a whole lot of protection. There's nothing to secure the top, and the iPod has to be completely removed from the carrying case in order to use the click wheel and view the screen."
5,OUTSTANDING PIANO,"If you like piano at all, you will enjoy Matt Bachrach. He has several albums out now, on is called ""Senses"". Senses is a bit more commercial, including other instruments and incorporating a southwestern flavor. But however you slice it, this is truly great listening piano. Highly recommended."
5,"Great Stuff, that smells good","Cant beat Meguiar'sI was asked to wash a 76 corvette, that had cat remains and hair balls was on or is on the paint. Rinsed the car off with a presser washer, then used the two bucket wash system with this soap. Everything just fell off the car, when washing with this stuff. After I wash done washing, the car shined, even though it hadn't been waxed for years.I use this on my daily driver every week. I used some armor-all wash and wax (not the best stuff out there but its all I had at the time) about 4 months ago, and with using this, it looks like it was just waxed."
3,wrong picture,"The price was great, but the product in the picture is not the same as what you receive. They are just a bit different with a long slotted end. Not the stationary end like the picture."
3,Electronic Keyboard Stand for Casio CTK-700,This stand is very nice. I also like how securely it stays extended. My modest rating is a result of the awkward 'fit' of my Casio CTK-700 keyboard upon it. I have been unable to find a position where the keyboard fits flatly upon it and as a result the keyboard is a bit wobbly when I play.
3,WORTH THE READ,"I'm not sure if most teens will actually pick up this book but if the parent reads it and then re-reads portions aloud to teen, maybe some of it will get through."
5,A classroom text designed to introduce readers to comprehending the language and literature of England between 1150 and 1400,"Now in its third edition, enhanced with revisions to key works in light of new editions, updated bibliographies, and two new extracts from ""Pearl"" and Chaucer's ""Troilus and Criseyde"", A Book Of Middle English is a scholarly classroom text designed to introduce readers to comprehending the language and literature of England between 1150 and 1400. Part One focuses on understanding how to pronounce Middle English, and its rules of grammar, syntax, and applications of meter in rhyming verse; Part Two offers a selection of Middle English reading material including ""The Owl and the Nightingale"", The Cloud of Unknowing"", Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"", and many more. An excellent practical resource for literature students and scholars striving to better understand classical writings in their original language."
3,Not the best quality,"This is an attractive lamp and is nicely weighted and balanced. It's also a good size for a bedside table. The lampshade is substantial and gives off a good amount of soft light. The pull apparatis is smooth and works well. The lamp I received had chipped paint on the base which showed base metal beneath. The metal frame that holds the lampshade was crooked. Not crazy about the paint over base metal, but had it not been chipped and had the framing been straight I would have kept it. It's going back. Quality not what I expected."
5,Very Nice,"This is a really nice lamp! It seems to be quite sturdy and well-made, does not look cheap at all. Received is super fast - in just two days after ordering (with FREE super saver shipping!) in excellent condition (some reviewers mentioned broken glass, but not in my case). It even included the light bulb! Very happy with the purchase."
4,Nice and sturdy,Thought the base would be a bit lighter....it's a really really deep dark color.Love the glass shade and that it is white instead of green like most other banker lamps.Very heavy base. Nicely made...worth the money!
1,Poor quality,Switch broke in 3 months. Paint color is cheap. Would not recommend. Very disappointed in this purchase. . . .
2,not quite,"I was a little disappointed when receiving this lamp. I thought for $75 I would get a decent lamp. The texture on the metal was a little rough-made than I thought. Instead, I bought a different one from Amazon. Golden Brass Desk lamp from Conoco piano lampsBaroque White Desk / Piano LampIt is lower price but the quality is a LOT better. Highly recommend the other one from Amazon instead."
5,Great set of plans,"This is a really interesting and practical book of welding projects ranging from sports equipment to auto/repair equipment. I am in the process of converting a school bus into a motorhome and realized I could benefit from a competence in utilizing metals to build things. When doing a big project like an RV from a bare hull, you definitely could use ways to cut down costs, even thousands of dollars off by doing your own welding.I understand this isn't an instruction book - hence the word ""projects"" in the title. Instead of 'Welding how-to'. I would recommendWelder's Handbook, RevisedHP1513: A Guide to Plasma Cutting, Oxyacetylene, ARC, MIG and TIG Weldingfor learning HOW to weld.I looked briefly through this book and was excited to see plans for an automobile hitch. Something perfect for towing my car behind my RV. That's worth probably $200 right there, and all it'll cost me is parts."
2,Most wonderful movie in the world?,"While this book is enchanting in that it deals with a young girl wanting to see a movie that the world has told her is ""wonderful"" (which is debatable) it is disturbing to see people making it cute to try and ignore the teachings of the Church (founded by Jesus Christ) and decide for themselves (they think -- they are really putting the world ahead of Jesus) -- in other words we are supposed to find it cute that this girl can at this young age bludgeon the teachings of her faith to compromise with the world. Fine -- and what got us in our current mess? This book is OK for secular audiences but Christians of both branches should ignore it. There are better books out there."
4,"Bizzarre, But Entertaining","If you like Hong Kong actions flicks, this is a pretty good one. This is a movie and not a documentary. So enjoy it as such. The movie is a bit more straight forward than appears.The characters, themselves, are a bit unusual so your brain figures there must be some other subplot, which there really isn't. Also, there are two women in the movie that look similar and you can get confused. When you get them confused, you think something else is happening again. But that's OK.The confusion and misdirection add to the enjoyment of the film. It gives it a cinema verite feel. I really, really like it!"
5,"action, crime, thriller",I love the action in this chinese action movie. The picture looks good too. Tyler has had trouble all his life he has always dreamed of living in South America.
4,Pretty good movie,"Time and tide is a pretty good movie, but it's not quite as good as the hype would have you believe. There is a good amount of action and gunplay, but not nearly as much as Hardboiled. The best thing about this movie is that Tsui Hark tries some special effects and camera work that I haven't seen in a HK movie recently. Also, the production value of this movie seems to be a bit higher than normal HK movies. The story is pretty interesting although a bit confusing at times. If you just sit back and watch the movie w/out thinking too much, you should enjoy it."
5,This is a GREAT movie!,It is full of action and Drama. Also has Nicholas Tse in it which makes the movie even better.
4,more like high 4 like 4.8......,"Tsui Hark, once a genius( still is...in some ways)were always a step ahead of the HK directors..( like when everyone were making Wuxia with high flying and special effects, he came with 'Blade')This movie is like taking a rollercoaster ride when you're drunk and high and SICK at same time. Our main character, Tyler( pretty boy, Nicholas Tse) is a bartender and meets this one les cop one night. i duno what happened but they sleep together. and when he finds out she has his child, he starts to work for some Bodyguard company to make money...and there's the guy with long hair...( forgot his name, sorry). Whom, Tyler helps by accident and becomes friend...and he is an ex special force....some creative stuff but some scenes were not clear and dragging. but , Time and Tide still shows that Tsui Hark has genius ideas.....check out Legend of Zu...but with caution"
1,The worst,"I love the rampant genius of director Tsui Hark, but this movie was the abysmal pitts. Maybe fans of his other terrible ""American"" films will go for this one, but those that love his older works will scratch their head with disappointment."
2,Nonsense,"The book promulgates the notion that it was wonderful being a slave, and that all masters were benevolent and caring for their slaves. Not worth the time spent reading it."
3,intresting,I love ante-bellum history and this is interesting in the way it was written. It's easy to read and a bit informative if you have not read civl war and post civil war history. A good soft read.
3,A not-so-politically-correct ante-bellum book,I enjoyed this book. It is a view of life in the South prior to the Civil War as written by a former slave. I suspect strongly that life on the old plantation was a lot more like this than what was portrayed in ROOTS. But then perhaps Mr. Lowery was just an incorrigable liar. You read and decide.
2,A hard read,"A great many typos made this book really hard to read through. I won't bash the book because I don't agree with the author, but I do find it rather hard to believe that anyone of black decent will find agreement in this book. No matter how good a master treats you, if you are not a free man, you will never feel like a man."
2,very old fashioned,This book is interesting but more like a history lesson than a novel. If you love the old south you will enjoy it.
4,Old fashioned but still very nice to listen,"Time has certainly damaged this musical; still, it's very nice to listen to thanks to Carol Channing's singing presence. The musical is sparkling, nostalgic and quite charming. Some songs will certainly run for ages such as ""It's Delightful Down in Chile"" and the most famous ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"", a B'way musical icon for all times. I would recommend this CD to collectors of rare items since it has more historical than musical relevance. And that certainly counts from a cultural viewpoint."
2,Mediocre musical with classic Channing performance,"This was Jule Styne's first ""book"" musical comedy for Broadway and it is mediocre in the extreme - with the notable exception of three numbers (Bye Bye Baby, A Little Girl From Little Rock and Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend - the latter two rendered by debuting comedienne Carol Channing.) These three numbers and Channing's now classic renditions of the latter two are the ONLY reason for purchasing this album. The songs do not relate to the plot or characters and they are as forgettable as Channing is not. The original 14 78-rpm sides have been sonically restored, but there's nothing to enjoy here except Carol."
3,prime hardcore,"this is a intresting album, once you get a listen. it is aclassic of the hard core era. The Newark new jersy style is evident in apache's album. As a memeber of the flavor unit and NAUGHTY BY NATURE family he represents the hardcore and the real life"
1,Defective,"I don't know if it was just that this charger doesn't work on ipod videos, but mine didn't even charge. The red light came on, but when i plugged it in nothing happened. I was lucky i had the USB cord or i would have nothing. So basically, the one I received was either defective or these just don't work"
4,Great crackers! Quite a few broken in shipping though.,We really like these crackers. I was a bit disappointed that about half of the crackers were broken by the time they arrived at our door. I think I may just have to buy them from the store next time.
2,Useful to learn some expressions but not suitable for a Hebrew student,"I'm in the first course of Ulpan (Hebrew language school) and I bought this program to support my studies.There are 8 audio CD's containing 16 chapters (1 chapter 30 minuts). There aren't any written references (no text dialogues, no alphabet).The audio-course it's designed to be followed day after day (you shouldn't stop it because you'll forget what you've learned).If you are in a hurry to understand a little hebrew then it's a good tool to start with.But if you have already began to study hebrew with text books then I don't recommend you to purchase this course because it's worthless, there are a lot of websites where you can practice dialogues, daily situations and so on."
3,Nice,"Buy this and not the Basic Hebrew. I regret buying the Basic Hebrew by Pimsleur because it is just a replica of this Conversational Hebrew by Pimsleur. I bought the two products, this Basic Hebrew and the Conversational Hebrew--because I wanted to learn more- and the packaging was different-only to find out that this Basic Hebrew was just a copy of the Conversational Hebrew---the two are the same but packaged differently--Again, the two books are just the same! This Conversational Hebrew just has two extra CDS. I feel ripped off by Amazon--they advertised both-- and I had the impression that one would get more from both. No! They both have the same content! Please buy the Conversational Hebrew by Pimseleur instead b/c it has two extra CDs.I needed more vocabulary!"
3,Bad Conduct,"Jack Pertwee and Marilyn Thompson are to marry and Jack's friend George is treating him at the bar. Charlie Hatton is to be best man.Wexford finds the dead man, Charlie Hatton, in the river while walking a dog. Ordinarily policemen don't discover bodies. It turns out the dead man was late for the wedding and there was consternation. The groom doesn't want to get married. He wants to do what is right and proper.The dead man had been vain, aggressive, malicious. He had been carrying a lot of money. Wexford pursues his investigation. He goes into houses where tiredness and poverty are chronic. The lines of inquiry grow complex. Hijacked trucks may stand for several different things.This is an interesting, well-plotted mystery. Wexford and the dog are among the more amusing aspects of the book."
3,Carla Bley Meets Zappa,"I enjoyed listening to this. It would make a really good Carla Bley album. If it was Carla Bley I'd give it 4 stars. But it's not. It's her daughter. So, I deduct one star for the inability of Karen Mantler to do anything really unique. That having been said, there is a lot of good music on this disc. It is the story of Ms. Mantler's efforts to find a new pet after the death of her beloved cat, Arnold. It is a funny and touching story with Zappa-esque vocals and banter, and a very good band behind her to make it all come together. Nice production, good sound. Definetly worth checking out, especially if you're a Carla Bley fan."
4,In need of a Young MC,"Young MC will never go down in history as the best rapper, but he dosen't have to. In a time when there was such negativity in rap music, Young MC gave us a reason to relax and have fun. I have a love/hate relationship with todays rap music. I respect the talent that some of these guys have, but the lyrics are often mentally and spirtually destructive. We could use more Young MC's today."
4,Awesome!,"I bought this album on a total whim, given that my usual musical tastes include bands like Rush or Dream Theater. However, I really dig the vibe of this album. It's fun, catchy, and full of awesome and creative rhyme patterns. My favorite part is that it achieves greatness without resorting to extremely rough language and typical rap cliches."
5,5 stars for bust a move only,its funny how people try to make him bigger then what he was because his music was sterolized.when in fact he's lyrically weak.i always said rap is more then JUST HAVING FUN.either way bust a move is a great song.
2,Very basic overview,"While the book indeed produces a basic overview of Peruvian cuisine and its complexities, it is lacking all but the most simplistic histories and evolutions of Peruvian cuisine. The writing is neither compelling nor particularly well organized and edited. I was hoping for more."
4,New Item Price for Possible Used Item,"I am very pleased with the performance of this product. I paid for a ""NEW"" item, but am suspicious that this partwas a ""USED"" item or that it was manufactured a long time ago and was not protected from external corrosion.The product manufacturer's name; L.S. Starrett is always machined into the the part surface in distinct readablelettering. On this part it is partially ""faded"";(not normal). Also the are spots of ""minute"" rust in the knurled knob and the internal areas. Typically ""new"" steel products are wrapped in a corrosion resistant paper or have a protectant known as cosmoline on the part. I am using this product, it performs well, but I feel that I paid a ""new""price for a ""used"" part. I am in the machining trade and when I purchase a tool I want it to be ""perfect""; if boughtas ""new"". When the part arrived the packaging was acceptable but the part was not in a corrosion prtective ""wrap"".Thank you for allowing me to express myself. - Carl Johnson"

Cultures based on Fighters and based on magic users who are the superpowers of the fantasy world and are background to a lot of the Known world setting (Karameikos was originally a thyatis colony, Glantri's war with air mages was with aplphatia before coming to Mystara). the boxed set contains information on areas east of the known world, the two big super nations and includes new magic for the Alphatians and griffon riders for thyatis as well as other gazetteer setting info."
1,A big time RIP-OFF!!! Shame to the author and the publisher!,75% of the book is the code - which you get on the CD. That might still be OK if the examples were any good. Buy only if you own a pocket protector and you want to waste some money.
2,Not much insight,"Book presents very rudimentary examples with little insight in how real projects might be created. The book also prints out the code from the examples, which I think has little value and take lots of space."
1,I WISH I COULD GIVE IT A 0 STAR RATING!,Dont even THINK about getting this book! I just wish I'd read the reviews here before I bought it - What a <beeping> waste of money!!!
3,What GIs were up to,A story that is not very plausible. A writing that is shallow and one-dimensional. There certainly are better mystery stories around.
1,Samsonite?,"Samsonite usually puts out great travel items. Not so with these bags. They don't work at all because the plastic sealers fall off - they fell off of all 10 bags for me. I'm too lazy to get a refund, but buyer beware with these - they are a disappointment. One might as well use freezer bags; the result would probably be better!"
3,Not imapressed,The quality of this bracelet is not very good and the snap is very loose. It gets open all the time.
1,This show is about nothing,"""Do not disturb"" is completely unfunny, uninteresting and unitellingent. It is extremely predictable, the jokes are old, used up and just not funny. I give this show 6 episodes, just because the ""star power"" (the litle it has) may actually make it last that long. There is not much to say about this show. 1. It is just not worth it. 2. The actual plot is not clear 3. Who cares?UPDATE: 9/26/2008 Well, the show was canceled after 3 episodes. I guess I overestimated the show, which I still don't know what it was really about..."
2,book,A friend recommended I read it. However it was pretty complicated and deep for me to understand. Took quite along time to get through it.
4,NBN / GYG,"What can I say about this single.Great song coming from Naughty's first album.The beat speaks by itself and remind me of the ""JUICE"" era.Kay Gee defined the sound who paves the way for establishing Naughty as oneof Hip Hop greatest groups.The remixes are good but not better than the album version.If you're a fan you will love.Peace to Kay Gee, Treach and Vinnie."
3,"Good subject, poor execution","I was excited when I found out about this book, because I agree with the author's overall thesis. I really wanted to like the book, but I came away sadly disappointed.Furedi has some interesting ideas, but his writing is needlessly dense and dreary. Granted, this is an academic work, but still -- a good editor could probably bring this book to life. As it stands, however, the overall subject matter is interesting, but the book is almost unreadable.For a much better treatment of essentially the same topic, see ""One Nation Under Therapy"", by Christina Hoff Sommers and Sally Satel."
2,Waste of Money,"I bought these because of their great reviews. I'm kicking myself in the butt for doing so...These glasses are SUPER thin. One came broken when I received it. Amazon was nice enough to reimburse me for the broken glass. Another one broke in my hand while I was washing it...yes, I was being gentle. The glasses look nice and are big but I'd really like a glass that isn't so thin. When I'm paying about $11 a glass, I'm really hoping to at least use them for a few months. Won't be buying them again."
3,*Buy the similar vino grandes in 2-packs instead*,"Just received these from Amazon along with a 2-pack of the nearly identical Spiegelau vino grande glasses. Whereas the vino grandes were individually wrapped in bubble wrap inside the manufacturer's package, these vino vinos were not. No surprise, one of the vino vinos arrived broken. Save time (and spend about the same amount of money) and just get 2 packages of the vino grandes rather than the 4-pack of vino vinos.There also appears to be more variability in the stem-shape of these vino vinos than the vino grandes, but perhaps this can be chalked up to batch variability. My sample size is small.Nice glasses though. The ubiquitous ""seam"" on the stem is much less noticeable than most other glasses I've seen at this price point. Enjoy!"
4,Great example of Burgandy glasses,"Given as a gift to a snobby sommalier, he really liked them.Sadly one was broken in transit and the vendor readily replaced without any issue."
4,A great book on modern day railroading in the United States,"Union Pacific Cheyenne West- Part 1 is a photographic tour along the Union Pacific Railroad in Wyoming and Utah. Wesley Fox is an excellant black and white photographer who has captured the Union Pacific railroad in the harsh country of Wyoming. His sharp photography takes you up close and you can almost feel the trains roaring by. If you love the golden age of steam, then the last chapter will bring back great memories as Fox photographs the Union Pacific's remaining steam locomotives in passenger service. If you like the Union Pacific Railroad and appreciate sharp and well printed black and white photographs, then this a book for you. Part 2, which will cover the Union Pacific west of Ogden, UT to Los Angeles, Oakland and Portland should be available soon."
5,The Ultimate Luther Vandross,"Luther Vandross is one of my favorite Artist. The sound of his vocals are unique. His music tells a story of Love, happiness, and sometimes even sorrow."
5,There is only one Luther,There are few artists that you just need to say their first name and you know who they are. Luther had so many classic romantic songs. This is a must have album for lovers.
4,Luther,This is a must have Grown Folks alum. Luther will relax you or get you in the mood. Good Album
5,It's an must for Luther fans.,"One of the best albums of Luther""s, some of his best songs sung with his unique sound. I can't believe he's gone."
3,I got the MP3 and it was OK,"Unfortunately (my own fault) I didn't read the advert properly and was convinced that I was purchasing the CD, then realized that I had just purchased the MP3 to download the album through iTunes. But again, it was my own misunderstanding!"
3,A lot of instrumental here,"A little more instrumental then I was expecting. I would have liked a little more vocal. If you like elevator music, I think you will enjoy this one."
1,Why use one word when several will do?,Writing style Verbose and clunky. Uses too many modifers. Most likley to improve with time has solid skills of writing.
2,Well-written but...,"I couldn't finish reading the book because I just couldn't believe what she was saying and,at times, she was too dramatic. However, her writing style is fine, she expressed herself well...if the content had been a little different, I would have loved it."
3,This forum is designed to help people choose a book...,"...not to make an opinion on whos guilty or inocent. Have some common sense and find forums for this matter and don't waste valuable space in this webpage...and no Im not racist I AM 100% MEXICAN but a Mexican that knows what ""Review this book"" means.thank you."
3,Nice,"Class Reunion Again is one of the hentai movie that the sex scene is always on the end. It's about the life of x-members of the tennis team at a Junior High School. In the beginning the movie is funny but in the middle is dramatic. The dubbing is good except in the beginning which you cannot hear the words they say. The animation is really cool and the sex scene is a little bit too short. If you want a movie with humor, drama, and sex scene then this is good for you."
1,this particular version is garbage!,"If you're even thinking about possibly picking this up because the price looks great, I urge you to think again! The only good thing that will ever be good about this CD is the price! This is a highly editted and re-aranged setlist that makes absolutely no sense _what _so _ever! If you're looking for a comprehensive version of this wonderful Everly Brothers concert, than Look for the 2CD set released on Warner Brothers/Rhino in 2002. That edition has the complete show from start to finish in beautifully re-mastered sound. Also, look for The DVD ""The Everly Brothers:Reunion Concert (Live At The Royal Albert Hall)"" that was released in 2003 from Imagine Entertainment. With these two products you'll be much better off than buying this aweful CD offered here. Thanks for reading this review. I hope it helps you make a wise and informed perchase. PEACE!"
2,Disappointing,"I'm not sure for whom this grammar is written. It has a usful review of the history and current state of chinese teaching in the US, but it has very little practical information for the teacher. The grammar explanations and examples are overly complex and have almost no pedagological function. The sample sylabi at the back, however, are invaluable."
2,Rehashed mishmash,"The author admits that this is largely a recap of Siegel's 1989 Intoxication. Like a skipping stone, Samorini only knicks the tops off of profound ideas. There's no depth of natural history or chemistry to be found in this short book. To make matters worse, the translation is horrid: the book abounds with typos and other errors that leave me wondering what the heck Samorini really meant."
4,Hunter Downrod,The vendor delivered the part on schedule. Have not installed it yet but it meets my expectation. Don't think there will be a fit-up or functionality problem.
5,Great and Wonderful Book!,"I am the owner of the NR Publishing Co. for which this book comes from. My father is Koko Willis and stepmother is Pali Lee. I personally have more books in stock and will be reprinting more in June 2004. Need a book? email me at taysheart13@hotmail.com, Aloha and continue the support."
3,Mediocre Mythology,"First off the concept of revealing why Loki is the way he is, is great. Too bad it is executed poorly and goes on forever with not much excitement. The only thing that makes this book mediocre is the amazing artwork. If you are a hardcore fan of Thor I say this is a great addition for you, if not stay away."
3,If it cost less than $20 I'd give it 5 stars,"I think all the foundation brushes are overpriced, but I bought this one and it works well. It doesn't absorb/waste as much foundation as a sponge would. Feels awkward at first, compared to dotting your foundation on and spreading it with your fingertips, but you get better at it each time you use it."
3,Only one good track,"This is worth it for the extended album mix, or the ""Corture Mix"" as it is labeled on this CD. It also includes some alternate/added lyrics such as ""you better work...bi+ch"""
1,Not even close,"I purchased this book to use as a study guide for the NYS CST in French. I have taken this test before, and unfortunatley did not pass the first time. First of all, the test is completely in French. This review guide offers all questions in English. Even worse than that, there are major grammatical errors and I found at least five answers in the Key to be incorrect, as a matter of fact, the correct responses were not even offered for several questions. I now feel as if I have worsened my knowledge by studying incorrect information."
2,Do not buy others by same author,Do not waste your time or money thinking that you are getting different exams when you buy 08 and 12 - they are the SAME!!!
4,Wonderful way to start the day,"A great way to start your day! A little joy, a little laughter and you will be armed for your day. If you like this book try also Conversations atthe Girlvile Diner-Finding God in the Hairdos and Hashbrowns. KC"
2,When will I learn,When will I learn that not all kitchen aid appliances are made as well as their stand mixers? To say that this toaster was a disappointment would be an understatement. The toast would not brown evenly or even consistent. In a way I am almost ashamed that I spent this much money for a toaster that could not even toast a slice of bread.Save your money get yourself a Krups.
2,Disappointing,"This book compact in volume covers several WEB application development related topics but does it in a quite superficial manner. It reads like a bunch of articales talking about various tips and tricks but does not give a fundamental understading of the development process with WebSphere. In other words, if you are new to the WebSphere environment I would not recommend to buy this book.The better books I would recommend is the WebSphere V3.5 Handbook"
4,Good resource for some of WebSphere Best practices,Touches many interesting topics but meant to be read with other Redbooks.
3,"Battery is good, but....","Everyone else said they got their battery quickly. Mine took a week to arrive, I don't consider that to be fast, tho. Battery looked ok and works. I did think I was getting 2 batteries because of the photo. I see now that it does not say I would get two, but think photo is misleading."
2,Extremely poor customer service,"When publishers are trying out ways and means to improve service and use Information Technology, Barron's in a world of its own - antiquated technology, rudeness and arrogance. While there is no issues with their editorial content, their customer service is the worst."
3,Buy from Barron's directly,Love Barrons and bought this deal from Amazon and paid $99 for 7 months. If you by Directly from Barrons you can get 1 year of both digital & print for 149.00. Needless to say I am less than impressed with this purchase experience from amazon. I should have done better research so there is not one else to blame but myself. Never again.
4,PLAIN AND SIMPLE,"IF YOU LOVE WHITESNAKE THEN YOU HAVE THESE ALREADY.IF YOU DON'T THEN YOU ARE NOT A FAN OF WHITESNAKEBECAUSE MOST PEOPLE BOUGHT THESE WHEN RONALD REGAN WAS PRESIDENTIF YOU WANT TO GET INTO THE WORLD OF WHITESNAKEBUY THERE 2/DISC GREATEST~HITS COLLECTIONIT IS ALL YOU WILL EVER NEED{ROME,NEW YORK}:HOME OF WOODSTOCK 1999"
3,Good but dated!,I found this a very interesting read but it brought me into another age. the masculine language was one thing but it is also from an age when only those in religious life were concerned about meditation. The second half on meditation itself was helpful in many ways. The world has changed and I wonder what Merton would write today and how he would approach the new wave of consciousness being birthed.Suzanne Ryder
2,spiritual Direction and meditation,This is the first book of its kind that I was disappointed with. I normally take time to digest and look for inspiration or 'spiritual direction' I found it lacking..and actually never finished the book.
2,"She's hot, she's naked, so what?","Bought this for nostalgia's sake as it was one of the first films I ever saw a naked woman in. In retrospect, it's an average attempt by a poor scriptwriter to keep a very pretty woman unclothed for our viewing pleasure, but the plot is pretty infantile. Quality of film transfer from VHS to digital is extremely low quality. Save your money. Jewel Shepard: if you're reading this, I still want you."
1,Very shallow,"I am glad to see that others have found this to be an unsatisfying book. It lacks substance. Here's a random quote: ""Earth is the element of simplicity that forms the core of all our structures. It is the glue that holds it all together when the pieces don't seem quite to fit. Earth makes the ends meet."" Wolfe does not elucidate these comments. They are typical of the whole book: vague statements with little substance behind them. This book is mostly waffle. It lacks intelligent and practical advice on the topics it claims to consider."
1,Fiction and Fantasy,"Another book about so-called ""Celtic Faerie Craft & DruidicMagic."" Don't waste your money. Nothing but fabrications,innaccuracy, fantasy, and bogus claims. If you want toknow about real Celtic and Druid religion, visit yourlibrary and find a book written by someone who knows whatthey are talking about."
1,What is this crap? Native American Druids????,"This book makes me very ashamed to have bought it. It had a promising title (like the first from this author), but once you get into it, gag me!! Its the worst piece of garbage I have had the misfortune to buy and read so far. I have been studying the Celtic Religions for nearly three years, and this one takes the cake in imagination and falsehoods."
1,Horrible,"This is by far the most horrible piece of crap I have ever had the nerve to read. I'm sorry I just wish I hadnt bought the book. Its a bunch of fantasy and dreams. I have been studying Celtic magick for a while now and this is everything but celtic, personally I dont see any magick in it what so ever. I urge you do not waste your money, take the money for this book and go buy some liver pate, it would probably leave a better taste in your mouth after you were done with it too."
1,What a disappointment,I could not believe the introduction to this book! What nonsense! Doesn't Miss Wolfe realize that maybe some people reading this book are of Irish descent and know what Tara and the weather patterns of Ireland are? I have studied Celtic archaeology and NONE of it unfolded in the way she suggests. My review: don't bother!
1,This Book Is Terrible And Don't Waste Your Money!,"When I bought this book at Borders I thought it was going to teach me about faerie magic and druids and celtic magic. Boy, was I wrong! Basically the whole book is guided imagery meanign meditations. I suggest you should look online for meditations rather than pay for this book. I made a HUGE mistake buying this book and you will to if you buy it."
1,Basically made-up,"Another badly-researched fantasy. Wolfe may understand the principles of modern, Neopagan magic (she seems to) but she clearly doesn't understand the basics of Celtic Pagan symbolism. Misleading and innacurate."
5,I CAN IDENTIFY SIMILIAR LIFE/SOUL WORK,I ENJOYED THE BOOK AND HAVE READ OTHERS. THE BOOKS HAVE BEEN PASSED ON TO OTHERS AND HELP A GROUP OF WOMEN IN THEIR PASSAGE OF LIFE. IT HAS BEEN QUITE INSIRING TO ME TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHERS WITH SIMILAR LIVES....
5,AWESOME!,"This piece of cd is awesome,it surely has a cool melodictracks.i'm a fan of useless id so i think the band reallyrocks!cool songs like another bad taste,presents,oh my gourdand also no time for me to be a teen.buy it!u guys wont regret it!"
4,we enjoyed it,"We watched the DVD with our daughters (8 and 10), who liked the movie and the story, but at some times had trouble following it. The topic of the meaning of life seemed a little over there heads. Other than that, they (and we) had a good time - they liked both the boy and the girl in the movie very much. We might watch it again in two year's time!"
4,Nice!,"Nice shorts, nice fit, nice looking, nice shipping, everything about this product was just as described, will buy again from this seller, thank you very very much, sincerely, Mario"
3,"An important book, but not strictly Perkins","If it were not for this edition of Perkins's seminal manual for preachers we would have to find it in archives and rare book rooms. Having it available in any form is better than the alternative.However, it is important to realize that this is not, strictly speaking, Perkins's text. It is a kind of translation into more recent English idiom, and like all translations it loses both the character and some of the precision of the original.As valuable as this edition is, a critical edition of the original Latin and vernacular texts would be even more welcome."
2,Ex libris (pun intended),"The prose of The Sibyl in Her Grave is excellent, and the book contains a lot of wit and understated humor.However, the plot has more coincidences than a novel by Dickens. A more serious problem with the plot cannot be discussed without spoiling too much of the book for those who have not read it.The author indulges her hostility to men. The male characters are dolts or sex perverts or both. They have names like Ragwort and Cantrip.Although this book may be engaging at first, ultimately it is tedious and unsatisfying."
5,"Worth reading, and rereading","Ready Made Family and Runaway Alice are the type of books you read as a child, and remember as an adult, I recently reread Ready Made Family and I enjoyed it just as much.Hedy and her brother and sister have been bounced around by their aunts, uncles, cousins and other family members until they no longer trust that anything good will ever happen to them, learning to be a family and for Hedy to just be a kid takes time.Read it if you can find it."
2,not what i expected,THIS Is not what i expected at all! i thought there would b all the videos of her OWN songs...but there are only one or two videos of her OWN songs in this dvd collection most of them are just SOME videos she was featured in or just made guest spot appearances on (meaning she didnt even rap) i.e. the sock it 2 me video with missy elliot.....im VERY dissapointed and during the beginning of each video in the dvd there is a number and the companys name that is very annoying that appears on the screen...also there are no outtakes or whatever as mentioned as the previous reviewer..its just videos and they are not that good quality either..... very dissapointed.
4,Itzz Hot! OHHH KIM!,"Yo, if ya like hard core, and NOTORIOUS KIM, than this is da video for ya. She is hot, wild, and sexy. Great action, costumes, and commentary. It a for sure must have for any die hard Lil Kim Fan. Peep it!"
1,"The Worst, an INSULT to Lil Kim","I bought this for my friend as a birthday gift last year, he's the BIGGEST Lil Kim fan ever, and I have to say that this was the worst present he got. We were both very disapointed with this product. There is not much to it, just a few video clips, and theres ads all through the whole thing. This was a waste of my [money]:("
4,Good vid of Kim.,"I haven't gotten this yet, but from what I've heard it's a very good concert video with Lil' Kim performing her hits. The best Lil' Kim stuff is the song on Urban Renewal, though!~~~~Lil' Kim & Phil Collins 4 Ever~~~~~~~~"
5,One of FZ best albums,"Frank Zappa was arguably the most original composer of the modern-age. No musician has anything on him. All virtuosos and composers today only wish they have one-tenth the creativity and talent Frank Zappa did. What I respect the most about Frank Zappa was that he dared to investigate the limits and boundaries of music more than anyone before him or since. However, I never really thought of him as an expert in writing lyrics. I thought he was a much better musician and composer than he was a song writer.That being said, One Size Fits All is one of the best lyric albums Frank made in my opinion. The album is great from start to finish. I highly recommend ANY Frank Zappa album over 99% of music released since 2000 and definitely more so than music you hear on MTV or Top 40."
5,"One of the best in a long, prolific career","Definitely one of the best discs in a long, wide and varied career. Frank takes one of his best bands, including George Duke, Napoleon Murphy Brock and Ruth Underwood, and guides them through a dizzying array of rock, jazz, fusion and other hybrids. ""Inca Roads,"" ""Sofa #1"" and ""Andy"" are among his best songs ever. The presense of Frank's teenage hero, Johnny ""Guitar"" Watson, is another plus. Definitely one of the most crucial discs in FZ's catalog. Essential! Get it!"
5,The best,"About once a year I take this album out for another round of listening, and am consistently staggered by just how good it is. The catchy melodies made it accessible early on, while the complexity makes it even more rewarding after the (at least) 100th listen. The Po-jama People guitar solo mimics an annoying person yammering away in your ear. The spacy ambience and George Duke's semi-falsetto vocals lend a vibe to Inca Roads just like its title. The phrase ""pondered the significance of short person behavior in pedal-depressed pan-chromatic resonance, and other highly ambient domains"" is used to express puzzlement at how short people can press the pedals on a panio. Elegantly structured pieces like Sofa, with many variations on the theme and perfect-sounding counterpoints, are there as well. It is simply, IMHO, the greatest single rock or rock-related album ever produced. I'll never tire of listening to it."
5,Posibly the most Well-Rounded Zappa Album Ever,"Ever since i was about three years old, i have loved this CD. My father was a big zappa fan and so am i. One Size Fits All is my favorite album, and quite possible the best example to set forth to people who are wanting to try somthing a little unusual. ""Inca Roads"" is a great example of jazz-rock twith some great marimba and xylophone playing with Zappa on guitar. the great use of satire in Po-Jama People and Florintine Pogen make this album even better.BUY THIS CD IS YOU WOULD LIKE TO GET HOOKED ON MUSIC THAT IS INTERESTING, INTELLEGENT, AND DIVERSE"
4,One of Frank's best studio,"This is an album you could hand someone who asks you about Frank Zappa's music and say ""This pretty much covers it."" Then you'll be buying another or escorting them to the store as they buy their own copy.""Inca Roads"" is worth the price of the disc itself, but this has a little of Frank's trademark wit (""Can't Afford No Shoes"", ""San Ber'dino"") and trademark 'molten gold' guitar work (solo to ""Inca Roads"", ""Po-jama People"") and some outright offbeat arrangement (read:Weirdness) (""Andy"", ""Evelyn, A Modified Dog"").This is a cornerstone album in my Zappa, along with Hot Rats and Zoot Allures. If you like this, this band is on Roxy and Elsewhere and You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore 2, both very good live sets worth investigating."
3,"Not Lisa's best, by any means","I bought this album in eager anticipation, having been highly impressed with her earlier release 'Back To Earth', which was quirky, imaginative and fun. However, this one is quite disappointing. It's all too-much-the-same in style and comes across as a bit of a commercial 'Part 2' to cash in on her reputation. And there are some musical faux pas that just plain grate - ""Love For Sale"" done at a cracking swing pace which makes it's poignant lyrics sound trite; Bjork's wonderful ""It's Oh So Quiet"" without the shout chorus which would normally give it 'bite'. And the other version of ""It's Oh So Quiet"" on the album sounds almost identical, so one wonders why it was even included.Having said that, she does redeem herself a little with her choice of repertoire. It's great to hear such standards as ""Lush Life"", ""But Not For Me"" and ""Cry Me A River"", even if the treatment is fairly uninspiring.Satisfactory background music, but not much more than that."
3,Disappointing but readable ***spoilers*****,"*****Warning...Spoiler alert******I came to this book knowing absolutely nothing about Robert Durst. ""The Strange Disappearance of Kathie Durst"" in the title got my curiosity. I enjoyed the book except that I didnt realize that it was written before Durst was tried for the murder of Morris Black and therefore it left me hanging at the end. I had to go to courttv. com and read up on the case and how it ended or rather didnt end.Overall, this book was not bad even though at times I felt I was reading a long magazine article. The editing could have been a lot better and the ending seemed to me like an abrupt halt.There may be other books out there on this case which would be more up to date and provide more detail."
3,"Murder, A passtime for the rich & famous","Can money buy murder? Not only can it buy murder, it can buy serial murder. Great insight by Birkbeck through his analytical study of a real estate empire, a family and murders. The final outcome is left up to the reader.This book gives the reader a true insight in another facet of our amoral society."
5,A great book!,"This is a great trivia book, and a fun family game. I keep a copy with me wherever I go-- it's great for long car trips and family outings. Mr. Lloyd's wit, wisdom and research pervades every page. And the illustrations are fantastic. He is truly a man among mice, or something like that... And I bet he makes an awesome chicken tetrazzini! We are looking forward to the next 49 states!"
3,Lonely Planet China,"This is the latest issue of LP China. The section on Tibet is not always up-to-date, spec. restaurant recommendations in Lhasa and Beijing. (We had the worst Peking Duck in Beijing EVER in the restaurant most highly recommended by LP.) The section on the history of Tibet is too skimpy."
4,Decent coverage,"I'm off to work in Beijing in September and before my contract starts a friend and I are planning on seeing 'some' of China. It's great to see Lonely Planet releasing this updated edition when so many other travel series seem content offering two or three year old information.This 2007 version has bountiful knowledge, mesmerising photos and up to date costs and information throughout China proper and outlying regions.I've normally been a Rough Guide user but glad to see L.P has improved its staple with this China-logue and now my friend and I are all set (just to about) to take on this sizeable journey.Recommended, just make sure you have strong shoulders if you decide to take the book with you. It's BIG!"
2,too big too small,"the book is too big... China is a big country, there should be a separate book for each region covering it more in depth. Also due to this, the authors have selected a tiny font making it quite hard and unpleasant to read.The book is also lacking useful hints which I find in the french equivalent ""le guide du routard"" for french speakers."
2,Did the authors actually go?,"I used this book only in Beijing and Shanghai, so I can only vouch for those two sections. The maps of Beijing were great, when they were there. Because the book appears not to have been copy edited, there are lots of references to more detailed maps there are not actually in the book.Also, the Beijing section doesn't include some of the most interesting areas for tourists to visit. It seems like someone just did a google search on Beijing and listed the first few things that come up, regardless of their interest or relevance to tourists. A major park walking distance to the forbidden city surrounded by cafes, museums and excellent souvenir shops is simply not listed.Shanghai was a little better.It is a good book for dreaming though. I am keeping my copy so I can plan ahead for next trip. Before I actually go though I will be buying a different book."
2,Don't be fooled. This is just the 7th edition,"I had been anticipating the release of LP¡s China 8th edition hoping it would fix the errors in the 7th edition and fill out the areas that were weak in the 7th edition. Guess what, there is NOTHING new in the 8th edition. The same errors from the 7th edition have been reproduced in full even though anyone who has spent more then a month in China in the last five years will know how laughably inaccurate the book is in places. It¡s still an OK guide but it¡s terribly out of date and it is not only misleading but dishonest for them to call this an 8th edition. It is nothing more then a rerun of a previous edition."
3,China,"Good to get you started but just as China is, the book is also quite hard to navigate, as chapters are focused by Province. Would be good to have a shoestring guide instead. Still, I wouldn't have been without it!! Its quite cumbersome but when in big cities I would cut out the relevant pages and take them alone out and about with me."
1,Complete Crap,"This book is so bad. If I could give it 0 stars believe me, I would. Many of the things listed in this book no longer exist. I went to one city and all 4 places listed in the LP as budget accomodations were no longer in business. Maps were incorrect. Attractions were listed with one address and placed elsewhere (and incorrectly) on the map. It would help greatly of it had more Chinese of the locations listed so you can show cab drivers. I finally gave up, chucked it into the trash and continued my 4 month trip through Asia without consulting any guidebook and had a much nicer time. Down with the Lonely Liar! You don't need a guide book. Just talk to other travelers."
2,Old edition - now out of date,"Amazing that Amazon is still selling the old edition. The new one came out in May, 2009 - readily available (at full price) from the Lonely Planet website."
2,Beware the book,"To echo the words of other readers, this is disappointing and out of date.On the second point, bear in mind that many prices have increased (sometimes more than doubled) since this book was published.On the first, try to ignore almost every recommendation on accomodation and food that the guidebook makes. In many locations the majority of listed restaurants are Western and those that are Chinese are poor quality, high priced and seem to be recommended only for having an English menu. Go somewhere else, point, go for pot-luck or learn a little Chinese before you go and you'll enjoy everything much more."
4,ULTIMATE SUMMER 2000 CLUB ANTHEM,"Since I first started hearing this song in the clubs in May, it has quickly established itself as a ""summer anthem"". It is rather simplistic in theory, a mass chant (everyone knows the oh oh oh oh oh) over a trancy-house beat and the sparse vocal sample (zombie...zombie...zombie nation). If you are a dance music fan, how could you NOT like this song. I guarantee that 10 years from now, when this song is a ""dance classic"", it will recall good memories from the summer of 2000!"
5,Fantastic moody trance song!,"This is a great trance song, its still played quite often 5 years after its released. It spent 2 weeks at #2 in the UK charts only stopped by the cheesy Mariah Carey & Westlife duet - ROBBED! Anyway get this, its an anthem for all clubbers!"
4,Boring @ times,"-ReadersZombie Nation is a cool song. But in one part, they do the same thing over and over. But the D.J. put's extra effects in the back. However, I do recommend this CD&song.-Veronica"
3,A Modicum of Rhythm Please!,"Take a listen to the opening horn call on the sample of the Strauss #1. Try to beat time to it. Should it be free? Can it be stretched here and there? Yes, but does it even resemble the actual rhythm? Decide for your self. Is this characteristic of modern German interpretation? Experience a note by note existential experience in rhythm. I guess this is what passes for sophisticated musicianship these days."
2,Some Came Running,"Another lumbering Jones' book that takes the reader on a tortuous journey through the lives of unfortunates while attempting to illuminate the lasting mental and emotional effects of war. Amazingly, all of Jones' books made it to the big screen (except Whistle), and in all cases the screen writing adaptations were far superior to Jones' original projects. By far the best screen adaptation was The Thin Red Line, which, fortunately, can't even be recognized as being inspired by Jones' laborious novel."
3,"Good...as always, you can see Jones in his characters","I was quite surprised to see that this book was un-reviewed. Jones' lead character in some ways must be him...young man returning to his Illinois small-town home from the war.It certainly appears to me that his writer's colony patron is here in some part.His anger at the less than wholesome undercurrents in his home town come through strongly.The characters are quite vivid, especially 'Bama. and the dialogue is good.I vote this one in Jones' upper tier, but definitely below his best."
1,Where are your facts?,"After reading the book, I didn't see any substantiated facts based on genuine empirical data gathered from the results of the Japanese bombings in 1945 or the Bimini atoll testing throughout the 40's and 50's."
4,"Bad theory, good result","The basic hypothesis of this book (that Lucan made his way to India and lived as a recluse under the name of Barry Halpin) was shown to be incorrect soon after its publication. But for a number of reasons this book is still well worth reading.It provides a well-written account of the crime and its aftermath and the effect which Lucan's status had on the investigation. It gives a fascinating and contrasting view into the life of people on the fringes of society in Goa in the 1970s, harmless, inconsequential souls aside from their unwitting participation in this case of mistaken identity. And it serves as an interesting example of how a substantial body of evidence, gathered in earnest, can still yield a totally wrong conclusion. Might have rated 5 stars if the theory was right."
4,Good with practice,"Read the reviews on this product and decided to give it a try. Ceiling in living room is 23 feet high with recessed thermal canned flood lights. This took plenty of practice to get it right and I only lost one of 6 floods I was replacing. If you have patience, the ability to balance an object on the end of a long pole while aiming for a ""bullseye"" without losing your temper, go for it. Plan on sacrificing a bulb or two in the learning process.All in all, I am happy with the purchase. If I didn't have super long life bulbs and I had to use it monthly...I'd have more of opportunity to perfect my skill. Did I mention you will need to practice?"
1,Waste of Money,"Absolutely a waste of money busted first bulb i tried to take out. Will not hold on any type of bulb, another piece from China"
5,Works Just As Described!,"I was skeptical, but this is a great product. Suction design requires smooth bulb surface, so will not work with new LED bulbs with slotted face.Tips(1): before use (especially outdoors), clean the old bulb surface with a dampened rag ball mounted on the end of your extenstion pole. I used two old tube socks, one wrapped around the pole end to provide a soft cushion, and another slipped over the end, binding this combo to the pole with a nylon tie wrap. Spritz the ball-end with Windex, then swab the dust & debris from the old light by twirling the pole clockwise.(2) Coat the new bulb's threads with ""Anti-seize"" lube (available at auto supply shops) to help ensure easy extraction at next change out."
1,Opps! My Mistake,"I couldn't get these attachments to work properly. I had to go out and buy a bulb grabber. For me, I'll never use these again, they are in the trash. I put the large one on my pole to change the light bulbs in my 16' ceiling. The cup didn't stay attached to the bulb, the bulb fell and I was cleaning up glass for the next twenty minutes. One the second one I pushed too hard and ended up breaking the bulb. It just didn't work for me."
2,Dangerous!!!,"I screwed this onto the handle of our broom- and thought- hey awesome! i just saved $20 by not having to buy the mr longarm pole. I did manage to change a flood light and a standard bulb from our vaulted ceiling's recessed lighting. HOWEVER- when you do finally get the suction cups to stick onto the bulb- the act of turning the stick- to turn the bulb out of the socket- can also break the suction- leading to bulbs dropping out of the ceiling. (thank god i had the shower door closed - otherwise i would have been picking glass shards out of my shins) i guess I could take a lamp shade frame and secure a net or pillowcase - then attach it to the base of the suction cup- to catch the bulbs next time... or possibly put a glue dot in the suction cup for taking the burned out bulb down...i gave this product 1 star because that's the minimum, and an extra star because i did change a few light bulbs with it."
2,Bare bones,"This is the first book I've read on the Persian Wars, and while the book does give a relatively continuous narrative of the conflict, it seems to be pretty much a bare bones retelling of Herodotus's history. The additional analysis seems weak, and is often little more than restatements of obvious points. Some of the history is glossed over, while some random and extraneous facts are given, without much reason that I could find. Maps are helpful but often don't have all the geographic landmarks that are mentioned in the text, which limits their usefulness. Numerous grammatical mistakes further eroded my confidence in the rigor of the book. There's got to be much better stuff out there than this."
3,A fisrt for everything,"The perfect gift right? Well I gave it to my girlfriend as a present and 10 days later the top cracked off and it fell off the necklace. The reason I have not put a lower rating is because I got a call about it a few days later offering a refund or exchange. By then I had already ordered another pendant, but she said it was the first time that has ever happened. I could maybe believe that but I still feel people need to know that at least one did break."
1,Does not fit properly. Poor Design.,"Honda Civic car thefts are on the rise where I live. So I ordered this from Amazon. I tried on my two cars and determined that it does not fit either. The air bag theft protection plate is supposed to slide underneath the club gripping the wheel. But, most steering wheels are too thick for this to happen. I tried to slide the plate over the grip, but there is no room for that either. So, basically I wasted 65 dollars for a useless gadget. I have no idea what to do with. In the process of opening I destroyed the packaging, so I am not sure if Amazon will take it back or not. In any case, be warned. This gadget does not work at all; at least for the Honda Civic and my other car."
1,Lock is stuck on my steering wheel,"This steering wheel lock has performed sufficiently over a few years in my Toyota Camry. Just recently, however, the locking mechanism became stuck: the key turned in the lock just fine, but the actual moving parts of the lock were stuck, and the lock is now stuck on my steering wheel. The customer service line on the manufacturer's website has been disconnected, so I have been unable to contact ABA regarding this highly irritating malfunction. I had to pay a locksmith to grind the lock off of my steering wheel. This product is not recommended!"
3,"okay, but could be better","this product works great for any vehicle as long as it fits your steering wheel. the downsides of this are that it's heavy, kind of clunky in two pieces, and it also makes an indentation in the steering wheel where the two pieces meet. the indentation could lead to tearing of the wheel itself, depending on what type of material the wheel is made out of."
5,Better than all the rest,"Even though I have a great alarm on my '90 BMW 535i, more is better. All of the other steering wheel immobilizers have youtube videos of jr high kids picking their locks in seconds. No one seems to have an answer for Viper's product.Fits nicely snug and protects the airbag. Easy to put on and is no problem to remove - with the key. It could be better only if it had a flashing led on the handle for ++ visibility."
5,I feel safe,I own a 97 Honda Civic DX and it fits perfectly. I had my airbags stolen and did not want it to happen again. This lock is VERY Secure and protects the driver's side airbag. I feel it is a huge deterent against this crime. I also had an alarm installed and I feel very safe.
5,A great quick game!,"This is a fun game that can be used exactly as instructed with each person taking turns putting in a sword, or the kids can be asked to do something each turn such as ""count to ten then put in a sword"" or answering a question about something they learned, so that it can be a reinforcement for education as well. When used in the traditional way its a fast game that is lots of fun, and as a busy mom it's great to have games that can be played together with my kids in under 5 minutes between cooking suppers and giving baths!! As a reinforcer I have found it highly effective because the kids are anxious to see the pirate pop out. It is so far holding up nicely. I have noticed that after the pirate pops up, it is better to remove all the swords before pushing the pirate's button back down inside the barrel. In closing, this is a great game, the kids love the swords and the excitement of a flying pirate and I would recommend it!"
1,Has potential but does not work properly.,"My son was very excited to get this game. The instructions were not clear but it is easily figured out. The problem is the instructions state that the game resets each time the pirate is pushed down. This does not happen. It is easy to figure out which slot will release the pirate. This game will not prove to be a challenge as most kids listed under the recommended age will be able to remember which slot makes the pirate pop. However, the swords are sturdy and the game is cute. Just need the product to work as intended."
4,Great fun,"this toy rocks. my kids (4 & 1.5) love it. the swords come on this plastic rack thing and you have to pop them off and it leaves sharp points, i just sanded them. it also comes with a random blue plastic thing to set the barrel on, i threw that away. you have to hold the barrel when putting the sword in or the barrel tips over. i prefer toys that are crafted well and mainly not plastic, i bought this one because of the fun factor. a friend told me about it, and it is fun! i also threw away the stickers since i read that they fall off anyway, and put the swords in a little canvas bag to try and curb the plastic issue and it's great, worth it for the fun factor. also it's easy, my 1.5 year old daughter gets the game."
4,Great for young kids,"Received as a gift after putting this on the wishlist for my youngest, a 2 1/2 year-old boy. This is a very simple game that doesn't require a lot of skill or patience. It goes quick and that is good enough for his short attention span. Even my oldest, a 6 year-old boy has enjoyed playing a few rounds with his younger brother. It teaches taking turns, the very basic first skill of game playing. I like it as it easy to set up, store and makes for a quick game before bedtime."
3,Cute Game,"Its a cute game. not very challenging, but it will teach the importance of taking turns and there is a bit of anticipation and excitement as to whether you will be the one leaving the game."
3,"Good overall, but not great","Got this for my nearly 3-year-old for the holidays this year. When we opened it and first played it I thought it was the dumbest thing. BUT -- he liked it and asked to play it multiple times. So there ya go! However, after a week, he hasn't expressed much interest in playing with it. The game is pretty cheaply made and light, so you need to hold the barrel with one hand while pulling or putting in the swords with the other. Also, there are no extra swords provided, so if you lose one you'll have to reuse a sword already put into the barrel to finish the game (potentially). Lastly, my son is scared of the pirate who pops out, so we put in a smaller toy to pop up. Overall, it's a good little game -- but not great."
2,Horrible toy!,"Got this for my 6 yr old son last Christmas. The toy had good reviews and I thought it might be fun. While the concept was great, once you find out which slot triggers the head to pop up, it is no longer any fun. Adults will find it after 1 or 2 games which is ok, but my son figured it out the first day he played with it. Needless to say, the toy made its way to the donation pile of our local Salavation Army withing a few weeks after Christmas!!"
2,"fun for laughs, but not a surprise every time","This game is funny and my 4 year old likes to work on sticking the colored swords in. The laughs and jumps when the pirate pops up. But unless you cleverly turn the barrel, the same two slots make the pirate jump every time. The first few times we played it, it changed slots, but after about 5 times, its the same old slot that triggers the pop. But just a quick turn on the barrel, and they never know the difference. Not worth the money though, if you ask me."
3,Easy to play,We gave this game to our five year old grandson for Christmas. He loved it the first couple of times we played it but soon figured out which sword to pull to pop up the pirate. He quickly became bored with it after that. It seems like a sturdy game and the pieces aren't too small. The five year old has a baby brother so I was a little concerned about the swords but they're larger than I expected.
4,Fun game,"My three year old loves this game. He gets so excited that he doesn't want to wait his turn, so the game is teaching him to have a little patience. I wish the barrel was attached to the base and a little heavier with a non-slip bottom so we wouldn't have to hold it down every time someone puts a sword in. The pirate didn't pop out a few times, but we just told my son that the pirate won that time. Overall its a fun game for little ones."
3,Okay for very young kids,"I bought this game for my 3 year old, who needed a easy game that was still fun enough for her 6 year old sister to play too. It was definitely easy- no reading, memory, etc required. Good for parents too, because it doesn't take too long to play. My 6 year old enjoyed it, but we only made it through 2 games before she was tired of it. It would be really nice if there were alternate instructions to make it a little more difficult for older players. The first time we played, we were a little confused on how the pirate went in. The instructions said to twist the pirate's head in there but we weren't sure if he was in there good enough because his head was just kind of wobbling around. Apparently that is the way it is supposed to be though because it worked fine. I would recommend this game for the very young ones but definitely not for anyone over 5."
4,"Fun, quick game!","I bought this game for my sons 4th birthday. He loves pirates! We have played it atleast 100 time and counting. My boys can play it alone or with a parent. It is a game that goes fairly fast, so they do not get bored with it."
3,Pop Up Pirate,"Received the box terribly damaged appears in shipping (product inside was not damaged) Tried to contact seller to get a replacement before Christmas-as it was a gift. No phone number on invoice, no phone number on website. No return email. Poor customer service. Had to juggle gifts, as the box was so damaged I couldn't give it."
5,GREAT game!,We bought this for our 3 year old son and the whole family loves it! Its very fun and simple for smaller kids.
1,not recomended,"Bought it for my 3 year old. He knows his colors and how to take turns so no educational value beyond that. Boring, not much fun at all. Lots of small parts (swords) to find around the house..."
4,"My 3 year old son loves it, BUT...","It would be better if the barrel was attached to the bottom. I have to hold it while he puts the swords in, otherwise, it would fall over. I think I am going to just glue it down."
3,No Storage for the Swords,"My three-year-old daughter really enjoys this game, and it operates as described. ~However~ there is no place to store the 10,000 swords between uses, so the swords wind up all over the house. We had to put them in a baggie and placed the game somewhere the kids have to ask for it, but it's still cumbersome.Fun game but this was a pretty big oversight. There are a lot of swords."
4,Fun for little ones,"I am a Speech Language Pathologist and I use this toy during group and individual therapy. You get blue, yellow, green, and red swords. If you put the sword in the wrong hole the pirate pops out. My kids actually want it to pop out so that person is the winner. I have had mine for 2 years and the kids enjoy playing this game and often beg to play it.Pros: minimal setup time, easy to learn, exciting when pirate pops out, and can be used to learn primary colors and turn taking.Cons: If you touch the pirate once he is set he may not pop out, Someone has to hold the barrell when putting in the swords, some kids have difficulty pushing the swords all the way in."
4,Pop-Up Pirate game,"We play this game with our 5-year-old son and 2.5-year-old daughter. They both love to play it although it is a little difficult for our daughter to push the swords all the way in the barrel. It didn't take long for our son to figure out that when starting a new round, if you put a sword in the slot that made the pirate pop out the last round, he will pop out again. The barrel doesn't stay on the stand that comes with the game very well, but it does not matter too much. This is a fun game for us to play as a family."
2,O.K. .. Just ok tho',"Game is a really great IDEA, but so POORLY made. You have to hold the pirate down to push the swords in. Kids can't just stick a sword in, it will tip right off the base. My son does like to play this, it's just a pain to play. Not a favourite. I would NOT buy this again."
1,Not worth the money,I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old son for Christmas. There is a huge problem...inserting the sword in the same space pops the pirate each time. I have already returned one of the games to the store and the second one does the same thing.
1,"Same slot pops pirate, not random as it states on box",We got this as a gift for Christmas for our 3 and 5 yr old boys. The game is exciting and fun but after playing it 3-4 times we all figured out which slot pops the pirate. The box says that there is a mechanism that randomly select the slot out of all the slots which will probably make it fun but it is useless when everyone knows the answer. Returned for a replacement but the same exact deal with the new one that came which is a sign that this product is not made well from the get go. Stay away from this product.
1,Disappointed Nana,"I recently purchased this toy for my grandson's birthday. I read the many reviews about it first and it sounded like fun. We were unable to get the pirate to lock into position in the barrel. Therefore, the game was/is useless. He was so disappointed. I won't be purchasing anymore games online. I'll stick to buying them in stores where they are much more easily exchanged."
3,Pop up Pirate,My 4 year old grandson likes to play the game. He won't play it long. He will usually play one game and he is done. But I think he would play it once a day if given the opportunity. Transaction went smoothly and was shipped on time!
3,poorly executed,"Fun concept, but the execution could be better. The pirate doesn't always pop up when a sword is inserted into the correct slot, plus you can feel the resistance when you choose the right slot, which detracts from the surprise factor. My kids played it a few times and after being consistently disappointed in it haven't gone back to it again."
2,Not that great,"Not thrilled by this game. I was hoping that it would be more challenging than it is, and it is pretty cheaply made."
4,POP UP PIRATES,It was a cute game. My grandsons enjoyed playing it. I would recommend it for children to age 2 to 4.
5,Great game,I got this game for my 2 1/2 year old for Xmas. Great game my 4 1/2 year old loves it also. It's a fast moving game takes less than 5 mins for a round. Very fun! Highly recommend it!
4,"Great fun, but...","I own this game and all 4 of the grandchildren love it, ages 3-9. I ordered another one for the 3 year old for Christmas, but it came without a pirate. Amazon couldn't fix this, and now the toy is double the price I paid in October. Amazon did issue a refund, but all we want for Christmas is a pirate."
2,Fun for really little ones,It's been a couple years since we owned this toy but I thought it was worth mentioning what I know about it. When we had this toy we had two boys 5 and 4. They loved to play the game and used it quite a bit for a couple months. But after awhile they figured out which spot would make the pirate jump up and then it lost all use. So depending on how observant your kids are you might have limited play time. I do kinda wish I still had it because now I have a new set of little ones that would enjoy it...but I wouldn't buy it again.
1,Pirate pop up,Pirate does not pop up unless swords are put in exactly. With younger children this is a definate deterant of fun. The pop up pirate does not sit appropriately in barrel leading one to beleive it's not in there properly. Also the pop up pirate should have been made of soft plastic like toddler blocks as getting hit with a hard piece of plastic isn't fun. Cute ideal bad design.
2,Could have chosen something different,"It did not work with my little one, he prefers to play with something different.I think that it has so many little swords to put in that it takes a while to see the pirate pop ....."
1,"Didn't work, even when new","We just received this as a gift, and fresh out of the box, it was broken. The pirate part is loose, so it doesn't sink down into the barrel enough to let it pop out, like it's supposed to. I tried pushing hard, twisting it, but nothing worked. Based on the other reviews, it doesn't seem like it would have been that fun even if it had worked. Don't waste your money on this one!"
4,Lots of fun,I bought this for my four year old daughter and we have lots of fun playing with it. I would recommend this for anyone with kids as a fun easy game to understand.
2,"they work as designed most of the time, but build quility is lacking","When these were actually in use on my bike they worked great; the problem came when you wanted to take them off and disable the light to conserve batteries. The insides are loosely held together and you'll have it come apart on more than one occasion, and once that happens the motion sensor works very spottily and will sometimes turn off mid-ride until you pop it open and reassemble it. There are better quality valve lights to be found in the same price range."
4,extra visibility does not hurt,"I bought these only because of an event that a group of us were doing. A group of us (friends, family and their kids) set up a night time bikeride with a bon fire at the end. I bought a bunch of these to attach to the tires of all the kids bikes. These worked great, exception of when we stopped for too long. You see these are motion activated and when it's not moving it stops blinking after a couple of minutes. I suggest getting these for nighttime rides. Any and all extra visibility helps. Only reason why I gave it a four was that one of the bulbs did not work."
3,"Clip is okay, but it came with my Motorola i90c","It was not necessary to buy this clip separately from my Motorola i90c phone, It comes with the phone!"
4,Cool clip!,"PROS: Came with the phone, works well to hold the phone easily accessible. Phone goes on and comes off with ease, never had a problem with the phone randomly falling off during normal daily activities. Has the ability to rotate the phone through 180 degrees so the phone can lay horizontal or vertical on your belt.CONS: Tends to hold your phone out so that it may snag on things. Mine snagged the seatbelt and broke. Cheap to replace, however, especially at the price."
3,"Holds phone well, but . . .","This clip came with my i90C phone, so I suppose one would buy this item only if the original was lost or broken. The holster holds the phone securely, but there are two flaws:1. It doesn't offer as much protection from scratches and moisture as leather/neoprene type holsters.2. Worse--I cannot see the exterior display without removing the phone from the holster."
2,Too detailed and descriptive,"This probably was this professor's dissertation for his Phd. because it reads like one. It starts out VERY good but then it draggggggggggggggggs on and on. And the rapist was never ""lynched"", he was shot and thrown in a river. He wasn't hung from a tree. Good read if you like liberal nonsense."
5,The Right Fragrance,"I have been using Revlon's Ciara 200 for the past 20 years. It is the perfect fragrance to last all day and not be overwhelming. I have received compliments from both men and women about the fragrance I wear. I have been approached about the scent in the grocery line, in my graduate classes, and of course by my suitors. I am extremely allergic to many scents, but Ciara 200 has been the right fragrance for me since I am not allergic to it. Thank you Amazon for selling the 200. I have only been able to find the 80 and 100 in my city and they have not been as pleasing to me."
5,Ciara,"Ciara is the most wonderful scent. It's very romantic and feminine. When I wear it, I get more compliments than when I wear any other scent. Therefore, I have worn it for 25 years. An application lasts too, especially the 200% strength. This is my favorite of all colognes. It's even better than the high priced colognes I have tried."
5,Ciara Perfume,"The Ciara perfume I ordered is excellent quality, and it arrived within 4 days of my purchase date. I am very happy with my order from Amazon."
5,Ciara perfume,"I absolutely loved,loved,loved this purchase. This perfume is my favorite but only bought once or twice because of the price at the stores. I am verrrrrrrrrry pleased with it. Thank you very much,Carmella"
4,Inexpensive and Nice,"This scent is strong and long lasting, In fact it's so strong--even though I'm not even half way through the bottle--I've grown almost tired of it. But when I spray it the next day, I question why I didn't do so sooner. This perfume is tricky, it smells good but it's way strong. I'm liking Juicy Couture a bit more. Try that one out if your looking for something ... juicy. lol. This is more of a classic scent. And AAA rocks, their prices do too."
3,Not Their Best Album,"I like Toto's first album, but feel that ""Hyrdra"" just doesn't match up to it. The songs just don't leave much of an impression. ""99"" is the lone song that I have any likeness to. Not a bad album, just not their best. Sounds dated also."
3,"OK but come on people, 5 stars?","As a casual fan of Toto's hits (99, Roseanna, Africa, Hold the Line, etc.) I have to warn other interested folks that unless you are a 'real' Toto fan this is a very middling album. '99' is a great song and almost worth the price of admission, but in today's world you're much better off just downloading it instead of splashing out on the whole thing. What we've got here is not-very-inspired prog rock a la Styx, with some attempted swagger thrown in. The band doesn't seem to be taking it very seriously either... If you're looking to dip a foot in I'd recommend Toto IV, where the poppier atmosphere fits the band much better."
3,Second opus pour Toto...,"Ce deuxième album a eu moins de succès que le précédent. Il tranche avec la musicalité du premier.Il contient pourtant de très belles chansons. A noter que "" 99 "" sera le seul Single a se démarquer en entrant dès la sortie de l'album dans les Charts...Il marquera un peu plus les esprits lorsque le groupe filme ce qu'ils considèrent comme la première vidéo musicale conceptuelle.Best : 99 , White Sister, St George and The dragon, Mama.Plus d'info sur : www.totofrance.com"
4,Melancholy in Toto,"Yes I prefer even KOD to this- why? there is a subdued, slightly negative Sunday evening feel to this album. Don't get me wrong, the playing is top-notch like any other TOTO creation.Hydra live sounds great, but here is sort of melancholy..All us boys is pure Lukather fun, and it feels like it belong to TOTO I rather than Hydra. Even the hard rocking moments like White Sister have a dark feel...don't know, I'd rather listen to Turn Back I guess."
2,For hardcore Toto fans only,"This is certainly not a bad album but I think only the Toto faithful (myself included) would care anything about it. Another reviewer comments on the ""dark and edgy"" nature of ""Hydra"" and it could definitely fall into that category. The only problem is that I don't really like my Toto ""dark and edgy"" unless you consider their 1992 release ""Kingdom of Desire"" (arguably their best) a little dark. The best tracks here are ""Hydra"", ""Lorraine"", and ""White Sister"". Enjoy whats here but don't fail to check out other superior Toto albums including the afformentioned ""Kingdom of Desire"", ""Turn Back"", and the outstanding ""Mindfields""."
3,A nice and listenable album.,"Hydra is Toto's second album. I find this disc to be pretty good and enjoyable. There's a total of eight tracks, and the musical direction is pop rock. All of the songs are listenable and solid. The album's musicianship, songwriting, and production are tight and satisfying. Some of the tracks that I like are ""99,"" ""All Us Boys,"" and ""A Secret Love."" ""All Us Boys"" is a tune that's fun, upbeat, and energetic--the singing is also cool. ""A Secret Love"" is a nice ballad, too. Hydra is worth a listen."
4,A must for TOTO fans,"I really enjoy this CD. I particually like the drumming by Jeff Porcaro. As for the songs overall: Classic TOTO (original Lineup which is my favorite)I really like the diversity of the music from rock,jazz,ballads its all on this one."
4,Simple yet good.,"Bought this for a friend who knows only a little spanish. The book is simple, love that it says the word and has a picture. Helpful if your more of a visual person. Has some basic yet important info like days of the week, months, season, and basic questions for when your out and about."
4,Spanish,It is a nice book to have on hand. Easy to use and quite helpful to have to refresh the memory!
3,A helpful little paperback,"This little paperback--See It and Say It in Spanish--has benefited me in my endeavor to gain a basic knowledge of the Spanish language. I have had the German language version of this guide for many years, so I knew that I would not be disappointed with getting See It and Say It in Spanish. Even though I completed a Spanish language audiobook course before using this book--hearing the language spoken is important--I still have utilized See It and Say It in Spanish as a reinforcement tool. This paperback is not intimidating and presents a nice way of learning the language by the word-and-picture method. Other features of this guide besides the conversation lessons are a pronunciation guide, a traveler's handy word guide, a grammar section, a Spanish-English vocabulary section, and an index. See It and Say It in Spanish is a solid reference, and I recommend it."
4,See it and say it in Spanish is excellent,"Margarita Madrigal's book ""See it and say it in Spanish"" is a great way to learn Spanish. I only gave the Madrigal book four stars because Margarita Madrigal or her publisher should offer companion DVDs and/or CDs to give the proper pronunciation of Spanish words.If you buy Rosetta Stone language-learning software, the Madrigal book is still a great complement to it. It is also a wonderful reference source for vocabulary and grammar and would be a handy phrase book to bring with you when you travel to Spain or Mexico. At a purchase price of $6.99, the book is a steal. I suggest you buy an extra copy to lend to your traveling companion(s) when you go to Spain or Mexico."
2,Word of Caution,"This book does not 'spell out' how to say these words. There is no English to Spanish vocabulary. The paper quality is poor. Lastly, this book was written in 1961...although this book was written by a teacher, education has come a long since then...you can probably find a better quality, better written book."
1,Spent Too Much,I was expecting something with more phonetic pronounciations to go with the pictures. I was disappointed with book.
3,Only for the vary intrested,"This movie was interesting , but if you are looking to be entertained and frightened you will be dissapointed.I am vary interested in the paranormal so I thought it was ok and for the price it was good."
3,Not that great....,"Why buy this collection?...you should not really waste your time nor money to buy this. You are better off buying Ghost Stories collection which is pretty much the same thing. I guess they put this together for a lower cheaper price. Good DVD...but, your better off just saving your money and buying the whole DVD collection of Ghost Stories. Ok if your just a collector...but, not great."
2,Real Ghost Stories,"I found the picture quality was not very good. Also, wasn't what I expected. I thought I was going to get ghost stories but instead I got people looking for ghosts. It's not what I wanted."
4,goosebumps,Kids running around in a school being afraid of ghost and one talking cat what a good anime
5,Great movie for the whole family.,This movie is such a great movie for anyone of any age. I strongly recmmend it. The cover is a little misleading because it makes you think it is an old movie .
1,Not a FRONT sensor,I purchased this product for Honda CRV. There are two sensors in honda crv. The description says the product will fit for the before catalyst (FRONT). But this is a after catalyst sensor (BACK). I returned it and got full refund and purchased DENSO 234-9064.
3,not much of use,"I thought of presenting this to some one who does not evenknow how to use appropriate fingers for typing.To my disappointment, it does not teach what fingers thatyou should be using. It is too simple software, not much of use."
4,7 Steps to Bonding With Your Stepchild,We are a treatment foster home and Suzen was our clinical specialist for almost a year. I have a step child that I was having problems with and Suzen suggested that we read her book and see if it would help. It helped me because I at times seemed like I was in competition with my step-son for his father's attention. It showed me new ways to deal with this and how to come to terms with it. It also helped me with the foster children in our home and really had a large impact on how I dealt with those children. I feel Suzen writes from the heart and some very good points in her book. I would recommend this book highly to any family which is dealing with difficult step-children. It is worth every penny.
2,ehhh,"I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this book didn't present any information that was new to me or wasn't common sense. I don't feel like it helped me with any of the issues I was struggling with as a step parent. However, if you're looking for a very very basic guide to step parenting this would be good."
5,Excellent,This was an excellent book for persons in a blended family situation or entering a blend family situation.
3,not as good as Ameldia Bedelia,My son age 8 enjoys the Ameldia Bedelia book series. Since this was written by the same arthor we thought we might enjoy it. This was not funny at all. It's a about an old lady who knows there is a special day but can't remmeber why it's special. She starts gettting ready for it and it turm out that is day is really her birthday. A fairly cute story but not what we expected from Peggy Parrish.
3,watery anecdotes do not make a complete guide,"My main complaint about this book is it's misleading title. Dixon's anecdotal style of writing had me skimming the fluffy text for bits of information that were actually useful to me. There was information that I needed and my surfing did improve, but the information was sparce and buried in prosaic whitewater. Now, here I am at Amazon looking for another book to answer my basic and intermediate questions about surfing. Thought I'd drop a review by."
4,The Complete Guide To Surfing,"This is an excellent book. It's the third one I have purchased for a gift because of the excellent information. This copy, purchased from Amazon.com was slightly water damaged however."
4,Smooth,"If you like jazz, especially inspirational jazz, you can't help but like this cd. It's really good music to listen to and relax."
1,"Inaccurate description, very mad.","""Audio outputs: Analog, digital coaxial, digital optical ""This is a lie. The unit does NOT have digital optical output. That's the only reason I ordered this unit. Now I've got to screw around with RMAs and mailing this thing back. Maybe Amazon should open a box and look at the product before writing the decription."
1,RosebudMom,"I'll never buy another JVC product again. A month after I bought this it began going into ""loading"" mode - which is apparently what it does when first being plugged in. After searching the poorly written manual in vain for a solution, I called them and had to pack up the thing and send it in for repair. Now, it is doing the same thing again, more and more frequently and the only solution is to unplug it and then start all over again. This makes watching tapes and DVDs pretty tedious. Forget taping anything, as you never know if it will do this during taping. Too much money, too little service and pretty much a crummy product."
3,cardio is great; toning requires too much equipment,"I like Michelle's older DVDs (not crazy about her new Peak 10 series), but this toning section requires too much equipment. It's too frustrating to try to figure out substitutes and/or move furniture around the house. I love the stretch/cool-down segment on Michelle's Your Best Body Circuit, but the stretch segment on this DVD is too long and too intense for me. The cardio segment is the only good one--it's a challenging workout that is easy to follow. The DVD is worth it for that segment alone."
2,scratchy disk,"I was looking forward to this dvd, however, it seems there is a scratch so the disc keeps stopping during the aerobic section. The workout is fun but the scratch is irritating!"
3,Some Disappointment,"The videos are good, they're Pac, so of course they are. But the videos are edited; ""bad"" words are cut out (specifically ""ho"" in ""all about you"" and in california love the bottles are blurred). it's good, but i would try to find a copy of the original versions if you really like pac. this is alright if you're desperate for his videos, but it's like turning on MTV during a 2pac marathon. i'd rather have the real deal."
4,Makaveli Tha Don definetly lives on.,"This DVD has good Tupac Videos but it was a shame to learn that Hit'em Up, Dear Mama, Toss it up and Changes were missing. For this reason the DVD's title is inaccurate because not all of Tupac's best material was present. This may be explained by the fact it was produced by a New York production company. However there are good videos with some dope intro's to the songs like in 2 of Amerikaz most wanted. Overall it is a good buy because Tupac simply always means good value 4 money. R.I.P Tupac 'Makaveli' Shakur, The GREATEST rapper to grace the planet. Rap on."
3,VHS quality,"You would think that the music videos would be in good DVD quality, but you can tell that someone simply recorded it from VHS onto DVD. the quality and sound is horrible. If your okay with bad quality and just want the videos then it should be okay to buy, but i'd rather wait for another DVD that actually shows the videos in DVD quality."
1,This is not worth the money,I don't know what me or anyone who bought this dvd was thinking but this is not a good dvd. It's not even descent it's horrible. I am a big fan of Tupac and I respect his music and what he stood for but this dvd was put together on a bootleg level. It's obviously unauthorized not like if deathrow released it it would be even better. But it has horrible sound quality that sounds like someone just hooked up their vcr to a dvd recorder and made this. Horribly put together don't waste your time or money. This doesn't even have Tupac's greatest video's it's mostly the worst one's from when he was in jail and he wasn't in half of them. You're better off going to ebay and buying a bootleg one on tape because it will probably have more video's and twice as good quality on VHS. Do not waste your money.
2,Bad Quality,I am a big Tupac fan from Amsterdam and I saw the reviews but couldn't believe that a DVD could have such poor quality so I ordered the DVD. It is worse than I ever could think of. The sound is very bad with lot of noize and the picture quality is also very bad. I think it is not original because when tupac says something like motherf*** then you will hear like for exemple when you listen to MTV another word instead. When in a videoclip you see a breast from a girl you see something shady so you can't see the breast. What is wrong with a nipple or a breast when we have beaches with thousend of people naked or topless
5,"2Pac is the epitome of rap, find out why","His rap rolls of his tounge and almost always has a message much deeper than any other rapper that has ever pressed an album. This album may as well been called the best of rap, for the best of 2Pac is, so far anyway just that. Buy it then buy all of his cd's, you will not regret it!"
5,The Civilization of Ancient Egypt,"I visited Egypt in October and received this book for Christmas. I could not put it down. It is the most informative book I have ever read about ancient Egypt. It includes excellent photographs and well designed and well placed tables. It answered all of my questions about the various dynasties, religion, culture, daily life and the fall of the kingdom. The geographic isolation of Egypt is an important factor in its development that I had not considered. As is the fact that Egypt was the first unified nation and that it was ruled by relgious principles, not militarism. This is an excellent book and should be on every educated person's bookshelf."
2,"Congratulations, you just purchased smallest book ever!","The story is great but I feel cheated when a sticky-note sized book is all that arrives. Since I have never seen a book this small, I believe that it should be made clear that it is only about 3x3 inches. Amazon should be careful about getting a reputation for allowing its customers to have that I just got taken feeling at the end of a transaction."
4,cute,"These are cute tiny books. My daughter likes them because they are easy to hold and take places. The story is cute, another crazy story from one of our favorite authors. :o)"
1,DONT BUY SUCKS,this is one of the worst quality books i have ever bought. do not buy from the manufacturer. this book is literally the size of my palm and definitely not worth the money. this is a bad product and amazon should be ashamed for accepting products from this company. i feel wronged and cheated.
1,The missing mask,"The box had the cheap face plate but no mask, right before Chrx. With these poor reviews, time for amazon to pull. They send me a slip for a full return."
1,Piece of crap!,"If I had any idea how cheaply made this mask was, I never would have paid so much for it. Don't be fooled by the word ""deluxe"" - this is not anything near collector quality. This is a cheap Halloween mask at best. Maybe worth twenty dollars..."
3,A photocopy of the original.,"Would love to find a copy of the original, but this will do until then. This is written by my great uncle and a very interesting story!"
1,The Convicts,The book its self is amazing but the typos were so great that I had to stop reading it! I suggest buying the hard copy.
5,Great Book!,"I received an Advanced Readers Copy of this book several weeks ago and loved it! Q's struggles to adjust her lifestyle to bedrest and impending motherhood had a familiar ring (I have two children). Even moms who never experienced bed rest will identify with Q's joys and worries about her marriage, family, body and baby!"
2,Not Really Worth the Time,"As someone who was on bed rest for the last trimester of my pregnancy I can relate to the character in that respect. However, the story is so-so. There are much better reads out there."
4,Calling all moms,"Quinn, known as ""Q"" is a young up and coming lawyer in New York City working her way up the corporate ladder until life throws her a curve. At a regular doctor visit six months into her pregnancy Q learns that in order to save her babys life, she must get total bed rest until delivery time.Written in journal entry form we spend three months at home with Q as she tries to reconnect with her work obsessed husband, mend relationships with her mother and sisters, help the neighbors fight a legal battle, and play confidante to a friend who is having an affair with a married man.By the end of the story, Q has her baby but life will never be the same after spending 3 months on Bed Rest.Sarah Bilston has put out a wonderful debut novel about motherhood, marriage, and bed rest and is currently working on another book titled Sleepless Nights. I sure hope it follows up with Q and Tom."
4,Fun Read,"Quinn is placed on bed rest for her last trimester. Her days on the couch are broken up by visits from friends and relatives, increasing tension with her workaholic husband, and her involvement in helping a tenants' group that is being wrongly evicted by a real estate corporation which is curiously enough, represented by her husband's law firm. Will Quinn and her husband get through a rocky spot in her marriage? Will her visiting mother drive her over the edge? Will Quinn manage to help the tenants? And most importantly, will the baby be ok? Bilston does an excellent job of portraying the dull days of a pregnancy on bed rest. The other plot lines are interesting, but somehow not compelling. Nevertheless, this is a fun read for anyone who's been on bed rest or anyone who has been pregnant."
3,Perhaps it would have been more enjoyable were I NOT on bedrest,"This was quite predictable, and simple in plot. It was an easy read, and had some humorous moments.Perhaps I am not at my most appreciative, since I am just halfway though a four month bedrest myself right now, and found some of the parts of the story ridiculous."
4,"Oh, This Brings Back Memories","Boy, did this book bring back memories. ""Q"" is a British lawyer married to a American living in NYC. But when he doctor tells her that she must spend the last 3 months of her pregnancy in bed it throws her whole sense of reality into a tailspin. Now, if she could just keep he baby health, her marriage together and enough chocolate chip cookies on hand her life would be on the road to perfect.This was a fun book and enough going on to keep you reading.Can't wait for the next in the series."
4,It's Integrous!,"When I first read JTS several years ago, I thought, ""Hey, this is an easy read and it has a good message. A simple concept, not a magic pill by any means."" And that was that. What has amazed me since then is the fact that Rafael's message has stood the test of time. Whenever I pick it up and scan through it (2-3 times a year), something new seems to always jump out at me. I think that's because his principles have integrity....they stay true. It's ""me"" that changes and because of that, this simple little book has something new to say to me each time I open its pages. I imagine I will continue to have new teachable moments as long as I continue to grow professionally. As such, JTS and its ""dormido virus"" will always be by my side. By the way, these words don't come easy for me....I'm a natural skeptic!"
3,Good parenting tips,"There are some good tips in this book, and I thinkit can help a lot of parents including me.Be aware that its extremely religious (Christian) in tone andat times you feel more preached to, verses learningparenting strategies and skills.If you are of a different religious orientation than Christian, itmight not work for you.JR"
1,Not for everyone.,"Not a single character I liked; not even the damn dog. Question: with a million homeless dogs, why do you have to fall in love with somebody else's? Soup can of advice: If you live in a little studio apartment with a mean cousin, don't get an aggressive German Shepherd.I made the stupid mistake of thinking the end would justify the miserable story, based on raves of ""Masterpiece."" Then threw the book in disgust.User's guide: This is more about unrequited Platonic love of an old queen for a young, undeserving hustler, who has a wife and four kids no less. Putridly weak narrator."
5,Ulysses,"This is a neglected but absolutely gorgeous novel. If you've read James Joyce's ""A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,"" you'll find this novel of a young woman's coming of age in an Irish convent a fascinating contrast. Highly recommended."
4,We Know What You Mean!,"When jazz greats get together great music is not always the result. It is here! It's always a treat to hear alto saxophonist Cannonball Adderley in a quartet setting. Not that I don't love the recordings he made with brother Nat, but it's nice to hear him stretch out as the solo horn. In the company of the ebullient Adderley Bill Evans' piano work is less introspective than we are used to. This is not a criticism! I love his intense piano explorations, but it's fun to hear him.....well, having fun! Half of the Modern Jazz Quartet (bassist Percy Heath and drummer Connie Kay) anchor the rhythm down solid. ""Know What I Mean?"""
3,"It had potential, but I thought it was a bit weak.","I was somewhat disappointed by this book. The main character was very well written and interesting. The perspective of the Japanese culture was wonderful, accurate and added more depth to the book- I'm very glad to see that Nyx did his research. However, the ending left much to be desired. Little was written about some characters who were most crucial to the plot. Far too much emphasis was placed on the main character to the point the others were drowned out. Consequently, near the ending it feels like you've missed something, as if author didn't include some vital information to complete the story. It all comes together in the last few pages, but it still left me feeling empty. The book was very enjoyable otherwise."
3,Not the original.,"I liked the color combo of this shoe, and I've bought Saucony Jazz's before and loved them. But beware, this is a Jazz Low Pro Fashion Sneaker, not the original (even though it's called ""Saucony Originals""). It fits a little tighter than the original (lower profile?), so if you've bought these kind of shoes before, check to see whether it's the original or the low pro."
3,"Saucony Originals Women's Jazz Low Pro Sneaker,Brown/Tan","The brand and shoe is great. Delivery time was ahead as usual. Sneaker is comfortable and well padded, just not as stylish as I was looking for."
2,Manufacturing Defect,"The Saucony Women's Jazz LoPro shoes seemed very comfortable, however the right shoe was off-kilter causing my big toe to ride on the edge of the sole.Sincerely Jeana Muir"
3,Shoes,"These shoes are kind of ugly to begin with. Never buy shoes online. I got a refund of about a third of what I paid for them and to top it all off, I never even wore them."
2,Cool Shoes,"My ""tween"" daughter loves these Saucony Jazz shoes.They are comfortable and stylish.This is her 3rd pair.I'm glad that I found them online.They are both old-school and stylish/"
4,"comfy casual shoes, but not for athletics","The sneakers are lightweight, comfortable, and have relatively good cushioning (compared with other non-athletic sneakers: Converse and the likes). They are not, however, for jogging, running or hiking as they have little structure or support and less cushion than a low-impact walking/fitness shoe. They're fine for walking to work and around the city, which is why I purchased them. Mine are new, so I can't say how well they wear. The sizing seems right on, which is nice after having to go up a size and a HALF for Nike running shoes. Weird. These are cute and comfy -- I recommend them."
4,The best sneakers,I bought these sneakers in three different colors and they are so comfortable. i am a flip flop girl but in the winter I have to wear shoes and I wore these a ton. The soles are so soft you feel like you are walking on something really soft and it makes your feet happy!!
5,Saucony Jazz Low Shoes,These shoes are so comfortable. You get support plus comfort. I have already bought another pair. They fit true to size.
4,Love these,These shoes are fantastic. Very comfortable and light weight. I do agree with other reviewers that these are not work out shoes but they look and feel great on.
4,No problems,"Shoes are comfortable, though not as comfortable as the Jazz mesh I had previously.They look nice--I like the understated color combination of black, grey and a little stripe of red. Good communication by seller. Shiiped quickly enough.No complaints at all."
3,A review from a Runner,Sorry but I do not agree wholly with the previous reviews. While these shoes are not terrible they are not the best either. They are not very thick which does not provide good support for running outdoors on hard surfaces. They did not absorb shock well either. I developed shin splints while using these shoes. Once I switched to Nike Air Pegasus my shin splints went away. I use these shoes now for jogging indoors. While these shoes are not the best for running they are good for light jogs or the treadmill. Sorry but I would not reccomend these to long distance runners or those who prefer to run outdoors on asphalt.
4,a great everyday shoe,"These are great everyday shoes for kicking around in. Great with jeans but I would not consider these to be running shoes (which is fine by me). I had a pair of the regular jazz (not low pro) and loved them for years until they finally wore out. Overall a great, very comfortable and well made shoe."
3,Jazz Low Pro,"I wish there was a size conversion presented for this product. The shoes are a little tighter than I expected but I wasn't sure how to convert them into women's sizes. The color also was a little brighter than what the picture indicated on the site. Overall, I love the Jazz Low Pro shoe but this one wasn't exactly what I thought I was purchasing."
5,Back to a desktop,"Just picked the HP m7060n up today from a local electronics store (sorry amazon) and wanted to check what others thought about it. I have to say that I'm impressed so far, computer comes loaded with tons of features, including a built in TV tuner, hook ups for your cable dvd you name it, built in memory card slots, 2 firewire ports (itunes preloaded) and 6 USB 2.0 two in the front and four in the back. It has a removeable harddrive spot that the sales guy reccomended getting and saving digital pictures to, in case your computer goes, like my laptop just did. Only thing I havent liked so far is having to burn, my own system recovery disks, which was easy on the built in DVD writer, but it took 2 hours!! All in all I think its great, if you can spend a grand and not feel guilty about it, and I don't, its a good purchase. Also the sales guy said not a great computer for gaming, but thats not my thing. take it easy"
1,Dead-on arrival HP computer,"I could never get this HP pc to boot even with the ""assistance"" of HP support. This assistance required over four hours of my time on the telephone. After the first two hours of this assistance HP sent me a recovery cd packet which took three days to arrive in the mail. It did not solve the boot problem. This required another two hours of my telephone time. HP support finally gave up and said it might be a defective hard drive. I also gave up and returned the pc as per your return policy instructions. So much for my experience with HP computers!"
5,good computer so far.,"This is an awsome computer..bought this from a Circuit City and the guy said it was possibly the best computer for gaming as well as school work and other things... and for gaming capability, the guy said that a good ATI Radeon graphics card(Don't know the model type) would be excelent for this computer for gaming.except for no Floppy Drive...overall, its an AwSoMe HP PC.and by the way, I'm a 15/16 year old..really don't want to hassle with password and logging in stuff...have enough to log in to anyways.and, whats with the Personal Media Drive Bay? I've looked through the books and doesn't say anything about it..would anyone care to explain or answer what this thing does?"
1,Very bad support,I had a similar problem of the system crashing. I ordered recovery disk from HP and it kept saying that the model is not compatible.
2,Not the Best Guide for Travelers,I've read and used both this book and Moon's Costa Rica Handbook. The latter is by far the better of the two and contains about twice the information.
4,"Good coverage of Costa Rica, but misses some important point","I used Lonely Planet on my six week trip to Costa Rica in early summer. There was very good coverage of hotels and restaurants in all price ranges, excellent maps and background information about the culture and history of the country.The author didn't say much about the Children's Rain Forest, next to the Monteverde Cloud Forest, which was a mistake I felt. I saw more Quetzals and other wildlife in the Children's rainforest than in any other park in Costa Rica. Obviously not well publicised, I was the only person in the park the entire day!Also, the author encouraged traveling to Puerto Viejo. While I was there, an American woman was gang raped and beaten by five men. Overall, it felt dangerous and I would caution other women traveling to that area."
2,Not for everyone,"This book is aimed towards college age types with a low budget. This may be the goal of Lonely Planet publishers. It lacks completely in coverage of activities in the area I planned to visit. I am going to the Manuel Antonio area which Mr. Rachowiecki says is an expensive popular area with more than 20 hotels, beautiful beaches, and a National Park. He has two pages on the area and most of that is information on the hotels. His section on the wildlife is textbook stuff without any interesting ideas on how or where to see them. I am very disappointed in the guide."
4,Great book for descriptive travel if driving,Used this book in Costa Rica 11/98. Pretty accurate description of hotels and great description of travel if going to do it yourself by car. Not as user friendly in ways hotels are listed in book inside of paragraphs you have to work harder. Best of the travel guides we used.
4,A Good Second Choice,"In preparing for a four-week trip to Costa Rica, I bought both the Moon Handbook and the Lonely Planet Guides to Costa Rica. Both were very good, but I would give the edge to Christoper Baker's Moon Handbook which provided more detailed and personalized descriptions of places to stay, eat, and visit.I have used Lonely Planet guides for years in many parts of the world and have long considered them my travel Bible. They remain excellent, reliable, and encyclopedic sources of travel information. However, I do sense they have lost some of the spark and individualism they once had and are becoming more mainstream and institutional.For travelers who plan an extensive trip to Costa Rica I would recommend buying both Moon and Lonely Planet as each provides information and insights the other misses. But if you only want to purchase one guide, I would recommend the Moon Guide."
5,THE ONLY BOOK YOU WILL NEED!,Costa Rica is a beautiful and friendly country and this book and a map were my only tools in traveling with my family. Wonderful source of information in which we used to travel from SanJose to Arenal to the Pacific Coast to the wonderful rainforest of Monterverde.....Enjoy!
2,A response to Thomas K,"One would think that an alleged ""author"" would make more sensible comments than yours, but unfortunately your retort was as well researched as Rob the Birder's book. Your incorrect assumptions about my attitude and reasons for being in Costa Rica are just that - incorrect assumptions. Plus, you give no response to the actual critiques of my review, that the book is simply poorly researched, out-of-date, and not very knowledgeable. Like Rob the Birder, I would suggest you stick to facts in the future. If I want opinions, I'll pick up the NY Times. If I want travel info, I'll go for Lonely Planet. And if I want accurate travel advice, I'll stick to LP books NOT written by Thomas K and Rob the Bent Birder."
4,A Good Second Choice,"In preparing for a four-week trip to Costa Rica, I bought both the Lonely Planet Guide and Moon Handbook to Costa Rica. Although both were very good, I would give the edge to the Moon Handbook which provided more detailed and personalized descriptions of places to stay, eat, and visit.I have used Lonely Planet books in many parts of the world and have long considered them my travel Bible. However, I have noticed that they seem to have lost some of their spark and have become more mainstream and institutionalized in recent years.For those planning an extensive trip to Costa Rica, I would suggest buying both Moon and Lonely Planet guides as each provides information and insights the other lacks. But I would give Moon the edge if you are planning to purche only one."
3,Complete compilation of music but not original artists,"Very complete compliation of music for country line dancing, but they are not sung by the original artists. When playing to a country music crowd they would know the difference. It would be nice to get a CD with the original artists on it."
4,"wonderful series, but a disappointing ending mars this book","Reviewers aren't supposed to include spoilers, so I can't explain specifically why this book's ending left me so dissatisfied. Suffice it to say that early in the book the Bad Guys make a big deal out of how crucial a role Korval plays in the whole planetary economy of Liad. But that point seems rather conspicuously to escape the attention of the Council of Clans at the book's end - with absolutely no explanation of why. As a result, the internal logic of the whole series falls apart at the culmination. Notwithstanding which, I still adore these books overall, and will continue to re-read them compulsively."
5,Great!,"Another great book from Lee & Miller.More information about all our favorite characters from the previous books, and a lot more details about Pat Rin, who turns out to be much more interesting than previously thought...Highly recommended!"
4,Thi s stays in my library forever,"Once in a while a book comes along that goes beyand its category. This is labeled as a sci-fi, but these are people, whether in the past or the future, people you care about, people you would like to know. I do not think much of the present sci-fi offerings, but this makes up for it. It is a must have!!!"
2,Distracted by cheap desktop layout!,"I was very excited to get a whole book of Tzara's after only reading him in anthologies (mostly the same poems in every one). The layout of this book prevented me from enjoying it. The font is terrible, and combined with questionable letter spacing and page placement it is kind of hard to read. I'm no design purist/snob, but something about it really jumped out at me and got under my skin. So bland considering the Dada's were so inventive with type. It's a shame because there are other books by this publisher that look rather interesting, but if they are designed in the same fashion I'll skip those. Writing by such imaginative authors shouldn't come out looking like a self-published chapbook!"
5,"brilliant,evocative,strangely eerie,lush,introspective","This offering from GC is as classy as 76:14. When the cd is running through the tracks, it leaves you with a feeling of wanting to hear it again and again.This cd could easily evoke many of life's memories,it is both ends of the mood scale. I enjoy this cd and you might too!"
5,My favorite album. Period.,"I was once walking on a beach on the Atlantic coast just before dawn, listening to this album. I was listening to the song ""Beta Phase,"" and just as the song moves from a dark, passive tone to that beautiful, active, warm tone - for those who have heard the album, you know the point I'm speaking of - the sun broke over the horizon. I hope that when I'm old and about to leave this world, I'll be able to remember that moment. Thanks for Tom Middleton and Mark Pritchard, I probably will. This album is a gift."
3,Crab 187/Slob 187 is better.......i give Dead Homiez 3.5 *'s,"I give Dead Homiez 3 1/2 stars. When i first read about it in the video store, i had to see it... so i did... and personally felt it could of used more documentary footage. I didn't really dig the funeral scenes of pooh bear, etc... i sort of thought that was fictional, but i guess its real, since i read the reviews from the rest of you below. It's a good movie, i found it to be a little boring... but i wish that the people who shot it oculd of done a better job, becuase i found it really hard to hear what the loc's from Grape Street Watts were saying... that's my only beef with this movie... the fact that stuff was hard to hear... and my volume was up and my house was empty... but stuff was hard to hear... ( i don't have a hearing prob either..."
2,Bad movie,20% was the plot on the jacket case40% was preaching from gang members telling you to stop violence and not follow their lifestyle40% was funeral/preaching/singing/mourning
2,Ahhhhhhhhh!,"I wish I could be as upbeat about this CD as the other reviewers, but I can't. I thought ""Better Than This"" was a brilliant CD, and I knew it would be hard to match, but I didn't think it would be THAT hard. Lyrically, this new CD is great. Musically, I thought it left a lot to be desired. It's bland in areas...and much too mellow as a followup to a GREAT CD. This is not the same Normals as on their first CD."
3,Not the late 70's new wave band!,"If you think these are the same guys who put out the creepy but catchy new wave paean to car-crashes, ""Warm Leatherette,"" you are wrong. Don't make the same mistake I did. Nothing against this new band, but they're not The Normals I grew up with."
3,so so movie,"I'm a big fan of WWII movie, this movie is OK, won't watch 2nd time, it is more like from the movies of late 70'"
4,Liked it more than i expected,"I can't say there was any new story to tell in this variation of ""Where Eagles Dare"" but it was quick paced and well acted. In brief, soldiers go behind enemy lines on a mission, run into trouble and have to fight their way back out. If i have a complaint, it's that the resolution of the film is rather quick. I was engaged enough to want a little more."
4,Beginning of an era!,"It kind of uncanny the start . Open up with the bit of battle . Losing friends trying to get back to base. Really rough being told to get back to the fight. Introduce to Fleming 's top squad . His best man put in charge . Lives of soldiers in war and what dealt with. What they went through to get ready for their assignment . What happens when the mission goes array. Scenic background awesome. Fighting close to vest rough pushy. Doing all they can with what the got win or lose. Lot of quick thinking, action, losing those men and no one knowing except their family. Truly gripping . Wives and family dealing with lost. Emptiness! Lost of good men that would not be rewarded for their valor and loyalty."
2,False advertising,"Low budget WW2 movie, nothing special here. The only reason I rented it was that it was ""based on the exploits of Ian Fleming"". While I'm not a big James Bond fan I thought it would be interesting for that reason alone. Sean Bean plays the leader of a British commando unit, and I got the mistaken impression he was playing Fleming. Nope. Fleming was a naval officer ""involved"" with the commandos, but he stayed in England while they went on a combat mission. WTF? The movie was okay, but I felt a little cheated."
3,Sean Bean is Looking a Little Worse for Wear,"Big fan of Sean Bean, not such a fan of this movie.The editing or direction is a bit choppy, and the character development is almost non-existant.Still, it was worth the price of the rental for any WWII movie buffs."
3,Age of Heroes,"I rented the movie because I'm in love with Sean Bean. I was expecting a more current war. Still was a good movie, just not great!"
3,Average war movie,"It is an average quality war movie. I think it is despite some accounts a fictional account as I cannot find any reference to such a raid in Norway about radar. As far as the plot is concerned it is a difficult mission of great importance to the war effort. Overall, the story is okay.The characterization was fairly ordinary. There was no one I thought was particularly interesting.If I had to say what let it down, I would say the acting. I thought it quite bad. No one impressed me with their performance. Probably, the best was James D'Arcy maybe because he played a real person who was interesting.The action scenes which are very important in such a movie were ordinary. A crack Nazi unit, I thought should have been able to make a better fight.Overall a better than average TV movie."
4,50 swingin' tracks by the King of Swing & crew,"I was hoping this would be a Lionel Hampton-free set, and it is. I love Lionel Hampton, solo and with BG, but sometimes those vibraphones take a good dance track and muck it up. I feel much the same way about Artie Shaw and His Gramercy Five's use of the harpsichord. Those instruments just don't swing. That out of the way, this is some straight, no frills swing dance music. No vocals what-so-ever, but don't let that get you down. BG's clarinet more than makes up for that. Also evident, thankfully, is the drumming excellence of Gene Krupa. All the tracks were recorded in two sessions on the same day, so they do have a very uniform feel. This is a really great addition to my Benny Goodman collection (no offence Mr. Hampton!)."
4,A good Tune Up,The format of examples followed by question/answer is neat.Got me aware of how out-of-date my French is.
5,Wow!,"How can you speak American English without using ""Wow?"" Yet when we study foreign languages in school, we never learn how to say things like that. Do you know how to say ""Yuck"" in French? It's ""Buerk!"" That's the kind of fascinating and useful thing this book tells you. What the author calls a ""tune-up"" is really the best possible introduction to speaking French -- a truly original approach which emphasizes the sounds, the gestures, the drama of French speakers. It's taken me 20 years of living with a Frenchman to realize some of the things Natalie Schorr reveals offhandedly in this book. How I wish I'd learned French from her in the first place! All languages should be taught this way. A truly wonderful book."
4,Tuning up your French,"Insightful and practical book that will provide that je ne sais quoi to your speech (and knowing it's pronounced ""jeune say kwa"" not ""je ne sais quoi"", silly!) It is, how do you say...""frenchifying""? Having studied French for 6+ years in high school and college as well as post-college, I still find myself speaking like a 2nd grader in the presence of a native French speaker. This book smartly gives you key phrases, slang expressions, pronunciation tips as well as non-verbal cues and French ""sounds"" that will get you closer to sounding like a natural speaker. Note that this book is designed for someone already familiar with French grammar and vocabulary. My only complaint is accompanying CD which is nice but could be more useful by following the book text and providing even more content."
5,A great way to Tune Up Your Spoken French,"Excellent CD! I enjoy listening to it while I'm commuting to work as a high school French teacher. I've been able to use some of the info with my classes, even though they are not experienced or even intermediate learners. They especially enjoyed learning about the actual French usage of ""Oh la la (la la(la la))"". And the insights into the French mind behind the usages are entertaining and useful. The book provides further insights into the mind behind spoken French."
3,Great read.,"I am really enjoying reading this book. It would be great to learn French in this way in the beginning i.e. useful, everyday phrases, and then move onto the grammar and language rules after you've mastered key expressions. I am thoroughly enjoying this book and it's made French fun again."
2,What a disappointment,"I don't know how this book got such high ratings. I found it to be nothing more than a list of vocabulary/ expressions, with a paragraph or two in between. It certainly is not practical for a person who is planning a trip to France, as I doubt you would be able to recall such a long list."
2,"so so, but i don`T reccomend it","i know alot of fr & i never said beurk 4 yuck ever. many books that offer slang/argot are wastes of money imo. the terms are dated! if you want to lean colloquial, spoken fr, 1) go to francophonie & listen/talk, or 2) use internet & chat w/ fr ppl, believe me they have terrible grammer and slang coming out their little ears. - how did you learn the language i'm using now? -by listening and repeating you say? - then do same with fr & you will learn w/o prob. ""La livre une fois écrit, c'est déjà mort, mais la langue, lui, est bien vivant !"""
1,Erica's notes,"I bought the toy myself, and it didn't work. So, I bought another one, and IT didn't work."
5,Fun For Kids,"I just bought this for my granddaughters birthday and she was thrilled. She quickly set it up and before we knew it, she was placing it all over the house and having the time of her life with it. Now, I'm not sure if I did a good thing or not, as perhaps there maybe times things are said that should not be recorded, but perhaps this 'toy' maybe a reminder for us not to speak so quickly *smile*....or say things that would hurt others.Anyway, she loves to play spy and this certainly has enhanced her imagination of that, to her it's all part of the game."
3,cool toy,i love this toy.it gets a 5 for ed. because you hear it. it hears up to 30 feet.If your rooms upstairs and yourr listening down its kinda fuzzy but if your on the midlle you hear great. I love this toy.
3,Do not suggest toy.,I would not suggest this toy. I have a one story house and I can't hear my mom talking on the phone very well when she is in he kitchen. I suggest a different spy toy. Many others work well.
5,i love this toy!,"i got this for christmas it's great! nobody knows i am even listening! it is really great! i'm 10 and my older sisters who are 19, 21 and 22 wants this toy they kept on fitting over it!buy it its the best toy in the world!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Am omnibus of the first couple of X-Files books, Goblins and Whirlwind.GoblinsFirst tie-in seen.When a tv show gets really popular, particularly of this sort, there are bound to be books to follow.In this case, it wasn't a particularly good one, unfortunately.Mulder and Scully and some hangers around have to investigate what appear to be attacks by an invisible man. So, bit of a strange title to start with. Just an ordinary, story, really.WhirlwindSecond of the same.The next X-Files tie-in is basically the same as the first, in terms of quality, that is, not very good.Also another strange series of killing to investigate for the FBI duo, only with some boring even for Mulder odd occurrences along the way. These were definitely disappointing.2.5 out of 5"
2,dissapointed,I'm a big fan of the x-files but I have to say that this book was a big flop! The story seemed to drag and drag and drag. I wouldn't recommend this book.
3,Great saga.........,"If you read the book you will love the movie. If you are used to all the happy endings of the Jane Austen type stories and expect it of this movie, you will be disappointed. It's very sad and you will be left feeling empty and possibly weepy. But sometimes that's just exactly what you're in the mood for, right?I thought the casting was dead on. Tess was exactly as I pictured her as was Angel Clare. Don't you love when that happens?"
4,Beautifully done,My 17 year old granddaughter and I watched this lovely movie together. The acting was superb and the scenery gorgeous. Definitely a keeper.
3,Not THAT great,"I'm sorry, but compared to other movies of its kind this movie did not rate high. The romance wasn't there and I barely felt sorry for the girl."
3,Dark and Depressing,"""Tess"" starts out with an innocent dance in a field. That's probably the last bit of innocence in the entire film. It just gets darker and darker from there. Life for the poor in England was hard then. Realism demands that it show the darkness, and this film doesn't hold back in that regard. There are ups and downs. Family relationships are complex. Courtship is realistically complicated. The scenery is both gorgeous and horrible (""horrible"" because it graphically captures the back breaking labor of farm life). Emotions, love, hardship, obligation, honor, and immaturity result in some bizarre choices, but it does make for an interesting viewing. It's hard to know how to feel at the end of the ride because it's all so complex, but it is an interesting story. If you like period films, realism, and are okay without a happy ending, give it a try."
3,Not for those with hearing difficulties,Looked colorful and interesting. Unfortunately no cc or sub-titles for the hearing challenged so I could get the gist of the story.
3,Tess of the d'Urbervilles,Needed to purchse dvd for my daughter. needed to read the book for school and also wanted to see the movie. She is 17 and said it was pleasant to watch more enjoyable than the book..
3,Heavy Subject Matter,"Wow... I didn't know what this movie was about. I purchased it because I love Justine Waddell in Wives and Daughters. Well, Justine does an amazing job, of course, but the subject matter is a little heavy. Call me clueless, but I was very suprised. If you aren't familiar with the storyline, you should familiarize yourself with it before you decide to purchase this film."
2,Brave Young Lady,"The movie was ok, but predictable. After I bought the video, I realized that I had seen it before. It is one of those movies that you only want to see once. Unfortunately, I have to keep it. Right?"
2,Hardy kills another romance novel,"Well adapted, true to the story, but honestly: Of all the books out there, why would they film this? It's depressing, dismal, and desperate. There are NO heroes in this. I would compare it to Vanity Fair but at least in Vanity Fair there is a good guy to get a silly girl in the end.This is what happens when men write romance novels. If you don't believe me watch his other ""classic"": The Major of Casterbridge.1 star for Music1 star for Acting and adaptation0 for brilliant storyIf you want to watch a good romance that has depth, makes you weepy, and that ends well, watch the BBC adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's North and South."
1,Disliked,I found this movie to be a bit boring. It seemed to drag on. Would not have bought if I knew that it was going to be this bad.
5,I am a Justine Waddell fan,"My name is Sarah and I am 12 years old. I thought that Tess of the D'Urbervilles was a very good film, in fact I thought it was brilliant. I have seen other films with Justine Waddell in, they were The Woman in White and Wives and Daughters. I strongly recommend Wives and Daughters as absolutely fantastic especially if you are as big a fan as me!"
5,Wonderful story but not a happy ending,"The movie is magnificant, the actors are slendid and the beautiful English countryside is filmed all too well. The story is a sad one that gives hints of a probable happy ending. Justine Waddell is a beautiful actress and Oliver Millburn is so innocently handsome. The emotions in this movie are deep and heartfelt. You feel the pain and struggle that Tess goes through with this magnificant cast. I would recommed this to people who aren't into the ""happily ever after"" endings and are more inclined to accept a realistic ending. Yes it's heartbreaking and the things Tess does can and are misunderstood but this story takes place in the Victorian era therefore her actions are proper for that time. Absolutely wonderful cast and story."
4,good depiction,"It is good, but my only complaint is that the video is of quite low quality for a DVD. There is an annoying blank strip of line that flashes intermittently throughout the movie, as if it were an old VHS tape. Otherwise, the story is a pretty faithful adaptation of the novel."
2,A fabulous adaptation of a terrible book,"The BBC versions of literary classics are always true to the book (including characters, setting and emotions) and this movie is no different. The scenery is breathtaking, the acting fabulous.So if I liked this movie so much, why give it only 2 stars? Because while I loved how the movie looked and felt, I really disliked the actual story. A commentary on society from the obviously troubled author Hardy, this story is very dark and depressing. Poor Tess never had a chance against her circumstances - the ending is no surprise.So I have to say - if you liked the book or enjoy Hardy anyway, watch this - if you only want to watch another great BBC film - watch Pride and Prejudice!"
5,Absolutely Stunning Tearjerker,"Like the equally magnificent Mayor of Casterbridge, A&E; has done another wonderful job with this immensely entertaining adaption of Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles.Everything from the casting to the sets to the acting is superb, and Justine Waddell truly shines as Tess. Not only is she breathtakingly beautiful in the role, but she conveys Tess's spirit and pluck as few other actresses could. Jason Flemyng as Alec D'Urberville is also a standout, and plays the role with a devilish charm that is irresistible. The rest of the cast is likewise great.The movie, at a running time of about three hours, moves along at a fast pace; anyone will most likely watch all of it in one sitting.Although the ending is depressing (as most of Hardy's novels are), the film is truly a treat that you won't want to miss out on.Bravo!"
5,Doing something weird... with a banana,"This is an excelent representation of SJR live. The agression, the in-your-faceness(is that a word?) and the all out old-school thrashing. CBGB Jesus H. Christ!"
1,Phil = Waste,"The only thing good coming out of this dvd is maybe some action in the pit. Phil has become a waste of life, he cant even stand up on stage, or remember what song he is singing next. Its a shame to see after all he has done for metal."
1,Get Leadsinger microphone instead,"The CD's for these systems only contain 4 songs each. In order to compile any kind of library of songs, you have to buy many CD's, which are not cheap. And switching from song to song takes awhile. It is like a DVD player, in that it takes awhile for the system to recognize the CD.A much better alternative is the Leadsinger Karaoke microphone. It is a self contained microphone that comes with 300 songs. And, you can buy extra chips that have around 1000 songs each."
5,Great for early morning workouts,"I purchased this Schwinn IC Elite Indoor Cycling Exercise Bike after a lot of research and was still apprehensive. I have added look style toe clips for a more realistic experience. Can't beat it for winters, bad weather, and early mornings before work. After 3 yrs I've gotten a lot of use out of it. It provides a great workout. For some odd reason I still feel like it would like some panel reading on distance traveled, but for now I just watch soccer and bike for an hour."
1,Bike is Great - Amazon Sucks!,"I ordered this bike and after three days of staring at order status of ""This order is being readied for shipping and cannot be canceled"" I emailed and asked why it was taking so long. Amazon canceled my order and I was forced to get in back of the line again. Amazon has truly gone downhill. I have been a customer for over 5 years and every time I place an order the service gets worse and worse. My advice is that you buy this bike somewhere else"
3,Yee Haw! Time for some good old country linedancin'!,"This album was played to me while I was sitting in the ""Truckin' Truckdriver's Truckstop"" down near Sequim, WA. I had been feeling rather blue myself, after walking by the big picture of Jesus dying for our sins on the wall in Downtown Port Angeles. I got to thinking about the Lord and so I sat myself down across the street from Safeway, at the little church, and began to eat my takeout jojo's. After this hearty meal I headed out in my truck to the Truckin' Truckdriver's Truckstop and watched all the tired truckers line-dancing with the waitresses, and realized what the meaning of life was. God made our life so we could enjoy country. You won't disagree with me after you've heard this album."
2,Mythology Repeats Itself,"Westward Ho transplants the famous Greek Epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey, into Elizabethan England. Complete with Achilles (Amyas Leigh), Patroclus (Frank Leigh), Helen (Rose), Paris (Guzman), and a Trojan War (The Defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588). The Odyssey too comes in, with the great wanderings in distant lands. Rather unexpectedly for a novelist of Kingsley's calibre and values, the book has transformed the Elizabethan English into a noble race of Godlike Heroes and the Spanish into villains far worse than the Trojans have ever been depicted as being. Jesuits are particularly maligned, and Indians are unfairly portrayed. This tends to dampen the reader's enthusiasm somewhat, as he/she realises that the author himself may be more remote in value system from our day and age than the characters he portrays. The one redeeming feature is the high tension it generates, but this is - probably consciously - influenced by the epics, as the author himself hints."
3,"Good, but falls short in it's purpose","I am a fan of Mr. Chamber's drumming. However, I didn't feel that this was an instructional video at all. There was a guy asking questions to Dennis and he'd answer them on the drums. But, some of these questions are not really what I would like to know. Mr. Chambers can really play, there is no doubt. But in this video, he doesn't really give you exercises on how to play. I much enjoy Dave Weckl's videos more for instruction and content. This video seemed to ""rehearsed"". I gave it 3 stars 'cause it had some great performances with John Scofield, Mike Beard, and Gary Grainger. So, if you are looking for instruction, don't bother. If you are just looking to see him play, well, then buy the tape."
5,Wow!,"If you are interested in missionary work at all, especially in South America, this is a ""must-read"". I sat in awe of the simple faith that inspired such an amazing story. This book is the American missionary side of the FANTASTIC book, ""Spirit of the Rainforest: A Yanomamo Shaman's Story"" by Mark Andrew Ritchie. Today, most of us wait until the exact right time with the exact right funding and support and all the common sense we can muster before we move. The Dawsons show us that when God calls, moving in faith is more important that moving in logic. Highly recommended!"
5,learning french,"i bought this and am using it with a private french tutor, it seems to be a good way/method to learn french!"
2,Not Easy!,"I've tried the book alone, book with tapes, tapes alone, NOT as easy as expected! Very confusing.....I was hoping to learn a bit of French, but you just listen to conversations, while trying to follow with the book at the same time!"
2,Not for the sole audio beginner.,"If you have the book in front of you and are able to follow along, the product might work. However, I bought it to try and learn the language on my daily commute to work and found out quickly that they do not provide an English point of reference. Without knowing what they are saying, well you are just listening to gibberish."
5,perfect fix,"Ordered for my Homelite 240 with the 18"" bar and the 91 sprocket. A good price for a hard to find item. Shipped and delivered on time."
4,It does what it should ...,"I think it's ridiculous that any 18"" chain can't fit any 18"" chain saw! I couldn't find this chain locally so I got it through here. It fit perfectly and cuts fine ... what more can I say?"
5,Woooooooooo!,"I love this green salsa. Our local grocery store carries it, and the taste is wonderful. Warning though: Mrs. Renfro will burn your tongue off. This is not a salsa for the meek. Mrs. Renfro's Gourmet Green Salsa is literally one of the hottest food products I have ever eaten. After about 10 chips the burn kicks in. After 20 chips, you are doing the follow routine: dip chip, eat chip, swallow, drink water, pant, pant, wipe brow, take a few deep breathes, wipe brow, pant, yell ""woooooooo!"", and repeat.Wonderful taste, and a perfect gift for the hot food lover on your gift list."
5,"A ""must have"" for all poets' bookshelves","This is the best book of poetry forms that I have found available. Ron Padget explains in simple terms how each form is constructed and gives an excellent example for each one. It includes japanese, and ancient forms also."
4,"Nemo - no, not the fish.","You're probably wondering like I was whether Nemo Pt.1 (this is just the normal version as opposed to this limited edition)is better than this one. The answer is Pt.1. While this edition has a video, it's not a DVD video and you can just download the Nemo video for free from www.metalstorm.ee. The normal edition has more songs and 'White Night Fantasy' which is not on the 'Once' album. While Nemo is a terrific song, if you want the video, buy the DVD single or the normal Nemo single. There is also a video on the normal version which I find a bit more enjoyable than the Nemo video clip. The video is a collection of shots taken behind the scenes of Nemo and is played to 'White Night Fantasy'."
1,Horrible,Seeing as they are fins and french to english translation for 'fin' is 'end' it just about somes up this crappy band from Europe.
4,"Rich, but a little dense...","This book is an amazing resource for those studying the social, psychological and historical aspects of epic as a literary art form. Most of the contributing writers are insightful and their theories are interesting and profound. However, it's also a challenging book to wade through -- happily I was only reading a few articles for my grad class because reading it cover-to-cover would have turned my brain into overstimulated oatmeal."
2,Not ready for prime-time!,"Using this ""free"" solution for a professional web store won't save you any money. These scripts are incomplete and written in Perl4 so they don't take advantage of all that Perl5 has to offer. I have spent countless hours and hundreds of dollars hiring programmers to correct and finish this set of scripts for a client's web site.The book is interesting to read and you will learn some foundations of Perl programming (if you can get past the spelling, grammatical, and CODE typos). But the old adage applies here: You get what you pay for. There are better solutions for complete online commerce solutions. They just cost a bit more."
2,This is not a book for first time Commerce setups....,"This book is based solely on the program that comes on CD-Rom with the book. So before you will understand what the book is talking about you have to install the files on your server. The book makes most of the installation part a huge guessing game. When you finally get it installed, check if it works. If your lucky you won't have to call your Hosting Service to have any little extra services turned on just to get the program running. Now that you have it WORKING right and you move on to the rest of the book, your stuck with a very unattractive web site. Help on customizing this cgi is another guessing game. All in all I say this book was very vage and really doesnt get down to the nitty gritty on web commerce. It's almost as if they are trying to get you to use thier program for some reason, which by the way is out dated and you'll have to download a newer version online."
2,Don't expect this book/software to work miracles.,The book claimed that you could download the latest software from the website and that there is a windows version as well as the unix version available for download. After not being able to find the windows version for download I sent email to the author inquiring where I could find the windows version. I was then emailed back with a long email claiming that they were very busy and that if I wanted support I would have to pay $300.00! I then emailed them back saying that I only bought the stupid book and only wanted to know where the windows download was. I then got email stating how to get the unix version working on the windows platform.
3,"Miracles - no, Solutions Yes","If you do not already understand the basics of PERL programming, web server operations, and CGI, this book might help you and it may just confuse you. If you do already understand these things pretty well, then the book is both enlightening and entertaining. I downloaded the unix software first, and had it running under apache on Windows 98 in about 5 minutes. I was so impressed with the quality and flexibility of the code, I decided to buy the book just to show my support, and pick up the helpful hints and insightful commentary that Gunther, et al have on the web, ecommerce, and programming in general. Well, well done!"
3,About the only way to set up PGP for Sol's WebShop,"Selena & Gunther's book offers all the information they 'forgot' to put in the documentation for their scripts. Guess they're just following in Microsoft's footsteps?In any case, it's a fairly well written book, and certainly solved at least a few of the problems I had with their shopping cart. I just hope they get around to updating the pgp portion of the script, to accept newer versions."
2,Need more setup information for Windows 95,"I think that this book could be great if they can include how can you make the setup for the different plataforms (W95,Unix). Also the free versions of Perl can be on the CD. You don't have support for any question that you have, and I think you won't have it. I want to share information in how to setup this program with Windows 95 users."
2,Marketing students would find this useful,"Marketing students would find this book useful, particularly if they are looking for case studies of European brands. The brands mentioned are: Adidas, Ariel, Décathlon, Coca-Cola, Orangina, Vache-Qui-Rit, Danone, L'Oréal, Nestlé, Nike, Nivea, Pepsi, Perrier, Peugeot, Proctor & Gamble, Unilever, Virgin, Vivendi, Volkswagen, Yoplait.Overall, I found the book somewhat useful. Now when I go shopping with my wife, I look at the brands and I better appreciate what goes into marketing those brands and products.Admittedly, my aim in reading the book was to learn more about how to reinvent a brand, but the book does not really tell me how to do it in detailed steps. Of course, that wasn't it's primary focus in the first place."
3,Germaine's crazy family revealed,"After reading this book one feels sorry for poor Germaine.For a start, her mother was mentally unbalanced. Germaine reveals that when she bought home a boy friend, her mother would often open the front door wearing a pair of underpants on her head and nothing else but a suntan. Her mother ""used words as ammunition, not for communication."" This book is Germaine's search for the true identity of her father. To hide his illegitimate birth, her father wove a web of falsehoods around his early life. He was always distant with Germaine, and never gave her a proper hug.Feeling suicidal she once fell over a cliff, and it is ironic she was only saved by her father's coat she was wearing when it caught on a snag. There are dreary false trails and much padding in this book.Germaine's self-pity gets a bit much to take.Her vinegary nature must be in part a result of her family situation.At the end of the book I read,someone had pencilled in ""so what."" An apt comment."
2,Cute but disappointing,"We purchased this border for our second son's nursery. The border is extremely cute, HOWEVER it is NOT self sticking as stated. Huge disappointment. Be prepared to use an alternate glue / paste to adhere to the wall. Also because each roll is only 15 feet long, we had to order 3 rolls. No big deal except the rolls were uneven in width! Huge problem when it's time to start a new roll of border in the middle of a wall. The 2nd and 3rd roll were about a 1/4 of an inch shorter than the first roll we put up. As I stated originally, the design is very cute and colorful but the problems with it failing to stay on the wall (which is somewhat of a necessity) and the uneven width made this purchase very disappointing."
5,a splendid album,"hello,just want to say that I took the cover picture for this 'Italian version' of ""The Live Takes"", a picture taken on the Opening Day of Jazz Middelheim Antwerp Belgium in the summer of 2001. it is a festival where Toots is the Godfather. while taking this pic Toots enjoyed the sounds coming from the Festival tent where Bill Carrothers was having his soundcheck.later that day Toots had a dubbelconcert, one with Bill Carrothers trio, the second one with Brussels Jazz Orchestra conducted by Maria Schneider.this CD renders a beautiful inside in the large oeuvre by Toots and his live recordings with many of his colleagues.don't miss out on this beautiful CD. as for this particular cover, it is now out of print. thank you dear Dirk Godts, manager of Toots, for using my portrait of Toots for the cover. I feel extremely honoured.Toots is magnificent, Belgium and the rest of the world loves him a lot.best wishes,Gert van Gelderphotographer"
2,String Arrangements? If you like them...,"Despite the excelent playing by Zoots, this CD will only please you if you like string arrangements, or worse yet, keyboard sound alike string arrangements. Personally not for me..."
4,Good Information,"I doubt that it will ever be easy to find a good literary agent, but Peter Miller will give your query letter a good read. Though he didn't go for mine, he did at least take the time out to explain the whys and wherefores of his needs. I guess in this world literature is a business, a difficult truth for a would be literary artist to swallow, but a truth that can't be ignored by a writer who wants to find a major publisher. At least he was honest, and there's something to be said for that."
1,Peter Mille is not what he wants us to believe he is,I just read THE PHONEY PRINCESS in it it says super agent Peter Miller and Jean Sasson invented best seller PRINCESS together. Princess is extraordinary amazing fib. it is not true account of a princess that is what is written in the Phoney Princess book.
1,"I Know You, YOU ARE BELLE!","I have this doll at home, it is great to have the Hair got messy so I turned it into A ponytail oh can you hear me? Belle is a great doll! Note: This Doll Is Not Glass"
5,Grapefruit knife,Looks to be good quality. Sharp and cuts grapefruit. Not much more to say. I wish I had bought it years ago.
2,Squirt Free Grapefruit Knife,"The design of this knife is very odd. When holding the one end, the other cuts into the palm of your hand. HIC Harold Imports should have included a blade shield to protect the user from injury."
5,Preparing grapefruit is a breeze,"This clever little knife has made preparing grapefruit a breeze. The double-bladed straight edge of the knife makes for easy sectioning, while the rounded, serrated blade easily slices the sections from the rind. It took me a few uses to get the hang of using the knife, but once I learned how to use it efficiently I was able to prepare grapefruit faster than with a regular knife. Sometimes little bits of grapefruit get stuck between the double-bladed knife, but it's easy to wiggle the blades open and flush it clean with water. The knife is not super high quality, but for the price is a very good purchase."
3,Does a decent job.,This does the job but it's more work then I expected. The two knife side get pulp stuck in them so they dont always stay close to the membranes and then the fruit gets kind of left behind. If youre careful and pay attention though the problem can be avoided. Not the worst one I've owned.
2,Dangerous to use,The knife is very sharp which is good and bad considering there are blades on both ends of the handle. This design just doesn't work for us; it's too easy to cut yourself.
4,grapefruit knife,It was a gift given to a friend who did not have a grapefruit knife. Friend seemed surprised.
1,I never use it,Nice product but I never take the time to find it and use it...Just using a paring knife instead
5,Great grapefruit knife...,This grapefruit/citrus knife is great. The dual blades make cutting a grapefruit quick and easy. I was so impressed with it that I bought 4 more to give as gifts for family and friend who like grapefruits. I have one at home and one at the office. The best grapefruit knife I've ever used or owned. I highly recommend it to everyone. It was also shipped to me very promptly. Great product...
3,Too Complicated,"The main overwhelming pro is that the quality of this knife is great for the price. The cons revolve around the design. The wooden handle between either end is small and narrow. Fortunately I have tiny hands, but I couldn't imagine anyone else having a comfortable grasp without part of their palm gripping whatever end blade they aren't using. The double blade side seems like a good idea to cut between segments (liths), but unless you take the time to properly guide it, it cuts into the meat of the grapefruit instead, leaving meat to still cling to the liths. I would have been happy with just the curved blade, which I can easily maneuver around each pulp piece. Grapefruit pieces are too small to have to fuss with flipping the knife to get the right blade. Overall, this is one of the cheapest knives I've seen, and I'd rather get this one than dish out $15 for one that's slightly better."
4,squirt-free grapefruit knife,The product arrived quickly and I started to use is right away. My only complaint is that it is a liitle difficult to clean.
4,Best little kitchen tool I bought,"small easy to handle, does what it is made to do,,, no squart on the knife cut and great cut on the curved side. Might have a bit of a problem on large grapefruits because the knife ends are on the short side.."
4,Taking religion to the extremes,"There is no need to ""psychoanalize"" Sidney Rigdon. His own words are proof enough that he was far beyond any religious zealots you and I have encountered. If by ""psychoanalysis"" the TBM reviewer below meant that Van Wagoner quotes from Rigdon himself showing that Rigdon was a religious nutcase then yes there is some truth to that. Van Wagoner did an excellent job of letting Rigdon hang himself."
1,Outdated and prejudiced,"The only useful part of this book was the beginning chapters which talked about Rigdon's early work with Campbell and Scott. Otherwise, it is just an anti-Joseph view of Mormon history. I found much more useful information in Bushman's Rough Stone Rolling."
3,torn between 2 & 3 stars,When I saw the price of this book my expectations were high. This is a good book but there must be better cabinetmaking books out there. I was looking for various modern tech for different systems. This is not it. I have an older book that goes into a lot more detail about box vs case systems. I just wanted a modern updated book. Dont get me wrong this book has a lot of information in it. I was disapointed in that they could have skipped a lot of this and got more into different systems. Would I buy this book now knowing what is in it? Probably it does have some interesting reading.
4,A great reference book,"I chose the four star rating because this book is thorough and together in an easy to use format. Yes, it is a text book, but easy to use if a person wants a reference book."
2,Low Budget British Psychedelia,"I believe this record was released in very limited numbers around 1969 or 1970. The songs are average but its the record's fidelity that makes this record completely insignificant. The sound is so muffled that it brings to mind the recordings of the great country bluesmen from the late 1920's. Many record collectors and fanatical fans will lead you to believe this record is excellent or a lost classic. This is not the truth. Avoid this expensive, overhyped record at all costs."
4,Worth the money,"If you are a professional regarding short selling, I suppose this book will not cut it. For the person getiing their feet wet, this book is very informative, and gives a good basic for shorting. Easy to understand and well written. Points you in the right direction. It does not fool you into thinking there is no homework to be done before you short."
2,Errors...,"Proofreading is critical, especially in a text where people will be risking money in the market. There are some very basic errors even before the book gets to the more difficult stuff:Page 36:""2500 shares of ABC at $10 = $500050 shares of XYZ at $10 = 2500""(Obviously these are both wrong.)Page 47:""You short 100 shares of Great Drop at $100 per share. The stock hits $110...the next day you get a confirmation from your brokerage firm. It says you covered the stock at $11 and sustained a $100 loss.""By my calculations, if you bought 100 at $100 ($10,000 total) and covered the same 100 at $11 you would have an $8,900 GAIN ($10,000 - $1,100 = $8,900).There are, however, many good ideas for targeting a potential short: insider trading, proxy information details, overvaluations, etc, as well as the risks involved: buy-in, short squeeze, no-borrow, IRS regulations, etc. If the text is reprinted and the errors fixed, it would be a good read..."
1,Don't waste your money on this book,"I was enticed by the first 2 chapters ... In summary, if you understand the basic of finance, just don't waste your money on this .... If you don't know finance, this book is a misguidance. Read the first 2 chapters and that's it."
5,Great Disc... But...,"My PEACE & LOVE, INC. cd suddenly stopped playing in my computer's cd drive. So I bought a new one from Amazon. Guess what? That one also refused to be recognized by my computer's cd drive. But my computer's cd drive will play any other music cd. What gives? I even tried reading the two bad discs with my external cd/dvd drive and that also failed. Is it possible that the PEACE & LOVE, INC. discs degrade quickly due to some manufacturing defect? This is lame because I want to transfer this album to my iPod, but can't seem to get a clean disc.Jerry in Boise, Idaho"
3,Information Society's 3rd CD,"""Peace and Love, Inc."", Information Society's third CD, opens with the same-named single, an upbeat, pop/dance tune. The majority of songs on here are like this: airy and synth-heavy, except for filler tracks like #3: ""To the City"" (which I liked) and #12: ""300bps N, 8, 1 (Terminal Mode or ASCII Download)"" (which just gave me a headache; it's three minutes of high-pitched computer screaming). I wasn't too terribly impressed with this CD, but Information Society and/or '90s techno fans should like it. Lyrics are included."
1,Not among my favourites,"Information Society does not know how to make music. They are capable of pushing the power button on their synths and they have listened to a couple of bands that are a lot, a whole lot, in fact worlds apart from this untalented bunch of sound abusers.Please do not throw your money away on this collection of garbage. You will regret it. I tried them because this cd only cost me about 2 dollars. The shop apparently liked to get rid of this joke.I too had heard some people speak of groups like Depeche Mode and New Order when mentioning Information Society. But make no mistaken and beware: the only thing they have in common is that their bandname also consists of two words.I want to be paid a fair amount of money before I would sit down and listen to Peace and Love inc., because it is the next sad thing to do after dying. It is really that bad."
3,lite reading,I bought this for the good price and for some research into a story I was writing where one character had celtic ties. It didn't really give me much information to use. Next time I'll stick to library books I can just return.
3,Interesting For What It Is,"Low budget animation over film footage. The story begins interestingly enough with a family fleeing into the forest to escape an invasion. Later they live in the forest and finally all but Sarah are captured. The middle of the movie becomes incredibly long though with music and repetitive animation sequences seeming to go on forever, as Sarah plans to destroy a bridge and then survive the winter.The film is admirable for what it undertakes and does have many surprisingly moving (if not beleivable) moments, but could have done with a serious editing job. Sometimes the animation just seems like backdrop to the interesting musical score: Vivaldi's Four Seasons, and some solo clarinet work by Giora Feidman. Sara and the Squirrel is at least a unique piece of work running at a somewhat long 64 minutes."
4,Minetonka,"Love these moccasins! They are so comfortable, but I have very narrow feet and had to pull the drawstring a bit tighter to keep them on my feet."
5,Great moccasin,"I have bought and worn Minnetonka Moccasins for many years. The smooth leather moccasins are comfortable and never go out of style. I can wear these moccasins with any of my sport clothes. These moccasins are a ""Classic"". I order my regular shoe size but I have ordered them 1/2 size larger if my size was not available and had no problem with the larger size."
4,Fabulous moccasins,Arrived on time and as expected. They are super comfortable. The only minor complaint I have right now is that they leave a black residue on my feet but I'm sure that will go away in time.
3,Take Note - This Is An Indoor Slipper - Not Outdoor Shoe,"Received quickly and was well packaged....I do love Minnetonka brand. Now let me say it is a lovely shoe as far as looks. The length seemed fine but runs a little small as far as the width for me. Call me frugal/cheap but I don't like the idea of paying over $15 for a house slipper - well not for myself anyway. The bottom/sole is made of suede - in fact it is one continuous piece with the top and back securely sewn, (to myself I say it is a moccasin - duh). Why I thought I could wear them outdoors is beyond me - guess I should have paid more attention to the words ""Soft Sole."" I returned them."
4,"Adorable, but they run really small","I got a pair in white and tan, and theyre both too small for me!! theyre adorable and look soo comfy, but they dont fit! I usually wear an 8.5 in womens so i got both of these in a 6.5 in mens..and i cant even get my foot into them! Im going to exchange them for a 7.5...hopefully thatll work!"
5,Minnetonka Moccasin,"they run a little smaller, I should have ordered size 7 instead of 6.5. Maybe next time they should post that they run small, no regular size. Besides that, they are great."
4,New Info on This Product,"I love these moccasins for house slippers, but I always forget about the sizing. These mocs run narrow and long for the size. I could have used a shorter, wider moc rather than the ones I got. Will use these for the winter, to wear with socks, so they won't go to waste. Also, it helps to add a pair of those cut to order sole supports inside the moc, since these are just not made for foot support, but rather for comfort.New info: I got moccasins that appear to be made for two right feet! They are both the same, but supposedly shaped by the insoles to fit correctly. Wrong. I sent them back for a refund."
5,one of the best in the history of music,"A Hard Day's Night marked The Beatles continuous success over the years with unexpected outcomes of achievements and fame. Obviously, the album was incorporated into a film as a soundtrack album. This also showed The Beatles' influence and impact on music and film industry even today."
5,Best movie of the series,Children of the corn 2 is excellent. Way better than the other 6 films. From start to finish this movie takes you on a ride. The bingo scene was great. And when the children chained the door in the church meeting. That was a unforgettable scene. Christie Clark was very hot in that movie as well. This was very close to being the best horror film of the 1990's.
3,"Makings of a good movie, with little suspense","Children of the Corn II came out 8 years after the original, and beckons the question: Why was this sequel even made? Barely having any significane to the original film, this sloppy sequel stars a bunch of people that no one cares about. This makes for a very lousy and UN-suspenseful film, because when you don't like a character, you hope they die and aren't too worried or scared when they do. However, the film is not completely lost. It has a much faster pace than the original and plenty of blood and guts to satisfy any horror fan. But if you really want something scary/entertaining, Children of the Corn II is not for you."
4,Chuldren of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice,"I have seen all of the movies in this series. My mom had suggested renting one one day so I said sure and we did. This one was the last one I saw (I saw them in a mixed up order) but one of the best. I wasn't planning on seeing it, thinking it was just like the rest, but I am a huge fan of Christie Clark (who played Lacey--the girl who was running through the cornfield), but I found that this one had also developed the story even more with Micah and the rest. It was interesting and the killings were great!"
2,I was in this movie,"I'm only writing a review because I was actually in this movie. It was a bit part with only two lines -- and they were both cut from the final film -- but as least you can see me in some scenes. I played Deputy Palmer, who is seen talking to and holding back various extras during the 2nd scene in the movie, where the police and others have gathered outside a building after the discovery of bodies in the basement. This was supposed to be the beginning of my film 'career,' but when a different talent agency did the casting for Hellraiser 3 I couldn't find any more work. Plus, I became a single parent and had to spend all my time caring for my daughter. Oh well. Overall, the movie was lousy, but I had fun during my two days on the set."
5,Finished up,I watched all of the COTC movies except this one. I looked all over for this movie but could not find it on DVD only to find out it's not on DVD or on Netflix.
5,Great movie from the 90s,"I have been waiting for this to come out on dvd for ages and I just love this movie. It is cheesy and some of the acting is awful, but it is just one of my favorites. The transfer to dvd held up well."
1,Sucks,"This movie sucks so bad. The deaths were terrible (as in boring). The moving mound in CCOTC1 returns but you still dont see what the monster looks like!!!!! Most of the kids die at the end due to weopon backfiring, the music is five star, i would recomend the soundtrack. Save your money, dont by this movie."
3,"As Sequels go, this is good!","I have seen every single COTC movie, and must say: The series should have ended with this one. Though, I don't feel the movie warranted sequels, this one is good. It fools the same pattern as the first, in most ways, and keep with Kings idea. Then 3-6 just kill the whole series. I really hope there is not a 7th. Ryan Bollman (micah) did a avery good job with his role. I was impressed. I have not seen him in anything else, but would like to know if he has been in anything else? He is a very good actor!"
1,Another bad movie put onto Stephen King,"A sorry sequel to a sorry movie, and another false usage of Stephen King's name, and as a reply to another person who reviewed this movie, the original was NOT! a classic! All 5 of these movies are rip-off's of Stephen Kings good name."
1,THEY'RE BACK!,The children are back with a new leader after the massacre in Gatlin. More bodies turn up and a reporter and his son must stop the madness. I didn't really think that this film should have been made and it is an insult to the original classic.
1,If you're buying this for Widescreen save your money,"Because it's full frame. Lazy release from Echo Bridge. It gets 2 because at least it's on DVD, albeit in a flawed state.Lowering the rating to 1 star because of the duplicitousness of Echo Bridge having people come and rate low reviews as unhelpful."
4,"ATTABOY, DINO!!","Dean Martin was without a doubt one of the greatest entertainers who ever lived and it's great to see him back in action in this DVD. It's a pity there's no performer around today worthy of even shining his shoes. The video quality for the most part is quite good and the audio is fair, but much better if played thru a home theater system. I would have given this set five stars, if not for two drawbacks.At 64 minutes and 46 seconds, it's much too short. Also, the menu is flawed. I only hope that Greg Garrison or whomever is in charge of Dean's legacy, will release more sets of this type. Dino Crocetti, you are sadly missed!!"
3,Fair,"It was pretty much what I expected, however, I think there was a defect with the DVD itself. It skipped some of the songs and I had to replay it to see it in its entirety. (Not a good quality DVD)"
4,The King of Cool,"Dean Martin is, was and shall ever be the epitome of cool. The man's warmth and good humor just shines through in this collection. This was a man who was truly having a kick doing what he did and he shared that fun with his audience. Even when the material is questionable, such as the uptempo arrangement on ""Old Man River,"" Dino lets us in on the joke.The video and audio could be better, but, hey, this is videotape that's over thirty years old. My only real gripe is that the songs are not individually chaptered.If you are too young to remember Dean's show and know him only from his films, give this DVD a try. You're in for a treat!"
4,Finally Dean Singing,"This is many of his cuts from his TV Show. Recently aired on PBS. It would be nice if the sound quality was better but in the late 60's on TV the quality was just plain bad. I amazed how good they really made this sound. If you're looking for Dean singing song after song this DVD is really your only option. The other with a few cuts is the Legendary Concert with Sinatra, Judy Garland and Dean. Pick that one up as well. They colorized a B&W show and it's somthing.Enjoy the DVD."
2,A very mediocre bossa nova album,"I agree with Katie's review. I purchased this CD after hearing Bebel's excellent contributions to the ""Next Stop Wonderland"" soundtrack and ""Brazil 2 Mil"", and was very disappointed. I can't wait until her new album comes out though! While this CD is not terrible, I haven't had the urge to listen to it more than once or twice."
4,Almost complete,"I started listening to Churchill as a school boy from my father's recording of the 10"" vinyl disk inserted in the Life Magazine two volume WWII of forty years past. Oddly, this series has many times the volume of that little record, but fails to contain all that record had. So it looses one star.Otherwise, the sound ranges from acceptable to good. And at a good price to boot."
2,Did not live up to my expectations,"I ordered the dvd because I really liked Maggie Smith in Harry Potter, but really did not enjoy any of themovies on this dvd. I was disappointed, will probably throw it away. She is a great actress, but I did not like the parts played."
2,maggie smith at the BBC,"IT IS A PITY I WON,T BE ABLE TO ENJOYTHIS DVD WITH MY FAVOURITE ACTRESSBUT WITH NO SUBTITLE IT IS NOTPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO UNDERSTANDALL THE DIALOGUESI WONDER WHY SO MANY INTE3RESTINGDVDS ARE FEATURES WITHOUT SUBTITUES,NOT EVEN IN ENGLISH WHICH WILL BEVERY HELPFUL INDEED"
3,I love Maggie Smith,This series was far too old for me and the subject matter is of really no interest. Entertaining though but would not buy more.
4,Why Not A Totally Live CD?,"This limited ""tour edition"" is a re-issue of the ""Mi Sangre"" CD. If you already have the ""Mi Sangre"" CD, the only thing new that you'll get are seven extra songs and a DVD video. If you're a hardcore fan of Juanes, this might be a worthwhile purchase even if you already have the ""Mi Sangre"" CD.I think labeling this CD as the ""tour edition"" is misleading. There are four ""live"" songs on this CD which are pretty good so I can't understand why they didn't release a completely ""live"" CD.The three videos on the DVD are MTV-type music videos. Again, I would have preferred live footage from his concert.Hopefully, the next time Juanes' label puts out a ""tour edition,"" they'll make it 100% live."
4,Its really good... but not what I expected.,"I'm a BIG fan of Juanes so obviously I'll say that its really good. But the truth is that this is the WHOLE ""Mi Sangre"" CD except for the live songs that he sings (which are really good), but like somebody else said, they should have released the CD with the DVD live, COMPLETELY, not just three songs. Oh well... If you buy it, I really hope u enjoy it as much as me.P.S.: Juanes has a great voice and he really knows how to put a good show, so if you have a chance to go see him in concert, I recommend you do that, its worth it."
4,works great,very quiet and the price was right on amazon. bought it to replace a burnt out fan motor. This one is smaller and quieter and doesn't heat up like the original one did.
4,Microphone Problems,"A lot of reviewers have been commenting that the microphone doesn't work, or it has to be very close to your mouth. I suspect that those comments have scared off a few, if not a lot of potential buyers.All microphones for singing are designed that way to variable degrees. The reason is to prevent the mic from picking up other sounds besides the singers voice. If your microphone picked up the sound coming from the Karaoke machine speakers there would be a loud screeching noise called feedback. The designers prevent this by allowing the microphone to pick up only the sound right in front of the microphone.It's not unusual for a mic of this type and price to need the singers lips to almost touch the microphone to be effective. More expensive versions allow a little more distance, but the principle remains the same.I hope this helps you to better make a decision."
2,Screen went belly-up quickly,"I bought this for my (then) 7-year-old for Christmas last year. She loves to sing and I thought this would be a great & fun way to improve her reading. The machine was fun while it lasted, but within about 6 months the monitor stopped working. Shortly after that, both plastic brackets that hold the microphones were broken off (first one, then the other). Disappointing."
1,doesnt work,"There is hardly any sound at all from the microphone you can not hear the person singing at all, we are taking it back. disapointed because it looks like a really good machine till you try to use it."
2,disappointed,My daughter received this machine for her 8th birthday and was thrilled when she opened it. We were extremely disappointed however when she tried it out and with the volume all the way up you could hardly hear her voice. It was a little better if she held the mic directly to her mouth but still it was low.It is an attractive machine with the lyrics displayed nicely on the monitor however if you can't hear the person trying to sing then what is the point.
1,Did not work,"Tape player did not work at all. Made a nice donation to local thrift shop, but I made sure they knew it did not work properly!"
2,If the microphone worked well it would be a great machine,"I was given this Singing Machine/karaoke machine as a gift.The monitor and the sound of the cdg were fine.It's the microphone that isn't.There is hardly any sound from the mike at all!It did increase when I cupped my hands around themouthpiece, but still not sufficient for a good sound.I tried to plug it in securely until I heard a clickas one reviewer stated, but it still didn't work well.I can hardly hear my voice regardless if the sound is allthe way up or lower.Its too late to return this to the gift giver.I feel this mike problem is a major detriment to it'susefullness.I will either trash it, or just use it to play CD's."
5,Cuero Sintetico Remo De 8.5 Pulgadas Para Bongo,"Excelente producto. De material muy resistente. Se puede afinar a tonos muy altos, sin el temor de que se vaya a romper. El sonido es impecable y nitido. Recomiendo este producto altamente..."
2,dated,"There is an insult or two that is amusing, but most are dated from the mid 60's and not funny anymore."
3,daughters mermaid doll,"I have a concern about this product, we purchased this toy for our 3 year old daughter and the barette that comes in the dolls hair should not be put on this doll. We had a terrible life threatening experience 4 days ago when she swallowed this barette, she came into the room where I was at and said that she had it stuck and could not get it out, she told me it was the green barette, I tried to get it out but was unable too! She swallowed it and it went through her system only to have to wait 3 days for it to do so and to find it in her stool. Thank God we still have her hear today because of this barette, I believe the doll is a cute toy but the barette should be recalled for a sure thing that children can and will choke on or the age should be changed, Hope that you take this concern to someone that can recall this and make it safer. Thank you for your help with this matter, Please let me know if I was able to help. Vickie dgillespie@huntel.net"
4,World Industries skate board,"My son loves the skate board. It was one of his birthday gifts. He rides it all the time, and it has held up to a lot of use. I priced boards, all over the place, the internet, board shops, local stores etc. This was by far the best price for a name brand.Thanks.."
3,world industries complete board,This is a good board for beginers and people who started skateboarding to see if it was fun... (I don't recommend this board for experienced skaters but it is pretty cheap and and easy to afford)
3,Good...there is better,"Shakira is a great entertainer. This is a good stadium concert, but the performance is a tad flat when you compare it to her MTV Unplugged DVD and CD. Check that one out- it is perfection!"
3,Shakira Fan,"I purchased this DVD based on the many positive reviews I read and the fact that it seemed to have more content than the Oral Fixation Tour DVD. I enjoyed the documentary showing the ""non performer"" side of Shakira as well as seeing a little taste of what it must be like to live her life. The concert was good, and definitely shows her as a younger performer. It's also nice that the CD of live music is included in the purchase. My only semi-criticism (trust me, I LOVE Shakira!!!) is the paucity of belly dancing that was featured. There were literally only 2 songs that featured longer belly dancing segments. I understand she is a singer first, but the dancing is her trademark so I was admittedly surprised that it was so minimal.All in all, it's still a great concert to put on for background music, but you won't be mesmerized and feel compelled to get up and dance. Her DVD from Paris is much better!"
5,It Doesn't Get Much Better Than This,"OK, I'll admit it: I bought this DVD because I like watching Shakira bellydance. But I soon discovered that I like listening to her almost as much as I like looking at her.Shakira puts on an amazing 90-minute performance in which she displays her considerable gifts as a singer, lyricist, dancer, and instrumentalist. It's hard to imagine one person having as many talents as this woman, not to mention being a major-league babe in the bargain!If you are a Shakira fan, this DVD is a MUST HAVE. Or if you simply enjoy great live performances, you will find that it doesn't get much better than this."
5,What can I say? Simply great !!!!,"This is best dvd made for a live show I've ever seen before. Quality of both of them, video and audio are spectacular, I felt I was re-living the concert again. And over everything, Shakira show us another way to see her life, not only like a singer and performing on the stage, besides being a normal person, you know smiling, crying, complaining and even groaning. It's just so cool to know your favorite performer in that way. I recommend this dvd a lot. You'll love it, and she looks .....sighs.....so pretty, brilliant and in good shape, come on, don't miss it."
4,Great Concert,"A very high energy concert. A must have for any Shakira fan. Although she is effectively a pop singer, the concert certainly has a rock edge to it. The only dissapointment was the documentary. It seemed so obviously staged, that it lowered my enjoyment of the DVD a little. Just a little... If not for that it would have been five stars."
3,Somewhat of a letdown,"The first and last songs are very good, since this is a DVD, the visual part is most important. A lot of the middle songs are just OK. I was expecting a lot more from this DVD, therefore, for me it was a bit of a letdown."
5,Her best concert so far!!!,"Attended this concert back in 2001 in Los Angeles and after going to her recent ""Sale El Sol"" tour i believe she did 5 times better 10 years ago!"
5,fantastic!!!,"She is the best musician..and beautiful woman.I have been her fan ever since saw this Shakira dvd!!!Best singer,best dancer and best SHAKIRA!!!!!!"
5,Just sorry it had to be a true story,"Awesome movie but its so sad that it really happened ,i don't see how any human being could kill a baby but that being said, its a super movie and and robert mitchum did an outstanding job portraying Gary Tyson as did the supporting cast in their roles .."
3,If they would just shut up it would be great...,"This CD could get five stars if the DJ's would just shut up and do what they're good at. When these guys get on the one-and-two they drop bombs. But there's just too much garbage on this CD for it to get more than three stars. Their skills are mad but they display them all too infrequently. I have to admit though, some of their banter is funny but most of it is just dumb. The last two tracks on this cd are great as is the Drunken Puss track, they bring back some awesome old-school beats.What they need to do is make a ""Best of"" cd of all the four or five Shiggar Fraggar Show cds that cuts out all the bull**** and is just solid scrathing tracks.For a much better display of turntabilsm check out the Return of The DJ Series I, II and III cds. These are incredible, with no babbling ... in between the tracks - just solid scratching and mixing."
4,Classic Turntablism,this is a classic work from the piklz crew. heavy skratches and deep melodies along with the crews own sense of style adds to this compilation. excellent beats blended and bended with heavy turntablism. a must for and DMC follower or table fan.
4,Scratchalicious,"Some dope beats and scratches from the pickles. buy this now, also check q-bert's album and stuff by the scratch perverts."
1,This Is Some Good Blues,"I have been a collector of blues for many years and finding Greg Serrato was like finding a treasure. His approach is fresh, guitar playing absolutely outstanding, and his voice equipped with a range that allows him to temper his songs with some interesting and pleasing sounds. I only hope he continues to make records!"
2,Ultra Rapid Charger warranty & reliability,"This charger has a limited 3 year warranty. Warning: if you do not register the product within 30 days of purchase, the warranty is good for 1 year only. I purchased it on March 9, 2006. The charger stopped working on Oct 29, 2007. It had moderate usage during that time (maybe once a month for 4 AA batteries). It was easy to use and worked fairly well while it worked. I would not purchase from this company again. Based on this experience, I would not trust the quality and reliability of their products."
2,Unreliable power supply,"This product worked fine for me for about a year until the power supply failed. This was very inconvenient, and caused my client to have a gap in their data backup. Iomega were good enough to send me a replacement.After about another year the replacement power supply failed. Another gap in my clients data backup, not to mention a small dent in their confidence in me. This time Iomega were unwilling to replace, and so I had to buy another replacement power supply."
2,Frustrating speed makes REV obsolete,"I've purchased 3 REV drives for my company, and used them all extensively. But as of 2006, REV technology appears obsolete. Why? The speed. Write speeds are frustratingly slow, and read speeds aren't impressive, either.Today, the new USB portable hard drives from Seagate (100GB portable drive) and Western Digital (80GB) are a much better option. Yes, they're a bit more cost in terms of dollars per GB, but unless your time has absolutely no value, you'll make up the cost difference in time savings when reading or writing files. Plus, remember that with the REV drive, you have to spend $350 or so up front just for the drive alone. The 35GB cartridges must be purchased separately at additional cost. (At well over $1 per GB, by the way.)Bottom line: REV was ahead of its time for about 18 months. But today, due to speed problems and size limitations, the current 35GB REV technology is obsolete. Go with portable hard drives instead."
5,One BIG Zip Disk,"This is being marketed as a backup solution, and that's fine, it's a great one and, depending upon what you're using, maybe a little expensive. However, don't overlook (and this isn't obvious at all from their marketing) that this is still just like one very fast, and, very, VERY BIG password protected Zip Drive! Iomega has finally delivered what they promised (and NEVER delivered at 2.0 USB!!!) with the Peerless several years ago. This unit is really small -- the disks are smaller than Zip disks -- and if they keep up with their plans of doubling the capacity every 18 months or so, they may really be onto something. Installation was totally unremarkable and exactly as promised. It comes with a version of Norton Ghost made especially for the Rev. Following the included directions step-by-step re: the Ghost backup is very important."
5,The Floppy of the Future,"When I first unpacked this , I was amazed to see just how compact it was. The software loaded without a hitch and I was up and running. This is a dream come true. It backs up my data as fast if not faster than my old external drive. I bought this because on my job we switched from our old Zip 250 to these, so I needed this at home for work, but wow It does so much more. I loaded all my sons pc games onto it so I could free up the pc's internal drive and they work just as well. I just pop out his disk and place in mine when I need to work. I love it, Thanks Iomega for a great device."
1,Overpriced,"Do yourself a favor, and buy this magazine subscription directly from the Minerva magazine website. You will pay $50 versus the $71.71 on Amazon for 6 issues. Sorry, Amazon! Maybe you will lower your prices."
1,"I love the Minerva publication. At least, as far as I can remember it.","On November 29, 2012, you sent me a ship-confirm order for Minerva magazine. Without theslightest intent of sarcasm, I believe a sailing ship would be faster. WHERE IS IT?"
3,Subscription Delay,"I cannot understand for the life of me why anything should take 12-16 weeks to begin getting a subscription. I got this for my uncle who is a true history buff and it will take 3-4 months for him to get his 1st magazine. I tried to buy a copy of this at one of the book stores or stands to show him what he would be getting and could find it nowhere. I had to print the page from Amazon to get anything. This is a wonderful, high caliber magazine and it shouldn't take this long to get. Can't something be done about this?"
3,Going to be delayed...,"In case anyone hasn't heard, this movie is going to be delayed indefinitely. Anyone who's read the book (which, by the way, is HILARIOUS) will know why - the plotline involves moving a small nuke through the chaotic airport security of Miami International Airport.... I'm sure, if it's ever released, it will be funny, but now is not the right time to see it..."
3,"Okay, ...","This movie is the epitome of cliched humor. Yes, you can guess every joke that is about to occur. If you like movies with spoof humor, this one is for you. For the rest of us, save your money and wait for the video."
1,Big trouble & To young to die,Both of these dvd's were from foreign countries and will not play in my dvd player.
2,"Good cast, Bad movie!","The storyline is so poor, it wont' work unless a story-teller explains what is happening once in a while. The cast holds their own, but it does not add up to much."
2,Not the greatest comedy but it has its moments,"First of all I want to start off by saying I think this deserves 2 1/2 stars but that is not a option and it definately doesn't deserve 3 by my ratings. There are many ""main characters"" in this movie and while Tim Allen might have been the biggest name in the film, I found the two dumb criminals (Johnny Knoxville and Tim Sizemore) along with Dennis Farina, a hit man, stole the show. The criminals really do act some lines well. Some jokes however were so bad I almost wanted to stop the movie, but rest assured, it gets better as it progresses. I'll leave the plot summary to the editorial review, but overall I'd say if you want to rent a few movies over a weekend or something, this isn't a bad choice, but if you're looking to buy a comedy, go a different direction. (I didn't watch the special features on the DVD but there weren't many.)"
2,Unpsetting.,"""Big Trouble"" was a big let down. I expected a really funny movie. But this movie was just down right stupid. ...This movie was short (85 mintues) but that was good because I could not take it any more. The acting was not that good. I wonder why Jason Lee took that role. Becuase he is allways funny in movies and in this movie his chactor was not funny buy I don't blame him I mean it's not his falut because the script was written every badly. Tim Allen, I hate to say it but he is washed up. Now of his live-action movies have I liked. Renne Russo has had two straight duds (the other ""Showtime). Omara Eeps who is a good actor, he can't do comedy. Johnny Knockville was not funny like on ""Jackass"". Hevy D go back to the rap game. Tom Sisemore ...[was no good] The stroy line and plot were okay. This movie could have been funny with the cast but the script and directing were so bad it did not work. This movie is just a let down and I do not recomend it any one...."
4,Big Trouble,"Love the book and the movie did it justice ... Its not a ""deep"" film, but perfectly portrays Dave Barry's humor - Loved the actors!!"
3,Big Trouble DVD Review,"This movie was close to being great. It has a great cast and a decent story, but just cannot quite put it all together. It is entertaining, but ultimately forgettable."
4,Timing is Everything,"This movie was scheduled to come out in September 2001. Given its plot (how two morons manage to smuggle a suitcase nuke onto a commuter plane without realizing what they've got), it was an inevitable non-starter after 9/11.That's a shame, because this movie is well made and absolutely hilarious. It based on a novel by Dave Barry, and it plays like one of his columns. There are goofy teenagers, confused hitmen, a hippie in a tree, and Renee Russo. A great movie, and a good addition to my DVD collection."
3,"Not as good as the book, but still very funny","This is a funny movie! If you haven't read the book, see the movie, then read the book. But do both!"
4,More like Big Fun!,"This is a great movie! Everybody and their mother is in it and it is just full of funny stuff! Even if you don't like Tim Allen, you will like this movie!"
3,The Chase That Falls on It's Face! !,"With a crew of such actors as Tim Allen, Rene Russo, Dennis Farina, & Janeane Garofalo, you would expect a flick to be a roll-in-the-aisles laugh riot, but, having seen it now, it no longer surprises me that I can't remember having seen this groaner advertized in theaters, above & beyond the fact it was produced in Canada.Even the cover art is a misnomer, and one of the main reasons I bought this in a deal on the net, without investigating first. What I thought might have been a Sopranos'Mob satire (and, unlike the cover art, NOBODY wears a leather jacket), turns out to be a slap-dash redneck swamp rat chase to recapture a Russian nuclear weapon which leaves you wanting more of just about EVERYTHING INCLUDING MOVIE( the running time for this second-rater only adds up to the claimed 85 minutes if you add in the titles and end credits BOTH!)It does have a few decent laughs, but it definitely AIN'T worth the asking price!"
2,read the book,While the movie had it's moments it does not compare to the book. Then movies seldom do. Read the book pass on the movie....
3,soso,"this was unexpectedly pretty funny and it would have earned 5 stars if it wasnt for the ... bad guys. tim allen , ben foster , and jason lee were my faves in this. it has a plot but unfortunately it ... it has a story narrated by tim allen who plays elliot a down on his luck ad exec. his son played with power by ben foster hates him for devorcing his mom. jason lee plays a frito loving hippie."
5,One of my favorites,"This is considered a stupid movie by some, but I can't watch it enough. Great movie if you like goofy action comedies"
3,OK,"My bf and I really did enjoy this movie...it was funny, and had a great plot and characters. The quality was ok..."
2,What potential!?!,"A film full of good actors, a wacky plot written by a funny author and directed by someone who knows all about self conscious humor. That's the potential, but this movie feels like it never gets off the ground because there are so many subplots that detract from where the plot actually takes the characters(all of them) at the end that it feels subverted and half baked. It makes the audience wonder why this wasn't made into a television series instead(at least in this incarnation). It is funny at times and heartwarming as well, but you know what's wrong with it"
1,Not worth your time,"My advice is to not waste your time with this movie. It was just downright stupid and wasn't funny in my opinion. You'd think with Tim Allen, Rene Russo, and several other very good actors and actresses that it would be a great movie. The 'Big Trouble' with it is that I think it largely relied on the cast and was thin in many other areas."
1,one of the worst movies I've ever seen,"This is one poor excuse for a comedy. There were very few jokes I laughed at. I wasn't put off by the slight terrorism theme, but other material, like shooting the guy in the foot in the name of a federal executive order, just don't deserve laughter. The acting was decent, but the story is slow, predictable, and just not funny. If you find yourself easily amused by this movie, then you should get yourself cattlebranded with ""Property of Hollywood."""
3,Japanese Reissue,"The same track list of US version. The japanese reissue of 2004 includes 17 albums, all of 70s, including ""Here at Last... Bee Gees live, a long out of print, and 2 albums of 90s, ""Size Isn't Everything"", ""Tamanho no é tudo"" and ""Still Waters"" of 1997.1. Paying The Price Of Love2. Kiss Of Life3. How To Fall In Love, Pt. 14. Omega Man5. Haunted House6. Heart Like Mine7. Anything For You8. Blue Island9. Above And Beyond10. For Whom The Bell Tolls11. Fallen Angel12. Decadance"
5,My favorite book of all time.,"It's historical, emotional, raw, and beautiful. I honestly can't say anything more about it. Read it for yourself and you'll fall in love like I did."
3,"Great topic, borders on boring.","This book was recommended to me by a friend who usually shares the same taste in books. I must say I was disappointed with the way the author handled his charcters, they were either violent or smaltzy. I honestly lost interest after reading half of the book."
2,disappointing book,"Read this for my bookgroup. Questions at the end were pretty basic, and the book seemed to go on and on. Very disappointing, in that it really had nothing to do with the Taj Mahal. Would not recommend this book unless you were really desperate!"
2,A trite love story disguised a 'historical' fiction,"I had high hopes for this book considering the reviews it's gotten on Amazon. I was disappointed! The book is a pretty tired love story placed in loosely in the historical setting of how the Taj Mahal was built. I was surprised by how one dimensional all the characters were. Plus, not only was the historical context flawed and unrealistic, but the story itself just plodded along uninterestingly, until the inevitable conclusion. I read this for a book club, and otherwise doubt I would have finished it. I would not recommend this to lovers of rich and intricate historical fiction!"
2,"More architecture, please!!","A rather disappointing love story, more about violence and war than a true love story. I had hoped to learn more about the building of this beautiful building, but got war and family feud. A love story written by a man...give me more love, not war. Had wanted to recommend this book for my book club selection, but lost interest in the story itself, and will not recommend it."
4,I was surprised this story hadn't been fictionalized before,"I read this book for my book group. It is a touching love story, and very well researched. The author called in to our book group to discuss with us. We're looking forward to reading his next book."
1,anachronistic beyond endurance - arrrgh!,"I understand that historical fiction fills in with artistic imagination. I do not accept John Shors complete disregard for historical values and 17th century Indian culture. He writes a compelling tale with special appeal to the adolescent female, but he misrepresents the time and place egregiously. He ought to be ashamed of himself.I struggled to page 126 before I had the meltdown that inspired this review. No Indian Emperor in 17th century India would have counseled his daughter as follows:He seemed to consider my words. ""Never deny yourself love, my child. For to deny love is to deny God's greatest gift. And who are we to deny God?""Let me summarize my reaction this way. I have more confidence in and enjoyment of sliding into Alice's rabbit hole in Lewis Carroll's writing. This Marble Sky fell on me and squashed me flat.Betsy Friedman"
1,Way over rated!,"Given the numerous great reviews for this book, I had high hopes and recommended to my book club. Unfortunately, we were sadly disappointed -- everyone hated it! There was no character development and the story dragged terribly."
3,Characters are too one-dimensional,"This book was a quick and enjoyable read, but it only gets three stars from me because 1) it's a little light on actual history, and 2) I thought the characters were way too one-dimensional. Everyone in the book is either entirely pure and wonderful (Jahanara, her parents, Isa...) or evil incarnate (her brother, her husband). The author should have made the ""evil"" characters more nuanced. Why was the brother so evil and cruel, for instance? Lack of nuance makes the writing seem immature."
3,"Just a love story, nothing more","I was kind of disappointed that most of it is fiction (or at least the most important parts that form the basis of the story). You are thought to believe that this is based on a true story, but it is highly embellished, and culturally inaccurate in many cases. It kind of ruined the mystery of the Mughal Empire, the Taj Mahal, etc. for me. It is an easy read though, and somewhat entertaining, so if you like these sorts of love stories (but more on the side of a melodramatic soap opera) then you'll probably enjoy it."
4,Awesome adventure/love story,"A beautifully described account of the building of the Taj Mahal. A little of everything: love story, action & adventure, family feuds. We had a GREAT themed bbok club meeting with indian food and dress. Overall the book was rated 8.5 out of ten. Vey absorbing, well done."
2,Couldn't finish,"This was our Book Club selection or I probably wouldn't have picked it. Although somewhat educational, I found it to be more of a romance novel than a historical novel. I thought it was boring."
4,Insight Into Another Place and Another Time,This historical novel imparts information that most of us probably never knew. The book is educational as well as packed with history. The great love story adds to the plot and provides us with a role model for our own lives.
4,Excellent historical novel,This is an excellent historical novel of India. A love story and anexact history of the Taj Mahal. Expands over a long period of timeuntil it is completely built.Well written
2,American Love Story? Yes. Historical Novel About Taj Mahal? No.,"A modern American young man visited the Taj Mahal with his wife and was inspired to write a love story. Alas, he knowns almost nothing about the Mughal history or the harem culture. And, unfortunately, he chose a period and a people that were well documented. If you disregard the names and places and the era and substitute them with a spoiled rich girl in a modern small town America, it's an interesting love story. If you expect it to having anything to do with anyone connected with the Taj Mahal or the Mughal courts, you will be sadly disappointed. The inaccuracies are everywhere. Who was it that advised writers to stick to the things they know? Good advice!"
2,"Great plot, but where's the character development?","I agree with the reviewer who said the characters were either the essence of goodness or vile and evil. Yes, the book is a great page turner and the plot is intricate and interesting, but without dimension to the characters, it's not a memorable novel. I'm surprised by all the praise being thrown around, frankly. Maybe I just need character driven fiction to make reading worth my while--for a good yarn with no depth, I'd rather watch TV."
3,not historically accurate,"I understand this book is listed as historical fiction, but when an author chooses to write about people whose lives can be fact checked that author probably shouldn't write things that are totally inaccurate. For example, the protagonist of this novel, Jahanara, was a Mughal princess living at a time when such princesses were not permitted to marry (Akbar, an earlier Mughal emperor, imposed this prohibition). Yet the novel has her married off to a lecherous drunken lout and much of the novel is spent discussing her miserable marriage. There are of course many other inaccuracies (for instance, Jahanara was severely burned in real life but the novel makes no mention of this) but the marriage one to me is the worse since it is such a huge plot device. Overall the writing is tolerable, even if most of the characters seem like they are reading poetry while conversing."
5,Not a chick book...,"I am a guy approaching geezerhood, and was given this book by my daughter-in-law. When I finally got around to reading it, I could not put it down. This is so much more than a love story (which is pretty neat in itself). Well-written, interesting, and touching."
2,Not engaging,"The events and history surrounding the building of the Taj-Mahal are fascinating, but this book is written in such a way that it is difficult to discern what, if any, of it is based on historical fact. The characters seem anachronistic, and are flatly drawn. A good idea, this work, but not engaging or emotionally satisfying."
1,A disappointing book in every way,"I bought this book because I have enjoyed John Shors' later books. I disagree with the majority of the reviews. The characters are not fleshed out at all; rather they all do the same things from beginning to end; that is, if it ever comes to an end. I have been reading it for two weeks. Once started, I always read a book through, but this one has been tough to stay with. The theme is constant: the good son who refuses to bend, and pays for it; the good daughter who seldom makes any sense at all as she seems to be more of an irritant than a person who accomplishes anything; the weak father who can't keep control of his own kingdom, and instead allows it to be conquered by the evil son. It has gotten me interested in the Taj Mahal itself, but I'd like, if possible, to read something more accurate about its building. I consider this a first book, and like many first books, it should have stayed in the author's drawer, out of sight."
5,Great read!,Great read! Would read others from this author. Story was very fast paced and interesting. Beautiful setting. Just get it
2,Just average,"Beneath a Marble Sky (John Shors) is not a bad read, but not riveting either. I never felt like I just couldn't put it down - in fact, it's taken weeks to get through it! The storyline and history about the building of the Taj Mahal are interesting, but Shors' writing is overworked and tedious at times. It was okay, just not great."
5,Awesome!,"I can't add much to what's already been said in all of these reviews. My wife read this book and loved it. She said that I would enjoy it, and though a bit skeptical, I picked it up, and very quickly became hooked. This book is amazing. It reminded me of The Kite Runner, which I recently read. Beneath a Marble Sky, though a love story, is a major page turner, with plenty of surprises and action. I read it nonstop during a four-hour flight, and was disappointed when I landed. It's that good!"
4,Loved the setting.,The pacing was great. It wasn't exactly 'literary' but it was a great love story. AND the story of the Taj Mahal! Excellent.
5,cd,"this man has a great voice , I only wish the people in the USA could enjoy his talentIf it wasn't for friends in the Uk I would have never heard his voice and glad I did"
5,Beautiful Voice,"Found Shayne Ward on YouTube and feel in love with his voice. Purchased his CD. Excellent! I would have loved to hear more of his own songs, but loved to listen to him. Took longer to ship, but was worth the wait.JoAnne NY"
3,Britain of the far future where man has reverted barbarism,"""It's about England long after technological civilization has gone. The way civilization ended is named as ""atomic bombing"". Gibbon describes it as leaving residues that behave exactly like radioactive waste/fallout, except that he way overstates the length of time they'd stay dangerously hot. The book ends with London's surviving power source (not described in detail) going up in something very like a Hiroshima-sized nuclear blast.""Heroine is projected into a terrifying Britain of the far future where man has reverted to barbarism and strange mutations, the product of past nuclear wars, roam the land. "". one of the most impressive post- holocaust stories written between the wars."" - Stableford, Scientific Romance in Britain 1890-1950, p. 245."
4,Happy Customer,I was very happy with the price and how quickly I received the merchandice! I would order from them again!!
5,Muy Bueno,Me encanta la musica y sobre todo colecciono videos todos los titulos que pueda conseguir y esta compra es uno de ellos
4,For nostalgia mostly,"In their hey-day, I was not a Poison fan. I didn't like Winger, Warrant, or Bon Jovi either. But now come to think of it, everytime I went to a party or hung out, Poison always seemed to be playing somehow. So I picked up this video to remember the good old days of smoking dope, underage drinking, long hair, and zero responsibilities. I hope all those girls in the videos still look good, the girls I know from back then don't."
4,GREAT FOR TODDLERS,My two year old son wants to take this book everywhere! He loves pointing at the things that are in the book and is so proud because he then shows us where in the book the picture is.
3,What happened to this album??????,"Everywhere I look, I see mention of this album, song lists for this album, release dates for this album. But in almost 10 years of looking, I have never seen this album actually for sale. Was this ever actually released? Is there a digital download available anywhere? I LOVE The Pacers, and this album has all of their rare songs that I would love to have."
5,I'm also from that little town !!!!,"I just love this book !!!! I also was just one of Dr. Hobbie's babies!!! Even though I was born in 1956, some things I do remember my parents talking about that are in this book !! And today I work in the ""Old Sodus School"". My mother used to go to school there. Today in the year 2011 Dynalec Corp. is in the building !! I wish a movie could be done about this book !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Biased but interesting,"Insightful about prison life. A little self-serving and exaggerated. The author says he's never so much as had a ticket before and later he reminds us he has been in gunfights before.He's very upset he went to prison,but I doubt all the conspiracies took place as he relates them. The judge shows the prosecutor some leg? You can't even see what a judge is wearing below the chest level in the courtroom he is describing."
3,"Compelling story, terrible editing","Growing up in the north and spending a number of childhood summers in Marion, I am satisfied that Skip's story is pretty accurate. Some of the blanks he necessarily had to fill in. My beef is that the time line in the book veers all over the place and it's often hard to follow the players and the events. It could have been organized much better. Also, there are times when Skip's passion leads him to minute details that don't add to the telling of the story. In my opinion, a top notch editor could have made this a best seller.I don't doubt that Skip brought some troubles on himself and he acknowledges that he would do things differently a second time around. But, Skip gets the important stuff right. How much more can we ask of ourselves? Well worth reading."
5,It's a cinemascope blockbuster in a book!,"As a movie lover, I was intrigued with the theme of this book -- how movies have shaped our culture, our thinking -- and was prepared for a heavy, textbook-like reading. As I read, though, I was overwhelmed with O'Briens style, his sterling craftsmanship in describing the feelings and emotions of the movies. I would literally stop after every few lines and shake my head in amazement. As a writer, I am jealous of his skill. As a reader, I am eager to read it again.Steve Martin said (in L.A. STORY) that ""a kiss may not be the truth, but it's what we wish was the truth."" I do not know if O'Brien's book is THE truth about movies in the modern mind but, oh, how I hope that it is."
3,Reaching Too Hard,I have to be the dissenting opinion based on the other posted reviews. Frankly I felt this book was well written and fairly insightful but in many respects the author was reaching too hard for profundity and some of the connections and reference points he used seemed rather arbitrary to me. In addition there are many films that were overlooked that could have added to the analysis and made the book more meaningful to a wider readership.
1,crap,"it's cheap piece of chinese crap. My nephew hates it! bad design, my fart is louder than this crap. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!"
2,won't fire any kind of caps well,"The description says it will shoot roll caps, but there is no spindle to hold them and no track to guide them. It was really designed to shoot strip caps - one cap inserted at a time, but the seat for the cap is mis-designed such that it cannot sit deep enough for the hammer to sufficiently impact the cap. I tried dremmeling the neck down a bit so the cap would sit deeper, but it turns out the center post is still too short. The metal parts of the gun feel decently substantial and grip is plastic / fake wood which is OK. In any case, my son still likes to run around with a pirate hat and this gun."
3,Usable toy,Came with a few nicks in the wood but otherwise a straight forward toy to play with. The gun can shoot caps but not a lot of strength in the trigger.
5,"Not gold, or any other metal but exquisite Silk","The only mistake with this cd is the chosen name, because gold reminds us something hot...exciting. Calleja's voice has nothing of those things, it reminds us of something very pure. Purity is not golden, it's silvered. His voice is just like the most exquisite Silk for our ears, fresh water! It's so good to see that in this generation we have a lot of different kinds of tenor voices, we're all well served. The impression I got when I was listening to this cd was that I was listening to Beniamino Gigli nowadays. It was so moving! So, I think that the right name for this cd should be ""THE SILKY VOICE"""
1,"if you're reading this, it's not too late","If I want to hear how good Director is, I'd go to the Macromedia web site. This book does not go into the specific. It tells you WHAT you can do with Director not actaully HOW to do it. The money I spent on this book does not worth the education I received from it. Oh well, Director 7 is coming out by the time you read this, lt's hope these guys would do a better job at actaully writing a reference book instead of a brouchure."
5,this book is a must read,This book is about my grandfather's story thru my grandmother's eyes it is a must read. My dad give tours about the Holocaust and we take these book's about his dad my grandfather and grandmother and give them to people. If anyone is interested in more about this book and there lives please go to Jay Ipson holocaust survivor on Facebook. Thanks
5,"Very moving story, but to know that family survived is the best ending.","Hard to read, but then visited the Holocaust Museum the Ipp family started in my hometown . So they survived !"
5,"Dark, Ambient Music","Just as the title says theses are funeral songs, plain and simple. The artwork through out the album has sort of a Gothic/Victorian style to it. Also the artwork fits the music, very dark and foreboding. There is alot of good songs on this CD, some of my favorites being The End of Hunger by Tertium Non Data, Pannoczka by Agnivolok and lastly The Procession Of Souls by Shinjuku Thief. If you really want to get the feel of this music then sit in your room, shut the door, pull the curtains and turn your stereo up. This isn't upbeat music and needless to say after a full listen, you won't be very upbeat either."

1,"Gross generalizations, huge assumptions and typos","Save your money. I ordered this because of all the glowing reviews I had read. I was astounded with how poorly written the book is. The author makes wild assumptions about ""childbirth myths"" detailing (I'm assuming) catholic views of Eve and Mary. She attacks and generalizes the medical profession. Even after these and other unsupported claims I thought I could still use the relaxation exercises, but when she said that when the fetus kicks and moves it's because the mother or parents are experiencing stress and tension I was absolutely appalled. The fetus moving is a good sign of normal cognitive development, not something parents should try to subdue or about which they should feel guilt. I can't support something so utterly uninformed...especially for $60.00. It would be nice to be able to purchase products that balance ""alternative"" and ""conventional"" birthing practices."
4,"No sugar, good quality.","The product is very dry. If you're okay with that, then buy it. Good quality."
4,Wall Sconce,Very good value for the product. Using it as the light fixture behind a metal sculpture. Produced the desired effect. Just enough space to use a CFL 60 watt equivalent bulb.
3,Classic Textbook,This textbook is fine for the classroom. It is detailed and fulfills the needs for a student in the classroom.
5,I recommend this book,"I like how this book presents every topic especially about transfers, wheelchair and assistive devices...I like the illustrations, tables and colored pictures...very helpful and informative..."
3,Not for absolute beginners,"This book assumes that the reader is familiar with human anatomy, particularly the skeletal and muscular systems. Technical jargon like: glenohumeral joint, medial epicondyle, scapulothoracic etc. are used without further explanation.Other than this, the instructions of various exercise and usage of ambulation devices are detailed and concise.I would recommend the prospective reader to read up on human anatomy and physiology before approaching this book."
2,Beware Redundant Collection,"Don't get this CD. Instead, get ""Music for the Spanish Kings,"" also from Virgin. The latter has two disks for the same price, and one of them is identical to ""Viva Rey Ferrando."" The booklet in ""Viva Rey"" is bigger, however, and includes the lyrics.Secular Renaissance music from Italy and Spain is really delightful stuff, and Hesperion XX or XXI is a top notch ensemble."
2,Funny Accent,"I had hoped to be drawn into the novel and ""see"" the events from the primary character's point of view. What I found was a very linear presentation of events. Though the premise of this book is touted as the story of woman who falls for men old enough to be her father, I found that this story was rather about a woman who continually falls for egocentric men who would be less than good for her, no matter what their age. And while it is often said that women who date older men have ""father issues"", the trail the author takes to make this point was a little abrupt to suit me. While this is a very well-written book, I was somewhat disappointed in the content presented, thus the two-star rating."
4,Sparsely eloquent. A book ripened near perfection.,"Barbara Shulgasser-Parker writes a novel seemingly devoid of extras. No extraneous jabber to divert you from her prose. No inessential thoughts that clutter her focus...Whether her point is important probably lies somewhere with her subject. Since I don't care a whit about a woman drawn to her father's agemate, the substance of the novel came from a masterful ability to shake all the extra words off a page. What remains is a delight for the weekend socialogist...complex, delicious, insightful and succinctly robust."
2,Would make a better article than a book,"This is a fairly superficial overview book. It seems that it could be condensed into a 5 page article and appear in a magazine. I find more helpful information by reading the industry magazines in this product space. The book is a good intro for high school students, but not college students or professionals."
3,Dated. Would have been a decent overview a while back.,"This is a turn-of-the-century overview of forms processing that is now out of date. Still an OK read at a very high level, but if you're working in the industry in any technical capacity, then this book is far, Far, FAR too basic (and out of date) for you."
5,must,"Man, do thses boys rock! Like a frosty glass of beer on a hot summer day, they refresh and go down fast. Songs that are toe tapping and catchy and sometimes a tad cliche, but always with a new twist that keep them from being predictable. But which is better: the CD or seeing them live? Lead singer/Songwriter Anders Thomsen is just as sexy to look at as he is to listen to.His voice is just as smooth as the Tennesse Whiskey he's sings about and brings to mind a dozen country voices from a long time ago.Combine that with solid, sinewy guitar, and a ballsy rhythm section of cartoon inspired Mark Miller on bass and the sure footed, jaw droppin' drums of Mike Smith and you have country music to inspire the most die hard city raised rock fan to move South and become a ""Johnny Walker Redneck."" This debute CD is no nonsense, but fun-filled, and begs for a follow up real soon. Forget ""alt country"" and forget ""heavy western"", this is the first album o! f a new breed of country that has yet to be named."
3,The Pig in the Spigot,"I loved this book! I used it at the end of the year with my HA third graders. I think it is more appropriate for 4th or 5th graders. Children need to have some knowledge of spelling to get the jokes. However, I would caution you that there is one page that just really isn't appropriate for a classroom, but that is easily skipped."
1,No Wit- No Sense-No Vote,"This book was not enjoyed by either of my children. It is so ridiculous that children in the age range for whom its written think its stupid, and the young ones who tolerate witless nonsense don't understand the meaning of the words. I have an eleven year old and a four year old, both of which were bored by the second page. The word search within words is a great concept, but I expected there to be some sense about it, so the kids could be entertained AND challenged by the text. I am very disappointed."
3,Item great; shipping fee is exorbitant,"The product works exactly as advertised. Does a great job deterring mice and doesn't disturb resident dogs or people.Problem is that Lentek charged six shipping fees for an order of six products that came in one box (they don't weigh much), and each shipping fee was approximately the same price as the product so that the actual cost to the buyer is double the advertised price. Lentek's shipping fee policy needs serious overhaul. I won't buy from them again until it is changed."
1,No results so far,"Have used the repeller for 3 weeks . So far have noticed maybe a slight decrease in mouse activity, but they are definitely still there. Will update after a month. Am disappointed, but will persevere."
1,It does not seem to bother my garden rats,"I have a tomato garden in my backyard. The tomatoes are eaten or damaged by rats that are about 5 to 6 inches long. I used Victor rat trap without any catches even though the trap was set off. Hence, I bought this device and another kind of rat trap from Amazon. Using long power cord extensions, I turned on and placed this device within 3 feet directly in front of the new rat trap and the old Victor trap baited with cheese. However, the traps were set off and cheese was eaten as usual. Obviously, this device does not bother the rats at all. Thus, I've to return it."
1,NO SUPPORT,"Buyer Beware. There are no drivers available for using this scanner with Windows Vista or Win 7. If you need a boat anchor, it's fine, but that's all its good for. HP does not support their own equipment, so I won't ever be buying another HP product again."
2,BREAKS AFTER TWO YEARS,"We had this camera for almost two years and it broke. The screen just went black (although you could see the menu). We had even pre-ordered just when it was coming out. Overall the camera has been good and the only 10x optical zoom out there. I have had problems with the blurr feature that won't turn off. However, having to pay over $100 for Nikon to fix our camera is a waste. I had heard someone else had the same problem in the same time frame. I had a Minolta for years with no problems and am disappointed in the quality of this one that has such expensive repairs."
4,You don't need more than that,"It has every thing, loaded with features (manual setting is hard).Slightly big in size, not user freindly like coolpix 5900 preowned.Very delicate, warranty is not clear wheather it's 1 day or 60 or 90 or 365 days I don't know (made in Indonesia shocked me hopfully nothing happen)At the end I am happy with it, my kids are happy with it and You don't need more than that."
5,better than i expected,"excelent zoom, excelent quality, compact for the zoom size. great handling, easy to use. beautiful. the rotating body makes it easy to take pictures of yourself or in awesome angles. pre-programmed modes work really fine and allow you to do well in basically all situations. some manual controls make it fun to operate. some difficulties to focus when in macro mode but you learn how to do it. it misses control of apperture."
1,Unacceptable,I purchased this camera because I wanted a camera small enough to carry in my pocket but had a 10X zoom. I am an artist and I use a cameras to take pictures to paint from. The S10 does not have a viewfinder and on a bright day I can not see the image in the LCD screen. I purchased a folding shield but it did not help. The camera is totally unacceptable for outdoor use and who needs a 10X zoom for indoor.
3,Looks good,I also have Coolpix`S6 after using zoom for many times crashed OOO. This one looks amazing but the body of the camera too plastic and very much sensetive. If you drop it you will drop it.
1,nikon coolpix S10,Just the camera I wanted but I could not load the nikon program in my computer. I returned to Beach Camera and they were very prompt on the refund without a restocking fee.
2,Low Budget,This was a low budget movie. The actors did not quite fit their roles. Some of the guy actors were in a role that they could not get woman but their looks would say other wise. Premise was good but it was hard to get into.
2,family --one to disown,"its always nice to have compilations of various spinoffs of such a great band. however, this is a blatant attempt to just pad their wallets. for a casual fan-sure, this is ok to have and it will help with furthering their interest but for collectors stay away. fanatics of which I am!-have pretty much all of this covered. there is still some offshoot albums that have not been reissued and I for one am getting tired of repetition!!! they have already brought out SOLO FLYTE which was fine summation of selected odds and ends. FAMILY and SOLO FLYTE do have there differences but this could have been so much better. how about it LABELS?---if your going to dig into vaults--trying looking around!!!!!"
4,Great!!!!,"This is a great book. The L5R system is back, improved, and with no D20 present. The history is all here, although the summary is a bit brief (You'll probably want to get a more details from the 3 storyline books, Time of the Void, Hidden Emperor, and Four Winds).I would have given the book a 5, if not for the numerous typos. Misspellings and bad grammar are present throughout, and although they are not hard to figure out, they are annoying. What is a problem is the accidental retention (from an earlier phase of editing) of an entire section which not only was not supposed to be included, but outright contradicts info found elsewhere in the book. Shame on Alderac for skimping on quality control and copy editing.Nevertheless, if you like RPGs, you should get this, though you may want to wait for a new printing."
1,Ripped off,"From the display on the amazon site, it is not apparent what the size of the package is. I paid approximately what I would pay for 50 pounds of flour for a 4 oz package of baking mix - plus outrageous shipping on top of that. I never expected to encounter such cheating on Amazon and this gives me doubt about continuing to purchase on Amazon - especially groceries - unless I know exactly what it is I am buying. I will certainly not purchase from this seller ever again."
5,traitor,do you hear me? i don't accept it. escpecially when i send you an outline almost twenty years ago about this subject and you send me a form letter! Thanks to Youtube I won;'t be the onlly one you hippocriatye!
4,Agreed,"I really enjoyed this book. I wasn't sure I would. I didn't enjoy all the Thrawn novels before and didn't like some Timothy Zahn's novels, but I really got into this book. It has a dual story that comes together at the end. I'm not going to go into a long plot summary. Amazon and other reviewers have already did that. I liked how we finally got to see how Thrawn got involved with the Republic. I was intrigued by C'boath's Jedi philosophies and how he relates to others. I agreed with a lot of the reviewers that I felt Anakin and Kenobi were thrown in there just to say they were there. They didn't really lend anything to the story. I recommend this book to Star Wars fans and it does make Survivor's Quest more understandable."
3,"Good author, bad story",Will someone please tell me why they are still churning out pre-empire stuff after Revenge of the Sith?I just don't like the concept of Outbound Flight and frankly I couldn't care less about what happened to the members of the expedition. I am proud to consider myself a Star Wars Geek and the vast majority of this book bored me to death.Another odd thing here was the use of Kenobi and Skywalker. Whats the use of including them in the story if they are just going to leave Outbound Flight and disappear from the narrative?There are two points I liked A. The evolution of the Darth Sidedious character and just how deep he was into everything. I mean he didn't just move behind the scenes in one or two spots he was directing everything.B. The thing that made the book readable for me was Thrawn. He always was a well drawn character and a brilliant tactician and I'm glad to see that the trend is continued here.
4,"Good, then again,","I really liked the story, and the way in which the author incorporated elements of the prequel movie episodes into the book. The characters were interestingly written, especially Thrawn and C'boath, though the story still did not address what I really wanted to know about, and that is how Thrawn became a leader in the Empire, I don't think that book has been written yet. It would also be interesting to found out who cloned C'boath and some of his adventures in the years between Episode 2 and the earlier Zahn book, Heir to the Empire. Overall a decent read, but it wandered a lot and seemed to have much filler material, though still recommended."
4,Here We Go Again,"First off, I wasn't a big fan of The Hand Of Thrawn duology or Survivor's Quest. I was fully prepared to hate this book (or at least gain some more ammo in my kill-Thrawn-dead crusade). But I decided to give Tim Zahn another chance. He deserved it for helping to revitalize the Star Wars expanded universe in 1991.I'm glad I did.I'm no richer than most people, and don't have a lot of extra money to toss away on a questionable Hard Cover. But I enjoyed this book ... for the most part. Obi-wan and Anakin were included in an ultimately unimportant adventure. The first 1/3 of the book seemed to focus on everything EXCEPT Outbound Flight.Having said that, it is a good novel. The man writes with style, and I actually caught myself reading it until the wee hours... something I haven't done with a Zahn book since The Last Command. I'll buy his next book."
1,"Dreadful 1-dimensional characters, no point","Outbound Flight has a facinating premise, a Jedi expedition to discover strange new worlds, seek out new life and new civilizations etc, etc. But never delivers.Instead the story disolves into a predictable confilict between a 1-dimensional fallen Jedi and a Mary Sue-like invicible alien. Logic and drama are cast aside for an utterly predictable climax with most of the cast quietly killed off-camera."
4,An Entertainingly Good Read,"I have read a number of Timothy Zahn novels, and this is one of his better ones (not the best, but very good). I enjoyed reading about the roots of Admiral Thrawn, what his people are like, their rules of engagement, and cultural idiosyncrasies. And I really enjoyed reading about Jorus C'Boath (the ""real"" one!) and how just belligerent and turgid he was, bullying his way around everywhere, telling people what to do and how to do it. You'll just love to hate him.In typical Zahn fashion, there is much detail and character development. Finally, though I read this book prior to reading the ""Hand of Thrawn"" duology (which is actually chronologically correct), Zahn was very careful to dovetail many, if not all, the details presented in his earlier works with this prequel.All in all, it was quite enjoyable to read."
3,So So,"This book did not impress me in the least. I could be wrong, but it goes against the books that were written later in the series. I had a completely different opinion of Outbound Flight before reading this book, and quite frankly, I liked that opinion much better.I read it because it is Star Wars, and I would recommend it to someone else, but I think that if you have an opinion of Outbound Flight already, and like it, don't read this book. Or at the very least, don't take it to heart."
4,Another good effort from Zahn,"I'm not usually a fan of these franchised series books but there are some authors who consistently produce good stories despite the limitations of the form, and Timothy Zahn is one of them. We return once again in Outbound Flight to Thrawn, one of those villains who you can't help but admire (much like Maris, one of the characters in this novel). These are the early days, however, when he was still ""just"" a commander in the Chiss fleet.Wisely, Obi-Wan and Anakin are secondary characters in the story, Zahn focusing on Thrawn and the events that lead up to his joining the Emperor.It's good space opera, good Star Wars, and good Zahn. So, if you like any or all of those three categories, you'll enjoy this book."
2,Star War Novel,A novel which takes place when Anakin Skywalker is a teenager. An easy read but content is only fair as compared to other novels and series in the star wars environment. It does provide an introduction to Thrawn for future adventures in the galaxy
2,"This felt ""forced"" And that IS a Jedi pun.","I really enjoyed the ""Hand of Thrawn"" series by Timothy Zahn. I was raised on the Star Wars movies but before Zahn I had never read any quality Star Wars based fiction. That being said, this is the worst book by Zahn that I have read. The story arc is flat, the characters are caricatures of the already repetitive Zahn stock models of: Jedi, Smuggler, Military Genius, Devious Political Agent, etc. This is not worth reading unless you are a Zahn fanatic and need to get your next fix; if that applies to you then I suggest you get help."
4,Reprint of a classic natural history of freshwater mussels,"Not even sure that the printers know what they are printing, but this is a scan of the original Ortmann book. Very handy to be able to purchase at a reasonable price. At least in my copy some pages are not well copied and are hard to read. Most of it is great."
3,Not much going on,"A lot quality training coupled with a lot of menial tasks. Boredom, cigarettes, liquor and brothels. Not my kind of life, thank you! Why don't they devise some ways to keep the troops busy in an intelligent, constructive fashion? Why not offer courses on different subjects; promote sport events,language and work skills? Why not teach them manners and how to behave like gentlemen and scholars? Why not offer a variety of recreational activities as an alternative to brothel hopping and heavy drinking/smoking? Why not foster the men's spirituality through chaplains of various denominations? Why cannot one be a spiritual person and a warrior at the same time? Why not offer meditation classes, martial arts, Zen sessions? I enjoyed the book; it read well and it was comical at times, but it surely did not make me want to join the Legion."
2,More BS but slightly entertaining,"I read this book when it came out many years ago and I have to say that while slightly entertaining I felt that the author was a BS artist.I never served in the FFL, but I have served 15 years in the USMC and the USA and I cannot tolerate whiners and complainers.I felt that Jennings is a quitter because he broke his contract with the Legion by deserting his comrades.No branch of the military ever promises you a rose garden especially the Legion."
3,More escapade that story,"Some poor English guy is down on his luck and decides to join the French Foreign Legion. This is his tale of woe as he quickly discovers that it is not all that he thought it was. He goes on to describe a life of sex, strange rules, violence, barracks humor, sex, North African life, sex, violence...you get the idea.At times the author is unintentionally funny but most of the events seem, shall we say, a little off the wall. What the author attempts to do (and fails) is draw the distinction between the reality of the Legion and its outside perception. The reason I say ""fails"" is because, despite the many and sundry descriptions of wild, cruel or inhumane behavior, the author seems to have joined in and liked it. There is an air of admiration about some of the sickest/worse scenes presented."
3,pretty entertaining,"filled with funny war stories, probably full of exaggerations and embellishments like most military memoirs written by disillusioned ex-service members, regardless of what you think of the author, its a pretty solidly written book"
5,Entertaining and Interesting Account,"I enjoyed the book. I have read some of the other books mentioned in reviews including the history of the Legion by Douglas Porch. I gave this book to a friend who gave it back to me without finishing it because he thought Jennings was a ""punk"". I understand my friend's point but I enjoyed Jennings' experiences nevertheless. I have always been interested in the Legion and I sometimes wished I could join for a week or two every year to toughen up a bit. But I do not think I would want to be a part of it for an extended length of time. I am now 68 years old and I was in the US Army for six years but the treatment there was nowhere near the grueling life experienced by the Legion, at least not where I was. But I really enjoyed Christian Jennings' cautionary tale about his life in the Legion. Jennings is no hero, to be sure, but his account is interesting and entertaining but not for the gung-ho veteran."
1,Chris Jennings,"I went through basic with Chris Jennings ,his tale is full of inaccuracies about the people he did basic training with , there was no South African , people he said deserted did not , his own achievements are highly over exaggerated and so on ,although his account of treatment of recruits was fairly accurate , basic was done in Orange which was very unusual and I think the 1er Rec were determined to turn the recruits out better than Castel...at any cost.Back to Jennings book .....save your money ,""Marching With The Devil"" by David Mason is more accurate."
1,Bottom of the heap...,"If I could rate this book as no stars out of five I would... I didn't plan on reading an account of the legion by a deserter, yet I happened to find this book in a second hand store at a cheap price so why not. Essentially the book starts out on a good note and is quite an enjoyable read, life is tough for Jennings... but hey! This is the French Foreign Legion... One would be naive to expect otherwise! However, when Jennings decides to desert little is actually clear as to why and things really don't appear all that bad for the author and ultimately the rest of the book is a complete let down and paints quite a poor picture of the author. This is quite honestly the worst book I have ever read on the legion and does not paint a negative picture of the legion or its methods... rather it paints, as I've said before, a very poor picture of the author himself."
5,Son loved it!,This was a gift for my son. He loved it! He told me I definitely need to watch it!Very moving and motivational!Highly recommended!!!
5,"The Victor Marx story DVD, When Impossible Is the Only Way Out!","The transparency of Victor Marx in his own true life story of abuse, pain and suffering in his childhood is totally life changing and reveals the true redemptive power of God's forgiveness in a broken, shattered life, and heart, when one turns to God and believes in the power of His love and grace. I consider this documentary to be a five star movie. Everyone should see this dramatic, true story."
5,Blessed & inspired!,"The story of Victor Marx reflects God's mercy, grace, love, and faithfulness in the face of impossible circumstances. Having reconnected with Victor/his ministry after meeting in the 1980's has been nothing short of a blessing. God has truly changed the impossible to possible and is using this Man of God in countless ways to reach out to the lost and hurting. I highly recommend the book and the film to anyone who needs to know how much God loves them and what He can do in the midst of the worst circumstances. May the Lord's blessing continue to be upon this ministry for many years to come!"
5,One DVD I will be passing along,"Watched this last night and was so thankful and grateful that there is someone out there looking after kids that have acted out in anger and hurt. Victor's story gives hope to those that have been mistreated and abused. After watching the DVD I immediately thought of 2 people I want to share this DVD with. Watch it, be inspired to pray for those kids and ATP ministries. Share the DVD with people you know that need hope and forgiveness. This story is an honest, straight forward telling of Victor's abuse and how he turned a horrible life into one that inspires and brings hope to those that have been or are in similar situations of abuse and mistreatment."
5,Awesome!,"Gripping and humbling story! What a great testimony - a must see for all. Enjoyed the extras on the DVD...interviews, demos...very entertaining martial arts!"
5,The Victor Marx Story DVD,"This video will encourage any individual who struggles with believing that there is no hope in their own life. This is truly an amazing ""Never Give Up"" story."
5,Great Movie,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in years. I can't say enough good about it. If you type Victor Marx into Youtube, you will also see some amazing stuff he does."
5,The Victor Marx Story,"Although I have not experienced or endured what Victor has, it was easy to relate to. Couldn't put it down until I was finished."
5,Best Documentary Ever Made!!!,"I can't find words to express my feelings about it. Powerful, Encouraging, God's Grace and Faithfulness,Forgiveness... It's the best Documentary I ever seen! Emotionally, I'm not very emotional about stuff. Your movie has pierced my heart full of Joy and encouraged me to walk much deeper with Jesus! Thank You for making this film. It will definitely change people's lives for the better."
5,Powerful,"Wonderful movie on the power of forgiveness. Watched the movie with the whole family, lots of questions from the kids, it was a great opportunity to share thoughts and discuss the issue. What an amazing journey he and his family have gone through, so wonderful they are sharing there story so others can be healed as well. This is a must see movie."
5,You will love the first scene!,Touching testimony of a real man that went through real hard life tramas and encountered the one and only real God! Changed his life. Saved him. Healed his wounds.You will be so moved at the transparency of Victor Marx. Eileen is not bad either! Bravo! Great Job Trey! Kim and Dennis Rasche
4,"Summer song, 2001!!!","Forget ""Get your Freak On"", THIS was the summer song of 2001.....just not in the US :-( I heard it when I was on vacation back home in England. Its just going to be going round in your head all day, every day, non-stop, over and over. There's a beautiful piano bit at the start that I love, and the chorus is just ridiculously hooky and bound to become your current catchphrase (We're lovin' it lovin' it lovin' it). It's held together with a garage MC rap which I think stretches on too long, after all, this song is JUST about the chorus!"
4,King is always King,"I recently purchased King of Queens, adding to the series. If your a fan, GET IT! Most last seasons aren't very good and it's not great. The only real complaint I had was there were no extras being that it was the last season. I was hoping for some sort of look back type of thing or something that talked to the cast. Besides that, it's the last season and being a fan I HAD TO BUY IT. If your a fan, GET IT!"
5,Best comedy ever,"This is definitely the best season yet! My favorite episode was when Doug was showing Carrie how to act like a hot stripper. He jumped on the pole and kept saying you need to be one with the pole. Awesome season, can't wait for season 9 to come out on DVD."
2,They've gotten nasty and hateful. This is comedy?,"This started out as a funny, good natured comedy with Doug and Cary a sometimes quarrelsome but ultimately loving couple, a la The Honeymooners.Somewhere in the middle of the run, they started turning nasty and hateful towards each other, with hardly a hint of the affection that made it funny in the beginning. I'm sorry, but I don't particularly care to watch two people yell and scream at each other for a half hour.And did they really think they were being ""cutting edge"" by having the character spout the word ""frigging"" or ""frickin"" ten times an episode? How sophomoric can you get? Makes me realize how really great Frasier was!This one jumped the shark back in the third of fourth episode and I made it this far only because I made the mistake of buying the Complete Series and hated to waste my money. But I've decided I'd rather waste my money than my time."
5,king of queens,"i have the entire collection of king of queens episodes, i love all of them even seeing them a second or third time they still make you laugh your head off."
5,AS GOOD AS EVER,"This series never fails to be top notch comedy.There are no weak episodes although there is not so much Arthur this time,maybe because he""s getting on a bit!Disappointing lack of extras but still very good value.I live in England but postage only took a week from USA (if you are from outside USA you need to remember it""s region 1)Cant wait for new and last series to be released,just a shame it will be the last."
4,Valuable as a history of exploration,"Burger and Salazar produced Machu Picchu: Unveiling the Mysteries of the Incas as a companion piece to a museum exhibit. It contains some valuable history of the Bingham's early hypothesis formation, original photos of the site before it was fully cleared, and a catalog of the pieces brought back to Yale by the early explorers. The text targets people already very familiar with the story Machu Picchu, so it shouldn't be treated as a coffee table book. If you need a set of impressive pictures and easily interrupted text on current hypotheses about Machu Micchu, you have many other choices.This book belongs in an academic library, or the history section of a public library that already has a book on Machu Picchu that caters to the casual reader."
4,Huh?,"This toy is a lot of fun I turn it on at night and leave it on it is so much fun. But a problem I had with it was i used it so much that the light went out. I still cant figure out how to replace the lightbulb. Another problem i had was the cd's got really hot. Another problem I had was when the lava got really cold and i accendently knocked it over the ""lava"" broke apart and it took forever to get it back together but other than those problems it was really cool. I am 12 years old and I got this when I was 10. It was the bomb Holla!"
5,Great clippers!,"My friend is a professional dog groomer and she recommended this model. I have 3 Cocker Spaniels, one of them has a really thick curly hair. Working with these clippers was like cutting through butter. I find it funny when people complain about the blades getting hot. Of course they get hot. That's what the cooling spray is for. I used them for entire hour, applied cooling spray occasionally, but the body itself never got hot. Love this product, would strongly recommend!"
4,workbench,My son loves fixing things and the workbench is great. It comes with lots of tools and is very durable. My 27 lb toddler now likes to climb up on it so it is pretty strong. We have had it for 7 months and have no complaints.
4,Therese Raquin,One of Zola's early works. Not his best. I agree it should have taken the form of a short story. I found it to be repetitive towards the end myself.But as often is the case with Zola he can transport you to a time and place in the past that no longer exists and does so with tremendous descriptive style.
2,text missing,"I have read about 40% of this book so far, so there may be more problems, but so far I have found that almost all of Chapter 20 is missing from this Kindle edition."
1,IN FRENCH!,Says item is in English. But it is in French. I ordered another after communicating w/Amazon and it was still IN FRENCH. i do not speak French!I had to send both copies back for a refund.
1,Very poor translation of a masterpiece,"This is a great book by one of the greatest authors in the history of literature. But this translation is very poor and was done in the 1880s at the height of censorship. This publisher--which is amazon--downloaded a public domain translation and put a John Singer Sargent portrait of a rich American on the cover!!!The story is about an unattractive downtrodden French woman, not an heiress. This is a terrible case of marketing over substance. DO NOT ENCOURAGE creatspace to pawn off cheap inaccurate editions on the unknowing public."
3,"My quibble is not with the writing, but with the narration","I enjoyed listening to this audio version of Thérèse Raquin, except for one aspect of the narration that I found very distracting. I wish someone had coached the narrator, Tracy Svensgaard, on French pronunciation, particularly for the titular heroine's first name. Svensgaard kept saying it as ""terr-ESS."" It should be pronounced ""tay-RHEZ,"" (with the ""rh"" representing a French ""R""). Svensgaard also pronounces ""monsieur"" as ""mawn-shyeuh""!"
2,"No, no, no!","I have to disagree with you people that think that this book is soooo excelent. Ok, it is the begining of a new era that Zola creates but I mean, if almost 80 pages goes to just describe the same thing over and over again then...ZzZzZz. He is very skilled in his naturalistic way of describing it all but this novel would have been so much better if it would have been a short story. Unfortunately the short story does not get almost any attention in the litterary world so Zola did not have much of a choice. It is a novel that should not escape any readers attention because it is one of the novels that every man should know about. Pardon my spelling but that has never been my good side."
3,"interesting, not exciting","Interesting character development, not a lot of action. It seemed the author wanted to creat a ""feeling"" rather than explain a lot. Also, I was hoping for more of a tie-in w/ Cyteen. It never was clear to me just what Ari (the main character in Cyteen)had programmed into the colonists and how it would help humanity. It seemed more like several short stories that covered important periods of a colony than anything else."
4,"Enjoyable read, so-so recipes","I feel kind of nostalgic about Laurel's Kitchen because an earlier edition was part of my introduction to meatless cooking in our co-op kitchen back in college. At one time, this book and a handful of others were the only vegetarian cookbooks ""out there."" I forgot about it for many years, then it came to my attention again and I purchased this updated edition.There are so many other great vegetarian cookbooks out now that these seem slightly uninspired by comparison. I have made several of the recipes, and despite following them to the letter, each and every one seemed kind of bland. I had forgotten about that factor, or I guess I didn't mind it at the time. I have zippier versions of many of the recipes in other cookbooks, but for some people, the blandness and simplicity could be a plus. I think this is a good basic handbook for someone new to vegetarian cooking who is not looking for anything spicy or exotic. The book is enjoyable and informational to read."
5,"An old, well loved standby","In my eight years of vegetarianism, I find myself turning back to Laurel's Kitchen again and again. It never ceases to amaze me how the deceptively simple recipes create delicious food, time and time again. I suspect that the reviewer who complained of ""lackluster recipes"" just skimmed through, without bothering to prepare any of them. The strength of this book lies in its minimalist recipes, letting the quality of the ingredients shine through. In this respect Laurel's Kitchen is a welcome relief from the many vegetarian cookbooks which rely extensively on fancy techniques, ingredients, or equipment which you may not have at your fingertips. Not that I'm opposed to gourmet vegetarian cooking; but for day to day, simple, hearty food, I refer to Laurel's Kitchen before anything else in my cookbook library.Bonus material includes guidelines for new vegetarians, wider implications of a vegetarian diet, and a slew of handy nutritional charts."
1,Narrow minded prose with lackluster recipes,"I am, for lack of a better explanation, an omnivore in a caring relationship with a vegetarian. Since I do most of the cooking, I often search through vegetarian cookbooks for ideas and recipes for us or just to make for her. In truth, this book deeply insulted me. The author's repeated attacks on those of us who eat meat were offensive to me personally and I would think to anyone with an open minded view of the world. If you happen to be a militant vegan, this book may just be your style. As for the rest of the general populace, the recipes were pedestrian and the viewpoints were unwelcome."
2,Political polemic with time wasting recipes,"The original book was an anti-technology diatribe. The authors waste time creating a strawman ""nutrition establishment"" with whom to argue while the reality is that the American Dietetic Association has long been aware that a good vegetarian diet is possible.Definitely a book by and for upper middle class women who needn't work - to one such as myself it sounds like the bizarre rantings of a species from a different planet.I use the book for ideas, but I modify the recipes using classic cookery tricks and machinery to speed and ease the process after a 10 hour workday."
2,fat-o-phobia,"Because I am not a fat-o-phobe, I bought the book to be inspired by healthy and delicious grains, vegetables, and fruit. I was disappointed. In my opinion, based on trying many, there were a few recipes that were OK, perhaps a dozen or so in the entire book. In any case, most data from epidemiological studies does not clearly support the low-fat craze, although I'm not recommending someone eat 2 lbs. of butter or oil with every meal. At least for my taste, the Moosewood or Enchanted Broccoli Forest was a richer source of inspiration and flavor."
5,very food low fat cook book,Laurels kitchena very good low fat cook book for people who ahve to be on a low fat diet
2,Textbook Definition,"It's a textbook and I was looking for something more. I guess I was hoping to find not just different definitions of the types of communication, but strategies for improving them. When the book introduces itself as looking at communication through teams or groups, I expected more analysis on group dynamics and the different patterns of communications within working teams. It didn't. I was looking for something that this book doesn't offer."
2,Not much content,"The other two reviewers must have received a different book. The book has one diagram with any dimensions. There are no recommended bearings, axles, headset, or materials. There are no references to the use of modern bicycle components, although my copy was updated in 2005. There is minimal design guidance.There are lots of high level, exploded components diagrams and some B&W; photos of unicycles and ""artistic"" bicycles. If you are ready to build a unicycle after reading the book, you were ready before reading it.If you want the type of material which should have been in this book, buy ""Atomic Zombie's Bicycle Builder's Bonanza"". (For reference, I am a graduate of the two-week Barnett Bicycle Institute bicycle maintenance class and a pretty decent mechanic.)"
2,Not as great as you might think .. .. ..,"I bought this great clock for my daughter's birthday. To my disappointment, once you turn off the radio the clock shuts off too. There is no AC adapter, so your three AAA batteries die quickly and the clock will need to be reset anyway. It is more trouble than it is worth.Not a good buy!"
2,"Good idea, bad product","I bought this clock for my 9-year old. The sound quality is so poor that it's difficult to understand both my son's self-recorded wake up message, and the clocks pre-recorded time announcement. The volume is so loud we put the clock in a drawer when our baby is napping (in another room). Additionally, the clock is supposed to announce the time if you clap. However, it announces the time in response to all sorts of noises, such as ""THREE EIGHTEEN AM"" when my son rolls over in bed. High points for durability because I've ""accidently"" knocked it off the dresser, top bunk etc. several times and it keeps ticking. Skip it."
1,Momof five,"Santa brought my 2 boys these for Christmas. I have to say I am disappointed with it's preformance. You can not understand the time announcment. It's very crackly. The radio part is Okay. The but as another reviewer said the clock only lights up with noise. and then it will announce the time in that horrid crackly sound you can not understand.It is a great idea and my hat is off to the child that invented it, but It could have been manufactured much better."
1,DON'T BUY!!!,"Unless you plan on having 5 AA batteries on hand at all time, this is not for you. It doesn't run on AC, so if the batteries die and you don't have any on hand, your child doesn't have an alarm clock. You can't tell what time it is at night because the time only lights up when the clock annouces the time, which is whenever there is any sort of noise in the house, and then you can't understand it because it is so loud. There is no volumn switch. Stay away from Room Gear items until they get all the bugs out."
2,returning ITEM,This is a piece of JUNK.......the radio is the only good feature.......The voice sounds as if he is talking with a mouth full of marbles and you really cannot understand the time it is very sensitive you don't have to clap several sounds activate the so called message that needs a Speech Therapist ***I agree DO NOT BUY Until they get the bugs OUT.
2,Annoying,"The premise is good...letting kids wake to their own voice, clapping to get the time, etc. However, this clock can't pull it off. First of all, the voice that states the time is very loud and the recording is not clear. There is no way to change the volume of the voice. Second, the voice goes off with the sound of any movement, not just clapping. So, throughout the night, you hear this annoying voice stating the time.This clock does teach the basics of using an alarm clock, which was great for my daughter (age 8). However, I plan to return it to get a clock that is less annoying."
1,Disappointing clock,"This clock seemed like a fun idea, but it doesn't work as promised. Instead of saying the time when hands are clapped, it does so when anyone breathes around the clock. My son couldn't sleep.Sorry. Nice try."
2,For beginners only,"I bought this book hoping to get some new ideas for nail art. Instead I found a book that relies heavily on ready-made nail decals and simple painted lines for its designs. If you are completely and utterly new to nail art, then this book will give you some simple ideas. If you have some experience - then you too will be very disappointed."
2,A Poor Representation of Powell's Genius,"Bud Powell is one of my absolute favorites and I have practically everything that the man recorded, but this is not one of his best. The playing is limp and completely lacking either sparkle or Powell's usual nervous energy. I would hate for someone unfamiliar with Powell to buy this CD to try him out and be disappointed thinking this is what all the fuss is about. The other of Powell's RCA recordings (Swingin' with Bud) is far superior, if still not in the first rank of Powell performances. For those, you need to go to the first two volumes of ""The Amazing Bud Powell"", or some of his Verve recordings. This one is just for the competists (like myself) out there."
3,Average,"There are two distinct phases of Powell's career. The first, in which he was the greatest who ever touched a piano, blazing with intensity, beauty and inventiveness. The second, after increasing mental and health problems had diminished his skills, and after the development of a pared down, simpler sound (slower tempos, more block chords). This session, one of the two recorded in the late 50s for RCA (the other is ""Swingin With Bud"") is squarely in the latter and not a good one at that. It is similar to the bad Verve sessions from the 50s. I agree, it is not representative of the best of Bud. However, for those who wish to complete a collection, this set does contain some pleasant moments, if not much brilliance."
4,classic hiroshima,"If you like smooth jazz with an interesting twist, you will love this CD. The Japanese instruments and vocals by June are the wonderful combination. This CD is a great introduction to Hiroshima and is perfect to listen to even though it was cut almost two decades ago."
3,"1985 album, wrong date on item description","I thought I remembered buying this ages ago but the item description has the date 2009 - possibly because it's now printed on demand. If you're shopping for new Hiroshima music, don't be fooled."
4,Very pleased,"I was very pleased with my cd, it was in great condition, got it in only a few days please customer!"
5,HIROSHIMAS BEST,"I own this album, as well as the 1st 3 albums by Hiroshima.I think that they are one of the finest jazz groups that I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. While it is possible that maybe a couple of Cd's they have released could be interpreted as a little uneven, I think that overall they have displayed a great deal of consistency over the last 30 + years.This CD is their crowning achievement I think.Also the 1st(self-titled) CD and East are among the finest work that the jazz fusion genre has produced. A SUPER GROUP"
3,Patrick,"I purchased this DVD, as well as the first one (Consistent Tennis I). If you already own the first one, DON'T buy this one since it contains almost the same info. This one has a few more details, it isn't worth the money to buy both. I'd by the first one over this. Also Avery has an annoying guitar solo at the beginning which seems totally inappropriate. It's like those actors who try to sing..."
5,A good read,"An engrossing, fascinating and erotic book that portrays complex relationships as the high-powered lesbians of this story get to know one another and themselves. Good writing. Sexy characters! Really captures the Hamptons ""scene,"" as well as that of the tempestuous New York art world. Go read it!"
1,Not the same Polycom in your office . . .,"This product is no where close to the quality that I expected from the Sound Stations in my office. First, the highest level speaker volume is way too low (I have had better volume from phone line powered speakerphones). Second, the speed dial design is terrible (see other reviews, but my reasons include that you can only store an 8 character description for each number and dialing any stored number is a 3 step process). For the price, the Panasonic TMC98 is a better choice."
3,Not worth the money,"I've used Polycom pod phones at work for years and think they're great. This phone, though, is a disappointment. I'll echo what the others say about speakerphone quality. OK, but I've heard cheaper phones give quality nearly as good. It has no backlit display which is a crime in a phone this expensive. The biggest annoyance is that the incoming volume is just not loud enough. People will call in and I'll have the volume on 5... and not be able to hear them. Note: My phone is over a year old, maybe they've improved it since then (I hope so)."
1,"Over-Priced, Features Don't Match Polycom Name","I bought this phone because of the great quality of the Polycom office speakerphones. What a disappointment it has proven to be:- Speakerphone functions are poor. Incoming sound is very good, but the mic picks up less well than $40 Panasonic speakerphones. - Odd controls are difficult to get used to - switching between calls is awkward, and you'll lose or mistakenly conference calls until you figure out control sequence that are simpler on other phone brands. - LCD display is one of the worst thought out I've ever seen. Incoming and outgoing numbers are shown for a few seconds, then the display shows ""SoundPoint Pro"" instead. Polycom sacrificed function here to show its brand, even though the brand is written all over the phone anyway! - Cabling is unnecessarily complex and ugly.It would be bad enough if the phone were competitively priced, but there is no reason to pay the Polycom premium for this product."
1,Poor Support,The speaker phone is clear but the maximum volume is too low.Our phone stopped working after 13 months. Polycom offered to sell us a rebuilt one for the same price as a new one. Such a deal.Obviously we are not happy.
2,Great speakerphone but fails on other features!,"I bought the SoundPoint wih high hopes, but ended up having to send it back because the ring from line 2 ""bled"" into line 1. Pros: Great speakerphone - kind of bassy. CID/CWID is good - but cannot edit/delete some or all calls. Setup/programming is OK. Cons: No message-waiting light, so have to pickup headset to see if you have any phone company messages. Two-line display - can't show all info about call-waiting at once (e.g. name, #, date, time). Accessing CID messages and directory is by scrolling - not very convenient. ""Ring"" is too soft to hear sometimes."
1,Just Stopped Working One Day,"Suddenly, after 16 months of use, the phone just stopped working. Neither the handset nor the speaker phone works and the LCD display has gone blank (but the LEDs light-up). I called the customer support line and they recognized the problem. But they will not replace or fix the phone without charging me ... since the one-year warranty period ran out four months ago. Obviously I am not going to pay ... for a refurbised phone, especially since I was never really happy with it. Its duplex feature never quite worked well and the mic was not sensitive enough and the speaker volume never went high enough. Overall, the quality of Polycom's home products are drastically inferior to its office products."
2,Keep your expectations low...,"I enjoyed the Polycom speaker phone for about 1 year. The unit looked good, and the speakerphone was decent - but not 'awe inspiring' by any stretch. It certainly doesn't measure up to the conference phones I use at work, also from Polycom (why I decided on that brand in the first place).So - after spending 200+, I ended up with a phone that lasted a year. It no longer disconnects the phone line, and I have to pull the phone jack in order for the phone to disconnect.For what it's worth, I will just spend $40 to replace it & get the same features. If it lasts a year, that's okay."
1,Stopped working after one day,The sound quality of the speaker was fantastic. But when I started using it on calls everybody agreed that my voice sounded tinny and wanted me to pick up the receiver. It's pretty embarrassing when you tell clients that you're using a state-of-the art speaker phone and they tell you to pick up the receiver because you're hard to understand. After one day the microphone stopped working altogether. This is not what I was expecting from the Polycom name. Don't bother buying this phone.
4,"Good book, a bit wordy.","This book has a lot of tips about SQL Server, although it doesn't say that on the cover. This was actually good for me since I was going on a job interview and I needed something like a comprehensive tips reference book on SQL (and SQL Server). I could have easily chosen a worse book. It's a bit wordy for me, and I'm not used to seeing so many typos, but considering that I have seen some terrible SQL books out there (including my college text), this book is actually well thought out."
4,Basketball Legends: Michael Jordan,"Basketball Legends :Michael Jordan is an excellent book written by Sean Dolan. No one in the history of basketball has ever owned as many ways to score a hoop as M.J. can. But he wasn't into basketball his whole life. His first passion was baseball while he was growing up in Wilmington, North Carolina. I like this book because on most of the pages it has a picture with some information. Also at the end of the story it has an index and some other interesting facts on Michael. These elements of the book provide convenient summaries. So if you like Michael Jordan and would like to learn more, read this book."
4,Vocal interpretations of classic Villa Lobos pieces,"Maria Lucia Godoy""Interpreta Villa Lobos""(Philips, 1977)-------------------------------------------Brazilian soprano Maria Lucia Godoy sings operatic vocal interpretations of classic Heitor Villa Lobos compositions, with backing by a subdued chamber ensemble. This also features acoustic accompaniment by guitarist Sergio Abreu, who worked with Godoy on related Villa-Lobos projects. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Brazilian Music)"
4,Funny! A mom in need of a laugh? Get this book!,"Are you a mom with young kids? Maybe you have a toddler and are pregnant again? You will be nodding your head, saying, uh-huh, laughing, totally identifying with this mom. Probably saying, ""Hey, I could have written this!"" I'm enjoying this book and as a mom to two young ones, a 3 yr old, and an 11 month old, I recommend it. (I read it in the bathroom or while nursing!)"
2,Light light reading,The readings in this book are light readings. I downloaded it because I thought it would give me brief readings that would not take too much time. This is does.But the light readings are at a fairly low reader level and I found myself bored with the style. My expectation was a short story format that all ages could enjoy. My disappointment is that it is not for all ages - it's for pre-adult ages.
5,Not Like Grimm At All!,"Being of Welsh descent and wanting to share my heritage with my children, I chose this title. I did not regret it. The Welsh culture is rich in magic, lore, and interesting descriptions of the world. This collection brings together a decent spectrum of stories that you can share with your kids and still get a chuckle out of as an adult. I loved it. - Dr. G."
4,A lovely collection of tales.,"I found this to be very enjoyable reading. I learned a bit about Welsh culture, and enjoyed some stories I had never before read or heard. Not too childish for the adult reader, but not so lofty as to be beyond children.A good read to share with your child(ren)."
1,Universal Hard Fast Banana,"This is for GAINING weight , so make sure you dont misread or misunderstand what this product says, its not for losing weight."
3,Undecided,I ordered this and was surprised how much I got for the price! That part was a great deal. As far as it working I haven't notice any difference yet. I am going to continue to use it because I may not haven't given it enough time yet. I have 2 cats and 1 dog so fleas are always a problem and I hate using chemicals on them and prefer something natural if possible. I have heard positive remarks about garlic and brewers yeast so like I said I will give this a few weeks more and then do a follow up review..
2,What is the point?,"This book treats mechanics of materials from a pedogogy that is thirty years old. Withthe advent of computer methods no one uses these solutions. Also, the approch is so rudementary that it limits one from reading any current treatment of the subject. Say something about stress functions, or more on inelasticity. If you want a refernce get Roarks if you want to learn something useful get Shames and Cozzarelli's book"
3,Delightful travel accounts from Joan Grant,"I can see a reader being disappointed by this book, as there is really almost nothing ""supernatural"" about it! The fact is, Joan only wrote this for her publisher in order to finance a trip to the Lotoise region of France in the 1950's, where she had traveled many times throughout the 20th century. Having said that, I thoroughly enjoy her writing. She has a chapter about the children of the region, for example, which is wonderful. I love travel books in general, and so, even though this book is fairly useless for contemporary Lotoise travel, having been written 60 years ago, it is really fascinating for me, an American, to read about the history and culture of that time. There were some gems in it for sure."
3,Unsure,I bought this along with a Beckett pump and was unimpressed by the loose and/or ill-fitting accessories. A case for brick and mortar.
3,"Nice, but...","Too darn small! Spend the extra money and buy the next size up. Tried to cook a turkey breast, and it just barely fit under the lid. Not a lot of room if you plan on using a roasting rack. No room, if you want to do a smoker box. With just the two burners, it can be a challenge to control heat for large items, if you are using indirect cooking. Still, it is an excellent grill. Easy to assemble and does an excellent job on the easy stuff. Excellent for burgers and brats, but I would go up to the next size, for anything more exotic."
4,Great grill for its size,"I really like this grill. Like others have said, it is a little small, but for me (and most of the people I grill with), it's plenty big. I like the independantly controllable burners, and like the fact that they are parrallel side to side rather than front to back, so that you get a very wide area for indirect grilling (e.g. for ribs). Weber customer service is also top-notch. I had some problems with the grates cracking(!), and they immediately sent me new grates via Fed-Ex. I would definitely recommend this grill for the casual griller."
5,A MUST READ STORY of triumph over Alzheimer's,"A ""must read"" for ever person whose life is touched by the ""nightmare"" of Alzheimer's. This is an incredible book that is written from the heart of a man whose wife, and family have suffered with this dreaded disease for over decade. As the author's oldest grandson I have seen the toll that this has taken on all those closest and most dear. This book is a tribute to the struggles, pain and triumph that one family has endured and the victory that has been known through faith in our Creator."
3,"Good Music, Poor Sound","First I liked the music and particularly I like the use of the sax in this surf album. I don't like the sound or tone of their guitars. I have actually found this cd irritating to listen to because the tone of the instruments is irritating. If they got rid of the high treble tank sound I thing they would be great. Yes, it almost sounds like they are playing under water and that is OK for one or two numbers but not for the whole album."
3,okay but lost interest fast,my bright 8 yr old was very excited and was able to put the flying saucer project together by himself. He did the two other projects also. he then quickly lost interest. he wanted the bigger package where he could do much more projects. i should have bought him the sc-300 or at least the sc-100 package because that includes the flying saucer also and many more projects. this pkg does not get you the biggest bang for the buck.
1,Not durable.,"I purchased this for my 4 year old son who has made basic circuits on the Snap Circuits Jr. The helicopter disk on the Snap Circuits Jr set had been well used by my older son, so all I really needed was the replacement. What was in this package was a flimsy disk that didn't even fit on the motor. It was a disappointment since the Snap Circuits Jr kid was so durable and well made. I was expecting the same quality but this Snap Circuits Flying Saucer was obviously made in a different factory with different quality control standards."
4,Flying Saucer,"We had gotten this for a friend of the family. When he opened it up, he wasn't sure what to think of it. When my son showed him how it worked and what to do, he played with it nonstop. They thought it was pretty cool when the saucer hit the ceiling (about 8ft) each time it flew off. My son now wants one."
4,Good,Goes with the larger set. I would not buy this alone. The larger set is a lot of fun. You will need to work with your younger children in order for snap circuits to work. Great gift though!
4,scientific learning tool,This is a good scientific learning tool...it's a 'hands-on' project paralleling what 4th graders are learning in school and it's fun!
3,Laurel & Hardy are the whole show in this hour of fun.,"Most of Laurel & Hardy's later films had confining scripts that didn't give the team much room to do their stuff. ""The Bullfighters"" is a happy exception, with funny gags and familiar pantomime. Stan Laurel co-wrote and co-directed without screen credit, so fans are taking a second look (or even a first look) at this forgotten comedy. The boys' precision timing is as sharp as ever, and they're in practically every scene. The video transfer is excellent."
3,L&H last American film is very funny,"While the script is nothing to write home about, this is actually one of the best (if not THE best) of Laurel and Hardy's post-Hal Roach films. Stan and Babe contribute lots of funny bits of business, some new and some revived from earlier Laurel and Hardy films (a taxicab gag early in the movie derives from the closing gag of Stan's 1925 solo film A MANDARIN MIXUP!). Also, research has revealed that Stan directed parts of the movie without taking credit, as he essentially did on the Roach films. Richard Lane has the key supporting role in this movie and makes an excellent foil for Laurel and Hardy. There are also brief but nice moments from Carol Andrews, William Gargan and Hank Worden. In the final analysis, THE BULLFIGHTERS may not rank with the best of vintage Laurel and Hardy, but it's still more entertaining than a lot of what passes for comedy these days. Check it out, why doncha?"
4,"Ranking: (best to...) Langoliers, Library, SunDog, and SWSG.","The Langoliers, very interesting story. Wasn't as predictable as I thought it would be. The Library Policeman was very excellent. Great characters in both of those stories. I'd recommend the Library Policeman to any younger reader, for it has gore but not as much as the others. I've only recently gotten the book, so I haven't read the Sun Dog yet, but it has to be better then then SWSG. Don't bother reading that one, it's not very interesting and has an awful ending."
3,The good & the bad,"This is a good read. No doubt about it that King is one of the greatest writers of his genre.The first two stories ""THE LANGOLIERS"" and ""SECRET WINDOW, SECRET GARDEN"" are great stories. However, ""The Sun Dog"" seems a bit sloppy in the story plot. King didn't even bother to craft it more delicately. He seemed just tried to make it to the print."
4,Langoliers was the BEST!,"Even though I am a hugh fan of Stephen King's bigger novels (It, The Stand) I found 4 Past Midnight very interesting. The best story in the book was the Langoliers, and I think that King could have expanded on that story and created a novel out of it. The Library Policeman and the Sun Dog were both very good, even though The Sun Dog was very predictable. My least fav. was Secret Window, Secret Garden, I felt it was dull."
3,The Langoliers 5 Stars-Everything Else-1,"King is one of the greatest writers of our day, and the Langoliers proves that. Without having to read one of his huge books, you can pick up the 4 Past Midnight and read the Langoliers in a day or so and not be disappointed. The rest of the short stories sort of dragged for me, but it is definitely worth it, if just for the Langoliers"
4,Great collection,Great collection! I enjoyed them very much. I would have given a fifth star except that I found something that happens in the library story unnecessary and very disturbing in a not-Stephen-King kind of way.... the violence towards a child was described in too much detail for my taste. Other stories are fantastic.
4,Four Past Midnight Review,I loved reading this book. King is an expert word Smith and has the ability to pace his stories well. These stories are all very different but all very good. You will love the careful care used in these stories. I read many of king's books and he never ceases to amaze me.
4,"If you enjoy descriptive ficton, King is the man","He is a very discriptive writer with many talents. ""The Langoliers"" and ""The Library Policeman"" were excellent. I had no problems getting involved in the story, or envisioning the characters. I have read most of his stories (excluding the fantasies) and thoroughly enjoy them.Thank God he's a devilish, twisted man. It keeps me going in this insane world :) ps: I agree..""Sun Dog"" has a cool ending."
5,Excitement entirely,A book of four short stories that will capture your imagination. Nonstop thriller will take you to the edge of your seat and back. A perfect picture of all the abilities and creativity of Stephen King.
4,Excellent Detail,"""Four Past Midnight"" by Stephen King is a story of passengers on a red-eye flight that get stuck in a previous day. The story is well written with much attention to detail on the settings and the characters. The book does have flaws in the way the characters are developed and in my opinion it was a little over written when describing certain aspects of the characters. I also thought the book was too slow and showed very little progression from page to page. Although the book had problems in some areas it truly shined in others. The way King describes the characters and the settings was fantastic. The book also showed great progression in the later part of the first story as they were trying to get back to their own time. Overall the book was extremely well written but lacked in progression in the early parts of the stories."
3,Its okay!,"The book is kinda okay. The 1st story ""The GangolierS"" is pretty amazing!! I liked the way the story kept me entertained. I was totally hooked onto the book, was trying to read it at a maddening pace :).The other 3 stories are not really that great. You might want to read them if you are out of books to read. Otherwish nuuhhh!"
1,Sleeping Past Midnight,"This book was such a disgrace. Stephen King screwed up on this one. It was too wordy, the stories too cheap. It felt like Micheal Crichton wrote some of the stories. Throw this book in the fire, it is not good. It is bad with capital letters spelling ''bad'' out."
5,All Hail The King!,"How does King do it? Four exciting stories in one chilling book. The most famous ""Langoliers"" is a great start followed by three different awesome stories. Fans of this book will love ""Skeleton Crew"" ,""Nightmares and Dreamscapes"", and ""Night Shift"". The King has made big bucks to scare the heck out of the world. Keep it up King"
5,PRETTY GOOD READ,"Stevie knows how to write, and this book proves it. RULE #1: Hook the reader and keep them engaged wanting to know what happens next.Pages should fly, NOT become a weary adventure of waiting in line for something to happen."
4,"Mr. King ""blurs the line"" and suspends disbelief so smoothly","""Chilling"" is the best description for this trip into the imagination of Stephen King and his characters. You hate 'em, you love 'em and you feel the beads of sweat on their foreheads.... This was a grimy read, and I was amazed at my discomfort and growing anxiety as the plot developed and then exploded... What a trip!!! Highly recommend it."
4,"With the lights out, I felt the need to pull my foot under the blanket","This is a great collection of novellas. Though the highlight was The Library Police. Reading it in my bed, I couldn't help but look into the darkness and wonder if I too was alone. Sure that I was, I couldn't help but slip my foot back under the covers and hide in my cotton cocoon. I know that many people have a lot of Steven King favorites but for me, this was his best story. Just like Toe Tags and Tequila by William Bryan Layton, it made the hair on my neck stand on end."
1,BEWARE - No support for Windows 7 64 bit drivers!,This was a good printer when Canon supported it. Now that we have upgraded to Windows 7 64 bit the printer is useless to us. Beware if you have a newer computer.
2,Meh,I went from soy 95 chocolate from GNC to this. Bleh. There's a wicked diet soda kind of taste. Nutrisweetish. BLEH! It came recommended by a guy from work who liked it and to him by a personal trainer who also liked it. It's got a bunch of stuff in it and whether it's good for you or not...who knows. I used different doses and different liquids (water and milk) to adjust the flavor. The guy at work uses chocolate milk.I went back to gnc soy 95 and sold the rest to the guy at work.
3,Look great! BUT...,"I bought these cherries for a display piece for a trade show, they look very realistic! Two down sides: very expensive and the unexpected yellow cherries mixed in the red cherry bags. I was able to separate out the yellow cherries into their own bags and it looked fine."
1,I wish there was a zero stars rating,These don't even fit the screen! Save your money and buy yourself a good lunch somewhere instead.
2,bad!!!!!!!!!,i got this fo christmas and i was soooooooooo happybut it is a big pain. the dolar holder sucks. it counts your money wrong and when you take money out it still says the same amout as beforedont buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
2,ATM safe bank,"This toy isn't as great as i thought I thought it would be good for putting money in as a ""SAFE"" but it fell off my dresser and broke about a week later. My recemdation is not to buy it.Regards,Joe"
3,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"'Santa' should have taken the previous bad reviews more seriously before purchasing this toy for both my kids (8 and 5). They never worked right from the beginning (coins were frequently assigned incorrect monetary amounts messing up total deposit amount, coins would feed into the incorrect area and get jammed, etc.). One was totally broken after only 2 weeks when we were unable to get coins unjammed. I watched my kids use these ATMs and it was NOT user error. I'm disappointed that Amazon would even sell this product (after shipping it back to them shortly after purchase, they have yet to refund the money I (I mean 'Santa') wasted."
2,bad toy,When you tip the safe upside down the coines fall out of it and get mixed up to gether and ive had this toy for about 1 year and my safe forgot how to subtract.
2,ICKATM : It's A Cool Kid ATM!!!,"The ATM/Safe Bank is a pretty cool toy,in-fact it's probaly the best thing I ever bought!(nice colors too!)Although I gave it only 2 stars for fun,I gave it 4 stars for educational.A kid needs to know about more of this kind of stuff.I know alot of kids in my age group that don't even know what withdrawals and account ballance means!!! I know this stuff because of comman sense and plus my mom is a teller.One reason I need this is because it keeps track of your money,and trust me thats a real good reason for me! I think other kids would like it because I know kids like places where the can keep there stuff safe."
1,Never worked,"I would have rated this toy a 0, but the system wouldn't let me. It is very hard to keep track of the money you have in the ATM. Kids have to enter the exact amount they put in or take out, it doesn't do it for them. I bought one for each of my boys. One of them stopped working after less than a week and neither of them will let you subtract if you have the wrong total entered. This was a very bad investment and I will be taking them back to the store today."
1,Way stupid,"Though it may sound weird, I own this ""toy"". I was looking for something to store money in at Toys-R-Us. This just popped out.It is horrible! If you pull hard enough,you can open the bottom drawer no problem even when the unit is turned off.The ATM cards are very breakable and easy to lose.Right after I opened the package, the coin-sorter started to malfunction. It puts dimes in nickels, pennys in quarters, and such.If you ask the machine to give you a lot of change, it will all pour out the little side door. Mine even fell of once.It counts the money wrong. If you put in alot of coins, it is determined to say you have less than you do.This thing is not a good ATM. I'd rather open a bank account and send my money there.Last Word:Children may love it, but teens don't."
2,doesnt work very well,i got this bank for my 13th birthday last year and it worked fine for about 5 or 6 months but then it started counting the money wronge and when i withdrew money it wouldnt take it out of my acount.......example:if i had $20 n there and i took $5 out it would still say that i had $20 in there instead of $5.not only the money thing but it started letting anyone in without a password.....like when u put the card in it wouldnt ask you for a password it would just take u to my account ballence......overall i think that this bank doesnt work very well and shouldnt be bought. hope this helpsAMANDA
2,Don't Buy this...,"I loved this toy at the toy store but then we came home and tried to get it working and we hated it. Don't get me wrong the IDEA of the toy is great. But the company that makes this toy should worry less about the money and getting it out on the market faster. In the long run, they'll just loose money. If I could change this toy I would make sure the coin and money withdrawn and DESPOISTS work. Instead of a card maybe their should be a combanation like for other safes. When I came online to check out the reviews I reliezed I wasn't the ONLY one wit this problem!!"
2,Not worth the money.,This bank was quite a disappointment. The card is very difficult to insert and has to be held down or else the bank shuts itself off. In general it is poorly designed and cheaply constructed.
1,NEED TO GET TO BUGS OUT!,"I purchased this toy for my 12-year-old daughter. It's a great idea, but they need to go back to the drawing board and get the bugs out. The total deposit never added up correctly, and when we tried to deduct money, (it's supposed to be able to automatically deduct coins), that didn't work properly either. Needless to say, it was a huge disappointment, and that's not mentioning the problems we had trying to get it to go on in the first place. If you're having trouble with that, push the ""ATM"" card down with great force until you feel like you are going to break the card or internal workings and then it will start with no problem :-( We were NOT happy with this toy."
2,Not worth the money!,"I bought this for my son for his birthday because he needed a bank for his money. It didn't keep accurate count of his money right from the start. We followed the directions to reset the machine, but it would NEVER register the deposits or withdrawals accurately. We were very disappointed and are in the process of returning it. It is a great idea for an advanced sort of piggy bank, but they really need to work out the kinks!"
2,Purchased two neither worked correctly,"Waste of time and money. I will be shipping back two that I bought for Christmas. It had money calculated from the beginning on both machiones that could not be zero'd out. No matter what the kids entered on the keypad, it would come up with the an incorrect total. Not enough coin space to do a whole lot of good."
2,Very unsure,"Would love to rate this product better, but to this day we still cannot get the thing to total correctly, wether depositing or withdrawing. New batteries several times, so that cannot be the problem. We have gone through customer support (roomgear.com) and yet cannot get it to work properly."
1,Great idea - disappointing product,"Just tried this for the first time with my daughter and we have now had to take the batteries out for the third time to ""reset"" it. We put in a bill and it says to enter the amount. We then put in a second bill and when you go to enter the amount, it does nothing and then the voice just becomes static. This is a great idea, but I am having no faith that I will ever get this product to work as it is supposed to work."
2,Lots of fun at first...,"The atm bank worked great for about a month. Then the total got stuck and we tried all of methods to reset from the directions. then the bill slider quit working. I even emailed the company to see what could be done. Unfornately I still have a brand new, non-working atm."
1,Please don't waste your money!,"Very disappointing. The card was really hard to use, not to mention that it did not keep accurate record of the money deposited. Take a few minutes and drive your kid to the bank with the money you will save from buying this!"
2,UNRELIABLE,This toy is a great idea. But it doesn't work good. It have been broken in first few minutes kids started to play with it. The card is not easy to insert. Very unreliable!
2,Not Skatastic,"A controversy! Well, I really love good ska. It can be old ska, new ska, bluebeat, rocksteady, whatever... as long as it's good. There are a few good songs on this (maybe more than 10%), but not a lot. Certainly not all ""gems."" By definition, everything can't be above average and you get everything with Trojan. You may find a few undiscovered nuggets if you take the time to wade through it all. I wish they'd made fewer collections with better songs, but at least they're fairly cheap..."
5,There is a little Elisha ben Abuyah in each of us,"This book is one of the best books ever written. One of my personal favorites, As a Driven Leaf, has so many deeper meanings to be found in it. This is a story about a Talmudic character Elisha ben Abuyah who leaves his great Rabbi teachers to search for the basis of God. Elisha is fixated on proving God's existance using logic. This tragedy of Elisha ends with his realization that logic must begin somewhere and that is faith. I recommend this book for everyone. Please write me if there are any questions or comments. This book can change lives."
5,Wonderful!!!,I first read this book over 25 years ago and have reread it many times since then. I have given copies of this book to several friends and all have enjoyed it as much as I have. The story and characters convey a message of faith that applies to all beliefs and a story that holds your attention at every page. There are very few books that I have read multiple times and still enjoy. This is easily one of the best books I have ever read.
4,readable but not 100% satisfying,"This book was very readable, and in many ways it brought the great sages and their era to life. (And I did not think that it was anti-traditional Judaism; in a way it supports traditionalism by showing the vapidity of secularism). I mildly recommend it.Why only mildly? Because I think that had Steinberg been willing to write on a higher intellectual plane, this book could have been a great book instead of an OK one. Steinberg keeps asserting that Elisha ben Abuyah (the main character) finds traditional Judaism, and later secularism, intellectually unsatisfying. But he doesn't really explain WHY Elisha found the alternatives so unsatisfying; to do so probably would have required spending dozens (if not hundreds) of pages on theological arguments, and perhaps Steinberg couldn't find a way to make this kind of discussion boht readable and intellectually worthwhile."
4,As a driven leaf,"I chose this book to give myself a fictional 'handle' on some of the personalities shaping the creation of the Talmud. I enjoyed the story, the main character Elisha ('the Other') is a sympathetic if simplistic personification of the conflict between Greek/Roman - Hebrew religion and culture in the period of upheaval and revolt following the destruction of the Second Temple. I read avidly with enjoyment and curiosity, but felt a little cheated none of his characters challenged me to enter an ancient mindset. The motivation of the 'goodies' appears to be loyalty to friends, liberality, honesty and tolerance (all very laudable and modern), whilst the 'baddies' were just sadistic, corrupt or extremist. I wish the author had trusted the reader to work harder."
5,No Less than a Masterpiece!,"I have rarely felt as limited as I do now with being forced to put emotions into words! If you even have enough interest to read this review, you must read the book! Steinberg has given me something I'll never forget in the form of ""As a Driven Leaf!"""
3,historical not contemporary,I bought this book before moving to Tallahassee to learn about my new hometown. The book is a collection of old buildings with two pages devoted to each one. If you are interested in learning about some old homes and buildings this is informative. If you want to learn about life in Tallahassee today it will not help you.
4,I like it!!!!!!!,"I heard the little snip - its of the songs here on Amazon, bought the cd and really like it! I think that it actually sounds a lot like IRIS. They do sound like Cause and Effect meets DM with a little Camouflage. love them all!"
4,A Tribute to Three of the Greatest Klingons of ALL TIME,"Three of the Greatest Klingons since Kahless himself reprise their roles from the original series. Kang (Michael Ansara), Koloth (William Campbell) and Kor (John Colicus) reunite with their old frind Dax to forfil there Bload Oath of 84 years to take vengence for the murders of their first born sons.A trully great episode... I would have given it 5 stars, but I did not like the fact that they did not give Kang and Koloth a chance to come back in further episodes. But still it was great none the less."
1,Please read,"This is not a review. I just did not know where to write to.The Start Trek video information is very, very poor. I really did not expect this from Amazon. There are more than one video manufacturer and episodes numbers vary. How can we choose something without a summary of the story ?????? Also the ""quotes&trivia"" session's text is the same for all episodes. For trivia info, fine, but quotes !!! The headline says quotes from episode XXX and they are all the same - a shame, really."
1,Not a good episode,It had some famous guest stars from Star Trek: TOS but the episode was not a good one.
1,picture is wrong,The picture shows a 4 pin molex to three pin female... the three pin is actually a 3 pin male adapter... so it will not connect to your mobo like it says it will... one of the pins on the molex connectors snapped the first day i had it too... spend the extra money and get quality cables DONT BUY
5,A commercially mishandled CLASSIC,"I'm frankly astonished at the number of negative reviews of this film, but I think I may know the reason why. First of all it seems that all the DVD's out there (the only non DVD-R versions, like Amazon offers, are Region 2) are cut down to full screen instead of giving us the very effective use of the original widescreen. Sin one, as the exceptional camera work drew an Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography.It also appears that the DVD version may have been edited to de-emphasize the pretty blatant sexuality and passion, as it seems to have been marketed after the Sixties as a light hearted romantic comedy. Sin two. It's hardly funny. It's a serious, heart wrenching drama.I just watched the original version on TCM and was blown away by it, especially by Shirley Maclaine's compelling performance, for which she also received an Oscar nomination.Perhaps we can someday look forward to a restored version of the original work. This film deserves it.Very powerful stuff."
4,Growing on You!,"I always am amazed when someone uses the phrase "" against type"" For example , Robert Mitchum, against type stars in "" Two for the Seesaw"" with Shirley MacLaine."" Against type"" thats another typical media throw away to enable any writer to let readers know that he/she has an encyclopedic knowledge of an actors body of work. That knowledge , however is mostly superficial and absurd in its meritsRobert Mitchum was a truly fine actor( when he ""was"" around he would chuckle with the use of any other adjectives..I,m sure)Mitchum was always capable of giving a performance.when required. For a guy with a photographic memory it was easy.He was a natural..and didnt give a damn about the rest of it. Now, some 37 years later we should take another peek at "" Two for the Seesaw"" Is there anything profound being said in this film..no..but is there a reality of character and performance..that few more recent films have attained..without blaring soundtracks..and absurd closeups....You Decide!!CP"
2,Tediously talky relationship study,"I think my title says it all.Other reviews I read indicate this movie was an adaptation from a play, and I'm afraid it really shows. There are incessant dialogues between the two main characters which are tedious and rather stilted. It is established early on that both characters have been badly hurt in previous relationships and are having trouble opening up and becoming vulnerable to one another. These issues are stated and restated too many times during several scenes of the movie.I agree with another reviewer who indicated that there is not a lot of chemistry between the two leads. To tell you the truth, I think Mitchum is miscast. MacLaine is fine; the sweetness and vulnerability underlying her transparent tough-girl facade is a sort of variation on the female lead in her previous film, ""The Apartment."" Come to think of it, I wonder what this movie would have been with Jack Lemmon in place of Robert Mitchum. Oh, well."
2,Yeesh. What a dud.,"Yeesh. One of those dreadful Sixties Dramas (please note the portentious use of Capital Letters) that are Boldly Adapted from a Stage Play, and full of Psychology-laden monologues and horrendously overwritten, absurdly unnatural-sounding repartee. Shirley MacLaine is a ""bohemian"" Jewish girl, living in the nutty clamour of Greenwich Village (which we see very little of, sadly), and Robert Mitchum is the ""square"" from Omaha who barges into her life and begins bossing her around, in an effort to recapture his Lost Masculinity. The film is interminable and way too stagey. MacLaine has some winsome moments, and the B&W cinematography is kinda nice, but nothing can save this overly-mannered shipwreck from foundering, again and again, on the shoals of its own pretensions. I guess in some ways I feel lucky that I wasn't living in New York back in the Kennedy era, when you'd have to go to the theatre and take this sort of boring pseudo-sermonizing seriously."
2,"""Doesn't hold up"" is an understatement","I'll be brief: I viewed Seesaw recently on TCM after not having seen it for many years. I had fond memories of the film when I originally saw it back in the late '60s. However, upon seeing it again, I was very disappointed, realizing that it is now a completely dated, unendurably sexist flick. In one uncomfortable scene, Mitchum slaps MacLaine forcefully on the face...both agreeing, of course, that she totally deserved it.Ugh. Retire this one for good."
4,Good camera,This is a good camera for the money......I use a 35mm at times instead of my digital...this is great for the price.
4,camera for the dummies,I like this camera. I took it to Ireland with me and we just snapped away. I took the film to a cheap department store to get it processed and the pictures are wonderful. They are clear and persise. If I loose this camera or drop it I won't have a heart attack. It didn't cost that much to begin with. I run though the batteries a little sooner. But this is because I play with the zoom lens a lot. It's just a nice little camera that I can pack around and not worry to much about. The pictures are great....
5,Easy To Use Camera,"This is a great little camera that you can take on the go. It's SO easy to use. I have several cameras, but I find myself grabbing this one when I'm running out the door and think, ""I should take a camera."" I like the way the cover slides over to protect the lens. When you open that, it turns it on and you're ready to go. The zoom is adequate for 95% of the shots I want to take. The photo quality is very good for a compact camera. I like mine so much, I just ordered another one to give as a Christmas present."
3,Small Camera-average quality prints,This little camera has some nice features but really does not take any better pictures than my Fuji which was 1/2 the price.There does seem to be a lot of difference in print quality depending on the finishing lab.
4,Very Interesting Book!,"As an admirer of Gen. Lee and as a Texan, the title and cover of the book grabbed my attention. There's an awful lot written about Lee's Civil War exploits and even a fair about of info about his Mexican War experiences. Unfortunately there's almost nothing written about the years immediately preceding the Civil War. This book covers that. If you're familiar with geographics of Texas, you'll especially find the book interesting. Lee journeyed through West Texas, South Texas, the border area along the Rio Grande and the Hill country in and around San Antonio. He chased Commanches (who proved quite elusive) and bandits throughout West and South Texas. The book is an easy read. If you've read much about Lee at all, you should get this book. For anyone who's a Civil War/Lee buff and if you've spent any time in Texas at all, it's a must have."
2,very disappointed.. nice design.. shoddy craftmanship,"After 3 months of normal usage, the large inside pocket ripped at the seams. I contacted Tucano for a replacement as they have a '2-year guarantee'. They were nice at first but continued to give me the runaround, and eventually ceased to respond to my emails.picture of product in question:[...]"
3,Received a different pattern completly,"I give a generous 3 stars because this shirt looks nice and was folded nicely when I received it but instead of the airplane theme I thought I was getting for my Dad who is a pilot and engineer of airplanes, I got old fashioned cars with Hawaiian flowers as the pattern. Totally different colors than what is shown as well. Very strange!"
4,Good disaster movie...,I'm a fan of any disaster movie and this one even though a touch predictable at times presents a believable story. Fast shipment too!
4,good movie worth seeing 10 years later,"Considering what happened to New Orleans after Katrina in 2005, this movie seems even more up to date. It shows the world 10 years in our future (2017) where global warming is taking her toll. The sad part is that most of what the movie portrays has come true. Fires rampant on the west coast and a hurricane devastated Louisiana. I saw this 10 years ago when it came out and feared this might happen. Anyone who sees this film should also check out ""An inconvenient truth"", the movie Al Gore made. If these two movies don't scare you into conservation; nothing will."
3,The Science is good,"This mini series from 1993 is not too bad-the first part is better then the second however.The story is pretty much on target for climate change/global warming as regards to heat, floods, diseases & social dislocation.It also has the same 'deniers' of CO2 greenhouse gases saying that 'nothing is wrong' when the whole planet is changing."
1,Don't buy it!,"After only a few CD&Gs were played, the audio started skipping and the video jumbled to the point of being unreadable."
1,Don't buy this one,"After only a few CD&Gs were played, the machine started skipping and the video was scrambled to the point that you could not read it. We feel that we were taken for a ride on this one."
3,No problems so far!,"My daughter got this machine for Christmas and has played with it almost continuously for the past two weeks. It seems a little flimsy, but so far we have had no trouble with it."
1,this machine stinks,"Hello. I am a mother of a 5 year old. He doesn't know how to type very well, so I am typing for him. And this is what my son says :""I would have given this 'toy' ZERO stars, but it wasn't an option. I like to sing, I hope I'm the next Eminiem. But of course, I don't use naughty language. I hope you lose your job.""LoveBilly Bob Braxon"
5,Okay,"Most people say this machine is not cool at all. Some say it is great! I say it is between what both people said. My daughter had lots of fun with this! Even I did. It has Okay sound, Okay size, and Okay overall. I like this karaoke, but I would buy a different one."
3,"A good novel capturing the despair and hope of Russia,","To date, this is Plante's worst novel. Having said that, one must realise that his worst novel is usually better than someone else's best. The action is normally in disarray, but it seems intended. The dialouge is wonderful, yet somehow too much a part of this book. There are moments of his standard setting tight, lyrical writing, but in no way does it ever match the continuity of his novels Annuncition or The Accident, to name his most recent. Overall, it is a good read, but left me thirsting for the older days. Perhaps his signing with St. Martins press has made a difference for the worst, but I have faith that the next book will be better."
3,Turkey 1905,"For some info: ""The Real Turk"" by Stanwood Cobb, 1914 first ed., The Pilgrim Press, 301 pgs. (From a seller's review:) ""Contents: The author spent 3 years in Turkey and covers all aspects of Turkish life: climate, government, business, life of the Turkish Lady, domestic habits, education, American influence on Turkish education, Islam, Sunnis and Shiites, Bahaism, Howling Dervishes, faith healing and much more."""
5,About Barbie Personal CD Player by KIDdesigns.Inc,"Hi,my name is Rika.I'll have been 18years old on 25th this month.I love Barbie very very much. And,I love the Barbie Personal CD Player!! It's so cute! So,I really love to get it! But I'm Japanese. So I can't,cause I live in Japan,get it. There is no Barbie goods like this in this place.I can't find even at the TOYSRUS shop here. But I really want. I really wish I could get it even I'm in Japan. I'm sorry my English is may hard to understand. But thank you for reading. Good Bye!"
5,the real thing!,I was very hesitant to purchase perfume from amazon espically since the seller wasn't Amazon itself. I receieved the product in just a few days and it is the real deal :-)
5,Customer Review,Excellent sevice by this seller. The product arrived sooner than promised and the condition of the product exactly as described by the seller. We're very happy with the purchase.
2,Sucked,After seeing the first Motives which was sooo good I was excited to see Motives 2. However I was dissappointed. This film is so boring to me. And the fact that Emory's brother shows out of nowhere and is able solve the crime is a little unrealistic. Despite this drabby film I did enjoy Sean Blakemore(Brandon Collier) and Mel Jackson's performance. This film just didn't do it for me.
4,more complex than the first,"I didn't completely understand everything in this film until I watched it twice. It's considerably more complex than Motives. It's full of intrigue and I like how the story progresses. Very intelligently gone and classy. The acting was fair, but some of the scenes were badly made (particularly the fighting scences). I don't want to see a sequel to this but would love to see more films of this type (African American erotic thrillers)."
2,Good Movie,"I love the actors and the movie was good; however, I was looking for something more from this movie. I was excited to purchase it, but after watching it, I thought it was only good."
2,Motives 2,"I finally sat down to watch this sequel during check-in at Morehouse College and I can't say whether or not I was disappointed. This wasn't as sexy as the first, Sean Blakemore simply read his way through the part, and Joe Torry basiclally played the same role he did in Poetic Justice. Brian White gives a dead-on personification of Shemar Moore's role in the first film, so it was believeable that he was an estranged brother. I thought the plot wasn't as tightly wound as the first, but everything seemed to pull together at the end, which kinda didn't make sense: did Connie plan to use Brandon all the while? That was a lingering question for me.And what was Drew Sidora's role in the movie? I thought her character was way too needy and infrequent for me to care about."
3,Rent Motives 2 Buy Motives 1,"Rent it. Does not live up to the first one. It would have been great if Shemar Moore's character had been in this one some where. There was no romance for Vivica and the new husband who supposedley set up Shemar's character all for love of her. Sean Blakemoore's character of Donovan was so so sexy and mysterious in the first one; he was just creepy in this one. all his machismo was gone. Rent it. Watch it twice to understand it. Buy Motives 1, it is still one of the best black mystery romance suspense movies out there. I wish Motives 2 was as good."
4,A pretty good one,"This one is worth the effort if you enjoy African-American themed movies. It had a great cast and the plot was interesting, though predictable at times. All-in-all, a pretty good movie to curl up with on a lonely night (the men are great eye candy). :)"
3,This one was ok.,"The first ""Motives"" was better in my opinion, although, this one did bring about closure to the first one because of what happened to ""Shemar Moore's character in Pt. 1. I was glad to see that justice kind of prevailed."
3,Puzzling,"I think Motives 2 is an excellent movie, even though, one must have watched Motives 1 to fully understand this twisted mystery. Napping in between settings is most definitely not recommended.....Put on your P.I. thinking cap!"
4,one man's trash is another man's treasure.,"one man's trash is another man's treasure. shame on those who do not appreciate their aging parents. in this case Shahshank (Jimmy) recognizes treasure in 3 older men who are full of life and love and talent that their families have either ignored or exploited without respect, appreciation or love. wake up families!"
4,"History, Education, Entertainment","This is more documentary than entertainment. If someone wants to have an historical/philosophical perspective, this is it, but it is also well done and nicely photographed. I enjoyed it and then donated it to a Zen Center for teaching purposes. If someone wants to be entertained and also learn about the historical Buddha and his philosophy, then The Little Buddha with Keanu Reeve is a good choice."
4,Commentary,"Life of Buddha.Documentary on the historical Buddha. Excellent commentary from traditional storytellers, archaeologist, historians and senior members of the Sangha. Visits the sacred/ historical places of Guru Shakyamuni's life. Superb."
2,Not what I expected,It's a narrative. I thought it would be the life of Buddha as portrayed by actors. Kinda dry. The cover art is beautiful tho.
2,Totally out of date with regard to technology and options available,"Dating from 1993 this is already totally out of date, with the Simpson-Lawrence Delta (now made in China and sold by Lewmar) being the most recent design discussed.Recent anchor types such as Spade, Bulwagga, and Rocna have made the traditional plows, claws, and Danforth-types all but obsolete.A revision that devotes a chapter to these newer designs is badly needed. In the meantime do not look to this book for advice with regard to choosing an anchor for your boat."
1,Don't buy - Won't get it,"I purchased this vest on November 30. Said it was in stock with delivery estimate Dec 9. Received email from Jos. A. Bank on Dec 1 saying it was ""being processed."" Next email from Jos. A. Banks came, two weeks later, on Dec 14 saying merchandise is ""no longer available."" So much for a Christmas vest."
5,Nice little toy cap gun,"I purchased this for my 5 year old grandson since he liked my old 1950 cap gun. This one is smaller so it fits him better than my old one. The cap rolls that came with it are terrible so bought some cheap ones locally and they work great. Loading the caps are a little difficult for a child. That's okay by me as I can control the amount of caps used by doing the loading process. If you give a kid a box of 1,000 caps, they will shoot them all in one day."
5,Blue Book of Gun Values,"As a Gun Dealer (Firearms of America) this is an essential tool in valuing guns. As a gun owner it's an invaluable tool to value my personal collection and very useful in purchasing previously owned guns, especially at Gun Shows. This a great tool for every gun owner."
5,Blue Book of Gun Values,"Excellent book, great value. Lots of good information useful to even the most well-versed in the industry."
2,Overcome by technology,"This book is useful in tracing an unusual firearm and linking to quantity manufactured. It also provides some generally accepted guidelines, a common taxonomy, for the condition of used firearms. This is something many less than scrupulous gun sellers seem to lack.Unfortunately, the pricing information is seriously out of wack for the majority of the firearms listed. Prices listed/realized on the many popular gun auction sites are almost higher than those listed in this book. The pricing information contained in this book is only of use to a less than honest buyer working with a naive seller."
4,Blue Book of Gun Values 27th Edition,Tells you everything you wanted to know about the worth of guns and rifles.
5,Bible for gun collectors and traders,"If you have only one book for valuing your guns, this is the one to buy. It is the reference used by most all dealers when establishing value of guns. Guns are shown for each manufacturer by type - pistol, revolver, shotguns, rifles, etc. A simple explanation of each model is given with values for options and condition of the gun. If you collect guns, get this latest issue and be on the same level as the dealers where you trade."
3,Dissapointed that the 19th edition had deleations.,First read the 18th edition at the library! So impressed I ordered the new 19th edition. To my dissapointment the entire BLACK POWDER section was removed. You can buy a (separate) book that Blue Book Pub. offers!
3,"Blue Book of Gun Values, 27th Edition",A good book that is not to easy to understand. I was able to find the info I needed.
3,"Blue Book of Gun Values, 27th Edition",A quite complete reference work wich is very handy if you need to look up something fast. European guns are more or less overrated.
4,Very good guide; only lacking photos,"This book covers an extensive array of firearms and prices for varying conditions. It is an excellent reference. All it needs is photos of the firearm described. There are small variances in many, particularly the Winchesters, that may make them difficult to identify without a photo."
3,Military weapons are low,"I deal with guns on a daily basis and I refer to this book several times a day. Most of the values listed in the book seem to correspond with the market. However, U.S. military firearms and some of the Colt pistols are listed too low. For collecting purposes the descriptions are too vague. I refer to the many auction sights and specialty dealers on line that list these types of weapons for sale. Some of these dealers are are highly reputable and published authors on US martial weapons.These types of firearms increase in value quickly as the interest in U.S.military history grows. This book does not reflect the rapid increase in value that these guns have made in the past few years. Overall this book is very useful, but when researching the value of a specific military weapon, consult the internet or buy a book."
5,Accurate and Concise. Rely on it before I Buy. Collector,When I need to know Manufacture dates and model differences and values I rely on this guide. Covers rare/common and hard to price American and European models. Has a cross Reference for makers and serial # made on dates. Shows the listing of model variations/dates/serial # runs in a series of gun. All one needs is the Gun in hand or complete list of features to determine Model/Type & Era. Each listing has the wording on the barrel of each model it covers to determine the type. No guide can be complete end of story. This gude takes you where you need to be to determine Type and value.
3,disappointed that there are no antique or modern black powder as in previous book...,disappointed that there are no antique or modern black powder guns shown or reviewed as in previous books.
4,gun book del.,"thank you for my blue book of gun. but the only problem i have is , when it was del to my door the book came out of the box it was in and hit ground and damaged the cover and the first 10 pages of book. the box was not sealed on ether end."
5,best book for gun values,I am a gun owner and i buy and sell them at times. this book is great for finding the values of the guns I am buying or selling so that i don't get screwed. i buy one about every other year. great book
5,Blue Book of Gun Values,"This was a purchase for my husband, and since he received it, he hasn't put it down. It has information that details specifics and values. He has always used this book as it comes out yearly. Thanks for helping him to keep up-to-date."
4,An Important Resource!,"I own and operate a gun safety and firearm education Web site online with more than 510,000 visitors. I get asked about firearm values for certain guns from all over the world every week.As I type this, The Blue Book of Gun Values is less than three feet away from me at all times.There are many firearm values books out there and if you're a collector, you will need more than just this one. But you should own at least this one if nothing else.Why wonder how much that gun is really worth? Get the book and look it up..."
3,blue book of gun values,It show different price the old book shows $1800.00.the new book show it $870.00 and it is perfect grade.
3,blue book of gun prices,"I got this book thinking it would offer me a warriors code of values I could follow... and then break because I'm a renegade - a real wild card. This book is actually just a bunch of gun prices. I don't know why I need a book of prices because if I want to buy a gun I'll just check the price before I buy it. I guess it makes comparative shopping easy, but all of these guns in this book are too expensive for me anyways."
1,Really?,I bought the 27th edition of this book 4 years ago. I thought it was time to upgrade and purchase a more current copy so I ordered the 31st edition. Many of the prices in the 31st edition showed normal increases in value as expected but a surprising number of listings in the two editions did not show any change. None! Entire sections in the 31st edition appeared to be exact reprints of the 27th edition. Really? Entire sections? Don't waste you money on this reference guide. It appears the editors just do random updates and change the cover. I will never buy any future editions of this book.
3,"Great for pricing, not so for serialization.","This book is great. It has almost every firearm listed, has full color photos of different grades, as well as how to grade your firearms. The complete source for grading and pricing. However, the serialization section is full of holes. I was expecting a more complete listing, but it leaves you wanting more."
3,Errors and omissions.,I was disappointed at the number of errors and omissions I found when I looked up information on new 2002 and older Savage rifles that I was interested in purchasing and had independently researched. If it has so many problems w/guns I'm very familiar with it raises doubts in my mind as to its reliability with its other gun listings.
3,"OK, but difficult to use.","I've found this book rather difficult to use.. Finding your particular gun(s) in this book is often much harder than I believe it should be in this day and age.. While there is a wealth of information in this book, it's not all that well organized when looking for a specific model of gun, and finding a particular model is quite often a task rather than the enjoyable experience it should be for the money. It's also not complete. Not every gun is listed there dispite its size and cost. It also doesnt include black powder guns which I found disturbing. While it's OK for its intended purpose I really believe that in todays computer age this could have been done much better for the money.. I'd be hard pressed to buy another edition without looking at competing products first."
3,BLUE BOOK OF GUN VALUES PRICING UNDERRATED,PRICING IS NOT UP TO DATE ON MANY FIREARMS IN TODAYS CURRENT MARKET PLACE. I PREFER THE 2010 STANDARD CATALOG OF FIREARMS AND THE PICTURES IN IT ARE VERY HELPFUL.
4,Blue Book Review,Great book for every gun lover. Easy up look-up and good details. A must have for anyone interested in the value of guns.
5,Blue Book of Gun Values Subject,"I have, and sell many firearms. If ya want a totally comprehensive up to date, through and easy to understand book on firearm values....this IS THE ONE to have folks. Hands and feet...leaps and bounds above all the rest!!"
4,A must have in my work,I am a gun dealer by trade and this is just a must have.. Some of the pricing is way off but 99% is just about right.. Now if people can understand that there beat up old mossberg shotgun is not worth 100 value we will be good to go..lol There needs to be mor ein the front of the book that tells how to rate a gun...
5,Can't live with out it,"For what I do, this book is the Holy Grail, Its awesome and informative. If you're a collector, in the firearm sports or just want some of the best knowledge out there on firearm pricing, its a must have."
4,Good Basic Gun book,"If you need just a quick and dirty ""appraisal"" of your firearms, this is the place to go. You can see in an instant if you are getting the best price for your firearms, or if someone is trying to rip you off! All of the manufacturers options are listed too, so don't believe the guy that tells you he paid extra for an option that doesn't even exist. This is a good place to start, for beginners to experts. Well laid out, easy to find info."
3,Good book,"This book has a ton of guns in it, but there are lack of images that can help you determine the gun that you are looking for. It demonstates ways to use the scale to determine the quality of the firearm as well. There are also multiple versions of each firearm. Great for dealers, but for the common gun enthusiast, you may want to look into a book with more images and more basic pricing on general firearms."
3,good reference,The book has since been replaced by a newer one is only a starting point in pricing guns. Has a good pictorial guide to visual condition appraisal such as percent of bluing according to a trained eyeball. A better price can be had by referring to sites such as gun broker for current pricing. An expensive book for one that goes out of date in a matter of months...
5,Awesome Brazilian Reggae!,"I picked this up in Salvadore da Bahia, Brazil because I was staying with some local Rastas who played it continuosly. Since I have bought it, I've done the same. If you like reggae but want to hear something a little out of the ordinairy, buy this CD. Every song is worth it."
5,excelent!!,"excelent watch! very elegant! I recommend it for day and night and the price is great! excelente reloj, muy elegante! lo recomiendo para usar de dia y de noche."
5,Awesome Elegant Watch,"I bought this watch for my husband. He usually uses Bulova Watches. This watch is so beautiful the online picture does not give it enough credit. This is a screw on crown and the date and time are easily set up. The second hand is actually the little hand inside the middle circle; the second hand on the traditional placement actually is the chronometer along with the pointer on the left circle that tells minutes.This watch does not look like a hundred dollar watch; it has a much more expansive look. It is somewhat heavy and the face is quite big, so little wrists may have trouble wearing it correctly. The leather is nicely crafted and stitched without any issues.It has 100% Japan movement and it is water resistant to 100 feet. So far it has been right on time and no issues at all. Awesome watch for the money."
1,An unhelpful article about some vicious aggressors,"This is a horribly biased and misleading article. Although Margot Patterson quotes several people, none of these quotes so much as hint at the fact that Hezbollah is basically an aggressive gang of anti-Jewish thugs. Yes, various groups of people have, um, ""stood up to the Jews"" in the past. But that has not necessarily been heroic. And what Hezbollah is doing is not heroic. Patterson should have made that clear.We readers are asked to accept arbitrary claims that Israel, not Hezbollah has been the primary violator of agreements. Well, is that true? Actually, it isn't, and Patterson ought to have pointed that out."
3,Great book,"Good book for a overview of the combustion process and some basic engineering calculations, but i missed numeric examples instead of only application formulas."
4,Grandson gift,The gift was purchased for my 12 year old grandson. It was a little difficult for him to get it right buit in time he was doing it ok.
3,hand held sudoku,"Bought this mostly for trips. Disappointed that background does not light up, but okay for the price.Easy to use, but need tiny screw driver to remove cover to replace batteries."
5,My NEW Favorite Book!,"I LUVED this book. The characters were fresh and realistic. Both Jane and Raleigh charmed me for precisely the reason other reviewers have damned them; they're human. They have their faults. I'm sick to death of perfect characters in romance novels! Raleigh and Jane are wonderfully neurotic and the storyline isn't overshadowed by the characters, as is too often the case in this genre. Bravo!"
1,"Bad, bad, bad","Can anyone please expain why Raleigh fell in love with the thoroughly unlikeable Jane? There is not a single paragraph in this story in which Jane speaks with even a smidgen of, well, fondness for Raleigh. It is thoroughly unreasonable to expect that the fun, handsome Raleigh would even look twice at someone a) so unattractive and b) more importantly, so nasty. I like Deb Simmons books but this one failed to live up to her previous romances and left the reader feeling very sorry for poor Raleigh."
1,simply awful,"Poor Raleigh - to be stuck married to Jane the Shrew, well, what did he do to deserve such punishment. It seems those readers who liked this story liked the fact that Jane was an unattractive female and they liked that change from the usual pretty regency miss. Well, sure, okay, she is unattractive but she is even more unattractive on the inside and that is what makes the story so bad. Bad attitude, behavior and general unpleasantness do not, I repeat, do not make for an entertaining story or a great romance."
5,This is a great book if ......,"This is a great book if you enjoy characters with real motivations, and frames of references that have been built from their own backgrounds and experiences. This author is truly amazing, as she has not pandered to the shallow, low quality and high selling plots that feature stereotyped personalities secretly hankering after one another in cookie cutter fashion.Who wants an author to tell them everyone is beautiful, dashing, intelligent, witty, or whatnot. As in real life, I want to discover these things myself as I read. Of course, I recognize that many readers need the fairy tale plots - and so if you are one of those, this book is not for you. I enjoyed this book a lot and will be looking for more of this author's work."
1,"Im sorry, was this suppose to be entertainment?","UGH...Man, a book has to be REALLY bad for me to give it 1 star....I was so bored by this that I actually stopped reading it and shelved it when I was only 10 pages away from the ending. First we have Jane. She was SO RUDE.. I swear if she sniffed or squeaked one more time, I was ready to pitch this book out the window! Then there was Raleigh who was constantly described as emitting a low hum and caring more about his attire than all else. Oh yeah, he sounds like the man of my dreams. The ""plot"" revolves around a bit of a mystery which is just too stupid to even contemplate. For me, the only mystery of this book is how in the heck these two people fell in love!! I especially felt bad for Raleigh when all Jane did was B**ch and moan at him all day long....How this was published.. I have no idea....there are too many books and too little time to waste it on this mess. In my humble opinion....I say skip it."
5,Excellent primer on advertising,One of the best primers on the advertising agency business for young people looking for a career in advertising. Teaches you about the types of jobs available in the agency business
2,INSIGHT FROM A BOTOX PRACTITIONER,"I bought this book for patient education for the waiting room at the same time I bought ""The Botox Book"" by Dr. Michael Kane. I found Dr. Kane's book much more well explained, comprehensive and (even) more accurate. Dr. Kane is a researcher as well as a highly skilled practitioner, and lectures and publishes articles on Botox in professional venues (The American Society of Plastic Surgeons, etc.) ""The Botox Book"" is far superior to this one in every aspect."
3,"Flat, but cute","This book is cute, but ultimately leaves you wanting more. The bones for a good book are there. Interesting concept and characters, but the author fails to flesh out her writing. It isn't a book to warn against or recommend, it is just eh. I'm glad I am a fast reader and it only cost $.99."
4,The Frog Princess: A Magical Fun Romp,"It's a charming tale about a princess meeting a frog. Our Princess Emma, short for Emeralda, meets a frog in the swamp behind her palace who claims he is a prince (of course!). Emma doesn't quite believe Prince Eadric but due to her loneliness at the castle and considering his somewhat annoying compansionship is the best friendship she's ever had she decides to kiss him.She kisses him and SHE turns into a frog! Stunned at first, Emma quickly likes the freedom her transformation brings her. Eadric and Emma can't figure out why the witch's curse isn't undone so they embark on a froggy adventure to find the witch.A number of animal friends are made along the way and Baker creates a cohesive and magical world for these characters to inhabit. I went on to read three more books in this series that give Emma and Eadric a past, a future and so many adventures."
2,"Disappointing, Starts Out Cute and Fizzles to Dreadful",I read the mixed reviews before choosing to read this book to my six year old daughter. When I began this story I thought it was cute and I enjoyed the detailed descriptions from the princess' perspective. But as the book went on I found myself dreading reading more. The story is very simple and wouldn't have been so bad if the author had stayed focused and edited out about 50 pages. At the end it seems like book soup with a variety of leftovers thrown in to make it last longer. It really ruined the flavor for me.This may be better for the young independent reader and parents reading aloud might want to try 'The Prince of the Pond: Otherwise Known as De Fawg Pin' by Donna Jo Napoli instead. Which I thought was cute and charming.
2,Cutesy but unsustainable romance,"I don't know. I am usually the girl that falls head over heels for anything related to the fairy tale genre. So this really should have been up my alley. But it seemed to me that nothing could be properly focused. Don't get me wrong; it was a nice enough plot with some great creative ideas somewhere in the background. But for the life of me I could not figure out what this silly bunch of characters was trying to do. And this really could have been a great book. After all, it's the Frog Prince story with a twist. And that is a fairy tale where one could go far with a twist. But a cutesy bash of fluffy plot and poor character development did not add up to much for me."
2,Bought for my granddaughter,"Bought for my granddaughter who is an avid reader at the age of 8 and she just cannot get into it. I have not read it, but if she does not care for the story I cannot give it a good rating."
2,Mildly Pleasant Fluff,"In food terms, this book would be comparable to having eaten three or four gummi bears and having an umpleasantly sweet taste in your mouth. Princess kisses frog to free him from an enchantment, finds herself turned into a frog too, both of them set out to find a way to free themselves of the spell. Cute, but not very memorable. I think they're making a movie out of it. Maybe this will be the one time the movie is better than the book!"
2,Not too shabby,It got a little wordy at times and hard to follow. But it was a cute story. I guess it's a good story for a younger audience.
5,GREAT!!!!!!!,This book is great!I really enjoyed reading it. My friend gave my 3 of the 8 books. I am on number three - but anyway a great buy! U won't be disappointed! Well worth it! A comedy for family and a little bit romantic! :) <3
3,Enjoyable for a younger audience,"This story follows Princess Emma and Prince Eadric after her attempts to turn him back into a prince go awry. They struggle through a number of perilous situations in order to become human again.Overall, I enjoyed this book. I thought the characters were fun and likeable. With that said, there was something that felt a little flat about the story. There was no real feeling of danger or excitement to the situations and sometimes it felt that solutions to problems came so easily there was little point in introducing the problems in the first place. In the end, though, I liked it enough to finish it and want the main characters to end up together. I would just recommend this book to a younger audience--perhaps those that enjoy the Charlie Bone series."
4,The Frog Princess,"Ever wish you were a princess? Emma is the princess in The Fog Princess by E.D. Baker. This book has to be fantasy and takes place in medieval time. Emma, the Princess, wishes that her mother would stop trying to marry her off and just wants to be a normal girl, until she met Eadric. Eadric claims to be a Prince but is currently supporting a frog form. He trys to use the most common method of saving himself, a kiss form a princess.Eadric diligently persuades the stubborn princess and finally convinces her to give him a kiss. As she leans down and kisses him she is surprised to find that instead of Eadric becoming a human, she became a frog!I thought this was an Interesting book but unless you enjoy bickering frogs then you should not read this book. This book might be on my favorites list just because of its humor. I enjoyed the thrilling and fatal situations they got themselves into."
4,Enjoyable Read,"This was my first romance by Karen Robards and I was not disappointed. I enjoyed the transformation from ""Jewel"" to ""Julia"", the secondary characters added much to the story line, and all in all - it was a believable story that will have one laughing, crying, and rooting for Julia up until the very end."
5,Wonderfully written!,"Loving Julia is by far the best book I have read so far! What can I say, the story is full of emotions. You can never tell what can happen with each turn of a page. The heroine is full of character. She is strong, but loving at the same time. Sebastian is a bit callous at times, but anyone would learn to love him as the hero after reading this excellent novel. I believe the character development between these two were just remarkable. There is not anything quite like this book. It is a must read page turner. I adore this book and it surely stands out because it is NOT ORDINARY!"
1,No Loving Julia,"I read this book because I had just finished Karen Robard's ""This Side of Heaven"", which was clever, funny, and so unusual.""Loving Julia"" was such a disappointment. Julia acted like a tramp and then got insulted when she was treated like one.I felt absolutely nothing for Sebastian, except that he was a borish bully with too much money and too much time on his hands.This book was much the same as other Regency romances. In the end I expected that it would be discovered she was a princess or some other ridiculous thing, but thank heavens we were spared that."
2,So much potential...,"I realize this is a late 80s book, but for several reasons I couldn't finish it.First, the age difference between the h/h.Secondly, the book was told from the heroine's p-o-v. I never knew what Sebastian was feeling or thinking.I also didn't think there was anything endearing about the hero at all. He seemed cold and uneeling even towards the end.I have read several rags-to-riches romances and loved them, but this one didn't move me. While the heroine was plucky, she was also a doormat. The hero was extremely arrogant and I couldn't understand what she loved about him."
2,yikes,"i love karen robards and i wanted to love this book. I know it was written a long time ago, so i allow for changes in style... but the fact is that it just doesn't hold up anymore. The story is just too too cliche. Sometimes the characters are strong enough to make up for a lame plot, but not this time. And the ending literally made me groan out loud. I would have thrown the book across the room if I hadn't been reading it on my PC. Yikes."
2,Not what I'd expect from a Robards book.,I wanted to give this book one star but couldn't because it started off great but went downhill fast. I don't see any woman putting up with the crap he was laying on her. The constant mood swings were giving me whiplash. Not pleased with this one.
2,One Important Byrd Was Involved,"While I agree with the overall thrust of the other customer review, his comment that none of the original Byrds played on this CD is not strictly correct. Several of the songs were co-written by Gene Clark, who (with Jim McGuinn) was one of the two first members of what became the Byrds. Gene left after the group's second Columbia album. On ""Most Famous Hits,"" Gene signs lead on ""My Marie"", ""Washington Square,"" and several others. A number of these songs are not readily available elsewhere. If you are looking to hear The Byrds, don't buy this CD. But, if you are an avid Gene Clark fan, there is some good stuff here."
4,Nice mini keyboard!,"I am typing this review on the keyboard. Touch-typing is not bad. Do not expect the speeds of a full-sized IBM clicker, though ;). I get about 30 wpm. Unlike other mini keyboards that reviewers said felt cheap, this one feels solid to me. It's stiff in structure and the keys feel like a decent - albeit tiny - laptop keyboard. The laptop feel is, in part, due to the laptop-style scissor keys - a feature I did not see listed on other mini keyboards. There are two aspects to this keyboard that will irritate, only left shift and single quote next to space bar. Command-line work may take some getting used to on this keyboard with these new key positions, but, then again, if you are going for something this small and light, you should not be expecting to use it in the same way as a full keyboard. If you want small and fully functional, try a Happy Hacker keyboard ;). I give it a solid 4 stars."
2,Wisdom's Daughter : A Novel of Solomon and Sheba,not a realy story. had trouble completing the book. because it turn into to much of a love story and miss the point of a woman of wisdom.
3,Tough to read lightly...,"This book is written very well; however, as a light read, it is hard to follow if you haven't read it for a few days.There are too many characters, and the author jumps from one character's perspective to another. I initally thought this was a neat way to write the story, but when you like a certain character, you may not hear from or about that character for another hundred pages!If you can sit down one weekend and read it, I'm sure it'll finish up great (I lost interest about 3/4 of the way through it, and didn't finish), but if you plan to read this over a few weeks--it is too drawn out and hard to follow!"
5,Fantastic Read!,I've read a few books about Solomon and Sheba but this gave me a completely different view on the story - Sheba's point of view. I read this book cover to cover and only put it down once to go to bed! I fell into the pages and became part of the story and afterwards felt like I'd been on an adventure myself. Perfect for the vacation I read it on.
4,"Great microphone, but no case!","There are plenty of reviews concerning these mics, and I agree with most of them. They work well, but keep plenty of batteries on hand! The only issue I had (HAD) was that Shure does not make a case for this! I bought the Pelican 1495 case1495NF,WL/NF,BLACKand am happy to report it fits everything in this kit, plus 2x XLR to XLR and 2x XLR to TRS. The case is kinda expensive, but is very heavy duty (and waterproof!)."
3,Shure PG288/PG58,"I ordered this product, when trying using its did not function, quality as I expected.so I return this Item."
3,good mics,mics are pretty good. Seems like they work best for singing if they are run through a compressor. They don't run rechargeable batteries totally dead which poses a problem on the recharge.
2,poor implementation,"It's a tough job to add a useful keypad to a device that wasn't built with that in mind. This one is very lightweight, so the balance of the combined palm (m515 in my case) and thumb board is wrong, which further aggravates typing, and of course it's a hassle to use if you have the palm in a case of some sort.The supplied software didn't work with the m515 at all--it never noticed the device. I had to download an update from the manufacturer's website, which itself is very hard to find (the actual manufacturer is sakar).But it does work. Unfortunately you have to use the blue FN key to enter numbers, and the space key is unnecessarily small. For some idiotic reason there's no semicolon key (shifted, FNed, or otherwise). Perhaps a better idea would be a cabled or wireless keyboard, rather than this. I doubt I'll end up using it very often."
2,Worked for 3.5 years,"Worked well for 3.5 years, but then the flyback went out on it. I do not think a tv as new as it was should be going out so soon. Will probably just buy a new TV since the repair will cost almost half of what it is worth."
5,good to move to,The is a marvelous dvd for seniors and very thorough. Don't let the outdated appearance turn you off. The dvd is better than that.
2,Very disappointed,"I asked my sister to get this for my daughter's birthday. In hindsight, I think there were better tents for the money. It's not made to be outside at all, and I'm not talking about camping over night; it does not play outside well. It tips over real easy. Also, when I folded it up for storage, it really warped the frame. It's taken forever to straighten it out.I think a more squared tent would be a better buy. Keep looking."
4,Pop goes the tent,"I bought this tent for my grandaughter, she loves it, her mom loves it too because she didn't have to call her neighbor over to help her put it together, it just 'pop't' open. It is large enough for several small 2 or 3 year olds to crawl around in. My grandaughter thinks its wonderful, she slept in it for two weeks before her mother could get her to go to bed again. It fold very flat and fits under the bed very nicely. Altogether I'd say this Gramma is quite pleased. Thanx Amazon."
1,"An oven, no air or light","This is a really cute little tent, however, it is the hottest thing. I thought there would be a hole in the top or something, but there isn't. Yes, the door rolls up, but how many kids are going to want the door open? It's dark and seriously hard to breath in after a few minutes. I've been in there w/her and have had to leave after only about a minute. Yes, it's cool that it folds up, but so what, lots of them do now. I would never, ever let her ""camp out"" for an extended period of time out of fear she would pass out. I'm thinking about putting some grommets (sp?) in the top just to get some air in it. She loves it, but doesn't play for long because she get so dang hot. Be aware there is NO AIR HOLES when/if you buy this."
3,Dora Play Tent,"This was a lot of fun, just wish it was sewn a little stronger. After a few months of play the slots the poles go through started to come unsewn which made the tent not stay up as well. Still alot of fun!"
1,Waste of money,"Very cute design but is very flimsy. It barely stays up. It's made of cheap felt like material and Getting it folded up is a complete hassle. I wouldnt bother with this product, I would spend the money and purchase something thats better ."
2,"Fun, but flimsy","My daughter received this from a friend for her 2nd birthday, and took to it immediately. She adores having a ""house"" to go into, and spends a lot of time running in and out.It does not stay up on its own, though, so I spend a lot of time responding to ""Uh oh, Mama, House fell over!"" I thought for sure we must be missing a part or something, in order for it to be SO unstable, but it's pretty clear from the responses here that that's not the case. You barely need to tap it, and it falls over. If there were a way to anchor the tips on the feet, it would be better.It's not the most sturdily-constructed toy, but I wouldn't expect it to be, for the price. I expect when this goes, we'll buy a kid's tent instead."
2,This toy is annoying,I was disappointed in this tent. It doesn't stay up very well and is impossible to collapse for clean up. My 2 year daughter loves Dora but didn't last in this tent more than a day or two. The Diego car tent is way better.
2,Very Cheaply made!,"This toy is very cute, but very cheaply made. My daughter recieved this as a x-mas present and within 20 minutes it was broken! (And she does not play very rough). Although she loves dora this toy will go back, not worth the money!"
2,I hide it from my daughter,"My 2 year old got this Dora tent for Christmas last year. I hide it on her all the time. She only plays with it for a few minutes unless she takes it out to sleep in. My daughter is only in the 50th percentile for weight and height and therefore is the average height for a 2 year old but when she wants to sleep in it, inevitably either her head or her feet stick out because the tent is too small or she ends up sleeping in an uncomfortable ball. I hate that there is no bottom but that is also the only way that air is let in unless you leave the door open which to her defeats the purpose altogether. She is very excited everytime she sees it but she quickly becomes frustrated with it falling down and not staying in one place."
2,HIDE AWAY THIS TOY!!,My 18 month old daughter loves Dora and was so excited when we brought home this new tent. I had to take it back! Not at all durable. Fliped over as soon as she entered the tent. It does not stand on its own. It's a hazard!...
3,My daughter really enjoys this tent,"I agree with all of the other reviews about this tent and its durability, however my daughter absolutely loves it. First the three plastic sticks that come with the tent to hold it open broke and warped pretty quick. I went to Home Depot and bought three wooden dowels for 79 cents each and cut them to the correct length and it works great. My daughter uses this mostly inside and it is fine, when outside the wind and everything else did move it around. I bought a 4 pack of plastic tent stakes from target for about $1 and put one in each corner to hold it in place, works great. I think we paid $19 for this at Target and it definitely seems worth the amount of enjoyment my daughter gets. If you are expecting a $200 high quality camping tent, you will probably be disappointed."
2,Lasted 1 day!,My daughter got this tent for her 4th birthday. I thought that she and her 2 year old brother would be able to play in it together...not quite! They didn't even fit in it together. One kid could barely fit into it. And the worst part is that it ripped the day after her party. The rip was not due to the kids being rough in it at all. It is just a very poorly made tent. Luckly the store let us return it and we got a much more sturdy tent in its place.
2,Too Pan Africanist,"Alven came to South Africa in 1986 to visit his paternal family, and I had an opportunity of meeting him. Some of the things he's mentioned are true, but illustrated from a pan africanist point. The advents are faced with the same challenges that face all eurocentric based churches.Alven would have done us fairness if he had looked at other cultural groups within the Seventh Day Adventist Church; like native americans, chinese and other people of colour."
1,Read the information CAREFULLY!!!!!,"This is NOT a tape about Johnny Cash!! It is a CD interview with him, along with a movie, the Pride of Jessie Hallam. I bought it thinking it was about Johnny. WRONG. I waited 6 weeks and paid 18 bucks for it, only to be disappointed! You have to read the info carefully to see that. Don't make the same mistake I did!"
4,"""Reading is Fundamental.""","The Pride of Jesse HallamDew ewe reed? Kan u reed? Johnny Cash plays an illiterate father in this drama. If you like Johnny and education and social issues and romance and decent acting, you owe it to yourself to experience this story. It provides great insight on the necessity of the ability to READ. I can't count the number of times I've urged friends and co-workers to view it. I mailed a copy to my younger son, who works with detainees in prison; many are there because of illiteracy issues and the social / cultural impoverishment resulting from illiteracy. I figured that they might feel a connection with the man Johnny plays; at least Johnny will keep their attention !! ""Enjoy the viewing, and celebrate YOUR ability to read !!"""
4,I want more!,"Steve Keshner has written an engrossing and, at times, gross book. I mean this in a positive sense. Some may be turned off by his ""no punches pulled"" approach. I found it a refreshing page turner. (""Just one more story before I close the book for the night"" type of reading experience.)With the current post-9/11 and Iraqi war situation there are many stories that are prescient. I just wish Mr. Kreshner would write at least one more book. I'm sure he has many more tales to tell. Reading his novel just like sitting with him at a party, having him recount his experiences and adventures.No one has mentioned the last section of the book with the photos of the reconstructed TWA 800. This, alone, cries out for another book!"
5,"INITIALLY, DISTRACTING... FINALLY, BRILLIANT!","At first I was annoyed by the terrible editing job, the seemingly unrelated stories, the disjointed nature of the narrative... Then, it became clear that I was living a life, time was passing, the author's style was growing, and I was fascinated... I have discovered the precious pearl in the sloppy mess of an oyster. Keshner is a brilliant story teller, a flawed human being, and I will read the book over and over again."
5,THIS RABBI IS DESTINY'S CHILD... GREAT BOOK!,"Some reviewers call it drivel, or ""sophomoric"" (whatever that's supposed to mean) at Keshner, yet COCKPIT CONFESSIONS has everything for me. An absolute perfect mix of flying stories, travel, coming of age, angst, sex, and political incorrectness (incorrectitude?).The book keeps calling me back, and I find that I can open it anywhere, begin reading, and always seem to enjoy something new / exciting. The one thing I can say with certainty is that the book is REAL. We get the true grit of reality, and find that pilots are real people, with real libidos, and real neuroses.The only change I want is MORE."
3,Overall not bad,"I found the book very funny at times and very disgusting at times. The book is well writen for the most part, but I found the book to be Unnecessarily vulgar. At times the auther seams to put valgarady in stories just to have it in the book. If you can get over that part of the book, it is very enjoyable to read."
5,"OUTRAGEOUS, RAW, MESSY, YET BRILLIANT","I MADE THE MISTAKE OF TAKING A PILOT FRIEND OF MINE'S ADVISE AND BOUGHT ""COCKPIT CONFESSIONS.""IT HAS BEEN A MISTAKE, 'CAUSE NOW I CAN'T STOP RE-READING IT. EVERY TIME I PICK IT UP I FIND SOMETHING NEW TO CHEW ON.THE FLYING STORIES ARE GREAT, THE TRAVEL IS TO DIE FOR, AND THE WRITING BRINGS YOU RIGHT INTO THE HEAD OF KESHNER, ONE BRILLIAN TWISTED-SISTER!ARABS BEWARE, HE DUMPS ALL OVER YOU."
1,"Overall, a horrible, OFFENSIVE read!!!","My recommendation, stay far away from this book, and certainly don't waste your hard earned money to purchase it. Being somewhat of a commercial aviation buff and possessing a profound respect for the personnel who make up the airlines, I expected to find a book which would reinforce my feelings along that line. Imagine my surprise and horror when among the book's pages I found nothing but the worst kind of smut, harsh language and hardly anything to do with the airline industry at all - the subject matter is vulgar and disappointing for those who were looking for a good aviation read. Beware!!!"
2,Keshner's Confessions,"Keshner is an excellent storyteller. I imagine he is the life of any party. His stories about cross-cultural experiences are funny and sad, showing both the brokenness and the goodness of humankind. These stories represent the book's value.If you embrace irreverence, then Keshner's attitudes toward women, Arabs, homosexuals and authority may strike you as funny.My primary disappointment with the book is the author's ongoing sophomoric fixation with female body parts. Also, his tell all approach will not enhance the public's confidence in the cockpit."
1,Cockpit Confessions of an Airline Pilot,"While this book may have received rave reviews from some, I could not get beyond page 3 because of the author's use of gutter language. I heard more than enough of that kind of talk while in the military service and other places. I don't care to read it. I returned the book even though it cost me the return postage. The other option was to just discard it.Poor taste and poor judgement, Mr Keshner. I doubt if airline pilots talk as you write. I have been a flight instructor for 40 years and the pilots I associate with, including airline crews, do not talk that way.Please re-write a ""G"" book to replace the ""PG-13"" or ""R""."
2,Colorful story telling mixed with half truths,"Author Keshner is more concerned with telling amusing stories and making himself out to be this ""bad boy"" irreverant aviator than writing a factual book. I too worked, and still do, for one of the major airlines he writes about and actually know many of the pilots he includes in his stories. Although Keshner spins some interesting yarns, his stories are clearly more fantasy than reality. He also has a crudeness to his writing that I didn't find amusing, entertaining or funny. The airline business is full of fun and amusing stories, I just didn't find Keshner's very amusing or believable. Save your money and look elsewhere for your airline stories."
4,"Fun, Frightening and Sad...","Some of the other reviewers are pretty brutal withKeshner's book. Come on, lighten up a little! Thestories are alternately funny, sad, shocking or justchilling. Pilots are exposed as being just as messedup or more than the general population. Very un-PC,there is something here to offend everyone,especially Arabs.On the surface, Keshner seems to be morally ambiguous,emotionally detached (comatose?) and perhaps a littleintellectually dishonest. I detect however, a basically decentman forced to play a lot of games just so he can pursue thelove of his life, flying.One star deducted for being (apparently) self-edited andproofread. Its OK to be self-published (if in fact it is),but no offense, use pros next time... Still, this book is a little diamond in the rough."
1,Don't contribute cash to this drivel,"I enjoy traveling. I like reading Salon.com's ""Ask the Pilot"" and thought I'd get some more interesting reading from this book -- didn't happen. This poorly written, poorly edited, racist book includes for your enjoyment a conspiricy theory. Apparently meant to be taken seriously.Don't waste your money."
5,WHERE DID THIS GUY COME FROM? WOW!,I LOVE AVIATION; I LOVE TRAVEL; I LOVE CALLING A SPADE A SPADE; I HATE POLITICAL CORRECTNESS; I HATE ARABS; I REALLY HATE SAUDIS.#### THIS BOOK IS EVERYTHING I WANT AND LOVE ####HOW DO I SEND THIS KESHNER A MEMBERSHIP TO MY PERSONAL CLUB? A COHIBA?
2,Trashy but interesting . . .,"As the title of my review suggest, the language is blunt often bordering offensive. However it is a pretty good read. Gives you an insight into charter operations with some hilarious stories (particularly the incident in Saudi Arabia).Not alot of relevance to regular scheduled aviation but filled with insider jokes, tricks and puns.Although there are a lot of typos, it is an easy read."
3,Tawdry Flying Tales,"I read this with great eagerness, as I've flown wide-bodied aircraft on international flights, like the author. He writes from a cynical, yet sometimes humorous perspective and really invites the public into his world, flying for a charter airline. His story is genuine, and he tells it with occasional enthusiasm and constant sarcasm. It is an interesting read, but may turn off some with his profanity, bathroom humor and locker-room anecdotes. It jumps around a bit, and lacks continuity, but is an accurate portrayal of flying 747s for a charter airline around the world. Rated ""M"" for mature audiences."
1,Badly unbalanced,"Knightley's book, while interesting in places, is very much a ""child of its time"": he uncritically repeats many of the more shrill and naive arguments made by the Left against intelligence services in the 1970s. If you already believe that intelligence agencies are a complete waste of time and money, you'll love this book. If you'd like a mature discussion of the merits, demerits and dilemmas of intelligence work in the real world, look elsewhere."
3,Not much help for Vegetarians,"I bought this book partly because I know that Turkish food features a lot of meat, and I'll be visiting with my wife who is a vegetarian. Can you believe that a book that is *ALL* about food, does not even mention vegetarianism, nor when they list ""handy phrases for restaurants"" do they list any phrases that deal with the topic? For that matter, they don't deal with any topic having to deal with food allergies, being on a diet, etc. Essentially this is a book about helping people make smart choices when eating in Turkey, but the only people they want to help are people who will eat anything. I should have saved my money."
4,College Student ethics,This book has a variety of important case studies dealing with issues that confront the average college student. These case studies are good at generating discussion and getting at moral and ethical intuitions of undergraduate students. The book is clearly written and a useful supplementary text to courses in contemporary moral issues interested in dealing with issues other than those that are stereotypically dealt with in such courses.
5,A book every American must read,"The United States is facing a potential financial collapse. For example, did you know that . . .If interest rates rise to the double-digit levels of the Carter administration, payments on our current national debt will consume every single tax dollar the government collects.Or . . .That foreigners now hold nearly 40 percent of all U.S. treasury securities, making us completely dependent on other nations to keep us afloat.Every American should read this insightful, lucid, and well-written book and join in the fight to stop Washington's reckless ways and save our country from bankruptcy!"
4,The book was pretty good,We had to read this book for english class.My favorite part was when Ulysses reunited with his family and lived happily ever after.Other favorite parts included when Ulysses stabed the one eyed cyclops Polyphemus in his only eye.The book was not so super great though because there could have been more action scenes.Overall though it was an ok book.
5,An adventurous and exciting book,"The book ""The Adventures of Ulysses"" was a very entertaining book about a man named Ulysses. Ulysses who was the the king of Ithaca, went on a journey to take over the city Troy. On their way back from the city they got thrown off course. That was just the beginning of their 20 year adventure. The book was a break from the usual class assignments to read boring books and short stories. It was very exiting and entertaining."
2,It was bad!,It was sort of exciting at some points in the book. And at other points it was very very very very very boring.
1,It was about a man named Ulysses who went on a journey.,"Ulysses was a courageous man who lead a journey of three ships and many men. He encountered strange creatures, demigods and people who helped and harmed him. We disliked most of this book because it was hard to follow, some parts were too long and boring, and it was a little repetitive. We don't recommend this book to anyone who doesn't enjoy Greek adventures."
1,No product,"My product never arrived. I tried to contact the seller, but they did not reply. May I please get a refund?Thanks,Mariniah"
1,WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ,"it was just bland and boring, thats all, the plot was ok, but not worth reading. the only reason i'd buy is so that i could use it for scrap paper, or maybe for oragami. otehr than that, its honestly useless."
1,this book sucks,Im too old to read this book. I had to read it for my 12th grade english honors class for a side project. Some of it was ok but most of it was really boring and immature. This guy Ulysses and his men ran from all the monsters when they were suppost to be these great war heroes. I think they werent very brave running all the time. If i was them i would have atleast tried to fight and kill the monsters. I would not recommend this book to anyone my age or under 12. The old literature bored me to death that i didnt want to read anymore of it.i feel bad for anyone who has to read it. (...)save your time and dont read this.
5,A Must Read For Children,"I read this book in the 3rd or 4th grade and absolutely loved it. It sparked a lifelong interest in history, religions, politics, literature, you name it. It successfully takes The Odyssey, one of the classic works of Western literature, and turns into an extremely readable adventure story. For a teacher or a parent, this is a good way to introduce your kid to history and ancient Greek mythology and culture. This is a must read for all upper elementary school and middle school students."
3,the book was good but not the best one we've ever read.,"The book was interesting but it gets kind of confusing towards the middle.If you are the kind of person who can't stay focused on a book, this is not the one for you.But if you like,adventure,and action this is a good book that you'll probably enjoy.The many places and people that are in the story can sometimes make it hard to follow.Otherwise, this book was enjoyable."
5,Great Book!,"I started this book a few days after reading a re-telling of the Trojan war, which was written by the same author as the adventures of ulysses. This book was just as good!!!!! I Think that Bernard Evslin did a great job re-telling the story of the odyssey. 5 STARS!!!!"
1,You might get what you pay for,"The first one I received reeked of the finishing product that was used and was not straight. When held in the proper manner, the suburito curved to the left about 5 degrees. I contacted the seller and was shipped a replacement. The replacement suffered from the same curve but to a lesser degree. I have given up on this seller and will order from a more reputable martial arts supplier."
3,Correct transition CD,"Well, this was the first CD after his great trilogy (""Reggae Resistencia"", ""Reconcavo Identificado"" and the great ""Campo de Batalha"") and it appears that Edson are looking a refresh of his style. This CD have great songs (""Isaac"", ""Fato Consumado"", ""Meus direitos"") btu it's not so good as previous releases."
5,I really only bought it for the Ice cream Man,I recived it in regular shipping Brand new wrapped in plastic Opened it the Ice cream man Is A nice Looking disk cause it looks like the front cover I dont like the disk that are just silver or double sided Like jack frost 2 and killer tongue are. But for the price I payed which seems to always be changing on this site I only payed like a dollar more I was like well Get ice cream man or spend an extra buck and get two more movies . So I spent the extra buck everything came brand new . I don't have a lot of time to always sit down view my movies right away. I have family and a normal life. But as I can tell I'm pretty sure everything be Dvd quality. So I'm pretty sure there won't be any complaints . But Jack frost was hard to find the first one. Because its out of print atleast what they said But I found it on two sites One I had to get it imported for like 14 bucks or pay 12 bucks and get it a dvd transfer copy ..
4,Great little chair,"Very cute chair. Sturdy, good price, and an added plus is the umbrella. My 16 month old loves to sit in it, just like a grownup. Also has a little storage pouch. Easy to fold up, though I think I remember it being a little tricky to open and close the umbrella. We got it at the end of the season, so we only used it 3-4 times. After researching in the stores and online, this was the best for the money."
3,I probably would not purchase this item again,"Although the product is super cute there are a few issues with it. When the umbrella is up like it is in the picutre, it does not stay in place, it always seems to fall backwards. Also, the weight of the umbrella makes the chair tip backwards easily, obviously if no one is sitting in it."
3,"Don't use anywhere but the beach, it tips over easily.",We like this chair OK but it tips right over when my 16 month climbs into it so I would only recommend it somewhere that will result in a soft landing (like the beach). It's worth about [...] if you ask me.
4,Little Boy Loves It,Its a perfect little toddler size beach chair and my little boy sat it the entire time we were at the beach.
2,Too small,"Chairs were adorable and well made. However, my grandchildren are two and three and they were too small and would not have last but this summer for them. If your children are petite and under 30 lbs they would be fine."
3,Very cute but light,"It is very cute. My daughter loved sitting in it at the beach. However, like the other reviewers said, it is very light and easily tippy especially with the umbrella up. We had to anchor it in the sand or just not put the umbrella up until she was sitting in it."
2,Disappointed,"I bought 2 of these chairs for my grandkids. One blue and one pink. The chairs are much smaller than I imagined. The pink one had a seam coming apart on the seat and the umbrella wouldnt stay up so I returned it. The blue one has been used by my 19 month old grandson and it is pretty tippy. I am always watching him so he doesnt tip over backwards in it. It is lightweight and the wind often blows it over. Sorry I bought it. There are better, safer products out there for less money."
1,Very slow response,This was a wasted order for us. Because it was a book for a two week course which the supplier took two weeks to send. Why would it take two weeks to send a small book within the US in two weeks. We could not use it. The package is sitting in the house un opened. I am very disappointed .S. Meer
3,"It really was about lots of ""junk""","I bought it then wanted to return it, but didn't. It gave me alot of ideas for garage sale hunting, but the items were really not appealing to me, and i think its written more for martha stewart types. Sorry but I like my stuff a little newer."
2,"Well, the title is on to something...","I was disappointed in this book. I thought it would be more interesting, but really it doesn't give any good tips and pretty much restates common knowledge. If you're new to garage-saling then I would recommend this book."
5,Calling All Packrats,"This book is a must for all pack rats, hoarders and collectors. Each page is packed with photos of collectable treasures that will make you drool. It will stir up all of your shopping genes!"
3,"Great Pictures, Few Ideas","This book was great on pictures--pictures that showed the ""after"" of transforming junk. The book, though, lack information on exactly to transfer that junk. It did not get down to the ""down and dirty."" I have seen better information given on the television show, Decorating Cents, on HGTV.If you like pictures and use them in your transformation, this is the book for you. If you want detailed instructions, there are other well-informative books that can do a better job."
2,"Not very instructional for"" transforming' junk","I ordered this book and then returned it. I did not find it very helpful at all as far as restoration goes. I have read many many books on flea markets, garage sale finds. This book truly was about' junk'. If you like gaudy kitchy stuff you may like it, but to me it was all about clutter (and not interesting clutter either). it did have many places listed to find junk at, though. But then again you can find those in the paper and the yellow pages. i do not recommend this book."
1,"Glad this was on tv, when i saw it!","This movie is just stupid, don't waste your money on this! Poor Gore and poor make up and stupid acting! Just glad i never bought it. Not even worth renting!"
1,Dull and predictable,"I watched the whole thing. I kept waiting for something entertaining to happen, but it didn't. The trailers were much better than the actual movie. Don't bother watching, let alone buying."
5,Excellent product,"The book is exactly what I needed to both begin and move onto more advanced work in clicker training as my dog and I are ""crossovers"". It gives great explanations about the theory behind this method and easy to understand practical steps to achieving the desired outcome. The book was second hand and in the condition the seller promised so I was also happy with that, and with the speed it reached me."
2,Not for beginners!!!,This book was way too technical for me. All I wanted was book that gave me the basics of clicker training and a how to guide for very simple tasks. This is definitely not for the beginner or nonprofessional.
4,Not sure what to make......,"This isnt really what i was expecting. Still, its an awesome album. Just needs to be given time. Personally i prefer Amen, and Casey's the only reason i bought this. But thats not to say if you like Amen you wont like this."
1,No honor for amazon.com to recommend this for IPAQ 1935,"Very misleading. I bought this together with my ipaq 1935. In the end, I found this bag is not for my PDA. SInce it is too cheap, I did not even bother to return it to amazon.com and let it collect dust in a corner at my home.Amazon.com should modify its recommendation."
1,Useless for 1945,"I bought it as it said it was compatible with all Ipaq and says that on the packaging too. It is way too big for a 1945. Slots etc are covered up, and it's just about useless. It has a belt clip which isn't listed on the Amazon page, either, and is bigger and bulkier than expected."
1,iConcepts case for ipaq,"This case is large and bulky, and completely takes the iPaq out of the realm of a shirt pocket pc. It states on the packaging that it is a belt clip case, which wasn't mentioned in the add at Amazon.com. Completely unsuitable for my uses."
3,Question?,"Would this product fit an iPaq 1910? If not, which one would?Please let me know so I can proceed with my purchases.Regards,Zanony"
3,A Shade Shady (Now Prance) - RuPaul,"US CD Maxi Single Track Listing for -""A SHADE SHADY (NOW PRANCE)"" - RUPAUL1) LP Version - 3:562) DJ Pierre Club Mix - 7:483) 12"" Version - 6:184) Back To My Roots (Secchi's Extended Mix) - 7:005) Wild Pitch Mix - 7:496) Alternate Mix - 5:$81993"
1,Not what I expected,This product is more useful to a higher level age group. Teaching 1st grade I was hoping for more template posters.
4,Good for BYOB events,"I like these for picnics and casual parties. They are cute, work fine and are washable. Also inexpensive, so it isn't a big deal if I leave it somewhere. Makes a cute gift paired with a matching wine tote. Just be careful not to hold the drip collar while pouring, or the bottle could slip."
2,A Tragic American Tale,"An American Tragedy is a lengthy book in which Dreiser refuses to leave out any detail. Although the underlying plot is intersting and suspenseful Dreiser manages to dull the story with lengthy descriptions. When one reads this book they are brought on the roller coaster of the contempelations of good and evil, fun and dull that Clyde Griffths, the main character, goes through. Dreiser also uses foreshadowing as a repetitive literary device. After the first of the three books, the reader feels as though they know what will happen through the many obvious forshadows. While I realize that this book is considered a book of good merit, I feel that after the fifth-hundred page I was ready to put the book to rest forever."
5,Great,"This is a great novel. Dreiser has been knocked by critics as a clumsy writer whose over-all impact is brilliant. Sort of the Rolling Stones of literature. But I found the novel not only brilliant, but I did not find the writing at all clumsy. I kept waiting to frown at a sentence's construction. But I thought EVERYTHING about this book was great, including the word-for-word writing."
2,Men in White,"Compare this to The Bonfire of the Vanities, another attempt to illustrate twentieth century US society through the hubris and public humiliation of one man. Do we want to spend the majority of the book on the formative years of the protagonist and his victim? Wolfe wisely placed the crime just one hundred pages into his seven hundred page book. Dreiser, by contrast, gives us five hundred pages of back story before starting the real drama, which focuses all the characters and institutions - - courts, politics, newspapers, business, church - - on Clyde Griffiths. The characters are real enough, the societal critique valid enough, but, for large parts, the delivery is about as subtle and engaging as that of Clyde's street preacher parents."
2,"An American Tragedy was a great disappointment as I was looking forward to reading it, but it was slow and boring.",I never even finished the book which is very unusual for me. It just didn't hold my attention as many times as I went back to it.
4,An American Classic,"Yes, the book does drag a bit (I admit almost falling asleep during some parts) but altogether, ""An American Tragedy"" is still one of the classic novels of literature. Besides the obvious plot, it is a story about our destinies. Dreiser shows us that after millions of years of evolution, we are still only humans, capable of devastating failure."
4,Timeless and timely,"Classics can be such drudgery, but this one rarely fell into that category. The premise is very good: poor boy grows up wanting to be rich. poor boy starts working for rich uncle. poor boy falls in love with poor factory girl. poor boy also fa...lls in love with rich girl and start moving in high society circles. poor boy gets poor girl pregnant. poor boy decides to kill poor girl so he can be with rich girl. And on and on. The hardest part to read was the dialogue. Apparently the most used word in the 1920's was ""Gee"". Other than that, it was so very good. I was repulsed by the main character, Clyde. I also felt sorry for him. Dreiser captured perfectly the class struggle in America. It doesn't seem much different today than in 1925 when this was published. So many of us seem to be clawing our way somewhere. It brings to mind something my college professor said to me, ""When you're climbing the corporate/social ladder, remember you're always looking up at the next a-hole."""
5,Dreiser's classic is a timely masterpiece,"It took me all of eight months to slog through this novel, but it was well worth the time investment. Dreiser's passionate humanism shines through a grim tale of a naif who has bought into the American ideal of wealth and status - and how those aspirations become his undoing. The theme is apropos in our materialistic times. Drieser is often criticized for awkward writing, but any novel that makes me think and feel so deeply about our culture and its values is a masterpiece in my book"
5,An American Tragedy!,One of the greatest novels of all time - I lived near the place where the murder occurred - which was tried in our Herkimer County Courthouse. I usually go up there every summer..!:)) GREAT STORY!
3,Driesler's Language a Word Apart,"Good historical material both in subject and style of writing. However, the author fails to say in a simple sentence what can be said in very verbose and complex one. Now I know why I didn't finish it when I was in High School.I am much more patient now."
5,An enduring classic,"How does one review a classic? With respect of course. This is a classic tragedy. A flawed character is doomed, yet has our sympathy because we recognize his weakness as our own even while we deny it. Here are all the elements of tragedy in a modern setting. Oh the idiot! Why can't he see?We know how it is bound to end, but we must read on to be sure."
2,Poor Kindle version,"My review comments are primarily about the electronic transfer of this novel. There are no paragraph indents, many misspellings, and overall poor copy editing, particularly near the end.Regarding the novel itself, I can only imagine what this story would have been like in the hands of a more competent writer. It is a testament to the fundamental bones of this story that, in spite of Dreiser's almost singular heavy-handedness, the moral elements shine through the leadenness of Dreiser's language. No doubt shocking in its day, the contemporary reader cannot help but think, ""get on with it already,"" but Dreiser doesn't get on."
4,"American Society, Dissected","This novel provides an engrossing view of American society in the early 1900s by following the partial rise and complete downfall of Clive Griffiths. The examination of Griffiths's life offers comments on poverty, wealth, religion, politics and morality. Griffiths is truly a flawed hero, and the reader will have trouble finding sympathy for him despite his deprived background. His greatest sin is that he is never satisfied; he always wants more. In the end he discovers that ""more"" comes at great cost to himself and those who care for him."
2,"yellowed and musty, not new","I have ordered many used and new books from Amazon. This book, from Alibris, was supposed to be in ""new to very good"" condition. Instead, it came with yellowed, musty smelling pages. I would not order another book from Alibris."
2,black tea with flowers,"This was a surprise. I ordered Prince of Wales, which is usually a black tea and received a black tea with flowers and leaves in it. When brewed it had a distinctively floral taste. Not good for a breakfast tea. I would like to have known that the specks of color in the picture were flowers and leaves."
1,Kindle version is an insult,"Whitehead is a genius, and the Kindle version that I bought is an insult to him and anyone who reads. There were typographical errors on nearly every page. Don't buy it. I hope this isn't what is to be expected of e-publishing."
1,No support from iConcepts SAKAR website,"I used this a few times, and then I upgraded the OS and had to load the drivers back on the Pocket PC. Unfortunately, I lost the disk and Sakars's website has no driver downloads for this device. So this device is useless. If anyone has the driver files which came on the disk, can you please email them to me at rachtenb@bellsouth.net.Thanks,"
2,Finicky Thumboard,"To enable the thumboard to work you must load the software to your PC and then sync. The problem I have is that I travel and periodically have to reboot the IPAQ which causes the software to be dumped from memory. Like one of the previous complaints, since iConcepts isn't ""web friendly"" I can't download the software so I must wait until I return home to reload...pain."
1,Produced by a non-existent company?!,"It says on the box that this product is produced by iConcepts, a branch of Sakar International. Neither of these names are googlable. There is no help no help number or website on the box. The only piece of information I can find on them after intensive search is an address in Edison, NJ.Their obscurity wouldn't be a problem if their product actually worked, but when I plug it into my IPAQ H3800 running WinCE 3.0, it does nothing. If anyone knows any tricks to get this to work, please post it. Another major shortcoming is that it doesn't fit around an expansion pack."
5,A fun toy to play with,My daughter got this toy for her 3rd birthday and she still loves it. Betty's hair lights up in pink and blue. She loves to dress her in different shoes and clothes. The only thing we have trouble with is putting the sunglasses on. I would recommend that you get a box to store all the parts. Also remember to always remove Betty's head from her body so that the batteries don't wear out.
2,"Slow developing, lacks surprises","I had high hopes for this book based off the reviews but after getting in about 100 pages I was still waiting for it to get interesting. It's a fairly fast read but I was left wanting more. There's no real mystery to where the story is going; the author tries to add in some drama but it really doesn't come off very well. By the end I just wanted it to be over, it just couldn't hold my attention because the story was so bland."
3,If You Are interested in Caravaggio or Art History/scholarship,"If You Are interested in Caravaggio or Art History/Scholarshipthink You will enjoy this and find it an interesting read.Having said that,feel that it was awfully slow to go anywhere,neverless the author did a good job regarding research onsubject."
3,Good Read / Clunky Writing,This was an enjoyable read. It opens a window onto a subculture (art historians /researchers) which you don't hear about every day. As I started to read this I couldn't figure out if this was a novel or non-fiction. It doesn't say which one of those it exactly is! Was this a calculated ploy on the part of the publisher to garner interest from the author's fiction audience? Reading this as a novel I found the writing to be sub par As non-fiction I felt that the author could've told the story better. In both instances this book would've been better served if it was spiced up with a bit more drama. All in all I still recommend this to all people who love to read.
3,Must read in between lines...,"Not knowing much about the author or Caravaggio I opened this book with little expectation. The Authors' attempt at creating a dramatic storyline about the people involved became distracting. The story loses its' focus and becomes wrapped up in a mild soap opera. However, there is interesting information about the process of restoring canvas art and the art world itself. Do not look to this book for detailed information about Caravaggio. I did enjoy it, but felt it was filled with unecessary tangents."
3,A great story suffering from at times poor writing,"This is definitely one of the great stories of art history and it could be ""Da Vinci Code"" class if only the writing was better. The author mostly sticks to very short, tabloid-paper style sentences and never really weaves words into longer and more literary phrases."
4,Very Interesting Read,"The best parts of The Lost Painting: The Quest for a Caravaggio Masterpiece,by Jonathan Harr, deal with the artist himself. When most artists are considered eccentric, Caravaggio was a renegade in his actions. A fighter. He killed a man, and lived his last years on the run. Many of his paintings were initially discounted, but his popularity grew in later years. I enjoyed the book, and found the idea of these lost masterpieces, valued in the tens of millions of dollars, to be out there somewhere very fascinating.Four stars & recommended."
3,interesting and mysterious,"I love historical fiction and this book was just marvelous. Mr. Harr does an excellent job of describing the landscapes of Italy and Great Britain, plus he seemelessly weaves art history instruction into the story. A must read for art fans!"
2,I got a headache,"This was an assignment for a book club of which I am a member. I have never read a book about art and art history and so thought it might be interesting but, unless you are somewhat fluent in Italian and just love wordy prose you may want to pass on this volume.Below are the things, people and places introduced within just the first ten pages:Names of people and things: Sir Denis, Signore Mahon, Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, Roberto Longhi, Guercino, Guido Reni, Carracci, Domenichino, Doria Pamphili, Carlo Pietrangeli, Francesca Cappelletti, Giampaolo Correale & PiaggioNames of places: Da Fortunato, Cadogan Square, Archivio di Stato, Capitoline Gallery, Via del Portico d'Ottavia, Palazzo Senatorio, Bibliotheca Hertaiana, Via Gregoriana, Piazza Navona, Tita dei Monte, Villa Medici, Via Fracassini, Piazza del Popolo & Istituto Centrale per il RestauroNew names are added continually throughout the book, but if you can easily pronounce them - go for it! I got a headache."
3,entertaining,"This is a reasonably satisfying story of the discovery of a long lost masterpiece. It touches many subjects: Caravaggio's tempestuous life, the business of painting in 15-16C Rome, patronage, the 18C grand tour, the fortunes of ownership, mistaken attributions, interpretive scholarship, academia, the museum world, the art of restoration, etc.This is an agreeable, entertaining work. Art enthusiasts may be slightly disappointed with the brevity (and incomplete late provenance), but the author skillfully provides a glimpse into a less celebrated world. Though not a sequel to `A Civil Action,' it's enjoyable and worth reading.Highly recommended works on similar subjects: Thomas Hoving's `King of the Confessors' (the tale of the Bury St. Edmunds Cross) and `Tutankhamun: The Untold Story' (the discovery of Tut's tomb)."
2,Expected more,"There were several flaws with this book.1) I am an amateur artist and have read quite a bit about art, and I found the book to be dull.2) More than 1/2 the book is about Francesca and Laura. They did not find the painting and the descriptions of their personal lives are not interesting.3) It would make an interesting article but it doesn't have enough meat for a book.4) The first and 2nd halves of the book were only tenuously related to each other.I kept waiting for something to happen but nothing did."
4,The Carvaggio Code,"Loosely threading an Art student's pursuit of a lost Carvaggio painting, along with restorer who might have found a treasure beyond his wildest dreams, Harr manages to create a suspenseful narrative that will have you turning the pages for the masterpiece to be uncovered. The book is interspersed with biographical blips of Carvaggio's turbulant life, but little is spent on the details of his painting, instead Harr sets out to detail a timeline to find the missing piece. The ""quest"" is what it's all about, and it's a fun journey he takes you on."
5,A Great Read,"The Lost Painting will be a pure pleasure for anyone who enjoys a well written mystery, travelogue or historical novel. Mr. Harr's latest book combines all of the best elements of these genres into a fast paced and entertaining story which has the added fascinating dimension of describing actual events. I'll leave it to other, more skilled reviewers to outline the story line of the book. However, I would like to say that I read the entire book in one sitting and enjoyed every minute of the read. The author's vivid descriptions of Rome and it's neighborhoods, his insights into the life of Caravaggio and his superbly crafted portraits of the central characters made this book unfold like a well directed and photographed movie. My only caution for folks interested in reading this book is to make sure you have time to finish it when you start. I don't believe you'll want to put it down after you begin."
2,"Should have been good, but it wasn't.","This was a disappointment. The hunt for a lost Caravaggio, the digging about in archives, the scientific test to see ""is it really?"", should be fascinating. But it's not. And I cannot stand non-fiction writers who think they have to make their books read like fiction. Where is the critical analysis? Where is the index? Where are the footnotes? Non-fiction needs references. You cannot expect me to believe what you are writing unless you tell me where you got the information. A bibliography and acknowledgements don't cut it.I'm seeing this more and more in non-fiction and it drives me right up the wall.And who the heck had the idea of publishing a book about a Caravaggio painting with NO, I repeat NO, illustrations?"
2,"Great story, but not much of a book","As a photographer and great admirer of Michelangelo Merisi di Caravaggio's mastery of light, I was eager to plow through Jonathan Harr's book ""The Lost Painting."" And to be sure, there is something here. Just maybe not enough for a book length. The core story is interesting, but the book itself isn't.Walking down cob-web stone steps by candle light is all well and good, but it feels as if Harr used over descriptive language and really stretched the word count to accommodate publication. The book needed a deeper parallel story accompanying the search for The Taking of Christ, one we don't find in this book. I think after reading the dust jacket, you'll probably get most of the story than reading the whole book.This is a great five page article for the New Yorker, but this is by no means worth the word count in the book."
4,The Search for a Lost Masterpiece,This is a page-turning account of a search for a real Caravaggio painting that has been missing for hundreds of years.The search starts in Italy with an art historian and two graduate students. It continues to other countries and the suspense builds. What is the painting's history? Who owned it last? Is it still in existence.I enjoyed this book very much.
2,Painfully Slow,"The plot is about the paintstaking process researches go through to find a lost painting and the pace of this book is just as painfully slow. I finished it, but had to force myself to just keep reading. It reads like a novel, but it is a true story of researchers looking for a lost painting, the search requires, careful attention to detail, hours posting through the dead scrolls of family archives, if this sounds exciting to you, then go for it....don't be fooled by the back of the jacket or the reviews, you really don't learn anything about the artist, other than the fact his life wasn't that exciting, the lives of his researchers aren't that exciting."
3,Pretty Good Read,"Not bad for a quick read. Overall this book was full of really interesting information, and a cool story, but it seemed to lack any flow or artistry. More just a retelling of a news story.Regardless, it was very interesting, and not a bad read."
5,Excellent,"Mr. Harr has produced a well-documented and ultimately readable book on a facinating topic. He reveals the culture and the turf wars that exist in the art community. He reveals the participants unsympathetically, revealing their faults alongside their brilliance. Excellent read, and highly recommended."
1,"Aaahh, disappointing....","I have been interested in htis story since the early 90s when I read about it in an article in the NYTimes...I was thrilled to see a book on such a fascinating subject...so, you can imagine my disappointment at this boring, un-inspirational book, on a topic so full of potential. for a tome that refers constantly to the ""obsession"" that so many scholars and historiains have for Caravaggio, the book is dull, clumsy and bereft of either passion or obsession. I found the characters conveniently drawn, two dimensional and in general, forgettable. I have much stronger memories of that littel 2 page report form over 10 years ago...Having just finished the MARVELOUS Matisse biographies (by Hilary Spurling), and an obsessive reader of books about artists....I suggeswt passing on tis one..."
3,Spoiled by A Civil Action,"When a book rocks your reading world like A Civil Action did -- renders you unable to put it down whether dinner is burning or your train is arriving at your stop -- it is unavoidable to expect, nay hope, that the author's next book will do the same.I was slightly disappointed with The Lost Painting, if only because it did not do the same. I wanted an escape from graduate school reading over the holiday, and found it. Yet I didn't have the same burning desire to tear through this that I did with A Civil Action.Harr does extremely well at making fact read like fiction yet I felt this was a bit fluffy. The story is intriguing and we learn a bit about Caravaggio, restoration, the cut-throat world of art collecting and the hunt for lost paintings. I definitely recommend this book but suggest you temper expectations if you're expecting a page turner like its predecessor!"
4,didn't love it but liked it a lot,"I bought this book because it was listed on a few major lists of best books of 2005 and the subject matter appealed to me. It turned out to be a fast-paced book, overall fun to read and offered a nice blend of a mini-bio of Caravaggio, the world of art-restoration and the hunt for the painting. While none of the above were in-depth studies and the book is far from the epic it could have been, I had no complaints. I would recommend this book for being well-written (I thought) and having fascinating subject matter."
3,Interesting - but unnecessarily long,"It is an interesting story, but as others have noted, the writing and story line are just fair. I agree with others that the interest in Francesca Cappelletti's romantic relationship feels misplaced - or at least over indulged. While the archival study of Francesca and Laura Testa is interesting and important, the recognition of the painting by Sergio Benedetti seems disappointingly 'sottomesso'... I also felt that the expression often attributed to Correale (""cosa tremenda"" or ""che tremenda"") felt misunderstood - the Italian expression would not translate to 'Tremendous!' or 'Incredible!', but rather 'How awful!' or 'How terrible!', but perhaps I didn't understand the author's intentions in these bits...For me, a long article - stripped of the 'fictional' feel - would ultimately have been more satisfying - especially if accompanied by good reproductions of the paintings discussed."
3,"This book should be called ""The Mom's Idea Book.""","Through my reading of this book I found many helpful tips on things to do w/ my kids. However, I purchased this book thinking it would center more around the ""Christian"" part of the title. It doesn't. This is a book for any mom but it fails to address many spriitual issues facing the christian mom."
1,LITE Christian idea book,"I bought this book, despite the negative reviews, and I was disappointed. I thought perhaps the negative reviewers were being too critical, but this really is for LITE Christians.If you are looking for sound biblical advice, this book is not for you.If you are looking for in-depth insight into biblical motherhood, this is not for you.If you are looking for specifically detailed advice, this is not for you.If you are a homeschooling mom, this is not for you.If your faith in Christ is THE CENTER of your life, from which all else flows, this book is not for you.HOWEVER, if your faith is just a PART of your life, your children attend schools, you may or may not be a working mom, you may or may not read the Bible, you might find some insight in this book.I understand that this is supposed to spark some ideas, but the ""ideas"" in here are nothing new, not detailed, and not deep."
3,Helpful and Handy!,"Ellen Banks Elwell wrote The Christian Mom's Idea Book to have hundreds of tips and suggestions from moms in one place. The book is broken into small chapters covering a wide range of topics from Birthday Parties to The Doctor's Office to Laundry and Organization. She suggests that her readers may want to skip to sections that interest them the most instead of reading the book from cover to cover. She has interviewed moms that she knows as well as some professionals.What I really appreciate about this type of book is that it is available when I need it. I have a few of them sitting on a shelf and when I find myself wondering what to do about a problem, I can open a few books and glean from others. Elwell covers a huge range of topics and many of her suggestions are very helpful. She has a very open attitude and understands that not all of her tips will help every mother out there. This book is very reader friendly."
2,Americans Are So Full Of Themselves!,"Americans are so full of themselves! It's always all about them, and never about the people whose lives they destroy.Three million Viet Namese died during the US occupation and aggression in Viet Nam. The illegal US bombing of Cambodia killed another 500,000 people, and an additional three million people died at the hands of the Khmer Rouge, who were supplied and supported by the US government.Yet all the Ameicans ever talk about or care about are the 57,000 US troops that died in Viet Nam. The US troops were the aggressors in Viet Nam, and they were carrying out genocide against the Viet Namese people. I never felt any sympathy for the US troops at all, and I do not respect those who do."
2,Not my cup of tea,"My review will be of little use to you, as I cannot tell you why I disliked the book so much, except that I had to force myself to read two-thirds of it, and had to stop because it was boring. There were a few clever bits in these tales, but it was not enough for me. I think I understood most or all of it, but it was just not interesting enough. Of course I did not expect it to be a page turner like a Tom Wolfe novel, I understand some books are trickier to read but are worth the trouble. This was not such a book, the good bits were not enough to carry the whole book.I really enjoyed ""Out of Africa"", and enjoyed ""Babette's Feast"" and thought I would like seven Gothic Tales, alas I did not.I think this book is one that you will either like or dislike, in the same way people like or dislike Shakespeare."
4,Excellent quality for the price!,"Mine's worked flawlessly for over 3 years now, the picture is very sharp using DVDs, VCR, or cable TV. The reception of local stations before we got cable was admittedly weak, so an external powered antenna is probably a good idea. I have the sound coming out through a Sony component stereo system, so all in all it's a very adequate setup.My only wish is that it had S-video or component video inputs for the DVD. Sure, about 2-3 times the screen size would be nice too but then that would be anywhere from 4 to 12 times the cost! This is more than enough for a non-TV-addict like me who basically uses TV about 2-3 times a week to watch rented videos."
5,This is PEPPER,"You know those bland market peppers, or the ""fresh"" pepper grinder pepper?? They don't compare to this. You can actually taste pepper without emptying the entire pepper shaker contents into your dish. And it's a great deal."
5,Tone's Spices.,This product was all I expected it to be. The taste was fresh. The packaging was a perfect fit and arrived by the given date. I will order agian in the future.
5,black pepper,I love this brand. I have been using it for years. It is fresh and full of flavor and the container is great.
5,for anyone interested in social change/justice issues,"This is not just a book for historians. While others testify to the historic accuracy I was more struck by the energy of the book. Mayer considers - through the prism of one life -- the question of what our personal responsibility should be toward injustice. It reminded me of my favorite Margaret Mead quote, ""Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed people can change the world -- indeed, it's the only thing that every has."" That's a slight paraphrase, but Garrison personifies it perfectly."
3,Overkill,"There can be no doubt that this is a thoughtful historical work about Garrison. Nor should anyone doubt that Garrison was an important figure during the time leading up to the Civil War. However, the book is some 630 pages long and has mountains of minute details about the abolitionist movement. Every obscure activist is mentioned no matter how unimportant. I got the feeling that the author wanted to impress readers with the scope of his knowledge about Garrison and the abolitionist movement.In all of the detail, I felt that some of the sense of who Garrison was was lost. I have read the book and learned a great deal, but the gold nuggets in the story were obscured by all of the details."
4,Took me awhile....,"BadA. The narrative pace is just awful. I don't know what it is about this book I almost didn't make it past the first 40 pages because the begining moves so slowly.B. The idiotic ""conspiracy theory"" idea regarding the Texas Revolution. Someday right minded people everywhere will be able to laugh conspiracy nuts right off the street.GoodThe book has a great deal of information regarding the beginnings of an organized abolitionist movement in this country. Garrison was the focal point for this when the movement started to move beyond isolated groups of idealists and Quakers and started to be taken seriously as a genuine force for social change.Overall-Once you get into the book it is amazing, but you have to be in the right mood to do so."
4,Provides a fascinating new dimension to antebellum history,"Henry Mayer successfully brings forth Garrison from the two-dimensional treatment he gets in both standard (high school/college) history & even in more scholarly works on abolitionism. We get a full-featured view of Garrison as a human being & family man, as an agitator, and, importantly, Mayer is able to put him into historical context very well. The first 2/3 of the book are the best. I found the narrative dragged some after that, in part because Garrison's role as an original firebrand had faded by then. I highly recommend this book."
3,A sign of things to come,"With surrogate motherhood now virtually a mainstream reproductive option, attention should be paid to this Sixties time-capsule (protest street theater!) that explored the idea first. (That Ms. Hershey, then at the peak of her youthful loveliness, takes an impromptu skinny dip has nothing to do with it. Really!)"
4,Fine translation,"I have previously read classic Max Muller's version and some translations foud at numerous web-pages. I think this is clearlythe best of them. Carter and Palihawadana have retained texts lyric style but still their ambition is to bring autentic text as such to us. Hence reader have to use glossary where most importánt words and referensees are. I may be a bit annoying butIf you really want know exactly what what is in original dhammapada you has to use such method. Some at web ""intreprete""too much, then the text may look easier but It may go also wrong.Only negative comment is that people to which english is not native language, text may have too mamy many fine but unfamiliar words. I recommend this book. It is one of the classics of Worlds religious teachings."
5,Good product.,"Not much to say here. One of the best Kava products (for the price) out there that I have found. Works great, and the price is great. Will buy again."
1,"Kava is great, this product isn't.","The problem with these Kava capsules is that this in not a concentrated extract. The active ingredient, the kavalactones are not in very high quantity based on the recommended serving sizes. I felt NOTHING with 2 capsulesAlso, the genetics behind the Kava root are very, very important. I don't THINK this is a top strand.The liquid gel caps are superior and you actually feel the effect. The Kalm Down Tonga Kava Powder is fantastic. That will give you the effect you desire."
1,Complete Placebo,"I bought this product with the hopes of becoming a bit more relaxed. According to research I had done, including product reviews on this site, this product was the way to go.Unfortunately, the product does absolutely nothing. I'm not relaxed. If anything, I'm angry, because the product doesn't work. I'm out $8. Do yourself a favor and keep looking, this ain't it."
4,"Supposed to calm you down, not so much for me, but great quality business","This is exactly what you should expect for any herbal supplement. I'm sure there is some calming effect but I haven't taken enough to mark it down as clearly greater than a placebo effect. That being said, the company shipped it in great time and well packed, definitely a company to trust."
1,Does not work for me.,"It didn't work for me, at all. No noticeable effects what so ever. I took 2 on my first day, then 4 the next, then 8 the next. I took 8 for the next few days and still nothing...If you are looking for a Kava product from which you can actually feel the effects, this is NOT it."
1,Nothing,"I could tell nothing with these. I am gonna try 4 instead of 2 tonight, but 2 did zero for me."
5,good stuff,Kava Kava is a miracle. It is a natural alternative to Xanax. At least for me it is. I only use it when my anxiety gets the best of me and it really really helps to calm me down.
1,Total Crap,This product does absolutely nothing! It is just a huge pill that gives you a stomach ache. DO NOT waste your money!
2,hmm... does this really do anything?,"I have tried taking the recommended dose of 2 capsules without any results. After doing that for a few days, I tried 4. I felt slightly tired and one point, and it seemed to cause a slight stomach ache. Did nothing that it claims socially."
4,"Good Value, Lots of Fun, Messy For Little Ones",I bought this for my daughter on her 3rd birthday. She loves it and immediately got into putting the sparkly gel in their hair...and hers...and all over the main body of the doll. She had a great time and loves it! It's cute and good value for the $$. It's not quite the quality I would have expected but I would probably buy it again if I had it to do over. Maybe better for girls who are a little older.
4,A gift for my nieces (ages 3 and 5),"This toy was well received by my nieces. They enjoyed combing and fixing the dolls' hair and the hair stood up to quite a bit of brushing the first few hours of use during my visit. They jewels to decorate the dolls' tops where nice but I think the toy could have come with a few more hair accessories(barrets,hair bands, combs and the like) as the toy is mostly about fixing the dolls' hair is it not? I would have given it 5 stars if it had."
2,Don't waste your money,"I can't believe this thing has such high reviews.... because of that, I added it to my wishlist for Christmas for my 2 girls, thinking it was perfect with the 2 styling heads. I just saw the review that it does not have makeup, which was a major disappointment as well... Other than that, after you have added the gel and styled it, you are finished. The hair is tangled and the gel is a mess. It is very expensive for such a small amount of fun (if any). I can't believe it has such high reviews."
4,Two are better than one!,"My five year old really likes this set. Great to share when she has a friend over and nice that one is a brunette! Took off a star because the accessories are junk. Maybe just keep the brushes and scarves, toss everything else. Glad to find it on Amazon."
3,My daughter likes it.,My daughter bought this toy for her birthday. I thought it was too small but she likes. I thought it was too light but she likes it. I thought it was way too expensive and of poor quality but my daughter likes it so what can you do.
2,Good leather but not so good case,"This leather case isn't bad but a lot bulkier than it looks in the picture. Also, the way to open and shut it is very inconvenient. Instead of using a snap or velcro which would have been better, you have to slide the flap through a little leather ring. Not only does it feel awkward and take too much time to open and close, but it looks as though the ring could easily break over time. Had I first seen this in the store, I would not have bought it. That being said, the leather is good quality and if you don't mind spending extra time to get it opened and closed, its not a bad product."
1,iConcepts case not at all as it was advertised,"Ordered this for my Palm V, and it came very quickly--as usual; nice job, Amazon!!!BUT, this case was NOT as advertised...the one shipped was nothing like it was pictured...no leather sleeve to put the PDA into; just a stylus-type connector that was supposed to slide into the left stylus holder. Fine, except the stylus connector was way too small for my Palm. Had to send it back.Again, not Amazon's fault---they are wonderful to work with, as usual!!I won't buy anything from iConcepts again, though."
3,T. M. I. for me,This is a great book for a serious Feng Shui (er). I didn't enjoy it. It was far too in depth for what I was looking for. I like tips short and sweet.
2,I would guess there is better out there.,This book was not terribly valuable to me and I wish I had not purchased it.
2,flippant and confusing,This book is too shallow and broad in its overview to be of any practical use. Read it for an encyclopedic understanding only.
3,repetitive,"This book has plenty of good tips, but everything in it is very repetitive. The whole book is structured so that there's text explainging the points, and at the end of each chapter the points are summarized as parts of the ""101 Feng Shui Tips"". That wouldn't be as bad, if the text itself wasn't so repetitive, and if all the points were listed at the end of the book, instead of a few after each chapter. The way it is written, it makes for a boring read, but I read on because there is good information in it."
3,Easy to understand but lack of more graphics!,"Nice Cover,This little book is very easy to read and understand,actually it doesn't give 101 tips because some of them are repeated chapter after chapter, it's ok for beginners, Delivery from Amazon was fast and well packed."
4,Look at Your Home with New Eyes,"I read the 10-Minute Clutter Control (Easy Feng Shui Tips for Getting Organized) before trying this book. That one was easier to grasp, but this one expanded my understanding of placing the grid on my living space. I didn't quite grasp how to use the trigrams in this book though.The book gives about five pages talking about each room, then gives a page of brief tips to get you started.Some of the tips seem so obvious, that you wonder what all the hype is about. It does make you take a new look at your surroundings and creates a desire to improve on it.It was useful to me and is a book that I'll sample now and then to give me a fresh perspective on a room and its layout."
1,This is not Feng Shui,"Don't waste your time or money on this book.It is badly written, contradicts itself constantly, and the writter is obviously not an expert on the subject.It is pure bull aimed for those looking for New Age solutions.If you really want to learn about Feng Shui, read A master course in Feng Shui by Eva Wong. Be ready to do some study and hard thinking, but it is worth it. You'll realize that most of the books you've read on the subject are just based on the fact that we want to better our lives and fortunes and will practicaly do anything to achieve it. Don't let others get rich on behalf of your unkowledge. Research before you believe. Good luck."
4,2 types,Brushtech sells TWO identicle looking grill brushes however both of different quality so be careful which one you purchase. This model number is MODEL : B108C and the LESS expensive one and probably not as good as the other one which is MODEL : B308C and is sold on amazon and is more money and has great reviews. So when you see both of these and you see ones a lot less that is why. the 4 stars is bcuz i had to give it a rating to leave a review.
2,Disappointment,Don't buy this book if you are expecting it to have the full-color photos that are in the original hard bound edition!! This volume uses poor black and white renditions of the color images used in the original.
4,A lovely journey,I really enjoyed Mukulika Banerjee's look into the beautiful but often complicated world of the sari. It provides a great deal of information on regional customs. I was disappointed that the book did not contian more photos.
5,Never say never again,"I loved this book and finish it in one night. It was the ending to the McCoy men mini-series. It just as entertaing as the others filled with steamy passion, romance and comedy provided by the other McCoy's introduced in previous books. All five of the McCoy's are strong, passionate, pighead, fun loving men and I loved getting to know them and their mates."
5,"An excellent product, wonderful for cuddling with baby",I was given this pillow by a friend after I mentioned that I was struggling to keep my newborn baby at my breast while nursing at night. It is a wonderful product! At first I used it to wedge the baby to me and so she did not move at all while nursing. Before the pillow she would start nursing and I would doze off and then she would too and soon she would be howling because she'd lost the nipple. The pillow solved that problem. Now that she is a couple of months old I do not need to wedge her that much as she can stay connected on her own. But I still actively use the pillow every night and during her nap time in the day. It keeps her safely on the bed and I do not worry about her rolling away. It is also great for keeping Dad from rolling on her during sleep. A must have!
1,WTF!,"This was a crazy ass movie...and to me, not in a good way. I always like things that are a little different and out of the norm, but okay they got carried away. I don't even remember seeing the ending. In the beginning of the movie it warns you that there are some blinking lights that may cause seizures, they weren't lying. I gave the movie away to a friend to mine, he couldn't get into it either. This was a no-go for me. I won't even suggest you try it for yourself."
4,Rich and Funky!!,"In the 70's Hancock was a king. This ""Headhunters"" band was of a particular mythology. I own this on vinyl. It is an ABSOLUTE TRIP !!! This is something! Headhunters and Thrust had funk. Mwandiishi and Sextant had space. This has space and funk. I swear, when I was in high school in the late 70's (sucking up whatever US releases of Miles I could find) this album scared me! It is sooooo intense, psychadelic and FIRM !!! It wasn't ever ""more Herbie"". It was seriously KICKIN ""first generation"" fusion, standing on it's own, at it's best then. I'm still waiting>P.S. I own the CD release, now, and it sounds fine. Excellent addition to the ""Mwandishi"" period!!! I mean... REALLY GOOD addition !!"
4,A Back In The Day Jazz-Funk Classic,"This was the album cut by Herbie Hancock's back-up group soon after the massive unexpected popularity of Herbie's Headhunters LP. It's actually much better than Herbie's own follow-up LP, Thrust. The 1st track, God Made Me Funky, is everything the title promises, with a really great, greasy guitar riff (by Blackbird McKnight) holding it all together. One of the very best jazz-funk cuts of all time. The first & last tracks have vocals, the other 4 are all instrumentals.Most of these tracks would have fit very comfortably in Herbie's Headhunters LP. One or two are not quite as interesting as the rest, but the highlights (including the aforementioned God Made Me Funky, Daffy's Dance & If You've Got It, You'll Get It) are way worth the price. The sound quality is first class.If you've been disappointed by more recent Headhunters releases, join the club. This one is the real thing -- accept no substitutes."
5,Music for after dark...,Awesome mellowness with the perfect blend of flute and vocals to get your groove on. Play this low over a candle lit dinner and she'll be putty in your hands.
5,Excellent Well Organized Introduction,"This Book is well organized, illustrated and written. The various aspects of Aztec Civilization and History are organized into seperate Chapters, making this Book both, a good Introduction and Reference Book. A look at the Bibliography reaveals all the right sources. Scholarly, yet accessible."
4,Clean deal!,Fast service and item condition as stated - Good! Will be used as a reference source for extensive study of this field.
4,Japanese reissue,"The same track list of US version. This japanese reissue have been forgeted after the 2006 australian version with 2 bonus track, and the 2006 reprise reissue in US.1. Alone2. I Surrender3. I Could Not Love You More4. Still Waters Run Deep5. My Lover's Prayer6. With My Eyes Closed7. Irresible Force8. Closer Than Close9. I Will10. Obssessions11. Miracles Happen12. Smoke And Mirrors"
1,No Discernible Point,"Let me start by saying two things: First, I am fascinated by America's car obsession and associated land use; and second, I could not finish this book.I have really enjoyed several books on this subject, but ""Lots of Parking"" seems to be just a list of statistics about how many parking spaces were available in one particular city over the 20th century. If you flip through the diagrams of this city (which are legion), you get the idea that the downtown core has been given over to parking garages. Okay. That should take something like five to ten pages. The rest is all a weird assortment of anecdotes and statistics; the authors are just showing off how much research they did with no overarching narrative of what is happening to our cities and the people who are parking the cars in all those parking spaces.It seems like if you're looking for some statistics, you could bypass the book and do the research yourself; the source materials probably aren't as dry as this book."
4,Good dictionary,"This dictionary is good for beginners. It has basic phrases, days of the week, months, and other stuff at the front and back. Not good for advanced speakers. I recommend a more advanced dictionary for advanced speakers."
5,Excellent remastering by EMI,"Don't let the 1931 recording date put you off. The remastering has done away with the hiss and pops usually associated with recordings from this era. By all accounts, this is one of the great recordings of Werther and belongs in any serious collector's library.Davis' version with Frederica von Stade and Carreras is also excellent and I'd hate to be without De Los Angeles & Gedda's account but you owe it to yourself to hear Thill in his prime."
2,Not as Good as Strub or Hodges.,"For example, Shulman does not provide any norms for the FAS-Test (a test of verbal fluency) even though it provides lengthy instructions about how to do it.The Mental Status Examination in NeurologyandCognitive Assessment for Cliniciansboth provide norms for this test.Neither Shulman norThe Mental Status Examination in Neurologyprovide the acutal test for the Trail Making Test, butCognitive Assessment for Cliniciansdoes. My own recollection is thatThe Mental Status Examination in NeurologyandCognitive Assessment for Clinicianscomplemented each other well when I read them both and cobbled together my own, prefered cognitive test battery and data for interpreting the results of it. Together, the other two books are about the same cost as Shulman. I myself would buyCognitive Assessment for Cliniciansand then go from there."
2,Not my kind of book,"This book is packed with excellent information, but such info is very hard to extract. The style is verbose, and there is no way to differentiate what is mandatory to know from what is advisable to know to what is impermissible not to know. Because of this poor design, it is almost useless unless you already know the topic pretty well.If you are specializing in the topic, buy it. If you are planning to buy this as your first clinical neurology book, find something else."
3,The Life and Campaigns of Lt. Gen Thomas J Jackson/ Dabney,"I found this to be a difficult read, full of prejudices with very lengthy chapters. One would have to have a thorough knowledge of Civil War History and Virginia geography to get a better understanding of this book. The time period it was written (1865) with no obvious revisions may explain a lot. Many officers are mentioned without any indication of who side they are on, it was like an expectation that you knew who these characters were. The character of the Union generals and battle outcomes are written in such a manner giving no credit or respect. A Confederate withdrawal was mostly a skillful maneuver white a Union withdrawal would be a cowardly route. I am generalizing but the prejudice is there."
3,Beutiful book about the glamorous seaplanes;but many errors.,"This is a big beautiful book about the glamorous seaplanes that flew the oceans. The illustrations are excellent. However, the text contains many errors. For example: the aircooled Bristol Jupiter engine is listed as watercooled, Martin and Osa Johnson had one S-39 and one S-38, not two S-38's, the Sikorsky S-42 was not designed to be appreciably larger than the S-40, the S-42 was designed with much lower drag so that it could go faster and farther. While a matter of opinion, the choice of planes did not include the Aeromarine Curtis 75, the first Flying Boat in regular America-Overseas service, nor the VS-44, that joined the Boeing 314 Clippers in providing flying service between Europe and America early in WW11. Also it would have been nice to have some illustrations of the later Latecoere's, not just the early 300 model."
2,very poor beginner's book.,This book is very poor instruction for a beginner it assumes you know how to read music and the cd is WAAAAAY to fast for a beginner to follow.
4,Good but could have been better,"Love the Smoky Mountains so I am letting you know up front I am going to be biased. There is a dearth of high quality video of the Smokies out there so I jumped on this when available. Overall the presentation is fine but could have been better with more shots of the actual mountains instead of ""Ranger Bob"" lifting logs looking for bugs. The more educational material was good but I was hoping for more views of the beautiful mountains as well as some of the beautiful fall color the Smokies are famous for.For the price is really is hard to complain however. If you love the Smokies it's a no brainer. If you have only a casual interest then you probably should knock a star or perhaps two off my rating.Again, I love me some Smoky Mountains so I am just glad to finally have some HD material on the subject."
4,Beautiful scenery,"Great movie with beautiful scenery of the Smoky Mountains. If you can't be there in person, just pop the movie in."
3,It did teach!,"I thought I'd see more. The photography did not show a lot of the mountains. When the Geologists, etc were interviewed, they talked and more was shown on the ground in the woods.I did not see many people around with binoculars and cameras. I've seen many Mountains and would have liked to have seen more photos, etc of the mountains and more color and beauty.Too much talk."
