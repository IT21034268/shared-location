5,Excellent book,"This is an excellent book, it explains both Continental and English style of knitting and shows how to do many things in detailed illustrations. It teaches all of the basics and some intermediate designs and it makes it all simple to learn. I am so glad that I purchased this book. I already knew some basic knitting but I needed a book that explained the rest of what I did not know."
4,Wonderful,"This book is wonderful - it taught me how to knit. It is straightforward, has clear pictures, and is easy to understand. I've gotten many other books since, and am happy I learned with this one. From a great author, it is unpretentious and very helpful."
3,"good book for average beginners, but not for dummies!","This is a great book if you wanna learn how to cast-on, cast-off, knit and purl. It teaches you how to do those things in great details!But that only account for the first couple chapters.. the rest of the book, maybe its just me but it gets real difficult.For someone like me, a real dummy, who has no one to actually show me some of the knitting technique, I have to learn everything from the book. Even though I do think the book would be a great reference for someone who already have a little knitting experience, it is still too much for a pure beginnerFor example, some of the most basic detail, the author still fails to elaborate. (I still have trouble understand exactly how to do mattress seam.)ANywayz, it is still a good book for beginner, if you have someone to teach you when you get stuck and don't have to completely rely on the book."
5,Knitting for Dummies,Directions are straightforward and fairly easy to understand. I purchased the book because of the other reviews - my nieces want to learn to knit and have decided that I am the one to teach them. I am making progress and have almost finished my first scarf. Excellent reference book for stitch combinations that I had no idea existed.
1,dust collector,"I bought this book along with the visual guide to knitting, figuring that between the two I would be able to get the hang of things. This book is not one for ""dummies"" the instructions are difficult to understand and the images are worse. I eventually gave up and just used the visual knitting to figure things out. Highly recomend that over this book!!!"
4,Knitting for this dummy,"I taught myself to knit with this book fairly quickly. Getting started was a little confusing, though and I had to do an internet search to find a video to watch about it. Some things are very clear and others I had a lot of trouble with (although I'm assuming it's just because I was learning).I've not worked my way through all of this book, but I would say that it's a good way to get started knitting. =)"
5,Good book to start learning how to knit!,"I like this book. It provides a good start on the basics of knitting. I've used it as my go-to book for the past year now, since I started teaching myself how to knit. When I was trying to decide what book to order to teach myself from, one reviewer had commented that it's a good idea to have at least 2 knitting books. That way, if you get confused about a particular technique or concept, you can check the other book and see what it says. I strongly recommend that strategy. Overall, this is a good book for getting the basics down. It has a few patterns and some basic stitches are discussed, so if you want more advanced stuff like a stitch dictionary or lots of patterns, then this isn't the book for you. But it is a good book to help you get started with knitting!"
4,Great for beginers,"I have never knitted before until I got this book. If you want to learn, buy this book. The pictures are great and explain everything step by step. If I can learn to knit anyone can."
3,Inspiring.. but a little difficult to follow,"I was extremely happy to receive a ""starter knit kit"" that included this book. However, I barely went through a chapter before I was lost. Little details about holding the yarn and doing something as simple as casting on somehow got away from me. I was frustrated for a few days and then went to a site online, instantly printed out instructions and sat down to cast on my first rows without a problem. Now that I've been knitting for a few months I have gone back to the book many times for useful information, but did need a different explanation to get me off the ground. Even now that I know what I'm doing, I still can't follow how these directions would have made sense"
5,Much better than its title,"I strongly recommend this book as a beginning reference. It's extremely clear, gives basic information I couldn't find anywhere else (like what to do when your gauge is off in only stitches, or only rows), and really good practical tips that I haven't seen anywhere else. Has good patterns to get you started also. I first bought a similar title (not ""for dummies"" but something similar- the covers are orange), and I took it back to the store and exchanged for this one, which is MUCH better."
2,IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A GOOD KNITTING BOOK KEEP LOOKING,This book is okay but if you are looking for a good how to knit or reference book I highly recommend: The Knitters's Companion or Vogue Knitting The Ultimate Reference
2,Disappointing,"I'm sorry, this was kind of boring for me. I'm a new knitter and I need lots of pictures and patterns to keep me going. This doesn't have that. It is all about the nuts and bolts of knitting -- not cute patterns that I HAVE to run out and buy yarn and make."
1,Knitting for Dummies,"Not a good way to start out someone learning to knit. Not terribly well-written, either."
3,Pleasant JapBop,"I had heard a version of ""Never Been in Love Before"" on the radio and wanted to get a copy for this song. I thought that Mr. Yamada was a capable but not very adventurous player who played a melodic watered down version of Bird or Stitt. It sounded a bit too much like wedding band music but, while not ground-breaking or innovative, was well played and inoffensive."
2,Buy a PaintMate Instead,"Send the few extra dollars and purchase the PaintMate or TurboRoll instead. I have owned all three models and strongly recommend against the Paint N Roll. I don't know why they sell this model, I guess they want a lower entry price product. Anyway, since you are manually forcing the paint into the roller, you have very little control over the saturation level. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! Too much and it starts dripping and too little means not enough paint on the wall. The PaintMate uses a ratcheted handle to maintain precise saturation and the TurboRoll uses a battery driven motor to do the job. It is hard to roll the paint on the wall and manually force paint onto the roller at the same time so you have to stop to do it. With the other two models, you just keep on rolling as you feed the paint."
4,17th Stair is to Reading as Hot Dogs are to Eating,"I was an English major (several degrees actually), so I know that this is not a good book by any real standard. But it's great junk food reading, and sometimes that's just what you're in the mood to enjoy. I first read this book in junior high, and I've read it several times in the last two decades since then. The Seventeenth Stair is to reading as hot dogs are to eating, and every once in a while, a hot dog just hits the spot."
4,V-shaped cushion,"Arrived promptly. It's a little heavier than I would like. I bought it because I wanted something to sit on and support me when I go to yoga trainings and we spend time meditating or talking while sitting on the floor. It comes with a carrying handle so the extra weight shouldn't be a big deal. I ended up with this one because it was less expensive than the yogitoes cushion. I like both products for different reasons. The yogitoes one is lighter, but the hugger mugger is more supportive, either way, you can't go wrong."
3,Okay Pillow,I purchased this to take to my yoga classes but it is too heavy to lug around so I returned it. If you aren't planning on carrying it somewhere or don't mind the size and weight it might suit you. It just wasn't for me.
4,A fun Lowbudget horror Anthology,This movie was alot of fun. I am a big fan of lowbudget horror anthologies and if you like those as well you will love this. I especially loved the segment with Calico Cooper! :) i'm a big alice cooper fan
4,Solid Gut Churner,"As far as anthologies go, Junkfood Horrorfest is sophomore effort that has some teeth. It is uneven, yes, but leans more toward the classic Tales from the Crypt than newer schlock like Dr. Terror. I think Chemical Burn has the right formula here: some homemade grue, lots of campy fun and, most importantly, a good time. You can actually tell that these performers and the filmmakers are enjoying what they do. It translates on screen. Not a bad little film."
2,White wash.,"Hard to believe as fact. Just seems too simple. Seems like the author came to a conclusion rather than finished his studies. The Aztec calendar is clearly a complicated subject. The only people that will have any real knowledge, what's left of it, will be any living Aztecs."
3,good,but this series of cds has a tendency to use a dj technic of making songs sound like they are skipping. Plus they also add some really corny tunes which you would not normally want. Granted you do have a chjance to hear songs you might not have ever had the opportunity to hear but so aren't worth the space wasted on the cd.
4,"Another solid, funky album.","An early recording by the Fatback Band that originally appeared on the Perception Label. Why the album 'Let's Do It Again' claims itself to be a Bestof from the Perception years remains a mystery to me, since there are no tracks on it from either this or their other Perception album 'Feel My Soul'.This is a nice little soul infected CD from the time when soul was about to become funk. The main emphasis is on the horns, there are some keys to give a fuller sound. The drumming is a bit more varied than on the later Fatback recordings, and this I enjoy a lot.There are also some sweet soul tunes, like 'Gotta Have You (Day By Day)' and the seven minute 'Baby Doll'. The whole session is a party though and it's worth joining in. Funky highlights are 'Kiba', 'Nija Walk (Street Walk)' and 'Clap Your Hands'.Not an essential album, but if you have the chance get it."
5,Grommets,"Beautiful finish on the grommets, and just the right size for my projects. These are difficult to find at craft stores, glad they carried them."
5,A cool read,"A previous reviewer has said that Cool Repentance is not the best in the Jemima Shore series.For me it was. It was my first Antonia Fraser book, and I loved it. I read a few others in the series, but Cool Repentance is still the one I enjoyed most."
5,In the Land of Possibilities,"In the land of I AM...brings forth a spiritual musical journey. You will find every quality, every emotion and every message of love, joy and bliss weaved into the music on this cd. Every musician is at the top of their game. Every note falls into place with absolute perfection.You will find yourself knowing and singing the words almost instantly. This cd is filled with chants that are perfect for any occasion. My wife and I are constantly spinning this cd when we have company over, and every time the people visiting say, ""Where can I get this cd?""I will wrap this review up with a suggestion and then a few words from the cd itself. Suggestion: Treat yourself to the gift of Rickie's music by purchasing this cd NOW! And...now I take a moment to remember this: ""The breath of God is breathing me, I'm breathing in the breath of God, I know that all is well."" And so it is!"
1,Great looking poorly designed,I purchased this Fauset a few years ago and am now looking for another fauset only to find everybody else had the same problems with this fauset I have.they say limited lifetime coverage.basicly they just cover the ceramic valve and not anything else. My fauset started cruching as I would rotate it. I tookit appart and found below the beautiful stainless steel outer covering was a totally disolved metal core. water had entered via the removeable nozzel andentered the base and rusted this thing to nothing.I used to look to moen for making a fine product until I discovered they spend money where you see it and totally cheap out where you cant..Do not waste your time buying this fouset unless you plan on selling your house shortly afterward.
2,Meon faucets are not reliable,"I got moen faucets for the entire house. One started to leak within 2 months. The most expensive one, the kitchen one (7560), have been leaking for years. Not too much water to be noticed, but kept the parts wet and getting rusty. Bad products. I am going to replace them with a different brand."
1,Fancy junk,"The faucet came with our almost new house. This Moen has been leaking down into the cabinet below. Got a new cartridge. Well the inside wouldn't come apart due to corrosion.Lots of little cheap parts inside that had to be broken to disasemble.My old house had an old DELTA that I rebuilt 2-3 times from 1985-2005, and the kit was just a few dollars.No MORE Moen for me!"
2,Moen faucet not up to expectations,"Faucet head does not want to stay seated in body of faucet, it slips out by barely touching it. I had it installed professionally 6 months ago and now the handle does not want to stay on unless you turn it on at least 75%. Not impressed at all for a faucet of this price."
3,Adequate,"It seems to be made more cheaply than the Moen I replaced and the water pressure is lower as well. Looking for a white faucet, I had to go online as there was only one option in the stores. I may not have chosen this faucet if I could have seen it in person."
4,OK for the price,Amazon price was great. I installed the faucet myself. The onlt reason that I did not give 5 stras is the head of the faucet quality which is not so great. Any simmilar product from any other brand would cost more without any advantage.
2,Drips after 2 years.,"We have had this faucet for 4 years. We thought what we were buying was a high quality pullout faucet, and the lifetime warranty helped the sale. However, this faucet will start dripping on you in 2 years, and after getting replacement parts from Moen, it will drip again after another 2 years. Look up other reviews on the net before buying this one. For us, it really was not worth the hassle of calling Moen again. We're going with a Grohe.2 stars because it will work fine for 2 years."
2,Doesn't last,"I got this faucet about 6 years ago and have had to replace it twice because the handle broke. The company gladly gave me a new one at no charge after it broke the first time, but I had to pay a plumber to install it, so this time I'm going with another brand. Also, after a year or so the faucet extension never worked very well. Conclusion: it's way too expensive for what you are getting."
4,informative and authentic read for middle grade readers,"Bruchac approaches Sacajawea through primary sources, which is an amazing experience. The events and characters of the book are derived directly from the words of the men on the Lewis and Clark voyage. Unlike many biographers, Bruchac doesn't play fast and loose with the facts, which adds significantly to the value of this book.However, the failure of this approach is that Sacajawea herself did not write her own memoirs, so the contents of her head and heart can only be guessed by what the men who surrounded her wrote. In these pages, she seems too perfect, too flat. Bruchac tries to bring her to life through adopting her voice and using a framing device where she's addressing her son, but it isn't convincing the way the depictions of the other characters are.The book was otherwise a pleasure to read, with many fascinating and authentic details. It was perfect for my 9 year old."
4,The Adventures of Sacajawea,"At first, this book seems a little confusing and it took me a while to realize that every story is being told to Sacajawea's first born son, Paw-ump, and they are the stories of hardships and rejoicement. Some of the stories are of foolish men trying to bring down a Grizzly bear all on their own, while others are of when the white perigouge was about to sink, and in the very beginning of this book, there is the story of Sacajawea and Otter Woman's kidnapping, when they were taken away from their loved ones by the Miniteretees. This engaging and adventerous novel is reccomended for middle schoolers."
4,interesting read,good history read moved fast some times in the mountain pass were left undescribed more detail should have been included
4,If you like Keri....,"I rented this just for the fact that she was in it. But I have also seen ""The Curve"", and she was not very good in that. Of course it was a smaller part, so there wasn't much to work with I suppose. She was surprisingly good in this movie, and some of it was actually pretty funny. Her part is not like Felicity though. Unless you can picture her riding in a beefed-up Camaro. She still has a sweet side to her though. So if you are at all curious about the flic, I recommend you rent it."
1,Eight Days a Week,Although I bought this movie in Feb. i didn't try to watch it until April19th it would not play because it had a region code error whatever the hell that is. don't buy a product that does not directly come from amazon.com
2,Must be a devoted Keri Russell fan to appreciate this!,"No nudity or foul language, but much sexually oriented language. Parodies scenes from popular movies. Crude but cute, funny at times. Worth seeing for fans of Keri Russell. (Believe it or not they spelled her first name Kerri on the jacket!)"
2,Sigh,"It was ok, but that was about it. As I think many people have said, it's for those who really like Keri Russel, but didn't testher acting ability at all.Oh, and it can be bought on DVD out of the UK at blackstar, andmaybe amazon.co.uk for those of you with multizoning."
1,Bad Movie,"This movie is really awful. It ""might"" be funny if the viewer is a low IQ teen-ager but for the average movie-goer it is just plain bad.The movie is billed as a romantic comedy and I suppose it is but the humor is not funny and the romance is not romantic.The lead character sleeps on the sidewalk outside the house of the object of his affection. His parents are nutty and his neighbors are nutty. None of the characters are believable and the dialogue is gibberish."
5,See This Film!,"If you ever had a hopeless crush or been placed in ""the friend zone"" this is must-see. Joshua Schaefer is charming, witty, and adorable. You're rooting for him from the very beginning. Keri Russell is perfect as the dream girl. R.D. Robb plays the perverted wingman to Schaefer and provides his fair share of laughs.Peter (Schaefer) has been in love with Erica (Russell) for all the years they've lived across the street from each other. Finally, the summer before they're both heading to different colleges he decides to camp out on her front lawn to prove his love for her and declares that he will stay there until she returns the sentiment.This movie has great observational humor. It's funny and relatable. I saw it shortly after it first came out and tried for ages to find the DVD. Now that you've found it on Amazon, you should buy it. It's definitely worth owning."
3,Great 90's flick,"To put it bluntly, a classic peace of 90's filmaking, they dont make movies like this anymore. I wish they did, but they dont, this movie is not quite as popular or well known as other big 90's highschool flicks such as American Pie and Cant hardly wait. But it is a must see. Once the credits start rolling, you should have a smile on your face. Its that kind of movie."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though it has earned a bit of a cult that might argue otherwise, Eight Days a Week is a fairly generic raunchy teen comedy--not especially good or interesting, it was shelved and forgotten for a reason."
2,Poor Follow-up,"I'll admit, I'm new to the Heep. My first CD was the remastered version of ""Demons and Wizards"" which blew me away. What a great hard rock album... ranks right up their with Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin of the early seventies. This CD, however, lacks any real stand-out tracks, has very corny lyrics (very ""Tap""-ish), and only has one small section that really rocks (the guitar/drum midsection of the song ""The Magician's Birthday"".) I don't know how this album was received back in the day, but I'm sure the band lost some of the following they may have picked-up with ""Demons and Wizards"". I highly recommend ""Demons and Wizards"" to any Hard Rock/Classic Rock fan. I'd pass on this one. I'm not sure if I'll buy any more Heep albums after this."
2,Cheesy. Very cheesy.,"I've tried quite a few times with this one. ""Dated"" seems like the wrong word to use, considering this IS a recording from the early 70's. However, it does sound dated in a bad way. Bad lyrics, corny vocal techniques, and too much organ make this sound like a parody. I didn't know that Uriah Heep was the inspiration for Spinal Tap until today when I read these reviews. However, I had already come to this conclusion on my own. Most of this album really does sound like Spinal Tap without the humor.There are only two tracks here that I find listenable. ""Blind Eye"" is OK and ""Tales"" is actually great with it's pedal steel guitar and vocal restraint. I'm giving this two stars simply because of ""Tales"".What I'm really surprised by is the praise that other reviewers have laid upon ""Sweet Lorraine"". It's a very straightforward and repetitive song that doesn't serve any purpose other than to show that this band is capable of sounding generic, as well as campy/corny/cheesy."
4,Magician's Birthday (CD),"The disc and case were in perfect condition, if you like Uriah Heep I recommend this disc."
3,Too much abuse heeped on this band.,"Don't let the great Roger Dean cover fool you. These guys were never in the same league as another band that sported Dean covers back then (Yes). And granted, all the references to demons, wizards and magician's tends to get a little goofy (ala Spinal Tap). But there's no denying that songs like ""Sunrise,"" ""Blind Eye,"" ""Echoes In The Dark"" and ""Sweet Lorraine"" are GREAT TUNES. So don't waste your time trying to over-intellectualize these guys. They were the perfect hard rock band for 1972 (along with fellow Brits Deep Purple) and should definitely be listened to in the context of their time."
3,"Mellower Than ""Demons & Wizards""","I'm a metal head & most of my music perspective comes from that viewpoint. ""Salisbury"" rocked, ""Look At Yourself"" rocked, ""Demons & Wizards"" rocked (although a little less than ""Look""). On this effort, however, other than the opening track ""Sunrise"", there is not one really hard rocking track to be found. Yes ""Sweet Loraine"" rocks minimally, but Hensley's screaming organ really overshadows nearly everything on this song. This album is far, far from ""heavy"".If you like your music laced with keyboards, acoustic rhythm guitars & with no memorable guitar solos, you could maybe up this album to 3 1/2 stars. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad album. It's a must have for any Uriah Heep fan. But newcomers would be better served to start with the twin purchase of ""Look At Yourself"" & ""Demons & Wizards"". Heck add the ""Live In 1973"" album to your cart if you have the extra cash. Soak in those purchases for awhile before you opt on this one to mellow out."
3,A let-down for the most part,"After Uriah Heep's previous two albums, this one was a let-down. Most of this album is simply boring, with an overreliance on power ballads and bloated ""artiness"". The two exceptions are the slow-paced but heavy opening track, ""Sunrise"", and ""Sweet Lorraine"". The latter of these is one of Heep's best songs of all time, an instantly catchy rocker reminiscent of many other early 70's hard rock hits like Argent's ""Hold Your Head Up"" and the James Gang's ""Walk Away"". Both of the two good tracks from this album can also be found on _Best of Uriah Heep_, which is a better buy."
4,the pretty band like deep purple and led zeppelin,"No matter what the people said about Uriah Heep. In fact, Uriah Heep from 1968 - 1999 sold out their albums from 1969 until 1996 circa almost 100 million copies worldwide. The same case like Zeppelin and Deep Purple, Black Sabbath did.The songs are excellent and masterpiece. Absolutely masterpiece! need I say more??"
4,Another good Uriah Heep album.,"Uriah Heep ""Magician's Birthday"" #31 (1973).Uriah Heep's 5th studio release, ""The Magician's Birthday"", was a little slip over their previous album ""Demons & Wizards"". Again Roger Dean graced his drawing on the album cover. The band stayed the same for the first time. The highlights include, ""Sunrise"", great start to the album, the piano ballad of ""Rain"", the Mick Box guitar of ""Echoes In the Dark"" and the two hits ""Blind Eye"" #97, with some fine bass lines by Gary Thain and ""Sweet Lorraine"", #91, just a good time rockin' and roller. They came out with another solid release in 1973 on ""Sweet Freedom""."
2,Decent planer but very poor motor,"This is the 2nd 20"" grizzly planer I have owned. The first one worked fine for 5 years . It had a 3 HP motor and had enough power if the knives were sharp to plane 1/8"" off a 20"" oak panel. I upgraded to this new one because it is listed as a 5 hp motor and it has solid infeed and outfeed tables. So I was very disappointed when I tried planing 1/8"" on a 20"" panel and the motor bogged down . Tried a pine 20"" panel and it bogged and blew the start capacitor. This has since happened 3 more times and Grizzly has been of no help telling me the motor is fine. Build quality and finish looks good for a machine made in China [my first one was made in Taiwan]. However the Chinese motors are apparently junk. Plan on putting a good USA motor on this if you want to do any serious planing with this. Better yet have Grizzly put a good Baldor motor in it before they ship it."
2,Great - if you're not using a flash,"This attachment (wide or telephoto) is a good addition to your Canon A620. However be aware that the close proximity of the flash unit on the camera with the adapter itself, means ""flash"" pictures will include a shadow on every shot. (It looks like a part of your finger ""thumb"" or ""Pinky"" that is accidentally blocking part of the lens.I tried all sorts of adjustments but could not avoid the shadow. Probably the only sure bet is to use some software program to retouch the print.Again, this only happens when you use the flash (i.e. shooting a group shot on the living room sofa) If you don't plan on using the flash, or if there is sufficient lighting, to turn off the flash, then you won't see the shadow.The adapter is also useful in attaching telephoto lenses, filters, etc.I tried to upload a sample photo of this but was unsuccessful."
1,Probably not worth it,"I bought the lens because I'm a Realtor and often find it difficult to get good shots of bathrooms or areas with small doorways. The lens creates a shadow around all four corners of the shot and the only way to avoid it is zoom in a little, defeating the purpose of the wide angle lens. It helps a little, but not as much as I had hoped for. You also can't use the flash because the lens creates a shadow in the middle of your shot, just like other reviewers had mentioned."
3,"A minor movie, poorly directed.","And Tony Jaa misses a lot of kicks. This is a movie where fake stuff is abundant. I was very disappointed, mainly because I watched ""Tom Yum Goong"" first. This film is second rate compared to that one. Sure, Tony Jaa is amazing, but still his performance is second to his next movie.Well, simply stated, ""Tom Yum Goong"" is the best ever."
3,Not his best work,"While this movie is good, it is not his best work. See The Protector for a great martial arts film."
4,ong bak rocked,"This is what I have been waiting for. The fight scenes were about as they could have been. This is one of the most unique movie I have ever seen, not the story but the action. Worth watching if you like to get REALLY pumped up during a movie.Oh god its Maddog, AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
5,Amazing Action Flick,"It's no Macbeth, but damn if it ain't kick ass all the same. Tony Jaa's pure energy and physical prowess are sure to become legendary. This is an outstanding movie from an Action stand-point. The story telling is corny and predictable, but hell, thats not why you're watching to begin with.No wires, No CG, just pure martial arts action. I promise there will be several moments where you rewind the film and scratch your head. ""How in the good-God did he just do that?"""
5,Who was that guy?,"I've never heard of this guy before, Tony Jaa,but he is the best martial artist I've seen onthe screen in a long time. He is obviouslya well trained expert and his abilities are onglowing display in an otherwise forgettable movie.The plot takes a distant backseat to Tony'sexpert martial art abilities, but who cares?I honestly didn't think I'd make it through thefirst 10 minutes, but I'm glad I stuck with it.Tony is incredible and amazing in his craft.Although there's not a single person in this film (Tonyincluded) who wouldn't benefit from an actinglesson or two, the emphasis is placed upon Tony'ssuperior fighting skills, and he delivers with a killer punch.Don't miss this film!!"
5,"Great Movie, Great Martial Arts","When I saw this in the movie theatres, I pretty much was dragged in by my friends, as I had never heard of a movie named ""Ong Bak"". However, I'm glad they dragged me there, because this movie has some of the greatest martial arts I've seen in a movie in a long time. There's no ropes, flying around, fake and stupid stunts. It's all real, and it goes along with a pretty decent to good story. Highly recommend to see and buy."
3,Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior,"This movie is packed with action as a good martial art movie. It is of a very simple story line with predictable sequences, but the action is really good. That being said, dialogues are irrelevant; therefore, translation is not a mayor hurdle. Likewise, English subtitle is silly to the point of translating the sounds. However,the action compensates all of the downside features of the movie. Summing up, it is a good entertaining movies for those who like action and martial arts in one."
5,Bruce passes the torch,"The search for the next ""Bruce Lee"" has always been somewhat of a futile endeavour, until now, and this is actually the truth this time. Being somewhat jaded and hard to impress when it comes to an array of once formibadle masters struggling to maintain their personal best beyond their capacity, I watched this film out of mild curiosity, and was promptly blown away, and impressed way beyond my expectations. It is no overstatement stating that Asia has sent their new ""Dragon"", or professing that the new ""Bruce Lee"" has arrived. Tony Jaa is without a doubt the next sensation in martial arts, and very simply does not have an equal at the moment. He has the skill, at least, of Lee, and yet more heart, and his name has immediately become etched among the pantheon of the greats. Watch him, and be amazed, no matter how jaded you think you are."
3,Fighting 5* Acting 2* Technical 2*,"Hey who doesn't like a good martial arts flick. Well this one isn't one. The main character Tony Jaa has a future ahead of him if he can brush up his acting skills to match those of his fists.The plot was cheesy, the acting was worse, the fighting was slick but got tired of the 3 angle instant replays everytime something even remotely cool happened.This movie is best watch with a group of friends, a few cases of beer, and ad-libing in your own lines as our hero does one after another flying elbow or knee to the neck of his opponents. It's just like playing Tekin but without the button mashing."
3,Ong-Bak,I cannot really give a review on this as it was purchased as a gift for someone who had the 2nd one and wanted the 1st. He liked the 2nd so much he decided he'd like to find the 1st. I don't think I'd be able to give a fair rating since I haven't seen any of the movies.
4,Excellent fighting scenes + Thin plot + Uninteresting dialogues,"I'm one of the many people who watched this movie because of the fighting scenes. They are worth more than the cost of the film. Tony Jaa does not use any wire. His fighting style is different than Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and Jet Li.The plot and the dialogues are a joke. But who cares?It's definitely worth buying for martial art fan."
4,"excellent fight scenes, cool stunts!!",all i can say is that i am very happy with my purchase and i recommend to all!
2,Jackie Chan does it better,"The general consensus seems to be that Tony Jaa is the next Jackie Chan. I flat out disagree. At the very least, Tony Jaa lacks the cinematic charm and appeal of Jackie Chan, and at worst he lacks the martial arts abilities.This film had no plot or story, the script may as well have been ad-libbed, and the acting was horrific. But that apparently doesn't mean much because Tony Jaa is capable of ""tricking"". I've seen him perform, and I think he'd get his [...] kicked in a real Muay Thai fight; his background is TKD spattered with enough MT to make him look somewhat beliveable. Otherwise, all he does are tricks. And they're not even very good tricks. FLashy kicks and spins which will appeal to a non-martial artist while the real martial artists just shake their heads and giggle uncontrollably at the stupidity of what he thinks is good for fighting.Let Jackie Chan be Jackie Chan, and leave this one on the shelf."
3,What is so great?,"Is martial arts movies in such bad shape that people are calling this new guy great just becouse he's new,there is nothing great about he's moves ecxept they do look powerful.And whats up with the dvd cover on the back it has a refrence to this guy's move's would put Jackie Chan to a chaoprator yeh right Jackie could do this movie's intire stunts and fight scenes in 1 day.About the dvd its awful it forces you to read closed captions if you wacth the movie in its original language,how does that get by the people who make this dvd.I understand the need for HEARING IMPAIRED tracks but dont make it mandatory for all.ALL in all its not a bad movie if you can get past the first 30 boring minutes and if you dont expect fights scenes that will blow your mind(you may get that impression from some reviewers).Watch it but you may want to rent it!"
5,Pretty good,"I love martial arts movies like ""Enter the dragon"" with Bruce Lee and ""unleashed"" with Jet Li. this movie falls in to the same place but you have to know that this is a different fighting style and all based on muay thai. Really cool movie though. I bought the movie based on the preview and amazon reviews and was not disapointed =)"
5,Good movie,"It's pretty simple really, this movie is good, Tony Jaa isn't going to win an oscar anytime soon, but man can he kick some butt. His moves are awesome, and he is so fast. I liked this one so much I actually ordered a few of his other movies. The action is great, the acting maybe not quite so much, but no body watches these kinds of movies for it's superb acting and dialogue, right? My only complaint is why is it when they dub voices, they feel the need for the Asian woman to sound like an annoying twelve year old, that drives me nuts. But this movie is definitely a must have for any martial arts fan."
5,Tom-Yum-Goong,"Ong Bak is breathtaking. Tony Jaa's ""new"" film ""Tom-Yum-Goong"" surpases it. Jaa not only fights but he acts. The story line is a heartbreaker. As much as I missed the Tuk Tuk chases, the elephants made up for it. We watched the Thai version with Chinese subtitles and the story line was solid even for me with only a street knowledge of Thai.Some of the ""Ong Bak"" regulars are back in supporting roles. Don't wait for the English version, find the Thai version. Forget the dialog, cut to the chase. I sat here eating my Tom Ka Gai and drinking my Beer Singh longing for my seat in the karaoke bar in Nong Khai. Epic film.Don't miss it.Good triumphs over evil...but at a price."
5,Never thought a human could do that!,"I don't know how many times I thought that watching this unbelievable movie, but it was alot. Tony Jaa can do things that are hard to comprehend at first, thus they've provided replays with multiple angles for the truly insane stunts. I KNOW people got hit, and hit hard several times in this movie, either with knees, elbows, staffs etc. They aint playing around in the fights here by any stretch. Ting (Jaa's charactor)is an a$$-kicker of the first degree, even making Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan look tame by comparisson. I hope to see Tony Jaa in many more films. Doing a 1080 degree jumping kick to the face with your legs on FIRE...just nuts...10 stars!"
5,Best Action Movie I've Ever Seen!,"Simply put, this movie has the most impressive martial arts that I have ever seen. Done without any wires or CGI, the action in Ong Bak makes up for any deficiencies in the plot or acting, something I had thought impossible in a movie until recently. Tony Jaa's stunts and general physical abilities are simply beyond beleif. Watching Jaa jump over cars, run atop his enemy's heads and doing double front flips off obstacles many feet high, the reality of the film is just so much more impressive than big action movies currently replacing their actors with virtual ones. Granted, the Matrix is one of my favorite movies, but the action scenes just don't compare with those in Ong Bak . If you like action movies, you need to see Ong Bak."
4,Jet Li beware!,This movie is packed with amazing fight scenes. The main character is an amazing martial artist. If you've ever liked a Bruce Lee or Jet Li movie then you'll love this. This movie has no strings or digital affects that make the actors do impossible stunts. Everything in this movie is done by the actors. The only drawback to this movie is the fact that in some parts the dubbing isn't that great. When they are trying to be serious you just might break out laughing because the dubbing is so horrid. But overall the movie is great and I recommend it!
2,"Fun Action Flick, Terrible Blu-Ray transfer","This has honestly got to be one of the worst bluray transfers on the market. I currently own over 100 blu ray movies, and have sat and watched every single one of them. I can safely say this is as bad as it gets. little to no upgrade from the DVD. infact, many upscaled DVD's produce greater video quality. A fine action outing, though rather amature especially in scenes like the the go-kart chase. It shows tremendous potential from now action star Tony Jaa, which we have seen fulfilled in more superior films such as Tom Yum Goong (The Protector) and this films sequel Ong Bak 2. Although we have yet to see his real acting chops, no one is watching these films for that. Still, If you own the DVD there is absolutely no reason to upgrade to BD. If you dont own the DVD and cant find it anywhere for a cheaper price then you might want to hold off on a purchase. I suggest sticking with Ong Bak 2 which has an infinitely better transfer though still not perfect."
3,If you like Muay Thai over the top,"A mix of the traditional Bruce Lee Kung Fu movie style with Muay Thai as the vehicle. Standard plot line...evil villian steals the spiritual center of a village and a young innocent Muay Thai fighter is sent to retrieve it. Standard comical side kick helps him in his quest. (No real beautiful love interest though...oddly missing). Is tricked into fighting in the ring crazy farangs (foreigners) using traditional Muay Thai to overcome their foreign ways. And I don't think I'm giving it away, but he wins over all odds! Cinematography is okay...fight scenes are fun...sometimes over the top, but still, entertaining. If you like Muay Thai, it's a good comic book style celebration of it."
4,great movie,great martial arts movie from Thailand! I bought this awhile ago and liked it so much gave a couple copies to other friends
4,Great action,"Great fighting screen, plot needs work and movie moves slow. Picture color goes from dark to light. I gave it 4 stars because of the action."
4,Very good,I love martial arts movies.. this was pretty good. The story was typical.. and predictable but that didn't take away from the action. I could have done without the double and triple retakes though..
5,A new legend on the horizon!!!,"I'm Kung-Fu expert, and believe me when I say ""this guy is next action superstar"", he combine cualities from past legends: Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and Jet Li, all in one character, the man is ""the new man in martial arts movies"".I'm also a tv producer, and I highly recomend this movie for the great story(not a regular one)that inspired you deeply, the action is awesome and well balance, the stunts and fights have everything and a lot of new stuff never seen.And one last comment:NO WIRES, REAL FALLS, REAL KICKS ON THE FACES, REAL NEW CLASIC.I dont mind if you guys give me one copy as a gift!Luis Dordelly"
5,Excellent,This is an excellent book. I originally checked it out of the library numerous times. I am so happy to have my own copy. Very highly recommended.
3,"Some tunes wonderful, others annoying","A relatively early album by a fantastically talented tenor saxophonist with a great sound and a fluid delivery. The ballads and (relatively obscure) standards like the title tune, ""My Shining Hour"", and ""Stars Fell on Alabama"" are great. I found some of the other tunes irritating -- they seem mainly vehicles to show off technical prowess or gimmicks."
3,Worth reading,A very good and well known study on ethics in the NT. Should be balanced out by Hays treatment on the same subject for a fuller view.
4,Secrets of Fat-free Chinese Cooking,Saw the author of the book actually cooking several of the recipes featured in her book on Home Matters with Susan Powell. Simple to make recipes with short-cuts for busy people. Wonderful way to get the taste of take-out at home with half or less the fat.
2,The recipes are not fat free as claimed.,"Many recipes call for sesame oil. Some call for nuts. Neither are fat free even though the amounts called for are small.I found many of the recipes tasteless, but will keep trying and keep you posted.Because we eat only fat free, I deleted the oil. That may have made a difference, but then, the cookbook shouldn't have been advertised as fat free."
5,Fat free Chinese cooking,This book is packed with information and if you follow the recipes it can even help some to loose weight. This is an excellent addition to your cookbook shelf with easy to follow directions and good food to boot!
1,how bland can you go,tried the tofu hot & sour soup and found it to be soooo tasteless... areal waste of good fresh ingredients. i will try some other recipes but i'm not off to a good start.
3,worked well but short lived,Ink arrived quickly and as promised but did not last for as long as I had expected.
2,Not what I expected,"This book is not at all what I hoped it would be. While the title entices, the content disgusts. The deer that Mr Philips writes of are dead. Who would want to do such things to as beautiful an animal as a deer? However, in spite of the horrible content, the wonderful pictures of the magnificent creature warrant two stars."
5,Never stop struggling for what we deserve!,"I would rather say just one word ""Great"" about the book ""The Gadfly"" authored by Voynich, an Ireland female novelist.I can recall that I heard the name in Chinese when I was only six years old. Gadfly can be confused with rogue(pronounced with accent in south China) In fact, I read this book just before my graduation as a M.E. I also lost my once love before that. My own mood made me feel much of what Arthur felt. He loved his father and got to be betrayed. He loved the girl and got to be mistaken. He loved his country and got to be viewed as an unnormal personal(I mean not only the physical, but the mental). That's the life? that's what the life can give us?Absolutely not, remember it:Never stop struggling for what we deserve!"
5,The Gadfly,"An outstanding book that preteens to older adults can enjoy, learn from, and recommend to their friends. I have read it in a Romanian translation, a little over 10 years ago, so my memory of the details is challenged today. What I remember is that I considered the author a genius in so keenly capturing extreme human emotions and qualities, expressions of a lofty character. I cried and laught, I learned and I grew spiritually by reading this one book: The Godfly. I need to find it again, and Amazon was my last hope. The Romanian copy that I read more than 10 years ago wasn't even mine. I borrowed it from a friend."
3,Not bad,A pretty good read. C. B. Hawes is absolutely talented. If your into swashbucklers at all this one will fill the bill.
2,"It's ok, but confusing","I wanted to really like this book. However, I skipped the entire middle bit and read the first 40 pages or so and then the last 50 pages or so. I don't feel like I really missed anything (other than Vo was blind, I guess). I found it really confusing to keep track of what decade the story was in and how many secrets Ruth Anne had. Stuff happens before the book that I didn't figure out how it affected them until almost 10 pages in.It's probably a really good book if you can do stream of consciousness and flashbacks with no warning--I had problems with it this time."
3,Not JD's Best,"The best song on this album is the title track, which is lovely. The rest, while sweet and sentimental, are rather less catchy. It was rather hard to top his first album, but I din't consider this one of his better works."
4,Angel from Montgomery,"You have to appreciate that it is most simplistic to criticize an artist for their excess, not for what did well.This album was an example of some stunning interpretations of songs that worked for this artist. Angel from Montgomery, Please Daddy and Rocky Mountain Suite are vital, warm and stand the test. It is disappointing that John Denver never received his due for this type of work.Along with Darcy Farrow and Mother Nature's Son on Rocky Mountain High his work was true. You can ask for little more.Plus, he could sing. A high true tenor. Ease up on the criticism and open up to his manner."
4,"Quirky, off-beat material that any Denver fan will love","I have listented to this album hundreds of times. My father used to take the tape along when we went fishing in Wisconsin and we would listen to it over and over together. The material is a real departure from what John Denver usually records. There is a John Prine song in there, a Christmans song, a song about the Canadian Rockies, and it all fits together to form a relaxing, interesting record. I highly recommend Farwell Andromeda to any John Dever fan. It's different, but I bet you'll be playing it over and over just as I have.mike grabowski"
5,Best early John Denver,absolutely one of my favorite albums. I grew up listening to this with my mother. Berkely woman and Angels from Montgomery are 2 of my favorite songs.
3,Awesome Label; Bad Resellers,"Be very careful who you are buying these labels from! The Amazon resellers have been recently shipping Spanish-labeled packages of very old stock. The labels we recently received were thinner and yellowed compared with the ones we ordered over the summer.The Avery 6464 labels are awesome for all sorts of applications (we use them for temporary book labeling in a library), but BUYER BEWARE -- you may receive someone's older, inferior stock."
2,Not as pictured,"Received old, yellowed labels in another language. Not as pictured here. Fortunately i am just planning to use them as labels for my homemade wine. If i needed them for any other purpose i would return them as they are NOT what i ordered.UPDATE: I ordered this product again and made sure it was bought from Amazon and this time i got exactly what I ordered, as pictured. Make sure Amazon is the seller!"
3,Need to be binded better,"I read the over veiw of the product it said some highttlighing in the book that was true,what they didnt mention was the stickers on the cover and the binding coming off i was not ok with the condition of the book it was in ok condintion"
2,"Product ok, delivery just so-so","I ordered this product for my son's required reading. The price was very good but the shipping took the longest within the guidelines even though the seller stated that the book was available to ship out the same day, I received notice that it didn't ship out until many days later. When it finally arrived it was not in ""good"" condition; I would have rated it lower."
5,The Eyes Have It!,"If you like trivia you won't be able to put this book down!WWWith over 250 pages,you'll enjoy reading this book PACKED with information.Learn that it took movie make-up artist Rick Baker 10 hours a dsy to Create the werewolf in""An American Werewolf In Londo.""Find out what the 5 most expensive paintings are.See a mountain that rises out of the sea to a height more than twice as tall as the Golden Gate Bridge towrs!You will lose yourself in this book filled with facts on every subject imaginable,and a few not se imaginable.You won't be able to take YOUR eyes off it."
5,CBX Gold Portfolio - A 'MUST READ' for every CBX lover,"Excellent compilation of CBX articles over time. Allows CBX owners and lovers to understand how this motorcycle impacted the biking world on its introduction and how it perfomed compared to its peers in those days. A definite ""MUST READ""."
4,...Green Papaya ; a poignant movie,"I already had ... Green Papaya on VHS and was eagerly waiting for the DVD to come out. While the transfer is good, it is not widescreen as advertised (1.66:1)! The end credits are in a modified letterbox but the movie is 1.33:1. Itlessened,somewhat my enjoyment of this film.I wish that the DVD had been in widescreen as it was and still is advertised!Edd Kerriegolden@shaw.ca ."
3,DVD,I was pleased with this DVD as I was already familiar with the movie. My only objection was I wished that the DVD itself had not been written on with a black marker as I wanted to give this movie to a friend as a gift.
4,"Yes, this movie is slow","I will not lie and say this movie filled with car chases or explosions. If you expect an action flick, look elsewhere.I understand people's reaction to the slowness of this movie because when I saw it, I thought the same thing. However, over time I came to appreciate it. What this movie lacks in plot, it makes up in beautiful scenes and images. There are not many movies that leave you thinking about it years later."
2,A Sleeper.,"The visuals I admit were very intriguing in this film. But the dialog was BEYOND boring. I recommend ""To Live"" over this."
2,Orientalist Tripe,"This movie was a great disappointment. It was poorly plotted, limply directed, and the acting (especially in the ""grown-up"" second half) stiff and unconvincing. The main actress grins dumbly as she blissfully goes about her chores... ugh. An Asian ""Pretty Woman."" I suppose that the occasional curfew klaxon and roar-of-jet was a (snif) ""poignant reminder"" of the tragic politics unfolding over the wall of the sound stage. But the movie felt like elite Vietnamese and wistful French colonialist nostalgia. Bah! Overrated! Avoid!"
2,A pretty postcard and nothing more,"This movie is visually beautiful with its idyllic set and soft lighting. But, please, if you want to keep my interest, try adding a story to the mix. The movie has the thinnest plot, if you can call it that, and has minimal basis in reality. If you want to see pretty moving pictures and nothing else, then this video is ok."
1,The Slowest Movie Ever Made,"This is the slowest movie ever made, and also one of the least meaningful movies I have ever seen. There is nothing redeeming about any of the characters, as they are not fleshed out to any degree. Why? Because the director was obsessed with bombarding the viewer with silent, mind-numbing, atmospheric cinematography, at the expense of everything else. It therefore explains nothing about the most important element: its characters--the PEOPLE!I hated this movie; so did my wife. So should you. It was a complete waste of time."
1,Beyond Boring,"Nice images, but the dialogue is dull and there really is no story up through the first hour. Cannot tell you what happens after then, because this is one movie that I had to turn off at that point. There's no there there."
2,It'a a joke,"60 Minutes - Swimming with Sharks actually lasts less than 13 minutes during which nobody is swimming with sharks. If you're looking for a documentary on great whites in South Africa, just look elsewhere."
4,Review of Renault's 'Fire from Heaven',"I found this biographical fiction better than Renault's edition of the Thesiad, but still notably slow. Her attention to detail doesn't suit me, personally. I would prefer a shorter book with less time spent carefully decorating each scene--the history here is exciting enough. This is my main point. I'm not convinced 'Fire from Heaven' is any better than existing historical biographies of Alexander."
4,Excellent Historical Referencing,"This title incorporates a clearly and well-researched history of Alexander the Great's younger life, and then fills in the details we wish we knew. Although the novel reads quickly and excitingly, based entirely upon the scarce facts on Alexander's youth, it falls a bit short in a few places. Alexander's relationship with most of his peers is mostly discounted in order to write more about his friendship with Hephaestion, a friendship which is left enticingly platonic but with many not-so-gentle hints that there was much more to be told of them.Personally I think that the storytelling fails here, because you don't get enough of either plot element. What you do get is a clear picture of Philip and Olympias as parents who have great love for their son, Olympias unfailingly so, but who cannot and will not love each other.Some captivating scenes seem to have been adapted for Oliver Stone's 2004 film Alexander."
5,Wow! What a novel...,"This book left me dumbfounded. Mary Renault's elouqent writing truly brought out the personality of Alexander the Great, a man who once seemed a far and distant hero. This book brings you upclose to Alexander's life, starting when he was about four years old. Watching Alexander grow from a little boy to a young man was a new experience. I almost felt as if I was there, watching him grow up. At the end of the book after he had killed many men, I felt almost empty, looking back on the times when he was little, when he played with his dog and friends. I know what it is parents must feel when they see there children growing up and leaving them. This novel was one of the best I've ever read."
2,Fire from Heaven,"I'm sorry, but I was quite disapointed with this book, I wanted to read about an Alexander ""Great Military Leader"", but apparently the author is more focused on Alexander's sexual inclination, and reading throughout the book about his Homosexuality, wasn't what I had in mind. As for action, there are authors with much more emphasis in regards to the actual battles, than what Mary Reanult handles. In very few words, the historical content is non impressive, the action is missing, and the homosexual content is constant, if any of those aspects bother you, DONT READ THIS BOOK."
4,Trollhammaren,"Good CD, the music has a fast tune you can get into and it sounds perfect, but this one in particular is a little short."
5,GOOD BOOK,You should read this book if you like mysterys.If you like to be kept in suspense and can't wait to turn the page this book is the right one for you!!
5,double thumbs up!,This book is interesting and full of suspense and excitment. To all nancy drew lovers out there..... this ia a great book that I personally LOVED. It kept me wondering what was going to happen next. There are several mysteries that all lead into the big mystery Nancy is asked to solve. A widow named Mrs. Puttney asks nancy to help her find herstolen jewlery that is replaced by fake imitations. She claims that she sees her husbads ghost and spirit talking to her telling her to do different things. Then there is this girl named Lola who was put into a trance. well i wont tell you any more because I dont want to spoil it for you. but READ this book!
4,The John Deere Way Performance that Endures,As an employee it was not much new news. Good book for a non-employee interested in John Deere. It is a few years dated as CEO's have changes since the book was written.
5,Best toys,"I enjoy most Mcfarlane toys.The Quality is unequaled.The detail is amazing. It is and will be seen and art,on the level of any precious collectable.It's like walking into a museum,and being able to pick up the most sacred piece and playing or just admiring it with all and every sence.You want to touch them, there amazing. They really are,Janis is honored and would be honored to see these great toys for herself."
4,dog w/ delicate stomach could eat this,My pure bred pug reacts to lots of stuff but he's been able to eat this treat. I hope he doesn't develop an allergy to this too. Be aware that many pure breeds can be delicate and have intestinal issues. Luckily he's a small dog so a little goes a long way.
5,Advice from the trenches,"Morrell is great. He dispenses with the tired tips every aspiring writer has heard over and over (""write polite query letters, always enclose SASE, offer to speak at book club meetings..."") and instead provides real world insights on what it takes to succeed in the shark infested world of writing. You won't feel as though you're sitting through a classroom lecture on the business. Everything Morrell offers comes from his experience of climbing up the ladder from the bottom rung. He has been where you and I are -- working like a demon and hoping for a break. Morrell explains in clear language how to make that break a lot more likely. If you're tired of the dog eared tips offered in 75 percent of ""how to"" books on writing and publishing, this is the breath of fresh air and optimism you've been looking for.-- Mark LaFlamme, author of ""The Pink Room."""
5,It's a great toy!,"I bought this for my daughter-in-law, who has a collection of Muppet figurines. She absolutely loves it! That makes it a good toy in my book. Thanks!"
3,"Description of methods, rather than a teaching guide","This book is a collection of marketing research techniques described at lenght. Serves well as a reference to what happens (conceptually) in each technique. It does not serve as a teaching guide, since there is very little description of the actual procedures involved in performing the techniques. Additionally, almost no information on the actual statistics behind each technique."
2,Dated and badly edited,"This text was required material for my Marketing Research class. Each and every chapter had grammatical errors that made reading the material painful. Much of the information is also dated; there is little in the way of internet survey methods covered in the book, it was still concentrating on phone surveys. In many areas, the book was overly simplistic; not a graduate level text."
1,this book is a piece of garbage,The book does not give any practical view on the subject. The theories are vaguely narrated but not explained. Overall structure totally misses the point of teaching - the concepts and methodoligies are used within the text and elaborated later. Sections explaining various mathemathical models I consider being incomprehensible.
1,Outdated and Overly Simplistic,"This book is incredibly outdated and overly simplistic. The latest edition actually discusses floppy disc research. It is painfully slow and dull to read, and the research process diagrams are overly simplistic. For example, the book defines recognition of a problem in 3 bullets, one of which is that ""Something must be expected to happen."" Really?In addition, the binding is really poor and has broken on at least two copies I know of.On a positive note, it can provide some good laughs."
2,Looks Ok - Works Un OK!!,"This watergun may look neat, but it is just another one made By Hasbro. It Does not shoot 35 feet. I tested it and it blasted only about 18-20 feet. The Woookie Water Blaster is OK for small watergun fights, but it will be drenched in big ones with the ARM XL 4000, and SuperSoaker FlashFlood. The water capcity is OK, but the shooting power is not. Summerizing, toys may look good, but don't let that convice you they ARE good1 If You want to waste money, go ahead, but I would reccomend saving up for the future just like I did. So as newer,maybe better waterguns come out you could buy those. Again Looks Good-Works Un Good!!!!"
2,bad thing!,It has weak range and the sounds drain out if you put them in water! You are better off with a arm xl 4000! thw wookie blaster does not shoot 35 feet! more like 25 feet!
3,This gun stinks!!!!!!!!!,"This is definitly a water gun that you would never want to by:( If you want to get a good gun that is afordable, then get the ARM 4000 XL and/or the Flash Flood!!! This gun is not the gun to buy!!!!!!"
1,Don even think bout buyin dis,Man this is one cheap water gun. This aint even a water gun. its jus a collectible for all them people that like star wars. I don even have this gun and i no it don work.I would rather get one o them cheap squirt guns that u get a dolla store for 50 cents. but If u really wanna wet yo friend's then u gots to get the Flash Flood/ or that big Xi 4100 Arm ( i don no the name but it was sumtin like that).
4,Highly Recommend this for parents w/ toddler and baby,"This is such a good stroller that I had to take the time to write a review. I use it allll the time to go shopping and for walks to the park. It is an easy way to keep 2 kids together..Plus if the toddler gets tired then he/she can sit down and ride along. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because there is nowhere to hang your bags or a purse. There is a basket, which is handy, but its not the same as being able to hang bags on the stroller handles."
2,Not overly impressed,"I bought this stroller largely because of the excellent reviews that I read on this site. I have a 5 year-old son, 3-year-old daughter and an infant. I have been using the stroller since my baby was born in February 2009. The first time I tried to fold it up in the cold winter the frame cracked and I returned the stroller to the store to exchange for a new one. I am still quite unimpressed by the cheapness in quality as compared to the single Evenflo stroller system I used to have. As the other reviewer said, it is very difficult to push and manuever, as well as to fold and lift (for me). The front seat does not seem very padded or comfortable, and is not large enough to lie the child down and change a diaper with ease as I used to do when out & about with my other children (at county fairs, etc.) I like the stroller for it's utility, cupholders and the large storage area underneath. I'm sorry to say, that's about it though!"
5,Great and fast service,I ordered the cartridge because it was cheaper than any other store in my area. The cartridge arrived in a timely manner and in perfect condition...Thanks so much.
2,recycled ink cartridges,"Sometimes you win. sometimes you lose. I've had good ones and bad ones. You are taking your chances. But they do refund them if bad. Thing is sometimes I buy a lot at one time and by the time I get to the bad one, it's been over 30 days and they hesitate to refund."
1,Don't buy it,The store just opened up multi packs of printer cartriges and resold them individuall. Not cheaper or larger volume than that at the local store. Not factory packaged. I would not recommend it.
1,Waste of Money,This is nothing but a one-page news release that offers absolutely zero information. I was very sorry to waste my $6.
4,He Ate EVERY THING!!!!!,I liked this book because it takes place in the ocean and it's a cartoon. My favorite part is when the shark eats the teacher . It was fun to read. If you read this book you'll love it.
1,Doesn't make the case for Atlantis,"An interesting book and an occasionally enjoyable read, although some of the theories are very bizarre and completely lacking in support.My primary complaint however is that although the author makes a small case for the possibility that sumberged lands exist in the far east, he completely fails to make any credible argument to connect these submerged lands to Atlantis. Since the author has tried to hype the Atlantis angle and failed to support that hype, he gets one star."
2,Not Michael's best,"Sorry, I am a fan of Leigh Michael's, but I have to say that this is not her best. Half way through the book, I wondered if this was even written by her. This book is like a very old Harlequin, where the couple barely tolerates being around one another (and she is a cold fish) and then, ""Bing"" a light goes off and the girl thinks, ""Gee, I think I am madly in love with him"". And you think, how could that have happened? Anyway, Leigh Michaels always has a good story, but this one lacked character depth, and you just can't get into 'feeling' that there is any chemistry between the two (normally what the writer is so good at). Anyway, buy and read at your own risk."
3,Beautiful performance ruined by terrible art direction,"THE VALUE OF IGNORANCE is a concert film by Sinead O'Connor. It was released in the early 1990s and contains songs almost exclusively from her first album, THE LION AND THE COBRA.Sinead's singing is beautiful, but this video is ruined by the terrible art direction; you don't get a ""clear"" picture of Sinead in all of this video. What you get, instead, are ""negative"" images of Sinead (like holding a film negative to a light bulb), psychedelic swirls, and bizarre images, superimposed onto Sinead, making for a very disorienting experience. Sinead's beautiful vocal performance is all but ruined by the bizarre effects. It's very frustrating."
4,Trollope's Travels,"Anthony Trollope was a well-traveled civil servant, and his adventures infuse this book with a diversity of settings. Locales include England, Ireland, France, Austria, even a steamer headed for Panama. So while the customary motifs of Victorian conventions tie these 10 short stories together, the broad range of scenery provides a rich kaleidoscope of places for the reader to visit. The narratives, meanwhile, are similar in sympathies to the shorter fiction of Thomas Hardy; compare for example ""Alice Dugdale"" to ""The First Countess of Wessex."""
1,Wordy and uninteresting.,"I read a lot of books of the fantasy genre. I picked this one up on sale at a store while traveling.It didn't take long to figure out why it was on sale. The most appealing part of the book was the cover art. The content is hard to read and doesn't keep your attention. I found myself having to read sections of each page multiple times because it seem that the smallest thing would distract me. Once my eyes left the page I would totally forget what I had just read. I contribute this to her using so many discriptive words in every sentence and the fact that it just wasn't interesting. I never had the feeling of being pulled into the story.If asked to recommend a book of this genre to someone, this one would never enter my mind."
3,"Good Characters, Same Story","I enjoyed reading about the characters that Howard created. They were well drawn and executed. I will probably pick up the next book in the series though may wait till I can get it used. The problem with the story is that it's nothing new. It seems that Howard has read a lot of other fantasy novels and has incorporated aspects of several of them (such at Tolkien, Robert Jordan, etc) but not really created anything of her own. She doesn't even explain most of the aspects in her book that are different from what we would expect on Earth because they've been explained by other authors.Her book is a good, quick read if you're not looking for something new."
2,Not quality product,"Worked for less than five minutes, then wouldn't turn on at all. Feels and looks cheaply made. Not as bad as the one I was hoping to replace, but there is no justification for this quality of construction costing more than 15 dollars. Maybe yours will not burn out. If mine kept working, I might have kept it. It did seem to produce good UV light. I just don't know why no one can make one of these lights so it doesn't feel and operate like it's falling apart in your hands. Regular flashlights don't have this problem. Anyway, I've returned product to seller, and have already ordered a different style. Will review that one when I get it."
1,"confusing, full of errors, poorly written","This book was a horrible disappointment. My students hate it and I find it very difficult to wade through. It doesn't talk much about Java 1.2; in fact the title is a laugh. And so much of the example code hinges around this LISP interpreter that the authors are so proud to show off. This comes at the expense of useful examples. The chapter on RMI left me baffled. Their first example as so abstract as to give me no feel for what RMI does. Then they launch into the semantics of remote references, without even with only two line drawings that I'm still trying to figure out! Very murky and poorly thought out. I get the feeling this book was not proofread or critiqued, and what's more, this is the 3rd edition!!!!"
1,"This book is better named ""Java by Example 1.1""","This book does not contain a single chapter on Swing and I do not know what the author tries to explain in this book apart from what he had already explained in previous versions of this book. This book contains generous AWT stuff and some deprecated jdk1.0.2 methods. It would be a total disappointment and waste of money for a serious programmer trying to learn 'Java 1.2 by example"" based on this book."
1,Not Compatible with Sony DSC-T5,"Do not buy this for the Sony DSC-T5; even though it says it is equivalent to the Sony NP-FT1, you will get an error message when trying to use this battery that says ""use InfoLithium Battery only""."
1,Dont trust the image,the image shown of the battery is not the battery they ship... i got different... a skinny battery which is a waste of money.. how can someone have a image of one kind of battery and ship something else.. i hate this
4,Thunderbolt,If you like car racing then you will like this dvd. Jackie Chan doesn't do a lot of Kung Fu in this one but he still comes out a winner.
3,Jakie rocks,"Las películas de Jakie Chan, aunque no son muy biuenas, valen la pena, nada más por ver todo lo que hace. Los años no le afectan."
4,Thunderbolt different versions,"I have actually seen two different versionsone is in Mandarin which includes a violent break out of jail for Cougar,this scene is mot in the Cantonese versionm which has at least one scenethat isnt in the Mandarin version"
4,New Line gets it right,"I have to agree with others that this is the definitive version of Thunderbolt. I first saw it years ago on TNT edited down to 90 minutes and dubbed. So I bought the Taiwan version years ago. The setback of that one (like most Asian DVDs of old films) was that everyone was dubbed over in Mandarin by different actors, the picture looks old, and the subtitles are so-so. With the New Line DVD, you get the entire film, original dialogue, and better subtitling. On top of that, the picture is clean. The only thing that has been replaced are the opening and closing credits (and that is understanable since the original credits are in Chinese).It's a top notch DVD."
1,Don't buy this version.,"WARNING: This is the worst DVD version of a movie I own (over 200). Shame on Amazon for selling such low grade product (the movie is most definately not remastered). When I found this movie I was excited to order it after watching the TNT version with dubbing and clear picture. The ""remastered"" picture looks like someone recorded the master copy from a VCR tape that had played on a loop for 15 years. Totally unwatchable. You can't even read the subtitles half the time because they are so washed out. I felt the pit of my stomach drop when the credits came up.Now out 15 bucks, though a cheap lesson was learned: Amazon does not check the products for accuaracy.Unfortunatly, since Jackie Chan no longer allows American companies to buy his film rights (due to the hacked-up versions), the only way to get this movie will be if yesasia.com stars to carry it, and even then it will not likely to be in english."
5,Fan of racing and Jackie delivers,I love this movie first saw it 10 years ago my friend owned it and I had forgotten about it until I ran across it on Amazon. If you like Jackie Chan or racing movies check this out you won't be disappointed
2,Not Jackie's Best,"A silly story, bad acting (or should I say overacting), & overblown, unbelieveable action sequences featuring Jackie Chan, the guy who ""does all his own stunts"", being doubled throughout the fight scenes (production was rushed & Jackie was still recovering from his ""Rumble In the Bronx"" broken ankle); not exactly Jackie's best work. Recommended only for diehard J. C. fans, & even then only as a rental (there's a reason New Line Cinema, who purchased the rights to Thunderbolt way back when it was being made, never bothered to release it theatrically). Sammo Hung's fight choreagraphy is cool, though too over the top, but the editing is very choppy in an effort to make Jackie's doubles less obvious."
1,OH MY ACHING HEAD,Bad humor and lots of overacting. This one lasted about ten minutes but then I tossed the DVD up in the air and blew it into tiny bits with my shotgun. WHEN WATCHED: 1/20/2010; MY GRADE: D minus.
5,Very Pleased,"I am very pleased with the jacket. The quality is great, couldn't beat the price and it arrived in a very short time."
3,Musica Antiqua Koln is MAGNIFICENT but....,"I have the final movement of BWV 36c. The music just sparkles with vivaciousness, and brilliance. Musica Antiqua Koln is without a doubt one of my top favorite baroque ensembles. The only complaint I have is with Dorothea Roschmann. She is a fine singer BUT I would have preferred a less 'operatic' voice. My favorite part of the movement is during the soprano solo towards the end and I find myself too distracted by her voice to enjoy it. We all have different preferences and styles when it comes to performers (and that's perfectly fine, diversity is needed) but if you prefer a purer voice type, such as that of Emma Kirkby, Roschmann would not be my recommendation. Too bad. Each man to his own."
4,Recommended,"This was a satisfying crime novel set in a gloomy Russia. It was so gloomy I was reminded of New York in the classic sci-fi movie Escape from New York. Is it really so horrible? But the characters sparkle, especially Rostnikov, as they somehow survive and cope amidst the corruption, crime and depression.This book is composed of three interesting and suspenseful crime stories. Rostnikov's team is split up into three pairs and each pair is assigned to a case. All three tales are compelling and all of the characters, both good and bad, are fully developed.This was as good as A Cold Red Sunrise, which won an Edgar. Recommended reading for all mystery fans."
4,Very nicely done....,I like the Rostnikov detective series because while certainly living in a depressing climate the characters all seem to show their humanity in small ways. Even the gaunt unsmiling Karpo shows that he can care with his befriending of mad genius in the forensics department.If you like mysteries that tell you everything then you'll like this one. I can only hope though that Russia gets less depressing as time goes on because no matter if it is even greatly exaggerated it makes America's ghettos pale in comparison.
4,One of the best Rostnikov mysteries,"Good flavor of Moscow (some hyperbole oncorruption). Characters continue to develop,though perhaps a little too slowly.Karpo is given hope. New boss looks promising.For those that like Rostnikov, a welcome new book."
4,Ghost Force,"I found this to be very entertaining and a good escape.I did not want to put it down. After reading other reviews that were negative, I was just wondering if we had read the same book. The characters were developed adequately to be able to enjoy a thriller like this book was supposed to be. If character development is my main focus,I will read"" Moby Dick"". This book is simply a great way to spend some hours enjoying a good thriller. If you are offended at the implications that cutting defense budgets to the bone has a negative impact on the ability to fight a war and win it, then you probably would not like this book. This world is a mean and dangerous place and only through strength can you truly have peace. If your world view is that understanding the pain of someone who has attacked you, is only important after you have totally defeated them in battle, then you will probably like this book."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Pretty much boy's own adventure, with swearing and special forces. Oracular Admiral Morgan is at it again, with his offsider Jimmy the Aussie, working out what all the horrible, dastardly left wing regimes are up to, and working out how to protect American oil and multibillion dollar corporations yet again. This one is very predictable, except he is making the poms and the argies the targets this time, not the french and saudi fundies like in Hunter Killer."
5,Ghost Force A Hit!,"I read a review prior to purchasing this book. I've read many Robinson books so I was very surprised at the vitriolic review which was very nasty and personal. After reading the book, and it was a real thriller, I can only guess that the nasty review I had read was from someone who abhored the obviously passionate conservatism of the writer. His respect for Maggie Thathcher and disgust for the liberal labor gov't. in England was hardly veiled. Nor should it be. This book is one you won't easily put down. Much, much better than the Clancy Psuedos of late. I give it a double thumbs up!!!"
1,Nothing but political bull,"*I am so sick of the political undercurrents in Patrick Robinson's books that I have stopped reading them. Though the stories are good, Robinson diminishes them by labeling and pigeonholing and demeaning anybody he does not agree with politically - especially Democrats. I stopped reading Scimiter SL-2 because I got so sick of it. I'm sure HarperCollins would sell more books if they could get him to stop the bashing.Comment by Jack (1 comments.) -- June 1, 2008 @ 7:58 pm"
1,Disappointing,"In the Author's note it says ""I decided to accept no direct advice or instruction from anyone"",and it shows.The military tactics are flawed with what feels like lazy writing, not the standard of the earlier books.Will someone explain why Falklanders would collaborate with Argentinians, the Royal Navy sail to certain defeat and the Prime Minister be such a complete waste of time (ok that bit was funny, but...).Will someone tell Patrick Robinson that a Super Cobra is NOT a troop carrying helicopter - a mistake he seems to make repeatedly in all his recent novels.The strength of a techno-thriller is that it should be based in reality, this isn't and the basic errors stood out.Whilst I appreciate this has more than a little justifiable poke at the state of the UK's armed forces, and that Patrick Robinson writes US SEAL & submarine fan books, a little more balanced reality would be nice.Not sure I'll buy his next book based on this one."
1,Enough politics already!,"I liked Patrick Robinson's earlier submarine warfare novels but I left the author years ago. Out of desperation for some new books I picked up three of his recent novels, including this one.I am very tired of Mr. Robinson's sidebar negative comments or hints about the left wing and on-going praise for the right along with the current administration. It distracts from the story and just comes across as unprofessional and childish.And this adulation for the retired Admiral Morgan saving the day, over and over and over is just riduculous and laughable. There are so many inaccuracies in this novel that suspending disbelief becomes nearly impossible.This was my last Patrick Robinson novel."
2,Disappointing,"Robinson needs a new technical editor. He has SEALs stumbling around in the dark without night vision devices, A-4 Skyhawks with 2 engines, a SEAL team that turns into a SAS team after 40 pages, SEALs carrying the tripod for a M60 on a long mission, a long time SEAL with no parachute experience, and a poorly thought out campaign by the British to retake the Falkland islands (apparently the British do not have any stand off weapons such as cruise missles).I gave up on Robinson while reading Scimitar because he had Iranians speaking Arab to each other. As most people know, Iranians speak Farsi because Iranians are not Arabs, they are Persians - the original Aryans.I gave this book a try because the jacket made it interesting but I will not be reading any more of his work."
2,Disappointing in the extreme,"I've been a big fan of Patrick Robinson's books -- until now. Adm. Morgan's my kind of officer and the writing was, up until now, quite good. Ghost Force, however, feels rushed and stilted. The writing, sentence structure, and general feel seem almost like a basic high school creative writing exercise gone awry. Even the military action, usually so well-crafted, feels wrong. As a former U.S. Army SF Medic, I know a little about combat action and this just doesn't come off as well as Robinson's other works. A good novel doesn't have to be hurriedly shaped around current events and most of us don't read this type of story for political edification but for a good old-fashioned, kick butt escape. Better luck with the next one, Mr. R."
3,You Know He's Right - Way Right,"There is no doubt that Patrick Robinson can spin a good tale. Unfortunately, it appears he's never met a right wing politican he wouldn't praise (even George W. Bush a couple of times in this work) or a liberal cause that he could not caricature.Although not in the ""can't put it down"" class, this almost-war story of the near future was a fun read. I did have a problem with Mr. Robinson mixing his British characters with American baseball and football metaphors; having the British Prime Minister ""step right up the the plate"" or the ""so far as the MP's were concerned, this was Super Bowl II"".A couple of other items caused the hackles to rise. Contrary to Robinson's narrative, the Distinguished Service Cross is not the ""second higest decoration"" - at least not in the Navy. That is the Navy Cross. Also at one point, a supposedly experienced Naval officer utters the communications faux pas ""over and out""."
4,Strong later Fall,"This is a very strong Fall record, different from their early material, but very much worthwhile. Mark E. Smith mumbles quite a lot and there are some great turns-of-phrase (he's a handyman...)"
5,Don't treat the LIGHT lightly,"Heavy, hard-rocking FALL at their/his best!Let the LIGHT envelope and consume you!!No regrets."
4,Repetition pt. 3,"the music of The Fall is both engaging and off-putting...equal parts clever and brilliant mixed with the confounding and annoying. the casual fan of punk or post rock will probably be confused. and that my friends, may be the point. or maybe not. you decide. take a listen.The Light Users Syndrome presents a bit of a fuller and more realized sound. the songs are quite strong and show the band in good spirits. this one has a more listener-friendly approach and it's melodies favour the pop side of things a little bit more so than many of their other releases up to this point in time."
4,Sinergy in action!,This compilation is excellent. There is a super session and constellation of consecrated stars.Think in this magnificent theme of dazzling inspiration of Tito Puente. New arrival and so Lagrimas Negras with Cachao and Bebo Valdés. From within with Michael Camilo and Samba Triste with Eliane Elias is another triumph.Excellent choice to get some fun with Latin taste.
2,Hoping for more,"Frankly, I was hoping for a detailed explanation of ABA (Applied Behavioral Analysis) and how it works. This DVD simply says that ABA helps children with Autism and tells the story of two children it has helped. I already knew that. There are scenes of therapists and parents using ABA but no detailed description of the procedures."
4,"Concise, yet rich","The Life of Jesus Christ by James Stalker is a concise exploration of Christ's childhood, his ministry, death and resurrection. This is an excellent resource to learn about the culture surrounding Jesus' ministry. Knowing this information puts much of this period into historical context. I recommend this work. This work was written over 100 years ago, and it's content is timeless. I did find a few words or phrases here and there to reflect his Scottish background, but there was nothing that made it difficult to read."
4,Only the beginning!,"This is the album that pretty much jump-started the Judds' career. Previously, they had released a mini-LP simply titled ""The Judds,"" however ""Why Not Me"" is the Judds' first full-length recording.This album includes some really great tracks...Especially the title track ""Why Not Me"" and the gorgeous ""Love Is Alive."" But the lesser known songs ""Endless Sleep"" and ""Mr. Pain"" are also great additions and like every Judds CD, ALL the songs are great..even the ones that weren't released as singles.This album proved to be only the beginning for the Judds as it scored them their first #1 song ""Mama He's Crazy."""
4,Applause for the Judds!,"This is the album where the Judds started it all! Many of their signature songs are on this album such as Why Not Me, Girls Night Out, Love Is Alive and Mama He's Crazy. Even though I love this album, I found the song, Bye Bye Baby Blues, to be a sleeper. Everything else works with me! This album, ofcourse, is probably not as polished as their work became as the years went by but it's the songs on this album that stapled the Judds into country music."
5,Best of Judds,Every cut on this CD is good. How often is only one song really good? Not this CD. Every song is worth listening to and enjoying.
3,Good debut!,"These guys are one of the best bands at this type of metal!As a debut, it's a great album; they are all great musicians, especially the singer.Going through the whole thing, one cannot avoid hearing a lot of Helloween and a lot of Blind Guardian in this CD, but those are great bands to be inspired by and those guys do it tastefully.My only complaint, on this and their next CD (A Time Nevercome)is the guitar solos lack originality and most times the choice of notes is a bit too plain.A little better on the faster leads though.I love the Michael Kiske singing style!I personally like the whole fantasy-medieval thing, and I enjoy the lyrics.To sum it up, not too original but still good CD."
2,"PLEASE, STOP","From Italy, here it comes a band that tries deseperately to be like RHAPSODY, doing that kind of boring, lousy and mean ""European Symphonic POWER Metal"" or whatever !!! This is emotionless music, it can't even be classified as ""rock"", so clean and overproduced it is. Blergh !!!!!"
3,Not Bad,"Even Steven * Unshackled (Voice Of Thunder, 1995)Even Steven is the latest on the Christian Hip-Hop scene. In some ways he reminds me of the Tim Miner/Artisan /Knightlight era --solid lyrics, but music and flow that can sometimes use an extra boost.""Just Like That"" has a steady flow and a sing-song hook that makes you wanna listen. On ""One For Me"" about E.S.'s wife, he sounds so laid back and at home with the groove. These are explicit Christian lyrics, so blastin' this out of your trunk could lead to lots of open stares and souls being ministered to. Check it out.Picks: Yolanda/ Rollin' Wit FlavaLaZeric Fridell Freeman"
5,Excellent True Crime Book!,"""Unholy Matrimony"" by John Dillman is the story of a murder committed in 1974 as a result of an insurance scam. Two men conspire to take out a life insurance policy on a young woman and then proceed to kill her in a hit and run car accident. It was written by the detective who followed the case from beginning to end. I enjoyed the book immensely. I would recommend it to a true crime reader."
5,"Great entertainment, great study in psychopathy","This book is one of the best of genre. Well written and a gripping story about a dedicated police officer bringing truly evil predators to justice. This is a study in cold blooded psychopathy: An innocent young woman is preyed upon with cold blood by two men who saw her as nothing more than a pile of cash; their plot comes unraveled after a truly brilliant and tenacious investigator picks up the scent and will not let go. Wonderful real dialog as you will read the actual confession of one of the conspirators, the most cold blooded and cruel statements you will ever read.I cant say too many good things about this book.I should be honest and say that I am a forensic social worker living in New Orleans and that the author is a friend. Please believe me, that takes nothing away from my review."
3,Bulk packaging,"Ordered item expecting retail packaging as pictured.Receive loose bulk items.Batteries are new and unused.Batteries work perfectly, just disappointed in packaging."
5,Error,"I earlier gave this a poor review. I did receive it 2 days later than projected, but when I did receive it, I found it was from New York. They have had too many issues from ""Sandy"" for my previous review to be accurate. They did a great job getting the item to me!"
2,Not what I bought.,"I received a photo lithium camera battery, but it was not the item pictured. I called the vendor, and they said all photo lithium batteries are the same. I needed the battery I received, and it works fine, just disappointed that I did not received what I thought I was buying."
3,Not as great as I had hoped,"I bought this album because i love the song Rendez-vu, assuming the rest would be really good as well. Not so much, while the music isn't horrible or anything, once you get passed the song 'Rendez-vu' everything else doesn't really live up to the singles from their first album."
3,Not for a beginner player,"I just started learning the alto sax and figured I try a #3 reed, but found out that the #2 or #2.5 is better for a beginner.The product was fine it was really me."
4,Great Product...terrible duty fee!,"The product is fantastic and I think this is one of about 3 places on the net that even sold it in the size that I needed! It sure came fast, 3 business days later!The only zinger that got me was the 40 dollar duty fee to send it over the border! I guess they don't send many things to Canada and didnt realize that if the paperwork is done a bit differently...it can be avoided."
3,What Drive-Ins were meant to be,"I doubt anyone connected with an Andy Sidaris film ever rented a tux for the Oscars, but that's not the point. The point is to enter a fantasy world, no closer to reality than Star Wars or Blade Runner. These movies are supposed to be fun. Get some popcorn, turn off the cell, put out the cat and enjoy. Even better if you can open the windows on a sumer night and make out with your sweetie as you watch."
4,They look great! Just like OE minus the amber strip. Fitment is very poor though.,"The build quality on these looks good and they havent leaked yet. The passenger side fit without a hitch and I even installed a pair of SMD bulbs for them. The driver side didnt fit though. It lines up with the fender and head lights but the hole for the mounting screw is about 1/2"" off so I had to zip tie it. It holds fine and doesnt wobble since the prongs lined up. It took about 30 minutes to install since the hole didnt line up but if it did, it would probably be a 5 minute install."
3,not the right product,im wondering if the wrong size was sent by accident. im still gonna see if i can squeeze it in.
3,Mostly a retread of earlier Heep,"This album marks a stalling point, it seems, in Heep's musical development. The songs here are merely copies of earlier songs they did, so there's really nothing new here. It is a must for the dedicated Heep fan but others would be advised to spend your money on other, better Heep albums. (e.g. ""Something or Nothing"" sounds like ""Easy Livin'""; ""Wonderworld"" sounds like ""Sunrise""; ""We Got We"" sounds like ""Bird of Prey""; ""Dreams"" sounds like ""Seven Stars"".)The musicianship here is also a low point for Heep. Listen closely to this album with headphones: The musicianship is sloppy and sluggish. The drummer misses beats, they all miss or fudge notes. While some of this can be chalked up to bassist Gary Thain's drug problems (he soon left the band and soon after died of an overdose), there is simply no excuse for the others playing this bad."
4,One of the best,"I'm have say first that I'm still a ""Heepster"" from the Hensley & Byron eraThis Album; Wizard; Magician; The the ultimate Live '72are still in reach of my CD-PlayerCheers to all ""Heepsters"" ""Purple and LedZep"" afficionadosSpecial greetings to Tommy Bolin and Glenn ""The voice"" Hughes.Your concerts with Purple makes me still send shivers down my spine.Ramon"
1,"Thanks, Mr. Hensley","By the time Heep started work on the follow up to Sweet Freedom, the band was in a mess. There was a total lack of inspiration and the increasingly erratic and irritating behaviour of Gary Thain and David Byron, who believed that being a rock star meant doping yourself up to the eyeballs on a daily basis. Byron and Mick Box came up with a couple of miserable tunes and it looked like the upcoming album was going to be a disaster. So Ken Hensley, who by then was working on his second solo album, came to the rescue and offered two tunes he had originally intended for his own record - Wonderworld and The Easy Road. The final result is a miserable album with only two good songs on it. Without faithful Kens contribution, Wonderworld wouldn't even be worth half a star."
3,WHERE IS THE STEREO TRACK?,I was very happy to receive this video-The Beast Of I.R.S Video. I used to rent this film so many times while I was in high school. I thought that I would never find this video but I did. However I was disappointed when I watched it. The video was sealed and new according to Amazon. But as I watched the film the stereo audio track was not on the video even though the cover to the film stated stereo Dolby System. The track was flat mono. Why is this?? Has anyone else who purchased this film experience the same thing?? The video looked brand new. So why did this happen? Overall the film is great! The only problem that I have is the missing stereo track. If someone has answers please let me know.
1,Where's the color?,Bought this as a gift for my boss and was I disappointed. She wears a lot of the colors in the picture and thought this would be a perfect compliment.Was I ever wrong..this bracelet has no color it looks all white except for the few and far between amethyst and peridot. You can't even tell there is citrine.
2,Oh How I Wanted to Love This Bracelet!,"I loved this bracelet in the picture but when I received it, it was disappointing. The colors were more bland than they appear here, and the clasp is difficult to use. I sent it back."
4,Classic authors,"With all fairness to these legendary authors who have endured with us beyond their time, and to their mastery of writing to which we all aspire, it is a difficult old world, almost archaic, style of writing for me- to understand the story beyond the writing. I most enjoyed the first story, the haunted coach ride, and one of the other stories with the rat on the bell rope, but after that, my interest waned somewhat. The stories weren't frightening to me. But the importance of these readings- these are classic writers. I highlighted new words and looked them up- something gained after all."
3,"Humourous, cynical mystery sequel.","""Dead Dinosaurs"" is a bit of a letdown. It is as cynical as the first of the Balam series, but it is just a rung below in quality. This time, Luis Balam, tour guide and propriator of the Black Coral is solicated by his two friends, Hector the mostly Honest cop, and Ricky, the Desi Arnez look-alike. Luis has a client from each, a lottery winner on the run from an ex-con and his two wives, and a slick operator who claims to want to build a cultural theme park in Ho-Keh, Yucatan. Luis smells a rat and investigates both of their backgrounds. Eventually, the two clients are introduced by chance, and the ex-con is found murdered. Luis and one of the Lotto winner's wives race against time to find both men, and the climax happens at Chicken Itza. Good writing in it, as Luis cites more 1974 World Almanac statistics and we see Mexico as it truly is."

5,excellent product,I used this product to hook up a projector across the room from my DVD player and works great! Fast shipping and excellent service!
3,do or die,"This book touches more on interviews of young gang members, but with very vague story line's. She never tells what gang or exact set each person she interveiws is from, just affiliation, Blood or Crip. I don't know why this is important but after reading Monster: autobiography of an LA gang member it gives it a more in depth perception of the person. Also she never really gets into the politics of gang bangin, such as the fractions in crips or the difference between a neighborhood crip and a gangster crip. In the book there is a part where she is interviewing two crips from different sets and one of them is intimidating the other and constantly correcting the other, she thinks it's because one of them is older, but if it were known what set (gang) each of them is from it could be their sets could be at war with one another. For a better in depth look on gang bangin read Monster by Sanyika Shakur."
3,Not a sports book!,"This is not about acrobatics. It is a book used in conjunction with the ESS (Elementary Science Study) set of Attribute Blocks. It is a book for teaching young children about mathematical concepts.Perhaps it is a good book, but I thought that I was buying something different."
5,Good Price,This was more affordable than some other blades we looked at. It's a lawnmower blade. It fits the mower and cuts the grass.
3,nixon analyzed,a somewhat critical discussion of nixon's personality and the theories of how he became the man who was eventually impeached. some valid points inthe book that i was unaware of before and then some points which i just sat back and sighed about
2,The kind of scholarship that makes me sad.,"This is the sort of book that says, ""Oh, those naughty people a century ago! They were so unenlightened, compared to us."" A hundred years ago, there were these horrible women called ""suffragists,"" you see--sure, they wanted votes for WHITE women, but all the time they had all sorts of horrible, imperialistic stereotypes about people who weren't white! If only they'd had modern academics to keep them in line!The scholarship here is often as disappointing as the conclusions are predictable. Burton will take an analysis of a single journal and make it do duty for the whole of a movement. Literary-critical types (and I am one myself) shouldn't delude themselves into thinking they're writing history.This kind of academic book makes me say to myself, ""Maybe it's not such a bad thing that academic publishing is dying."" Sigh."
5,You Must Hear This Music,"It's hard to describe this music without sounding tacky, but one of the descriptives that comes to mind for it is: Acerbic.Bartok's music may not be an ""immediate"" as other composers, but there is no denying after one or two familiarizing listens -- his music really flexes powerfully. It's also kinda creepy. After all the orchestral tension, who would have predicted the rising wail of a chorus in the Miraculous Mandarin, brief as it may be? Bartok's music is full of surprises. Probably the most enjoyable on this CD is the Miraculous Mandarin. Obviously that's the meat. And it presents some of the finest orchestral playing I've heard in a long time. All the performers are in their element, and Bartok's music can shine clearly without the marring of bad playing or bad interpretational decisions. The other particularly enjoyable work is the Romanian Folk Dances.All this music is good, and the performances are at the very top. You can't--and shouldn't--miss out on this."
3,"Nice, but doesn't quite live up","I enjoyed this CD, but felt it was a lot more fussy and commercial then the earlier titles in this set. A shame, since this series was one that seemed to be on an upward sloap rather than otherise--I loved the lullaby CD, and CT 4 was beautiful.Very lacking here was the bell-like beauty of Kate Power's voice, and the simplicity and sweetness of her lyrics."
3,more for java programmers,"after having finished the book, I would have to say that this book is geared toward java developers migrating toward actionscript.it was a mistake for me to start learning actionscript with this book, becase all the examples in this book uses java methology.the examples in this book contains lots of unecessary steps for the comfort of migrating programmers and is not geared toward just flash programmers.if you have previous programming experience, i'm sure this is the best book for you.but for the rest of us, I would recommend something a little easier to start out properly."
4,If you really want to be a programmer,"This book is very technical, have good samples of oriented object. If you are a programmer and want to use your techniques in Flash, this is a great book. But if you don't have a good skill in Flash, I think should be better you try a book with more exercices and pratical samples."
4,Great introduction to OOP,"-This book provides a great introduction to OOP concepts, design patterns, coding styles and other techniques that are vital in producing quality applications.-This book will be used mostly as a learning tool, and not so much as a reference tool.-I am working on developing some applications but nothing too complex at the moment. If you are looking for a book to develop simple applications, or just a want a reference guide to flashMX objects and components DONT buy this book. But, if you are however developing more complex applications that need to be upscaled later, are connected to external datasources etc BUY this book. It will give you examples of best practices and ways of solving your application development questions. Another plus comes in the fact that it is based on ActionScript 2.0, so you will be coding with the most up to date, highest performance and capability available today."
2,hard to understand for beginners,"I am a beginner, I should understand that. But i wanted to buy it still thinking it would have been good. Its probably great for advance people but i found it personaly very difficult to understand as i am just a low beginner."
4,Farkle: The Best Dice Game Ever,"Farkle is an incredibly fun game for the family, or with friends. We have so much fun playing this game, and I recommend this game to anyone at any age!"
4,farkle for all,"we can do this game as a family (my kids are 4, 6 & 8) and we can all do it together. fun to see the different personalities come out as far as taking chances or playing it safe."
4,Grest Dice Game,"Want something little than 10,000. This is it!!!! Easy game to take with you on trips or vacation. Kids can play too.Enjoyed the score tablet too."
1,"Boring, boring, boring!","I have no idea how this game got such good reviews. It is so boring, so elementry, so lame. It's actually a rip of a cooler game called Wimp Out. I love games and hated this one, no challenge, no fun. Sent it back!"
5,FARKLE and sparkle!,"What a fun game! Everytime we get together with friends, we play. We take it with us on trips as it is small and easy to pack. We introduce it to our friends and soon they're ""hooked!""I think it has some educatiional value in that it causes one to have to ""count"", but there is no skill in rolling dice, only luck of the roll!Two or more can play. Doesn't matter how many, only how long it might take with the more playing. It is fun, it is basically a no brainer so easy to play in the evening if you're tired, but want to do something fun.We've enjoyed many hours with this game and, YES, I would recommend it to anyone."
1,"Fun Game, Cheap Components","Farkle is a very fun game to play. The problem with this unit is how cheap the contents in the box are. The dice cup is small and plastic, not the typical leather bound dice cup most of us are used to. The dice are also very low end. My suggestion would be to go out to a bar game store and buy a good dice cup, good dice, and then download the rules for this game off of the internet.It was only $10.00, but it just wasn't worth it."
5,Farkle Fun,"My local discount/chain stores have dropped Farkle from their toy/game shelves. It continues to be our family favorite, letting as few as 2 players and ""as many as we need"" players pass a few hours of time."
4,Fun Game,"This is a nice ""Farkle"" kit. Large dice that are easier to see & handle, and score sheets for easy point calculation. Lots of fun for 2 players to a large group."
4,Great Family Night Game,"My 8-year old son and I love playing games. This one is great. There's a lot of counting and adding involved, so he's learning as well."
5,very good,I really like the ring. Very fun and pretty. It is a pretty big ring but that is ok with me.
2,Doesn't look as impressive in person,"I've had this ring for two years now, and I've hardly worn it. The flowers are not as prominent as they look in the photo, and the ring seems like it's worth about $18 - not $58. If you like ""sparkly,"" this ring won't do it for you."
2,cheap looking,it is a great party ring-but the look of it was cheap and definitely not worth the price! i would have paid maybe $20 for it as a costume /party ring.
2,Disappointed,I bought this ring as a gift for my Mother this year (2009) and was disappointed at the generic look it had upon opening the package and the fact there is a limited amount of sterling silver a la hollowed out underside added to the disappointment.
3,loose stones,I PURCHASED THE RING FOR MY WIFE. NOT TWO DAYS INTO OWNERSHIP AND TWO STONES HAD FALLEN OUT. I SENT IT BACK TO EXCHANGE FOR ANOTHER AND WAS SENT A TOTALLY DIFFERENT RING (SIMILAR PART NUMBER). I AM CURRENTLY WAITING FOR THE RE-EXCHANGE TO COMPLETE (PATIENTLY).
4,"Cute, runs small","I ordered a size 5 to fit my ring finger, my other rings for the same finger are 4.5, it was a little tighter than I wanted but still fits. I would recommend going up a size. Cute ring, not too bulgy, the red part was neatly done except for one or two spots but not noticeable. I'm happy with the purchase. It came in a a little velour bag with instructions on how to care for it."
5,The ring I wanted!,"I am very pleased with the ring I bought, it is different and really beautiful and I have the best impression of EvesAddiction, they have been very kind and most efficient."
5,Beautiful,"Despite some questionable reviews I went ahead and ordered this ring, after all, I had already given my wife the earrings and necklace so I wanted to complete the set. The ring is beautiful! She loves it and loves having the full three-piece set. Only downside is they don't offer half sizes so I had to order it a little large."
4,quality and workmanship,"although I had a problem with the delivery date being 10 days late, once the ring arrived, my wife was in Awe. The quality and workmanship was wonderful. The richness in color and quality surpassed what was expected and made up for the delays. I would purchase from Eve's again. Thank you for standing behind your products and making the customer #1."
4,I have never seen more idiotic packaging in my life,"All the disks played fine. I will say that first. HOWEVER, the package consists of one tall DVD nipple with the DVDs all stacked on top of each other around it. And, they aren't loose. You have to unsnap them from the nipple, just like with any other DVD casing. In other words, every time you go to get one of the disks out of the package, you're in danger of cracking it...or worse, breaking it.This is no reflection on the seller or Amazon. It's the manufacturer's issue."
5,Star Trek: Death Before Dishonor is good!,Star Trek: Death Before Dishonor has some good stories! The issues that were reprinted from DC comics 2nd series is a must have! The reviewer before is right. The Stories take place after Star Trek: V The Final Frontier and not after Star Trek III. I recommend this book because the issues are well written by Peter David! If you collected these issues then I still recommend them for nostalgia! I Highly Recommend it! Peter David is a good writer!
3,Started good but then faded a bit,"When I first started reading this book, I really enjoyed it. The characters were good--Dominic who knows what he wants and is willing to wait and do what he needs to gain Sophie's trust and love. Sophie is trying to regain her independence after living in a bad marriage and living in poverty after her husband left her for another woman. Like I said, it started off great, but the second half of the book feels like it could have ended a lot sooner. It's still a good read so I would rate it 3 1/2 stars."
3,.Out.Of.Con.Trol.,"I read about these guys somewhere, besides on Amazon, and decided to give them a try. They were described as ""chaotic grind"" or whatever. Kinda thought I may be about to hear another decent grind band. Afterall, there are a lot. Well, I haven't heard too many cd's that sound as insane as Erased From The Memory Of Man. Watchmaker play such crazed grindcore, they make Discordance Axis sound melodic. If you like structure in your grind (Terrorizer, Brutal Truth, Insect Warfare) then this may not be for you. I have not heard the other releases by Watchmaker. I have only heard this one. Listening to this cd can actually make you tired. If you're a fan of psycho-crazed-power-grind OR if you enjoy bashing your own forehead with a cheese grater then I would also recommend listening to the following 2 bands: Head Hits Concrete and Threatener.Enjoy ! - Jay in Texas"
5,Here is a book that is worth what you paid for it.,"I bought this book because a women's group that I belong to decided to use it as a model. A few of us browsed and we *borrowed* a few ideas at the beginning..now a year later, the book is our *bible* and we wonder what we would do without the wisdom that the author share with us and their models for procedure that WORK. My admice is that if you are buying this book for a reference..that you consider trying the author's suggestion first, before you blunder as we did..for almost 8 months doing our best..to do our best..finally, in despair, we dug out the book again..and started following directions..smile.IT WORKED...buy now and you wont need to worry later."
4,"Great gun, since when were waterguns educational","I was reading all the reviews and most of them said that this gun was bad and broke easily. so i bought it because it was the only one they had in stock. It does not break! its range could be a little better, because you dont get the 35 feet unless you pump the hell out of it. the flash flood thing is cool, but again, its range is not much. ovverall, this is a great gun!"
2,Do not get this water gun,"I had this water gun for three monthes, then it broke. do not get this gun it uses max-d technology which means it will break in one year. all my max-d guns are broken.Most people think a water gun lasting one or two years is good, its not. non max-d water guns last up to 5 years or more. Im not mad. Im disapointed"
4,super soaker review,This water gun is the better buy than any other that i personally have. Never need to fill it up for at least 8 shots and the flash fllod feature is enough to knock my cousin head over heels!!!!!
2,bad blaster,"The normal nozzle is very weak. Most kids thing it has good range and power. If you want to see good range and power, get a cps2000 or make a gun! It only shoots 35 feet which i am sorry to say is rather pathetic. The triple shot shoots further.The ""flash flood"" riot blast is not that great either, it basically retracts the cps pressure chamber and empties all of it's contents, which hit a grate and spray with pathetic range and a shot time of about 1 second. If you poke the grate out the stream is better. Also mine broke, when i pump it it automatically shoots. i thought this may be good for acting like a blaster that uses a piston-based pressure system, but it shoots about 2 feet. (The Gremlin which has a piston shoots about 40 feet) if you want a good blaster, get an older cps cannon like a cps2000, 1500, or 2100. or get an aquamaster precharger (argon, krypton, or xenon) or a blazer."
1,Shameful vandalism of the super soaker name,"Ive said it several times and ill say it again. hasbro buying out super soaker has been a disaster. They've lowered the market age by at least 5 years with their new pathetic ""soaker tag"" blasters. They discontinued the fast filler, no pump technology which had been newly developed by larami, constant pressure system, and the amazing guns which were coming off the assembly line in 2002. My splashzooka is a reminder of a sad day when super soaker was bought out. I am an addictive super soaker user and have boycotted every weapon produced by hasbro. I tried the secret strike and it stunk. The amount of water in the storage tank is the amount I drink in one chug from 1 glass of water. We can only have hope that it will get better."
3,"Flash flood is a great gun, but breaks too fast",When I bought this gun at the store I thought it was the best one ever. It had excellent power and it is small enought to carry without problems. It breaks easily because something is wrong with the trigger. I only used it for 1week and it broke. If you buy this toy keep the box and recipt you might have to return it. I had to throw it away because it broke. I got the aquapack devestator it was alot better than flash flood. the quick fill cap spills alot. I think it is useless.
4,Unleash the Rampage of FLASH FLOOD!,"I've just got this gun recently, and it's great! The main stream is powerful, and the Flash Flood nozzle, brilliant! I had had a water gun fight and here are the results. 1. I found it hard to pump. 2. The Quick-Fill Cap doesn't work hardly. 3. The main stream didn't look very threatening, but drenched everyone, and dissolved 2 Body Targets. 4. The water capacity (1 litre) lasted. 5. The power unleashed from the Flash Flood nozzle was even bigger than I expected! (That's BIG!!!) All in all the Flash Flood Super Soaker is great!"
2,flash flood is broke,"3 of my freinds got a flash flood and after using its flash flood about 5 times it stopped working. dont get this gun, get arctic shock and freeze your freinds!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,I hate hasbro!!!! There company sucks!!!!!!!,SuperSoaker Flash Flood is a really fun gun. It sucks for dursblety though. Right when I got it me and my brother went out to test it. About the fivth time we used the flash flood lever something went wrong with it. Whenever I pumped it water came out the flash flood nosle without me pressing anything!! Now I am going to get somehting else because of my grades. Please email me if you read this. My email is [...]. I would like to hear what you think of SuperSoaker Flash Flood. Please email to me.
5,Grave Concern is fantastic,I am a big fan of medical mysteries/thrillers. I read everything I can get my hands on. I absolutely loved Grave Concern. I read 90 percent of it in one sitting. I put it down only because I had to. The next morning I couldn't wait to see how it ended. I look forward to Dr. Barnes' next book.
2,Bong,"I think the book lacks a certain animation.It is dry and professorial.The index is voluminous yet, simple wordslike ""narration"" or ""pan"" are missing.I think you could do better!!"
2,Incomplete,"I was looking for a copy of the book on the CD, just as the EXCEL Bible.Trust me, a book on the web does not cut it."
4,Cool Record of the Past,"I like this film. Can't think of any others like it. Written, directed, and acted in by a Chinese-American immigrant, about relations between Americanized Chinese-Americans and Chinese folk in Beijing. The picture on the DVD looks great. In some ways it is more a document of the 80's than the current situation. Beijing of today is not like Beijing of 86 (I was there twice this year). Today, with a more open society and the internet, Chinese people are more knowledgable about US culture than they are portrayed in this film. (Can't say the reverse is true.) One criticism of the film is that it milks a lot of humor by portraying mainland Chinese society and people as quaintly backward (for example, the Chinese computer lab scene). I think that it is somewhat misguided to laugh at a poorer society just because they aren't as hip as our powerful, rich country. Still, I loved this film when I saw it in the 80's and the DVD is worth seeing or having."
4,Good family movie,"Actually got this DVD, A Great Wall, because it has table tennis in it. However, I was more than pleasantly surprised. Not only did I get a new glimpse of China (at the time the movie was made), but it is a very good movie showing the different ways people in different countries live and admire each other's habits. A very good family story involving culture, family, and sport..."
3,Culture Crash...,"The American Fang family is going to Beijing to meet Leo's sister and her family who he has not seen for 30 years. When they meet, both families have preconceived notions of how things should be based on their own culture and they encounter different barriers besides the Great Wall. These barriers are built upon the minute details that are encountered in everyday life along with ideas that people have been taught through their environment. These differences are blown up by presumptions of how things should be base on learned morals, values, and beliefs. The Great Wall presents an interesting idea; however, the film feels forced as the characters seem a little to rigid in their environment. The end result is an average cinematic experience that does not meet up to the expectations of the story."
2,Disappointing Really...,"As I read the reviews, I got excited but upon listening it's nothing much to shout about. This is true specially if you are in touch with the more substantial offerings by Japan's Corrupted or even mid-period Boris.In fact, this is pretty boring (I'm typing as I'm listening to the EP here). I don't hear nothing new. Get any album by Mastodon put it beside this offering and you'll immediately see how pale Pelican is in comparison.I suggest anyone reading to go and get Corrupted's El Mundo Frio (2005) instead and you'll hear true heaviosity, skill and invention. Or Boris' Feedbacker. Or Mastodon's Leviathan. Or even Justin Broderick's own old project Godflesh."
3,Good gift for Penn State fans,"I think this towel is good, but not great. The colors are vibrant and the nap is soft, but its so thin! It would have been a great towel if it was thicker. My husband is a huge Penn State fan though, so he liked it."
1,"Look good, performs poorly","Pros:Good looking towel.Cons:1. Not thick or plush.2. Not absorbent. It hardly absorbs water.Conclusion:I like the look of the towel, but that's about it. I've used it a few times, but have given up on it. Not really worth $23+ shiping in my opinion."
3,okay...but I wanted more,"If you want a feel for bigtime tailgating try ""A Tailgater's Guide To SEC Football"" by Chris Warner. It rocks! (only if you love the SEC like I do!)"
2,Talk About Disservice!,"This review concerns Adam McGill's review of my review of David Blend's book, the one about Tailhook or something (see below). It is rather ironic that Mr. McGill should find fault in my review for failing to mention Mr. Blend's bitchin' afro. Anyone who read Mr. McGill's slipshod review of Christine Northrup's ""Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom"" knows of what I speak. How anyone could review that book without noting that Dr. Northrup is quite a looker for a woman of her age is beyond me. This glaring omission calls into question the helpfulness of every review ever written by Mr. McGill, including his review of my review. Plus, I happen to know for a fact that Mr. McGill has recently taken up with a Republican."
5,"Awful CD cover, but first-rate songs!!!","I like all kinds of music and own almost 2,000 CD's, but if I had to pick just a few of my favorites, this Jules Shear CD would certainly be one of the top five. Beautiful lyrics, lovely melody, great duet vocals,...simply one of the best easy-listening CD's of the last 15 or even 20 years! Sure he looks funny on the cover, but don't let that fool you!"
5,Table,Shipped very quickly arrived with no defects. Product of good quaility for the price. Item discription was very accurate and fit my needs perfectly.
4,Can't beat the quality for this price,"Arrived in good packaging and was far more pre-assembled than I'd expected - all you have to do is attach the legs and the chromed handles for the drawers. Leg attachment is a bit of a pain due to the limited space to work with the included wrench, but the build quality is solid and for this price there's little to complain about. Recommended."
3,Not What I thought It Would Be,"First of all, package was damaged upon receiving; thus, the table was damaged. Some edging on a drawer was broken off. I can repair it, which will be easier in the long run then repacking and shipping it back. Still, inconvenient. The finish on the top is ""inconsistent"" or spotty. It's cheaply constructed and it shows. It's also very hard to put together because of the tiny space given to attach the legs to the table. Put together, it looks alright and it appears solid. But, all in all, not worth the money I paid for it. Quality is suspect."
2,Sofa table,Table looks cheap and much smaller than expected! It's not something I would've purchased if I would have been in local furniture store.
2,I can see why this is discounted so greatly,"This item was a huge disappointment, and I've never been anything but immensely pleased with my Amazon purchases. The table was obviously battered before it even entered the shipping box, as it arrived not only dented, but gouged and scratched. I've done what I can with a black Sharpie to color in the paint that was either scraped off, or was never painted on properly in the first place. I specifically chose this table instead of an extremely cheap one so that I'd have something that didn't look second-hand and shabby. I failed. The only reason I'm not giving it only 1 star is because the size and design themselves are lovely, so if you can get past how battered this will look when it arrives, it is a somewhat acceptable purchase. I just wish I'd known what to expect."
4,Great console table but a little difficult to assemble,"I really like this console and it was perfect for the space I had. However, I found it difficult to assemble as the bolts were in an awkward position behind the drawer track. Other than that I am very happy with it."
4,Great table!!,"I love this table, matches all the other pieces i ordered from various suppliers! Its a very sturdy piece of furniture."
4,Good moral lesson; cute art.,"Creole, the Big Scary Swamp Critter, is shunned by all of the other marsh denizens. Only a fellow misfit--a stuttering alligator who's often on the business end of taunts--will even give her the time of day. How can they win the acceptance of their neighbors?This book is a good and uplifting read for any kid who's ever felt like a freak. And Robin James's slightly saccharine but highly intricate art is another plus."
1,Waste of Money,"I think that this book isn't even worth READING. The recipes are repulsive, and I don't even think that they help you lose wait. The only thing that realy works in my experience is eating right and regular exercise"
5,excellent,"This book, along with Don Mauer's prior cookbook, Lean and Lovin It, helped me lose over 70 pounds. A lot of low fat cookbooks really aren't written by people who like to eat or cook, and it shows. This one is written by someone who enjoys both. These recipes make eating low fat food not just palatable, but a way of life. One note -- a few of the recipes in this book appear to be improvements from the earlier cookbook -- the hummus and cocolate sauce recipes come to mind -- but I'm actually happy to try the variations."
2,Coffee Table Cookbook,"I was looking for a cookbook with a collection of dairy recipes to use up extra milk and other dairy products that we have extra of. I was very dissappointed. The pictures are very ""artsy"" and the recipes are not your practical daily recipes. Only get this book if you would like a ""European-style"" coffe table cookbook."
5,Energizing and lots of fun!,I rented this first and then fell in love with it! Denise is very cheerful and motivating. A great workout in the mornings or for a quick burst of energy!
5,Good price,Got these batteries as replacement batteries for my rangefinder and this is the cheapest price I found anywhere for these. Will buy again.
3,A little concerned honestly,"I ordered these batteries and they arrived 2 days later. Great. However they came in a small manilla envelope LOOSE. No blister pack, nothing to gaurantee that they were even new batteries. There is no date on the actual batteries either. They do work, but for how long? I really hope that they are brand new batteries and they do not die quickly. Be warned, this may happen to you when you get your order."
5,Very good,I love epilators and I can't stand shaving. Braun is very good. My previous epilator is Braun and I have been using it more than 7 years. This one does great job and I love it as well as the old one. Don't hesitate to buy it. Once you get used to epilating you won't look at the shaver again.
4,Not fast but easy,I love this little gizmo and as long as you use it once a week or more it remains pretty painless. Don't let it go then dig into the sensitive parts like the back of thighs or its hurts. I never shave my legs anymore and use this everywhere but my armpits.
4,satisfied,I have been using an epilady for about 25 years (same one) and decided it was time for a new one (cord was getting worn on the old one). The Braun seems to be working very well for me. I had no redness or bumps because I had been using my old coil model on a regular basis. I would recommend this product.
4,"Painful, but works well!","I just got this and yes, like everyone else indicated the cooling glove and a certain attachment are not part of this kit. It is sort of painful, like a waxing, only a little worse. The hair removal is quick. Also, I noticed that many of the hairs are removed on the first pass over the skin, which was great. I didn't want to go over my skin multiple times for skipped hairs, so this product is nice! The light and the blue sparkles on the design are pretty cool too."
2,I wax...This HURTS!!,"I have gotten waxed several times. I noticed that there were still little hairs the wax didn't get. I would go home and tweeze as many as I could with relatively no pain. Well, I thought I was getting tough and could handle doing it all myself at home. I bought this epilator (my first ever) and it hurt worse than waxing. When you wax, it's a quick motion, this thing has to be dragged slowly up your leg. I would have to force my arm to continue up my leg it hurt so bad. It did seem to cut some skin where it raises up around the hair. I even used it on my boyfriend who is very pain tollerant. After it was on his arm for 2 seconds he pulled his arm away. Spend the money to get waxed."
5,Great alternative,Well at first everything was a bit painful but to be expected. The second time barely hurt and the third time not at all. Some sensitive areas pinch a bit. Hair grows back in stages so that might explain why it is less painful - less hair to epilate. Overall this is a great thing to use especially for women that have problems shaving. I was one of those and I am NEVER shaving again. There is a slight problem with ingrowns but if u use a scrub regularly u can get the hair out and that is suppose to pass after a while so will see. I am rather positive about this item.
3,Nice (yet painful) alternative to shaving...,"This product is great, but can be very time-consuming and painful compared to shaving. The plus side is that using the epilator makes my hair grow back every week, shaving makes my hair grow back almost daily so that's pretty nice. Also, make sure you use this after a warm bath. I didn't and it was a lot more painful, even made my underarms bleed a little. owchie!"
4,Holy Moly that hurt!,"Wow! I used this on my legs and underarms and the first time really hurt. After that though, no problem. I've been using it for about a month and it's very effective on the underarms. It's taking a little longer to get to a smooth surface on the legs; however, I have noticed the leg hair is growing in much finer and there's not as much growth. I still wouldn't say my legs are as smooth as a baby's bottom. Definitely exfoliate to prevent ingrown hairs."
2,Disappointed,"I am sorry to have wasted my money on this product. I purchased the Braun 5270 as a replacement for my Remington Smooth&Silky EP-1000 that has served me well for the last 6-7 years of regular use. By comparison the Braun left many hairs even after repeated passes over my legs, and yes, I know how to use an epilator properly. In addition, the construction seems flimsy compared to the Remington model which is no longer available for purchase. I wish I had tried the Emjoi AP-10L with the gold plated feature."
3,OUCH!,i suppose it works...but very very painful if you aren't used to your leg hairs plucked out. i bought it to save money...thinking that was way cheaper than buying razors. its sitting under my sink collecting dust.
2,Not as good as the older Braun epilators,"When I bought this product, I had high expectations. For years now, I've been using an old Braun epilator that I really loved. It was effective that it pulled my hair from the roots and didn't not leave any hair behind. I thought this new Braun epilator would be better. But when I tried it, it wasn't able to pull my hair from the roots. Hence, it left a lot of hair still. I didn't have that ""totally clean"" and ""totally hairless"" feeling afterwards."
4,First time epilator,"I have never used an epilator before, and I read a lot of reviews before deciding. I am pleased with my purchase. I read mixed reviews on this one, but I have found all features to be useful.The light, some reviews said useless, I feel it's very helpful. Maybe it's just my lighting, but I love it!The massage rollers, helpful the first few times on the legs, and still very helpful on the bikini!One stroke removal, not so much with me. I have fine blond hairs on my legs, I have to go over it a few times to get them all. (That's why I only gave it 4 stars) But it could just be my hair, hard to tell as I don't have a comparison.I must confess, I tried the underarms, but it was much too painful for me. So I will continue to shave them.Overall, I am pleased with my purchase."
4,Little pain but worth it!,"You're going to save a lot of money by using the epilator, because in theory is just like going for a wax. The only little inconvinience is the pain you may feel at the beggining but after couple of minutes you get use to it. I think is is worth it to have it!"
4,Great epilator,"I've used braun epilator for the past 8 years, they are the best way to epilate as I personally hate waxing/shaving. I got this one couple of years back. Epilator is the quickest and hassle free product that lasts for years. It only pains slightly, once you have used it few times, its really no big deal. The light is a great addition to this version. Only negative point is the sound it makes, if that can be reduced then great."
5,stick with it,"to start off..I have never waxed or used an epilator before. Having said that, it hurts but really not that bad, just take your time. I was able to do one leg, wait about 1/2 an hour and do the second leg. The next day I did both legs and it was much much easier and less painful. Today I will do both legs again to get rest of the hair. Overall, I am really glad I bought this and I am looking forward to summer!"
5,Fantastic,"Extremely easy to use, and does a superb job. It is small and very well designed to fit easily in the palm of your hand, not like my previous one, which was difficult to hold. The built-in light is very effective, making it much easier to see one you have ""missed"". Well done Braun!"
3,Honest Review on the Braun 5270,"I'll start with the good aspects of this product. First of all, it really does grab a lot of the hair and the bright light does show the fine hairs. The shaver attachment works really good except I hate that it needs to constantly be plugged in to work. I like the design of it, it fits easily in the hand and looks nice. Now for the bad...the so called massaging rollers are actually little tiny spikes that feel almost like they're scratching, oh and as everyone knows...pulling hair out DOES HURT like hell and the body parts you use it on will get irritated...as with any epilator, but there are ways to minimize this problem. The braun 5270 does grab most of the hairs, especially the thick ones, but sadly, some of the fine hairs were left behind and some of the other hairs broke in half. Overall, I'm glad I own this product, however, if I would've tried before I bought, I wouldnt have bought it for as much as it is.BTW never used an epilator before, but I have waxed."
4,recommand,It works. It doesn't hurt much. It is painful to some extent especially for some part of my body. The effect lasts shorter than 4 weeks.
3,works ok but hurts!,"I really want to use this epilator, but find it impossible because I can't stand the pain! Is there any way to maybe numb myself or just any way to make it less uncomfortable? Does anyone else have this problem or am I just overly sensitive?"
3,not sure,I've used it twice and I still have a lot of hair. It seems to break off a lot of the hair instead of pulling it. I know it pulls some though because I feel it. I am squeamish and I don't think this hurts. I actually kind of like the sensation. I hear that if you keep using it it work better and better....I shaved after the last use because I had stubble after using it.
5,tried and true,This is an excellent epilator. I've used epilators for several years and the Braun 5270 is a dependable one.
4,Great product,"Love this product! The little light is an absolute must in an epilator, and it gets most hair on the first pass. The discomfort is minimal once you do it a few times. I you can wax a body part you will love an epilator."
1,pain pain pain!,I was real xcited 2 receive this item n try it out.. i tried usind it different times and giving it a chance but I couldn't take the pain.. not worth what I pay!
5,Braun Shaver Terrific,I ordered the Braun leg shaver for my wife. She has used a similar product for years and she is very pleased with the one by Braun we just bought through Amazon.Jack Abad
3,It is okay....very expensive........,It has a high price tag......Functionality is same as other brand.......it is okay.I would say get a cheaper one cuz all it will be doing is pulling out hairs and getting hurt....
3,Nice epilator for hair removal,"I am rating the epilator a three because it is cute, worked well to remove hair and there was no pain with stubble hair. You will feel snatching prickles if your hair is above a stubble length, not painful but uncomfortable. The longer the hair, the more uncomfortable the feel when the hair is removed. My skin had absolutely no silky or soft feel what so ever. I also had little dark holes when the hair was removed. I returned the epilator because I have better results with creams hair removers."
2,Stubbles,"I bought this product in hopes that it would make my chin smooth and silky, like I read in so many reviews for various body parts. However, for me that was not the case. This left my chin with more stubbles than I have ever had and it left me even more self conscious than I was prior to. Oh well, back to tweezing and plucking!!! Since, I have been able to get the skin smooth again, but was hoping for a quick fix, such as an epilator, but in my case, that did not work. I wonder if I can return this product after use. Minimal use, but nonetheless, use."
2,"I don't think it's pulling the hair, it's more like cutting","I don't think this is pulling the hair out, it feels more like it's cutting it. When the hair grows back in, it looks like it has been cut, not pulled at the root. I used to use EpiLady and that thing pulled from the roots, you felt it and you could see the difference with the way the hair grows back. This seems like it is just cutting it really low. I would not really recommend this product if you are looking for something to replace waxing."
2,Non-stop use,"Yes, this item does work to pull the hairs out at the root and hurts like nobody's business...but I found I had to use the darn thing almost every day for a month! The hairs kept coming and coming. I'd rather spend a lot less time shaving in the shower a couple times per week, than sit on the floor in agony doing this every day."
4,My wife likes it,"I gave this as a gift to my wife.She has been using it ever since, and says its so much better than shaving.I think I like her legs better than with the shaving..."
1,Meh...,"I got this because I was tired of paying all of that money for razor blades. So, my mom and I did a little research and chose this product. It hurt a little at first, but after a little time, it was no big deal. However, this cut my hair instead of pulling it out. I ended up with stubble all over the place and had to shave anyway. I also had a horrible time using this on my knees as it literally ate up and cut the skin on them. After using it for 4 months, I gave it to my mom and told her she was more than welcome to use it. And of course she does, with perfect results. (PARENTS!!!) So, I guess it really depends what you 'hair type' is. Mine grows back fast and is really thick. My moms grows back slower and is really fine. But for me, this was a waste of money."
3,Not 100% Pleased,"This gadget works great on some areas and horrible on others. It cuts some hair off at the roots which leaves a little prickly piece of hair that is too short to pull out. It takes FOREVER to get your legs done. I use it and am not upset that I bought it, but I think I might stick to waxing certain areas."
3,Does the job but very painful...,"I bought this in hopes of eliminating the bumps and pain of shaving. I have a very high tolerance for pain and this was excruciating. I would definitely recommend waxing at least once before you try this. The whole point was to save some money so I did not wax my legs before trying this. It seems to have left the same pattern of red bumps that the razor would, but I rubbed on some pure aloe gel right after using the epilator and it helps calm the skin somewhat. The epilator does not seem to take to lighter hair; it removed all the darker hairs on my legs but left behind the thinner blonde ones. I can tell that there's going to be a need for round two in a day or so to remove the rest of the hair. Bottom line, I would give this 3.5 stars, it does what it is supposed to but if you can afford waxing that is a much quicker, less painful alternative."
4,Get it ladies!!,"Not gonna lie, it's a bit painful but I believe every girl should own this epilator. I have told all my girlfriends about it. My bikini line is finally smooth and bump free. So glad I discovered this product through Amazon and bought based on the good reviews."
1,Sensitive skin beware,"For those of us with sensitive skin, this is not an ideal product. While one can expect an epilator to hurt, especially for someone new to epilation, this one hurts pretty bad. For me, it became somewhat tolerable after a few uses, but I have a pretty high tolerance for pain. Also, people with sensitive skin may experience redness. The first time I used it, I looked like I had a giant rash all over. Not a pretty sight!Overall, this probably isn't a bad product for most people, but if you have sensitive skin, please try another epilator."
5,Best Silk-epil yet,I have been using a Braun Silk-epil for the last 5 years. Although my old one was still working I decided to try a new model to see if it had improved over the years. Wow! The new Braun 5270 X'elle is awesome. It removes hairs with little more that 1 pass whereas the older model took many strokes for the same result. It removes hair much more comfortably - I like the idea of 2 different heads for areas that need a little more TLC. The light is a really nice touch and the look and feel of the epilator is A+. A winner in my book.
3,Not too shabby,"I am a silk epil user since it first came out.IT's not too bad, although i didn't see any real improvement from the last version. I like a lot the little light, it really helps in seeing what you're doing"
3,Thinking about buying?,"When you first start to use, it hurts pretty darn bad. Since it is ripping out your hair over large areas of your body, that should be expected. But once you keep using it, it does not hurt so badly. I have sensitive skin, so when I used it on my legs I was not able to wear shorts the same day. It is awesome to use on underarms. Doesn't take long, and the results last for so much longer than shaving. Also, small areas are easier for me on the upkeep. Since hairs grow at different paces, it is a little hard for me to use on my legs and have them look smooth, especially when you are around light. I don't regret buying this product."
4,Excellent product for good price,"My wife liked it very much... she says it's very convenient and easy to use and it was not much from my pocket :). Additionally it came in 2 days with prime free shipping. So I would say, ""Its cool"""
1,terrible,"The light is great and the power/strength is fine, but the placement of the two rollers is a problem and will not effectively epilate in some places (forced to go at certain angles sometimes to fit) --- only an almost direct/flat application on the face of the rollers will work. Trying to use an edge or one side will not work. Also, the interchangeable cover would not stay in place after a few months and I just ended up using it open top with the rollers fully exposed. Recommend the 1) Emjoi Optima or 2) Emjoi Emagine instead."
5,It's Worth !!!,"It's a great product. If you are looking for an epilator then this one is best. Don't think, just go for it."
3,Okay,"This was pretty good when I got it. It didn't hurt nearly as much as I thought it would (at least, on the calves) but that may be because I'm younger.The attachments started popping off so I just stopped using them.It's also gotten really dirty after a year and I don't know how to clean it. Even cotton swabs can't fit under the spinner. Also, I know a bonus of epilating is that your hairs will start to grow in lighter and thinner. Well, it took a few months before I noticed this and I have to say, they aren't so much getting lighter, but definitely thinner! It can't pluck the thinner ones! This means that, you have to keep razors on hand.Not that you shouldn't even if your hairs aren't getting thinner, because it hurts like *hell* on the underarms/thighs. Also, many hairs won't peak through the skin but will cause your legs to feel bumpy, a razor can fix that as well or if you have like a loofah I think that'd work."
3,If only there was less pain.,"I find that this is a great product in concept. For me, however, the pain is just too much.Pro: My underarm and bikini area was so smooth for almost two weeks.Con: I found that it didn't hurt much on my legs, but didn't leave them feeling as smooth as a razor does.Although, I gained some pain tolerance, the reward was just not enough for me to continue to use this product. Back to the razor for me, unfortunately."
5,Great way to reduce shaving!,"I have dark hair, and I find that I have to shave my legs a lot. So, I bought this item and used it. At first I could only stand to use it for about 20 seconds around my ankles, but the more I used it, the better it got. I now use it on my legs and LOVE that I don't have to shave every day!! This product does exactly what it was built for... removing hair. I now use it on my lip, which does a great job, though it's worth the brief pain of removing it. Plus, you don't have the red skin from hot wax! Great product!"
4,great!,"The light is definitely the best feature, and I love that it comes with a razor head too for when I'm running late and need a quick touch up. Also it's great for the bikini line. The cord is a good length so it doesn't really bother me that it's not cordless - though I hope they do make a new cordless model because that would be more convenient for travel."
4,Good but not great.,"The Epilator's discs are not all metal like the one I used to have some years ago, therefore it seems to me like they don't do as good as a job. It also seems to hurt more than I remembered (I am used to doing the brazilian waxing, so I'm not too sensitive). It still is great for when you can't wait for the hair to grow long to have them waxed. It takes out even the very short ones. I found the light and the attachments very usefull. The cover for the normal epilator keeps slipping out though.Overall I like it, but some of those other ""little problems"" bother me."
5,I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!,"As the other reviews have mentioned... The first time is the COMPLETE worst feeling you will ever experience in your life! I have 3 children and 2 tattoos and the feeling was definitely somewhere in the middle (no lie)! I began by shaving my legs and under arms. Since I was only a shaver and am African American with medium coarse hair, I typically shave every 2-3 days. I therefore waited 2 days and began using my new Braun instead. I continued the same process for about 1 month and have been doing so about 2 times weekly since May. I don't know if it is a ethnic thing or not, but I don't think I will every be every to go long than 1 week or brave enough to go beyond my legs and under arms. The shaver attachments are excellent everything else. OVERALL, the was a great investment!!! GO FOR IT..."
4,Silk Epi,"This is a good product. It hurt like crazy the first time. I had to have someone else do it for me. And, for about two weeks my legs looked awful (ingrown hairs, red bumps), but now I use it twice a week and no problems. It has helped me a lot because shaving was hard for my sensitive skin."
4,WOW It does work!,"I was very skeptical of this product even though the reveiws were mostly good. I received the Braun 5270 Epilator today and tried it imediately. I have yet to master small curvy areas on my upper lip and chin, but even so it worked pretty well there. However the results on my legs was excellent. A little painful at first but I seemed to get over initial shock in a fairly short time. I would reccomend this to anyone who is used to tweezing by hand on the face This is much faster and definately for legs. Waxing is still way more painfull and also on me leaves a skin rippd off effect, which I then have to deal with for days after using. This product did not leave rash or any other obvious side effects to the skin after using. Well thats it I say 4 stars"
4,"Works pretty great, even for a guy.","Well as a guy I needed a way to remove hair, so I got this epilator; who really cares that this is marketed to women, as long as it works!I mostly needed this to remove my neck hair and a couple other places where I had unwanted hair.Worked VERY well. Just wish that the tweezers had a stronger grip, because having thick hair on my neck that's never been pulled out really hurts to have tugged over and over again until it finally gives.Was extremely painful and the tipple or quadruple tugs per hair didn't help much, but hey it works! and now my neck is hair free. Other areas were less painful and I imagine it to go much easier next time around.For a cheap product not marketed for men's hair it worked great.The clipper/razor attachment is pretty neat. The clippers work flawlessly for the most part, and the razor gets nice and close but leaves a lot of patching.Don't be fooled by the low price, get it!"
1,Great until you get ingrown hairs that scar your legs!,"I used this for 6 months and LOVED it! Then I noticed that my legs were getting bumpy. I was exfoliating regularly to try to ward of the ingrown hairs and thought it was working but soon my legs were covered in them. My legs were an unsightly mess for over a year. After not using it for over a year and using every ingrown hair product I could get my hands on my legs look OK. A few more scars to show for it but at least they aren't covered in red bumps anymore. So sad, cause I really did love not having to shave all the time. I know of 2 other people who I told about this when I loved it. They also bought it and had the same problem with the ingrown hairs and had to stop using it."
3,loved it til it died.,"I fell in love with my epilator and have used it a LOT since I got it 2 years ago. It gives great results and features such as the light and cleaning tools that come with it. However, one day recently, it just kind of stopped working at the same level. Now, even though it is plugged in, it barely works and is just going slow motion. I took very good care of it so this is too bad. However, it has been almost 2 years, so I think it still a great product. I will probably purchase another Braun epilator in an upgraded model (hopefully wireless this time!) unless i can figure out if I can get a repair or replacement somehow from Braun."
5,Wife loves it,Ordered this epilator for my wife and she loves it. She says it takes some getting used to of the pain at first but overall it works great.
2,kind of effective but painful,"If you never use this before, imagine use a tweezer to pull hairs. The difference is this is 100 times faster but 100 times more painful because the motor driven roller has built-in mini tweezers. It is common sense. But again, if you have a hign tolerance to pain, it is cheap and can pull where it goes. I gave it three stars due to the pain to the point I quit using it at all.Also, the tweezers need to make contact with hairs to pull. So this is good for hairs longer than 2 mm."
3,Braun 5270 Epilator,it works well and prevents hair from growing back as quickly as when shaved but it leaves skin on legs dry and bumpy.
5,Facial Hair,I bought this to remove facial hair for a longer length of time. It causes a little pain but its worth it not to be pulling out hair or shaving or using creams. This has been a life saver for me.
4,Braun eplator,I use to have one of the original epilators and it finally died....this new one is so much lighter and the light in it makes it so easy...If I knew how good this was I would have replaced my old one sooner.
4,Missing accessories,"The product works fine, but it really came without its accessories, like the cooling gloves and the gentle start head, for example. Since she liked it very much, it thought it would be better to say here its flaws instead of its benefits ( the comment would then be much shorter). Well... the cord could be longer, the noise could be lower and it could come with the accessories its suposed to. Aside those bad things, its a GREAT PRODUCT!"
2,It works but not as well as I'd hoped...,"I am not sure if the product is being more cheaply made now, but after 2 months of intermittent use and being put up in a safe cupboard (ie not dropped etc) it is not working anymore."
4,Not as scary as I thought,"This is my first epilator and I am currently in love with it! I have a high threshold for pain so I barely felt anything when I first used it. Probably just a couple of pinches here and there but nothing too serious. I recommend this if you are looking for an alternative to waxing or even shaving.The only problem I have with this is that it doesn't pick up small short hairs. My legs and arms do not feel completely smooth. Hopefully after two weeks, I can feel a difference."
4,Painless? No.,"There were parts of my body this did not hurt at all, upper thighs, both inner and outer, knees, backs of lower legs. However, the front of my legs in the shin area and the ankles. Wow. My legs were so incredibly smooth. It took about an hour to finish both legs. Now, I have been attempting a Brazilian. Holy mother of God! The pain is unreal and it's bloody. I kept looking to see if it had pulled off strips of flesh, but no, it was all good. I am still working on it. I am hoping the pain will lessen in time. Hairs should be as short as you can get them before you start. Coarse hair seems to hurt about a hundred times worse."
1,midieval torture device,"From the beginning, I knew that ripping the hair out of my body would be painful. I expected that. What I didn't expect is that all those hair folicles would also get inflamed and turn into ingrown hairs (even when I followed all the directions). I stopped using this when I was getting a new scar on my legs (from deep ingrown hairs) every time I tried it. Using it on my neck and chin I looked like I had razor burn. I'm not even going to go into bikini line. For now, I'm back to shaving my legs and using Gigi Brazilian Bikini Wax Microwave Kit for my neck and chin.I hoped I could use the shaver for a while, but it dulled quickly and got really back clogged with baby-fine hairs. This product barely made it 6 months in the house. Wish I hadn't wasted my money."
4,"Good Product, But Hardly Painless!","This gets 4 stars because it was advertised as painless, but is anything BUT. This thing stings. But its effective. If you can stand it, it works well on the bikini area too. And it comes with a handy electric razor attachment to trim any areas you don't want to epilate. Three things to remember when using this product: Exfoliate, Exfoliate, Exfoliate!"
3,If it weren't so painful...,"I don't know how it's possible, but like other reviewers, I find it to be more painful than waxing. It is not just uncomfortable. Maybe it is painless for some, but it is extremely painful for me. But I have lots of very thick hair. Plus the sound it makes is psychologically jarring. I always cringe when it's on! It hurts a little less if you use that Smooth Away product that supposedly removes hair (it doesn't remove much, but I think it gets rid of those tiny, invisible hairs that still hurt like crazy to yank out at the root).If I could feel no pain, i would love it. It is so quick and easy to use every day. Although I always think it's going to pinch my skin, it never has. If you're brave, or have very fine hair, it's great. Otherwise, it just collects dust b/c you're too scared to use it!"
4,Very effective,Smooth epilation. Did not have ny issues with performance or effectiveness. Performed as a Braun product is expected to. Not the cheapest option however worth the money. Much preffered over emjoi epilators.
4,"Good epilator, only a few drawbacks","O.K here is the low down on this epilator:The good:Gets rid of hair for about two weeks (this varies by person)Has a light on it so you can see all the hairs to make sure you get them allVery easy to use, even for a beginnerYou don't have to keep buying more like with razors, creams and waxesThe badIt hurts. Especially in the beginning. If you get through the first time pain it will be worth it. Although, the massagers on this one helpYou have to go over your legs multiple times to get all the hairs, it's not going to get them in one sweep. However, it gets less painful because there's fewer hairs for it to pick up as you go alongEven though it can be used on underarms and bikini you have to be really brave to do it because it hurts 10x worse in these areas. Thus you might still have to shave those areas."
3,"Not that strong, but ok","I owned Philips epilator before, and I liked it a lot. It was very efficient, plucked everything at one or two attempts, no need to go over one area many times. This one is not so efficient, I have to go over one area for 4, 5 times (learned to be patient). Guess these tweezers are not strong enough, sometimes they kind of pull, but not pluck. The ""more efficient"" head I didn't like, my skin gets a rash if I use it. So I stick with ""normal"" one. Takes longer than with my older Philips, but the result is acceptable. The little light is a convenient feature though, very helpful. On the whole, not a bad product."
3,The product is not as good as they say,The product is fine. I am kind of disappointed when I used it. I feel it can't really get the hair out as clean as possible.
1,don't like it,"It scratches my skin, and it is not as fast/powerful as others. I do not recommend it. It took me over 1hr to do both legs!!! When others epilators can do it in 20 or less minutes!"
3,Does not get all,"I go over and over the same spot, in different directions, and it still doesn't get all the hair. It gets perhaps like half of the hairs. However, this thing hasn't broken in a couple years, so at least it's reliable."
4,hurt so good?,"This thing is really loud! I think it's seriously damaging my hearing. But it seems to work pretty well. The one problem spot I have is my knees. I think the hair grows in a bunch of different directions so I have to keep switching the position of the epilator. It hurt pretty bad the first time I used it, and the inner knee area is still the most sensitive spot to epilate. But it's gets easier. I like the light on the front of it. It helps a lot. And I like the regular shaver attachment that comes with it."
3,It's O.K.,"I had the Emjoy and it is trying to die so I bought the Braun due to all of the great reviews.I like the Emjoy better. It does a better job and I use it for legs, underarms and face."
4,A good choice for me,"The hair on my legs is coarse and fast-growing, and I've tried a lot of methods over the years--shaving, depilatories, sugaring, and waxing--to keep it from getting unsightly. So after reading a number of reviews and user comments, I thought I'd give this epilator a try. I've had it for just over a month now, and it's worked well for me. The process is uncomfortable and takes a little while to do thoroughly, particularly the first time or two, but the results are good (especially if you follow Braun's instructions about recommended hair length and skin preparation before you start). Hair regrowth is lighter and the new hair is finer, as advertised, so stick with it."
5,The best Epilator,"I previously owned Phillips Satinelle epilator and thought it was very good. It worked for me for years until wear off, and time to get a new one. I also tried Kenwood ""Emjoi"" model, and it wasn't taking most of hear out. After some research, and reading reviews, I got this epilator about a month ago and it was the best I've ever tried. It saves a lot of time, and I thought it's not too painful even with other epilators, but with this one no pain at all even under arms. I didn't try the roller attachment, just didn't need to, it's probably only for the first time users. The light feature id great, and the best of all I can do it for probably for 1/3 of the time that it use to take me with my old epilator. If anybody looking for epilator, for the first time, of replace the old one- this model is the one to buy. It worth every penny."
3,Good Product! But....,I bought this product based on previous reviews. It does work well and I agree with others that it is painful especially the first time you use it. You do get use to it! I used it only on my lower legs and underarms. The only problem I had was from the ingrown hairs that popped up on my legs. I eventually stopped using the product. I give it three stars due to the price and not being able to use it any longer. :( I suggest seeing if a friend has one and will let you try it out prior to your investment.
3,Still a work in progress,"The good news is this shaver worked wonderful under my arms. There is some pain involved and I noticed I still have to touch up anywhere from one week to 2 weeks later. I'm guessing that it will take a while to get all the hair off my legs and underarms to fully experience the 1 month without shaving as advertised. I like the light feature; very useful. I attempted to use as a bikini shaver but, the pain was too great. Overall, I'm still in the learner curve of this product and maybe once I get the hang of it, I can give it more stars. At this time, given the time it takes to shave with this (much longer than razor) the fact that it doesn't have battery option, the issue with having to go over areas repeatedly, and the pain is too much for bikini area, I have to rate accordingly."
4,Amazing (with a caveat...),"Quite frankly, I was a little nervous about this product due to the multitude of ""it hurt so much!"" reviews. However, I just moved to a house with a pool and need an affordable hair-removable solution that doesn't take all kinds of time (like shaving) so I gave it a try. I was incredibly impressed. Sure, it pinched, but I did not find it intolerable. I didn't need any pain meds which surprised me. I started with my legs, both calves and thighs, but plan to use it in other areas as well.The only disappointment I had was that my legs were not super-smooth the first time. I don't know if this will improve or not, but as a married mother of two that is not my primary concern anyway. They look hair-free so I can wear a bathing suit or dress without an issue. It does not work really well on the super-fine blond hair on my upper thighs, but again, I didn't always shave there anyway!I will definitely be recommending this product to everyone!"
3,"Works okay, but follow directions!","With practice, this product does well for legs. However, it is really too large for other areas of the body, and much too harsh for fine facial hair. It should come with an attachment and a lower speed for more delicate areas, imo.The good news is that it was not the least bit painful for the legs, and I would recommend it heartily for that area alone."
4,First time user,"it's my first time using an epilator. i read other reviews about how painful it can be, but i have to disagree. it feels slightly prickly, but that's about it. it works very well and the attached light was a great idea...it helps you notice even the smallest or thinnest hair. the different attachments are nice. it's kind of loud, so, it makes it a bit intimidating when using it. i'm not sure if it's just me, but i thought it was able to be charged. i found it kind of annoying that i had to have it plugged in while using it. i don't have many complaints. if you hate to shave or wax like me, i suggest you give this a try."
3,Not as great as waxing,"So I got this braun 5270 silk-épil X'elle Body System Epilator and it was alright at best. It does its job. And pretty fast too, I can do both full arms and underarms in about 20 mins.What I don't like about this product is that my hair growth is thicker than normal. I've been waxing for over 8 years and my hair had become very fine, especially on my arms. I could go 3-4 weeks without waxing and my arms looking bad. After I started using this epilator, my hair grows back much thicker and is more noticeable during regrowth. Same with my underarms and legs. Another thing I didn't like, is that I seem to be getting a lot of ingrown hairs now. Which isn't a great thing.Overall its fast, easy to use, not very painful, and easy to clean.Negatives: you need to keep it corded or it wont work. Which sucks if you're not near a power source."
5,Wow!,Fantastic! It even gets the little fine hairs on my thighs!! Waxing couldn't even do that!!! (LOVE the light by the way).
3,Pretty good but not what I expected,"I used to have the old one that hurt like crazy (and i'm good with pain) and I got this one for my legs and underarms so I wouldnt have to shave anymore. So it does a pretty good job- like you can's see any hair but it still doesn't feel smooth like after you shave. Hardly painful on legs but hurts pretty bad when doing underarm. I would still recommend it though since even though skin may not feel all smooth, you still don't have to shave for about 3 weeks :) and it works pretty fast too :)"
4,Great alternative to waxing,"This is a well designed product. It has 2 speeds and a little light so you can see the fine hairs. Its is slightly uncomfortable on your legs, actually just a buzz but other areas are a bit tricky, especially the bikini area. But having waxed there for years, its really not much different. Waxing discomfort is more intense but is quicker. This way is a bit less intense but it not over in one pull. Also, I never had much luck doing the waxing myself. The stuff is messy and its hard to do to yourself. This is pretty easy and obviously much less expensive as it pays for itself after just one session."
4,Best epil' ever!,This is my 3rd. type of eliplator. Over the years I have owned other styles and brands and the Braun 5270 is by far the best. I'm giving it 4 stars due to it not being cordless and rechargable. Otherwise it is perfect. Compared to my older epilady it is virtually a painfree shave and also shaves faster than my old one and it has a light to guide the way. With the guide attached it is pinch free behind knees. I am extremely pleased with this product.
5,I love it!!!,"It's the best epilator I ever had! I really like it!It's fast, light, easy to clean. I never thought that i needed the light on the front but i do! It's so helpful. It helps to see the finest hairs.Trimmer works good.I has all necessary functions. I definitely recommend it to everybody!"
2,Too painful,"I bought this over a year ago and have had to stop using it because it was just too painful. I tried every method to make it less painful and nothing worked. I tried doing small sections and taking breaks, big sections, taking pain meds, rubbing, etc. Nothing worked. I had red spots that covered my legs for days after using. I am going back to regular waxings. They hurt less and the pain and redness goes away in about a day.The light is nice and the electric razor part works well. It would be better if it was battery operated so you didn't have to haul out an extension cord every time you wanted to use it."
5,Glad with my purchase,"This epilator works great, and leaves my skin smooth. It's horribly painful if you're not used to epilating. I still suffer when using it for my underarm. I don't know if I'll ever be used to it!! but otherwise, it's perfectly fine on my arms and legs, not so painful."
3,It does not work all that wonderful,"I had mine for over 1 month now, and I have used this epilator a few times. It did not always pull the hair from root, sometimes it break the hair. It did not either pull all hair or break all hair. I always have to do it again and again. My daughter tried to use this epilator, but it was not working at all for her. Either it was too painful, or it did not even shave the hair. I gave it 3 stars since it is working somewhat for me."
2,Same as waxing.,"Yes it hurts and Yes it works. I though this would be the solution to all my unwanted hair but I am really disapointed because the reason I bought this is because waxing breaks me out and this did the exact same thing! Every spot I used the epilator has red bumps on it that looks like acne and then it turns into acne! I used this on my face and on my lower back, so its either have unatractive hair or have unatractive acne.. I guess you really should just use on your legs but thats not where I need hair removal :("
4,buen servicio,"me lo enviaron a tiempo, y lo uso en venezuela, es muy buen producto, la empresa cumplio con el envio dentro del tiempo establecido, sin problemas"
2,Hoping for better results,"This is the first time I've purchased and used an epilator. Although it was not as painful as I thought it would be when using it on my legs, I was disappointed with how many times I had to pass over the same area. I've tried both beginner and advanced settings. The light was a very nice feature. The main reason I purchased an epilator was to try using it for my bikini line, but that was too painful. I reverted back to shaving."
2,Its okay.......,Dont get me wrong but it hurt like hell. I thought maybe I was doing it wrong at first but I wasnt and it just hurt so bad I had to return it.
3,bruan,JEEESUS H CHRIST! This thing is LOUD! It works ok but I am afraid to use it when my boyfriend or neighbors are home because they might think I'm weed-whacking or something. UGH.
2,Not very silky,"I've been using this product for about 4 weeks now instead of shaving my legs. It has never made my legs feel silky or smooth, the way that shaving did. It cannot remove the very short hairs that irritate me the most, but it does remove the longer, visible growth. So if tiny stubble doesn't give you problems, then this is a good product. But if you're looking for great smoothness, stick to shaving or another hair-removal method."
4,does not hurt so much,good epilator. it does not hurt if you are used to epilators. the probleme is that it cuts some hair instead of pulling them out by the roots.And the rasor does not cut very well.
3,Epilator,It's not as efficient as I thought it would be. It's painful and hair grows back within a few weeks.
2,disappointment,It seems to shave and not pull the hair out. I have the right head on it.Braun 5270 Silk-pil X'elle Body System Epilator
4,Good Choice,"Buy this product for me was a good choice, it works excellent, but if your hair is very thin, this epilator doesn't work well."
5,light at last,i have been using epilators for quite a few years and this is very different than any i have ever used. it really is alot gentler than what i have used. the best part of all is the light. i have found myself in some very uncomfortable positions trying not to miss any hairs anywhere and this simple switch for instant light lets me see every hair in the darkest room. i recommend this epilator for everyone who has ever used a depillatory and whomever is contemplating using one.
4,Wonderful but ouch!,"The product came just as described and I was SO SO thankful that I had read reviews prior to ordering. I knew that it would hurt and used several of the tips others suggested. YES it does hurt a lot but the hair on my legs didnt grow back (with exception to the ones I missed) for almost 2 weeks. I know some people had trouble with their hairs not picking up but I'm very fair and have medium dark hair and it worked just fine. The arm pits are a little tricky since you need your skin to be pulled tight for it to work and wow thats where it really hurt. I would encourage you to use it at night like suggested as I did get red bumps all over my legs. Exfoliating is also super important, I still have some ingrown hairs in my under arms but in time this will go away. Overall I'm satisfied with the product and just need to take the time to do it again.*happy hair removing everyone!*"
5,Excellent Product,"Excellent product. Works as well as all the reviews say. Doesn't hurt not nearly as much as our old epilator. It's fast and picks-up most of the the small and fine hairs. And the light is really useful, even in a well lit room.Highly recommended."
1,Not painless or pain free,I have a high pain tolerance but this epilator is far from painless. Very time consuming to use! Use disposables it's much faster & easier.
3,it's ok,it works fine but doesn't really get all the hair. it does cause some ingrown hair at times. i find that it hurts too much to use underarm (even though the pain of plucking individually doesn't bother me). it's good for the legs and arms. i use it sometimes but went back to just shaving with a razor because it feels like less trouble.
2,chews my skin sometimes!,"this is the first Brown I got & have been using Epilators for 9 years... when the plastic frames is on the roller, there is a cavity between the roller & the frame that once in a while is dragging my skin in and causing the machine to stop & my skin to be red and sometimes bleeding a little! when I use the machine without plastic farms, it leaves light visible scratches on my skin as it moves."
5,Its just just excellent.. no words to praise it,Its just an excellent product.. I am regular waxer from about 10 years and I used this epilator today for the first time. I read many reviews before purchasing it and most of them said it pains a lot when you do for the first time. Truly saying it didn't pained at all on my hands but on legs it pained a lil bit and I think its because the hair growth was lil long. I would definitely recommend it and don't be afraid it won't pain that much. It bearable.. So go for it and ya I find this more convenient than waxing. Thank you amazon for such a good service..:)
4,Worth buying.....,It is a good product to buy and worth the price...I found the in built light very useful...and happy with the seller also. It got shipped at the right time for me :)
4,Hurts so good,"I have dreaded getting an epilator. I was scared of the pain, not gonna lie.But this product, after the first initial shock of the pain, helped me to ease into epilator bliss. I like the fact that it has different speeds so that wimps like me can ease into the world of epilating and can go at pro speed once we're used to it.Only gripe is that it isn't cordless. The bathtub is far from the nearest electrical outlet but it's ok, I'll manage."
3,Not impressed. Not disappointed.,"To be fair, I have only used this product once so far. I have pretty dark, course hair which may be a little too difficult for the epilator to fully remove. It does hurt. Not as excruciatingly as some people have claimed but hard to handle all at once, so expect to take a lot of breaks. The area where the hair is removed looks good, but for me there was still some prickle remaining no matter how many times I went over the area with the epilator...not sure if this will diminish over time, but initially disappointing. I think it's worth the money and I'm hoping to see better results as I continue to use it."
3,It is very good!,I have an older version of Remington and this one has a lot more tweezers and it's faster. Plus it has more heads that can be used for massaging the skin while it shaves from the root. It hurts less than the other one I had. And I think it's because it's faster.
4,Better than razor,If u don't want to wax then u can go for this. This is my first epilator so i can't say this is best or not. But obviously waxing results are best although it is messy/expensive. (Reviewer- Anu)
3,ow!,"This product hurt, badly.You should have a hefty supply of painkillers ready if you want to use this thing"
5,LOVE THIS PRODUCT,"Can't get enough of it, changed my life and my daily routine.At first use my legs were covered in red dots, they stung minimally and were irritate for the next two days. That was the worst of it. Since then the follicles have become less noticeable (I swear I am not caucasian but translucent)and my legs stay fairly smooth with out the need for a touch up for at least 4-5 days. And when I say touch up I mean 3 minutes of my time.My armpits were the trickiest area but the pain wasn't enough to detract me from using it. Having said that the armpit area actually looked the nicest afterward. However, I think that armpit hair must serve some super special secret function because it grows back faster than any other hair.I bought this because I recently bought a wax set from Gigi and lets just say that I am a lazy coward. This hurts significantly less that waxing."
2,"Works ok on legs, but don't use in sensitive ares","I am a veteran user of epilators (over 15 years) and have a high pain threshold, or so I thought. I had 5 different epilators and this is one is the worst. This product is a torture device. It works okay on legs, but when I tried it on armpits and bikini area, I ended up with ugly and very painful scars. The only nice feature that earned the 2nd star is the small light that illuminates the area being worked."
5,Nicole,"Amazing.....It is the best silk`epil I ever have. If you need one ...take one of this, and you will see the diference."
2,Love it!,"I'm updating my review. I haven't even had this epilator a year and it's broken. My previous emjoi last 4 years.I've always used dual-head emjoi products, but thought I'd try to save a few bucks. This Braun is so much better! The hairs don't break, and take longer to grow back. I thought the light was a little silly. But it's wonderful! Helps me see the little hairs I missed. The cord is plenty long."
4,Works Well/Painful,Definitely painful but works well overall. If you want a really clean feel you will probably need to shave after as well.
4,pretty good,"works well, although i did hurt myself the first time trying to epilate my underarms... so if you are not used to epilators, go slow. i found it a bit too hard to clean after use, takes a bit of time to get all the hairs out. had a satinelle before that was a lot quicker and easier to clean..."
5,Love it!,"A friend recommended this product, as she had just ordered one from Amazon... actually, she let me try hers after giving me a glass of wine! Mean! ;)Anyways, yes, there is no way around it- this business is a little painful at first, but esp. if you have already waxed a few times, you should be able to tolerate it. But I am not rating this product because it isn't painful- it's an epilator, ladies. This won't feel great!But it isn't anything intollerable, and I think this product does a good job of minimizing discomfort to some degree.What I am mostly rating this product on is it's performance, tortuous though it may be... It removes hair well. It is easy to clean and maintain,and comes with a cute little pouch.I also like the electric razor feature.I was lucky that I was pointed straight to the best- my sister has been through several different models, and oh, the horror! Why go through all the pain for no gain?"
1,Didn't work.,"I followed the instructions in the box and when that didn't work I followed another reviewers advice. Either way, the hair just broke off and left stubble. It also took too long and was slightly painful.I returned it and got a Panasonic ES2207P electric shaver and that ended giving me a shave comparable to using a disposable razor."
5,I have very thick leg hair,"Ok so normally with shaving, I would have to shave daily...And even that wouldn't keep my legs smooth. My leg hair would grow in so fast and so dark.The epilator KILLED to use the first few times just to get all of the hair off (and I only used it below the knee down to my ankles). I found it helped a lot to take a hot bath before, and maybe an advil an hour before starting to ease the pain. Sometimes I replaced the advil with a glass of wine. I had to use the epilator about every other day for a week and now I only use it every other week. My legs would be super irritated with tons of red bumps. Even though lotion burned, it seemed to help minimize the bumps.When I do use it, I use the massager beads cap first because it isn't as painful. Then I go back and use the closer-cap to get all of the little hairs the other cap missed.Honestly, going through that pain for a week was WELL worth it for barely having any leg hair at all now."
4,Great but my legs are not smooth...,"I first bought a less expensive brand, I thought by purchasing this top of the line model, it would solve my problems. With both brands of epilators, I never did get a smooth leg result as some reviews mentioned. My legs feel like porcupine legs, even after use. I have been using for three months now and followed all recommendations.I have actually had better results with the bikini line area, with no ingrown hairs like I had when shaving. Also, the light is a great plus.With shaving, at least I had one day with smooth legs....If I were single and dating, I would have to shave. Since I am married, with kids, the porcupine feel is not as big of a deal.As far as pain goes...It does not hurt on the legs and only hurts slightly on the underarms and bikini area. I wish it were less noisy so I could watch television while using it."
3,ouch!,"I have very coarse, fast growing hair on my legs and have to shave every day. Getting sick of doing it every day I thought I'd try this technique. Thought about waxing but went this route. I did my homework on which ones were reviewed as the best and bought this one. OH...MY...GOD!!! This thing really does the job it's supposed to do, but I couldn't force myself to finish the job from the pain. The little strips that I could get done all the way looked great, but there was just too much pain. There was no way I could finish the lower leg let alone move to the more sensitive areas like the upper thigh or bikini line. I suppose it's not the machine itself's fault, but I don't think I'll be using it again. Like I said it does the job it's supposed to do but if you can't handle the pain, save the $70."
5,I love it!!,Its great! I took me forever to choose between this one and the philips with the ice thingy. But im so glad i took this one! I had a very bad experience with epilators a long time ago and i was pretty scared!... I almost didnt even felt it. It doesnt hurt that much at all and does the job fast. Really thats a great product! -and its true the light and massage rollers are pretty cool! and its cute!!.. always helps the torture!My only problem would be it doesnt go with european voltage. (but you can buy a converter)
2,BEWARE - Ingrown hairs!!!!!,"This epilator removes hair very well and the pain is not horrible like some have stated. It actually feels kinda cool! The problem starts a week or so after hair removal. INGROWN HAIRS like crazy. I exfoliated every day and still had major ingrown hair trouble! My legs look horrible now. Wasted $. Am going back to shaving. Too bad, because this would have been really convenient."
3,Ouch.,"You may call me a sissy, and maybe you're right.But, anyone who reports ""no pain whatsoever"" is apparently numb!I have been using mine mainly on my chin & neck. It does remove the hair. I want very badly to use it on my upper lip, and I've even tried using a topical anesthetic spray first, but it's just too painful. Maybe if I numb the area with ice first.I can't imagine using it on a large area of body, like the legs, and I wouldn't even THINK about my underarms.Not sure yet if I like it better than shaving.Even though it's WAAAY better than the old Epilator with the spring that pulled out the hairs, I'd say pass on this one if you have a low tolerance to pain."
4,..,"I was so intimidated by all these reviews. When I turned it on, it sounded so painful. I felt no pain at all! It was just a prickly feeling. I've never waxed before, but I naired. Maybe the nair makes the root weaker? I've noticed that after using nair, the hair that grows out is really easy to pluck. There was a bunch of red dots afterwards, but went away quickly. After using it, my legs weren't smooth, but they did look hairless. I'm guessing it snapped the hair off at the end or that it missed the shorter hairs."
2,As painful as the old school Epiladies,"I have a lot of hair. Always have. I look for new better ways to get rid of said hair reguarly. A few years ago, I purchased an excellent well-reviewed epilator machine that worked like a charm until it finally died on me. I replaced it with this Braun epilator, and wow. I had not felt that kind of pain since using the original models of the Epilady about 20 years ago. I don't know what it is about it, but every rotation, ever hair grabbed, is too much pain that one should be having with such a machine. Also, the cord is just too short. I don't know how to return it, but wish I could. It just lays there now, collecting dust. I'll be looking for and replacing with the original if I can, with its completely reasonable pain level and option to go cord-less."
5,The Best Ever!,"If you want to stop wasting your hard earned dollars on hair removal products that don't work, then this is the purchase you want to make. It is by far the best and quickest hair removal product I have ever used. If your can tolerate a little discomfort in getting rid of unwanted hair, like most women do, then buy it and save yourself a lot of time and aggravation. It is not a permanent hair removal system, but it is the second best most affordable do-it-yourself method and beats daily shaving, stinky harsh chemical removal creams and messy sticky waxes. The epil is top notch. I have used it on my legs, bikini line, feet, hands and even the chin area."
1,DID NOT SWITCH ON,Just could not switch it on!Will buy from a department store because this one has the best reviews.
1,OUCH!,Ugh. Too painful to tolerate for more than 3 seconds at a time. Stick to shaving and waxing - this product was a major waste of money.
2,No laser at all...,I thought this device had laser hair removal to it. Mainly because I searched under laser hair removal...Once I got it...I noticed it had no laser and that hairs grow back within three weeks. It says it's like using forty tweezers....This may be good for the legs.... But thats all...
4,AN EXELLENT ONE,"I is not only an epilator but a trimmer as well and really works goooood.It catches the small short hairs that some epilators cannot and isperfect for often usage.I love it,it is my epilator."
1,NOT ALL THAT,I BOUGHT THIS EPILATOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS AGO AND IT WORKED FINE THE FIRST TIME I USED IT THEN I USED IT AGAIN AND THE POWER JUST KEPT TURNING OFF
3,It is O.K,"I got one from Bed Bath and Beyond, then I bought this one because it was cheaper, the quality is good, but I didn't like the packaging, it lack the brush to clean it, and I didn't loke the bag comes with it, usualy Braun has very nice leather bag. bit it works fine, I may go back and buy one from BB&B."
3,mixed,"1st time i used this it was brillant. 2nd time i used it, it was great, 3rd time i used it, it was good. So what i'm saying is...it seem to be getting less effective the more i use it."
2,overrated,"I found this product disappointing. It works well on my armpits but that's about it. The process is incredibly tedious when it comes to the legs and, since my hair grows at different speeds, my legs are NEVER completely smooth. It is impossible not to miss spots as well. So, if I want somewhat smooth legs, I'm having to pull out the epilator every other day, waste alot of time attempting to find new/missed spots, clean up the epilator, vacuum, just believe me..it's tedious. The ingrown hair problem cannot be overlooked either. I've gone back to shaving my legs b/c it works better and is less annoying. Yep, it sucks to be a girl."
3,Worked ok...,"I bought this epilator in April 2007 - it was my first epilator, so I didn't have anything else to compare it to at the time. At first I thought it worked decently well - I hated having to shave every day and the idea of only having to epilate only once every couple weeks or so appealed to me. The problem with this epilator is that it would take me well over an hour to get both of my legs done. Also, I had tons of ingrown hairs, which I bought several different creams/lotions to help remedy (without success). I was determined to continue epilating, though, to avoid having to do that daily shave. In October 2011 I decided to try theEmjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilatorand for me, this one was leaps and bounds better. My epilating time was cut in half and even though I still have some ingrown hairs, there are not nearly as many as I had with the Braun epilator. Based on my experience, I would recommend the Emjoi over the Braun."
5,Made In Germany,"I ordered this product for my wifeThere was discount on this product at that time, maybe 50%This product works only via electricity, no batteriesBest Features Of this product :1- Power Cord Cable is long2- The light positioned to the target area of epilation3- Made In Germany"
3,Ingrown hairs galore!,"First of all, your hair should be long enough before you even attempt to use this...but even if your hair is the optimal length, I would say that this epilator will successfully pull out from the roots, at most, 60% of your hair. The rest it just cuts, similar to shaving, so regrowth time is comparable with shaving.Another down side is the amount of ingrown hairs it gives me. I have tried waxing before with lasting results but because of my skin and leg hair type, I've always had problems with ingrowns. I don't know what I was thinking when I bought this with the belief that my ingrown hair problem would vanish magically. After all, the concept of pulling out hair from the root was the same with both.All in all, it had the same problems of shaving and waxing (fast regrowth and ingrowns respectively), but to a slightly lesser degree. It takes longer than shaving but is quicker than at home waxing. For me, this is just an OK product. Expect no miracles."
2,Not Meant for Blondes,"I recieved the epilator and decided to return within the same day. I bought this because I wanted longer lasting smooth skin. I have blonde hair, but I read some reviews saying that it worked on blonde hair, but alas, no. I ran it repeatedly over the same spot, but it didn't lift the hair. The pain wasn't too bad (but maybe that's because it wasn't working?), and I really liked the smart light, but I could never imagine using it on the bikini area. Definite cons - the the noise! and the short cord. It would have been even better if it was a wet/dry type one (and if it worked on blonde/soft hair)"
3,good product for right type of hair,"this epilator works great on course hair, but not so great for thinner, finer hair. it worked great in my calf/shin area where the hair is slightly more coarse, but as it got up around my thighs where my hair is thinner the tweezers have difficulty grabbing at the hair. works GREAT on underarms but it is a wee bit painful the first few times. you get used to it tho. have not tried it anywhere else but legs and underarms."
4,easy to use epilator,"I purchased the Braun Silk-epil a couple of weeks ago. The first time I used it was very painful, but you get used to it and after a couple of times it get less painful.The result is ok. Some of the hair is only cut off instead of removed by the root. I have to use the silk-epil at least once a week to have smooth legs. I tried but can't use the epilator other than for my legs.The usage is super easy and it is a high quality product."
5,Excellent,"My order was processed same day (althogh it was a Sunday), and my epilator came within three days after the purchase. The Braun 5270 Silk-épil X'elle Epilator works great. It has exceeded my expectations. It is worth its money."
4,Exactly as reviewed,"Other good reviews for this product helped to make up my decision on this product. I was hesitant with all the too-good-to-be-true commentary, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was true. Its the best time saver purchase I've made in a long time."
3,Just OK - so far,"I've been using mine now for about 3 weeks. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to get all the hairs and, so far, I'm still having to use it every day, so right now I don't see that it is any better than shaving and it certainly takes a lot longer because you have to go over and over the area. It may be OK if you have really straight hair, but if there is any variation in the way your hair grows, it doesn't seem to work well. I'm also having a problem with ingrown hairs, even with exfoliating."
4,Best buy for the money and for the job!,If you are used to waxing no problems. It takes some time to get used to it but worth it for the results. I did a lot of research and this is one of the few Epilator you can you for bikini and works awesome.
5,long time epilator user,Longtime user of 15 years - this epilator is by far the best I've ever used. I've read some reviews and some complain about pain and to those people I suggest using it right out of the shower when your skin is more pliable. I love the variable speeds. Being a skilled user I hated it when some models started putting 'protection' in for the unskilled user. Those models did not work on me I have some pretty stuborn hair!
5,Best alternative to waxing and shaving,"This thing is awesome! I think the thing that surprised me the most was how well is gets very short hair. You don't have to let it grow out for a couple weeks before hand like you do when you wax. I go the gym 3 times a week and don't want to be hairy as long as it takes for waxing to be an option. It was able to grab on to hairs after not shaving for two days. It even gets the really fine thigh hair that waxing can't get.Yes, it hurts but it hurts less than waxing since you can get the hair as it grows and not have to rip everything out all at once. If you have waxed in the past it feels about the same as shaving with a dull blade. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is tired of shaving every day and doesn't want to wait for the hair to grow out enough to wax."
4,It saved me waxing expenses...,"I only use this for my underarms, and I think it's great because I pay $12 for waxing every time I go to the salon. I don't use it for my arms or legs or anywhere else so I can't really say, although I'm guessing it is pretty painful... It also has a razor head so that's another option. I like it... :) I honestly think it's worth the money, and this is pretty good coming from me who can be pretty stingy. I also love that it has a mini pouch to put everything in. :)"
5,I am very satisfied with the product,"I bought this Braun epilator from Amazon, I am very satisfied with it and it is realy my best choice. I recomend it, it realy does a great job."
5,Braun Epilator,"I purchased this epilator with some hesitation because the last two brands I have purchased haven't worked very well as the very first epilator that came out in the 80's. Well, I have been pleasantly surprised. This epilator actually works and works well. I am very happy with this product."
3,just OK,"I've been using this epilator for a few months and I can't say it is anything special. I only use it for my legs, and the hair grows back in 2 to 3 days, not 2 to 3 weeks. Prior to this, I used an Epilady coil epilator for several years (it finally wore out) and it did a better job, with about 2 weeks between uses. Maybe the Braun breaks most of the hairs instead of getting it down to the root. I don't know, but for my dark hair the Braun doen't work very well."
1,ouch,Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!!!! Did I mention ouch? This is one of the most painful things I have ever experiences and it didn't even get all the hair.
5,Excellent,Braun 5270 Silk epil X'elle is the first epilator that i purchased and is one of the best hair removal strategies that i have ever used apart from waxing since it takes your hair out from the root. Through epilation it usually takes 2-4 weeks for the hair to grow again. This product arrived exactly in time as per the Amazon 2 day prime shipping.
5,Worth the discomfort,"I'm not going to lie - there is pain involved. But if you have an average level of tolerance for discomfort you should be ok. In my opinion it is totally worth it to have smooth skin for weeks after! If you're prepared for the noise (it's a bit loud) and the discomfort, and would like to not have to shave all the time, this product is a great choice."
4,Good product for the price,"If you love the benefits of epilating, this is great addition to your beauty arsenal. I use this every 4 or 5 days and shave after to get the smoothness we all love. It last for days and is pretty painless (or maybe I'm just used to it)The light (which I thought was a superfluous feature) actually does help you see the finer hairs. Plus there is a shaver included as well when you don't feel like being uncomfortable AT ALL. Happy epilating :)"
3,Not an easy solution,"I'm struggling with this epilator. As mentioned by others, it's true that epilating is not a pain free option for hair removal, but I think the pain is minimal on the legs and not bad on the underarms. It's more painful than waxing for all areas, but particularly the bikini area, and takes much longer. I find that it doesn't pull all the hairs out cleanly, so I'm left with some broken hairs that create stubble. I do use it on the bikini area (although some areas are really painful) and I'm getting a lot of ingrown hairs which I never get with waxing. Other reviews have said to persevere, so I'll give it a few more tries, but I'm not ecstatic about it - it's just a cheaper option than salon waxing and less messy than if you do home waxing."
2,Doesn't work well,"Based on all the positive reviews, I decided to get the Silk-epil to see if it was any better than my Emjoy Optima and it's not. It was a big disappointment. Whether using it on the epilator setting or on the shaving setting, it misses the majority of my hairs which makes it a waste of time and a waste of money. And I'm not new to epilating, so I know how to use one and what to expect via results.It could be that I got a defective product but some how I don't think so. My advice is to skip this one and go for the Emjoy Optima."
4,I love this product,"When I first got the epilator I was very scared to use it. I tried it out and for the very first use it felt like I was being zap by electricity. I then took out the razor attachment that comes with this epilator, shaved my legs and tried again. Once the hair on my legs was relatively short there was very minimal pain. I epilate now evert 2-3 weeks with little pain. I find this product to be one of the best investments that I have made. I have not yet tried it any where else on my body but I also don't mind shaving other areas that are more tender everyday (especially my arm pits). I would recommend this product to a friend and I think if you are tired of shaving every other day like I was, then this product is for you."
2,It costs less than a nono,I think this product does an okay job. One thing I dont like is that I still have red marks on my legs where the hair was torn out and that was a week ago. Maybe it will just take some time for my skin to get used to it. I sure wish I could afford a nono (an at home laser hair removal system) though.
1,Perfect for your worst enemy,"This was definitely not designed by a woman. I have never experienced this much pain, I have 3 kids and tattoos all over, but the pain this caused is wayyyy worse. Just imagine 40 pairs of tweezers pulling the hair from your bikini zone all at once. OUCH!!!"
3,Expect ingrown hairs!!!,"Ok, I've used this for months now and I can say it can really take a lot of hair off easily...BUT I've had horrible ingrown hairs and I hate them so much! I used the epilator to smoothen out my skin making it hairless and flawless... my hair legs are just thin and after I've used this for the first time.. guess what? my thin hair just turned into thick coarse hair! I have no choice but continue to use it since I can't stand the thick hair on my legs...but what I hate most is the ingrown hairs that bumps on my skin which is so itchy and irritating! I am now looking for a better hair remover... I'll say no to epilating if all epilators would cause this!"
4,great product,it is great product i bought for my wife. she like this much better than regular shaving blade and i would definitely recommend this for others
4,Not silky smooth...,"For someone that has never used an Epilator, this is very painful. I took the advice of some other reviews and tried to use it right after showering and it was still very painful. The pain did decrease a lot when I used it a second time. If you prefer a very smooth, freshly shaven feel on your legs, this doesn't cut it. The hair was gone after using it, but my legs just weren't super smooth. This is a good product if you can't shave for an extended period of time, so I'll probably suffer with the pain occassionally when shaving won't be convenient. The trimmer and electric shaver feature, along with the built-in light make the product worth the purchase for me."
5,Pleasantly surprised,"I just got this a few days ago in the mail. I purchased it after seeing all the rave reviews about it. The only real concern I had was the price, and was worried it wouldn't be worth it. Boy was I wrong. I am now throwing out my shaver, wax kits, bleachers, etc. I love that you can use it anywhere on your body. Used this to get rid of the peach fuzz around my belly, bikini line, underarms, and legs. It does sting a little bit at first, but hopefully I will get used to it."
4,Sure it hurts... but only in the beginning,I bought this product a few months ago and have used it several times since. It hurt my legs at first but it gets a little better every time I use it. The bikini and underarm areas hurt a lot more but I just try to use it for a few seconds every few days with the hope that the pain will lessen as time goes on.The indicator light works great and really helps you see the hairs your removing.My only complaint is that it's not cordless. It can be a little awkward dealing with the cord and trying to get the hard to reach spots behind your legs.
4,It beats shaving,"My skin is very dry and the first time I used this, I actually drew blood! Just little spots here and there, but totally annoying. I've learned my lesson and now use it after showering (as recommended in the instructions). Yes, it hurt a lot the first time, but it definitely gets better. I still haven't achieved total smoothness but I'm hoping that will happen over time. Right now, I still have a mild stubble but it's not visible. Overall, I'm happy with it - it beats shaving by a mile."
3,Its okay. Ingrown hairs beware!,"It felt a little prickly the first few times I used it. It did reduce the overall amount of hair and became easier to use over time. However, I started noticing I got ingrown hairs. I tried exfoliating, but i continued to get them. If you are typically prone to them, you might reconsider. I can also say that I never was able to use it under my arms with much success."
5,Best Silk-epil Model ever!!!,"I have been Silk-epil user for 10 years now so have seen all their models but this one is the best ever. I love the increased number of tweezers..means more hair removal in less time & with less pain, also the light is great, actually helps see the shorter hair. It's definitely way lighter than the older models & somehow pain-free, love the product but DON'T buy it from AMAZON.The product condition was quoted to be ""new"" but Amazon.com send me a USED one or probably was a customer return. In any case, the box was already opened when I got it, 2-3 scratches on the machine...worst part...there were some hair stuck in the tweezer head & that's when i knew it was used! I have never had this bad experience with Amazon before but I don't think I will be buying from this site again, Plus the product is available at a no. of other places. Goto the official site & it will show you where you can buy it from."
5,Good Product,"I bought it as a birthday gift for my daughter, and, after a couple of initially painful sessions, she is happy with it. She says it is good for the legs and the bikini area but too painful to use on the armpits though."
5,This is great!,"This product is great. In the long run cheaper than waxxing and it last very long. I have built up an ability to use on my stomach, calves, and knees. Working myself up to thighs, bikini line and underarms. The good thing is that until I do --- there are various attachments that can be used so you can use as an electric shaver."
4,quite nice once you get over the pain,"I've used this product several times now and for removing leg hair, it works nice. I have to go over areas a couple times, though, so to get through the lower legs and knee I usually have to set aside a good 10 to 15 minutes to get it done. The inner and upper legs can be a little painful. I tried using it on my arm pits and bikini line and it hurt like a mofo. I will stick to shaving those areas.It would be nice if it would pick up every hair in one swipe, which is my only complaint on the product. Still, it's a good alternative to shaving and I can go a month or so before I need to epilate again."
5,Best Ever,This was replacing an older model - at least 10 years old. I love the way it works and this model has a light. Love the product and recommend it to all.
5,works great!,"I love this epilator! I was a consistent waxer before, and I love being able to get the shorter, sparser hairs as they grow in, instead of waiting for ""enough"" long hair to make waxing again worthwhile. This is my first epilator, and I'm SO glad I got it! I don't think the pain is as bad as waxing- I use it on my legs and underarms. It will pay itself off shortly as well."
3,it's okay but....,"i had an emjoi which was much better. i read all the reviews for this one and i went for it. it definitely is not as good, but i kept it and will use it until it gets old, but i when it does i will buy an emjoi."
5,Just Fabulous,"This epilator is by far the best I've ever used. It's perfect in every way possible. The smart-light is wonderful. The machine itself is fast and efficient; easy to clean and use. After the first use, the process is quick and painless. Before making the purchase, I was worried that this epilator would be TOO efficient for my rather sensitive skin, but it really hasn't given me any problems. You'll never have to shave or wax again! :D I absolutely love it."
4,awesome,"i recently got this epilator. i've never used one before, but i have tried waxing. i dont have much luck with trying to wax myself, and i especially hate having to grow it out long enough to wax.i have 2 tattoos..and this hardly compared to the pain.gave it four stars because of all the attachments...its kinda overwhelming, but i'm sure after i get familliar with it, it won't be a big deal.it comes with massaging head, a trimmer and a convenience attatchment for people who are used to it, a cord and a bag that holds everything.also...it has a pretty color! lol. the spotlight is not optional. it kinda reminds me of the light on a vacuum cleaner."
3,Good for legs only and very noisy,"When I bought this product I was looking for something that would remove hair from my legs and underarms but unfortunately it has only worked on my legs. I have to go over the area several times for it to remove all the hairs. This machine is quite noisy and it would be better if it were cordless,"
4,Simply Awesum!,"This is my 1st Epilator. Read a lot of reviews and researched through plenty on Net, and i should say i was a bit scared to use the epilator de very first time. But i was pleasantly suprised. There was very little to no pain, when i used it on my legs and hands. The bikini line and under arms wer a bit painful. But then they are sensitive area's and my hair growth had thicken'd there due to shavin.Another gr8 feature is the shaver head. For those places where you think you'd rather shave, you've got an amazing shaver head. I have given the product 4 stars , not cause i wasnt satisfied but would have loved it 100% if it was cordless.To Summarize : Great product ! Economical ! Bearable (to no) Pain !"
5,Why did I wait,"I was nervous about getting an epilator because of all the pain people talked about. I finally got sick of shaving and decided to try it. I did it on my legs first and couldn't believe it! Sure you could feel it, but it was nothing like I expected. It kind of feels like getting a tattoo! I don't think I would describe it as pain! I did also do my underarms and bikini area. They were painful, but nothing a determined woman can't get through! It is worth it if I don't have to shave for three more weeks!"
5,Terrific Product,"It did take a few trys to get a hang of this product, but once I did, I love this product. I have been using Epilady for 17 yrs, the one where you have to move in a circular motion. I switched to Braun 5270, I was so impressed. I love the little blue light and the fact I don't have to go over and over again to the same area is a plus. This picks up the tiniest hair in one smooth stroke."
2,doesn't work,"Bought this product because of some so called ""good"" reviews. This epilator quite simply does not remove hair easily. In order to remove the hair, it must be pretty long and I found that I had to go over the same area repeatedly. It's just not that good. Don't waste your money. Amazon was great in allowing me to return this product and get a full refund. GO AMAZON!"
5,love it!!,"finally found the american version as my european version doesnt work well and thus wasn't in use anymore. this new version is great with razing and epilating options and the light. i love not having to shave my legs so often anymore and having smooth legs still... pain factor for me... hardly any, but I guess cause I was used to it quite a few years ago. luckily it hasn't changed."
5,best hair removal that i have used,"1st time epilator user....i have fine hair and was skepital as to the effectiveness of this for me....wow am i glad that i was wrong. this thing works very well...i was afraid that it would be painful; but, i think that this would compare to accupuncture. it does sting just a bit the first time on sensitive areas; but, when i used it on my legs it felt good. my hair is growing much less as i go along. another user advised bathing and buffing skin to help hairs stand up which definately helps expand time between need to epilate again. i also used the after cream recommended for hair reduction and irritation reducer. i think any lotion will work.i chose this model because of shaver head((i was afraid that i wouldnt be able to use the epilator for various reasons and this would be my backup)) and i have used it a couple of times and it works really well especially on underarm curves.i definately would recommend this epilator/shaver."
4,Ouch!! But hey - no pain no gain!,"First off, I'm a guy and bought this Epilator for my chest, back and stomach area. I shaved, waited a several days and then had a go with the machine. Talk about pain, but it was bearable and the results were excellent. Like many others have mentioned you'll develope a rash shortly after that fades overnight. It's easy to see how it's to be used, I haven't read the instructions yet...it's guy thing. In hindsight, I wish I had opted for the rechargable version."
4,First Time,"I just purchased this item, and have since used it once. i had never used an epilator before, and decided to try this one specifically since I have heard great reviews. I COULD NOT wax, it is too messy and painful for me.. shaving is a hassle, and my skin is very sensitive.for any in a similar position- i have found this product to be a God-send!PROS:gets rid of hair/ grows back thinnernot messy.bang for buck.CONS:it is painful at first...however, not unbearable. i prefer this to wax any day.does not get rid of all the little hairs, even with the useful light attached. quick fix: use in sunlight!OVERALL: great way to get rid of unwanted hair."
2,Does the job...but does it badly,"Yeah, it epilates...but I found that it would grab my hairs and my hairs would break in the middle instead of being pulled by the root. What a disaster. It hurt like a mofo too."
1,Not for guys...,"First off, I'm a guy who happens to be extremely hairy. I end up spending 70 dollars a month to get my chest and back waxed in order to keep the wife happy and from calling me 'Wolf Man'.My wife ordered this product thinking it would be a 'fun' (by fun I mean getting the chance to torture me), and inexpensive way to remove my excess body hair.I did all of the proper prep. I took a hot shower, and ensured the hair on my chest and back was trimmed using a Wahl trimmer. The first pass of this thing on my back was unbearable pain. The second pass on my chest wasn't any better, and I put a stop to it after that. Of course my wife is rolling on the floor in laughter at my pain and excessive use of profanity.I ended up returning this product, and will just stick with waxing once a month.I have a whole new respect for women, and what they go through in order to stay beautiful."
5,I don't know why people shave!,"I had been shaving for a good long time, and then in an effort to make life simpler and more hair free I got one of these Epilators. I was a bit nervous since the idea seems painful but I tried it out the afternoon it arrived and it was not painful at all. I know that sounds like it can't be true, but on my legs it really is not painful. I then tried it on my bikini area. It was a bit painful there understandably, but not enough to stop me from using it again a few weeks later on both my legs and bikini. It is great to not have to worry about shaving every other day and this is much faster since it does not involve a bath or shower. The light is really handy, and the little brush is great for cleaning it out when you are done. I know some people complain about ingrown hairs but I have been using the epilator for about four months and I have had a total of one ingrown hair. I seriously don't know why people shave."
4,not bad,"Good speed, the light is not very convenient and unfortunately can't be turned off, not completely painfree, but close, a bit loud, but most epilators are, definitely improved performance compared to the previous Braun systems."
2,epilator,"I bought this braun 5270 and I thought I made a good choice but I was wrong.It doaesn't do its job very good leaving short hair behind. I don't recomend this product to anybody. It was a gift and the person didn't like it, she said philips are better."
4,Less painful and Better than waxing ur legs and arms,"Less painful and Better than waxing ur legs and arms,leaves the skin so smooth for days.i couldnt even feel anything while epilating my legs and arms ,but epilating my armpits was painful might be bcoz the skin is loose in there,so cannot use in the bikini area,but this is the best solution for the hair in legs and arm ,its quick it took only 30 min for legs and arm."
3,"Highly effective, extremely painful!","I have been using this epilator for years now, mainly because its the only thing that really works, other than tweezing, which just takes too long. It usually takes me about 10 mins, and I use it about every 4-6 weeks.However, the downside is that it's extremely painful! I cringe every time I have to use it, because i know how much it's going to hurt. Then after using it, I get red bumps on the sensitive skin of my neck/ jaw line, which lasts about a week! It sucks breaking out in a rash, but it's better than having facial hair!Overall, I would recommend it just because it works so good, but beware of the pain, and don't buy if you have very sensitive skin."
4,Works great!,"I read all of the other reviews before purchasing this Braun 5270 Epilator. The majority of the reviews referenced the pain involved, especially during the first use. So, I was expecting the worst, but the pain was actually more of a discomfort. It helps to pull your skin tight, and also to make sure the hair on your legs is standing up by rubbing it the wrong way. The 2-week duration of the epilation is overestimated - I found that I need to use it once a week or so. However, the write-up said that when the hair grows back, it is finer and lighter, and that is true. So far, I have only used it on my legs, even though the literature says that it's safe on bikini area and armpits."
3,Owww!!,"Bought this as gift for my daughter (who really wanted one!). She says it works great but ""Hurts so much, it's evil!"" It is supposed to get easier as time goes by---the jury is still out on that one!"
4,I should have gotten this sooner!,"This product gives excellent results, leaves your skin silky-smooth. But i would suggest for the stage when the hair starts to grow back, you should have a skin solution that prevents ingrown hairs."
3,"product works great, but...","After hearing so many great reviews (and reading them online as well) I decided to buy the Silk Epil. It definitely hurts for the first few times you use it, but then the pain lessens, and it is highly effective at removing hair. I was thrilled with the results at first, but after a few weeks I started getting ingrown hair, which has never been a problem for me before. I bought a ""Bump removing"" lotion, which helped a bit to lessen the ingrowns, but I ultimately stopped using this product because of the hassle of trying to deal with this problem. too bad-- it is a great product, and I was so happy to not be balancing on one foot in the shower anymore, trying to shave! I may try it again, but it was an expensive product, and ultimately not worth the trouble for me. OH-- and I don't recommend it for bikini line: It is WAY to painful for that!"
3,It only holds 110v electrical power,"I'm really pleased with the epilator, the poblem ocurred when I travelled to the UAE where the source power is 220v, even though I used a converter from 220 to 110, the epilator just burnt.Please be aware of the power source."
5,great job for the price! Cant believe I was without this for so long!!!,Does a pretty good job... Tried it on my legs and did a fantastic job! Couldnt get it to work on my face due to large head... underarms were too painful... Will stick to my hands and legs with this...
1,My legs look like a horror movie.,"Well, I used the product for several weeks very happily. After that, I began getting really disgusting ingrown hairs all over my legs. I mean... ALL over.That was March 2010. It is now February 2011. I still can't wear skirts or shorts because of how horrible my legs look. They're still covered in ingrown hairs that can't be cured by any amount of exfoliating, lathering in lotion (3-5 times per day). I've seen a dermatologist and he's given me medicated lotion. No avail. I just want my legs back!! This is a horrible, horrible device, DO NOT BUY."
4,It's been 2 years...,"I like it for the most part. But it does have trouble pulling out thin or short hairs. I use it mainly on my legs and underarms. Personally, I think it is way too painful for the bikini area. XDAs for ingrown hairs, you will get them no matter what...always make sure to use moisturizer and exfoliating scrubs afterward."
4,Excellent Product,"This is an excellent product! I used to work in a salon, so I had originally intended to get a waxing setup, but after reading reviews I decided to give it a try. And I am very glad I did. It works every bit as well as wax without the mess! My underarms have never been smoother!In terms of pain, it is definitely a different sensation than waxing, but I don't think it was worse. I found that keeping the skin taught helped. When doing my lady area, holding my breath helped too. However, if you can't stand the pain of waxing, you probably won't be able to stand this.I am very glad I bought this. It is quick, clean and portable, all the things that waxing is not. :)"
4,Great Alternative to Shaving,"The positives have all been stated, so I'm gonna go with the negatives:1. it's really really loud2. It's difficult to clean3. Lots of little parts are difficult to keep track of4. One of the plastic parts already broke, but totally still usable"
5,"Yes, this is not for the faint of heart, but it is awesome!","I read so many good reviews on this product that I decided to try it. The first time I used it I could only do half a leg with the started head attachment and on low speed; My God, it Hurt!!! The next day I tried the rest of that one leg and the other one (sounds like I am an octopus) and it wasn't as bad as the first day. By the time I finished I was using the more advance head attachment. So, yes, it hurts at first but once you get a hang of it, is not that bad.The hairs do not grow back as quick as they do when you shave and they come back thinner. Those of us who shave (or used to) know that once the hairs start growing back, they all come out at once and even all around, well with this epilator they do not. You will not get a leg full of hairs in 2 days, but a few hairs here and there in about 5 days or so.Overall, I am very pleased with this product!"
1,MONSTROUS issues with ingrown hairs - BEWARE!,"I purchased this product in May 2009, as an alternative to waxing. I was using it every six weeks or so, and by the end of the year, my legs had turned into this monstrous web of hairs growing under a thin layer of skin. The ingrown hairs cause bumps, sometimes become infected and as a result, my legs are all scarred with dark spots everywhere. If I need to wear a skirt, I need to apply leg makeup even under pantyhose.I have olive skin with medium dark hairs, and I don't know if my type of skin has a tendency for ingrown hairs. If you are going to buy this product, test first... or you will risk paying $60 on the epilator plus $100 on creams and lotions, a couple thousand on permanent hair removal (which does not entirely solve the problem) and a few other hundred on skin treatments to minimize the scars."
4,Very pleased with this product! Minor cons,"I have had my Braun epilator for just under 6 months. I am very please with it, I love not having to shave every single day. I epilate once a week, the first time it took well over 2 hours to do it because of the pain and getting used to it. Now it takes an hour for both legs. In between full hour epilating I do go over small areas needing touched up. I gave it 4 stars because it would be nice if the cord were longer and if it had an attachment to catch the hairs. Other than that I am very pleased with this product!"
2,Very noisy,"I bought it accoding to its higher review value. Now regret.Itself looks nice, but Very noisy! Always break the hair into shorter, instead of get it out.Won't recommed it!"
2,It's iffy,"I heard really great reviews for this, but to be honest, I wasn't completely satisfied. I was ready for the pain, that wasn't really a big deal. But if you are thinking about buying this product because of the little rollers; DON'T-they're useless and scratch your skin. Also, it felt like it was cutting the hair rather than actually pulling it all the way out, because I have had to use this everyday for nearly two weeks and my legs are still not completely smooth. The shaver is useless as well, even if I went four-five days without shaving, I'd still be smoother than I would with that thing. I'm really not impressed-I expected a LOT more out of this than what I got. The reviews were what persuaded me into buying it, but I was very dissapointed."
2,ugh,"i'm not a review writer, but wanted to say that this epilator is awful. i've been epilating for years and years... it is much better than shaving, hair grows back much slower and much thinner over time. HOWEVER, this machine is awful. it definitely gets rid of the hairs, but mostly be breaking them at the base, and not by pulling them out from the root as it should. i might as well be shaving since the hair grows back right away. definitely would not waste your money with this machine."
5,the best epilator!,"I love this epilator! I ordered it a few months ago after reading mostly positive reviews and I love it. The first time I used it, it took me a while to do both legs, it was really painful. After that first time, it's cake, doesn't hurt at all. I used to have to shave my legs every other day and I don't have to shave them anymore! The hair grows in very fine and with less frequency, my legs are so smooth, compared to that second day stubble I used to get. The only drawback is that it is really loud so I can't do it at night."
5,Say good-bye to your razor!,"This product is wonderful! For someone who has always struggled with shaving and course dark hair, this product solves everything. Now granted, this doesn't come without pain, especially the first time you use it, but now I'm doing weekly maintenance & for the first time, I have ""clean"" underarms!"
3,Why?,"Robert Jordan's ""The Great Hunt"" is a great book, undeniably, and as this book is simply the second half of it, it must be as well. However, I can't see any point in buying this, or its partner (the first half of ""The Great Hunt,"" titled ""The Hunt Begins""). Granted that the original book was a bit big and bulky, why buy two books that are merely the halves of one? They will cost significantly more. The pacing and flow of the books cannot help but to be skewed by the division. There is no upside to the deal that I can see. Again, I highly recommend the story; it's an excellent example of Jordan at his best. However, just buy the original, save yourself some money, and enjoy the book in its entirety, the way it was meant to be read."
3,"NOT ALLTHAT, BUT BETTER THAN D4L","Don't expect anything more than tight production and enjoyable shouted hooks from On Top Of Our Game, because it will only disappoint you. Along with not being able to distinguish between members of the group since no member stands out amongst the others-DFB does provide enough flavor to bring some fun back into Hip-Hop as a collective."
1,IS THIS A JOKE?,"I cant believe several of the reviewers of this piece of garbage they call an album actually said the lyrics were good.WHAT????????????? The lyrics on this album are wack! The beats are even worse,and there is no concept to it at all. Its just a bunch of lame songs.If you really wanna hear real hip hop lyrics and beats check out WU TANG or MOBB DEEP!"
1,Boo them off stage.,I'm sorry but the guy below me doesn't know music if he was slapped with a Gang starr cd. This mess is ridiculous. I wouldn't even want to hear this garbage in the klub let alone banging in my car. They are the modern day version of Young mc....here today gone tomorrow.
1,Uhhhhh....,"This album wasn't really good, it can get a little catchy like in ""I Think They Like Me"" and ""Ridin' Rims"", but I think ""Freaky As She Wanna Be"" was the worst song in this CD. I heard this album some where in google, but forgot. I really didn't like rap, I can't believe I wanted this album at the first place. I'm not a rap fan, but I think this would be perfect for many rap fans. Enjoy n***as!"
1,i would give (-1),"dfb sucks ,5 stars !!!! y all be kidding this is the worse album i ever heard .everybody is tired of leanin and rockin we all wanna reflect,think ,we need real music men with expression."
2,I'd give it 2 and a Half stars,"I downloaded this b4 it came out and I'm glad I downloaded it. ""Oh I Think They Like Me"" was an aiight song when it dropped but ""Lean Wit It Rock Wit It"" got played out the 2nd time I heard it. Only good songs on this album are:My Music (cuz Bun B is on it)Bricks 4 The High (cuz Jim Jones on it, beat is good)Ridin' Rims (hot)Don't Play Wit Me (Three 6 Mafia can't even save DFB on this one. but ok)"
1,typical rap that sucks,these guys are whack.. this just shows how easy it is to become a rap artist these days. this album doesnt hold one good song its terrible. its true you cannot spell crap with out a R-A-P.want a good album CHROME- STRAIGHT TO THE PROS
1,axmiles,It was the worst cd I ever bought in my whole life!there is way to much cursing and being racist!IT IS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!I do not even like DFB any longer!
1,D4L = fell off,"On The Top Of What Game? DFB has no game whatsoever, they are atrocious and all their music is trash. I hope they ride their game straight to the bottom, because thats where they obviously will find themselves in about a month. ""White Tee"" ""lean wit it, Rock wit it"" have the same beat and same motion with the lyrics, if no one else notices that then u have to be a no-nothing psycho idiot. Holla to real artists in the midwest : Do or Die, Snypaz, Crucial Conflict, Psycho Drama, Twista, Kanye West, Common, Johnny P, Krayzie Layzie Bizzy Wish N Flesh Bone Thugs N Harmony"
1,A totally unlistenable piece of garbage,"This album is just terrible from start to finish. Some of the beats are decent, but the lyrics on here are just straight up WACK!!! This ""Snap rap"" has got to be the worst thing to happen to hip hop since Vanilla Ice came on the scene. Do yourself a favor and avoid this garbage because it's most certainly one of the worst albums of the year."
1,They shouldn't be the top of this album.,"On top or our game 1/2 StarThis is a pointless follow up to one of the worst albums of 2004, this one is even worse and it recycles the same material to become one of the worst hip hop albums of 2006, this album is incredibly awful, the lyrics are terrible, the beats are pointless, the record cover is bad.Now I Enjoy some of jermaine dupri's stuff in other musicians (Mariah Carey, Jagged Edge, Janet Jackson), but this one is terrible, Inept hopeless, stupid and so HaplessThumbs Way, Way Down for Me on this album."
2,Not Worth The Money.......,"I got this cd before it ever came out. I downloaded off from bearshare i burned it, And all i gotta say is that this cd blow's. There must of been 4 song's that caught my attention.""My Music"" with Bun B, And with Pimp C in the hook was just a great song.""You Know What It Is"" is truly a bangin song to bump to.""Freaky As She Wanna Be"" is A+ for sure the best track in this cd. The beat is wow, really good, And Trey Songz did good on the hook.""Don't Play With Me"" with of course Prophet Posse A.K.A: 36 Mafia, And this song has the same beat as of that 36 mafia song ""Who Run It"",And this song is pretty decent to listen to, But is nothing compared to ""Who Run It"".Well all i got to say is if this album goe's platinum which i doubt, I just will feel so damn pissed of all the people that think this album will be the good cd. I recommend before buy, download it online, Cause you will just feel sorry of wasting $12.00 on this hideous record."
2,why do they drink cough stuff?,"my older brother likes this band. they all drink cold surup and sit on the couch and listen to this tape and that other scary man michael jones. the music is pretty good, it makes me want to dance but my brother and all his friends are too tired to dance from the cough surup they drink. i think that the music is ok."
1,More pop rap crap,"Ok I'll admit I'm white and I know this not real rap....How in the world did 90's g funk rap come to this crap...It show that to be a rapper nowday's doesnt take alot of talent come up with a hit....All you need is a club beat and some dumb lines like I got ice and I'm rollin on dubs and it will sell regardless....I know I cant really convince most people not to buy this mainly because most modern rap fans nowday's are between the ages of 10-16 and there used to pretty boy rap....If your like me like real rap about the streets and not the materialistic crap not most average people can't relate to stay away....Good rappers a re like brotha lynch hung,scareface,gangsta n.i.p.,celly cel,spice 1,yukmouth,crime boss,bone thugs real artist that rep the street not backstreet boys or 98% rap...So bascially rap sucks now and Ive move to different type of music...."
1,"""This Rating Scale needs to Have 0 STARS!!!""","I don't have any more to write about this piece of trash.This isn't Hip Hop, this is a disgrace."
2,Pedigree needs to repair the grinder,"My five dogs eat Pedigree dry dog food, so when my oldest dachshund started having trouble chewing, I bought the same brand of canned. She can't eat most of the stuff in the can, because, contrary to the label, it isn't ground. Pieces that I assume are dried organ meat are difficult to chew, and most of the remainder is shredded at best. I don't know if the company has attempted to cut costs by speeding up the process or by failing to repair substandard machinery, but they've lost my business. Poor product for the price. Unfortunately, I bought a whole case."
1,I Have Numbered All The Stars This Collection is Worth: 0,"Sadly, Amazon does not allow 0-Star reviews, or I would not allot this collection a single star. This painfully trite collection mistakes pathetic characters with empathetic ones and most often reads like the morose whining of a teenager. The author's prose is stilted and overwrought, and the stories themselves are nothing more than a predictable pastiche of worn cliches. Each individual story is less endearing than the last, and Westmoreland's characters are written as broad archetypes.For some reason, Amazon keeps seeing fit to remove the negative reviews of this text (without notifying the author of said reviews), but fans of fiction- especially short stories- should seek out other, better examples of the genre. The fiction world is littered with great texts, but ""Good as Any"" is surpassed by all in both story and character."
3,NICE TIME TRAVEL!,"Just to make myself clear, 3 stars means that this is a nice book. Not a great book, but not a dud either. I enjoyed Olivia and Alyson. Also thought Geoffrey was a cutie. Nicholas, however, seemed to have trouble deciding what his personality was going to be from day to day. He was a cold, arrogant oaf who eventually degenerated into a needy puddle of mush. The ending is very well done, working out just right. I will look into other books by this author."
5,If you like Licorice you will love this tea!,"I was never a tea drinker, but after giving up coffee I was looking for another hot decaf drink for cold winter mornings. This tea fit the bill! It has a very nice licorice flavor and is sweet enough that it doesn't need any added sugar. There is no funny aftertaste that I seem to always get from other teas. If you like Licorice, I'm sure you will enjoy this tea."
3,great tasting tea - but maybe i drank too much,"The first time I tried this tea, I absolutely loved it. The taste is amazing and it's hard to believe there is no sweetener in this. It is that good. I think I had three cups of it the first time I tried it. The next morning, my kidney's felt really sore, I don't know if it's something to do with the cleansing aspects, but I did cut back. I'll have one now once a week, but wish I could drink it more, it is that good tasting. Only three stars because of my kidney reaction, but otherwise great!"
1,Not my cup of tea,"This is the worst tea I have ever had. I love licorice but the the combination in this tea is gaggy, thick, sweetish - hard to describe but my taste buds say NO."
3,Product mistake made on Subscription,I received the wrong Yogi tea on my Subscribe & Save. I received the Yogi Egyptian Licorice Mint (green box) instead of the plain Yogi Egyptian Licorice (purple box). I used it--but please be cognizant in the future of not allowing this mistake to occur. Thanks.
1,TERRIBLE:,"I HATE THIS TEA, I LOVE LICORICE, BUT I HATE THIS TEA, IT IS TERRIBLE, THE SMELL AND THE TASTE. I HATE IT, I RATE THIS TEA A ZERO! YUCK!!!"
5,I love my Yogi tea so much I keep it at the office and take it when I travel .,I have been drinking Yogi brand Licorice tea almost every morning and night for the past year. I think I'm addicted. It is both calming and aids in digestion especially before going to bed.My daughter Sarah and cousin Marlene have joined me in drinking it regularlySo now I have it automatically delivered through Amazon.com every 3 months
5,This is the BEST tea.,This is the very best tea for licorice lovers. It has a great flavor that only gets better toward the end of the mug! Buy it and enjoy.
3,A little too light scented for me.,"This is a very light scent. Good for a young girl or someone who likes just a bit of scent. Pretty, but not for me. Came to me very well wrapped."
1,Blah,I really need to stop ordering perfume online. I only have myself o blame. This smells bad. Like really rancid old patchouli oil
4,Great Air Purifier,"This isn't my first one. Purchased it to replace the very old one I used for years. These are great, simple to use fan / air purifiers. The filters are a bit pricey (but that's normal for HEPA filters for anything though). I love that they now simplified the filter purchasing. Big labels with the letter ""C"" on them. This way you don't have to search for a specific model filter."
2,doesnt do what it says,this does not work as advertised. i put my cigarette by the machine and it didn't start sucking in the smoke until it was 5 inches from the back of it... VERY POOR performance.
2,Not as described,"The unit that I received does not have a permanent filer; they're definitely of the replaceable variety. I really should have returned the unit when I found this out but I'm disabled and don't really have a way to get it shipped back. I guess it works well enough but I didn't want the ongoing expense of replaceable filters. After using it for several weeks on high speed, it's developed some rather severe rattles to the point that it sounds like it's about to self-destruct. Not at all happy with this purchase."
2,Not Everything I Was Expecting,"I have noticed a slight difference in the morning when I wake up I don't cough as much as I used to. However, the purifier has some major downsides. The biggest downside is the fact that it dries out the air. I can tolerate it but everyone else who comes into my living space has a difficult time. It is also very loud almost as loud as an air conditioner. So keep that in mind, I kind of wish I spent more money and went with the more trustworthy brand."
1,The description is out of date - DO NOT BUY based on the description,"I intentionally purchased this filter because I do not want to have to buy replacement filters. It comes with 2 filters that are recommended to be replaced every 6 months.Uses 90+ Watts on high, so its like burning 2 regular bulbs non stop in your home.I have a filter already like this one and it works fine, but the item is not as described and for the price I could have bought 3 of the smaller holmes ones to cover more square feet."
4,good product and quiet,"so far it seems to work pretty well in Iraq. It is quiet so I don't disturb my neighbors in the CHU. The best part is the reusable prefilter, just wash it and reinstall it."
4,Excellent product,"I bought this product because I bought a house and did some renovations, so I was hoping to clear up the air. I haven't had a problem with my allergies since I've purchased the product. It is a bit noisy, sounds like a fan. Could be a little bit quieter. But it is super easy to set up."
1,Too loud even on lowest speed,"It is louder than a fan I own. Even on the lowest speed, it is loud. I don't recommend this product."
1,Disappointed,"This was my second Honeywell air filter. I returned it days after it came. It discharged a smell of burnt plastic. Kind of odd since its supposed to remove odors. I purchased another at another location, slightly different model and its fine. I clearly had a bad unit."
3,"Good equipment, HEPA Filter not really Permanent","Good Equipment so far. I have only use it for 2 days but its working fine. Little noisy at maximum speed. The product is marketed at amazon as if the HEPA filter needs never to be replaced, however, the operation manual suggests the HEPA filters (it uses 2 units)should be replaced every 6 months depending on the use and each one costs aprox. US$40.0,0 so take this into account. I assume one may really vacuum these HEPA Filters and extend their life for more than 6 months, but at some point they will have to be replaced. This is why I am only giving it 3 stars as I felt very dissapointed for this."
1,Doesn't work.,"I just honestly do not think this thing does anything. I bought this for the kitchen to replace the Honeywell HHT-011 (which worked very well but broke due to a fall) because we can smell cigarette smoke from first floor tenants coming up from under the kitchen sink cabinet. When I walk into the kitchen the whole room smells like smoke, whereas the previous Honeywell we had when pointed at the cabinet would suck the smell up immediately and we could never smell it. I really wanted this to work, it is attractive and sleek looking as far as air filters go, but I really think after two months of having it that all it does is use electricity, I don't actually think it works."
1,"If you are looking for a Permanent HEPA filter, DO NOT BUY!!",As other people have pointed out this product description is WRONG! The filters that come with the HHT-081 are HRF-C1 x 2 which need to be replaced every 6 months. I'm going to try this filterhttp://www.amazon.com/Honeywell-HFD-120-Q-Purifier-Permanent-Filter/dp/B000ANEPYO/ref=pd_rhf_gw_p_t_2which also claims it has a permanent IFD filter which is explained here [...].
3,Not correct advertising,Does not have a permanent HEPA fileter you have to replace a filter every 6 months. Other than that I wanted a permanent filter air cleaner it is great
1,Filter DOES need regular replacing,"I bought this after reading that it has a permanent filter that could be vacuumed and that I would not need to be spending for replacement filters. Under the ""Electronic Filter Check Reminder"" section in the instruction manual, it reads ""You should periodically check the filter. Depending on operating conditions, the filters should be replaced every 6 months.""The next section is titles ""Replacing the Hepa-Type Filters."" it gives a link to buy the filters every 6 months at [...]. It also gives a phone number to order replacement filters.The description at Amazon.com seems to be untrue. The instructions state that this air purifier does need regular filter replacing."
2,not happy yet,So the title says Tower Air Purifier with Permanent HEPA Filter but when you get it the box says hepa TYPE. I missed this in the description so partially my fault but I think the wording is misleading.This thing SMELLS when you unpack and run it. I have had it running for 24 hours now hoping the stink clears out but so far it still smells. Who wants to buy an air purifier that smells?
3,Noticeable difference....,"I just bought the air purifier about a month or so ago. There is a noticeable difference in my breathing. I have always had trouble breathing in through my nose so this I feel has had a positive impact on me. Although, I would have to say that's it's not much of a significant difference. But, every little bit helps.:-)"
3,works great - just not same as described,"This air purifier does a great job. I ordered it to replace an older unit that had lost the ability to reduce my allergy symptoms. I immediately noticed an improvement in my allergies as soon as I plugged in this unit.So why don't I rate it 5 stars? Only because the unit is described as having a permanent filter, when the actual unit does not have permanent filters, it has replaceable filters."
1,not as stated,"It says ""Permanent"" filter, right in the description. I opened the box and it says replace filter every six months. What is their interpretation of permanent!! Really angry at this deception. Returning is such a hassle and they know it. I also ordered an LG filter for my fabulous fridge and got an imitation cheapo replacement instead. Must be the way Amazon runs their business. Not very good for a repeat customer base. Think I will shop elsewhere from now on. Bad Business."
3,Good filter but it appears the filter DOES need replacing,"Filter seems to work well and does not emit a ton of cold air like some others do. However, I went to clean the filter and it said it should be replaced every SIX months, which is clearly not permanent, as the description states. I bought this specifically for this reason so am a bit disappointed at this."
4,Not a HEPA filter,"The description says HEPA filter, but the box said HEPA-type filter. I am not sure what this will mean for the life of the filter, as I have vaccumed it several times and it still looks dirty. However there seems to be less dust in the room and my son says he has less allergy issues at night, so - so far so good.I origninally rated this 4 stars, but would downgrade to 2 stars.I have owned this for almost a year now, the fan now makes an annoying rattling sound that lessens somewhat on the high setting. The 'clean filter' light has come on and stayed on even though I vacuum it weekly. For what I paid I am disappointed in the performance."
3,Mostly shipping problems?,"These arrived relatively quick, considering they were shipped from Hawaii to WV via Priority mail, however they have obviously not been placed in the coolest part of the shipment as they had some serious melting happen apparently in transit. I gave these a 3 star rating because they did not have as good a quality of chocolate as I am used to having with macadamia nuts, Hershey's chocolate would have been better (but not good enough to make me happy)"
5,YOU CAN REALLY HEAR ALL THE HARD WORK & EFFORT,"I remember when I got this album right when it came out I must admit I was a bit disapointed because it was very different from all Rick's previous work ,I felt it was a little over produced.BUT with the whirlwind of changing music that followed this album(RAP ,GLAM, GRUNGE)I can really appreciate the quality and production of TAO.It's become one of my favorite Rick albums."
5,"Rcik Springfield, Tao, Amazing","This was the most different music from Rick Springfield in the 80's that will last a lifetime. Some of the songs, especially My Fathers Chair and State of the Heart, will live on forever. This showed a different side of Rick, and it kept him on top of the charts once again after Love Somebody was a top 5 single the year before. The songs on this are just amazing, and really help you look inside yourself and feel at peace, even with Rick Rockin away! The one word I keep coming back to is Amazing.I cannot wait to buy Venus in Overdrive this late July!!"
2,not as good as I thought it would be,Maybe my hopes were to high...but I found the book quite slow.I thought I was going to die if the end of the opera description didn't come soon enough!!!
2,Not enough to sink my teeth into...,"Does anyone think that Dr. Weyland is a whiney, clumsy and sometimes bratty vampire? I just couldn't get into this book. I would read it, put it down, not come back to it for weeks, until I finally got through it all. I can't explain it, I just wasn't interested in him, or any of the other people in this book. Above anything, I love vampire books, and this book just didn't cut it for me. About the only thing I found interesting was how he fed. Not in the the traditional fang in throat method, but a clever ""tongue stinger"" type device. Other than that, the rest just faded away."
4,A truly orginal vampire,"Ms. Charnas creates here a really unique monster. Her predator is so believable, it seems possible. This is not a brooding creature (like the Anne Rice variety), but a cunning animal, who even knows he cannot allow himself to empathize with his human victims and behave emotionally.I wouldn't suggest this to the Goth crowd. If you are ready to meet a different kind of vampire, step in..."
3,Required Text,I purchased this book for my Contemporary American Indians course at UALR. It has a lot of information that was very useful for my required readings. It is not something to read for leisure unless your really an avid reader of Native American history.
5,Wish it was mine!,"I bought this book as a Christmas gift for my niece, and glanced through it before I wrapped it up. It looks great! Very detailed, great step-by-step photos. Appears that it would be a good training book for a theatre makeup beginner. I've put it on my own wish list and am hoping to see it under the tree. If not, I'm certainly going to buy a copy for myself!"
4,Helpful photos~~,"This book is filled with very helpful photos. Unfortunately... I was hoping to see more variety. Example, more drastic changes on the people before and after makeup. Example, children having an ""old age"" makeup on, making them look like aged folks. More animal face painting maybe?Perhaps a little more special effects in it?Nevertheless... I enjoyed this book."
2,not so much,The cover made it look a lot better then it is. It only gives you a few looks not as many as I hoped it would be. I guess it's okat if your playing an old person or a monster. *sruges*
4,Interesting,"I was doing a pack of zombies, so this book didn't really have a lot of what I needed, but I did pull some tips from it. I can also see myself refering to it in the future for other projects!"
3,"Good, but limited in scope","I am an older actor (50's) and was looking for something that would give some solid help with good make-up technique, especially with the older face (all of the models are much younger in this book). The price is a little high for a book this short and too much time is given to ""fantasy"" type faces. Not as useful as I had hoped it would be. If this is a ""textbook"" it must be for a very limited ""overview"" type class."
3,nothing special,"The design techniques for basic contouring and period make-up are solid and the full color photos are helpful. Also, the author includes solid instructions for tranfering drawn schematics onto the face. The ""fantasy"" make-up section though is a joke-she showcases design projects from her jr. high/high school classes and many more closely resemble advanced face-painting instead of useful stage techniques. Unfortunately this book is still superior to many beginning stage make-up books on the market."
4,"Tragic love story, told in flashback","Made early in Bergman's film career, this is a simple, almost fable-like tale of a summer romance between two young lovers, as remembered by the woman, now an unsatisfied adult, who returns to the island where she passed one happy summer. The film beautifully evokes the giddiness of young love, the tragedy of unfulfilled promise, and the healing powers of time."
4,"Another strong, if not quite classic, early Bergman work","Touching, simple story of how a young girl's summer romance with asweet, modest young man, changes a her adult life as a ballet dancerforever.Told in flashback, beautifully shot, and mostly well (if not quitebrilliantly) acted, this lovely film could have been even stronger ifthe two leads both didn't look and feel much too old for their roles,making their naiveté and innocence feel a bit forced.But there's much that's moving and insightful here about youthfulidealism versus life's hard realities."
4,A Almost Great Movie,"This movie was made by Ingmar Bergman, one of the greatest film makers in history. This was his tenth film and the first that showed the greatness to come. This is a very good movie, but not one of Bergman's greatest. It is better than 99.5% of the movies produced in the U.S. in any given year. I wholeheartly recommend this movie and know a movie fan will be very glad they have this DVD."
4,An How to Do It Guide to Suriving in Rural Canada,"If you're interested in how people lived in rural Canada during the 1800s, this book will give a first hand account. The book is composed of the author's letters back home to England, and answering questions from friends back home. She gives detail encounters of the voyage to her new home, cultivating the land, the hardships they face with their land, diseases, and the climate, and who is best suited for this type of life. Catharine Parr Traill is a great storyteller who is engaging and very descriptive in her writings. This is a good book if you want to really see what life was like for the early pioneers in North America."
5,A Wonderful Way to Spark A Child's Interest!,The Eyewitness series of books is primarily aimed at children ages 8-14. They are all full of many clear bright color photographs and illustrations that are each accompanied by a paragraph or so of factual information. The Eyewitness series is a great way to spark a youth's interest in a subject. They have books on just about every topic imaginable from Archaeology to Zoology.
2,Not too good.,This book wasn't that great because it was boring and didn't have that much imformation. It's scientific facts of the people wern't that good.
2,One of the poorest Eyewitness Books,"I'm a huge fan of the DK Eyewitness series, but even so, I could not like this book despite the usual gorgeous photographs.The pages were arranged thematically and the different cultures (Aztec, Inca, Maya, Toltec, Olmec, Moche, Mixtec, Nazca...) were so intermixed that it became painful to keep which was which straight--and I already knew a nontrivial amount about most of them!The SLJ wrote in their review, ""Although the pictures are bright, clear, and attention grabbing, the text is just random facts scattered across the pages. These majestic cultures are done a disservice by this weightless flitting from topic to topic."" I couldn't agree more. SKIP this one!"
3,geared more towards really young or really simple,"this book said it was okay for middle school kids and i found it to be a little too childish even for that. some good information, but would have liked more of it."
5,A great book!,"This book is exceptional. It provides several programming scenarios for different operations, then lists the good and bad points of each. It also explains in which situation they are best used. For example: .NET Remoting vs. Web Services vs. COMThere are several performance tips given that I never thought about and they really work . . . I, of course, had to test them for myself.If you are like me, you don't have time to test every scenario to find out which technique is best for every situation, this book helped to guide me in the right direction."
1,Not the same hats that are pictured!,"I ordered two of these hats believing that they were adult size, however the hats I received were not the same as what is pictured on line. The shape is very different and the size is for a child's head, not for an adult. I'm not at all happy about this and I don't recommend them to anyone unless you are buying it for a child. Not only that but the price (especially after shipping costs) is way too much to pay for a child's cap. I am convince that this is a case of INTENTIONAL MISREPRESENTATION, so BUYER BE WARE!"
1,"picture is deceiving, completely disappointed",This product looks nothing like the picture. It's hideous and is not worth the penny + $3.99 shipping.
5,Perfect,"I have had no problem with these covers. They go on easy, my 5 year old can even change them. I also have dogs who have grabbed them off the table when they weren't in use and they couldn't damage them... I think they are a great product especially for the price! I'm writing the same review for all the 3 covers I purchased because they are all great!"
3,Slippery,"I cannot say with any certainty that this provides any additional protection - especially not compared to the original skin that comes with the controller.This is a very slick controller, so it feels odd at first. After getting used to it, it is just fine."
4,MRS.,"Thinner material then the ones that come with the controls when purchased, but that makes them easier to get on and off. Great value. Too bad it costs more to ship it, then to purchase it."
1,Bought 3 and 2 ripped,"I bought three of these silicone skins, black, blue and pink for the wii remotes. The blue and pink both ripped at the bottom when putting them on. Very disappointed. Not as sturdy as the ones that come with the wii. Wanted different colors for the kids."
3,"pretty cheap, but look at the price","Very cheaply packaged and made, in fact they came in a clear bag, also hard to fit on controllers."
1,Challenging? More like impossible!,"I have been practicing yoga primarily from in-home dvd's for about 3 years. I moved from pretty darn inflexible to being able to do most of the standard poses pretty well. One of my favorites is Rodney Yee's Power Yoga for the reasonably fast pace and mix of some challenging poses. Based on some of the other reviews I guessed this might be just a bit more challenging. About half-way through this dvd I got completely discouraged. Most of the later poses are basically impossible for anyone but a serious practitioner or very flexible. While he may give you 'options' this basically means sitting there and doing the same thing over and over again, without any flow.Maybe if you are already into 'ashtanga' and are looking for an in-home dvd to accompany your pracitice it would be fine. Otherwise, I'd stay away."
3,"Instruction is great, DVD of poor quality","David Swenson's instruction is clear, the pace is a little bit fast to follow. But the quality of the video is far from satisfactory. The pixel is too large, you can not see clearly the fine features on the screen. To me, it looks like they copy it from a poor VHS to make a DVD. Though I bought it new from Amazon, the first time I follow it, some places are not even continuous, there are sound breaks. The different sections showing in the main menu are basically continuous, after I chose to jump to a certain chapter, the DVD show doesn't run smoothly.Overall, I really like David Swenson's instruction. It is like taking a led-class, helping me pace myself. But it is a poorly made DVD."
4,excellent and comprehensive ahstanga yoga dvd,"this dvd has become the basis for my daily yoga practicethe best thing about it is the various options David gives for doing the poses , allowing people at different levels to benefit .another good thing is the constant advice given to listen to your own body and what it can do , rather than aspiring to some imagined level or what is seen on the dvd .many people could understandably find the level demonstrated by David overwhelming , or get lost in futile comparisons between themselves and what they see , but I find the way he teaches inspiring rather than depressing ."
1,Very Poor Quality DVD,"This is the worst quality DVD I have ever purchased. The picture is very grainy. I've tried playing on my computer, blue ray player and regular dvd player. The quality is so poor it is unwatchable. Don't waste your money."
3,advanced yoga,great if want fast advanced yoga. dvd seemed to be taped in 1980's. pic low quality and just not what i was looking for. advanced practice myself but just was not too impressed with this. returning it.
5,A shoe saver,This is a great product that saves my leather soled shoes during the rainy season here in Indonesia. I would recommend this item for anyone who values a good pair of leather shoes.
5,Best shoes if on your feet most of the day.,Comfortable as walking shoes always look great for any occasion Best shoes if on your feet most of the day.
5,These are terrific.,I have used the medium for years but recent shoe purchases (same size) don't fit into the mediums any more. Went with the large and they now all fit just great.
1,NO ONE SHOULD BE FORCED TO SUFFER THROUGH THIS BOOK!!!!!!!,I HATED THE BOOK! I DON'T THINK ANYONE SHOULD TRY TO LEARN HTML WITH IT. I can tell you first hand that you won't get far. I do not see how this poorly written and poorly executed book got so much praise. The writing is just plain awful. I didn't understand much of the book.
1,A must have reference book!,Elizabeth Castro has included more info in 150 pages than most of the huge HTML books out there. Best reference I've found for hand coding
5,My favorite HTML Reference book!,"After using this book for 2 years, I still recommend it highly, especially for beginners. I use it as a reference. It is easy to read and follow. It makes HTML fun to learn...END"
5,A rare find of historic country building plans,"I am an architect designing a house for a client -it is a Charleston Style house with the master bedroom in a ""carriage house"" attached at the rear. This book helped me to create/design a more authentic carriage house. I am a horse lover from way back so I ate up the book front to back! I was pleased to find many examples of architectural details and embellishments. The plans of historic houses and barns are a rare treasure. Would be fun to build one of the farm houses!"
5,A background of the evolution of early american housing,Donald J. Berg does an outstanding job of showing the evolution of the designs and the backgrounds of the designers of single family housing primarily in the 19th century. The plans and illustrations are excellent for those that want to use them as a guide for present day construction.
2,"OK, but too sketchy","There was a nice range of different types and styles of buildings, but VERY sketchy information. Just wasn't quite what I was looking for."
1,where is my book,"i bought this book over a month ago, the semester is almost over and it still has not arrived."
1,Seller Deserves a Negative Rating,Do not buy from this seller. I purchased my book from this seller around the 2nd week of August and the seller has not shipped the book that I needed for the 1st week of September. I have attempted to contact this seller and to this day no response.
1,HORRIBLE!,"Horrible! I have tried to contact this seller numerous time and he still hasn't responded once. I would not recommend getting anything through him! I put my order in weeks ago, and still haven't gotten anything. I placed two other orders the same day and got my stuff in a week and a half ago!!!"
4,works like a GFCI should.,I bought this to wire an endless pool sub panel as the manufacturer spec'd 30 amp. Haven't heard a peep out of the customer. :)))))
2,Not an impressive start-Pink Floyd wannabes,"This is Tangerine Dream's first album. It is only 36 minutes long. Sound quality and mix are not very good.About half of this album is just noise, with the band members just clanking on stuff or making eerie sounds. Much of it sounds like one of those Halloween albums of spooky sounds.The other half is some interesting coherent music, with some interesting trade offs between organ, guitar and drums. The music is really harsh, churning and metallic. But, the whole thing sounds like a rip-off of earlier Pink Floyd music, specifcially Saucer Full of Secrets, Atom Heart Mother and Ummagumma. (Atom Heart Mother and this album would be released at about the same time, but Pink Floyd had been playing variations on Atom Heart Mother for a couple of years).This album is nothing like later Tangerine Dream album, where they would soften their sound and move towards more electonica and ambient."
3,ELVIS DESERVES MORE !!!!!,"Great box, but we have better compilations of him. By the way, where are all those superb gospel-recordings? I miss them"
5,Sharp Package!,"I know, I know everybody wants more cuts on this 3cd set butfor the time they had to work with on each CD, RCA filled it up withsome strong songs. Yea, we do get to hear ""Teddy Bear"" and ""Heartbreak Hotel"" for the millionth time but it has to be on here because of what it did for Elvis' career making him the undisputed artist of the century. The song selection is very good, especially with the good sprinkling of album cuts, but what impresses me the most is the packaging, notes, and pictures inside the 3 booklets. That was really cool of RCA to do that. Its much better than the actual boxes of the 50's, 60's, and 70's sets. No matter if you're a diehard fan of Elvis or just a casual fan, you should definately purchase this album. It's well worth the $45 and then some."
5,A superb guide to honing one's sailing skills,"Written by the editor of ""Sail"" magazine, whose extensive experience includes competition in long-distance ocean races, Sailpower: Trim And Techniques For Cruising Sailors is a thoroughly detailed instructional to effectively operating a sailboat. Color photographs illustrate the how-to, step-by-step advice for setting up the rig, controlling the mainsail, trimming the mainsail and headsail, handling reefing systems, coping with strong winds, troubleshooting, and much more. Presented in a friendly, accessible tone as accessible to lay readers as to seasoned sailors, Sailpower is a superb guide to honing one's sailing skills and highly recommended for anyone considering the hobby or simply wanting to know more about what it is like."
4,solid and powerful,"This saw was easy to assemble and the shipping was smooth.Don't forget to get a plug as the saw does not come with one. Also, don't bother with the stockblade, this thing is terrible. It is amazing how great the saw cuts with a good blade in it.I have a 3/4 4tpi blade right now and it slices through cherry and walnut easily. I had it tracking straight and re-sawing even cuts with just a minimum of tuning.The only complaint about the saw is the amount of effort required to change blades.To really adjust the lower bearings, the table is in the way. Due to this I could not give it a 5 star as I am somewhat reluctant to change blades to the task.But the power, fit and finish and features for the price make this an amazing saw."
5,"grizzly 14"" Bandsaw",This saw is an excellent buy. The customer service from Grizzly is wonderful. I am a woodcrafter and work out of my garage at home. This piece of equipment performs great. It turned out to better than I expected.
5,Excellent Book!,Very pragmatic and focused. Ward has done an excellent job covering the important aspects of successfully connecting to the Internet.
3,A glossary book for beginners,This book covers lots of network terminology without much detail. This is really a book for beginners or for those who want glossaries. The price makes it attractive though.
1,Want to learn hebrew,They have the hebrew backwards!! You are supposed to read hebrew right to left-the opposite of english and this cd has it left to right. I find it extremely confusing. I know how to read hebrew and I wanted to learn how to speak it.What a poor effort!
1,There's no Latin either!,"My boss asked me to get this, so that he check out the Latin portion of it.What a waste! The only Latin on this CD is *Latin* American Spanish.The interface was underwhelming. I needed to guess at what did what, because the controls are mostly icons. What's worse, there is no menu bar at the top to help take the guess work out of using the program.Apparently though, the manufacturer did throw in an extra *not* listed on the back. If you are learning the differences between US and UK English, its there!I gave this one star, only because I couldn't give it no stars."
1,Very sad to hear there is no Haitian Creole on this CD-Rom,I found this title messing around adding things to my wish list. I only read the blurb on Amazon enough to see Haitian Creaole listed as one of the languages. Today updating my wish list I took extra time to find out why this was rated so low since nearly every thing on my list is 4 stars or more! How unfortunate to find out that others before me made the mistake I almost made buying this in hopes of it having Haitian Creole! Very disappointing!!!! The makers should be ashamed!
2,False advertising,"I just bought and installed this CD with the hopes of learning some Haitian Creole, and I, too, couldn't find it. There is absolutely nothing on the installation CD that mentions either Haiti or creole... except the jewel case which insists it's there. I'm so dissapointed I haven't actually tested anything else out: I consider this a VERY bad start!"
5,One of my favorite reads as a child and even today,"I swear, I am stuck in literary time. When I was 10 years old I would go down to the local bookstore and spend my allowance on a new Choose Your Own Adventure book. The first one I read was Inca Gold and then I was addicted. I bought the Cave of Time next. This one I read several times because there was SO much adventure and twists and turns. I don't know what happened to my lovely collection of books, but I'm 31 now and I have just bought some of my old favorites again. You're never too old for adventure. :)"
5,An Imaginative Journey,"This book takes the reader on an imaginative armchair journey through time. The first and the best in Edward Packard's clever adventure series, it is fun to read again and again!"
5,This book takes some time to read-good time!,I've read this book many times and think it's one of the best Choose Your Own Adventure Books ever written.
4,Memories...,"I remember reading these books as a kid. I could spend hours rereading the same book over and over. And this is the first of the Choose Your Own Adventure books. Beware - there are other types out here, from the very good Time Machine books to the copy-cat if sometimes very weird Which Way Books. Not that those are bad it is just THESE are the books, in my mind that started it all.And this is the first of them! You find yourself in a cave but not just any cave - it is the CAVE OF TIME! You may end up int he time of knights, or the Ice age, or you may end up in the future! The end depends on YOU! And unless the Time Machine Books, you CAN die in these - so be careful and pick wisely!"
5,Outstanding,The first and one of the best in the series. The Cave of Time provides a keen sense of being in different worlds. The different passages from which to choose from succeed in keeping the reader in suspense. It's a shame that books like this that strike the imagination in young and old readers alike hardly get written anymore.
4,Careful with the handle!,"Overall I love this carseat but I found out today that I have been driving around with the handle in the wrong position. I have kept the handle in what the instructions refer to as the A position which is also the setting that you carry the seat in. After speaking to a police officer recently trained and certified in car seat installation/safety, he said the handle absolutely needs to be as far back as possible and provided a very strong arguement why. The manual that came with the seat is very ambiguous and does not specifically say this at all. I called Graco and suggested that this statement be added to the book for safety concerns and she argued that the seat was ""tested"" with the handle being up and it was fine.The officer I spoke to was adament that an infant could be in GRAVE danger if the handle is up in a crash. I think I am going to believe the police officer vs. the manufacturer!"
3,definitely could use improvement,"GOOD things:#1 lightweight#2 nice looking#3 convenient with Snap'n'Go stroller (I like being able to just pop this seat in the stroller without having to take my baby out of it while his head is still unstable.)NOT-SO-GOOD things:#1 Seat sits upright too far. Someone has to sit with the baby when they are newborn to keep their head from falling forward. After the first month, they're okay.#2 Head support flimsy. Need to purchase additional padding. (It SHOULD come with it.)#3 The things you have to push-in to adjust the handle stick sometimes.#4 I don't know if this is on every seat, but ours had a plastic bump sticking out under the pad where his lower back rests. I just now found it (after 4 months!), and I had to sand it down. Took me forever...it was pretty big. Make sure to check yours.#5 Finally, my child is 16 pounds and ready to move out of it. They say it holds up to 20 pounds, but I think that's pushing it."
1,Social production,The racing gets in the way of the Indianapolis hoopla. I had ambitions of going to Indianapolis to see a race or two -- not now. This movie lowers a true race fan's expectations of Indy. To the producer -- thanks for the warning.
2,Irritrol 12,"I purchased this product from a local dealer in Okanogan County. It was easy to setup, and the instructions are clear in the manual. However, it had issues keeping time and holding a schedule. It then died after one year, just as the warranty ran out. I have a fairly complex irrigation system, so it is a pain to replace and rewire. For the price, this product should last 10 years and function without issues. I would not recommend this product. [...]"
4,Talking to or at kids? This one's for you!,"Are you looking for a book about talking with kids? Deb has truly captured the way to reach them. Communication! A must read for Parents, Grandparents and Educators."
5,The best book written yet.,"I feel that Viotation was a great book. It made me think. I was always trying to guess the people in the thick of the story. I happened to stumble across her previous book, and feel in love with her writing. I find this to be her best yet. I can't wait for her next book."
3,"captivating plot, but oh, where did it go?","Why is everyone so nuts over this book? True, it was an original storyline, but it was written so poorly and incoherently I couldn't even figure out what the characters were doing. And the characters! Seems to me they went from a smart 13year-old to a child idiot..a 3-dimensional woman with severe psychological problems to a flat mother/girlfriend who's perfectly fine....and a WONDERFULLY cynical pessimist who again changed overnight. Incredibly bad storytelling. BOO!"
1,Bicyling For Dummies,"I found this book to be completely useless for the novice. Not one word about frame sizing in inches (as most bikes on the net are listed). It is for the far more advanced rider than a ""dummy"". Save your money. I got more help from the web about sizing. This book is only for the very advanced rider."
3,Not enough readers,"Even though this progressive pop can focus a little much on the latter at times, just the title track alone proves how impressively fluid compositional diversity can be and begs the question- why apparent complete obscurity?"
2,Little difficult,They sent me a copy that didn't work and I had a little hassle in returning it. They weren't so costumer friendly.
5,One of my All Time Favorite Movies,I worked in a video store in college back in the mid-80's and this was one of the movies that we would always recommend to customers when they asked for suggestions. I have waited for years to be able to have a DVD copy of it as I wore out the VHS copy that I purchased years ago. It is still one of my all-time favorite movies and anyone who watches it will not be disappointed.
3,Predictable but Enjoyable,"If you're expecting a hard-edged look at the lives of Vietnam medics, you will probably be disappointed with this rather predictable film, which leans hard toward glossy soap opera. Even so, ""Purple Hearts"" manages to combine an eye for detail with considerable atmosphere, and although ultimately dismissable it is a very watchable little movie that most will enjoy."
4,Surprisingly Good Movie!,"Let me start by being blunt. I'm a Vietnam combat veteran who was wounded in action so I have much appreciation and respect for medics and nurses, so when the storyline is about a doctor and nurse in the war, I tend to pay a little closer attention. As a combat veteran I tend to be a little cynical when it comes to war movies but you know what? This one surprised me! It is a well told story,with some nice acting and an actual plot. The director did a good job too that provides a convincing look and feel that, while being a little Hollywood, still carries it off. Would I recommend the movie? You bet!It is far better than many of the movies out today and well worth the investment for any movie lover.What also surprises me though is how few folks seem to have heard of it?"
2,Disappointment in the provider,"On March 5, 2011 I sent a second notice through Amazon to Standing Ovation from whom I ordered the DVD Purple Hearts. I originally ordered it on 2/21. The DVD came but I have been unable to play it on any of my DVD players. As stated, I have notified Amazon and Standing Ovation asking for a replacement or a refund to my checking account and so far I have heard nothing from either one. It is now 3/25. This is very disappointing especially from Amazon since I have made many purchases from and through them in the past. This is certainly coloring my plan for future purchases from Amazon since they say they stand behind their other vendors. I would like to have the movie on DVD. Please rectify this. Thank you"
4,Purple Hearts,"This was 1 of my favorite movies. So glad it is on DVD now. I'm just a war movie junkie and this movie rates at the top of my list. Buy it, yoou will enjoy it."
1,Purple Hearts- DVD,"The DVD would not play in my DVD player, because according to the DVD package it was copied in a format that is not compatible with all DVD devices. I would still be interested in obtaining the same title DVD if it would play in my player. I did not have any problems returning the DVD and having my account credited."
4,RECOMMENDED VIEWING,"I love Cheryl Ladd, plus war and romantic movies, putting these three together gave a great little story to watch.It is an old 1980's movie but still has lost none of its modern day appeal.I would recommend this movie to anyone who would like to escape to a bit of nostalgia, the story line is excellent and Cheryl's beauty and talent shines through."
3,Not as durable as the other figures,"We got all the Yellow submarine figures for our son, and I know they aren't intended for young children, but our son never put things in his mouth or anything. For some reason, the sucking monster's sucker and tail are made of a rubber material not present in any of the other figurines, so it was really appealing for him to chew on- and the paint came right off and the tail broke the first day. The other figurines were fine, although the submarine's propellers broke pretty fast, but I expected that. It was weird that this one figure had the strange rubber substance."
4,What Once Binds Also Cleaves,"This look at the drives and needs of teenagers on the cusp of adulthood has many facets. The most interesting is its examination of the forces that drive people together.The need for independence, for affection, for acceptance drives Monika into the arms of Harry. He provides these needs and they run off together.As the story progresses Monika discovers she has given up one cage for another, one of her own making. In finding this she does what she knows best - runs away.The transformation of Monika from a fresh faced young teenager at the beginning of the film to a woman whose inner ugliness is beginning to shine through is one of the great character developments on film."
3,Misleading Title,This movie is nothing like the front picture..a romantic time between 2 people.Nothing but a boy & girl who have absolutely no idea what life is like and obviously never gave it a thought what real life is like. Portrayed as 2 very innocent youngsters. Poorly written and poorly described.
3,Below par,"This is a collection of ""classic 70's disco"" and ""future disco house"". Unfortunately, it's mixed really, really badly - especially disc 2. No wonder it doesn't credit any specific DJ - they wouldn't want their name on it! Would have been a good compilation if they had stuck to the 12"" versions of the classic tracks or else got a decent DJ to do the mix. Sound quality on a few of the tracks is below par too."
2,I couldn't get past page 15,"I was very excited to read this book after finishing Duane Schultz excellent book about the damage control on USS Houston, where Santa Fe played an important role, but by page 15 I had counted 4 serious errors or editing mistakes, most notably that USS Saratoga was at the Battle of Midway.I couldn't plow on because I couldn't trust the information that I didn't know given that the stuff that I did was riddled with mistakes."
5,Trio Tservonaja Kalinonka is a Winner!,"The ensemble Tservonaja Kalinonka comes from Nikolajiv, near the Black Sea in Ukraine. Performed by the graduates of the Kyiv Conservatory on the bandura, the Ukrainian national instrument, (actually three banduras!) Wonderful voices, wonderful music. Almost all of the twenty pieces are performed in Ukrainian. First rate interpretations of ""Gutsulka Ksenja"", ""Glyboka Kimitsja"", and the instrumental piece ""Fantasia"". A real treat! Arranged by A.Dobrovolsky/ Produced in Holland."
2,Forgettable Western!,This film has some good actors in it but the plot is pretty shaky and hard to follow at times. It is not comparable to other great Westerns made during the sixties. Eli Wallach is good but confusing--who and what is he after? The color is good and it sounds like a Sergo Leone picure but it isn't. What a shame!!! It could have been made better--less comedy and more plot and of course --action and suspense!!!! Buy or rent on your own if you dare----I wouldn't.
2,"Only so-so, not worth the money","I've been disappointed with this map book. Sure it gives you a general map for the prominent rivers around the state and tells you where the boat ramps are, but I have several other resources for that information.As for specific, detailed, useful information for each river -- there is very little. What there is, is generic. Yes I know there is a winter steelhead run in this river. It goes from December to March? Really? How illuminating (not)."
4,Bronze Age,"Dickinson has put together a wonderful and thorough text. It can be hard to read in some places and with references to miscellaneous materials inserted into the middle of sentences. All-in-all, wonderful research material or advanced text, but too extensive for a beginner text."
2,Ginger Too Far,"I have purchased Yogi tea for years now. This tea is fine, but I was disappointed by the slight misinformation. I'm not sure why they simply call this tea ""Ginger"" at least on the front of the package. I am now paying much more attention to the actual ingredients of Yogi teas because this has 4 other ingredients of which 3 are in greater amount in this one. I just wanted plain ginger tea and this has licorice, lemongrass, peppermint & black pepper. Black pepper & licorice are very strong flavors especially if you aren't aware they are steeping in your cup. It's a fine tea, yet holds a misleading title. That's all. Thank you."
5,highly recommended,"This tea tastes fantastic. The subtle taste of black pepper and licorice adds a great touch.Be aware that this tea has ingredients other than just ginger, including licorice, peppermint, and black pepper."
3,Tastes Good But Bags Break,"The tea is fine, but beware of the poor quality of the bags. Twice in two evenings, with bags from different boxes, I have poured hot water over the bags only to have them break. I don't have this problem with Alvita, PG Tips or other tea bags. If you're going to purchase this tea, remember to pour the water first and then introduce the bag."
3,"Ok, but not the best",I found this tea to be a bit bland when compared to the Triple Leaf Tea. What I liked about triple leafe and found lacking in Yogi is the spiciness.
3,Doesn't taste very good.,"Yogi Ginger Tea is great for soothing stomachaches, but I can't say much about the taste. Pepper is the overwhelming flavor in this tea, and I wish the tea were sweeter. It tastes exactly as if you soaked ginger slices in water."
3,Difficult to drink - tastes peppery,"This ginger tea tasted very peppery, I cannot drink it. Does not taste so much like ginger."
1,not too tasty,"I bought this tea because my job was stressing me out and causing a lot of anxiety, indigestion, etc. and I use and love the other flavors of Yogi tea. Unfortunately, I can't handle the taste of this one. It's just too strong - almost burns your tongue because it is so spicy. I normally like ginger but this is too much."
3,Too much pepper for me,In small amounts a tasty tea but for a whole cup it is just too much pepper for me. Prefer ginger tea without pepper.
3,Lemon ginger taste is much more nicer,I have tried both Ginger and Lemon Ginger teas and my favorite is Lemon Ginger.
1,NO GOOD!!!!,"I know what Ginger tastes like and this is NOT Ginger. The only things I found pleasant about this tea is that it came in a beautiful box and the individual packs were nicely packaged, I don't care whether this is organic or not, the flavor of Ginger is absolutely absent. If you appreciate the aroma and strong flavor of good cup of Ginger tea then try ""Prince of Peace"" Honey Ginger Crystals. The aroma lights up the room, the flavor is strong and authentic and since they are crystals, there are no tea bags to deal with and the result is a good clean cup of genuine Ginger tea."
1,didn't like it,Didn't like this book. Had stories by multiple authors. Was not worth the money. Hard to find in used book stores.
5,"Speed Kill Hate ""Acts of Insanity"" A+++","You have to hear this.....this CD rocks!! I'm personally not a big Overkill fan, so I'm happy to say Speed Kill Hate sounds nothing like them. I was lucky enough to catch them play a few weeks ago at the Louder Harder Faster show in PA and have to say......SKH is definately a new favorite. It's the only CD I listen to anymore!! A must have for any fan of metal music. Oh and BTW, Mark Stater thanks for the hookup with The Hate Shop, it saved me ALOT of money.Kim Smalley"
1,Don't buy this if you care about the safety of your PC,"If you use this CD in your PC, Sony has created this CD to install a program on your computer that is impossible to remove, and renders your PC open to harmful programs. read more here: [...]I love Kirk Franklin just like the next person, but I don't deserve to have my PC calling Sony to tell them every time I play, record, or whatever with this disc. Even if you don't illegaly share music, don't you feel entitled to your privacy? If Hackers use this rootkit to hack computers (Only a matter of time), who will be responsible for your busted computer? Sony? Kirk? You for buying the CD?"
5,The best ablum!!!,"For christmas my sister got this for me,and I never heard of him before,but when I heard looking for you,hero,etc I really liked his songs!!! looking for you,theres a lot of chiors in here. Here are the best songs that I like,and I whould give them five stars.looking for you,hero,could've been,better,why,keep your headandwithout you.Well I hope you buy this CD,cause it is the best."
2,"always have respected Kirk,but this album is ok","Kirk Franklin is a Artist who I use to listen to alot back in the day.He was a feel Good Modern day Gospel Artist,but after a while He kinda lost some steam.His Music use to have such a bounce&groove feel to it,but now He seems to be going through the Motions.material he use to sample or loop had more up-beat but now Musically He is pulling a Puffy.Kirk franklin is a good artist who might need to re-group because this Album is only ok at best&coming from Kirk Franklin I expect to be Grooving."
3,Okay,"There were about 3 or 4 awesome songs on this CD, including Hero and Imagine Me. Kirk Franklin included songs that told a story, but the music was not very good. Also, I personally do not enjoy hearing him sing solo. Overall, I do not regret purchasing the CD because the 2 songs listed above are beautiful (the lyrics and the music)."
4,REMINISCENT OF THE BOOK OF PSALMS,"The spiritual growth, maturity, and transparency that shine through in Kirk Franklin's public appearances of late are indicative of the personal discipling he's experienced at the hands of the Lord and the Lord's servant. This maturity comes through in a greater sense of humility and honesty, less focus on self, and a hunger for holiness and righteousness. All that and more comes through in at least 4 songs on this album: #s 4-7. They are powerful, and much like the lament psalms that start you off with tons of pain and sorrow (Interlude and Let It Go) and end up with praise oftentimes and proclamations of deliverance (The Process and Imagine Me). Bro. Kirk, continue to grow in the grace and knowledge of the Lord, and your music will be more ministry and less club beats (though I am not opposed to upbeat stuff)."
5,Wonderful,"Kirk Franklin's new cd ""Hero"" is one of the best I think he's ever made!The other ones have been good, but I think this is one of the best, it'sso inspiring and so spiritual! I would recommend it to everyone!"
5,Surprised,"I wasn't necessarily a Kirk Franklin fan, before this album, however, this album convinced me that he was worth listening to."
5,Super!! Great!! Fabulous!! Best Ever Kirk Franklin Project!!!,"Okay, I've always liked Kirk Franklin, but this ""Hero"" CD, sets him in a class all by himself. Kirk you totally went beyond....and by doing so you are going to touch so many people with this project. I appreciate you being real and I believe that many people will receive deliverance because you showed your human side. There is something on this CD for everybody. This is the absolute best project I have EVER heard. Kirk reaches people from every walk of life. Thank you for sharing and pouring your heart into this CD project. And you sound so good on that song with Stevie, you go boy...."
5,AMAZING,"I think this is one of the best gospel albumns I've heard. It is honest, poignant and Christ-centered. The songs offer messages of encouragement, hope and perseverance in the face of obstacles. I especially appreciate the fact that this albumn is theme-centered. It begins with our search for Christ and the baggage we bring into our relationship with Him and ends with a message of redemption and the believer's joy in the Lord. If you buy one gospel albumn this year, let it be this one."
4,We need a hero,"Kirk Franklin may not be the hottest thing in gospel anymore but he delivers another great album. While I prefer his older '90s albums more, I still liked a lot of these songs, especially the moving ""Imagine Me"". I didn't care for ""Looking For You"", though: I'm a big Patrice Rushen fan and I dislike the way they butchered ""Haven't You Heard"" for that song."
3,I Loved This CD Until...,"When I first bought this CD, I kept it in my CD player rotation for days on end. However, as time has gone on, I've learned just how much secular music there is in this project. So, that cuts out a significant chunk of the CD that I would listen to.I think that the VERY POWERFUL, FROM-THE-HEART, LIFE-IMPACTING LYRICS could have carried just as well or better without the secular stuff mixed in.Given this, Hero is somewhat of a letdown compared to Rebirth or some of his very early stuff with the Family."
1,Do not buy this CD,Copy protected CDs place malicious software on your PC. Do not buy this software!
3,nice album,Well i have to say i am a young college student and i don't attend church as much as i should. I recently picked up this album a few days ago beucase i host a morning show on my collge radio station on sunday mornings. This cd won me over and i have been singing these songs this album everyday. I can't compare the cds to kirk's early work although i have noticed differences just from hearing various songs of his through out the years. but i would recommend this album. I did notice that kirk is not talking all over the songs on this cd and yu get the chance to hear the the lyrics and hear the singers. If you are looking for the same kirk that appeared in the earlier cds yu might be dissapointed becuase this whole album has a fresh feel and he is talking about some issues. With time things change and i think kirk has evolved since his stomp days.
4,Review of Kirk's album,"The only reason why I did not give this album 5 stars is because there were just not enough pure worship songs on the album. Kirk shares much of his testimony on the album, which is inspiring and empowering. I must say that I admire him for his transparency, for it speaks to his authenticity as a Christian. However, I found that the shortage of songs that solely meditated on the power of God and His Word detracted from this album's potential to really draw more people to Christ and to edify those who are already in Christ. Nonetheless, I sincerely believe that Hero is a ""must have"" in your Christian music library because Kirk is an awesome songwriter and musician. Hence, though I did not ""feel"" certain songs, I do not even deny their potential to minister to someone else."
5,Flawless,"I am not going to write much except to say this album has it all: Praise, Worship, Transformation, Brokeness, Restoration, Healing, and Rejoicing. You could not ask for more. Every song is uplifting and encouraging, even the songs that are more geared towards the hurts of the past lift you in their message for us to ""Let It Out"" and let it go. He is a writer extraodinare. I can tell every song was written with prayer, tears, and much seeking of God's face. A++++++++++++++++++"
5,Get crunk with Christ on this album Hero!,"The man is back!Kirk Franklin and his group steps up to the plate with his new project,Hero.Kirk Franklin's Hero album is better than Kirk's previous albums like The Rebirth of Kirk Franklin and Whatcha Lookin'4.With songs like the smash hit,""Lookin'for you"",""Imagine Me"",""Keep your head"",""Let It Go"",""Could've Been Me"",""Brokenhearted"",""Why"",""First Love"",and ""Sunshine.If you do not have this CD,you are missing out.Go get this CD right now!"
4,Great,"Kirk Franklin Did an awsome job with this project. I find myself playing the tracts over and over again and i will never be tired of them. all of the songs are hype and i would recommend that people bye the cd its very touching to the spirit and mind. I dont have a specific fav on the album, but songs as ""Hero"", ""Imagine"", ""Keep your Head"" and Looking for you of course and first love. that song is just soothing.Thumbs Up"
5,Without you lifes a song with no end...,I will be listening to Hero for the first time in my apartment tomorrow. Can't wait to experience the transition of Kirk.
5,What NEXT Kirk?,I love this CD . . . Kirk Franklin takes it to another level . . . how high you gonna take us Kirk?The way that God uses him is wonderful and i can't wait until the next CD to come out!!
5,WORTH THE WAIT,"It's been a minute between Kirk's Cd's but wow was this worth the wait. From Looking for you to Keep your head which is a remake of the Earth Wind & Fire classic, which Kirk took to a whole new level. This Cd bangs from beginning to end and there are messages here that everyone can relate to from sometime in there lives. This is a must buy."
3,It's Okay,"I listened to this CD quite a few times and it's not like the old Kirk CD's where you can play it over and over again. I like a few of the songs like ""Looking for You"" and ""Could've been Me."" They are pretty good but as overall review of the CD I like his old stuff the best. This CD is also missing theh slow songs that I'm used to from Kirk. His slow songs minister to my soul but the ones on this CD just didn't do that. However, the songs have meaning but they are not like ""We are Conquerors"" or ""Don't take your Joy Away."" All of his good old CD's has songs on their that just made you cry, praise and uplift the name of Jesus. Oh well, but I'm glad to hear from him anyway."
1,Not in the same league as Rebirth !!!!!!!!!,"Coming after Rebirth, an excellent piece of work, this album seriously lacks quality. I was very disappointed to find only three songs worth my listening effort. Looking at other reviews I couldn't help wondering if we were all listening to the same album. Apart from ""Brokenhearted"", which of these songs come close in content to ""My Life, My Love, My All"" or ""Brighter Day""? These songs lack depth. They are even worst than the first album, ""Why We Sing"". I think that right now there is a serious void for well-written songs that connect with the soul and usher you into the very presence of God. We seem to be getting more hype than substance. Artists seem to be working more with the clock than the Holy Spirit. I am praying for Kirk."
1,Copy-protection is the work of the devil!,"How ironic that this ""gospel"" CD is copy-protected, since we all know that CDs loaded with such software are the evil work of greedy label executives desperate to stop CD sales from falling. Kirk is ok, but there's no way in high heaven I'd ever pay money for a CD I can't DIRECTLY rip to my iPod. No sale."
5,Excellent book for students,"This is an excellent book for the studying ecologist or field biologist, a professional would certainly want more, such as Techniques for Wildlife Investigation and Management by the Wildlife Society. This handbook is just that and it offers the basics for just about any survey. For undergraduates interested in independent studies or grad students just getting started, this is your book. It will guide you through everything from sampling techniques based on specific classes (ie fishes, amphibians, etc.) to statistical analysis and common errors."
2,"Unrealistic, and purely fiction.",This book was very simple. There really wasn't reference to the Bible in many areas where there should have been. I would find myself really enjoying parts of the book. Then there would be the letdown because of the simple nature that it was written in.
3,Apocalypse According to Pat,"I read evangelist Pat Robertson's ""The End of the Age."" Not bad for a first novel.Revelation's Beast and False Prophet were American politicians allied with a UN type world government. No richly crafted characters here, just caricatures-Valery is Hillary Clinton, and a dumb movie-actor [Ronald Regan?] was in the White House for a while.Not recommended for liberals."
4,Worth the reading time!,"The book is very interesting in how it shows how the ""last days"" in the Bible could be fulfilled in modern times. Many things in it (the asteroid that crashes into the ocean) are very plausible and Mr. Robertson shows how drastically our way of life can change in an instant. Mr. Robertson also did a good job in working in current personalities and events into the book's texture. The book's main problem is the one-dimensional aspect that afflict many of the characters. However, with that being said, I still think it's worth a read and even having a film version being made (I'd love to see a film version of the battle that takes place toward the end of the book between Christian military forces with angels on their side and the legions of the anti-christ)."
1,The [worst book] since Moby Dick took a walk.,"This book is nothing but a hodge-podge of typical right-wing Christian paranoia. The characters are flat, and the plot is predictable... Don't bother reading this ignorant trash."
2,"Go get 'em, God!","A f-a-s-t read. This books starts off detailed, exciting, and promising, but fizzles out at the end. Was a little disappointed by the last 75 pages. I get the feeling the author wanted to wrap things up quickly. Or maybe he didn' t realize what a story he had originally started here. I admit I would like to have seen more of the Throneberrys and the sole surviving family of the off-Cali comet disaster. I can still recommend this book because it is Revelation based, and reads quick."
1,As a child would tell it.,"This book is written as if written by a child. Bare in mind that im no fan of Pat Robertson himself, (seeing that he scares more would-be christians away is kind of insulting to my religion.)Even taking that into account, and tried to give him the benefit of the doubt as a writer. Im sorry i ever did, this is the poorest written book on the planet. How he got this past his editors (if indeed he HAS editors) is beyond me. The book concept was great, ill give him that, but this needed much revision before it got published."
5,Thought provoking,"I first read this book about 2 years ago. I've been passing it around ever since. It is a great book to start non-Christians thinking. It's simple, and that's where it's strength lies. Two years ago my husband (who said that the Bible was a man-made book and that people evolved from fish), read the book and began thinking. He then started to bring the book to work, lending it out to co-workers. Finally, last fall he was baptized. So no, it's not the greatest literary work ever published, but it certainly was the best investment in a book that we ever made."
3,THIS STORY IS MORE REAL NOW THAN 13-14 YEARS AGO WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT. PLEASE READ REVELATION Chpt 8 verses 8-11 DAVID H,THE HOLY BIBLE ( BOOK OF REVELATIONS CHPT 8 ) CONFIRMS THIS IS COMINGALONG WITH MASSIVE ADDL EARTHQUAKES WORLD WIDE.WATCH OUT. OR - AT LEAST READ THIS BOOKDAVID HUNT RICHMOND VA.23229
4,High Concept and High Entertainment,"The book's concept reminds one of Stephen King's ""The Stand"": apopcalyptic events leading to a battle between good and evil among the survivors. Even though King's version was less overtly theistic, we still know who we're talking about here. Robertson's character development could stand some further depth, and there are some unexplained gaps (such as why the Union for Peace didn't move sooner against the Western Defense Zone), these didn't detract from my enjoyment. A much better meteor story than the ""Armageddon"" movie--at least there was a point to it."
2,it does not work,The quality of this '61 language' CD is pathetic.There is very little information per language and thereis no way you will learn anything from this.
2,And God Created Rebecca De Mornay,"AND GOD CREATED WOMAN is a remake of the classic Bridgett Bardot film but in title only. The movie is pretty predictable, so it is only saved by just having Rebecca De Mornay heating up the screen. There is a hilarious chain of events near the beginning of the film. She escapes from a women's prison, hitchhikes a ride (from a man played by Frank Langella in the car), and the vehicle ends up at the prison she's escaped from. So, she has to sneak back into prison without being noticed. A contractor (Vincent Spano) helps her out while he's working on some construction in the prison gymnasium...The rest of the plot is not very memorable as she tries to start her own rock band when she's paroled and must sacrifice integrity and her marriage to get to the top etc. Overall, a movie that was made to showcase the ""talents"" of Ms. DeMornay and nothing else."
4,Somewhere between a guilty pleasure and an underrated gem,"If you can forget the whole remake thing, this is a somewhat involving movie, with interesting plot twists, a great performance by De Mornay, nice supporting performances, interesting if corny character development, a nice sound track, Vadim's strange but unique visual style and it's very sexy. What more do you want? I think as time goes on and a new generation stumbles on this flick free from the hype about it being a remake of a ""classic"" it will be appreciated more and more as a nice offbeat B movie melodrama with lots of sex, some nice humor and beautiful photography."
4,For Rebecca DeMornay Fans Only,"If you were hooked by Rebecca De Mornay's sexiness in Risky Business (like I was), this movie is for you. She is so beautiful and voraciously sexual throughout. The story has a few flaws (she nearly has her parole revoked for being photographed having sex with her husband??) but it is a worthwhile vehicle for doing what she does so well."
3,And God Created Women,"And God Created WomanNot a very good movie at all but Rebecca DeMornay looks her best in this movie. Also, she has one of the best sex scenes EVER early in this movie. That sex scene alone makes this movie worth it."
4,Rebecca DeMornay,This is one of my favorite movies from the 80s. Rebecca DeMornay is hot in this remake of the Roger Vadim 50s classic.
4,A Guilty Pleasure From My Twenties.,"This movie isn't particularly good--it's a basic marriage of convenience and cheating tupperware party. It's still got great, funny moments even if it doesn't always make sense, but I wouldn't thumb my nose at it. I never saw the original nor, until looking up these reviews, did I even know there was one. Rebecca DeMornay is always beautiful, and her performance is actually quite hilarious in places. The situations are outrageous, and Vincent Spano is nice eye candy if not much else. Donovan Leitch's son also turns in a solid supporting role performance.Sure, this movie is shallow, silly, raunchy, and totally 80s, but that's what makes it so much fun. A great guilty pleasure with a decent music sountrack, 80s movie buffs should really like this one, because it fits all the typical criteria."
3,Won't play on my Bose system,"This is the only DVD that will not play on my Bose system. Strange. Otherwise the work outs are good but be ready for a very fast ""gym"" feel pace to it."
4,didn't know I was working out,"I really enjoyed this 30 day workout, since I enjoy Yoga but also getting my sweat on this was perfect. I streached and worked my way to a toner body. At the end I did feel as I had went thru a major streach, but woke up the next morning feeling the muscle ach! LOVE IT!"
1,Not for Beginners,"This is not a DVD for beginners. This is like a master's class in core sculpting. If you are just getting on the fitness/yoga bus, let this one pass you by."
5,GREAT TOOL FOR HILLERMAN LOVERS,"If you enjoy having as many details as possible when you read Tony H's wonderful Leaphorn/Chee sagas, this map will help you have a much better sense of the stories. I now keep it with whichever book I am reading, so I may recall where the various settings are in relation to one another. WORTH THE SMALL EXPENSE!"
1,LOTS OF FUN -- until it breaks.,"I bought this toy for my four kids (2-5). We used it twice, it worked great!! Even the 2 year-olds loved it. Then it broke. The volcano quit working. I wrote to Hasbro for a replacement part, product, anything to get it working again. They wrote back -- ""can't be fixed, no replacement."" So they sent me a replacement toy, one supposedly of equal value. A furreal cat. Not a water toy. My boys were not impressed. If they ever could get it fixed so this toy actual works, it would be a great toy. Stay clear of it for this year. Maybe next year they will figure out how to make it last all summer. Let's hope so."
1,Mt. Breaki Breaki,Well so far we've gone thru 2 of these. Both times the rubber bladder has cracked. AVOID AVOID AVOID!!! JUNK JUNK JUNK!!!
3,great toy but at more than $200 buy a slide,"Mt tiki soki is great. It retailed for about $20 when hasbro made it. Now it is discontinued and the prices of greater than $100 and up are insane. This is a sprinkler! It is not that durable. Mine lasted for about 3 months. I would get another one for $20, but $200 no way!"
2,Loved it while it lasted,"My 3yr old LOVED this! He laughed so hard whenever it blew it's top. Then, after the first day, it stopped working. Thinking it was a fluke, I had my dad buy it when we visited. It blew it's top 3-4 times before the canister inside that store up the water ruptured. So as fun as it was, we had two in a row work for just one day of play."
5,It soaks you!,This toy soaks you! You can spend hours and hours of playing.The water shoots up more than 15 feet high! This toy is veryeasy to set up. This is a great toy to play with in the summer!
5,so much fun,"i bought this 6 weeks ago for my 4 yr old nephew. he has liked it and brought it when he came to visit this weekend. my kids (3-6-8) all had a blast and i was cracking up watching them. they were very imaginative with it-pretending to have been covered in lava and then putting out each other's fires. the older kids had fun putting beachballs, frisbees, etc... on top to see them blast up. the 4 kids manhandled it, and it kept on going."
2,Fun - for a while,This toy is great fun but it isn't very durable. Ours broke after about an hour. There was a loud pop and then it stopped erupting. I guess the plastic bladder must have given out. The kids were terribly disappointed.
1,Save your money!,"This was a huge disappointment! The eruption never took place, and while the children stood around waiting the spray coming out of the sides was comparable to a pinhole in a waterhose! An incredible waste of money - we got more enjoyment out of the sprinkler system installed to water our lawn!"
2,This toy may break when you first use it.,It never worked.We belevied it was used so heres the most hardest thing ever.Were getting a new one!=)
1,Water Volcano,"Despite reading bad reviews, I took a chance and purchased this item. I got the first one, hooked it up and it quit working within two hours. Ordered a second, it quits working within the hour. I should have known better as others have posted the same experience. Great concept, maybe they will get the actual product correct in the next year. Please don't waste your time on this one now....."
2,Timid Tots...BEWARE of Tikisoki!,"My 3-yr. old and I are very disappointed in this toy. While the jets get great height and provide a nice ""soak"", she found the surprise element of waiting for the next eruption very discomforting. It was the surprise effect that attracted me to it in the first place, and I quickly discovered that the timing is predictable (every 5 seconds)...making it easy for older kids to grow tired of it quickly. This toy may only be perfect for anyone 4-6 years old--not exactly a large window for families using this with more than one child."
1,Best Secrets For Catching More Fish,The DVD was bad. Sent back and was refunded full price. Had no problems with Amazon.
3,Not as durable as other Maisy flap books,"I have a 13-month old, and she's had a couple of Maisy flap books (""Where does Maisy Live"" and ""Where is Maisy"") for a long time. What I like about those is how durable the flaps are.This book doesn't have as durable of flaps. They're not bad, but there is one page in particular (lots of little flaps), where my baby tore about 3 flaps off instantly. I also think it's a little misleading because it says it has a lot of flaps (which is true), but one page has a lot of little flaps covering the same 5 or 6 things, so it's not quite as cool as I thought it'd be.That said, my baby does enjoy the book; however, I would also say that it's geared for an older child than the other two books I noted above. Some of the concepts would be better for a 2 or 3-year old. All in all, I would say this book is worth buying, but don't expect it to be a larger version of ""Where does Maisy Live"" or ""Where is Maisy""."
5,Fun!,"My daughter is one, so she is a little young for the target demographic of this book. She does however really enjoy it. This book is played with multiple times a day. She enjoys turning the large pages and lifting all of the flaps. My only qualm with this book is, that although it is large in size, it is not have many pages. Overall though a great book and I'm sure my daughter will enjoy it even more when she is old enough to really interact with it."
2,Amazon blew it!,"I placed an order for this product about Dec 3, 2007. On Dec 6, 2007, I was notified that the book had been shipped, and my credit card was charged. It was shipped via USPS, with an estimated arrival date of Dec 12, 2007. This was great since it was to be a Christmas gift. When it did not arrive, and the USPS did not have tracking information, I called Amazon. Their representative, Ahish, assured me it would be replaced and would arrive by Dec 19, 2007; still in plenty of time for Christmas.Needless to say it did not arrive on Dec 19. It was finally delivered on Jan 25, 2008. Amazon would not reverse the charge on my credit card, and would not expedite the shipment. This is a completely unsatisfactory way to do business!!"
2,too expensive,"Well , it works withthe printed documents , works really well but it is too expensive fot its purpose"
1,Not what it looked like,"I thought this book would come with the plans inside, based on the title and subtitle. But it is just a book of plans to order. There are no plant keys, just sketches of various landscaping plans that you can send away for. I am completely dissatisfied and would like to return this item."
2,This is a marketing book,"This book has a bunch of very specific plans for designs that you must BUY. While you can get a few ideas from it, it is very vague and general, and yet, geared to a specific-lot plan. Browse it if you like, but don't bother to buy it."
4,Excellent book,"My dad recommended me this book and I love it. It is thought provoking and interesting. The reading is a little bit complex and probably you will have to read a sentence more than once to understand it, but it is totally worth it."
2,Not what I asked,"I requested the English version of the ""hombre mediocre."" I returned it the first one and the second I received it was again in Spanish. If you put the name in English of the book it has to be in English, no Spanish."
3,An odious read,"I found this book very hard to parse. It's written in an archaic style. I'm sure there are much better books on logic around. Note that I haven't finished it (for the reasons above), so take my review lightly."
4,peter scolari,"i didn't see this video that's why i want to order it but you don't send to the France. I want to see this video only to see Peter Scolari and Tom Hanks dressed in WOMEN. I want this video and i just ask you if there are somebody to send me ""BOSOM BUDDIES vol 1"". I can pay in traveler check, I can pay the sending. Please if there are somebody who can help me i accept all proposition. Thanks you very much Sihem Annane e-mail : pretender_26@yahoo.com"
5,GREAT book...great price...,Thank you for the opportunity to buy this book at a great price. The quality of it as a second hand book is good...and the book itself is full of wonderful information. Thanks again
5,80's punk blues / glam,"I havent recieved this item yet but it is definately one of the best album and band to date in this century. It has every aspect of the 80's sunset scene. Dangerous, sleazy, and fast it is an amazing album. Im excited to be getting this up front. -Rest in Sleaze Dave lepard "" if u were alive u would influence a generation..."
4,Be Careful with the handle,"Overall I love this carseat but I found out today that I have been driving around with the handle in the wrong position. I have kept the handle in what the instructions refer to as the A position which is also the setting that you carry the seat in. After speaking to a police officer recently trained and certified in car seat installation/safety, he said the handle absolutely needs to be as far back as possible and provided a very strong arguement why. The manual that came with the seat is very ambiguous and does not specifically say this at all. I called Graco and suggested that this statement be added to the book for safety concerns and she argued that the seat was ""tested"" with the handle being up and it was fine.The officer I spoke to was adament that an infant could be in GRAVE danger if the handle is up in a crash. I think I am going to believe the police officer vs. the manufacturer!"
5,Beautiful Car Seat,"This car seat is the best. I recommend it to everyone that is having a girl. I also recommend the Lindsey stroller. They both match and the car seat attaches perfectly onto the stroller. I paid $99.99 and it's worth it. Very light to carry. Easy to attach onto the Lindsey stroller. I'm glad Graco is making things more beatiful, safe, and easy to assemble. The color is not brite but the perfect pink mix with white. Bravo Graco!"
3,Not as thrilled as I thought I would be,"The color coordination was off on each piece I purchased, had baby pink but then was more red on the stripes portion. I like GRACO so I went with the Mary Ann version pink/grey much nicer set and was a few bucks less."
3,My baby hates this car seat,My baby came a little earlier than expected a week before my shower so this was not my first choice. My husband made a mad dash to Babies R Us to pick this up I think he chose it because of the color. Well My baby hates it she cries non stop in this carrier mind you I have been blessed with a realitivly quiet baby but put her in this car seat and she is screaming like someone is killing her. She is tiny and her neck flops forward even with the extra head and neck cushion we bought her. She just looks uncomfortable in this. I would not recommend it if you have a choice. I gave it a 3 because I have not heard or read and bad safety reviews.
2,"Cute infant chair, but....","It is a very cute and girly looking infant seat. But, it is too big to fit behind the drivers seat when my husband is driving our SUV.(He hates the Graco brand of infant seat. We had an Evenflo one before this that was alot lighter & was much easier to get in & out, and onto the base.) The Graco chair is also heavy & quite dfficult to lift up into the base. It can barely fit in through the back door of my ESV!(I drive an ESV & I am only 5'2"", so that may be part of it!) But, over all, it gets alot of compliments from people because it is so cute & pink! Even if it is big & heavy, and hard to carry around!"
3,22 LBS comes quickly!!!,"This car seat is so precious! I love the color and style. It's safe and when my daughter was in it, she looked super cozy. Keeping it clean was a breeze; it was ALMOST PERFECT. The only problem was that my daughter outgrew it in less than a year! As a first-time-mom, I thought a car seat would last until it was ""toddler seat"" time, but now I have to spend a few more hundred dollars getting her a new seat! It's still in perfect condition but it's useless now."
4,Heartwarming,"So many lessons in this story - history, geography, medicine, and the indomitable spirit of man and dog."
3,Balto review,My students enjoyed the book and it tied nicely into our unit on Alaskan sled dogs. Good history tie in as well.
1,Why would anyone make this?,Seriously terrible. Why listen to some noname chick crappily sing Fiona songs when we can listen to Fiona herself? Run from this one!
3,Copy Cat Versions of Fiona Songs,"I heard clips of these songs on another website. They are mostly from the Extraordinary Machine album. Although it's listed as ""various artists"", it all seems to be sung by the same female singer, who has quite a nice voice. Since the arrangements are virtually identical to the originals, the obvious question is why anyone would listen to these, when they could listen to Fiona sing them."
1,She is no apple,"Not sure why this album was made. She is not famous. She is not Great, and she pale's in comparason to the real Apple."
1,Hurry ! There's only ONE left in stock !,"Seriously, WHO would pay 11 bucks for a remake of Apples songs ?This is truly baffling to me."
2,Not much for Mac Users,"The book offers a wealth of information for PC users, but unlike the many very common guides which include illustrations for both Mac and PC formats, only 3 of this book's 200+ pages offer specific guidance for Mac-users.Samples, examples, and illustrations are of the authors' favorite PC Programs while only mentioning Mac options on one or two pages.I will offer that theory, practice, and concept are pretty thorough but as for practicality for Mac Users, I beg, please guys... do a Mac version."
3,Maybe,Some may find this book of use but it didn't help me much. I'm going to try the Nero 6 book even though the reviews aren't that great. Hopefully it will get me more detailed help in using the Nero filters.
1,Reality check,"This is quite possibly the worst video reference on racing and going fast every created. While most of the information presented by those interviewed is accurate, there are a lot of opinions tossed around as fact and never backed up. You can excuse a race driver for this, but not a film producer. To make matters worse, the voice over commentary is simply wrong and incorrect throughout the entire film. In fact, there are several instances of the commentator directly contradicting those being interviewed, while offering their comments as evidence to back his blatantly absurd claims. If it weren't for the serious tone I'd think this was a joke. The producer has obviously never gone fast. Hell, he likely has never driven. The commentator is equally clueless, or hard up for a job and just doesn't care about getting things right. If I could unwatch this video, I would."
1,doesn't work,"I purchased this product after reading about ADD and ADHD which I believe my son has. His teacher said he was more restless than usual when I put him on this product. Maybe he just reacted badly, but it didn't work for us."
1,didn't hold up to expecations,"did the opposite of calming, felt like I need to run laps, just wound me up more. Not worth the money"
1,Does not work for LI-12B,I bought this to take with me on vacation to supplement the charger that came with my camera. I put a battery into both the real olympus charger and this item. THe olympus charger had it done and ready to go as normal. I thought the other one was ready and pulled it out and put it into the camera. Didn't work. So I charged another battery in the real olympus charger and returned this one to this charger. Olympus battery charged. This item didn't charge. I have asked for a refund or to be sent a REAL olympus LI-12B charger.
4,Really nice shirt,"I got this shirt for my daughter for the holidays and she just loves it. It has nice materials, and the picture was really cute. A good buy for that anime fan in your life."
3,A Bit Too Fixated On...,"I was interested in this series because the parish the book revolved around is from where my grandmother hailed. I found the historical fiction portion interesting, however I thought the author was a bit too fixated on sex and sexual issues. Obviously it was a component of their lives, but he included it too often and in unnecessary places."
2,"Interesting, but plodding in the 2nd half","Interesting story; good description of Swedish society in the era, but the story downright plods during the ship passage to America. Would have been better if Moberg had made that relatively boring passage shorter and moved on past the landing in this part of the series. He spends a lot of pages describing the hopes and fears of each of the emigrants in the group; too much, in my opinion. This 1st novel in the series did not inspire me to get the rest and continue reading the entire story."
4,Good movie,"This is a classic anime movie from the old days full of horror, some sex, and of course tons of violence"
5,It works for selling Amway too!,"I found this book very helpful in not only making believers out of non-believers, but sending my Amway conversions through the frigg'in roof! I closed my poor aunt Selma four months and now she's putting $2k/month into my pocket today. Gold mine baby (or should I say TOUCHDOWN JESUS!)"
3,Almost a good deal,"The motor on this regulator setup is faced the wrong direction for my application (92 fj80). I made it work, but had to trim some metal. I bought it for 29 bucks, then the price went up to 80. Not worth it at 80 dollars."
4,Relief From Symptoms,"I have suffered from debilitating cramps and PMS symptoms every since I was a pre-teen, both of which are aggravated by ovarian cysts. I started drinking this tea a few years ago and it has offered me considerable relief of my symptoms without drugging myself into oblivion with OTC painkillers. I find this tea works best if it is drunk throughout the month, and upping to 2 cups a day right as symptoms start. However, it doesn't do too well in stopping symptoms once they start."
5,I miss Salvador!,I first heard these group of guys at Spirit West Coast and ever since love their music. I hope I hear more Christian music with a salsa flavor!
2,poorly written drivel,When I got this book I was hoping for something special. It is'nt. Good thing he uses it for his own class. I don't think anyone else should/would buy it.
5,This CD is simply... the balls.,"Please people, for your own well being, DO NOT SLEEP ON THIS ALBUM. I've listened to a lot of hip hop and have grown tired of the repetiive garbage thats bein thrown in our faces on tv and through radio, so have mainly gone the independant route the last couple of years and this album is by far the most rounded, complete cd i've listened to in a long time. There isnt one weak track production wise, with different variety on every song, and if you enjoy listening to music and lyrics that actually inspires you to think and not the nonsense thats gettin airplay these days, I beg of you, buy this bad boy. The message that comes across in their music is a breath of fresh air given the state of hip hop these days. If you are a rap fan, and dont own this priceless gem, you should be ashamed of yourself. I guarentee you wont be dissapointed. Also was lucky enough to see them in concert in Vancouver recently and they rocked man. Great live act. Keep on truckin fellas."
4,GOod Stuff,"I picked this CD up after a few weeks of anticipation. At first I was like ""oooh man, should have bought that from autumn to ashes cd"", but after listening to it it has grown on me. I would have to say the other two cds are still better but this one is a solid release. I would still recommend."
5,WOW !,"This film made me sorry that I didn't get to NY to see The Gates. I'm not sure it is art, but it sure is wonderful!God bless Christo and Jean-Claud!"
2,album great recording not,I used to love this album and was happy to see it on CD finally. I was not so happy once I heard it however. This CD is so hollow and tinny sounding that it sounds like it was recorded in a tunnel - or with a tin can and strings. Not sure how they messed up this transfer but mess it up they did.
5,My Rome Guide,"The video was really great. We watched it several times before departing for our trip to Rome, and it really gave us great insight into selecting what we wanted to see while there, so we didn't waste any time. Additionally, their web site, which is provided with the DVD, was extremely helpful with answering any and all questions I sent them. I must have sent them 10 e-mails with questions to help me on the trip, and they responded to each and every one, within no more than a day, and the response was usually a full page or two. Really great."
4,Boat installation...works 4.0!,"Easy to install, had no leak issue or fitment problems. Installed on a Universal M-25 engine. Allowed use of a larger filter for better capacity and flow. Follow the instructions, don't overtighten the fittings, and use good pipe thread compound. It has been on the boat since October. I am changing the oil again after this weekend, so any changes will be noted then."
3,Body lotion,"I have used this lotion for years and I ordered some more as you can not buy it at any store. Amazon is a great web site to order anything, but when I received it the picture of it is totally different as is the lotion. I believe they updated the bottle but I was alittle disappointed in the product inside as it was not as rich and thick as I remembered but I will use it anyways. Please go back to the orginial formula.."
4,Not Bizarre at all,"I bought this book in spite of the other review saying it was ""bizarre"". Of course, a basic underdstanding of anthroposophy would help, but having read about 20 books and many research articles on the lastest developments in the findings about autism and its treatments, I found this book did not contradict any of it. In fact, I was quite surprised at how up to date this book was, considering how anthropopshy is 100 years old. It is one star short of 5, because I would have liked to have had less theory and more practical help."
1,hardly any content,"This book is most definitely not ""advanced"". It combines the most simple elements of gone-west tantra with an extremely naive ""understanding"" of the Qabalah. All information relevant for practice could have been compressed to two or three pages. (It has, in other books.)At least the ""Tree of Ecstasy"" could be of use for a well-protected introduction into the ""infamous"" topic of sexual magic."
4,"Good, but the McGegan is better.","Next to Giulio Cesare, Alcina and Orlando, Ariodante is one of Handel's finest operas. The music is exquisite and the plot is nos as silly as in other Baroque operas. We have 2 very desirable recordings of Ariodante> this one and a slightly older one in Harmonia Mundi which won a Gramophone Award for best Baroque Vocal recording. The main drawback of the Archiv recording is Minkowski's nervous conducting, sometimes it's just too fast for its own good (and the singers). Anne-Sofie von Otter sings mostly very well, but I think Lorraine Hunt has an even better sense of style and a voice just as good. The main advantage of the Archiv over the HM is the Ginevra of Lynne Dawson, marvelous performance. But HM has a better orchestra in the Freiburger Barockorchester, one of the choicest period bands around. Both recordings are good and I certainly would want both, but if forced to choose, the McGegan is the more natural and beautiful Ariodante to be had."
2,Why the embarrassment over being known as a grandparent?,"I didn't like the book's emphasis on being embarrassed about being a grandparent. There was a lot of stuff about being humiliated about seeming old when the child calls out ""grandma."" But the author goes on to assure her own kids that this doesn't mean anything, she loves the grandchild, just doesn't want anyone to know it's her grandchild.This is hurtful to the child, no matter what the author says. The grandparents' vanity is more important to the grandparent than the child's feelings."
2,This episode gets a C- grade and is ranked 64th out of 80,"The U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701 comes to the planet Ardana to acquire zienite, a rare mineral needed to stop a planet-wide plague on Merak II. The zienite is not available, however, because the miner class Troglytes are rebelling against the rulers of Ardana, who live in the cloud-city of Stratos. The Stratos-dwellers insist that the Troglytes are naturally inferior beings, but Kirk discovers that the Troglytes are being affected by a gas emitted during mining. Unable to get both sides to settle their differences, Kirk traps the Troglyte leader Vanna and the High Advisor of Ardana's Ruling Council, Plasus, inside a mine. When the gas takes effect, Plasus realizes what is happening and promises to help the Troglytes. With peace restored, the U.S.S. Enterprise is able to secure the zienite it needs."
5,"Well-written, well-researched account","This book is by an author who most, most obviously knows his stuff. It is everything you WEREN'T taught (but, should have been) about ""the Triangle Slave Trade"" in your high school history class. Amazingly documented history that might make you cringe.... if you are human, that is."
4,Greta is a Great Talent,"This second CD is not quite as strong as her first, but still excellent. Gaines makes music that Sheryl Crowe and Lucinda Williams wish they could make. Highly recommended, hope her career gets a boost somewhere so she can get a bigger exposure. You have to go to her website to get these titles now."
4,An Amazing Pre-Code!,"""Baby Face"" is one of the most important pre-code movies. It is amazingly honest and brave in depicting the story of a destitute girl trying to climb to the top. Barbara Stanwyck is simply great in her portrayal of the main character. Hard to imagine any other actress capable of such a magnificent performance. It is very sad that because of the Hayes code instituted in 1934 and that lasted for over thirty years, the great movie traditions of the amazing pre-code movies have been completely lost. It seems that the best of the pre-code movies that have not dated in seventy plus years, have been created in another universe. There is nothing like this in the modern movie making. The only thing that I did not like in the movie was the ending. It seemed contrived and added, probably, at the insistance of the people in charge to soften the harshness of the movie's message."
5,"The real ""Working Girl""","Great pre-code (for that matter, brought-on-the-code) little story with vampy little Barbara sleeping her way to the top. The camera pans up the side of the bank with each new conquest; too bad the last scenes are a bit of a letdown. But it starts the tradition of Stanwyk going off on a guy, whether it be father (here), lover (Double Indemnity), or husband (Insert movie name here).Great fun; I hope they put this one on DVD soon- the sight of John Wayne is worth the price of admission alone- it proves, that, yes, he did grow as an actor, as scary as that is."
1,"Boring, Repetitive and Predictable!","Wow, I love old classic movies but this one proved to me that just because a move is old and considered a classic doesn't mean it's a good movie! Pre-code or not this movie was awful! I like Barbara Stanwyck but this B Movie was obviously made before she became a big Hollywood star and started getting more quality scripts! The movie was boring, repetitive and predictable! It was the same old thing, she seduced a guy, some little tune would play and she would be doing the same thing to another guy and you knew it would all lead to some kind of tragedy! What exactly is it about this movie that people like? I just don't get it, I kind of think the only reason people like Baby Face is because it's Pre-Code and had been banned for many years. The forbidden Movie! Sorry but it's just not worth the hype!"
1,Drek!,I tried to watch this movie but it was horrible!What the heck is this drek and why the heck was Barbara Stanwick wasting her magnificent acting talent in it for? I had to turn this movie off halfway through because I just couldn't watch it any more and waste my time by watching this mess!This is pure absolute utter drek!
4,"Not All Are 12"" Versions","Not all tracks are the 12"" version of the great tunes. The title is missleading.""Baby Don't Change Your Mind"" by Gladys Knight & The Pips and ""This Is It"" by Melba Moore are the single versions.The other tracks are the extended versions and make for a great collection. Best cut on this compilation is ""Loving You-Losing You "" by the late Phyllis Hyman. The woman had a voice on her! Check out her other releases you wont be dissapointed."
4,Japanese Style Noodles (Sapporo Ichiban),"These aren't bad noodles, but they're certainly not the greatest. In all honesty, they taste almost exactly like Maruchan's beef flavoured noodles, but a tad bit better. Unlike Shin noodles, it has a lot less sodium in it, for those who have heart trouble. It has roughly half the sodium that Shin has, (Shin having between 30-50% depending on the flavour you get).If you interested in trying some different kind of noodles for some reason or another, then I would recommend trying this."
3,This book was good but definitely not her best,"I enjoyed the book as I do all her books, but I wouldn't say it was her best. However it was worth the read and money."
1,Unsatisfactory read,Poorly crafted. Scenes differ widely from real life scenarios. For example court testimony that rambles on without objection.
5,first time coulter reader,"i picked up a copy of the eleventh hour at a local bookstore a few days ago, i've been wanting to read a catherine coulter book for a few years now, anyway, i read the book in 3 days, which is about average for me, and i really liked the story and the pace of the book! i'll be reading more of the series! i'm looking forward to backtracking to the beginning of the series and working my way through. pick up a copy, you'll enjoy it!"
4,Murder at the Church,"A eyewitness to the murder of a priest, Nicola Jones sees the killer leave the confessional. FBI agent Dana Carver returns to bury his twin bother and find his killer with the help of Dilon Savich and Lacy Sherlock. The ELEVENTH HOUR moves and is the one that drew me into reading more of Catherine Coulter's series. To this reader it is one of the best in the series, when a new TV series hits the air and follows the same events the suspense grows.""Nick"" is under protection as the killer searches to silence her forever. Of course, with all Coulter stories there is a romance to lighten the pages of the hard packed thriller.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS and QUALIFYING LAPS."
2,No depth,"I won't go into detail as it's been done very well by the previous critics. I will say that the author took a potentially interesting character in Nick Jones, the P.H.D. and made her very stupid. I couldn't wait to finish it."
1,It would be hard to make it worse,"I was going to write a fairly long review about this incredibly shallow and poorly-written book -- but I then discovered the review by General Crystal Starr Light ""Galactic Empire"". Every word that reviewer took the time to write is, as we used to say, ""right on"".I would add one more stupidity -- when the police visit the apartment of Valerie Stryker, they enter her living room and see a white couch splattered with what appears at first to be brown paint -- but is later recognized as blood. Then her body is found behind the couch -- and she's been strangled. Hmmmmm. Where'd the blood come from, one wonders.The incredible inconsistencies, lack of continuity and awful, awful childish dialog make this book good for little more than adding weight to a shelf."
3,Solid,"While I enjoyed this book, I have to admit I expected more from a writer of Coulter's caliber. While plot and characterization worked for me, the dialogue was jarringly off-putting. People simply don't talk that way. At some point I began to wonder if two people authored this book: an experienced writer and someone trying his/her hand at dialogue for the very first time.Still, a solid read."
2,I Really Tried To Like This Book,"After reading the story description on the book's jacket, I was truly looking forward to reading this story. However, the more I read, the more I became disappointed with these one dimensional characters and unbelievable coincidences. Two of these incidents occured twice in the story during plot twist, which made me really wish the author had given more thought."
2,Disappointing . . .,"I got through it but . . . The dialog was elementary, the plot devices were contrived, the characters (other than Savich and Sherlock) were not well developed. How disappointing from an author I have always enjoyed."
1,The absolute worst,"I've never read anything this bad, ever! This was the first time I read Coulter's work - can't believe why anyone would be interested, what with the poor plot and the artificial conversation."
2,A Yawner,"Every week I read the NY Times book review and recognize that the same authors always have books on the list. I seldom read these authors [except Grisham] but if everyone else is reading them I figured there had to be something there. So I selected a Catherine Coulter novel and settled in.What I found was a plot that moved along but trite dialog and unimaginative characters. Dane is an FBI agent whose priest twin brother is murdered during a confession. Dane teams up with a supposed street girl named Nick. The cop dialog is simple and the technical details fairly accurate.Very predictable. It appears that this is a formula book. One that will be printed again with different character names, a twist in the plot and a different setting and reprinted under a different title. It will probably sell another half a million copies."
1,Disappointing,"I started reading Catherine Coulter with her Savich books. I find the writing in this book to be of extremely low caliber. It does not flow at all and seems as though she gave it to someone else to write. It does not seem to be her style at all. The descriptions, words, story line all seem to be fake and lacking.I waited a long time for this book and was sorely disappointed."
4,The Eleventh Hour,I like Catherine Coulter stories on the FBI series. I like her writing. I have read all of her books. I had read this book before and enjoyed reading it again on my new kindle.
4,Eleventh Hour,It's easy to get involved with the characters - you are engrossed with the multiple plots and pull for successful conclusions. I am always looking forward to the next book I the FBI series - love Savich and Sherlock.
3,An ok read,"Catherine Coulter can write but this is not the best book that she has written.The plot is interesting because there is more than one story line going through the book.The characters are not as well depicted in this book as some of the others, but if you have gotten interested in the characters with prior reads, you will want to read this one, also.A good book to pass the evening with, it is also a fairly quick read.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
1,Wasted potential,"This author is one that I have tried to remember to avoid, but from time to time I try her again. This story line could have been very effective, but I felt it feel far short. You have trained professionals from the FBI and a woman with a Ph.D engaging in dialogue that sounds like it was written by a teenager and inconsistencies in details that I found very annoying. If the target audience of this book was the under-21 crowd, I suppose it would be passable. I don't believe I will try this author again."
2,Not up to Coulter's standards,"Having read many of Coulter's books, I would not recommend this one as a must read. The plot was actually pretty well devised. However, the dialogue was incredibly unrealistic and the characters were not at all well developed. The protagonists had no depth and that, in turn, had a negative effect on the plot. I expect more from Catherine Coulter."
1,Slow and Boring!,I usually love all Catherine Coulter's books but not this one. I kept coming up with excuses to put it down. It was slow moving not at all what one expects from this talented author. I may try reading the next new book that she writes but I won't spend the money on a hardbound book. I'll wait for the paperback and see if she can redeem herself. Read this book only if you don't have another book in your home and prepare yourself to be bored silly!
2,Fabulous beginning,"Midnight in a Catholic church, a woman is sitting in the shadows of the large sanctuary when she sees a dark-haired man enter to confess his sins to the waiting priest. After a muffled exchange with the kindly father, the ""confessor"" pulls a gun and kills the priest. The woman slumps deeper into the shadows so she's not detected by the killer. Wow! The priest even has an identical twin brother in law enforcement who helps find the perpetrator. I couldn't wait for the next chapter, and the next. Then the story drizzled down to trite, silly, and shallow. Too bad, it had so much promise."
1,This is my last by this author,"Coulter has always been a real hit and miss author for me, but I threw this book down in disgust and I'll never buy another of hers. I know she can write--I've read evidence of that. So there's no excuse but laziness to put out this...tripe. The characters are flat, the dialogue made me laugh out loud--it was so incredibly lame. She gives romantic suspense a bad bad name."
2,Don't Buy!,"I found the writing, plot and characterization amateurish and will not buy any further in the series. However, I plan to still examine her historicals for possible purchase."
1,Give me my money back!,"I have read all of Catherine Coulter's books in the last seven years, and spent a good chunk of money on them. Not only was this one chock full of bad dialogue, gruesome crimes and ridiculous cliches, but it didn't even deliver the cheesy thrills and romance I was expecting!To top it all off, Coulter (perhaps related to Ann?) goes off on several vicious political tangents that really alienated me as a reader. Hey Ms. Coulter, your loyal fans give you hard-earned money for some entertainment, not your own views on how immoral public defenders are (thanks so much) or what you think of the impeachment scandal!Either Ms. Coulter has lost her touch, or she needs to hire a new ghost-writer."
1,A Very Disappointing Book!,"After attempting to read The Target a few months ago, I decided not to waste my money on another Coulter mystery. However, because the cover of Eleventh Hour looked interesting and past books were by Coulter were enjoyable reads (The Maze), I bought the book. I was not able to finish it---and I certainly won't inflict this book on a friend! The characters were weak and one dimensional and the dialogue was stilted, silly and unrealistic. Please, Ms. Coulter--re-read your older books and find out what you're missing now!!"
1,Couldn't even finish it - it was that bad.,"I'm one of those people that have to finish a book once I've started, and I have to say that this was so bad, I just couldn't complete it. Between the poorly developed characters that speak on a first grade level,the lack of a solid plot (well, I guess we could call it a plot), and the author using this work to speak her own political views, I thought it would never end. I just had to give up and toss it aside. Please don't waste your time or money on this one."
3,"Not her best, wait for paperback edition then buy it.","I've read most of Catherine Coulter's books and have recognised her style/formula in each book. Her plots are great. She knows how to do write twists and turns to keep the readers interested despite the sometimes wooden dialogue, uneven character development and stretches of the imagination. Yes, I know that this is a novel and artistic liberties are taken to keep the plot moving but Nick, the civilian homeless heroine, is brought to almost every interview and meeting between FBI agents and witnesses. At times, Nick is portrayed as interesting, educated and brave while at other times as a witless idiot (e.g., her own contribution to one meeting was a comment on the bodyguard's hair color). I much perferred ""The Maze"", ""The Cove"" or ""The Target"" over ""Eleventh Hour""."
1,Not What I Had Hoped,"Well, ...it must be fairly entertaining. Not so with this book, supposedly about FBI operatives. It weaves together- with big, ugly stitches- a story of a FEEB avenging his twin brother/priest's murder, and an utterly predictable LYWIT (that' s Lovely Young Woman in Trouble..."
5,GoldMine,This is my first Catherine Coulter book I have ever read. I have to say I love this book. The storyline was very well-written having Dane Carver's brother killed who happens to be a priest and trying to find killer with the help of Nicola was awesome. The plot was suspenseful full of twists and turns. and I believe you will enjoy this book.
1,Absolutely HORRIBLE!!!!,"The dialogue in this amateurish attempt at a crime thriller is laughable. The characters are flat, the plot predictable, and the dialogue is perfectly tedious. Ms. Coulter's expertise is in historical romance, not in this genre. I would like to ask for my money back on this (audio edition) because it was so horrible. If you want to roll your eyes a lot, check it out from the library. Save your money."
1,Should be the end of this series...,"I have always been an avid Coulter reader, but I don't think so anymore. At least not her FBI books. I loved The Cove and The Maze. The rest of the books have gotten worse with each one. Eleventh Hour seems to have been written by a high school student. The charecters are so wooden, who cares about them? The dialouge at times is so silly and inappropriate, it's downright embarassing. Yes, this will be my last one of this series even if it's not Catherine's. I'm so glad I got this from the library, I would've been upset if I paid money for it."
4,One of Catherine Coulter's best,"A homeless woman, Nick Jones, is befriended by Father Michael Joseph and meets him at the church, but he is in the confessional booth with someone. Suddenly, Nick hears a familiar pop sounds, and becomes the only witness to Father Michael Joesph's killer.It takes days for Nick to get her courage up to speak with the police, and when she finally does, she comes face to face with Father Michael Joseph's twin, Special Agent Dane Carver with the FBI.Dane is trying to find the killer and the witness to his twin's murder. When he first meets a homeless woman and she faints at the sight of him, he ends up taking her with him in protective custody, because the police will not spend the money on a homeless woman. Her presence helps him with the tragedy of the loss of his twin while he searches for a murderer that has patterned his kills from episodes of a new television program. But Nick has her own secret past she doesn't want revealed, for another killer is after her."
2,Cliff Notes,The Cliffs notes were a big help for my daughter in understanding the book. We received the item very quickly. Thanks.
1,sent this back 'cause I had mistakenly ordered two,I'm upset because I never received a refund after sending this item back to Amazon.
2,"""Things Fall Apart"", is an ok book, it is very elaberant","I recommend this book for Sophmores in High School, I read it in the 7th grade"
3,Lines too short,"It works properly, except that the included lines really need to be longer if you want to mount the filter in a convenient place. I am using it with an oil cooler, and was able to use only one line, from the filter mount to the cooler. I couldn't find a place to mount the filter block close enough to the engine filter boss to use the other hose."
4,Good quality,These are the best there is for saxophones. They are very good quality at a great price. Would definitely buy again.
5,"Great sound, easy to play, durable",We had been using another brand of reeds but the saxophone instructor told us about these. These are much easier to get a great sound from. And they last a long time too (with proper care).I would highly recommend--top notch brand!
4,Classroom Mobility,"I use this in a private high school classroom with a SmartBoard. The wireless keyboard and gyro-mouse free me up to move around during PowerPoint presentations. I like being able to take the keyboard and mouse and give them to a student to use. The students think the mouse is cool and enjoy helping out by having the mouse and keyboard at their desk. For fun, a teacher can give one student the mouse and the other the keyboard to see how well they can work together. As with any wireless product, it is sometimes not as reliable/accurate as I would like but overall I have found it to be acceptable for classroom use."
5,Simply a great book,"Parallax is written by a real scientist (not a 'science writer'). It relates the long history of the attempt to establish ones longitude at sea in simple (there's not a formula in the book) and exciting prose but with a depth of understanding only a professional astronomer could bring to the story. Alan Hirshfeld has joined the ranks of the great popularisers of science such as George Gamow, Stephen Hawkings and Jered Diamond. Were I still teaching Parallax would be required reading in my introductory astonomy courses."
5,Get Anything You Want Beyonce- I'm Yours,"If this aint a hot chick (woman). Attitude, piping vocals, dance moves that will are unmatched, beauty and BODY= Queen B-eyonce. She is the Diva for the ages and will definately go down in history. Life hammer said you can't touch this. The girl has got it and no one can deny and even if they do it doesn't matter because she is the B-BBBBBBBBBBBBBBZZZZZZZZZZ. Workit Beyonce."
5,Beyonce *** Get Me Bodied,"Great CD, a two song CD with just the two songs, but it leaves you wanting more. Oh yea, the price was great, too."
4,everybody wants this goddess,"admit it girls you like beyonce you all wanna sleep with her who would'nt she has the moves, reminds me of ishtar, isis, and aphrodite bye ladies go head and EXPLORE YOUR LESBIAN FANTASIES."
3,Futurama,"I love Bender. I wish they had more Bender toys, like the ones you can hang from the Rear View mirror."
4,Good Value ! !,"Happy customer here !!Personally think the longevity of a product of this type is too important for me to be able to give these support socks a FIVE STAR rating YET. I bought three pairs of ""Activa 20-30 mmHg Unisex Knee High Athletic Support Socks"" about a month ago. I have put them through the wash-dry-wear cycle three times so far and no loose threads, stretching, or shrinking. More importantly the socks help to prevent swelling in my ankles and calves even when on my feet all day."
5,Look like like normal socks,This pair looks like normal pair of socks but very comfertabel to wear.With 20 30 mmHg they get the job done while looking super kool.
2,"These wont knock your socks off, or whatever...",I ordered these really thinking I was on to something buying only the moderate compression as opposed to say medium compression socks which are just too restrictive and intense for what I put my socks through. Unwrapping the package and slipping into these babies was not the warm apple pie feeling I had envisioned. They are just normal tube socks with a fancy name. 20-30 mm? Yeah Right. More like 18-25. Try again Activa.
5,Really like these!,"I am really satisfied with these socks. I am a new nurse and after a 12 hour shift I would just feel so dead in my legs. My mom wears compression socks for venous insufficiency and she always talks about much they help her, so I thought what the heck I will give it a shot. I'm so happy I did! They are a bit of a pain to get on, and they'll never score points in the pretty department, but my legs feel so great at the end of a day."
5,Great support,Bought these for my wife. Nurse on her feet most of the day. She was very impressed stating they made her feet feel great. Highly recommended.
2,so so socks,"these socks are not medium support. although they look like athletic socks, possibly due to cotton content, the compression is not there. you are better off buying a socks with high nylon or spandex and then just putting a regular pair of socks over them. this works great too, for airport travel , when you need to take off your shoes at security. put compression socks on first then your regular socks so when you get to security you can take off your shoes, walk on the bacteria filled carpet there and then remove your outer socks and get back into your shoes with your clean nylon socks. excellent for infection prone folks who need to protect their feet."
2,Ran small,good construction but ran small and didnt do well after a was even though I followed instructions. Might be taking a chance here.
4,Worthwhile,"Only get if you need to be warm too, these stocking work well, they are just very warm. The size was as expected"
1,Nice Sock,they are nice. I really like them. They get dirty though so make sure you wear them with slippers or foot covers. They don't clean back as white as you might like them.
1,"not what i wanted.... want the old , classic movie named all the fine young cannibals",wasnt what i wanted...i wanted the classic movie...all the fine yong cannibals... would love to know if you could help me find the movie
4,Legendary Surf Movie On A Really Poor Quality DVD,"This is a fantastic surf movie, legendary really. The music is great, the surfing is great, the psychedelic effects are great (if you are into that sort of thing). But the big big bummer is that the DVD pressing is really bad quality. The one I got had little nibs of plastic on the playing surface, so the DVD would not play the entire way through. At this price (or any, right?) I expect a disc that plays. As far as I can tell, the director owns the film and is selling the DVD (on his site for $45!). Too bad he's skimping on the pressing because this is a great artifact of psychedelic hippy surfing culture."
2,Bad copy of a legendary film!,"Recently purchased a copy from ""surfvideo.com"", and was so disappointed!!! The terrible print saw my memories of this classic lost in jumpy, out of focus, GRAINY crap! It looks like someone used a handheld vidcam to record the movie playing on a poor television set..."
2,Gray Morning,"Falzon exposed Uluwatu to the world on Morning of the Earth. Good soundtrack but a ""vegeterian"" film. Like the vegeterian diet, monotonous."
5,Wonderful book series,"""Balloon Magic"" is a book series by author, Marvin L. Hardy. Be aware that the books within the series are for different size balloons. Ask the sellers which book they have before you buy it! More information about the books can be found at http://www.balloonmagic.com/ My review covers the basic 260Q book with spiral binding.Great photographs and precise instructions will have you creating a variety of kid favorites: basic dogs, daschunds, giraffes, swans, swords, teddy bears, etc. My only wish is that this book covered hats, too.The spiral binding was a wonderful aid that other books don't have. Search for a book that has spiral binding or you'll find yourself trying to keep the book open to the correct page while using both of your hands to create the wonderful balloon shapes!"
3,Great Instrumental Prog,"Great Instrumental Progressive Rock, only there's a problem. This isn't an instrumental CD. I would recommend this disc to every Prog head out there based on the music alone. The over emotive Freddie Mercury vocal treatment gets annoying. This would have been much better if Roine Stolt handle the vocal chores. The music is very good, moving, melodic and enough twists and turns to make for active listening. Aleena's vocals are strong and don't get in the way like Freddie Jr."
4,Impressive musical adventure,"It takes only few minutes while listening to this album to know that this is played by great musicians, I mean they are all impressives. The music is more experimental (though it was not possible) than the Flower Kings.Some great passages, some, yes there are a few, that aggressed me a bit.It is certainly an album to discover, the musicians are so talented, you might start doin' some comparaison with some supposed great prog musicians from the 70's and you might come to a conclusion that. after all, they were ordinary compared to those you can hear on this album. Recommanded to anyone who's not afraid to discover new prog music !"
4,One of the best of 2003.,"If you liked last year's ""Notes from the Past,"" you'll definitely like this. Stolt's guitar is prevalent much more than the NFTP. One downside is there are no instrumental tracks, but the lyrics are greatly improved from their last effort, mainly due to Stolt's contributions. This album expands on the sound of NFTP, with Lundin's trademark distorted keyboards, but this album has a harder edge, and maintains the prgressive aspect. So, aside from a mediocre singing and lyrics, this is a great album."
3,MURDER ME MY SWEET,"This made for TV movie isn't anything special, but it's entertaining enough. Lovely Barbara Niven and her retired lawyer dad Daniel J. Travanti move into a lovely new home in a small college town. A neighbor informs Niven that a man was murdered, allegedly by his wife, in their house which enrages Niven but piques dad's interest. Meanwhile Niven meets her hunky neighbor, Gary Hudson, who insinuates himself into her life. It's not hard to see where the movie is going, with Hudson not all what he seems; he even talks to dead wife Lisa Zane who was having an affair with the murder victim and whom he also killed and faked her suicide.Niven is appropriately vulnerable; Hudson nicely nasty and Travanti warm and cuddly. Not a mastrpiece, but enjoyable."
4,Enlightening,"I feel I've gotten more help from Dr. Teitelbaum's book than from the doctor's I've seen. Their staff is also very helpful if you call or e-mail a question. It's my opinion that Dr. Teitelbaum may be an even better psychologist that he is a doctor. The only drawback that I see is that Dr. Teitelbaum's solutions seem to be quite expensive. The average person with a family using Dr. Teitelbaum's protocol would have to work pretty long hours to pay for the treatments and of course, the average reader doesn't have the capacity to do that or they wouldn't be drawn to the book in the first place. Overall, I think it is a very good book and I do use some of Dr. Teitelbaum's products."
5,Just excellent - very accessible,I work as a primary care doctor and psychiatrist and I see a lot of ME & similar syndromes. I do use more alternative medicine than he suggests but the overview is really excellent - I just keep buying more to give away it is that good.
1,There is nothing scientific about his study,"The supposed scientific techniques are merely questionnaires that his patients to fill out, you won't be seeing them in any reputable medical journal. It also bother me that Dr. Teitelbaum charges $5,000 for a personal consultation. I feel he takes advantage of sick people. Towards the end of the book, he writes these essays on how CFS is a call for us all to slow down the pace of our lives. He speaks like a guru, a messiah leading us down the path of the mind body connection. If you love this man's work, go ahead and drop everything, sell your apartment, move to the country and start an organic farm. Sorry, that sort of thing is just not in my life plan."
5,The first book to give me hope!,A thorough and easy to understand treatment of fibromayalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. With this protocol PEOPLE GET BETTER!
1,Beware,"Book replete with generalizations. Lists volumns of vitamins and supplements which we can try by the hunt and peck method. But, he'd be glad to help guide us by diagnostically evaluating the online questionnaire (for a fee) and reading the submitted lab work. The lab work is quite extensive, expensive and may or may not be covered by ins. or accepted by the hospital or lab. Beware this is where the nightmare begins!"
1,Very disappointing,"Like the cartoons in the book, Dr. Teitlebaum seems to take this devastating disease as something to be seen with humor. Indeed, humor is essential for surviving CFIDS, but only on the victims terms, not Dr. Teitlebaums. In addition, his suggestions for therapy are out of reach to most of us who have been economically ravaged by this illness. A large part of his recommended therapies require precription drugs that are controversial. Many of us find it hard enough to find M.D.s that accept CFIDS, let alone provide injections of hormones, etc.Fatigued to fantastic? Yeah, right. Maybe some day fatigued to functional-that's all many of us realistically pray for. I felt like I had just walked out of another condescending doctors office, going home feeling small and misunderstood."
5,I found the book very informative in all areas of CFS/FMS,I have read Fatigue to Fantastic and have found it vey informative and have already started myself on some of the advice in the book. It explains CFS just as it is. Jacob Teitelbaum MD. tells it just like it is. Having suffered with himself makes you feel even more secure in reading his articles and following his advice.
1,What a Crowd,"Please don't be fooled into thinking this represents anything that is close to an actual trial of LOH. In the real world, this line of propaganda represents the most basic cover story in the JFK case, of which there are many. If you are objectively looking to enlighten yourself as to what actually happened, don't be satisfied or even persuaded by this. There will always be Oswald did it hyenas, but unfortunately for them, we are past the time when they can be taken seriously. As the HSCA concluded, there is a 95% probability of a conspiracy, but after the ARRB, we can now say 100% there was a conspiracy to kill JFK and a much longer conspiracy to cover it up amongst the important layers of society.Don't be fooled..."
4,More real than you think,"Here are the real witnesses and the real lawyers in this fictional trial of Lee Harvey Oswald. Filmed in Great Britain in the 1980s, few Americans have seen it. If you're at all interested in the Kennedy Assassination, this is a must have. (Further, if you watch the version of the Zapruder film used in this presentation you may notice something quite remarkable.)"
5,Murder Made Easy...If You Have The Right Tutors,"Most of the reviews describe ""Deadly Advice"" as a dark comedy. That is partly true but it's also equally a psychodrama in the best Hitchcockian tradition. The film concerns a fragile bookstore clerk(Jane Horrocks) desperate to become unencumbered by a sadistic mother(Brenda Fricker) who is goaded to murder by the presence of some of Britain's most notorious murderers most notably Jack the Ripper. The film is intricately scripted and offers interesting insights into what a killer should look like or our perception of what one is. One of the reasons some would view this as a comedy is the presence of Horrocks, one of Britain's premier light comedians. Seriously, would you consider Bubble from ""AbFab"" capable of murder? Regardless, casting Horrocks is brilliant and she rises to the occassion."
1,Rubbish!,"Yet another extremely mediocre attempt at film making. Both Imelda Staunton and Jane Horricks should have run for the hills when they were presented this appalling, unbelievable script. A very predictable waste of time. If you want to see Jane Horricks do something impressive buy ""Little Voice"""
3,Good boots,"I love anything Clarks - guaranteed to be comfortable. And these are, just as comfortable out of the box as they are today. My only complaint is one of the heels on my boots squeaks with every step I take - I don't want to be known around the office as ""squeaky"" . . ."
4,You can't go wrong!,I have been a Bosom Buddies fan since the show came out. Why it still doesn't air is beyond me. This and all the other video's are must haves. When ever I need a smile - these are the tapes that do it!
3,"Still pretty good, though a little bit disappointed","If you have never learned Flash before, you should definitely check out this book. Its contents are very clear and extrememly easy to follow and it is perfect for any beginner. However, this book will not teach you how to do any of those 'cool' stuff that one usually sees on the web. Flash is a very powerful program and this book literally addresses only the pinnacle of the iceberg. I really love the way instructions are laid out in the book, but i just feel that if the authors could use more real life complexed projects as their examples, it would really help someone to learn how to laid out a project and how to put all those great tools together to churn out a cool final product."
2,Beginner's book,"I bought this book hoping to broaden my foundation with Flash 5, and found the concepts covered to be very general and basic. There are lots of nice looking graphics to illustrate the concepts presented, but the focus seems to be more on the visual presentation rather than the dissemination of applicible information. If you are a beginner to flash, this book will probably help enormously, as it will give you visual cues and screen shots to associate with the flash work environment. If you understand the basics of Flash, this book will provide you with nothing more than some pictures to look at, telling you what you already know."
1,Sure she's beautiful....if you like how a bird looks,"I have no problem with this lady but for someone to label her the ""most beautiful woman in the world"" is downright ridiculous. Even she should say, that's stupid, don't give me that title. She is only attractive with some green/blue eyes. Maybe bcz her people have never seen their type with those colored eyes, that they are amazed at her looks. We can never say that person is the most beautiful, bcz you haven't seen everyone and everyone has different tastes. My opinion is Angelina is much more beautiful. Inside too, with her caring for the world. This lady looks like a bird. I thought 60 mins were more intelligent than this."
2,Egh...,"I really wanted to like this movie. I felt like this movie was trying to make a bold statement, sort of in the vein of American Beauty, but had no grounds for making this statement. It was pretty boring at times. This is not one of those ""gems"" we all hope to discover. This movie seems like it was intended for a major release in the USA, but none of the film companies felt like it was a good movie.It's not a awful movie, but it does NOT reach the heights that it thinks it's reaching."
5,"charming, unique, funny","I love this movie.The characters were real even though they were unusual. I cared about them, I loved them. They were well developed even though they were representitive arch types.When the movie was over, I wished it weren't. To me it is a quirky work of genius, maybe even more so because of it's wonderful, gentle, directing, the perfect acting."
4,Top Shelf Stuff,This is an excellent hip-hop album that covers a wide range of styles with an array of heavy beats and thought-provoking lyrics. An intriguing album from beginning to end.
4,What more would you expect from the dungeon crew?,Goodie Mob lays it down on their second release. when you listen to hip hop as much as I do you really start to weed out the sounds that are original and new. It definately meets my standards for one of the revolutionary hip hop albums that will carry Hip Hop into the 21st century. this album has definately earned a place in my case logics. It's dope and I hope that you decide to pick it up. You can also hear goodie mob a lot on OUTKAST'S southerplayalisticadilacfunkymuzic and some on AT aliens
4,more of the same,"The album is a darker, more soulful version of soul food. Very spirritual and lyrically heavy. if you are a fan of the south, live instuments and lyricism this is the album"
4,Goodie Mob's Still Standing,"Though not as good as Soul Food, Goodie Mob's Still Standing is a great follow up album. My favorite songs are They Don't Don't Dance No Mo, Black Ice, and Still Standing. This is a great album to have if you already own Soul Food."
5,FOREVER STANDING!,"FOR ALL YA'LL THAT DON'T KNOW THE SOUTH IS ON A RAISE SO NORTH EAST AND WEST YOU BETTER SIT UP AND PAY ATTENTION CUZ SCHOOL IS IN ITS ALL ABOUT THE FILTHY NASTY DIRTY ROTTEN SOUTH WHERE EVERYBODY GOT GOLD IN THEY MOUTH YOU WELCOME TO COME YOU WELCOME STAY BUT IF YOU DISRESPECT WE WILL MAKE YO AZZ FLY AWAY MAN WIT LYRICS LIKE THAT GOODIE MOB IS REPRESENTING TO THE FULLEST PLUS TRACKS LIKE BEAUTIFUL BLACK SKIN, I REFUSE LIMITATIONS, DON'T DANCE NO MO, STILL STANDING AND FLY AWAY THIS WHOLE ALBUM IS ALL GRAVY AS WE SAY IN THE SOUTH."
5,I cannot wait to read this book,"This will be my 20+ book. lecture, DVD, CD and movie by Dr. Wayne W. Dyer. When I finish ""Power Of Intention"" and rereading it, I will move on to this one. I can tell it is going to be enlightening, positive and amazing. Anyone beg to differ? : )"
2,Spoon - Teapot design,"Photo on website 1,000 better than the real thing. Although this product looked better than the others I purchased they are still cheap plastic rubbish. I seen better. Not worth the money. Am extremely disappointed with the product, the seller, the seller and the delivery time. I will not be shopping with this supplier again."
5,"Dark Shadows - The Beginning, Vol. 6","I have practically the entire collection now and particularly wanted these early volumes. Mostly, I wanted No. 6 because it's when Jason and Willie come on the scene. I love the two actors: Dennis Patrick and John Karlen. Actually the entire cast is terrific and no matter if they remake this again for the big screen, it'll never be better than the originals. NO ONE can match Karlen's nervous, hyper-sensitivity. He's the best! This collection is well worth the $ which I think is a fair price. On an earlier review I forgot to mention that Karlen doesn't come in until Disk 4. THere is a far less effective (and far less handsome) actor playing Willie in the beginning. I am SO glad that Karlen took his place. What an improvement in how the characterization was handled and as I said, Karlen is quite handsome. Anyway, even if he doesn't show up till Disk 4, I'm glad I bought it. When he does enter the cast, he's absolutely terrific!"
4,Not a bad Deal,"The sound quality is very good, disc changing very easy, but adding radio stations are not easy and neither is adding songs to the MP-3 player."
4,"The not so secret love of sons, from generation to generatio","In a Latin American culture, the relationship between mother/son is quite different from that of mother/daughter. I had grown to believe that the characteristics of the former depended largely from our cultural background. However, after reading the book I have come to realise that there are many similarities in what the author points out with what we face in Latin America. AS the mother of 5 children (2 boys, 3 girls) and grandmother of 5 (one girl, 4 boys), I have passed this book on to my daughter and my daughter in law for their delight and enlightment."
5,A Wonderful Adventure Story for Children,"A wonderfully exciting and educational book taking the reader to Egypt. Lots of adventure to please both boys and girls mixed in with helping children learn to cope with loss. It's an attention holding book for adults as well. Great writing! A book for every child's library shelf.Evelyn Horan - teacher/counselor/authorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl Books One - Three"
1,Xuxa,"Not what I expected. Not enough information about the video on the review. I found this video under Spanish videos, expecting a video in Spanish, and it turned out to be in English with a heavy accent."
5,Excellent! I Love this Book.,As a Food Scientist I know the ins and outs of recipe formulation and ingredient functionality. Apparently so does this author.These recipes are delicious and well explained. I have great confidence recommending this book to the weekend baker. Great recipes for those events such as pot lucks and book club meetings. Many twists on familiar favorites.Great photography too!
5,The All-American Cookie Book,Fell in love with this authors books. I like her comments about the recipes. I have three of her books so far.
3,Too bad,"I too had high hopes for this cookbook but was disappointed. I am an experienced baker and tried the iced lemon short bread and pecan brickle..They tasted good, but were not worth the work. I also ran into some problems with the recipe, was able to make the correct adjustment in baking time, but that is because I am experienced. Probably depends on which recipe one chooses to try."
3,Not my favorite,"Even though this book holds many, many cookie recipes, it is by far not my favorite of the many I own.I have tried several of the recipes, and they are almost *all* too sweet for my likes. In comparison to similar cookie recipes in other books, they have 1.5 to 2 times as much sugar, which is just too much for my likes.I would have liked to see more pictures of the listed recipes, because I find that inspiring, and last (but not least) i don't care for the author's tone at all. She seems to present herself as the one and only cookie expert, who has come to the 'best' recipes after 'professionally testing' the many recipes available, and I didn't appreciate that much, nor found it inspiring."
3,Not bad but not terrific either,"I agree with two of the other reviewers who state that the author's tone is pretty high and mighty. It feels as if she assumes you are a mere kindergartener who has no clue what she's doing.The recipe selection is nice and the pictures that are included (I would have liked to see more) are tantalizing. The actual recipes themselves are at times a bit confusing or not exact enough.That being said, the Joe Froggers recipe turned out very nicely. I also baked the Black & Whites, though reviews haven't come in yet from those I baked them for. I look forward to trying additional recipes from the book, but will do so with a pinch of caution."
5,EXCELLENT COOKIES!,"I received this book two years ago for Christmas from my brother. I actually TRAVEL with this cookbook! Every single recipe I've tried is delicious. The snickerdoodle recipe is the best I've ever had and I get rave reviews each time I make them. From a person who bakes all the time, this book ranks very high on my list. GREAT GIFT!"
3,"Nice book, but disappointing recipes","I'm an experienced baker and pastry maker and really like the historic information in this book - I never really thought about how hard it must have been to bake cookies in former times. But the recipes (at least the ones I tried - Molasses Applesaucers and Old Fashioned Oatmeal Raisin Cookies) were disappointing: even using Ms. Baggett's measuring method, the amount of flour in the recipes was far too low and the resulting cookies were WAY TOO SWEET. The instructions are very repetitive. I'm glad I got the book at the library so I can return it."
5,One of my all time favorite books,"This book is a great way for people to learn how to do simple math problems (arithmetic operations) in their heads. Unlike some other books in the same genre that simply give you gimmicks without explaining how or why they work, W. J. Howard offers tricks that have a solid basis in mathematical logic and explains the rationale. Another problem that many other mental math books have is that they require you to memorize a lot of rules that aren't easily relatable to common sense. Dr. Howard's book, however, only gives you a few rules which are easier to remember because they have a logical basis.Even if you aren't interested in mental math, this book is a great refresher for those who have forgotten how to do arithmetic without a calculator. So toss out your calculators, sharpen your pencils, and buy this book. You won't regret it."
4,Great short book,I like this book. I leave it by the toilet and read sections while sitting there. I learned a lot of shortcuts and find it simple and very practical. Highly recommend!!!
3,Content Is Edited,"Others have done a good job detailing what's on here, but for those wondering, some of the original entrance music and Jesse Ventura's commentary are not included. So, during The Hollywood Blondes vs Ric Flair & Arn Anderson, and Brian Pillman vs. Steve Austin, expect to have a disjointed commentary, since only Tony Schiavone's part of the commentary is included. All in all, not a bad collection of matches, but the edits are annoying."
4,Solid effort,"I would have liked to have seen more about the behind the scenes info for each Clash, any controversies, more of how it came to be, etc. Dusty gave a quick snippet, but that wasn't enough. That said, the matches were fantastic. Just a reminder at how many different styles you saw back in the 80s and 90s as opposed to the cookie cutter WWE matches and wrestlers of today."
3,Good disc for WCW fans,"Some of the matches on here are hit or miss. You maybe better off going on youtube and finding some of the better COC matches. With that said, the good matches are really good. I am a bigger fan of the 1-2 hour long Documentary style dvd , but this is a decent set."
5,the best of wcw clash of champions,I LOVE THIS DVD SET . THE COLOR AND ARTWORK IS GREAT . I LOVE THE WCW WRESTLERS ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS IS A GREAT DVD SET.
5,Clash was the best,"The preview video is more entertaining then anything seen today. The clash was so cool, free ppv and never a flop. I really, REALLY, miss this era in wrestling."
2,Less than hoped for,"I get an itch for motorsports in the off-season. After watching these four movies, I am still itching. I thought these movies would cover IRL, not just Indianapolis. 24-Hours at Indy killed my desire to ever visit Indianapolis."
3,Wendell Baker,"I bought this not expecting too much from it. The Wilson brothers don't disappoint comedically, however at times it seems it would have made more sense for Luke and Owen to switch roles. Will Ferrell does make a few hilarious appearances, and overall the movie isn't bad, just not one of their best."
3,Original Dr. Scholl's Women's Impulse Thong Sandal,"Looks great, however not comfortable to walk in all day long. The strap across the top rubs in a painful manner across the top of my foot. I am hoping that this will go away after breaking in period."
5,Steve Jones ROCKS!,"I owned this album in 1990, and since then it always comes back to mind, almost 20 years later! It's Timeless!"
2,"Its like Dream Theater, but Less Good","Theres a funny story that goes with this. My friend said he downloaded Octavarium and it sucked. Since Octavarium is great I went to find out what had happened. Turns out he downloaded this album. The guitar player does a good Petrucci, but hes not Petrucci. The keyboard is cheesey and doesn't come close to Jordan Rudess. And overall the songs are a lot less progressive than DT and don't have the virtuosity element. There are some good guitar solos but thats about everything technical. I'd give it a 2.5. LaBrie does a great job on this albums vocals so if your a fan of his singing by all means buy it. If your looking for more Dream Theater, stay away."
3,Too Much Thought Influenced,"Okay, I listened a couple of times to this one, and, like one other reviewer noted: I like James' Mullmuzzler better. This is just another extension of Train of Thought with that angry type of music. When I listen to music I want to be entertained, not bashed about, not cursed at either. Have a little imagination here. The guitar playing is just more speed instead of creativity. For me, like Train of Thought, this doesn't cut it. I've listened and that's about it for me and this release. Too much anger. Please get over it. Hopefully DT's new release is totally different than this or their last one. I'll listen first before I buy because I'm tired of getting burned."
2,He's lost! Show him the way!,"This is by far the worst thing James LaBrie released in his career, and it hurts me more to know that this is his solo debut. Only some sort of medium songs saves the thing, but the rest is pure garbage. I recommend to you that, instead of this bad album, get something like Mullmuzzler, by far the best James has released as a side project, or even Ayreon - The Human Equation."
1,Old Schoolers: Proceed with caution on this one.,"Well, I guess I'll have to be the party pooper here. As much as I wanted to like this disc, I just can't. Sounds like James Labrie is singing for Incubus or Disturbed. I don't care for the techno samples and record scratches and all of the nu-metal hints that are here. I suppose I compare everything these guys are involved with to Images and Words and Falling Into Infinity. If you ever wondered what Dream Theater would sound like if they were influenced by Linkin Park, here is your opportunity. Sorry folks, but that's just the honest truth."
4,James LaBrie should stay solo...,Well I was very surprised to hear LaBrie sounding more like what he probably would like to sound like. I'd give anything for him to stick to his solo work and let Dream Theater go instrumental or maybe snatch Geoff Tate for their vocals. LaBrie sounds very commercial on this CD and it seems to work for him.Sure is better than his forced vocals on the DT Master of Puppets Bootleg.- john coyle
3,Eating right for a bad gut,"Very interesting, but a little redundant, I plan on trying some of his thought provoking ideas, has been difficult living w/ Crohn's"
5,Look no further this is the answer to your gut problem!,"Just click on Buy Now. AS a life long IBD patient I was doing really well until this past winter when a major setback hit me. As those who suffer from IBD know, sometimes desparation sets in and one looks for new advice. This is the BEST collection of advice I have ever read! The advice here is right on and it pointed out some mistakes I had made with my diet. I followed the diet and increased my vitamin and mineral regimen per his directions. Follow this advice, try one new thing at a time, even the author tells you one must do what is best for your individual gut. I bought one of these books for each of my adult sons who suffer with IBS too! AN EXCELLENT ADDITION TO MY REFERENCE LIBRARY, Buy it, follow it and be well.!"
1,Author not a sufferer=No Clue,"The Author of this book has never suffered from IBD and does not have a clue what diet to follow. His diet guidelines are not based on ANY research or anything of any significance. This was the first book I read when I was diagnosed, and it is awful. Waste of time, and waste of money. See instead Jill Sklar's - Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis book."
1,Wasted paper,This book is horrificly inaccurate. The author clearly never watched the later seasons of Buffy because if he did he would know that Buffy was in love with Spike. He contridicts just about everything Joss Whendon had said about the Buffy/Spike relationship. I agree that if you are a Spike and/or a Spuffy fan then do not buy this book.
1,Sloppy fact-checking,"The fact-checking department did a sloppy job. In First Date, Buffy admitted to Willow that she was IN love WITH Spike. Series creator Joss Whedon confirms during his Chosen commentary that Buffy did love Spike. This book contradicts the evidence by stating several times that Buffy did not love Spike.Including a picture of the Buffy/Angel tongueless kiss is a dubious choice over Buffy/Spike's flaming hands, rather akin to choosing a pic of Buffy trying to kiss Riley in As You Were over the Becoming kiss. Judging from his commentary, Whedon considers Buffy/Spike's flaming hands to be the key moment but it is ignored in this book.In general, the author does not seem aware of Whedon's take on the finale, including Whedon saying that Buffy/Angel left their relationship at the graveyard."
2,Author Reaches Too High,"This is the third book done by Paul Ruditis. Isn't nearly as engaging as the first two. The book does, in fact, cover season seven, despite what some reviwers have been saying. But it's just not that much fun to look at and some of the information is wrong. I would have much prefered it ifHolder and Golden had collaborated again to write the third book."
2,Surprisingly the Worst of the Series,"Simply put, the first two ""Watcher's Guide"" were fun and in-depth, this third one--not so much. The first Guides seem to add a lot of additional information even for the devoted BtVS fan. The third guide read like newspaper clippings and/or national magazine glib articles written by some one who wrote about the phenomena and not the creative essence of ""Buffy"" the show. And I loved Tara and her relationship with Willow, but for some reason, nothing new or substantial about their bond is added into the third guide. REALLY DISAPPOINTING. Why was this one so lack luster?"
3,different from the first two,"While I missed the behind the sceens stuff from the first two Watchers' Guides (even the second one, which had maybe too much!), it was interesting to see the essays from a varity of writers in the back talking about different aspects of the show. And I like the consistent formula for the episode guides. Not the best of the three, but it's nice to have a complete set."
2,"Nice to own, most disappointing volume.","After the first two Watcher's Guides were must-own volumes, I assumed that the author(s) and the publishers were looking to finish their BtVS guides with a bang.Not really the case.At best this book limps along, the main author's clear bias to certain relationships incredibly evident.It lacks the things that made the first two volumes great -- the special features, if you will. There's no character guides, no quote sections, no extensive interviews with the cast and crew. Yes, it has critical(?) essays. But most of the time the writers come off as either self-important or childish.Yes, I own this volume, but were the first volume this disappointing I wouldn't have purchased subsequent books."
1,Very Poor,"I strongly recommend that you buy Keith Topping's unofficial guide instead of this. ""Slayer: The Last Days of Sunnydale"" is much more accurate because Mr. Topping bases his opinions on interviews from Joss Whedon and other writers of the show.""The Watcher's Guide"" is just the opinion of the author and is completely inconsistent with what Joss Whedon has stated in multiple interviews.The sloppiness of this book is shocking."
2,Where was the Slayer when this book was made?,"I had looked forward to the third installment of the series Watcher's Guides for quite sometime and when it came out I ordered it right away...BIG MISTAKE!Quite on the contrary to the first 2 Watcher's Guide Volumes, this book has NO CHARACTER GUIDE or Bio Guide, my 2 favorite parts! The ""Restless"" episode teleplay is interesting but, i would have given that up in a second for the character giude.The Episode Guide is done well but I expect a well done episode guide, that's why i'm buying this book. I could easily live without the essays wich are basically there to take up room, and speaking of room, the Watcher's Guide Volume 2 (containing two seasons) is thicker than The Watcher's Guide Volume 3 (containing THREE SEASONS! ~what's up with that?)A big let-down for all Buffy Fans and the end of the series. I just hope that the new Angel Casefiles will be better, which is sadly also going to be done by Paul Ruditis who I am ashamed of."
5,"The Promised Land- the great migration, Mississippi to Chicago","Please put the documentary on DVD, no one want to look at VHS any more and the quality of DVD is much better, and why can't more older documentaries be on DVD. if it was crap it would have been on DVD.Seems no more Black History documentaries don't show anymore and I love seeing those and if it was'nt for Ted Turner and PBS, and the Discovery Channel a lot of Blacks and even Whites would'nt know this informative information"
5,DVD Please,I remember waiting for February to come so I could watch this. They only showed it during Black History Month. Our PBS channel was the only station that showed it. Lucky for me I taped it before they stopped showing it. 2 years ago I saw the VHS on Amazon and bought it. I have continued to wait for it to come on DVDIt is an amazing depiction of the Great Migration and is just as relevant today as it was then. It is a shame that this great work of truth has been overlooked.To the power's that be please release this great work of art on DVD.
4,Havana Heat: A Lupe Solano Mystery,The book was in good condition. I purchased it for my daughter. The book arrived at the time it was suppose to.
1,Got Ripped Off,This was my first purchase on Amazon and they ripped me off by making me pay $65 taxes and shipping. I filed a complaint and they said thats the way it is.Never shop from Amazon!!!! I would buy some thing for few extra dollars than getting that kind of surprises.Amazon sucks big time. I would never ever never ever.......buy from this store as I dont want to pay twice the price just because they have some stupid system!! BEWARE>>> NEVER BUY FROM AMAZON
4,Shipped Quick,"I wasn't expecting to get my book until the latest shipping date, but I was pleasantly surprised when it showed up on my doorstep on the first date shown. Perfect condition, no problems at all."
4,"Not funk, but still pretty good...","Allstars is good for chillin out and relaxin'. Fresh take on old style without being wack. Best effort by band. Later works just don't hold up to the vibe on this platter. Groove oriented for sure, but if you're looking for real funk...keep on looking. Don't let that deter you from picking this up though, it's still fresh as hell. Browns at home and Gravee deliver the goods that will satisfy your head. Peace.Diante"
3,Good but not great,"I liked the tracks fine, but I have heard better. this was a first time purchase for me. I think that I was pleased enough to explore their other albums."
4,A gem.,We loved Henry's cat - it's great when adults can get as much out of watching something their children watch (repeatedly). I've remembered it for 20 years and finally tracked down the DVD version.
1,Paw Tectors don't last,"We bought these new. Our dog has worn her ""Paw Tectors"" about 2 dozen times now and 2 of the 4 of them are cracking already. I strongly recommend not buying this brand unless you want to shell out $25 every few weeks.We complained to Paw Tectors and they sent us a new pair for free on 3/8/07. We will try them out and see if they fare better. But kudos to this company for standing by their product!!"
4,"Good movie, no English subtitles","Johnny Stecchino is an excellent comedy, similar to the U.S. movie ""The Man Who Knew Too Little"" with Bill Murray. A word of warning: This DVD does not have English subtitles, but Italian subtitles are available for the ""hard of hearing"" who speak Italian, or Italian-speaking people whose speakers broke. This review is for the DVD that is sold from Italy, with the description on front and back of the DVD case in Italian. I am unaware if the U.S. DVD's of this movie contain subtitles in English or not. The VHS tape does contain English subtitles."
1,Bad day,The disk itself didn't work. It was a big disappointment because this is my favorite movie and it ended up not working at all.
1,More Sharepoint than Excel... Disappointing.,"Very disappointing. I'd guess 70% deals with Sharepoint & MOSS, rather than Excel. The PM discussions are a mix of PMP/PMBOK and overly-simplistic management guidelines. Most EXCEL techniques & how-to can be found by easy web search."
2,Poor Service and follow-up ruins the gift giving experience...,"I bought this watch for my wife and paid a premium for quick service. The premium delivery (1-3 day) service was regular US Mail. I finally found the watch in my post office box. Emails to the vendor went unanswered as did the phone. The watch came in an elegant box to match its priice, but there was no direction booket or warranty. However, there was a ""scrap"" of paper that included some brief directions that appeared as though they had been photo copied. I would not choose this vendor again. After getting over the frustration of receiving the watch my wife now enjoys wearing it...but I will never purchase this type of product online from Amazon as I thought there would be higher level of service from a vendor at this price point."
5,Covers the essentials,"Dr. Elder's first book is a gem, and is suitable for traders at any level of experience. The reader learns the importance of having and adhering to firm trading rules. Successful money management is a required skill in order to become a successful trader, and Elder offers good advice on this topic.Elder's education (psychiatrist) gives him the perfect background to explain to the reader how to benefit from understanding crowd psychology.Covering such topics as risk management and how to use a trading system, he emphasizes technucal analysis and shares his own personal methods with the reader.You will refer to this book again and again over the years. This book may be 10 years old, but it is still very appropriate today."
5,Save a ton of money,Read the book before you begin trading. Professional education can easily run $300 per day so this book is well worth the price. It will save you thousands if you retain and apply the concepts. Working on reading his second book now.
3,"Some good points, but repetitive","This book is easy to read with focus on the mindset a trader must have to avoid being driven by emotions when making decisions. I find it helpful, however I think it could have been explained in half of the space used.The explanation of the tools is very complete and detailed."
2,Not exactly textbook material,"Dr. Elder begins the book with wonderful insights and practical methods for trading in our current volatile market. But once that fifth of the book is over, there isn't really that much left worth reading. A big chunk of the book deals with Technical Analysis (TA), and while TA hasn't been proven or disproven, Dr. Elder offers little in the way of true advice. His suggestions in this part of the book are about as useful as a winter jacket in Hawaii. For those who are truly interested in ""Trading for a Living"", there are many, many better and more insightful books out there. Then again, that's just my opinion."
1,bad reviews has been deleted by the author.,I'm giving this book * because you deleted most of the bad reviews. Do not delete bad reviews! Let them express their fair notes about your book.
2,Trading For A Living - Not!,"This book is more of a homage to Morningstar. A more appropriate title would be ""Morningstar's Guide to Picking Mutual Funds"" because the book definitely does not talk about trading for a living. While the book does offer some good tips on selecting mutual funds, tax tips, and the typical traits of stock market psychology, it fails to live up to it's title and stated objectives. One would be better off subscribing to Morningstar directly. At least they would have the most up to date information."
3,Trading for a Living,"Great insight and information about trading and stock market. This used book was overpriced and not accurately described (was listed as in ""good condition with some underlining"" but was worn, has older copyright, and underlined heavily on most pages)."
1,Read Market Wizards!!!,"Market Wizards are the books you want to read. I read the 2 market wizard books 1st then read this book. The wizards books if full of the most fascinating, hard to EVER put down reading I have ever done. They have taught me so much. Then when I got to this book it was as if I was on my 1st day of trading and never knew about charts, fundamentals, P/E's and other basics and then some more advanced chart readings, asset allocation, when to place stops, protecting what you have not what isn't there. Read Market Wizards and then if you want more reading get this book. I found that it was overpriced 1st of all and the Wizards provided more valuable information.In Summation this book is good if:1) U buy it Used2) You have never invested before3) You don't know from charts to getting hurt by stock price movement4) Never read any other quality books about investing."
1,Forget this book.,"Garbage, don't be lead to believe that you too can predict the future by looking at some lines and charts. Waste of time and money."
5,"If You Read and Implement this book, You Will Make Money","I'm new to Trading, and have now read over a dozen books.This is by far the best book I've read on trading.Dr. Elder outlines early in the book the attributes of a looser, and by evaluating my own character, I could identify some of these attributes, and choose to change.Thanks to this book I am no longer a looser but a winner.If you only buy one book on trading, or never read any other book on trading, this is the one to read.If you read, and implement what Dr Elder reveals, (That does mean analyzing yourself honestly) Then You Will Make Money."
2,technically worthless,I am a professional trader. This book has a good section on psychology but thats it. Totally worthless when it comes to the technical part. In fact I always wondered what made this book so popular with the public. I guess most people read the books but don't use the knowledge in them.
5,This is a very useful book. ait contains lot of information that you don't want to miss,"This is a very good book. There is lots of bright ideas in it. You want to read it many times to take advantage of it completely. After you read this book. Read "" What I Learned Losing a Million Dollars""What I Learned Losing a Million Dollars. This is also a great book that you can't afford missing it. You will be able to get prepared for trading successfully after finish reading both books. Best luck trading to everyone."
4,Worthwhile Study,"A little hard to apply all the techniques in real life, but very useful ideas to be studied and inplemented. Gives a ""can do"" perspective to this mystifying field of endeavour."
5,Aspiring traders can't afford to be without this book!,"An excellent book on trading and technical analysis that cuts through all the hype surrounding this subject. Dr. Elder writes with clarity, humor and wit, puncturing common myths about trading and reviewing the mistakes many beginning (and even some experienced) traders make.The best parts of the book are the sections on individual psychology and money management. Beginning traders who follow Dr. Elder's recommendations on the use of stops and maximum trade size should survive their learning curve with credit and ego intact.Save yourself a lot of money and read this book BEFORE you make your mistakes!"
2,Merely okay,"I got rather little out of this book.... It does not go very deep. It is suprisingly weak on psychological matters, unless you buy into the 12-step-program formula. Worse, the technical analysis seems suspect and much of the material is now out of date (this is no timeless classic like Market Wizards) ... he is certainly an intelligent man -- and this book is far from the worst out there; but there are much, much better books available (see Tharp or Schwager for starters). I read it a year ago and have not had any reason to go back to it since."
4,"Excellent ""Bible"" on Trading Psychology","Elder's book is a great text on trading psychology and what makes the markets move, etc. This is not an instruction book on day trading but more of a book on the psychological motivation behind what makes the markets move."
4,Best for the shy trigger traders,The book is a great asset to a traders mind . It is a must for the begginers and also a good choice for the pros as they tend to be sometimes too brave in the markets.Thank you Dr Elder !
5,A trading book without sugarcoat,"I wish I'd read this book along with other book of Elder, 'Come into my trading room, when I first started out in trading business. This book thoroughly explains the cold harsh reality of the nuts and bolts of trading business. I highly recommend this book to anyone contemplating venturing into trading business."
2,SO SO,"THis is another compilation of technical analysis. Some pop psychology, the only part which can lead to profitable trades is the triple screen method. Use it with a pinch of salt. (DO not use Stochastic in a trending market (screen 2)) A good practical bok might be Jack Sch. Tech ana explaine"
3,trading for living,it is just good.psychiatric interpreation is o.k one or two good points in the whole book.
2,PUZZLING,"The author states ""that resistance is like a diver who reaches the ocean floor."".."".also the trader is the weakest link in the system , yet sole reponsibility for its decisions rest in the trader.'The book is full with such contradictions and psychological manipulations that only a very smart professional will be able to bypass all the hype and false info.Since Eastern Europenas are usually superiorly educated than its Western counterparts I was dissapointed with reading his contracdicting thoughts on the market."
5,"Licence for making money, by garantee",This book took me on board to the markets. Everywhere and everytime
3,Same old same ole,"Elder runs trading camps and has a real cult of personality so allot reviews are based on him and not necessarily this book. The book is really a re-hashing of simple trend trading and really shows it's age. If you must persist with Elder I'd get Come Into My Trading Room which has some interesting ideas, the stop loss worksheet etc. but really Elder is someone you probably won't get much out of unless you are a long term trader (> 13 weeks) or do options as too much of his stuff just doesn't make it for day trading or swing trading...for daytrading get the Bernstein books, he's got some good ideas but he's rather sloppy in execution still his systems are variations on some solid stuff.For swing trading, the old standby, with allot caveat, is Edwards & Magee. Elder really doesn't have enough in him to warrant more than glimpsing at hjs stuff."
2,Ok for beginners,Elders book is a good introduction to technical analysis and the setting up of a trading system for beginners.After reading the novice trader should depart from the book and start to explore on his/her own.Elder touts his own system (which via backtesting does not do well at all) and his view on investor psychology is basically Freudian - which is very crude and decontextualized.Read for fun - not enlightenment. Burn after reading.
5,Interesting point of view,"I found this book very interesting. Author is a psychologist and analyses the market crowd's behavior from a psychological point of view. I read only 65 pages yet, but already have many interesting advices to use in my trading."
2,A trading book that does not offer much,"I bought this book 7 years ago when it was one of the bestsellers in the trading book catergory and I am suprise to see today that its still one of the best sellers.Serious, I don't think I really get a lot out of this book and I don't understand why people are so crazy about it?? One reason I can think of, maybe it is a good book for absolute beginners who has no idea about trading what so ever.But if you want to learn more about trading, ie. the skill to use, the way to manage your money. You will be very disappointed. Throughout the years, I read a lot of trading books which offer way more than this one."
5,This Book has it all!,"After years of trading, I still go back and re-read this book.It has it all:- Trading Psychology- Money Management- Trading Systems- Technical AnalysisWell written and very easy to understand, this book is a must to have in your Stock Trading resource library!"
5,A great book for the starter!,"If you want to survive in this dog-eat-dog world of stock market, this is a must have book. It prepares you mentally in dealing with the adversities in the day to day trading operation. In addition, it reveals useful tactics to succeed in the business. This is a book to keep and constantly review the principles outline within."
4,Great trading wisdom,"This is an excellent primer on trading, including everything from the basics of identifying trends to managing risk and money to the psychology of why price moves as it does and how to avoid the pitfalls of the human mind. Though it was written prior to online trading, the same factors still apply today."
4,thank you for the book,"To Dr. Elder,I read your Trading for a Living 5th times now, I think, I did not really count. This time I focused more on the last section on money management.At the first few times when I read this, I read through it but deep down in my mind, I did not buy your idea of the 2 percent rule. It really just doesn't ""make sense"" for those of us who has a small account.I am glad after about half a year reading and re-reading your book, and I began to hear you speaking to me whenever I am ready to pick-up the phone and place an order. My equity account is still small, and grown just a little bit, but if you said 20% annually would be called a king of Wall Street, and I think I should be contented with that.I wish many others would have read your book and re-think or re-learn their trading habits.Many thanks again."
3,Some good ideas,Some good ideas here well explained as far as the book goes. Reminded me of playing cards all night with friends while studying at college. If I came to the game with less than ~100 pots in my pocket then would need to be careful to survive the night. I would not rate this to be among the best or most useful books on investment that I have ever read however I would not hesitate to recommend it to someone unfamiliar with the subject of trading risk management.
5,Book of Wisdom,"Very insightful, ispiring and well-written book. Even the psychology section is practical and to the point -- no fluff, no platitudes. My fears that I was buying more ""please lie down on the couch"" stuff proved to be totally wrong. The technical analysis and trading methods sections are extremely interesting. Not the first book I've ever read on the subject, but still a wealth of knowledge and insight."
4,"a solid book, after having traded a bit","This book is very solid, if you want to start thinking for yourself, or are looking to learn from past mistakes, and you want to trade (short horizons), not long-term invest (which is the ultimate goal), this book may prove helpful. It has many anecdotes, and he offers his opinions of the market.He states many facts, which when you read them, they cause you to stop and think. It's not an easy read, nor does he offer quick fixes, or a promise of more money. What he does offer though is knowledge, and explications that can work as tools. You have to take the jump and trade independently for yourself. It was good enough for me to write a review."
5,SINGERS S--I--N--G; CRITICS CRITICIZE,"Never listen to a critic; listen to your fellow music lovers. The first time I found ""Hymns"" I passed it by. Don't make that mistake. If you love Corey Glover, and I know you do, you'll love ""Hymns."" I know what you'll be saying after you hear it, so I'll say ""you're welcome"" now."
5,Do not believe Michael Ruby's Review,"This CD is great. In spite of the review given by Michael Ruby, this is a vocalist who shines in any capacity. It is not worse off because it has many flavorings, it is MUCH better off. There id definitely something to fit any mood that you might be in. Overall, there is not a bad song on the album."
2,GREAT IDEA POOR EXECUTION,This system finally worked after I took the casting to a machine shop to re tap the threads for the cooler lines. $40 later it worked as it should have from the factory. Other than the screw up on their part the unit works great.
2,not for bypass filter though,cheapest adapter on the net right here but will not work for a bypass filter without modification. Simply for a cooler.
2,Mariel has alot of free time on her hands.,"This book is geared for someone that has alot of free time to herself. Perhaps someone that is a stay at home wife or has retired and has all the time in the world to do Mariel's suggestions. If you are busy with a job because you have to work like most people, than this book is not for you."
4,"Mariel is an inspiring, encouraging presence","The book comes straight from Mariel's heart -- Good Orderly Direction for living a radiant life. Nothing unique or new, just a beautiful woman sharing her beautiful way of life. I keep this book on my desk at work, and glance through it from time to time when I need a break from the rat race. Grateful to Mariel for sharing her life with us."
5,She understands that I have to incorporate changes a few at a time,"This guide really makes it easy to start doing all the right things for your body, mind and spirit. I love it. The style of writing and the organization of the material made it very digestible and not overwhelming. I am making changes every day (as I sip my green tea sweetened with stevia herb). (And I found 30 minutes to meditate this morning before my busy work schedule.) It will be an ongoing resource book that I keep close at hand. I would have liked to see an accompanying CD with the yoga moves on it as I have a hard time following the yoga moves from pictures and words. Maybe that is a follow up item for Mariel?"
4,Refreshingly well written,"I purchased this book because the author caught my attention and I was looking for a book to provide me with tips on health from inside out.The book is well written from a perspective from someone that has experienced difficulties with health, exercise and self-image and truly understands the battles we face. I must say her personal approach and tips are very helpful.The book is easy to ready, lots of common sense tips that are realistic in our busy and stressful lifestyle. It is also very forgiving, in a sense that, she acknowledges the mistakes and pitfall that we do because after all we are human and provides you with tips on how to deal with that.I really enjoy the book.. I read it before I go to bed, refreshes my mind and gives me positive reinforcement and I try to apply her techniques and we should all try to live our lives healthy from inside out one day at a time."
3,Donde lo he oido?,"Solo he escuchado el primer sencillo: ""Midnight"".Me llama mucho la atención que siendo de Guadalajara, esta niña decida grabar su primer disco totalmente en inglés (siento como un retroceso de 20 años).¡Ah! ya me acorde a quien se parece la voz de esta tapatía, es más, ""Midnight"" es exagerada y grotescamente parecida a la música de los Hanson.Pero repito... no he tenido oportunidad de escuchar el resto del disco, por ahi oi que tiene algo de Norah Jones, será?Luego les platico."
4,Wise Advice,"I love Super Soakers and this gun is no exception. It is great for hot summer days, but does not feature a CPS (Constant Pressure System) which makes it harder to pump. Still, this gun is very enjoyable and will send shivers down other's spines! Oh, and for the price, it may be one of the best deals ever!"
2,Fun while it lasted - by Viscen Django,"This gun was really fun while it lasted. 3 days after I got it, the trigger valve broke and the gun stopped working. Do not buy this gun unless you want a gun that will break after 3 days of using it. Take it from me, an experienced water warrior: DO NOT BUY THIS GUN."
4,Great!!!!!!!!!,This toy is cool.When I had my friend test it on me it was cold.the only problem with it is it can shoot only 15-20 feet but this toy was still cool.
2,I HATE IITT!!,"This gun is the worst! You could just put ice in a normalwater gun, instead of the ""ICE CORE"".All this water gundoes is make them cold.I prefer more of the BLAST of water.Like for example the FLASH FLOOD super soaker.Capacity wise, I like this water gun.Over all I would notbuy this gun."
1,This toy is worthless,You can pump this worthless toy all day and it has maybe a 15 ft range for at least a few seconds. This does not do anything it's advertised to do. And the 30' range is total fantasy. I wasted $19 and it's now in the trash where it belongs.
2,Don't Buy!,"This gun is one of the new guns from the 2005 soakertag elite line. This year Hasbro releases four new guns in theis line. Two were CPS, meaning Constant Pressure system, and two were air pressure. This gun was one of the air pressure, meaning it's not as powerful as the two other guns in the CPS line. This guns only pro is that the water it shoots is cold, andyou can hardle consider that a pro. You can fill up any other gun with chilly water and shoot it too. The downsides to this gun are many. First of all the range, while most soakers reach over 35 feet, this one doesn't even make 30. Also the power is lack luster. The nozzle on this gun is tiny! Lastly it is much too heavy, it doesn't look heavy, but it is. It is quite hard to run around with. Instead of buying this gun, you should buy the Aquapack Devastator or the Flash Flood. They are much better and feature CPS tech."

5,Zim's crack cream excellent product,Zim's crack cream really works well to heal the cracks in my fingers caused by Michigan cold weather. It works faster than any other product tried.
3,Clever,"This is a clever device. All studies show that cats train better through rewards and not punishments, which is why I bought this.It really only took my cat a day to learn to use this scratching post. My problem is that he has learned to push the outer tube up so that it falls on the lever and drops food. He also has a tendency to bite it instead of scratch it to get food. I have yet to see him actually scratch it.I think this product needs to be a bit taller for it to really be used as a scratching post, but it's a great idea, and if you really work with your cat you may be able to get him to use it as it ought to be. The fact that you can fill the bottom with litter or sand to keep it stable also really helps."
1,Doesn't work,"My cat refused to scratch the post. When he did, he did not have the power or the intellect to push the product down, instead I was doing it for him. If you see the product pic is lopsided, it will get to that every time you get frustrated and push down on the unit yourself. It will get more slanted the more you push it yourself. You will also get irritated seeing a lopsided feeder in your room. Not recommended for purchase. There are better alternatives to food holders."
1,Waste of money,"Cat didn't care for it. Never used it as a scratcher. Broke within a month, and is now adding to a landfill's contents. Terrible purchase; I would not recommend it."
4,I can't stop listening to it......,"Naxos is my first choice for a classical music label, and this is just another reason why. A superb performance. The ONLY reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because i don't own another label's release of this work, and it didn't seem totally objective. However, i have heard the work plenty of times and i like this release enough to not buy another performance. You can listen to this over and over and not get bored. The bass and soprano performances are especially wonderful, and i really like the way the organ is blended with the orchestra (you can actually hear it)--it results in a wonderful sound. This is overall a wonderful interpretation--and at that wonderful Naxos price (compare this one with others for sale here). Thank you Naxos for another great performance at another great price--keep it up. Buy this one."
5,Classic 70s Cheez,Caught this film at 2:00 am on late night television. Couldn't believe that someone was able to get financing to produce it. So naturally I had to get it on DVD. It's so bad it's good. Classic 70s Velveeta. Definitely in the spirit of Dolemite! Love it.
3,Sharp Pokey Things...Go BUMP In The Night.,"A little boy has a traumatic event happen to his parents (Nooo,Not HARRY POTTER),More like Michael Myers sister in Classic Halloween movie.Why years later his Ghost ? Doppelganger ? or Copycat is wearing a welders helmet and Leather apron to off people boggles me.Forgot title detail the parents were killed with a crow bar,Get it,And now whoever moves into their family home is offed with a crow bar.The suspense,Like mentioned is very classic in theme and rare these days.There are some truly scary moments and bits of acting from Michael Ray Clark.I wonder if Harbor Freight Tools knows how some of there products are used ,In none standard ways ?"
5,New Slant on the Dillinger Story,"Superbly researched and crammed with amazing facts and enough information to satiate the most rabid gangster buff, Ellen Poulsen has crafted the Dillinger case anew from a different perspective, the amazing case histories of the gang's women. Billie Frechette, Polly Hamilton, Mary Kinder, Helen Gillis, Opal Long, Pat Cherrington, Anna Sage and all the rest emerge in their own right, not as cardboard gun molls, but as three-dimensional women, products of their time and environment, and an integral part of the Dillinger story. This is a must-read for crime aficionados and an excellent addition to the ever-growing library of '30's gangster books."
4,Good Book,"I've read more books than I care to have read about Dillinger because I give tours at the cemetery in Indianapolis where he is buried with his mom and dad. I found this book to be one of the more interesting. It's been awhile since I read it and it seems like I found a few errors that only somebody who lives in Indy would notice, but otherwise it was a good book and worth getting if you are interested in the subject matter."
3,The Truth Behind the Headlines,"I believe that anyone who is interested in the Middle Western crime wave during the Great Depression is sure to enjoy this book. Ellen Poulsen leaves no stone unturned in this meticulously researched chronicle of the women behind the public enemies who shot their way into the headlines during the Thirties. The author provides us with a wealth of little known facts about Evelyn Frechette, Marie Conforti (real name Comforti), the Delaney sisters, Bess Green, Opal Long, Helen Gillis (Mrs. Baby Face Nelson), and scores of others who, through a combination of sheer misfortune and tough times, shared the beds of some of the most notorious outlaws in the annals of U.S. crime. An informative book which furnishes insight into the sad lives led by the ""gun molls"" glamorized by the press."
2,NOT the original Misa Luba,"Yet again Philips/Universal screws up. This is NOT the original recording of the Misa Luba; this one is pretty, but pales in comparison. I looked on the Decca UK website, and it lists these three masses, with a different cover, and states that the item includes both ""the original 1960s recording"" of the Misa Luba, along with the 1990 DVD version. I guess Philips doesn't think Americans will accept this earlier recording, and makes it available only in other countries. Corporate stupidity rules."
4,ONLY ONE WAY STILL TO HEAR THE REAL MISA LUBA,and that is to get the English version of Pasolini's Gospel of Saint Matthew. Somehow the Misa Luba turns up as incidental and ending music instead of that orchestrated by the director! IOn any case it is an essential DVD [...]and for the Misa Criolla instead of Carreras's reverence get the great and reverend voice of Mother Earth herself in Mercedes Sosa's Misa Criolla
3,Pity,It is a pity that such a good voice is waisted in performing these wonderful messes which really require to be sung with the folkloric touch in which they were conceived and written
1,Misa Criolla/Misa Luba/Misa Flamenca,I had a version on a 33 record album from the 60's which broke. It was by sung by a Congolese Tribe beating their drums and was fantastic. That is what I was really looking for.
4,Toujours moi,Toujours Moi FOR WOMEN by Max Factor - 2.0 oz EDC Spray (By Dana)I really love it !The fragrance is like a dream !
5,Great Reading,The scum of the earth have taken over the city streets...now a special fighting force will battle to win them back!
4,Excellent book!,"""Stalkers"" is a great collection of short stories with a very sinister streak. While some tales are not as good as others, the book overall is definitely worth reading time. In fact, the story about disfigured Air Force cadets who hate truckers and the tale, ""Mother Tucker"", are worth the price of the book alone."
3,unsatisfied,This paddle was not of the caliber I was expecting. I wish I had spent a few dollars more for the Stiga or Butterfly paddles.
1,"it's Solid Ad, while the product is not!","I bought this racket ""PRP900 Pro Speed 900 Professional Table Tennis Racket"", but at the first hit against a TT ball I realized that it is far from the words that describe the racket in the ads at Amazon.com. This is a regular device for amateurs with 2-3 pieces of skills in Ping-Pong. I am disappointed in the money I spent on this. First time in my experience with Amazon.com. Thank you."
5,Confidence Building - We Can Do It!,"Take Your Kids to Europe delivers the feeling that even if you haven't travelled a great deal or haven't been to Europe with your kids, there is no mystery to it all. You don't have to be a jet set family, you simply think things through, examine your family dynamics, get everyone involved and go! The author helps you understand, especially through examples, that you need to adjust your itineraries to kids' ages and interests. Some of the best times are the unexpected ones and you need to leave yourselves and your plans open for simply soaking in your destination.Required reading for any family planning a European trip.P L ByrneAuthor of Italy Discovery Journal"
4,Good,"Hidden Treasures is a small, thin paperback book, but it is full of neat things. I always love learning new things that are within the Scriptures. Definitely worth reading! Wish there had been more ""hidden treasures"" - - - I thought the book was too short."
3,"[Three-and-a-half stars out of five] Not completely necessary, but a good read","This book is guaranteed to stimulate,provoke and hoepfully dusturb. Missler'slast book wasn't this good. RevisionistHistorian Mike Hoffman, II can't standhim, but at least you can get along withMissler. I may not agree with everythingin here but being a Christian and an eter-nal truth seeker, you can do far worse bynot giving this book a fair read. Price isright here on Amazon, too!"
2,the bottom of the barrel,"Lakeside Classics were really scraping the bottom of the barrel re-printing this one. This is mostly just a long list of whiny complaints about the author's hard-luck in his efforts to trade with the Indians. He made three attemmpts and lost his shirt big-time each time.There's some occasional nice material about frontier travel and interactions with the Indians, but the author's bitter, self-absorbed attitude always intrudes and spoils it. Charles Larpenteur's narrative and Chardon's journal shared this miserable attitude. After all, these guys weren't out there for their health, selflessly bringing civilized enlightenment to the poor savages. It was a rough and tumble life and they took a lot of hard knocks, and some of them didn't take it with much good grace.You're better off reading Ross Cox (but beware for the Narrative Press edition) or Alexander MacKenzie's journal, or just about anything besides this bad-smelling item."
4,Good but he has done better.,"Steve Jones ROCKS!! But not so much on this disc. Great songs but a bit mellow. Get ""Fire and Gasoline"" before you get this one."
3,"Long on rhythm, short on melody","Despite strong, powerful guitar work and capable production, Jones offers here a rather bland and forgettable release. The title track (and leadoff tune) starts things well with its insinuating refrain and melancholy feel, but the uptempo rockers that follow are hard to get a hold of. Jones is not a very distinctive vocalist -- not a crime, sure -- but a mediocre singer had better bring along some very catchy tunes, and Jones does not. The 'sound' of this album is great: clean, crunchy guitar rock with lots of great, slashing rhythms, but unfortunately very few memorable hooks. The result is a disc that will make you tap your toes while it's playing, but that you will quickly forget once it's done."
5,Good stuff. A bit big for some small fish.,"I use this in my community tank with bettas, celestial pearl danios, various otos, and pygmy cories, in rotation with Golden Pearls from Brine Shrimp Direct, fruit flies, Hikari Micropellets, and the occasional frozen bloodworm or brine shrimp. My kids' betta-and-terta tanks use this pretty much exclusively. Definitely improved the color of my bettas as well as the CPDs and the tetras: color improved very noticeably right after adding this in to the rotation. All fish love it and are thriving. However, it's a bit big for my CPDs to handle unless it's been chomped and spit out a few times. But a good ""compromise"" for something very healthy that bettas as well as smaller fish will eat: allowed me to eliminate betta pellets. This is much better in a community setting. Ideal for tetras."
3,more depth please,"I was unimpressed by the lack of depth in this book. I was expecting something more ""hands on""."
3,Cute but not exactly what I was looking for,"I love Todd Parr's work - it's clever and colorful. Still, this particular book isn't what I hoped. I was looking for something high-contrast for my 1-month-old to enjoy. While the illustrations are indeed black and white, they're often on dark blue backgrounds or other low-contrast colors, so this book isn't for newborns. I think in a month or two it will be fun to go through the book with the baby and point at the pictures, but I'm not sure long-term how much it will keep him entertained, as there's only one word on each page and not a lot to discuss about each picture. Some of Parr's other books have more opportunity to spark interaction beyond the simple pictures and text."
3,good condition as well as movie,The movies story line is little bit off balance and bounces. The art work is great within this anime and they still have parts to grab the attention to keep it interesting.
3,What's the point?,"I didn't really care for this anime as much as i thought I would. The action sequences were amazing but the story seemed pointless to me. The last episode, I thought, had the most substance."
5,I highly recommend this book,I read The Boy of Wilna about 34 years ago when I was 12. It immersed me in the Vilna of 280 years ago and brought to life the childhood of the Vilna Gaon in such a way that the story remains vivid for me to this day.
5,My Personal Favorite,"My grandfather collected and owned every original Lous L'Amour western novel. When I was 15 he passed the collection onto me. While this is not the best example of L'Amour's work it is certinaly my favorite. Another favorite of mine is ""Last of the Breed"", but ""Fair Blows the Wind"" is the book that I come back to read over and over time and again. I would recommend this book to anyone. No book collection is complete without this."
3,probe review,I bought this for a garden to keep check of soil temps well sometimes it works sometimes it dont and an outdoor sensor that should not get wet oh well better not rain on it. Wish I would have looked a little farther you get what you pay for.
2,Good for only about 2 years,"I purchased this in July of 2009. It's now 2 years later and it's finally time to replace the batteries because the display has gotten overly dim. After replacing the batteries, the digital numbers for the indoor and outdoor temperatures has gone bad. The warranty is good for only 1 year and is limited. So I'm out of luck. Granted, it wasn't an overly expesnive buy, but my next thermometer purchase won't be a La Cross. Maybe my expectations are too high for such an inexpensive thermometer. I""m just expecting the display to last as long as the display on an inexpensive digital watch, which is 10+ years."
3,GOOD TEMPERATURE INDICATOR,"First of all this doesn't have a 10 foot cord for the temperature sender, it is 6 foot. I called La Crosse and was told that version has been discontinued over a year ago. The distributors are using an old advertisement to sell that model. That is false advertising! It works fine except for the too short cord. I put a ziplock bag over the unit since it is not waterproof but it collects condensation in the bag. I keep track of the temperature of my KOI pond and it works fine for that. The temperature is off by 2 degrees which isn't bad. Don't leave the remote sensor in the sun or it will cook itself and quit working. I learned that from a remote sensor I had last year. THE 10 FOOT CORD WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER!!!!"
3,OK for the price,The display is not good you have to look at it like a wrist watch to get the reading. The out side probe sensitive to sun light under direct sun light the the temparatute display is way above the actual. But for the price I was not expecting a great unit.
2,"Works ok, Doesnt relay Humidity From Wireless unit","THIS UNIT TENDS TO DROP THE SIGNAL A BIT, AND IT LACK THE HUMIDITY DATA FROM THE WIRELESS MONITER, SO ID RECOMEND LOOKING FOR A MORE RELIABLE UNIT WITH DUAL READINGS, AND IT WILL ONLY COST YOU ANOTHER 5 DOLLARS OR SO, MY LOCAL HYDRO STORE HAD ONE FOR 33.00 I BOUGHT IT AFTER I RECIEVED THESE AND WAS NOT SATISFIED."
1,Don't get this item,"Rare that I write a review, but this item is junk and the La Crosse is useless. Try to get something fixed within the warrenty period is a hassle, lots of emails just asking questions. Then they want you to pay shipping back on a the junk they put out. Don't buy this or anything from La Crosse Technology, not worth it in any way."
4,Saves you opening windows or stepping outside,"Good unit, has decent range, and is so convenient that you can look to see what the temp is outside, without having to go outside. I am not a nerdy person, but I look at the screen before I leave every morning to know what to wear.Definitely make sure to remote sensor does not get direct sunlight, as it will suggest it's 50C outside when it might only be 28C.All in all, a really useful gadget."
2,Ridiculouly hard to set up,"Pro: Good range, seems accurateCons: The setup and adjust procedures are just terrible. Even setting the time is a chore that requires the manual. And I really dread replacing the batteries in the remote sensor, since I have to get a ladder and climb up to get the sensor, bring the display to the same location and then go through a ridiculous ritual of removing both sets of batteries, putting batteries in the sensor, then immediately putting the batteries in the display. Then repeat a few times until it works. Then climb the ladder again, and reset the time on the display.Good technology completely spoiled by a horrible user interface and silly set up requirements. Too bad."
1,"local display seems accurate, but remote sensor and probe are way off","The local display unit works great and the temperature seems fairly accurate. The remote sensor, on the other hand, which is hidden in a medium size shrub to keep it out of the sun, reports the temp about 5-8 degrees too high consistently. The remote wired sensor probe, which I am using to monitor pool water temps, is also high by between 7-10 degrees.The number of degrees that the remote sensor and it's probe are off changes at different times of the day. The water temp in the pool stays roughly constant during the day, but the remote probe is just wrong most of the time. None of this seems related to being outside as it was also off, although not as much, when I was testing inside the house before moving it for use around the pool.I am wishing that I never bought this unit."
4,Nice Product,Nice product.After two weeks it is working well. Wireless so far has worked as indicated.It does not record time and date of min/max recording which I wanted.
1,a piece of junk,"This is a piece of 'merde'! Pardon my french. I bought this to check my pool temperature. The first one the probe temperature was off by 5 degrees. I returned and requested another one, same different! Buy this unit if you want some brain exercises because you always have to do addition or subtraction to get accurate reading."
2,Temp probe is useless,"It is sad as the outdoors unit is fairly accurate but the probe is almost useless. If there was a linear difference between the probe's reading and the hot tub thermometer then fine, I could deal with that, ie, add two degrees, etc. but alas, there isn't. For example, when the hot tub is running and showing a temperature of 103, the probe might be showing 105.3 or 104.6 or 104 or who knows."
1,Unit simply don't work!,"Bought first unit, outdoor Sensor did not scan between channels. Returned it to Amazon for replacement and second unit the outdoor sensor would not give the correct reading. When probe was in freezing cold water gauge says 60 degrees.Returened this unit for credit only!Recommend LaCrosse check these units out. I think they are all defective!"
3,This unit is okay,It is very finicy where the outside sensor can be placed but it serve teh purpose - I wish I had spent the extra money for a better unit...
1,Not for Canadians,As far as I can tell you are unable to set the wall mount to Celsius.And if to set the desktop unit to Celsius then it has to be on a 24 hr clock.Come on... in this day and age these settings should be simple.
5,Great Product,I am using this to montior our guest house which is about 200 feet from the main house since I have the heat down when noone is using it. I also purchased an additional remote that I have in our wine cellar to monitior the temperature in that room. The unit works better then I thought it would and has three seperate channels.
4,"""Hot Water Heater"" freeze protection monitor","My hot water heater is located in the attic and is equipped with a ""Easy Heat"" heater tape to keep the lines from freezing. I taped the probe (displays as Input #2 on the base unit) on the cold water supply line and am now able to read the attic ambient (displays as Input #1 on the base unit) and pipe wall temperatures remotely. (I just felt like I needed a ""back-up"" to know for sure the heater tape was functioning properly. Couldn't find a less expensive alternative anywhere! Only reason for not giving five stars is because the unit lacks an alarm point setting capability."
1,A Gamble.,"If this were to work it would be a good deal. Outdoor sensor is in error by at least 8 degrees celcius after a month of ownership. A few weeks later the indoor sensor went, reporting higher by 10 degree celcius.Piece of garbage now."
4,Handy temperature instrument,This Lacrosse product is the perfect wireless temperature gauge for the person who needs to know what's happening outside.This is not the fanciest one of these. It does however work just fine. It's easy to setup and actually has two outdoor sensors in the same module.
1,Tech Support/RMA non-existent,"I purchased a similar unit, and the remote temperature sensor quit working after about 2 months. Worse, support from La Crosse Technology is MIA. I submitted a form on their web site--no response. I called their tech support hotline 3 times. No answer. I left 2 voice mails. Nobody has returned my call. That's inexcusable."
4,Does the job,"I use this to monitor the temperature in my green hoop for growing vegetables over the winter. Able to monitor soil temperature as well as air temperature from one sensor. Not sure if unit can stand the high humidity, so wrapped in plastic."
2,Sensor did not work,Have used these before and bought this replacement package. The sensor will not work. Nothing happens at all. It is nearly impossible to find a way to get the company to honor its warranty. After 2 attempts and nearly an hour I realized I was spending more of my time than the unit was worth. Also the unit has more printed info on it than the picture and there is no model number on it. Odd. The receiver does work with the spare sensor that I bought.
1,Sad!,"Purchased this unit to keep track of my hot tub temperature. It reads 5 degrees hire then the actual temperature in the hot tub. Plus the inside unit is not accurate, this reads 3-4 degrees lower then the actual temperature. I guess $ 20 selling price should have been the clue!"
4,works perfectly (almost),"I have put the remote unit (including 2nd sensor probe) on the top of a 30' frost protection tower. It is wrapped in a cloth and plastic bag to protect from weather exposure. I can read this reliably from inside my house, about 200' away and through two walls. This gives me an indication of differential temperatures from any inversion layer which is necessary for the frost protection in my vineyard. It's been up for over a month in cold and warm, wet and dry conditions and works fine. The only drawback (hence 4 stars) is the different reading from the remote and probe sensors, even though they are enclosed in the same wrapping. The differance is not great, varying from 0.0 to 1.0 degree. Ideally they would always be identical, but my experience with digital thermometers is that they never read identically.Overall, an excellent remote unit."
1,What a disappointment. just a candy bar,First If I could have rated this ZERO STARS.. I would havI would like to say I am a regular eater of protein bars. This is NOTHING like that rather a cut down version of a crunchy candy bar..1. it is extremely SMALL.. it didn't even fill the modest size package that is was wrapped in. Approx 2/3 of the size of a usual bar2. it is Thin as well as short...3. Extremely sweet and modest crunch4. It might only measure 90 calories but most of those come from simple Sugar- the first 3 ingredients are SUGAR...So if you want a sugar high fine but if your are looking for a healthy low cal mid meal snack that is healthy find another bar there are loads of them out there.So inconclusion this is a cut down candy bar faking it as a healthy low calorie item. Kellogg You can do way better than this !!!
3,Great if you like sugar and don't mind partially hydrogenated oils,"These are quite tasty if you like sugar or sweets (I do), but they contain partially hydrogenated oil. For taste alone, I would give these 5 stars for people who like sweets. For people who want a healthy snack, I wouldn't recommend these. Overall I am giving it 3 stars because while these may taste good, it's only due to being very sweet due to lots of sugar and corn syrup. Also, while the impression may be that these are good for you being only 90 calories (it's only a .8 ounce bar anyway), I certainly wouldn't say they are. They also contain artificial flavors."
2,DISAPPOINTINGLY BLAH,"Special K Bars, Vanilla Crisp, 6 - .8 oz Bars , (Pack of 12)I ordered this item as an addition to my low calorie diet foods. I was extremely dissapointed in the fact that they have absolutely no taste and were very small. I have eaten other low cal bars made by Special K which were good, but the recipe for these should be discarded. I do not recommend this item to anyone who is looking for a low cal bar which also tastes good. Kellogs you missed the boat with this one."
1,Not the songs listed.,"A family member ordered this CD for me for Christmas, but when it came the titles listed were not the same as on this website and there were only 8 of them, not 16. This needs to be corrected, so I do not suggest you order this CD at the current time."
1,Listing is just plain wrong,"As mentioned by others, there are only 8 songs on this disc. Strange that it hasn't been updated."
5,Classy Chairs,They are so comfortable and so trendy looking. They really make a great impression when you see them in my kitchen. They are easy to clean off if you spill something on them. I highly recommend them. They are excellent.
