4,A great read with your grandchildren,My grandson recommended this book that he was reading in school. It was wonderful to share different aspects of the book and the insight of a ten year old reading about the adult problems the characters encountered in this story.
5,"the book title should be ""helping the stars""","this is a story about anne-marie and her family helping her friend ellen to escape from the germans. I like this story cuz it shows adventure, bravery, and friendship. I think the book should be called ""Helping the Stars"" because it shows how anne_marie and her family help their friends to escape a horrible time. If you like adventure i recomend this book to you and everyone else who likes a good story."
5,A Review of a Great Book: Number the Stars,We read this book in a reading group in fifth grade. Since it is such a great book we read it again in the seventh grade. This book was a great book yet it was very sad to learn how some people struggled during that time. This book teaches on how you should cherish the things you have and not take them for granted. It showed how people were treated back then during the war. It toled of how Hitler treated the Jewish people even though they never even did anything. It was a great book and taught us a lot of the values of life as in the book all the people had to deal with all deaths of family and friends looking forward to their own death as well. We recommend this book to everyone because it can teach everyone a thing or two.
5,Read this nearly 20 years ago when I was a kid.,"I've read this book as a young child and I always recommend this book to people.By now, I forgot all about it, but when I was a little kid, I always loved this novel. I am going to buy it for a friend, maybe after I read it again."
5,Number the Stars,I think this is a very good book that is very informative on what might have happened to hundereds of jewish during the houlocaust. Even thought it was a fictional book it has a very good insight of what might have happened and it is very exciting and I would recomend it to any one that would enjoys reading about the history of the holocaust.
3,It was okay,I thought it was okay but it wasn't my favorite book. It got kind of boring beacause it sounds like the author ran out of ideas close to the end of the book. Some parts were funny though. Like when Thor (the cat) fell into the milking pail.
3,a title?,"this was a good book that teaches you about some history. It is very short and would recomend it to anyone with a bit of spare time willing to learn about the nazis in Denmark. It also contains a few fairytales included in some of the more suspenseful scenes. The best part is that you can read it over and over. I am disappointed, though, that of course it has a happy ending."
3,Slow but good.,"I admire the feeling and the power of the words, being a Jew myself, but I can't read books in an hour unless they are fast enough to keep me in suspense. This took me a week, on and off, to read it completely.I admire this book's description, I felt like I was really there watching Ellen and Annemarie's mothers sipping their hot water and herbs in the kitchen. I could visualize the scene in which little sister Kirstie complained about her shoes, made out of fish skin. I admire the perfect description of Ellen's generosity, her shyness, her honesty. But the story wasn't really entrancing enough to get me to the end. I admire the author's purpose and the afterword, but all in all this is not a great book."
4,decent,trust me this is a good book i hated sadako and the thousand paper cranes that book was terrible but this one kicked the crap outta sadako i love adventure stories and this is a good one
4,NO spoiling for you!,"I suggest you to read this book. This book has plenty of words and expression to maybe, write a letter. This is a happy and sad story. Well, I really hate those German soliders, because I really hate war. Why do people have war ?! What I don't understand was why does the Germans wants to attack the Jewish? Find out yourself"
5,Number the Stars Review,"Number the stars shows you what it was like for children during the Holocaust. In the book their are two ten year old girls Annemarie Johansens and Ellen Rosen. The Nazis come to take Ellen and her family away so her parents send their daughter to the Johansens. I thought the story was a very good portrayal of what 1943 Denmark was like. The book helps you understand what genocide is and how horrible this period of time was for people. I think the book is a good choice for people to read. It is not fake, it is very realistic it doesn't have your sugar coated necessarily happy ending. It throws in real life endings, situations, and outcomes that is desperately needed in young adult books."
5,Number the Stars,"I got to read the book by my cousin because she introduced the book to me and after I read the book, I thought that it was the most greatest and interesting book I have ever read.The book was about two girls named Anne Marie and Ellen. Ellen and her family was Jewish and this was during the Holocaust, so when Ellen's parents went to hide in a safer country, Ellen went to go live with Anne Marie and her family and disguised herself as Anne Marie's other sister, who died long ago. It took place in Denmark during the 1940s.I liked the book because it had alot of meaning to me. I read the book over and over because I thought that it was a marvelous and faboluous book. I recommend this book to everyone because it teaches you what life was back then and what two friends meant to each other."
4,One of the best!,Number the Stars by Lois Lowry is an awesome book. It is about a little girl who protects her friend. Her family is very strong and brave and its a page turner. I would definatly recommend this book to all readers who are interested in books dealing with some problems but it turns out good in the end.
4,Number The Stars,"I am African American/Hispanic, and I think that it is very important to teach children about the struggles that each race has endured throughout history, and this book, 'Number The Stars' has proven to be an excellant learning tool. It tells a story affilliated with the holocaust."
5,5 Stars for Number the stars,"This is an excellent book that talks about a difficult subject. This book is amazingly well written, touching, and appropriate for the age group for which it is written. So oftne this subject is watered down to make it palatable for young audiences. Usually, that means it gets dumbed down. Not in this book, Lois Lowry writes knowing that kids can understand and be moved and inspired by the events in this book. It has children as the main characters, ones that are experincing the same problems all 11 -12 year olds are, with the added complication of WW2. This makes the subject less like a history lecture, and more like a lesson in human endurance.I think this book is an excellent book for anyone, not just children."
5,best book ever wrote,I think this book is the best i've ever read because of the characters courage and bravery during world war 2. I think if you like books about wars and friendship and escapes you should read this book.
4,best book ive ever read,it wasent so great at the begining and then it got ok then better.i mostly liked it when kirsti asked if they were going to have cupcakes.i relate to kirsti the most because i love cupcackes like her.im also like annemire because i stick up for my friends a lot.
3,This book is good.,This book was interesting but it wasn't a great book.It told me how it was during WW2 but some parts were boring. That's why I rated it 3 Stars.
5,great book!!,"My granddaughter,11, read this on our vacation, and she told me she absolutely loved it!"
5,Number the Stars,"This book is historical fiction. It's about a ten year old girl named Annemarie Johansen and her best friend Ellen Rosen, during 1943 when Hitler is killing the Jews. Their life in Copenhagen is filled with school, food shortages and Nazi soldiers marching in their town.The Nazis won't stop searching for the Jews. The Jews of Denmark are being relocated, so Ellen moves in with the Johansens and pretends to be part of their family. While her mom and dad are hiding somewhere else she stays at that family. One day Annemarie is asked by her mom to go on a dangerous mission to save the lives of her best friend and her family.The part of this story that happened to Lise and Peter is really sad. If any likes sad stories you should read this book and find out what was really sad."
5,"Besides harry potter, the best book ever",I liked this book because it was about the nazis taking over denmark and was a lot like the diary of anne frank but much better.
3,Number the Stars,"I liked the book, even though it is typically not my type of book. Number the Stars is a good book to learn about World War II. The reason why I liked this book is because one family is trying to save another family from the Nazis. They had to go through a lot oftrouble to get them safely to Sweden."
3,Not my cup of tea,"It is about a girl named Anmarie and her best friend Ellen. All the Jews in their town are being relocated, and Anmarie and her family are helping Ellan's family to escape. I didn't really like the book, but I was supposed to read it two years before I finally did. Still, it involves caring, trust, fear, and... commitment?"
5,Number the Stars book review,Number the Stars By: Lois LowryNumber the Stars is a book about the Holocaust. It takes place in Denmark during the 1940s. There are 2 girls that are best friends named Anne Marie and Ellen. Ellen is Jewish and the Nazis were invading their neighborhood and taking all of the Jewish people to concentration camps. Ellen's parents left for a safer country and Ellen stayed with Anne Marie and her family. The book is very good and wonderful to read. It is a quick read but very worthwhile. I think the book teaches a very good lesson. The moral of the story is: no matter what someone's religion is doesn't mean they are a bad person. We need to look past what people believe in and realize the type of person they are. I recommend this book to all ages. It has a great lesson and is a great story.
3,This is a good book to introuduce Children to the holocaust,This book is a good book to introuduce children to the milder horrors of the holocaust. It shows some parts of Jewish culture and the mainstream society of germany. I would have given it 3 1/2 stars but they STILL won't let us use halfs so it won't be averaged in...
5,Brilliant,"Annemarie is living in dangerous times, Denmark, 1943, during the Nazi occupation. Soldiers line the streets and harass the citizens daily. One day, Annemarie's family learns that the Nazis have decided to relocate the Jews living in Denmark. Annemarie's best friend and her parents are suddenly forced to find a way to get out of Denmark. It is Annemarie and her family who are able to help.This was an exciting adventure story with scary Nazis popping up on every page. I read along, anxiously, to find out whether Annemarie's friends would manage to flee Copenhagen and sail across to safety in Sweden."
4,You have to read this too,"Lois Lowry shows interesting views in her award- winning story, Number the Stars. Its about the power of friendship during World War II's hard times in Europe. I truely loved this book , because it taught me the power of friendship, courage, loss, and survival."
5,One of the best best books I've read!,This book is really good! It was so good it made me cry! I warn all of the people who hate sad books don't read this book! Lois Lowry is one of my favorite authors!
4,interesting ... you never want to put it down,"This is one of those books where you never want to put it down. I read it in just a few days. A girl, AnneMarie, is forced to live with soldiers all over her town during WWII. Her best friend, Ellen, is jewish and the soldiers are taking over the town. The girls are very afraid. I tried to put myself in both of their positions and I figured that it would be really scary and I wouldn't know what to do. The book is very suspensful and it's hard to tell whats going to happen next. I reccommend it to readers of all ages."
5,a good mix of best friends and ww2,"I had to read this book for my reading class.I thought what a drag !, was I surprised. We had to read one chapter a night, I ended up reading three. This book is about best friends who join the fight for freedom for Jewish people. The end of the book is happy, but also sad. I wanted to keep reaing the book and didn't want it to end. If you want to read a fictional book on a real topic, you should definitely read this book."
5,A must read book!,"This book is an intertaining story of a Jewish girl, Ellen, who is hidden from the Nazis by a Danish friend, Anne Marie and her family. The developing relationship between the two girls leads to a strong bond that endures through difficult times. Anticipation increases as the Nazis move closer! You'll want to keep reading!This is an excellent book to incorporate cultural diversity and character development into your classroom. This era in history is fascinating and is an excellent outlet for integrating social studies as well as language arts. A time line would be an excellent activity to track the Nazi movement throughout WWII."
5,BEST BOOK,I read this book after a girl in my class read it for a report. It took me an hour but it was one of the best books I ever read i recomennd this book if you are interested in the holocaust. So read this Louis Lowry will be happy
5,An Amazing Novel,"""Help! The Nazis are invading Denmark. There are German soldiers everywhere!"" Discover what it was really like in 1943, when all the Jews were in danger. This book is full of suspense. I would recommend this book to anyone."
4,This is a must read book!,"As a sixth grade student I was unaware of what the holocaust was until I read, Number The Stars, by Louis Lowry. It takes place in Denmark, and the main character is Annemarie Johansen. This story is set in World War II.This is a must read book. It is a sad story about war, friends, and family. This book is heart touching. Lois Lowry writes this story detailing the holocaust so that young people can understand the reason why it all started.Lois Lowry is a very interesting person to study on. A few interesting facts I learned about when I was studying her was, her home is filled with books were she gets her ideas for her great books . Another interesting fact about Lois Lowry is she made her own system like the Dewey Decimal system. In order to find out more about this book you will have to read it!"
4,must read book,"I've read Number the Stars by Lois Lowry. It was a good book about a girl named Anamarie, Anamarie was on mission to save her fried named Ellen from Nazi's. Anamarie was making a plan to save Ellen who is in Germany. This story of friendship shows the responsibility held in Anamarie's eyes because of a certain promise that she made to her best friend.This is an amazing book that must be read. This book is about the holocaust that occurred during WW1. Most kids my age, do not know about the tragedy the Jews went through. The holocaust tells how Germans tortured the Jews and many others."
5,Great Book,"Number the Stars is a wonderful book! You should definately read it! It is about a girl who has a friend who is Jewish and the Nazis want to capture her in WW2. They hide in Sweeden and they hide at their Uncle's House. They capture Peter who helps The friend hide.I also made an acrostic why you should read it.Great Book!Reading is funExciting momments in the bookAll of the book has detailsTerriffic Story.That is why you should read it. For people who like Fantasy, they would like this book."
5,number the stars,Number the stars was a great book. It had alot of interestingthings happening . The book was mysterious and exciting. I would recommend this book to everyone. Because it was a great book...
5,a 12 year old reader,I think that number the stars is a good book .I think lowis lowry did a great job writting this book.If something I laerned from this book is to love others because someday they might be gone.If I didn't read this book I wouldn't what I missed out on I recemend this book to you' my family' and friends.
5,Book Review,"The thunderous noises on Kristi's birthday were not fireworks...Annemarie and Ellen are two best friends. Ellen's Family is Jewish and in that time, Ellen's family, The Rosen's and many more were the target. When the Nazis started invading Copenhagen, Ellen stayed with Annemarie as her sister Lise, who died two years ago. Can the Rosen's and the other be able to be able to get out without getting caught? Will Annemarie get to see Ellen ever again?I think this book is amazing! It taught me more about World War ll. This book kept me at the tip of my chair and wanted me to keep reading. Annemarie and Ellen's friendship connected with Allie's and me. Number the Stars, by Lois Lowry is one of the most tragic and terrifying but also the best book I've read. I hope this book is a book to remember."
3,"DARK, EXPLICIT AND SOMETIMES BIZARRE","The dark, haunting cover foreshadows the disturbing malevolence that seeps from its pages. The voices of these collaborating authors are sinister, and every author is well-known in the mystery/suspense genre. But before you drop $21.95 for this book, be aware that these are not stories of murder and intrigue, but of death and misery. They are short stories with odd characters, titillating content, and startling revelations or actions. These stories reach the depths of obsession, insanity, and sin to show the deep, dark, even perverse sides of their characters, chilling readers to the core.The stories take place in America and England at various times in history, and each chapter and each life is linked to a certain charm. The first story -- an erotic tale -- shows how a bracelet is cursed. It goes on from there...._Like a Charm_ is for readers who like their stories dark, explicit, and sometimes bizarre."
1,I was extremely disappointed!,"I really wanted to give this one a try, but where there was potential, this novel failed. I hate to say it, but while I thought the premise was extremely creative...just imagine the story behind a charm bracelet and it's charms, the writing (different authors) fell flat. I really wanted to finish this book..and had to recheck it out of the library several times before I could finish it. Maybe the problem was that there were different authors, and not just one author with a vision. While this works with other authors, like those that collaborated on the Naked Came the Manatee novel, it didn't for these. I would recommend that if you are so moved to read it, make sure you get it from your local library."
2,A good idea that just doesn't pan out,"A so-so short story collection that is loosely tied together with a charm that crops up in each story. The voices, pacing, themes are really too disparate to make this anything more than an intro to some of the authors or just a plain short story collection. Wasn't interesting enough to propel me through it."
1,Tip a Penny,"There's a reason you can buy this book for a penny. Although the book concept was a good one (using a charm bracelet to bind the stories together), it didn't pan out. I didn't enjoy this book at all, and was positively disgusted by some of the stories."
4,Love the album... 1 star off for DVD,"This is a review about the CD + DVD version.... first off, this is my FAVORITE King Crimson album so 5 stars for that... the surround MIX is really nice... 5 stars for that too... my quibble is with 2 things... the Surround is an audio experience so naturally the image doesn't matter... the problem is leaving the discipline logo up for the length of the album will cause burn in on LCD and especially plasma monitors.. so I have to turn off the monitor when playing this DVD after I start it... which as many of you know often interferes with the HDMI signal to some receivers a bit so you get an annoying pause and miss a bit of the music... not exactly stellarAlso I would have loved to have a Blu Ray version of the 5.1 with 96khz uncompressed audio (as the Pink Floyd Immersion packages do) but do understand this is more cost effective and universal..."
1,"The CD skips, can I get a refund?","The copy of the CD ""Discipline,"" by King Crimson, which cost me $15, was defective and won't play beyond track 3 on my CD player. I thought Amazon exercised control over the quality of third-party vendors who sell on their site, but I was wrong. Is there any way I can get a good copy of the album or get a refund?Thank you,David"
5,Haven't heard anything else like it,"Whether you love or hate this album, there's nothing else like it in rock (or jazz or anything, for that matter) history. Incredibly disciplined; virtuoso playing--from four individuals, and virtuoso ensemble playing. Words will not describe what you'll hear: a unique guitar sound, poetic (if superficial and facetious) lyrics, a strange '80s sensibility. Wow!"
3,OK - Just OK,"I am a little disappointed by this DVD. Maritza is too self-absorbed, difficult to understand due to a thick accent and she uses terms and phrases that she does not define and that are not easily understandable. She also suffers from the type of ""specialness"" that is not atypical of the type of people who think they're better than the rest of us because they're spiritual. I find that Maritza's unlikeability detracts from the experience."
5,Excellent,"I popped Maritza's DVD in afterAM & PM Stretch, thinking I'd do Jillian Michael'sJillian Michaels - 30 Day Shredafterward. Oh my. Why?The first part, the yoga section, is unlike other yoga routines I've done. Martiza's instruction is very inward based and her choice of words takes you to different places with the poses, changing them from a purely physical move to something more in your head. I liked it!The second part, the body imaging section--whoa. I've actually done this before, in a different style without realizing it was a type of meditation in order to help get myself to sleep. Instead, I ended up so relaxed on the floor (not asleep, quite) that I did the rest of the DVD in the same position.After the third section of the DVD, I was so relaxed I was a noodle. Seriously noodle-like. I know I hadn't fallen asleep because when I wake up, I'm never that relaxed. Clearly I have more work to do with meditation with focusing my mind.Highly recommend this DVD."
3,ok for beginners..,"i like the mixture of just mediation sessions and sessions with stretch/yoga movement.. though the stretch/yoga sessions tend to move too fast. i kept having to pause, and watch again. i think with few more practices i wont have to concentrate too hard on the instructions."
5,Great body scan,"Ever done a body scan in a yoga class? In this gentle meditation, you become aware of how you are feeling, part by part. You might spend minutes becoming aware of the tops of your feet, whether warm, cool, tense or relaxed. As you go over your entire body from toe to head, it's hard not to gain a sense of peace and gratitude for living.Maintaining concentration throughout the exercise is another matter. It's really helpful to have someone guide you through it, periodically calling your attention perhaps back from the brink of sleep to move on to another part of your body. Maritza's body scan is excellent---to me the DVD is worth the price just for that. Her voice is gentle and unintrusive; and her questions insightful. The beach-side setting is appropriately tranquil. The yoga and seated meditation are nice, too. The DVD costs the same as a single yoga class. I've already played it several times and look forward to using it for years to come. An excellent value."
5,"If you really want to meditate, this is it!","I read the 3 star reviews and I think they were very unfair. The point they miss is that she is the best teacher of meditation I have ever experienced and I have tried many---both classes and DVD's. Her accent does not interfere with her abilities at all. Nor is she self-absorbed---those reviewers really have missed a gem.I love Rodney Yee's AM yoga, but his DVD's on meditation show he does not get it and she does.I wish she would do more.If you really want to meditate---really, really---no one is better."
4,Great Meditation DVD,This is a great dvd for meditation. The dvd is organized well and you can get right to the part you want easily. Her voice is pleasant and calming. I have several meditation dvd's and I think this is one of the best
4,I like it,this dvd is good for beginners that have a lot of chatter in their heads like myself. She helps you to quiet the mind.
4,STOP! and breathe...,i actually bought this for my sister because of the description of the dvd - i took a relaxation class two semesters ago and much of what we did in class (which was very helpful) sounded like what this dvd goes over. my sister hasn't used it yet - so i can't give a detailed review...but it sounds like a great dvd for beginners. (and if you're one of those people who thinks 'it sound too hard' or you've tried to meditate only a few times and say 'it's too hard' - it gets easier! meditation IS hard! at first...it takes time to learn to settle your mind...but once you keep at it and LEARN...it's the best thing EVER!)
1,Buyer beware,"Any benefits from the meditation is highly compromised EVERY time you start the DVD. First, there are several cover-their-butts warnings. Then there is the LONG commercial for the publisher, GAIAM Media. I repeat, every time you start the DVD. Every stinkin' time. EVERY, every, every time. Did I say, EVERY time.So you want a nice meditation session. Wonderful. Great. But let me first shove an in-your-face corporate commercial down your throat, whether you want it or not. You know, because we can. And becasue, of course, we are more important than you.To me, this makes the whole premise a lie. People want meditation to get away from the busy-ness of the world, which of course, primarily consists of heavy doses of corporate crap we are CONSTANTLY fed. Margarine anyone?Boycott it, dont buy it."
5,An impressive program,"I had never experienced meditation before, but read an article that stated individuals who practiced meditation received many beneficial results, including improved memory as well as reduced stress. With my job, I receive PLENTY of stress, so I thought I would give this program a try.I was AMAZED at how well the techniques taught in this video worked for me. I've noticed an immediate difference in the amount of stress I felt. I also sleep much more sound and awake refreshed.If stress is an issue for you, then you will find this video a great tool for stress relief."
3,Too abstract and detached for me....,"I ordered this on the strength of all the great recommendations here. Your mileage may vary but this simply didn't draw me in, and i doubt that I'll view it again after my first viewing. Way too much intro material and GAIAM advertising, you can see the waves but not hear them (which I would have found soothing), and I found the instructor's French accent and frequent mispronunciations distracting instead of charming. I was hoping for something a little more down to earth...this was too abstract and detached for distractible, stressed-out me."
4,"Simple, yet effective for the beginner","I have been doing yoga for 18 years, so I am familiar with the poses on this DVD. However, Maritza's choice of specific postures (many focused on the spine which is my problem area) are very effective at promoting relaxation and are non strenuous. I find myself doing her routine more often than my other yoga exercises these days. I have also been doing body scan meditation and mindfulness practice for years(not regularly as I should) but I find I am more likely to follow through with her routine and instructions as they are simple and to the point. I also find her voice calming. I think this is a good DVD for anyone interested in beginning meditation and it works for those of us who also have some experience with the subject but might lack the proper motivation : )"
5,Wonderful!,"I loved this! The exercises warm up and ground your muscles, and the meditations are really wonderful. I found them to be the perfect kind of challenge, and a lot of my body pain that I have been experiencing went away after I was finished. Highly recommended."
5,Powerful!,This is one of the most powerful meditation CDs. Fully guides you and I've had incredible results.
3,If you like 20th century Spain....,"...you will like this book. Otherwise, be wary. I had to read it for my Western Civilization class, it wasn't the worst book my teacher could have picked. I did like how it discussed the Misiones Pedagogicas and their libraries and traveling theaters. What really hurt me is the constant use of spanish words. They would only be defined in english once, and there were so many that I couldn't remember them all. There is also a lot of information about the Spainsh Civil War. I liked how the war was put in context of the culture they were trying to create. So, if you like Spain and esp. if you know Spanish, this will be a great book."
1,Only if you've run out of other 3 stooges,This DVD by Good Times Home Video has a lot of the same material as in The Three Stooges: Kings of Laughter by the same company. They really shouldn't have tried to cheat customers by doing this.It is really only for the hardcore 3 stooges fans who have seen absolutely everything else by them. Much of it is pretty sad--only a little bit funny--stuff with recycled routines from earlier moves/shorts. These shorts lack the inspired craziness of some of the earlier movies/shorts had.Look elsewhere for your 3 stooges fix.
2,"The Three Stooges, Funniest Moments",I am a Three Stooges fan but this version didn't even make me snicker. It seems the funny has gone out of them.
1,Poor How to Book,"This book is an historical overview of the subject. However, in my estimation, it is a poor how-to guide on the subject. There aren't a lot of visuals demonstrating techniques. Just a lot of printed text describing the history of the genre. I am disappointed in this book and wouldn't recommend it for someone who is looking for how-to info."
5,Best pen and ink book available on the market today.,I teach at the local art league. I reference this book to all my students and recommend that they buy it. There isn't a better book on the market today. Pen and ink goes back a long way in history and the older techniques still hold true for those individuals wanting to learn to draw in pen and ink today. I highly recommend the book.Scott L. Hendriescottlhendrie.com
4,Not much has changed since 1930,Ink and pen was pretty much perfected around the turn of the century and the benefit of that expertise is captured quite well in this book. You still get the best and most expressive lines from a steel pen. This seems like a perfect book for a beginner or an experienced artist interested in all the nuances of the pen.My only real issue with the book is it seems to be focused heavily on architectural themes and technical issues and less on art. So I give it 4 stars.
5,Best ink book ever.,This book is wonderful. I have looked for a good ink book for quite a while. I'm looking no longer. This book is the real deal.
4,Good buy,"I have an older version of this seat and a couple of the high back versions of this model. I think this seat is great IF your child really only requires the extra height the seat provides but does not need the belt positioning clip to keep the shoulder belt properly positioned. The tethered clip used to keep the shoulder strap properly positioned must be re-checked an likely moved every time you use the seat.As an alternative, I'd highly recommend the high back Turbo Booster, which has a ring shaped belt guide built into the back. This allows the child to move a little more freely and get in and out of the car without dislodging the clip. When the child is taller and no longer requires the guide, you can remove the back and have the equivalent of this seat."
5,Son loves it!,"We just got this, and my son LOVES the freedom he now has in the seat. We are going to buy another one for the other car and nana'a truck too. ONCE AGAIN, I have to reiterate what other parents have said - you have to be intelligent enough to know how this seat is meant to be used in your vehicle, and you have to make sure you have good working seatbelts. LOVE IT!"
5,EXCELLENT SEAT -- MY GIRLS LOVE IT!,I bought two of these for my two girls. The seat is very easy to put into and out of the car especially if you have mulitple cars and need to switch often. Love it when we go to Nana's to sleep over and can take the seat out in a flash. The girls feel independent because they can buckle their seatbealts like mommy. They sit raised up and securely in their seats. The cupholder is a bonus!
1,please do not purchase this product,"My 41/2 year old 42 pound daughter was using this product when the car she was riding in was involved in a head on collision. My daughter suffered serious internal injuries and a broken back. As a result of the accident, sh is now a parapalegic. Since this device is little more than something to allow her to be the right height to wear a seatbelt, it offered no back support on impact. I believe had she been in a traditional car seat with the clips across her chest she wouldn't have been as injured as she was. Parents please use caution, dont let the price make this decision for you."
3,Helpful Information,"As a pastor in transition, I found this book somewhat helpful. It was good to hear other people's stories. The main thing I did not like about this book, however, is that it was pretty boring. While statistical information can be helpful, I found the analysis pretty dry. Personally, I learn a lot from anecdotes (and also find them more interesting to read!), so if you're looking for a good read, this is not it. But if you are a pastor in transition, it may be helpful for you. Also, the 5 denominations the authors looked at were: Assemblies of God, ELCA, Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, Presbyterian Church USA, and UMC. I am not in one of those 5 - I am UCC - so some of the information was relevant, but not all of it."
4,Pastoral Perspective,"Pastors in Transition: Why Clergy Leave Local Church Ministry-is an excellent and accurate assessment of the prevailing pressures exerting itself on pastors in churches of all sizes and denominations here in the US. I work for a ministry that specializes in ministering to pastors and I have found that the data and narrative set forward in this book, accurately reflects what we hear first hand from the pastors who come through our ministry.If you are looking for a book that was written with great care so as to reflect accurately the current state of pastors here in the United States, this is a book that you will want to read."
2,uninspiring at best,"I didnt care for this album but I have bought worse. It might be a good ""cool down from a trip"" disc but it does not have any memorable moments to make me want to listen to it over and over. It is the typical droning fodder that gradually evolves from one beat to the next but never really goes anywhere. Track 12 is down right annoying.The other reviewers tout the ""tribal"" beats which are what I anticipated in the album's title. They just are not there and I dont have any idea what they are talking about."
3,The Vocals Are What Hinder This Album,"This is the first volume of Dark Drums that I've listened to. I am tracking down a lot of Steve Lawler's older releases as I love the genre of electronica that he tends to play. Picking up where Danny Tenaglia left off. Tribal House (albeit, Lawler likes the darker tones).I was excited when I first listened to this album as the first couple of tracks were exactly what I was hoping the whole set would sound like. Unfortunately, Lawler chose to mix mostly tracks with vocals. I have no problem with vocals, but with Tribal House they can't be so overly dominating that they even drown out the all-essential drums (it is Dark Drums after all, right?)! This occurs for the majority of the remaining tracks. Couple this with the vocals' lyrics frequently being cheesy, and album becomes much less enjoyable for this reviewer despite its excellent tribal drum loops.3.5/5 stars"
2,FYI: Warning note on product packaging,"The product packaging indicates ""WARNING: This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm."" I suppose this would not be an issue for those who wear gloves while riding.I am disappointed this warning was not included with the product description on the Amazon website. The grips were returned with shipping at my expense ($3)."
2,Doesn't help with wrist pain,I bought this because I thought after several years my old foam grips must have given out since I have such a problem with wrist pain and numbness when I commute home on my bike. But these didn't help any and were no improvement over my 10 year old grips.
1,WTF,This is not hip hop. There is a lot of great Latino Hip Hop. Kid Frost should be going crazy being on this album. Carlos Ponce and Carlos Vives ? What the heck were these guys smoking when they put this together ?
5,"Clowns and Drag Queens and Preachers, OH MY!","Escape From Houdini Mountain is a dizzing joyride of autobiographical fiction from a different kind of L.A. Woman. Spun from her experiences in the L.A. underground, the stories are infectiously entertaining. Pleasant's eye for the human condition is pristine. Her heart shines as she revels in a carnival of delicately drawn characters. Some are sad, some sick, some brilliant, but in Pleasant's world they are all appreciated equally. Ultimately this book, for all it's wildly funny tales, is an evolved praising of feminine beauty and it's power in a world gone mad."
2,Light Hearted Banter,This was a fast easy read. The best excerpt in the entire collage was the very first 'kindergarten' tale. It was a so-so book and okay for a switch from my regular choice of authors.
2,Broken inside,Imagine to a childs disappointment when the toy you have been waiting for has a broken piece inside....that was my kid. He took it well.
2,Unisex? For who?,"This watch is pretty, well made, heavy and HUGE. I bought it for my wife, who is 5'10"", and it looks like some kind of novelty gag on her wrist. It's more cumbersome to wear than any watch I own, and I'm not a small guy. Sorry Nike, but a pair of wrist weights would be a more appropriate athletic accessory."
4,the best I've come across,"The best of club mix is by far the best dance compilation I've found so far. Covering late 80's to 99, it pretty much hits most of the big dance tracks of the past decade.""You're not alone"" by Olive is included in a seven minute mix that is flat out awesome. This is worth checking out!"
4,LOUDER THAN EVER but...,"This is a great album with big names like xzibit, three6mafia, beatnuts and more. The only bad thing is that the most songs have come out earlier on other cd's. But for the people who don't care about compilations it's a good album."
4,My Secret Feelings,"I love this series. I love the way it shows you how it was in the past. This book is with my top three. It has the three things a book needs; romance, history, and just a touch of tragedy. It is great how Madeline gets involved and how she incurages other kids to also. She might have trouble dealing with her pain but her friends and family help her through that."
3,Alicia's Review,"This was my first time reading a diary form of book, so at first it was a litte confusing. Mary Pope Osborne did a great detailed job of writing this book. My Secret War takes place in 1941, Long Island, New York. Madeline Beck writes in her diary about her father and a boy named Jonny who she ""LOVES."" Also, she talks about the bullies in her class. Her father is gone and is in the middle of the war, then one early moring her mother and her heard over the radio that the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. What will happen next? Read the book and find out!!"
5,One of the best Dear America books!,"I loved this book it is kinda scary though , I literaly could not put this book down I stayed up till 11:33 p.m. reading it it is about Madeline Beck a 13 year old girl who lives in a boarding house in Long Island ,New York, she meets a boy named jonny they start out friends and turn out to be boyfriend and girlfriend,they discover nazis on the beach and call the FBI it is great in the end if you read it I'm sure you'll love it!"
4,My Secret War,This is a pretty good book-but it was not as good as it could have been. It just wasn't one of those books that you can't put down.-Caiti
5,My Secret War is wonderful!!,"My Secret War is about a girl named Madeline but known as Maddie from friends. Madeline is a young girl who befriends a Clara, a Jewish and German immigrant, Theo, Clara's lover, and Johnny, her boyfriend or just pals. Maddie's father went to World War 2 to battle against the Germans (Nazis), and the Japanese. Maddie joins this club with Johnny and investigates shocking things about the Japanese and the Nazis and tries to help America win World War 2. But when her father had been wounded Maddie's life turned up-side-down so she quit the club and being lonely in her dark,lonesome room, thinking. And she later just moves on with her life. I highly recommend you to read this book. Mrs. Osborne has done a wonderful job on this book."
5,Great Book,This book is a great book.It's about A girl named MadelineBeck. Her dad is in army.She lives with people she never knew.She trys has hard as she can to be a Star Point.Then she Starts Awar club.Then she starts to Become famous andstarts to fall in love.Can she fall in love and Try to be calm when her dad is in the hospital?You'll find out when you read this book. This is 1of my favorite Dear America Books.
2,My Secret War----review,"I'm in the midst of a WWII obsession, and I picked up My Secret War after having eyed it a few times in passing at the bookstore. It was not as good as I had hoped it would be, though decent enough for a children's story. The plot seemed a bit unlikely, with Maddie and Johnny discovering Nazi saboteurs (as well as the Star Points, a group that seems to appear in most childrens' books in various forms), and the diary's subject matter seemed too trivial for a thirteen-year-old in the midst of a war. That's the main point of my complaints--the entries seem too forced. The writing does not seem to be realistic, more like an adult trying to sound like a child. Perhaps the author is too far away from childhood, or perhaps I'm too demanding of ""perfect fiction."" However, it was better than some books I've read, and the actual history was intriguing."
4,Perfect for WWII unit study,I let my children read these types of books for our unit studies. They bring them into history quite well.
5,Maddie's hardships,"Maddie Beck lives in a boarding house with her mother,while her dad is ststioned in the Pacific. It is hard for her to make friends at school untill her crush Johnny Vecchio and her make a club that colects things that soldiers need.One night when Maddie couldn't sleep she took a walk on the beach and believes she met up with some Nazi's and called the FBI. One day Maddie gets a letter from a nurse saying that her fauther was critically wounded. Everyone started writing letters to her dad. A little while later they had to move to San Fransico where he is being hospitalized."
3,Not Worth It,"It misses the Caribbean and Florida. When they go to Thailand they only show you caves and in Hawaii all you see is someone canoeing. It also visits Brazil, Greek Islands, Fiji, India, & Africa. Specidal features: Best Diving, Surfing, and Beach Huts. They also show you the cheap hotels they stay in."
2,Definite problem here...,"...and that problem is that one person's Eno ""Desert Island Selection"" isn't going to be another's! Brian Eno is just too multi-faceted to pin down to a single CD, really, and even as an introduction this fails, as there's certain whole albums that do a better job than a compilation ever could. Originally intended as a companion CD for the ""More Dark than Shark"" lyrics/art book collaboration with painter Russell Mills."
3,"good , but...","I dislike ""best of"" collections for this very reason..what is one's best, anyhow?Perhaps some artists you can get away with making such a cd for, but Eno isn't one to do this to...if you prefer Eno's more uptempo vocal material, then this cd isn't for you...if you like Eno's 80's material, you are out of luck.For me personally I have no problems with the tracks chosen for this 70's collection, but that's why the 2 ""Eno Box"" sets were made years back- so that everyone could get what they wanted.Its a good primer, I suppose, but buy the lps instead."
1,Where's the ambience?,"If you've heard of Eno and are thinking of getting one of his albums, be forewarned: this is not the ambient glory that I had expected. Sure I should have done some better research, but I made the mistake. You shouldn't. The songs are mostly quite awful, as Eno's vocals practically ruin every song... sorry to be so negative, but I was severely disapointed..."
1,"Weak,Boring&funny",i don't know who is more dryer Yanni or John Tesh? both Equally weak&boring.this video is good for a Nap to.his music is Lifeless and Lame.he bops his head like he has a Groove going on? that's the funny part.
5,Yanni's the Greatest,Tribute is one of the Best Concerts Ever. Yanni is the best musician ever and his Tribute album is GOLD. Some of the best pieces of music that Yanni has created are in this album. Performing this great music in front of the Magical Taj Mahal and Forbidden City makes it an unforgetable EVENT
3,Not bad quality,"Sound quality settings is more analog then digital. Not bad for the time it has been recorded. Overall, if you're a Yanni fan- you'll love it regardless."
5,A masterpiece indeed,"What more i can say, about Yanni. He is simply the master of instrumental music. All the cultures mixed in a magical blend of sounds. Taj Mahal, India and the Forbidden City at China. Another great concert for your collection."
5,GREAT & EXCEPTIONAL PERFORMANCE !!!!!,"This Concert is the best performance of Yanni. This DVD, have an exceptional quality of image and sound. The musicians are very professional. The idea to play beside ""The Taj-Majal"" and ""Forbidden City"", was Great!!!.It's the best concert in DVD in the last years."
1,Technical issue with a marvelous concert,"This is my third update of this particular album (VHS, CD, DVD) and though most of Yanni's work leaves me yawning, the Tribute album ranks in my top five ATF's. And the venues are gorgeous! (The Taj Mahal, and The Forbidden City.) But the bass is so amplified on this DVD that I wonder if this a bootleg copy. This is the only CD or DVD in my entire collection that I find it neccessary to turn max down the bass."
1,Item never received,"I never received this item. What else can I say? I don't have time to chase people for little things like this so I'll let my review do the talking.Bad seller, dishonest, cheat!"
5,Yanni - Tribute,...the music is outstanding...its even better to watch it actually being performed. Each member of his orchestra seems to be the best at whatever instrument they play.
5,Outstanding Artist and Concert,"Yanni is by far, one of the greatest musical artists of all times. His natural talent and development of a unique style of music is refreshing to listen to and his concerts are world class. I never get tired of listening to his music and watching his concets on DVD. They are soothing for relaxing at the end of a stressful day."
5,Soothing and regenerating to the soul,"Even those who are generally not moved by music will love this video. It is filled with energy! Yanni so obviously loves his music, and his spirit flows through his orchestra which is composed of talent from all over the world! One of the few music videos I would ever buy, or watch again and again. The music crosses the lines of ages and style. END"
4,Swashbuckling! Cool! A ton of fun! Woo Who!!,"They won't be in the hall of fame but this is toe-tapping, fast car driving, great fun. Check out disc two and forget the Ramones and Dr. Feelgood. This is the real deal."
3,Remaster Disaster,"What on eathbound happened here. First off I will start by saying that I'm a big fan of K.C. Every incarnation included. Excellent musicians. Fantastic compositions. But something went horribly wrong during the remastering process of this release. Apparently this was remasterd by Fripp and Tony Arnold. Let's get to the point. There is a very obvious lack of bottom end on this release. It sounds very thin. Being a pro musician with many hours of studio time under my belt I feel that I have enough experienece to know that what I'm saying / hearing is accurate. If you want these tunes on C.D. I suggest to get them on a different release. They are available on numerous other compilations and on the original versions of the albums from which they were culled. The musicians, compositions and performances get 5 stars but the remaster problems allows for 1 star. Thus 3 Stars for this problematic C.D."
3,Looking for something different ? Try this one !,"I came across this CD & thought it was worth a listen. They have various top notch players in an avant garde setting.Thought that this was going to be different.That in itself doesn't always make for good music. But in this case, it works.I really like the tracks: Discipline, Matte Kudasai, Elephant Talk,Sleepless, Frame by Frame. These tracks are outstanding!By chance, it turns out that one of my favourite bass players appers on those tracks. To me, the band sounds smoother & funkier with him on bass/stick.That's Tony Levin, who you may recognize from Peter Gabriel.The Greg Lake (original band)is here. 21st Century Schiziod Man, Epitaph, The Court of the Crimson King.Plenty of futuristic sounding music.The potential pitfall of creating in this style, is not to be so self indulgent, that the listener ends up bored or lost.This music is very listenable.It is worthwhile, for a sampling of King Crimson."
5,a MANS review,"EDIT: This is a reposting of my initial review because for some reason (as I have stated in my comment) Amazon saw fit to add the title ""A Kid's Review"" to my review. I have no idea why this is so. I am not a kid. I am a 40 year old male. With that in mind...For starters I must say I am a man. I am a crossdresser. With that in mind you might know that men are the largest purchasers of pantyhose in the world. So - I have tried many a pair. I have to say that these pantyhose are by far the most comfortable, sexy, and best bang-for-your-buck hose I've ever worn. If you've never tried them you should. I will always return to this style in ever color (depending upon the season).I give hanes silk reflections transparent sheer to waist pantyhose the highest rating. I would give it a higher rating if it were available."
4,Renewing an old acquaintance,"I first read ""The Pursuit of Love"" many years ago, but the humorous escapades of Fa and the Bolter have always remained in my mind. Reminded of the Mitford family by the recent publication of the sisters' letters, I reread ""The Pursuit of Love."" I found it as thoroughly entertaining as I found it the first time. And reading ""Love in a Cold Climate"" was another enjoyable experience as I wanted to know more about this zany extended family.Watching the current PBS ""Complete Jane Austen"" series, I find it amusing how many things did not change among the English upper classes in the over 100 years between Jane Austen's novels and Nancy Mitford's novels.-- Phyllis Zimbler Miller"
4,The Pursuit of Love & Love in a Cold Climate,"I first read ""The Sisters"" about the Milford family which piqued my interest. These two books written by Nancy Milford were very enjoyable. You could definitely see which true-life persons she was basing her characters upon."
5,To the manor born,"Is Nancy Mitford likeable? Perhaps not, if her alter-ego, Linda Radlett, is anything to go by. Rarely are we asked to care about a character who despises children and judges others entirely by their clothing. However, The Pursuit of Love is essential reading for two reasons: one, it gives an apparently unselfconscious portrait of the author; and two, it lays the foundation for your reward, Love in a Cold Climate. Almost entirely Linda-Free, this book focusses its laser beam on vanity, classism, and misguided sexuality. Much like the films of Spike Lee, it seems that Ms. Mitford's work is smarter than she is. But the Lecherous Lecturer gets the fate he deserves, and that covers a multitude of sins."
5,I bought this book to get Star Prince Charlie,"Reading the Hoka stories is like eating spinach - it's something you enjoy or you don't. For the most part I can pass on themI had ""Star Prince Charle"" in a fading-ink falling-apart paperback, and the opportunity to get it in hardcover at an affordable price was too good to pass up!"
5,Brillant! Jewell-like!,"Larry Dossey, M.D. writes: All truly great and enduring spiritual documents are jewellike -- luminously clear and radiant. That is because truth is simple and uncomplicated. Anyone who reads this book will have found a precious gem, a treasure of immense worth. This book is about the Great Constants -- those insights that have changed lives throughout human history."
1,Warmed-over hash with no new insights,"Why was this book published? A great title with absolutely nothing new to add...a total waste of money and paper. If you want an over-intellectualized, academic summary of east-west thinking that is presented arrogantly with NO soul, have at it. This guy kept putting off friends who wanted him to write a book and he finally gave in. He should have listened to himself! Dry, boring, useless."
1,Response to my bad review of this book,"Why would someone ""be sad"" and assume that a bad review means the reviewer isn't ""ready""? And then cite reviews published with the book by other authors who obviously all praise each other's works when they are published? Come on! Isn't that just a teensy bit arrogant?... Which is exactly one of my criticisms of the book!For instance, Pearce (whose books I love) writes the foreword, and then Pearce's books are praised by the author in his book.I'd be happy to match my ""spiritual credentials"" with yours any day, Mr/Ms Sad But Ready Wonderer, but that would make you even sadder and bore others reading this to tears..."
5,Glow in dark cards,These are pretty cool cards. So far we haven't had problems with the glow in the dark layer coming off and the plastic is durable.We have enjoyed playing with them.
1,Know ALL before you buy,"I just bought these cards and I'm very disapointed in the product. I was lookign for something different that could stand up to a lot including accidental spills that have ruined card games before. I found these cards, although a little pricey, I thought I would like them.These cards are thinner then most cards. The bow that they comes in is not the right size to hold all the cards. The glow is weak and shipping was one of the slowest I have ever seen for amazon. It took two two almost three weeks to just ship it off. Most amazon items ship the next couple of days at the most. Do not buy these cards unless you know exactly what you are getting. Do some research on plastic cards first, before you buy."
1,Come on people!,This movie straight up is really bad. I dont know why all these people are saying it is funny. It really isn't. It is a disgrace to the world of black cinima and in fact the african american community in general. Don't buy this movie.
1,no....no....no...no!,words can't even begin to explain how bad this movie is.this is without question one the top three worst movies ever made.cosby should've been banned from making movies after this mess.shame-shame
4,Ghost Dad is funny!,"Ghost Dad stars Bill Cosby as a workaholic father who is never at home and leaves all of his reponsibilities to his oldest daughter. His oldest daughter begins to resent him when he forgets her birthday. That day also changes Bill's character life forever when a crazed taxi driver picks him up and runs off the bridge causing him to become a ghost. Bill is forced to be at the mercy of his children who help him darken his office at work, so he can be seen. As the movie progresses, Bill's character becomes closer to his children and learns that he needs to make more time for them. This movie has a lot of Bill Cosby's humor, which is really funny at times. One of the funniest scenes is with Bill and a guy in England who calls himself ""Ed-ith"", instead of ""E-dith."" Definitely see this movie if you like Bill Cosby."
3,Love the movie...Some problems with the DVD,"First I will start by saying that I love this movie. I was excited to get it on DVD. The thing that left me perplexed was how scenes were deleted from the DVD. I was disappointed by that. They added a few scenes, but I felt the gap when a part I knew well was skipped. I'm not sure what I feel about that."
3,A Little Out of Character for Bill Cosby,The movie was a little out of character for Bill Cosby. He is a great actor as usual but they often took Jesus's name in vain which was offensive.
5,Mandarin Orange Patchouli Bliss,"If there is one conditioner that impressed me in 2006, it is the Nature's Gate Organics Fruit Blend Conditioner with Mandarin Orange & Patchouli. Every shower experience is subtly enhanced with a warm fragrance and slightly more than intoxicating essential oil mood.This is one conditioner you will miss if you happen to use it all up too fast. The ingredients in this conditioner are especially interesting. Rose Geranium, Lavender, Lychee fruit, Persimmon, Mallow, Hops, Birch, French Roses, Aloe, Marshmallow Root, Horsetail, Wheat Protein and Jojoba Oil create a highly moisturizing and healing experience.If you want a deeper conditioning, warm some olive oil to a pleasant temperature and blend in an equal amount of this conditioner. I was amazed at how glossy my hair was after this experience. So, this makes a perfect base for a deep conditioning experience or can be used as a daily indulgence.~The Rebecca Review"
1,One size DOES NOT fit all.,Described as one size fits all. Well... no! Not a chance for me to wear it. Not an adult size. Fits my 3-year-old grandson tough.
1,Too tight!,"I got a large and it doesn't fit at all. If I force my head in there I would probably cut circulation off to my brain and pass out. Does not look good either. On another note, item delivered on time."
3,Picks on Beatles,"I was very dissapointed, this was not Chet Atkins at his best .The drums and other instruments were not what I expectedI wanted to hear good guitar music not some band."
5,Chet Adkins picks on the Beatles,I enjoy Beatles music & I love a great guitar. This has both. Very well done & easy to listen to!
4,Best Stooge documentary on dvd,"I own the A and E biography on Stooges and that is a great video, but its not released on dvd. This was a excellent documentary and I cant see how people can complain about it. The only problem I have was some of the timeline was out of place, but thats small details. Larry's last interview is a bit hard to watch, being a die hard Stooge fan. The dvd is a great, cheap pick up on Stooge history."
2,Cheaply made documentary,"...This DVD is a collection of recycled stooge interview/movie/short clips with an original narrative track. There is NO original footage. Often, old film clips that have nothing to do with the stooges are inserted as filler material. In fact, the actual stooge clips they do use are repeated as many as 5 times.Audio quality also leaves a lot to be desired. The narrator sounds as though he's reading from inside a public restroom.I've bought several stooge DVDs...They're ALL cheap, repetitive and have poorly designed menus.The only reason this DVD rates 2 stars is because it does contain some interesting information for those who are not already up on Stooge history."
4,FABULOUS - Two Thumbs up for Monica Frazier Anderson,"""When a Sisah's Fed Up"" is a great book. I was surprised this was Monica Anderson's first novel. As a avid reader, I love to read novels that keep you wanting more. This book falls in that category. It is a ""page turner"" from beginning to end. The characters come to life. Everyone who reads this book will be able to relate to it in one aspect or another. I read it at every possible opportunity until I was finished. I can't wait for the next novel from this author. Congratulations on a job well done."
2,A poorly supported argument,"The author had some interesting ideas, but is far from convincing. I find many of his statistics doubtful. The author sites a study performed by Shere Hite that was so poorly done, many introductory statistics texts give it as an example of what not to do in a study. The author has frightful real-life examples in each chapter, but these are not supporting his arguments. The worst example of this is the rape chapter. The author argues that rape is mainly about procreation, but gives examples of men raping then killing women and women who are sexually tortured, but with whom the men do not copulate.I feel that the author presents some valuable ideas and theories, but that the author's supporting evidence is highly suspect. This is more likely due to the author's lack of statistical knowledge than to any deliberate missinformation."
3,A rather grim look at the effects of original sin,"The book is a graphic exploration of violence in humans--especially men--and other primates, with a chapter each devoted to the subjects of rape, murder, warfare, and genocide. Because the book is completely secular, the author does not consider the possibility of original sin as a cause for all of this, but still the book provides ample descriptions of the effects of original sin. I am not an anthropologist, so I cannot comment on the strength or weakness of his anthropological arguments, but his view is clearly that the purpose of life is ""to live long enough to procreate before you become food for somebody else"" (to quote Calvin and Hobbes). If there is no eternal life as taught by Christianity, then life is indeed as grim and meaningless as he has described; if there is, however, it literally makes all the difference in the world."
4,"Loved Rodney, Patricia is so-so...","The morning workout instructed by Rodney Yee is terrific-- a gentle, brief routine to do first thing in the morning. I found it an excellent beginner's DVD. Like Rodney says, the benefits seemed small at first, but you really do find it makes a difference. The P.M. segment is okay, though I found the poses a bit more advanced for a beginner!"
3,"AM deserves 5 stars, perhaps not PM","Like other folks here have said - for a beginner the PM segment of this DVD is aimed a little higher than most of us can achieve at first. (The first time I tried the PM, I remarked that it would be a happy day for me when I am flexible enough to put my head on or anywhere NEAR my shin in a seated position). That said, I have been doing the AM yoga practice with Rodney Yee for months now, and it is a great introduction for someone who is completely new to yoga. He introduces the poses slowly and it is a gentle workout that will invigorate but not exhaust. There are no times when you should feel you are scrambling to keep up with him, which is not the case with the PM. It's also difficult to do the necessary modified poses if you didn't shell out for a yoga brick, strap, etc. That's another good thing about the AM pose - the belt from a housecoat or something equivalent works just as well for the one equipment assisted pose that's included."
2,OK for beginners,"I am an exercise enthusiast but have never done Yoga. I got this, thinking it would be a good introduction but it is too simple (or maybe I'm just too simple minded). The poses are not very challenging, however I do feel more ""loose"" after doing this."
1,"False picture for selling product Amazon, (not Eco Labs)","Microbe lift PL is excellent for your water garden, but do not order from Amazon's picture.The picture shows an all season kit which includes a full season's bacterial needs at a discounted price.Each kit contains 1 each:*Spring/Summer Cleaner*PL (Water Clarifier)*TheraP (for fish health)*Autumn/Winter Prep[...]Amazon, however is selling you one gallon of PL....This is not what I wanted nor is it what I expected. A picture is worth a thousand words, but reading the description and not being in a hurry will save you sixty bucks.Very disappointed with Amazon (for the first time)."
5,"Great ""insurance"" for a healthy pond!!!","Good stuff. Yes, it does have a foul odor, but MicrobeLift PL works and it will really speed up the ""cycle"" on your new pond and create a balanced, healthy pond as well. I use it every spring to ""kick start"" the bio-filter as the pond water wakes up during the spring season. I've never had any sick fish, but I use PL as kind of an insurance for the health of my koi and goldfish. Catch it on sale every spring and it really isn't that expensive if it helps keep your fish healthy long term. I have peace of mind knowing that I'm doing everything that I can to keep my water crystal clear and maintain top notch water quality."
4,Pond Algae control,We have been looking for algae control for our koi pond for years. We use a small filtering system and have tried many products. We started using Microbe-Lift PL in April of this year. The product has for the most part controlled the algae without affecting the fish. There remains a thin layer of algae on the surface of the pond but the rest of the water remains clear. Note that along with the filter and Microbe-Lift we incorporate blue pond dye and have numerous water plants. We will continue to purchase this product until something better comes along.
4,"Not life changing, but--","I think I bought this album with my expectations way too high. After reading the 18th review that gushed hyperboles like ""oh my god it made me cry"" and ""best album of the year!!"" I more or less took their advice and ran out of my house to buy it immediately. I admit I was disappointed at first, but on subsequent listens, at varying volume levels and various states of sobriety, the album began to grow on me. Overall I see a slightly more lyrical and playful, less hip-hop influenced BOARDS OF CANADA that isn't afraid of 8 min long tracks that are more like miniature movements of varying interpretations or stages of an organizing theme. While the album has it's moments--""Smell Memory,"" and the beautiful, woozy ""Asleep/Awake on a Train""--I definitely encourage anyone who hasn't heard BOARDS to try their stuff, especially the ""A Beautiful Place Out in the Country"" EP. More than anything else MUM show a lot of potential and I'm excited to see what they do next.."
3,"quaint, homespun electronic songs","mum's mysterious world revolves around childlike melodies and tranquil, haunting homespun electronica. there are some very beautiful moments gathered within these songs that reflect a sense of childhood memories and innocence. although this is a good cd, it's not something that i find myself listening to all that much. it has it's moments and for what it is...it's nice. recommended for fans of Plone."
4,Helping Hands,A family book of well meaning parents who may not see the obvious. The heroine enjoys something but her parents keep pushing in another direction. Her brothers are brothers but finally have the sensible solution. An enjoyable story with a conclusion a young child may not only appreciate but also speculate on what happens next? Many children will associate with the situation in the story as well as thinking about themselves. The ending is a nice message.
4,Sigh for a Merlin,"To anyone interested in the history of both the Spitfire and the magnificent engine that powered it, this is a top read. A well-written memoir, it retains the interest from first page to last. Highly recommend it."
2,Average MF,"Bought it at a local store (BB). This is a bit bulky but BW printing and scanning/copying is very good and fast.Color Photo print quality is just disappointing. coloring and shades are horrible and little blurry. I had other printers too but this printer is way below than Epson,HP and even Brother for photo printing. After printing 10 test letter size photots (Canon Glossy paper), I could not withstand and just promptly returned. So I do not recommend this printer if you want any glossy photo printing."
4,Good Printer for the Money,"Color shading on prints is somewhat different than what appears on my computer or camera but I have not yet tried playing around with the printer settings, which may improve the situation. Extremely easy to use and set up. Lot's of cool features (print directly from camera, use SD card as a hard drive, direct print from SD card, etc.), which I haven't used yet. Good software bundle. Works as advertised."
2,below par with previous canon printers,"This canon is not as good as the canon printers I owned. I have a $40 Canon IP1500 which prints better pictures. What's wrong with my printer: 1)You copy faces from magazines and the face color in the output is yellow instead of brown. 2) Scan a picture and its quality sucks-very strong yellows 3) the blacks are extremely and they come out washed out ang grayish 4) copying and scanning is extremely slow 5) easy photoprint is a horrible software, you could not even change the printer properties from here. The good: At least it is better than PSC1610 which I returned."
1,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT!,"I was extremely disappointed in this purchase. It turned out to be a refurbished model that did not work! [There was no indication beforehand that it was not a brand new item.] I had to pay UPS to send it back. THEN, I only received a partial refund for the returned item.It cost me a bundle to learn not to buy anything from Amazon again!"
4,Expensive ink.....,I got this printer to replace an Epson that just took too dern long to warm up and print a page. It was taking forever....This is not much better. Still a lot of ink charging and jyrating before I get a page. The color seems to be good but not that much more remarkable than the old slow Epson. No off market ink cartridges for this model so far which makes it $$$$ to operate. Next printer I'll check the ink situation before buying.
1,disappointed and frustrated with this printer!,"Bought this about 1 1/2 years ago and wish I didn't. Almost immediately I had problems with the print quality, then it suddenly stopped working altogether. The closest repair facility is over an hour away in another state so I called tech support. The guy was friendly and we tried a bunch of things that didn't work. He sent me a ""new"" printer for free and I sent mine back in the box the new one came in. Turns out the ""new"" one didn't work (after a couple hours of trying to figure out what I did wrong I finally realized it wasn't me).So I returned that one for #2. That one lasted two days and stopped working too! So I gave up. I bought a different brand and won't buy a Canon again. Thought they had a good reputation but there are many other brands out there. Keep looking!"
3,"For the price, not bad",The MP450 works well for the price and occasional use. It goes through ink fairly quickly so I use it mostly for copying. The black and white copies come out nice but for scanning it's just average. It's easy to use.
5,beautiful,"This is a lovely little book for any cowboy. Or anyone interested in the west, or just plain spiritual; it is easy to read and inspirational."
5,the most amazing live cd I have ever heard.,This is the greatest live recording I have ever heard. I had the privilege of being at the actual recording and it was the best show I have ever seen.A MUST HAVE.
4,"Rare edition, poor quality of sound","This maxi was released by small Austrian recording company. I am pretty sure it reached only a few music markets in Europe.The subtitle is ""The Shep Pettibone remix"" because 3 of 4 mixes are done by him.""SP disco attack"" and ""SP radio mix"" were reworked to fit 1990' and one can easily hear it.It's a different story with the version made by The Vogue. They decided to slow down the song to almost tempo of a ballad. But is works:)Pettibone used the same trick in his last mix (""Acapella & string mix""). And these are the strings that added very nice feeling to this version.As I wrote in the title of my review the sound quality is suprisingly poor. I assume it is caused by the recording process. The music's volume is really low. The average volume on my cd player is 5-6, but when I play this compact I have to increase to 9-10.This made me deduct one star."
5,Great!,"I loved to cook food with Turmeric. Recently, I read an article that mentioned that turmeric contains a compound that lowers testosterone levels. I don't want to use this product now as I'm working hard at the gym to gain muscle mass."
3,Misrepresentation,"There is cheaper organic turmeric of the same quantity on amazon, however, I chose this one because it looked like it comes in a jar. Instead, it came in a bag, so the higher price tag was not worth it. The product itself is good, very orange and aromatic, but I do not like the misrepresented picture of the product. It's misleading."
3,Brilliant Jazz fusion moments amongst more traditional Rock fare,"3 1/2Excellent playing throughout with this fantastic progressive all-star lineup, but, as usual, the instrumentals far outweigh their vocal-based, more dated counterparts in terms of sheer musicality."
3,Skimming the surface,"There is simply no way to condense Bing Crosby's prodigious musical catalgue into 12 songs and these are far from his greatest hits or strongest vocals. It's almost insulting. Bing's great songs from his golden era of the 30's and early 40's comprise 12 great songs in *one* year.But is you just want to sample the incomparable magic of Bing, then this is a good pick. The songs selections are thankfully of early vintage, when Bing's voice was indeed a compelling musical instrument. But if you're seriously interested in understanding and appreciating Bing Crosby, please consider buying the better 4-disc collection offered on Amazon."
5,Christmas Gift,Mother loves the CD. Listening to Bing brings back memories of such a good time in her life. Thanks for having it available. Would buy from this dealer again.
3,You can probably do better...,"This is an adequate survey of some of the highlights of a variety of religious writings. Unfortunately, I was looking for information on the mystics, not the author's summary of what he thought was the important mystical texts. If you're looking for this type of info, you probably already have or know a lot of the material in this book. ""Cliff Notes"" for mystics just doesn't makesense to me!"
5,Go to a quiet place to read...,"This wide-ranging anthology collects all the essential texts and themes of great mystic traditions of the world -- from Buddhist, Taoist, Jewish, and Christian to Hopi, Hindi, Islamic, Sikh, Aboriginal, and Kogi. Provides analysis and historical information with special attention to the sacred feminine mystics. Well introduced with important historical information. This is an approachable guide to the unique and inspiring personalities that define the mystical experience."
5,Trekker Elite!,"Just bought this trekker dvd and after watching the series for over 10yrs vote this as one of the best. I have come to enjoy Justine and Ian as hosts and bring a lot of excitement to travel [the way it should be!] This dvd and megan mcCormick's Scotland are in my opinion, the best in the series!"
3,"Repetetive, Not enough racing footage.","While good at giving us some of Senna's insights into his desire and love of racing and life in general, I had hoped for much more racing footage. Most of what footage there is has been marred by, of all things, overly loud flute music. While certainly making for an ""artsy"" effect, I would much rather have heard the F1 engines' own music. Really a bit bizzare. I had also hoped for much more footage and commentary regarding some of Senna's most incredible drives. The Crash is not shown. I certainly expected it to be present and had hoped for much more commentary and updated information on it. A good rental video but I don't think I'll watch it more than twice."
5,Part II on Senna the Master,"This video was put together by the same French production team that did, Racing Is In My Blood. That video was made before his death, but A Star Named Ayrton Senna was made after his death, using some of the same footage, but improved with poignant interviews with people who knew Ayrton, including childhood friends in Brazil.A very touching and moving documentary. Like Racing is in my Blood, the producers allow Ayrton himself to describe what he was feeling and how he did the things he did. The day of his death is handled very respectfully and not presented in any great detail. The last part of the video is devoted to the work of the Ayrton Senna Foundatation, and the many thousands (now millions) of poor Brazilian children that they have helped. Must have video."
4,Excellent - E !!!!,"Who else, but only Senna!!!. Great video, good commentary, I would have liked it much more if it had some more racing scenes."
4,Musical Compilation from 1959 re-issue.,"This is a 1959 theatrical compilation re-issue of the Hal Roach musical Our Gang comedies. Good for the novelty of seeing what some of these compilations look like, but these are best seen in their original form as on the Cabin Fever DVDs."
3,Caveat emptor,"Prospective purchasers of this 4-CD set ought to be advised that there is a lot of terrific music here but that very little of it is even remotely reflective of the Charles Mingus (the mature rebel!) who would emerge in the mid-1950s. Especially disappointing, to this listeners ears, was disc two, almost entirely comprised of very conventional selections (I'm not sure they even merit the label ""jazz"") from Mingus' days as part of the Red Norvo Trio. Almost as disappointing is the fact that many of the higher quality selections boast fairly dreadful sound, hence the three stars I'm giving this collection despite the fact that fans of 40s jazz as well as Mingus completists will find much here that they are likely to value."
2,only if you are a HUGE fan,"well...i love vinnie moore and to my opinion he is one of the most amazing guitar players in the world...he is fast , great feel , great melodies.this album is good but it's like the MAZE album and those albums are not his best albums...the early ones - mind's eye and time odyssey are his best albums...maybe this one is more mature but not the best neo-classical album i've heard from him.if you are a big fan buy this album but you can skip it."
2,J.C. A guitar and music for the mind Professor,"This album although well executed is dissappointing as I ordered it from customer recommendations the expectations were great but. Compared to Steve Vai this guy is like a wet weekend. I did not find even one track that held me, it was more like background music compared to what I normally listen to. Even though the guy can play very well there was no soul in it, no fun, no excitement,no hairs on the back of the neck stuff. Still I will keep trying some of the newer guys may come up with something amazing, you never know"
3,"Not a bad album, but disappointing for a master like Vinnie","In my opinion, this is my least favorite Vinnie Album. Other than some of the acoustic songs, none of the songs grabbed me. I have all of Vinnie's albums and this one sounds like he ran out of ideas. The best albums in my opinion are ""Out of Nowhere"" and ""Minds Eye"". Those albums seemed to have a lot more to them. His chops are awesome as always, but the album is a little boring. I do enjoy the acoustic numbers and a few electric ones, but Vinnie has done better. Vinnie fans will still enjoy this one, but I will never say it is his best. I feel like it's his worst, but even Vinnie's worst is still pretty good. 3.5 stars. Vinnie, it's time to get a little more variety."
3,Testing the waters,"I'm not sure what to think, it seems like Vinne might be trying to go a different direction on the last half of the album, but still has yet to define the direction itself. I hope the next effort is more defined.This is still pretty good though, I'm always amazed at how fluid Vinne can play with such small amounts of distortion."
4,'Poetry of Golden Dawns',"As you can see in other reviews, the opinions on this very unique effort are strongly divided. Several friends have called this the 'Flock of Seagulls' album for its lofty synth sound, yet they soon are drawn into the stellar beauty of this album.I scoffed at it for several years until a friend coerced me into playing it on a late-night road trip. Then it grabbed me - the sheer lucid, philosophical feeling one gets in the wee hours of the morning. I don't know what these guys were up to when they recorded this, but I always envision a mountain retreat rife with meditation and then quick into the studio to capture the mood on tape. Play ""Exile"" or ""Wintergardens"" at this time of night, and you will certainly feel the indescribable lucidity that radiates from this album.Not a good starter Joke lp, but very important to anyone who realizes they have a soul."
1,Lousy,"Back when this album came out I thought it was great. Listened to it all the time. Then I graduated and it went home with my roomate. Several years later I saw it at the local CD store and remembering how much I liked it I bought a copy and drove home expecting to be just as pleased with it in 1995 as I was in 1986. Well, I matured but the music remained the same. I was very disappointed. The CD simply was not nearly as good as I remembered it. In fact shortly after buying it I took it to a used CD store and sold it. Killing Jokes earlier music was fantastic but this was truly trite and overly produced junk. Avoid this CD adn buy something from their earlier days."
1,One word : Garbage,Killing Joke is just a joke everyone laughs about and their music is just awful . Four words : Don't buy this CD !
2,Overblown,"This CD came out when I was in college and I loved it back then. I thought it was brilliant. Fast forward ten years and I am in a music shop and decide to pick it up. I got home, anxiously unwrapped it, put it in my CD player waiitng for the magic to come again. It didn't. The music didn't age well at all. It is light, fluffy and overly dramatic. The synth hooks are formulaic and the constant echo on the lead vocals is annoying. About two weeks after buying this with high expectations I sold it back at a used record store. That about says it all..."
5,Timely Content,"In light of the current ""scandels"" in the corporate world, this writing is very timely and the advice is ""right on"". If the executives and board of American Airlines had practiced the principles laid out in this book, they might not be in the situation in which they now find themselves. Every individual in corporate leadership should read this. An excellent read!"
3,Disappointing Shemp Collection,"Three Shemp Stooge shorts and one Curly short. There is a theme of the Wild West running through most of then apart from ""Vagabond Loafers""... Loafers is a remake of ""A Plumbing we will go"" featuring plenty of stock footage & Shemp recreating Curly's fiasco in his own wonderful style. This is the strongest episode in the collection, in my opinion.But overall, this is disappointing. The Wild West episodes aren't very funny, in fact, they're quite dull. Even Curly & Shemp can't liven up some dull scripts and stories. A couple of the stories are too similar and shouldn't have been on the same DVD. One of the stories has a long, tedious, drawn out scene where they are trying to get Larry out of a prison cell.The other Shemp collection - Spook Louder -- is much better."
5,"Howard, Fine, Howard, and Howard in the Old West.","This dvd includes six shorts; 2 are not shown on AMC, 4 are westerns, and 5 Shemps to 1 Curly. The one Curly, Cactus Makes Perfect, is okay, but not a classic. The other 3 westerns; Out West (Shemp's second Columbia short), Punchy Cowpunchers, and Merry Mavericks, are all great. For some reason Stooges fans tend not to like the westerns as much, but I do. Dopey Dicks is a sure classic and worth the price of the dvd alone, and Vagabond Loafers is an excellent remake of A Plumbing We Will Go. All shorts are full screen. Maybe one of these days Sony will have enough confidence in the Shemp shorts that they will put out a dvd with them and not tack on a sub-par Curly-era effort."
2,Weird,"The head of the duck is gigantic, and its cheap plastic. Really cheap. *no pun intended*..I thought this was cute when I saw it online, but once you receive it you realize what a waste of money it was. Wouldnt ever buy again."
5,Quality product,You can tell from the feel this US flag is made from quality material with heavy grommets and stitching that will stand up to wind and weather. I like the 2'x3' size for our porch - that was a major factor in picking this flag.
3,Colors fade away within 1 year,"it may last forever, as one revier stated, but fades away after just one season. plan to replace every year ..."
2,"Run very very small, finish was ragged","This shoe was said to be an 7.5W but was too narrow to even try on. The manufacturer's labeling and my expectations were WILDLY different.Worse, the finish on the seam around the throat of the shoe, especially over the toes was actually ragged, with threads coming up before they were even out of the package. Back in the box they go.Big disappointment, as I have a new job and will walk to the train to go to work. I thought these would be great, but they're not."
5,Comfy pumps,I bought two pair of these. The suede is supple and the shoes are comfortable enough to walk around in all day (important for me). The only drawback is the interior is black and the dye rubs off on your feet/stockings.
3,crap mouse...,Product description/in the box details state comes with optical mouse... yet it does not. Otherwise okay thus far as it's just been set up today.
1,TERRIBLE Job of Remastering,"Echo and ditto to those reviews that degrade the remastering job. What a shame, absolutely fantastic music also. Waste of money to get any of the three U.K. albums unless you have never had them on disc. Go with the original CD's instead or download the first album off Itunes."
2,POORLY REMASTERED CLASSIC,"OK, I like the music on this album a lot, not as good as the first (well it is missing Bruford and Holdsworth) but as far as music goes it's good album. But this new cd was remastered very poorly. It's all midrange. This applies to the other two UK albums as well. I got all three remasters and played them side by side. The new ones are fine for someone who has never owned any UK but if you have the old ones (on EG) and you have a good stereo you will want to keep them. The sadest part is that the remastering was done by none other than Eddie Jobson himself. I don't know if Eddie has lost his hearing, if the master tapes were toast or if he rushed it but this great album was not done justice by this pressing."
5,"Progressive rock gem, terrible hiss in remaster","One of the best progressive cd's of all time in my opinion. It is a pity this group disbanded. Highly recomended for drummers (Terry Bozzio is outstanding here), and Wettons bass work ir remarkable, as well as Jobson's keyboards an violin. A must for ELP fans. Excellent songs and recording. Also recommended: Their fist and last records.Now, about the 2009 remastering made my eddie jobson, sadly it has way too much treble, like made for the mp3 generation. The older eg records versions are a lot better if you do not like this hissy modern remastering."
5,zero stars for not remastering it and charge us like they did,"The music itselg is a 5 star prog gemThe japanese treatment: expensive and beautiful packaging.but... Most japanese replicas come remastered and even with extra trackswel. this is a joke, a scam,I have listened carefully and they did no remaster it , the sound exactly the same as in the eg copies, and the sleeve does not mention nothing about it.35 dollars for te same 25 year old audio? f.... you ¡"
4,Excellent prog rock,"UK's second and final studio album, 1979's ""Danger Money,"" features tight, straight-forward prog rock, with long tracks, tricky rhythms, and lots of really cool keyboard solos. Danger Money is a big improvement over the band's debut album, and features an astonishingly big sound considering the band had slimmed down to a trio (keyboards/bass/drums). The first half is flawless: the martial title track, the romantic ""Rendevous 6:02,"" and the wild musical ride of ""Only Thing She Needs."" The second half isn't quite as strong, but offers solid highlights as well. If you're a fan of Emerson Lake and Palmer, or any prog rock, this album is highly recommended."
5,One of the best record,I know the Danger Money music for more then 20 years. For all this time I've been thinking there is no week point on this record. Fantastic piece of music...
2,minor league ELP,"The first U.K. album was a recording of great promise. The musicians: John Wetton, Bill Bruford, Eddie Jobson and Alan Holdsworth combined to make an innovative, creative debut that left one eager for future developments. Unfortunately, such developments never came about as Bruford and Holdsworth departed to form Bruford, a progressive jazz-fusion outfit. Jobson and Wetton were left to carry on without them. Rather than recruit another guitarist they opted to transform the band into that of a power trio with Terry Bozzio on drums. This strategy looked better on paper. Where all three are talented musicians they are all better suited to the role of backup. None are to be considered a virtuoso on their respective instruments. The compositions are also weaker than on the previous effort and reveal a more pop-oriented compositional flair. This is a disc worth passing over. Purchase the debut, pass this one over....Simon"
4,Fusion for the Esoteric Music Minded,"Danger Money (U.K.) is brought to life by returning veterans Jobson and Wetton with new commer Terry Bozio (of Missing Persons). This three piece adds crescendos of flying 32nd notes, intense time signatures and a whirl of haunting melodies that intrigue the mind of the esoteric music appreciator. I miss Holdsworth from the first U.K. album!"
4,You'd have to REALLY like the ED songs... ^^;,"If you like the music of Ranma Nibunnoichi, this CD is a must. I don't like many of the songs, though, or else I'd give it a higher rating (I like the OP songs better.. ^.^)... Well, it does have the full-length Lambada Ranma, which I just love.. ^.-;"
5,great book,This book has been really helpful especially giving information regarding color schemes in monocrome with different blooming cycles . A must for gardners!
5,Just what I wanted,"I bought this album mainly for one song, The Unicorn. The whole album is delightful and I'm very glad I bought it. Shopping with Amazon is pleasant, easy and inexpensive. Love it. Thanks for being around."
2,BEST OF THE IRISH ROVERS??,IF I WANTED A CD FOR MY GRANDKIDS I WOULD GET A BARNEY CD. THE 20 WORD MIN. IS A GREAT WAY SHUT DOWN COMPLANTS ABOUT THE PRODUCT..PS:THE IRISH REVOLUTIONARY SONGS CD WAS ALSO TERRIBLE...
5,I have been looking for this!,"I have the Greatest Hits on LP, but it's rather hard to find a player these days. I love these guys! I have been a fan of The Irish Rovers since I first heard them, and I am glad to know that I can still find their music!"
2,disappointing,Not in the same league as any Tommy Makem/Clancy Bros. disc. Selections and performances below par for this type of CD.
5,Oldie but Goldie,This is an older album but has some of the Rovers greatest hits including the Unicorn song. If you like Irish folk music this is a must have
4,GOOD FUN MUSIC,It was always one of my favorite albums when it first came out. It still is one of the best in 2008.
3,Old v. New,Please note that this is a re-release of old recordings done by the Rovers in the 1960's and early 70's. Compare to all their newer recordings by visiting their website on line.
3,The Best of the Irish Rovers,I knew I would like the cd because amazon gave an accurate account of the songs on the disk.
1,Closer to the Main Street Singers than to the Dubliners or the Clancy Bros,"This is a saccharine and banal take on Irish music, with all the emotional intesity of a Hummel figuraine. Upon first listen, I remarked to my wife that they sounded more like Peter, Paul, and Mary than the Dubliners. She correctly pointed out that Peter, Paul, and Mary were actually much better than this pablum, and that the Irish Rovers more closely resemble the fictional Main Street Singers from a Mighty Wind.Truly, absolutely, unlistenably passionless, cloying and bland."
3,"i am looking for the single, grandma got runover by a reind","i am despretly looking for the single grandma got runover by a reindeer by the irish rovers for my mom, it is her all time favourite christmas song, and i would love to find it for her, if anyone has it, please e-mail me, i would pay anything to get it for her thanks julie"
4,I'd personally like to thank Lily the Pink,"for her medicinal compounds! This cd combines some hilarious drinking songs with children's songs. The former are well worth the patience involved in getting through the latter.THE ORANGE AND THE GREEN provides an amusing look at the difficulties involved in being the mixed offspring of Catholic Irish and Protestant Scottish-Irish parents (""being strictly neutral, I bashed everyone in sight!"")while LILY THE PINK is an amusing story about the efficacy of a woman's medicinal compounds which were some less than expected: ""Ebenezer thought he was Julius Caesar so they put him in a home and gave him medicinal compound, now he's Emperor of Rome!"" They also cured an indivdual with a ""terrible stammer"" after which ""he's s-s-seen but n-n-never heard.""And of course there is the slightly more subtle humor regarding Ms. Crandall's boarding house. One should just listen and enjoy.Grab it with a copy of your favorite Gaelic Storm cd and laugh all your problems away."
5,Piazzolla and Mulligan at their best,"Even though Piazzolla himself said he had a terrible time recording this album, he had been enamored with Gerry Mulligan and his ensemble for some time. Piazzolla was always intent on combining jazz and tango, coming up with his popular ""Nuevo Tango,"" and this cd, though a little farther on the jazz side still has many typical Piazzolla characteristics.""Summit,"" the title track is probably my favorite--it starts out with a typical Piazzolla fugue on bandoneon, joined by bari sax on the second phrase, then marimba and elec. guitar, and piano and bass. Then all the instruments join together, and Mulligan has room for a solo. Very exciting and fun cd, good for either a jazz fan or a Piazzolla fan."
3,Wonderful record... but an undesireable edition.,"I was very disapponted to listen to such a bad edition of an otherwise wonderful recording of two great musicians. The original recording I used to listen to was evidently from another company, and the cover was in black&white. If I din't live so far away, I would look for another edition and buy it again, really worth the pain. These two reach such perfection in their interpretation, it's difficult to get the tunes out of your head. One record that can be heard over and over again"
1,Don't waste your money .....,"This is terrible, if what you are looking for is a travel guide.If you want to watch a sort of cute young lady's home movie of traveling in Italy, you might like this. It gives very little helpful information about traveling in the region.There are other companies who produce helpful travel guides."
1,EUROTRAH biased view of Italy...,"In my view is a quite typical travel guide for the eurotrash tourist, pulls all the stops for parties, multicutural experiences, BIASED view of the city and of the Italians (mafia...), politically correct blabber, and little or no geology, science, history of the city. EUROTRASH tourist guide for poor Europeans that think they are rich enough to pick others problems. Maybe the need to belong too???"
2,Gimme Ghosts of American Astronauts,"The two stars I give to this collection is solely for the Mekons excellent song ""Ghosts of American Astronauts"". Although the rest of the selections may be interesting rock history they are for the most part uninspired and forgettable as songs. If you like collecting obscurities for obscurity's sake then be my guest but if you are looking for well crafted memorable songs then this collection contains only one-the aforementioned ""Ghosts of American Astronauts""."
5,Thank you WLUW,"WLUW in chicago played this album all the time when it came out. Hüsker Dü, Dino Jr and the rest are the only redeeming part of the Eighties. This makes you realize that there was good music during that decade. You just had to go underground."
1,Misprinted,i bought one (sealed!!!!). it contains cd by brian Eno. beware!!!hope i could have the right one...
5,DIFFERENT BUT GOOD,by different I mean it's not the original UK. I was fortunate enough to catch the original lineup in New York's Central Park not long after the first album was released. It really isn't fair to compare this band or album with the original band. Standing on its own merits I like this album a lot. Terry Bozzio and Bill Bruford are two completely different drummers.John Wetton and Eddie Jobson are ace musicians. Jobson does a super job on keys and violin. This particular 3 piece format works for me. I like how they handled the songs without a guitarist. Caesar's Place Blues is especially entertaining. If you don't compare this UK to the original UK then there's a chance you will enjoy this CD. This surely isn't the worst music you'll ever hear!![...]
1,CD being sold is Eno NOT UK,Heed the warnings here (like I didn't) that the CD comes in the correct case and is also labeled as UK but actually contains Eno music. I love Eno but I wanted to hear UK. Do not buy this CD until this problem is corrected
4,good time after time,Band just doesn't miss a beat.Especially with Terry Bozzio keeping time.Not empty at all even without Holdsworth.
3,Where's Holdsworth and Bruford and the sequencers?,"This is a decent live reproduction of U.K ""U.K."" and ""Danger Money"", but it severly lackes the track layering that sequencing and triggering offers. Jobson makes a half hearted attempt at Holdsworth's solo in ""the Dead of Night"". I personally found it a bit disappointing, not living up to Jobson's true talent. Wetton's vocals didn't have range and the Bozzio's drums were mixed way back. A lot of his (Terry's) fills and accents are completely lost (don't listen to this piece on cassette). I still love them, though. But this cd is ""play once in a while"" on my list."
1,HORRIBLE REMASTERING!,"Stay away from Edduie Jobson's alleged ""remasters"" of the three UK albums, ""UK,"" ""Danger Money"" and ""Night After Night."" All three sound horrible! They are muddy with all the high frequencies rolled off. Save your money and look for the Editions EG versions. They sound MUCH better."
1,Misprinted CD; wrong album,"I received this CD from a couple of different sources including Amazon.com. In both cases, only when I played the CD did I know it was the wrong album (""Voices"" by Roger Eno). Both the cover and CD are printed as ""UK Night After Night""."
2,Its great but...,"Dont get me wrong, this is a great album, but the sound quality is terrible. The 2cd 'Memories' has replaced this one, and is by far amuch better investment, even for the casual elvis fan. Besides, this one has some edited versions, like the gospel medley, which is restored in its full lenght in the 'memories' cd. So, even though, this is the original relese, save your money and go get the other one."
4,The Album that saved his carear,"In the late 60's, Elvis had become stale and a joke. But after his NBC tv special (and this album) people sat up and rememberd the King once again. This album could be thought of as the first""unplugged"" album. It is an impressive mixture of live full blown sets, and personal acustic sets with just the King, a few guitars, and a bunch of screaming girls. This is a novel album, but the constant listenability is small. I like this album, but would rather listen to a studio album. But a true Elvis fan should own this album..."
4,The King's return to the Stage.,"After a few years in the army and a few years of doing movies,Elvis hadn't performed live in front of an audience for a decade. Elvis-Tv Special is the audio recording of the 1968 NBC-TV Special, that marked Elvis' return to stage.At the time of this concert the king still had it. He went out there with his band and rocked the house with many of his best songs.The performances are quite good, and much better than most of the live albums that would follow. If you're curious about Elvis in concert this is the CD to buy."
3,Not The Best Introduction To ABAP,"I bought the book looking for a good first look at ABAP hoping that it would give a good introduction and overview into the ABAP environment instead it jumps right into code. I gave the book 3 stars and there is nothing wrong with the book. One complaint though is that it will only give you a page or so on each function without completly explaining the when and where of using the function. I quess I am used to the very user friendly Microsoft books which go in to great detail about the when and where of each function. I will use this book as a reference and for users who already have a foot in the door with ABAP it is a good book, just not the best introduction into ABAP."
1,Not enough.,I attended the ABAP academy and received certification. Prior to the academy I read this book. I found it to be better than nothing but other students found the ABAP Objects book to be more current. The ABAP Object book also provides a demo R3 system. This allows the student to practice at home and be more creative. Win 2000 and MS SQL 2000 are required for the demo version. Go with ABAP Objects.
2,Better books available,"Though it does say introduction to ABAP I guess I was expecting more, for instance the book dosn't even review the ABAP editor until a three page appendix in the back of the book. Many pages of the book are wasted repeating program code but never really reviewing what is going on. There never really is a mention of how to manipulate tables in this book so if you need to work with anything other then internal tables (who doesn't) you'll have to find the information elsewhere."
2,Old Version of SAP,"Like every other book for ABAP beginners, this one only covers version 3.x of SAP. We're installing 4.6b, so I'm not sure how much it will help. If you have the 3.x version of SAP, it's not a bad book."
5,Magic does not begin to describe it.,"In my opinion, this is the defining invention of 20th Century America.In the words of a friend, who immigrated to the U.S. from overseas: ""I was amazed when I first discovered about magic shell. I looooooove magic shell. Only America can think of such idea and is able to capitalize on that brilliant idea.""Not quite fudge, not really chocolate, completely absurd. By what black art did the makers conjure the ability for something to freeze in seconds at room temperature? Begs the questions, was it invented by accident, or by a sage?"
1,Eno wrote this one while sleeping,"Eno is such a diverse musician that I felt I had to make sure that people who like his EARLIER stuff, like ""Here Come the Warm Jets,"" and the truly remarkable ""Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy,"" which came out first, wouldn't get stuck buying ""Evening Star,"" and be disappointed since this album is bird watcher walkman material. Unless you like songs that have three notes per minute, you probably won't like this one. Don't let Eno's colossal earlier solo records, and stuff he did with Roxy Music fool you. Evening Star is a totally different pace. Buy ""Before and After Science"" instead, you'll be pleased."
1,Don't waste your money or time with this one.,This album is truly a dud. I through this one in the trash! Eno has incredible talent and it is defintely not represented here. His earlier stuff is superior. I would have given it zero stars if this review would have let me.
5,Profoundly beautiful,"This is a work of sheer beauty. The title track is magnificant pastoral of a simple piano progression and Fripp's soaring guitar and is worth the price of admission. The 'second side' is the abstract 'Index of Metals' 20-odd minutes of layered guitar and synth loops under some of the most beautiful axe-work Mr. Fripp has unleashed. The soon-to-be-dubbed ""Frippertronics"" technique is shown here in all of it's glory, tape saturation and decay...missing in the digital technique adds texture and timbre. No, this is NOT for everybody, but try a taste....it could become one of your favorite albums (as it is mine)"
5,This is so beautiful.,"This is a classic and has stood the test of time. It's so beautiful, your mental images merge together, your mind expands, and you are transported to a place of beauty before not known. To put that with the gentle memories of bygone day, is a treasure and a delight unparalleled."
5,Also got the wrong music on the disk,"I too purchased ""Evening Star"", but the music is ""Before and After Science"". The CD sleeve, and all the printing the CD are correct for ""Evening Star"", but the actual music is ""Before and After Science"". If you bought this disk, and it wasnt like you expected, perhaps you had the same problem."
4,Groundbreaking,"This album, with No Pussyfooting, changed the face of modern music while furthering Fripp and Eno's experimentation and cementing ambient music as a genre (instead of a ""one off"", No Pussyfooting is often considered the first ambient album).On this album, Eno perfected his ""treatments"" and Fripp incited an inner revolution in his already revolutionary guitar playing.Note: The previous reviewer has no idea what s/he's talking about since this IS part of Eno's ""earlier stuff""."
2,I'm Really disappointed.,"I'm not gonna recap what happens in this volume, since it's so terribly boring. I had high hopes for this anime since it's from the creators of Sakura Wars. The story sounded interesting, and the character designs looked cool. the only 2 things that this anime has going for it are the cool character designs and the decent story. This anime has really outdated animation. It's on par with animation 10 years before it's time. The voice acting is also terrible. The character sound like they are only half awake. The story really kinda drags too. There is no way I can recommend that anyone watch this series."
4,if you liked the movie then...,"...you will most likely enjoy this sountrack. listening to this cd you can almost retrace the precise scenes of the movie. it evokes those same melancholy yet strangely uplifting emotions. my only disappointment with the soundtrack was the exclusion of one particular track. it's the one where paul and his mom are dressed in clown costumes and dance for the children at the hospital. unfortunately i don't know what this song is called or who it is by. it was upbeat and a little more lively, and had it been included would have made for appropriate sountrack (assuming you agree that a soundtrack a collection of songs to represent the movie it is based on). it could have helped to convey the more light-hearted parts of the film. by the way, does anyone know what this song is...?"
5,AWESOME!,This thing detects oxygen in all its oxygeny oxygenness....It plugs in super smooth almost like it was coated in butter. It also threads in beautifully.
3,Dubois: 7 Last Words of Christ in Latin,"This interpretation is good, nevertheless I feel it lacks dramatism. I am comparing with an old LP by Willis Page, with orchestra, organ and soloist. Nevertheless in the absence of another comparable version this will do by now"
2,Not quite as good as the Moving Comfort Juno,"I ordered this bra and the Moving Comfort Juno at the same time. I already had one of the Juno model, and really liked it. This was a first try for the ISIS, and I don't like it as well. It's not as supportive, and the lower band rides up under the bust during workout activity. I might recommend it to someone looking for a little less support (or someone who needs less than a D-cup), but it isn't working for me as well as the Juno."
3,"Great philosophy, good lyrics, but the actual music?!","I got this CD for my son for our van, thinking we could learn the songs and sing them together as we run errands, etc. I really like the idea of Christian music for children, and I like the lyrics of the songs. However, I can not stand the country feel of this CD. I am not a fan of country music at all, and this is just a bit too 'twangy' for me. I can't listen to it. I am giving it three stars because the concept is good, but I just wish I would have known the *style* of music before spending money on it."
4,Exciting praise and worship for jr. church kids,"We are always looking for motivational songs for our children's groups. Since I also teach instruments, I scrutinize the background compilation and rhythms. Overall, the quality of this collection is the best I have reviewed. The minor shortcomings are far overshadowed by the content, artistry and balance of styles. We are currently using JOY and YES! I CAN DO IT to back up our Jr. Church group in their opening exercises. They love the CD and are trying to find some to purchase for their own. The positive attitude supported by biblical principles is outstanding and we look forward to future offerings from this producer. My husband found ours last April while we were shopping in Delaware - it must have been a brand new release - but I am totally baffled as to why we cannot locate it in Michigan. I suppose we will check the same location when we are there this April."
4,great ambient album,"haunting, beautiful, mesmerizing, great for doing homework, and great if you want to write true mood music. I totally recommend this."
2,New Age Noodling,"OK, so this is the first of the ambient albums that helped to spawn the whole New Age nightmare. It's OK to study to, but don't try to actually *listen* to it, because you'll be bored to tears. Or at least I was. I don't know what the big deal is about this album. Take a really basic sound pattern made up of just a few notes, throw in some tape loops and build upon it ad nausem, and you've got ambient music. Me, I prefer actual songs. Give me ""Another Green World"" over this any day."
2,___,"After listening to some of the ambient works of todays artists such as Aphex Twin and Autechre this music feels a little bit outdated. It doesnt mean that this music is bad by no means, it's nice ambient stuff. My main objection with this album however is not with the music but with the copy-protected disc. It didnt work very well in my freestyle and not in my computer either. They should put warning signs on copy-protected cd's, like the ones with Explicit Lyrics."
5,good for thinking and writing,I have loved this album for years... and just bought it on CD. It has been great to listen to while I am writing in a noisy library.
5,Relaxing,My favourite music for relaxation and/or meditative states of mind. Music for Airports is never intruding and uses soothing sounds rather than melodies. More minimalistic than most new age music of today.
5,Eno already!,"Commercial flying has certainly changed since ""Music for Airports"" was conceived, but Eno helps us remember when flying was physical metaphor, and existential thrill. The most pleasant experience in recent domestic U.S. air travel has been that concourse under the United Airlines terminals at O'Hare, all polished alloy, indirect colored light, and Eno. To be there, is to be inside the music, a place to be cherished. I still play this CD more than any other. It needs a system with good bass; let that first suboceanic chord establish the foundation, feel the structure soar above it and know why flying, and a lot of other things, used to be a lot more fun."
2,Too Repetitious,"I'm a Brian Eno fan and was drawn to this album for the glowing reviews but I found it to be very repetitious. It's almost as if you're paying for a single, not an album. Do yourself a favor and buy his Apollo CD instead, which is a far more interesting and moving piece."
1,AAAGGGHHH,"Holy cow, I was ready to rip my hair out after listening to this. Horrible, sophomoric, insipid... YUK. This is like Chinese water torture. drip drip drip on and on. YAAAGGGHHHHH"
1,not comfortable or durable...,"The chair is attractive and I am sure the fabric is durable. However, the seat cushion crushed and was uncomfortable within a few hours of use. The wood bar that extend across the front of the chair was also immediately uncomfortable."
2,Ok.,Naruto ultamite ninja is not all that. This particular game had a lot of bugs in it and is lacking the ever so cool rpg mode of its succsesors.In the end I feel sorry for you people with american ps2s because you will never be able to enjoy naruto to its fullest. I just recently recived my copy of naruto narutamite hero 3 (of as it is called in the US ultamite ninja) and it blows this game out of the water with 58 characters and an awsome rpg mode.
4,YOU MUST READ THIS NARUTO FAN OR NOT,"this game isnt just one of those fighting games like after you win it stays in the game droor and gets dusty with all the others. This game is a game you will not want to stop playing.In scenario mode you do things from the show but in mission mode its even better. You could be a genin go through the chunin exams etc. There's 7 levels of Ninjas. You can be an Academy Student, Genin, Chunin, Special Jonin, Jonin, the Hokage's special force Anbu Black Ops, and even Naruto's dream a Hokage.You can relive the show once you master this game it feels great to smack the little charachters around every now and then and get paid to get bonus material for it. You should pick this game up especially if you're a Naruto fan."
2,"not the best game, audio should had been better and part2 is the best","This game was okay but not the best, i have to say ultimate ninga2 and clash of ninga2 are the best naruto games the other naruto games were okay, but this game was okay."
4,"Great game, but only for the fans.","This is a good game that is great for hour on end, but only is you are a fan of the show. Those who don't like the show, I have seen, have no interest in the game what so ever. So if you don't like the show, simply don't buy it! If you do like the show, this game has your name written all over it!"
5,Good Game,I bought this game for my son and he loves it! The graphics and story mode are good. It is not too easy or too hard to play.
2,Bad Quality,"I ordered this a while ago, and was very disappointed in the quality. The voices are not the same, the game is quite boring compared to ultimate ninja 2 and 3. But worst of all, there's no where that you can change difficulty or sound. I wouldn't waste my money on something as crappy as this."
1,Stupid book.,I bought this and ended up giving FREE MONEY to the author.. The material in the book is easily found online and did not actually provide any insights as advertised.
1,Waste of time & money,"This product is sold with many different covers and each claims to have new data, they are all the same."
4,Sex info that everyone should know - well done with humor.,"This book is full of basic information on sex we all should know. It is presented with taste and humor. I laughed out loud in many places, but still understood and learned things without being embarassed. A good book to give a teenager to learn the responsibility and concerns that come with the awareness of our sexuality."
3,Well...,"Likeable enough, but sometimes the humor reads like they're trying just a bit too hard to be clever. Naughty-cutesy vibe got on my nerves--the little fairy-elf fluttering around Mother Nature (of course he's gay!) needed to be swatted away. I'd be a little concerned that it's humorous tone makes it easier to dismiss some of the really important things covered--fertility cycles, diseases--but if you start reading the book looking to learn, you'll find something useful and interesting. Covers a LOT of ground in a very immediate (if cursory), friendly way, and I found the co-author's views to be rational and non-judgemental--quite a helpful thing if you're trying to explain the basics not only of sex, but sexuality, to teens (or the just plain *sheltered*). Not for everyone, but even if you're offended by the sex acts <i>themselves</i> depicted in this, it's hard to be put off by a squiggly little lo-fi cartoon."
5,funny and informative,"I would recomend this book for every one. It is funny and entertaining enought to keep a person reading but it contains enough information to get something out of the book. The book has a rather small section (5-15 pages) on how to fix sexual problems, but the main focus on the book is more on explaining and listing human sexual nature."
3,Kind of boring,"Sex makes people crazy. Some people try to control it by becoming puritans. Others just let themselves go crazy. Besides the psychobabble and the Safe Sex sermons there's not really much to distinguish this comic from hundreds of other sex comics like Cherry or Omaha the Cat Dancer. The only reason why someone would read this would be to read up on Larry GOnick's current work. Sadly Larry Gonick has yet to do another Cartoon History of the Universe which were funny and informative.Maybe if I hadn't read <b>Cartoon History of the Universe</b> expecting great things from this book, I wouldn't be so disappointed."
2,Fun Read,"The book was a little old and torn up, but I got it as a little gag gift for my bf who loves Larry Gonick."
2,"Gonick has done better, and his quizsical nature doesn't sh","Gonick misses with this one. He gets credit for Chapter one and two in the T-P, verso and seems to rely too much on Donald Buss and cohorts. He then compounds the problem with illustrating the liberal views of the co-author which would not play outside of California Bay area. For the illustrator of a statistics book, Gonick accepts some rather dubious surveys and statistics without 'n', method of selection, cross tab etc. Better finish off the History of the Universe which at least has an annotated bibliography and expresses doubts."
2,Why?,"Ok, as far as budget productions go, I've heard worse. Still, I can't see why you would buy this version when there are so many good versions of this musical on the market.If you do decide to buy it, bear in mind that the orchestration is very poor, and the voices are nothing special (Judas is alright, though)."
1,Sounds muted,"Just purchased a set of these 151's from Amazon because I need to use a mic with my headphones for telephone calls and such. I find the audio quality to be inferior to my old headphones (Audio-Technical ATH-PRO5 MS) which are about the same price and have a clearer, crisper sound. The 151's sound muffled with too much base. I'm going to have to find something that sounds as good as my old headphones with a mic and return these."
3,Nice Sound Quality But Too Big and Heavy,"I purchased the headphones after reviewing the feedback on on Amazon. I was inbetween this pair and something from Logitech. I decided on this pair because other reviews said they were made better and I honestly trusted to name a bit more. I liked the sound quality and the microphone seemed to work well based on feedback from the people I was talking with on Skype. However, the headphones are pretty heavy and they do not adjust to be small enough to fit my head. I am fairly petite so maybe these headphones might work better for a larger person or someone who wears beanies, etc. while using the headphones. They don't have much adjustment and not only were they too tall, but too wide. I gave them to my in-laws who needed a pair. They are pretty happy with them so I guess it just depends on your comfort level with heavy headphones. If they had been a bit smaller I would have kept them."
5,This headset is awesome,"After using a pair of PC150's daily for the past 7-8 year, I was upset when they broke (due to my clumsiness -- turns out they will break eventually if you frequently knock 'em off your desk onto a hard floor). My brand new PC151's are every bit as good -- the bass response is noticeably better than the old ones, actually (although that could just be from age/abuse :)I love that they use my existing sound card, no USB drivers or separate sound card needed. The mic switch and volume control on the knob are waaaaaay handy, and I've never had any complaints about voice quality while using voicechat during online gaming sessions.Only complaint is that they're a little tight on the head when brand new, but I do have kind of a big head I guess.All in all, I've gotten more money's worth out of these than pretty much any of my other computer stuff."
4,Good choice for PC gaming,"These are good-sounding headphones with a nice microphone for a decent price. My only complaint is that they sit *on* the ear rather than over. It's a bit less comfortable (the foam is a bit stiff), and it allows outside noise in. Some people may prefer this anyway. They use standard audio cables rather than USB, which allows you to use them with more devices, but also means they won't work with your XBox 360."
2,Wire and plugs are very flimsy,"The headset itself is nice. However, the connecting wire and attached mich/speaker plugs are very low quality. The mich plug on my set became useless after limited usage even though I was always careful. For a few cents more, Sennheiser could have made a decent total product by adding a reasonably strong wire and connectors. Unless you really intend to baby this thing, I would suggest buying a more well-built unit."
2,"Great sound for 3 months then it failed, 2nd one in 6 months.",Great sound and features for less then 4 months on this one.It replaced a the first one I bought that lasted almost 6 months.I will see how the RMA process goes.Both of these lost outgoing sound in less then 6 months.
3,OK Headset,"Headphones: Low quality, not for listening to music.Microphone: Good quality, voice sounds clear and smooth. It picks up room tone and background noise if you have the mic volume up.Comfort: Good for a few minutes. It starts to hurt my head after a little while because it's a little too snug for me.Etc: It has volume control on the cord, which is useful."
2,"Not sure if I have a defective unit, but it wouldnt have mattered anyway","I bought this headset on a recommendation. While the headphones were fine, the microphone is a whole different story. It would not stay in place, constantly sliding down. I'm assuming this is a defect, but even if this wasn't happening, I had another major problem - no one I was playing games with could hear me over the game because the microphone was not close enough to my face.I've used a few other Sennheiser products before, and they're good quality stuff. This particular headset, however, should be avoided. While the actual headphones are fine, if that's all you're looking for, you can probably get a much better pair for a comparable price."
3,Not special,"I bought this to replace a Logitech ClearChat Pro USB headset (the cord ripped out when it was caught in a drawer, sigh) and was very disappointed when I plugged it into my sound port (this is not a USB headset).However, after I purchased the Syba USB Stereo Audio Adapter, the sound was compatible for both the earphones and the microphone.Overall I still liked the Logitech better."
4,Solid Headset,"These headsets work well and are generally reliable. As with any headset, try to be careful of letting the wire get run over a chair because over time, it will inevitably damage it enough to require a replacement."
3,"Sounds good, not that comfortable","I bought this headset expecting it to have circumaural ear cups (go around your ear), but instead they are the type of ear pads that sit on your ear. They feel pretty good, but are a problem for extended gaming as my ears start to hurt eventually (even worse if you wear glasses).Sound quality is good, the mic is excellent as well, and the inline volume control / mute functions fine. The mute does make a small ""pop"" when flipped that sometimes makes people think we've been disconnected, but isn't very loud.The headband is comfortable, but the adjustment is just plastic sliding on plastic, so eventually it wears down and doesn't hold adjustment very well.Overall I would buy them again if it wasn't for the design of the ear cups, I much prefer a circumaural design."
1,Microphone quality is horrid!,"I read the reviews and noticed there was some negative ones in regards the noise cancellation quality... should have pay heed. I like the brand, in fact my current headphones are in-the-ear Sennheiser ones and I love them. But the microphone quality in this particular one is, well, I don't think there is a word in English for it really. I returned them within the hour. Stay away if you're looking for the ability to make decent VoIP calls and so forth. I then went to Logitech ClearChat H390, and those are 1,000 times better. The best ones I've ever had as far as microphone quality and clarity."
1,Downgrade to Previous Review,This is only the second day I've used this headset. It has a short in the wire that causes irritating static. I'm returning this product and buying a Logitech.
2,Microphone stopped working in < 3 months,"Feels good, sounds good but the mic broke after < 3 months of use. Not impressed. The logitech is $20 cheaper and is better since it is digital and uses USB, however it is not as comfortable as the Sennheiser."
1,Very disappointed,"Before I get into the negatives, I will point out the one plus feature. It has an in-line mic mute and volume control. I think all headsets should have these and is one of the reasons I bought this.I find this headset bulky, heavy, and uncomfortable. Because the earpieces do not fit over the ear but on top, they bend my ears back which becomes very uncomfortable in a short period of time.I expected better sound quality. When listening to music, the sound quality is poor.A minor point but at this price I expected a case and there is none."
4,"Liviano, sonido envolvente","Resulta una excelente opción para películas e instrumentos electrónicos, con sonido envolvente, bajos resaltantes, buen aislamiento, en unos auriculares liviandos y comodos. No he podido evaluar apropiadamente el micrófono que viene incorporado, pero advierto que no tiene la impedancia apropiada para sustituir micrófonos para karaoke o entradas para un piano electrónico."
2,Producto defectuoso,"Adquirí los audífonos Sennheiser para mi hijo quien acostumbra comunicarse con sus amigos en la WEB.Lamentablemente la unidad que recibí resultó defectuosa. Al conectar el micrófono se perdía el sonido en uno de los auriculares.Ante los costos que suponía retornar el producto desde Colombia, optamos por desarmar el componente donde se controla el volumen y se silencia el micrófono y encontramos que el pequeño circuito impreso tenía un corto. Desconectamos el cable afectado y soldando una extensión nos saltamos el circuito impreso y el problema se resolvió.La fábrica debería realizar mejores pruebas para garantizar la calidad de estos productos antes de despacharlos al consumidor."
2,shipped wrong!!,"it says delivered,front door,san bernardino.i live in moreno valley.it was in ontario then went to san bernardino and thats the opposite way to mo val!so now i gotta contact amazon some how"
5,Great for people who ear glasses,"I wore my brand new PC151 headset almost eight hours the first day I got them. I thought they might hurt my ears a lot because I wear glasses, but they didn't. I felt a little pressure after eight hours, but that's all; no outright pain like I have felt with other headsets. Admittedly, I have a smaller head than most men, but like I said, other headsets have caused me pain and this set did not.I'm no audiophile, but for me, the sound is very good. I thought the bass might suffer, but it doesn't. Also, the fact that it's not ""open"" (like the PC161), the sound doesn't bother my co-workers in the cube farm when I crank the volume.A good purchase in my opinion."
2,Worked well while it lasted.,"It was nice, worked very well, but heavy. Unfortunately, the connector inside the headset was weak, and got jammed inside, rendering it useless."
4,Great Headset,"The sound, feel and microphone are great. The only con I have is that it does not block outside noises."
3,"Good headset, but not comfortable past an hour or so","These are good headphones, with an excellent mic for skype, Lync or whatever. The headphones have a clean sound and a decent range. No huge bass, but I didn't buy these to game with, but to use with MS Lync, and they do that quite well. The biggest downside, however, is that they simply aren't comfortable after about an hour or so. Get in one of those LONG meetings and you're not going to be happy. I'm back on the market, looking for a new headset. Will need to be comfortable for up to 4 hours continuous, and I'd like better overall sound quality for music."
1,Microphone failed after 2 months,I used this headset for a couple months then the microphone failed. A quick web search showed that this is a common issue. The headset is out of Amazon's return window so I had to send it back to Sennheiser and need to buy another headset to keep working from home...
4,Nice reliable headset,"I purchased this headset a little over two years ago. After 2 years of using it 6+ hours a day most days I am finally replacing it with another of the same. I found it to be excellent quality and very comfortable, and it worked great. I am replacing it only due to a damaged cord, not normal wear and tear. Had the cord not been damaged, I could see this excellent headset lasting another two years easily."
5,Love 'em!,"Affordable headset with above-average performance and comfort. The Sennheiser brand are by no means ""throw-aways"". I'm very pleased."
2,Senn knows how to make some delicate headsets,"I would just like to say that I had these for about 1 month until this headset broke. When they worked, they were very charming and I really appreciated the rich sound. As another reviewer pointed out, these guyz are hot on the ears. I would probably only use this headset for the occasional game of counterstrike and wear some better quality headphones with more breating room for regular listening and gaming.The fantastic sound that these make in mind, my headphones broke remarkably easy. Personally, I am in my latter teens and I am pretty careful of my gaming equipment. I can imagine someone less careful than me having a far less time span of this headset.The cord is undeniably too small and thin, that is all there really is to say. I would invest in a higher quality Senn product because they make great sound."
1,Shaould be o stars,This is my second headphone. One stopped working with the Microphone so I sent it in for warranty repair. The shipping was almost the cost of a new headset. That died. bought a new on and the microphone stopped working.I would not recommend this product. When it works it is great but it is not reliable. Trouble shooting to make sure it was the headset cost me about an hour each time not to mention the time to send the first one back. I definitely will not buy another one.
3,good,"the sound is excellent when i got this stuff,but seems just good,not well work after 1 week,anyway,it's comfortable,and the microphone is quite good ,when i talk with friend,there is no noise inside.Clear enough!"
2,Not as good,"I'm writing this review because I wasn't satisfied with this headset. Don't be fooled by all these other good reviews. I just want to make sure that you will get a nice headset for yourself so that you don't regret buying.1) it gets discomfort after wearing it for more than 1-2 hours because the earphones are just so small, it doesn't fit right over your ear so after wearing it for a while, you will start to feel the tension on your ears and you will not want to wear it any longer. The earphones sits right on your ear!2) the microphone was horrible, can't really hear me when I was chatting3) Don't get it because you will regret buying it."
5,amazing,"I bought this pair after my LOGITECHs USB connector broke when I pulled it out of its USB port. This one doesnt use USB so it hopefully wont rip and the sound doesnt suffer, as a matter of fact THE SOUND IS A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER. I can now do my transciption work a whole lot faster. For 39 buck its a steal of a deal (amazon)."
5,Go-to Headset,"Part of my work requires me to do video-production with voiceover; and these have been my go-to headphones for about 2 years now. This is the third one I own - I managed to break the other two over time by accidentally tugging on the cord too hard, but they usually last for about 9 months - 1 year with amazing headphone and microphone quality. Never buying headphones from another company again!"
5,"The Cowboy Junkies are just wonderfully gifted, and inspired artists.","The Cowboy Junkies are never in a hurry to invite you to enjoy the beauty of their words, their voices, and the music. It honestly take you to a new dimension. Their gift is in removing you from any sense of boredom or maybe even irritation with life, to a place of quiet, deep joy."
2,Black eyed blues,"2 1/2Seems overrated here (what doesn't?), but then again I find most of their albums lacking that true ethereal quality, found in TS, which conveyed a haunting depth through production that songwriting alone sadly cannot repeat. Blues enthusiasts may consider them fresh, though it mostly sounds like the same old structures slightly sexed-up."
5,On par with Trinity Session,"(What the heck does the tag ""appropriate"" mean, anyway? As in, ""no F-word in the lyrics""?)_Black-Eyed Man_ is more conventional and polished, and has more of a Townes Van Zandt/Lyle Lovett feel overall, than _the Trinity Session_ but the songwriting is as good. Even though the songs, overall, are classic Cowboy Junkies mournful, there is still some range in the themes and moods of the individual tracks."
3,good not great,"I have mixed feelings about this knife roll; because of how it is designed with lower pockets it's pretty much a must to use knife protector sleeves too which adds a step in getting ready and putting things away. Adding double time to this task is not so much on my favorite list of to-do's so I find I don't use this very much. If I have the time and motivation to deal with the task, the bag really does work well enough to hold my collection safely though.I'd suggest looking at other choices first before settling on this one."
2,pretty pathetic,"This roll is not well designed, hard to close with pockets full. The larger knife pockets are a bit tight together in my opinion. When full, the velcro doesn't really hold the roll together, so you have to use the velcro around the handles. Would be better with a velcro knife protector and then full zip closure. It would be good for a small set of knives for small jobs or travel, while keeping your full collection in another case. Anyone that needs to keep a lot of tools like me would better go with something much larger."
3,"Serviceable and sturdy, but could use more security","I bought this to carry my first decent knives between my room and the shared kitchen. I like the quality so far-- it seems durable, and it's light and easy to carry, and the cordura resists food stains (essential in a kitchen). One thing that irritates me about the design is that the knife pockets are shallow, and there's no added security like a strap or tie over the handles to keep them from slipping out. So if I'm not careful with how I carry the case, the knives do indeed slide out, rattle around, and could be dangerous if I'm ever careless undoing the zipper. This will last me for a long time, but if one of my friends is looking for a knife roll I'll suggest finding one with deeper pockets or additional security straps. There are additional pockets for things like business cards, etc. that I don't really have a use for, but probably someone will be very grateful for them."
3,Review After One Year Of Service,"Got this one for X Mas last year and I have carried it five days a week during this time period. It has done it job but it could be improved on. The pockets could be deeper so that the knives do not move around so much. I highly recommend a set of those cheap o knife guards if you are going to use this product as I have pierce the side of the case when walking to and from work on more than once. I also had one of the seams along the edge split. A little superglue and it was fine, but once again a little more attention to detail on their part and I would be happier with it. I find that this bag has difficulty with larger knives, but anything with under an 8"" blade was fine. Overall this is a decent bag if you are not going to overload the bag with larger knives, and you are willing to adapt to the bag. Otherwise spend the extra money and get a bag that is one step up from this."
2,Great concept poorly executed.,I ordered this roll for school because I thought it would help me keep organized. Sadly the velcro is terrible and the roll flies open with the slightest movement. The knife slots on the roll are also sewn incorrectly at an angle so some of them are pretty useless. I really love the design of this roll but the craftsmanship leaves something to be desired.
3,Pavilion of Dreams,"Harold Budd's Pavilion of Dreams is only four songs, but over 46 minutes of music. It is great for setting a background mood with a subdued operatic feel. I prefer White Arcades to Pavilion of Dreams, as White Arcades has no vocals, but is all electronic instrumental and piano, and has a more ethereal sound to it."
3,"good, not great music by Harold","Yes, I am a Harold Budd fan, but you have to be a hardcore Harold Budd fan for this album. The best thing about this album is it helped me understand where the album ""The Pearl"" came from. I found the tracks in this album hit and miss. The vocals aspect of the CD sounds like a funeral in slow motion. I would buy ""Luxa"" or ""White Arcades"" before I purchased this CD."
3,Mama's great but who hired the band?,"Big Mama Thornton is without a doubt one of the legends of the blues. What is so upsetting to me is that her wonderful vocals are coupled with an extremely untalented backing band. I haven't done enough research to know the history of the musicians she recorded with but if you listen to the majority of Big Mama's songs, the guitar and piano solos are just horrendous. It's really a shame that someone didn't have the foresight to team her up with some seasoned musicians."
5,Perfect,"Being one of the best ANSI / ISO C++ books I have ever read, Holzner will cover everything about C++ with great detail. The format of this book is smooth to follow, showing you how to code efficiently and properly. The author describes the examples in the book line by line, explaining every section of the code. Beginning programmers, even with little or no experience, will be amazed at how effortlessly they can learn from this Black Book. As for any serious programmer, I would describe Holzner's work as the perfect reference for C++. Each topic presented will gradually help you to become closer to a programming expert."
2,Repeatedly Unhelpful,"I was very disappointed with this book because of the severe lack of actual information. Each chapter is divided into an two sections. I think one is supposedly to give an overview and the other to discuss the topic. Unfortunately, the second section does little more that repeat the cursory and unclear contents of the first section, without adding any real information. Everything seems to be covered, but even after actually reading it page by page, I gained only questions. The data structures and different objects are ""discussed"" but that discussion consists of ""you can <insert some mysterious task> in C++"" without telling you why you might want to do so or giving helpful examples. Then, forty pages later, the same ""discussion"" is presented, as if only to frustrate the reader."
5,Great Book,"I've been very happy with this book, very well written and complete. Takes you from Hello World to some of the more advanced concepts. I would highly recommend this as reference to advanced programmers and educational to beginner programmers."
4,Very Cute,"The plot is formulaic, the dialogue is cheesy, almost cringe-inducing, and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I'd definitely class it as a ""chick flick"" but one that men won't mind seeing either."
4,Michael Vartan... mmmmmmm :),"I bought this film because it Michael Vartan (Vaughn in Alias) plays in it... I never heard of it before my search, but it's surprisingly good !"
2,Kinda Cheesy,"I thought the movie had a good plot, but the writing was terrible! It was totally unrealistic - they meet and fall in love in like 2 days...i know its supposed to be ""love at first sight"" but they both don't get married because of some person they met over the weekend. The only reason to see it is because MICHAEL VARTAN is in it. Overall, if you have nothing else to watch, watch it. but don't watch this instead of another movie"
3,What about The Wedding Planner,Similar to The Wedding Planner and Serendipity ... where two people both engaged to others fall for each other while planning their respective weddings. It's romantic comedy with a weekend in New York full of nuptial shopping and an increasingly nagging question about destiny. Cute and easy to watch but something we've all seen before.
3,Cute but not GREAT!,"This was a very cute movie but I would not suggest buying it. Rather try to catch it on tv. It had a very predictable story line. Again, I love this kind of movie. But this is not one that I would want to watch over and over again."
2,Disappointing,"My husband and I are big fans of Alias. When we saw this at our local video store, we couldn't wait to see it. How disappointing! The writing and editing are dismal, the chemistry between Michael Vartan and Natasha Henstridge is missing that special something that gives movies like When Harry Met Sally and You've Got Mail their magnetism. The movie isn't so bad that you feel compelled to turn it off, but we found ourselves caring more about the best friends getting together than the main characters. All in all, we were hoping to see the kind of passionate intensity that smolders between Michael Vartan and Jennifer Garner in Alias. This movie lacks that fire between the main characters. Without it, it becomes obvious how poor the writing and editing are."
4,Sweet,"This is really not a bad movie. True, the script isn't the greatest thing and it is predictable, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. The plot is interesting, the situation is heartbreaking and the acting is pretty good. The problem this film has is that it is both a chick flick and a drama and it can't seem to decide which it wants to be. If you think you can live with that, then I recommend it. If you don't, then don't buy it. All you basically need to know about the plot is that two people, Anna and Charlie, meet the weekend they are both planning their weddings and they fall in love. And, of course, we all know what happens at the end, but all in all, it is still a pretty romantic movie."
1,Really disappointing,"Being a die hard fan of ALIAS and Michael Vartan, I was on the search for any Michael Vartan movies, and stumbled upon this. To be honest I was quite disappointed in this movie. The script is so old and has nothing new to offer. The only redeeming quality was Micheal Vartan and even he couldn't carry this movie. He had nothing to play off of and it clearly showed since the movie went straight to video... So I would say skip it, unless you are a huge, I mean HUGE fan of Michael Vartan and just want to see him for an hour an half."
4,Chick Flick at its best.,"Michael Vartan is main actor NOT Jospeh Baldwin as stated in other review. This is a feel good movie and is basically a chick flick. Not that there is anything wrong with that. Not likely to win any awards but it is sweet and is harmless. Kind of film you can watch with the girls, a glass of wine and a tub of Ben & Jerrys. (Plus Michael Vartan looks good throughout)"
2,Don't bother,"This movie was predictable, lame, and full of cheesy lines. Though it does contain the adorable Michael Vartan, that does not make it worth viewing even if you are absolutely obsessed with him. His performance as Charlie is quite bland, dull, and unemotional with virtually no facial expressions. It's definitely not his finest. Natasha Henstridge's role as Anna is almost mortifying. She could have at least tried to make her cheesy lines sound realistic, but alas, she fell short (although, with that script, I think anyone would have trouble). In fact, the best part is the interaction between Anna's and Charlie's best friends, Tracy and Henry (Olivia d'Abo and Michael Rispoli). I found them and their sub-plot much more entertaining than the original plot."
2,it had to be bad,"Not surprisingly, I saw this on Lifetime over the summer. It's a cliched version of love and romance. This Vartan fellow says the right thing at all the right times, and the ending is so picture perfect--it makes me sick.I'm a strong believer of true love, but I don't see this as any example. It, like almost all the rest, is merely a fluffy fantasy I care not to indulge in."
3,It had to be you,"It was a cute movie, nothing more than that, life just isn't like that.If only things could fall into place like that we would be all be happy."
3,CORNY,"IF YOU CARE FOR CORNY, PREDICTABLE LOVE STORIES THIS IS THE ONE FOR YOU. MICHAEL VARTAN IS ALWAYS A SAD SOUL IN ALL THE PARTS HE PLAY. HE NEEDS TO LIGHTEN UP AND GET JUCIER PARTS BECAUSE HE IS SO CUTE. OH WELL RENT THIS ONE BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO PURCHASE IT."
1,A Big No,"Ever sit down to watch a chick flick, already with the blanket, fire in the fire place, drink and snack in hand....and then you start the movie and say to yourself...I think they are just reading a script, no chemistry at all between the key characters...predictable...didn't even make it thru the whole thing...shut it down and picked another flick.Don't waste your time."
3,Mils,"I love this movie, they just don't make movies like this any more.It's about a man and a woman who are planning their separate weddings (their partners are too busy). They meet and fall in love.I was not very happy with the condition of the DVD. It was very dirty, like if someone ate something greasy before they handled it. It was all scratched up. The only reason I'm keeping it is because it cost me only $1 and it works. But, I have bought dvds for $0.98 that were in mint condition. This is the first time I've bought a used dvd that was in such bad condition."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,"This book was a huge disappointment! It was a waste of money! I looked forward to finally buying a book about the hall director position so I chose this one. This book has many grammatical mistakes and looks like a first grader wrote it. I let other people see the book and they could not even get through the first 2 chaters. I on the other hand took the time to read the entire thing in hopes that it would get better...but it didnn't. You will be tempted to get the red pen out and mark up the pages! I thought I had bad grammer, but this lady puts me to shame. I am ashamed to think that she has a master's degree and still has this many mispellings in a book. Wendy Edmond, think again before you start to think about writing something else!"
1,Housing Professionals Be Warned--This Book Stinks!,"I was so happy to see that someone had finally written a book about life as a live-in professional in college residence halls. And then I wasted my money on Wendy Edmond's memoir. Even if I ignored the fact that there are at least 10 or more spelling and/or grammatical errors on every page, I wouldn't be able to get past Edmond's style, which sounds as though a first-grader wrote it. Working as a housing professional is a challenging, unique job, and any attempt that Edmond has made to share it with the world is overshadowed by her horrific prose. Don't spend the money !"
4,Excellent,"Ms. Edmond's honestly of what living in a residence hall is about, is down to earth and will provide the reader insights of what life is all about. What a wonderful way to learn what each student's rites of passage is by living in a residence hall."
5,Can't believe I didn't watch this when it first came out.,Intense and makes me want to watch 2 or 3 shows at a time. I will be watching all 8 seasons for sure!
3,"As spies, they are incompetent","If they were real spies, or ""counter-terrorists,"" they would have been released from duty long ago. They are horrible at what they purport to do and that makes the show unrealistic. But I watch it anyway. MI-5 does it better, but at least 24 has an American accent. Later seasons do get better."
2,Not my favorite season of 24,The first season is too dark and violent. I liked the later seasons much better. Glad I didn't give up on it after this one.
3,Started off good,"Drags by doing every show in a one hour period. After a while you are like let's get moving, I follow what is going on.I just finished the first season and the second season jumps way past where the last one ended. Very strange how it starts because you don't know how anyone got where they are now."
5,Wanted to catch up,"We started watching 24 late and wanted to watch the complete series. So, we ordered a used copy of Season One. I was in great condition, no problems with any of the discs. It's hard to stop watching the episodes because they are so exciting! I recommend for 24 fans or for soon-to-be fans!"
2,Good story/good writer/bad editing,"This book is an excellent example of good story marred by the many grammatical, syntactical mistakes which should have been corrected, if not by the author, by the editorial staff of either Macmillan, its English publisher, or St. Martin's Press in this country. Wading through the zillion run-on sentences, as well as the same number of comma splices became so distracting, due to the fact that so many sentences and paragraphs had to be reread, that I ceased to care just ""who done it"" and turned to the book's final pages. This is too bad, since her last work of fiction (Cannaletto and the Westminster Bridge) was quite good indeed."
5,Excellent collection,"As usual, this is an excellent set of music. This album includes music from both Starday and King eras and is a good overall sampler of Moon's career.Although not as wellknown as Elvis Presley, there is no doubting the similarities between Moon and Elvis: both were very versatile singers, were regarded as the King of their chosen field, had countless imitators and derivatives and loved black music.This CD displays Moon Mullican's unique versatility: from oldtimey country like ""Wabash cannonball"" to a raunchy cover of Roy Brown's ""Grandpa stole my baby"" to ragtimey tracks like ""Ragged but right"" And ""Magnolia rag"" to originals like ""Trifling woman blues"", ""Pipeliner blues"" & ""What have I done"", Moon [to forgive the pun] shines throughout. No matter what the genre, he sings and plays with equal enthusiasm and ability and can effortlessly switch from one to the other at will."
4,Moon Revised,It had been years since I had heard these songs. Once you hear them you relive all the good times they brought. If you like old music and piano played to the fullest you will love this cd.
1,Don't bother.,"I bought it for the song Shoot the Moon which I heard on Pandora. I had great hopes to discover roots Texas Swing, but Shoot the Moon was the only hit and the cut was defective so I had to return it.Despite my disappointment with the music, service on the sale was stellar. Response to my concern was immediate. Communication with the dealer was concise and polite. The matter was settled promptly. I applaud Amazon and their partners."
5,Subtle and Enjoyable,"Upon first listen, I almost foolishly dismissed Broadcasting from Home as a disappointing follow-up to their self-titled debut. What I later realized, however, was that Broadcasting simply wasn't as accessible and easy-to-please as the tracks on their first record (a good thing).In time this one has grown on me quite a bit. I won't say that I enjoy Broadcasting MORE than their first record; rather, I enjoy Broadcasting in a DIFFERENT way. Whereas I do feel that the first album is more consistent, I find Broadcasting more challening listenting; the songs are more subtle, more sombre. Yes, there is the one infinitely catchy track, In the Back of a Taxi, but the others take time to digest properly. My favorite is Now Nothing, a song so spare yet so beautiful that it's haunting.Fans of ambient/minimalist music should find this offering quite solid. Newbies to the genre might want to start off with the self-titled debut."
5,Adds a modern flair !,I replaced a foyer light with this one by access lighting. I am very happy with the quality and ease of hanging. It glows beautifully at night with the addition of a dimmer (highly recommended). You will not be disappointed.
4,Our poor Oliver,"I read Love Story over and over and over as a young teen. I still read it often today. For years though I sat with my mother's original version- lime green hardback- never knowing there was a sequel until I stumbled on it at a flea market with my mom and aunt. They were shocked to find that I did not know about it- knowing how much I loved ""Love Story"". My aunt prepared me for disappointment....but she was wrong.Oliver's story is a gut-wrenching story about the pain and the empty life we often lead after a loved one leaves us too soon. Oliver's Story has no pretense of a happily ever after, and does not leave you with the rain clouds departing. Oliver lives the life we all might lead, absent the glowing Hollywood ending. He struggles a lot in this book, and although you are tragically sad for him, you know the ending is right."
1,Oliver's Story,The book was slow paced and boring. Was a very big let down especially considering how god Love Story was. Don't read it!
3,"good book but not very satisfiyng, something is missing","I read this book right after finishing Love Story, and think that Oliver's Story is more interesting than the first book of this sequel. But still, at the end I felt that there was something missing. He is alone again, and the whole ""good and misteriouse"" charachter of Marcie, too dramatically became cruel and unjust."
5,Great Case!!!,I purchased this case for my phone and I am very impressed with the quality. It is clear that this case is made from very high grade leather and will last for many years. When it comes to cases; Krusell is the leader. I will definitely purchase all of my cases from Krusell.
1,Not encouraged,"The information given is not enough to encourage me to buy this book or any other book that does not allow me to look inside, nor to rate it since I can not see its content. One should be able to look inside the book to make sure that what they are buying is what they need. I say this by experience. I purchased 2 books from you that I can not use beause all the bars are in Spanish. Given the fact that the computers we purchase in the United States have all the bars in English the book should so be written with the meaning, and an explanation of the function of each bar."
5,Classic Fripp & Eno - - The Trance - The Mood - The Feel,"To think that two men in a living room with two Revox A-77 2-track tape recorders looped together did this, Brian Eno looping and layering track after track, Robert Fripp and his Fripp Pedal sustaining guitar notes....and if you were ""in-tune"" the first time you listened to the original record and read the label, it said, ""HELP 16"", and if your dad had an old stereo that played 78's, 45's 33&1/3's and 16's, and you set the speed to 16 then you heard ""No Pussyfooting"" as Fripp and Eno intended......., so record the CD on reel-to-reel @ 7&1/2ips and play it back @ 3&3/4ips...You won't be sorry......"
5,Good stuff here.,"If you like Robert Fripp and if you like Eno, then this album is everything you should expect. Neither one of them is known for following established music formulas, and the two songs here live up to that. The first one is especially nice---a lot of space, a nice steady drone in the back. The guitar is instantly recognizable as Fripp's. This album is not as ""catchy"" as some of their other material, so if you haven't yet come to grips with subtlety, run home."
1,time has passed this by,"I have the original version of this album, but haven't played it in a long, long time. I sampled this remastered version and asked myself the question ""What does it say about a ""song"" if you can't tell the difference between the original version, and versions played backwards or at half-speed""? The answer I gave myself is; ""not much!"" Sadly, while important in it's day, this music is now nothing but a curio and a relic, of far more value to musical historians than people who actually listen to music."
4,"Don't get much simpler than this, nope...","Check the lineup: guitar. Synth. Pedals. Two Revoxes. That's it. Combine with Messrs. Fripp and Eno, and you get this oh-so-satisfying work. Only two works here, ""Swastika Girls"", and ""The Heavenly Music Corporation"", which really lives up to its title. Electronic drones slowly build as Fripp's guitar arcs and soars dramatically over the gradually-developing backdrop. The only thing here that I consider weak is certain aspects of ""Swastika Girls""; there's always been something about the squealy VCS3 loop that underpins the track that I've found irritating and distracting. Nevertheless, as first outings go, this is pretty amazing...but for _really_ amazing, one has to go on to the next release by the duo, ""Evening Star""."
4,NO KIDDING,"Enough has been said about this and ""Evening Star"", with NP being the more important of the pair, that little need be added. What's new with the reissues is the addition of ""Swastika Girls"" and ""The Heavenly Music Corporation"" in reverse, a seemingly too-naked innovation that still manages to provide a new appreciation for the melodic elegance of Fripp's solos (the Eno pads remain largely unaffected by the change in direction). The half-speed nugget is a nice acknowledgment of Tape, but mostly solicits a ""meh"" around the house. All that aside, the remastering here is a bit of a revelation. Hard to believe that an open loop ReVox could offer up so much hidden detail, but it does. The sonic re-examination reveals greater complexity and less sweetness than original vinyl and subsequent CD editions, casting the work in an even more favorable light -- freed of those initial impressions of mere ""prettiness""."
4,A Heavenly Trip,"This first collaboration between Fripp and Eno joins two vastly creative minds under the same banner, exploring new territory in studio techniques and expanding musical perceptions and borders, setting the stage for the dawning ambient genre, and even for the less ambitious 'new age' genre. There are many fine moments on this disc, as it urges you along on a spectacular journey of soundscapes and overlapping layers which seem to seep into every nook of your soul. I give it four stars because I think their second collaboration, 'Evening Star' is more successful, but this one is well worth investigating. 'Evening Star' is quieter in mood than this, if that helps you to choose between the two. At points, Heavenly Music Corporation makes me think of how the soundtrack to Blade Runner would have sounded if Jimi Hendrix had sat in on the sessions. Swastika girls is more tinkly and jangly and less to my liking."
4,Live fusion at it's best,"I have a good amount of Bill Bruford's work from this period, with his own band, UK etc. This recording is worth it just for the first two tracks, Hell's Bells (love that synth!) and Sample & Hold. The latter is absolutely incredible as it translates live better than I ever thought it would. Jeff Berlin's bassline is astounding! The other tracks I haven't mentioned are great too. The audio quality is pretty raw but that somehow adds to the charm of it. It sounds like a live album should. That is, capturing the performance on the night with no overdubs or studio trickery. An added bonus is the banter from Bill between tracks. I always find him amusing to listen to. I should also mention the contribution of Dave Stewart. His keyboard playing ranks up there with best of the prog genre and is criminally underrated. Recommended for fans of 70's instrumental fusion."
2,Boot Like Sound Quality,"I don't mind live recordings with ""iffy"" sound quality as long as the recording has some kind of revelation (rare live cuts,stuff that wasn't performed often, previously unreleased)to offer the collector of a particular artist. All of this is better heard on Bruford's studio albums. Really no need to get this if you have them."
2,Poor sound quality,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the line up, BUT, the recording is poor quality. It's a live recording and the overall sound quality is a reflection of the technology of 1979. My suggestion is for you to buy Bill Bruford's "" Master Strokes "". You will hear the same songs, with Allan Holdsworth on guitar and it's a studio recording, so the quality is superb. The live recording just drowns out the overall sound."
2,subpar recording,"this was a great band from back in the days when bruford smacked the snare rather than today's fiddly cymbal work (hint: bill, your progressive rock/fusion drumming was/is far more interesting than your attempts to be an old-time jazz-o), but the recording quality is appalling, fluff such as the sponsoring radio station's promotional announcements were left in whilst decent songs were poorly faded out early to fit the 33-1/3 disk layout, and i did mention the recording quality is appalling. spend your money on bruford's studio recordings, ""feels good to me"" and ""one of a kind"" rather than this lame excuse."
3,You guys must be deaf!,To the guys that think John Clark sounds like Allan Holdsworth you guys really must not listen to how Allan plays. It's only obvious to me and many of my friends that there is no similarity except that John Clark did Hammer ons. Have you guys ever listened to how Allan comps? Take two pills and go see AllanHoldsworth at the Baked Potato right away.The only guy I've ever heard that phrased a little like Allan Holdsworth was Scott Henderson on Jeff Berlins Vox Humana andthat Jean Luc Ponty album he did.Btw - are you guy's drummers? You sound like it with those comments!PS - Do you guys think Bill Connors sounds like Holdsworth?This is my least fav release of the 4.
4,The Unknown John Clark,"Great stuff, classic Bruford. I saw this lineup perfom at a club in Philadelphia PA, and frankly, if I'd have had a blindfold on, I would have indeed sworn that the guitarist was Allan Holdsworth. But I know Allan Holdsworth personally, and this guitarist was not him. Amazingly, this guy, John Clark, not only sounded exactly like Holdworth, but he did it all on a Gibson Les Paul--i.e., no tremelo bar!"
2,Not the original stereo mix,Better than the first mono release but still not the original stereo version of the album. Better stereo separation on the original album.
1,Deceptive picture of the advertised product.,"Looked like a good deal. When I received the filter in its box I thought the item was missing. What I thought was packing material was the filters - 2-6x6 black sheets of foam. The Ad pic shows 3 (2 black and 1 white) and says pack of 2. Don't think this is worth it, consider another product and company. Major rip-off."
5,THIS ONE DEFINITELY IS A MUST HAVE!,"LIL' SUZY, STEVIE B, FREESTYLE..... THEY'RE ALL ON THIS ALBUM. EVEN JONNY Z! FOR THE FREESTYLE LOVER'S, I RECOMMEND THIS CD. A MUST HAVE! FREESTYLE IS HERE TO STAY! BRiNG iT oN!"
2,"Good CD, no name brand to it.","I've lived in Toronto for 25 years. I have never heard of these songs or artists (on radio, clubs, etc.) The overall quality is very disappointing."
4,Get the Unrated Edition!,Beauty Betrayed Dvd Mia Zottoli Tracy Ryan Unrated Uncut Reg 1 Ntsc Spanish CoverForbidden Highway (Spanish Version with English Audio)
1,Disappointment,"My husband and I were quite diappointed with this movie. The same song was used throughout the entire video. By the time we finished it, we wanted to shoot the TV. The erotic scenes lacked credibility. Also, there was an exagerated amount of flashbacks, but to make it worse, most of the flashbacks were played in slow motion. This made the video seem longer that it needed to be. I definitely do not recommend this video to anyone."
3,Uneven ambient recording,"I loved this pair's work on ""The Pearl"". I found that album to be zenlike in its ""cut to the absolute minimum"" minimalism. A few notes of a lovely phrase, sometimes simply two or three chords, were treated to Eno's very tasteful electronic colorings and tonal landscapes. While very simple, it was never tonally predictable so that it could engage the listener for many repeated listenings. On ""Plateaux of Mirror"", I sometimes have felt that I was listening to one of those budget new age knockoffs that you find for sale in large retail outlets like Wal-mart. There is very little coloring here, so much so that I wondered what Eno's role was on this album. A few lovely pieces, a few so-so pieces that revolve around basic (and uninspired) progressions, and a few that sound as if they were Chopin without his melodic talent. The works here seem unusually busy to my ears-not contemplative as I had hoped. I found this inferior to the almost perfect ""The Pearl""."
3,More of the Same,Some proclaimed Ambient 3 to be the most boring album in the ambient series but seriously Ambient 2 is the most unexciting.Ambient 2 is just a remake of Ambeint 1 except now the tracks are shorter and more textured and seems more New age like. But the techniques are nothing to scream about ... unlike the rest of the ambient series which prop the listeners to challendge them to listen to music in a different way ... Ambient 2 is just the same givena refinement ... but still all fan of the series should complete their series just do not expect this to excite but instead treat this album as an extension from Ambient 1
5,Toto Cutugno-insieme,"Nice CD, good quality and very beautiful music. Toto Cutugno is my favorite singer. It was good that I was able to see the songs that are on CD, before I purchased it."
2,Not my favorite stories,I love the Little Rascals but the ones featured in this DVD are not my favorite. They are either sad or too slow.
4,Patrice Moncell is the best,Subway live juke joint jimmy king Patrice Moncell greit peopleand greit place.buy this dvd.tbilisi georgia gio vb data
5,Nice,"Flash cards are so old school, but some things just never lose their appeal. Bought some as a gift for some kids I was tutoring. They loved them."
3,Not as good as the first,"I enjoyed Ms. Gerritsen's first forensic thriller, ""The Surgeon,"" but this second, ""The Apprentice"" felt like a rehash of the first -- it even used the same serial killer for the bad guy (partly). This one just seemed to drag more. It also felt rather cliche to have a woman cop struggling to prove herself in the ""man's world"" of homicide detectives (but this could be because this book was published in 2002: so maybe it wasn't cliche back then). I mostly didn't like, and didn't understand, why FBI Agent Dean continually berated the main character, Detective Rizzoli. I thought maybe in the end the author would explain this (the agent was trying to bring out the best in Rizzoli? Or push her through a frightening case with ""tough love""?) but it was never made clear, so I was just left hating those scenes. I'll give Ms. Gerritsen's third book a try, but if she doesn't prove herself there, I'm done."
3,Another gripping and intense read.,"An adjective that seems to fit the first two books of Geriritsen's Rizzoli series: gripping. In this installment, it's gripping and intense. Again, the plot line gets a little creepy in parts. However, the author holds the reader's interest in a well-constructed story -- the writing is smooth and the characters are believable. It's a notch above the first book. Good suspenseful read."
5,You can't beat Tess for accuracy and terror!,"THE APPRENTICE-Tess Gerritsen-Review By L. A. MatthewsFrom BOOKS GALORE CLUBTHE APPRENTICE is chilling! What a ride! There was a lot of research done in order to create such realistic crime scenes. The descriptions of the autopsies are visuals that were hard for me to get out of my head! Excellent writing!A year after Detective Jane Rizzoli saw Warren Hoyt, serial killer, was put away, Boston is breaking out with more murders, only this time it's husband and wife victims. There is a clue that resembles Hoyt's MO but Jane is the only one who seems to see it. Clues lead the reader to suspect someone who works in the hospital. Suddenly something changes and only women are murdered. The Dominator has a partner and between the two of them the murder rate starts doubling. Things begin to point to a new victim being set up, Rizzoli herself.You can't beat Tess Gerritsen for accuracy and terror!"
2,Not her best work,"I have enjoyed Tess Gerritsen's work in the past but this is not representative of it. Pass on this one and read ""Gravity"", ""Bloodstream"", and/or ""The Surgeon"" instead."
2,The apprentice,"I had a very tough time getting into this book. Very slow and I found the characters to be very ordinary. In the end for me, this book was quite forgettable."
1,"Long and boring,,,,,,,,,","I loved ""The Surgeon"" so I preordered the Apprentice with high hopes. Have had it for 10 days and am still trying to work through the sludge. Jane Rizzoli as a lead in this book is all wrong in my opinion. She isn't likeable, has a chip on her shoulder, and isn't convincing in the role. She is simply too bland to carry a book. I didn't really mind her in the first book as she added color as a supporting character.""The Surgeon"" was a 4 star book that had a beginning, middle, and end. Why a sequel Tess ? 2 thumbs down."
1,Ugh,"I've had it with the Tess Gerritson novels. I'm tired of the constant gore fest. I don't know why so many mystery writers feel the need to go over the top with body counts and detailed, gross ways to torture and murder. I'm just reviewing this book, but my comments hold true for all but two books in the R&I series. Give me a mystery with good and interesting leading characters, and dial back on the sicko stuff, please."
3,Surgeon strikes again,This story moved along with suspense and kept me guessing. I was glad for once that my theory was wrong. Still not convinced I like this series. I'm still partial to the light and fluffy tv series.
3,Disturbing,"This is only the second book that I have read by this author, and I don't know if I will read the next natural progression of this plot line. The nature of these books is so graphic that I wouldn't even recommend them to anyone I know; unlike Patricia Cornwell. The suspense factor isn't there. It's more shock value and, in my opinion, disgusting. What would make an author think of a murder plot to involve this kind of behavior?"
1,Book Purchase-BAD decision,I have heard from so many people that Amazon Books was a wonderful place to buy books online. However it has been well over a month since my order and I have enquired of you twice about why I have not recieved my purchase nor heard anything from it. I am disappointed in your customer service and sure would like for you to resolve it. I truly do not desire to give your company a bad report to others.....Dan Tarno
2,Too similar to The Surgeon,"I love the Rizzoli and Isles TV show so I thought I would give the writer a try. I read The Surgeon and liked it even though, if I remember correctly, Dr. Isles did not appear in this book (or it was toward the end). So on to The Apprentice...which is a continuation of the same story and feels kind of boring. Not sure if I will continue with these books."
5,I love books!,"My latest used book purchase was made in October from Blue Buffalo in Arizona. I choose them because I thought that I might get them faster if the store was closer. I was right, and they arrived 5 days after placing the order. I ordered 3 books, all by Tess Gerritsen, and they were all in better condition than was promised. I have never been disappointed in Amazon."
4,Not bad!,"This was not, IMO, one of Gerritsen's best, but it was entertaining enough to keep me wanting to know how it would end. I look forward to reading more in the life of Rizzoli. She's become someone you tend to care about. Something tells me we haven't seen the last of ""the surgeon""."
3,disappointing!,"Tess is the only author whose books I buy on the release date at full price. Boy was I disappointed. You know how when you watch a sequel to a movie it is never as good as the original?! Well this book is no exception. I felt like she ran out of fresh ideas and had to come up with a book. So she changed a few circumstances, added another killer and reprinted ""The Surgeon"". Since the Surgeon escapes from prison towards the beginning of ""The Apprentice"" you have the same cop chasing the same killer as before. Boring. This is the first Tess Gerritsen book I would not recommend."
4,The Apprentice - Rizzoli & Isles 2,"I've read the surgeon and loved it, so I bought the Apprentice and now I am a Rizzoli & Isles addict! I love Tess Gerritsen, she keeps you interested till the end and you end up suspecting everbody. I didn't find it predictable at all. Very good reading!"
2,"""The Surgeon"" redux","Thank you, we've all seen quite enough of the superman serial killer. Dr. Hannibal became silly after a couple of reruns. The Surgeon (Hoyt) was barely OK the first time, but to reprise him is to reduce him to a joke and a blatant attempt to cash in on violence. This book isn't even close in suspense to its previous edition.I would also add that the author repeats information and no editor caught it--or the repetitions were included to fill out the book. Let this sub-genre die. Harris did it. Gerritsen does it. James Patterson just did it. And I'm sure there must be others. Let's hope it will end soon and we can get back to real characters and believable crime fiction."
3,What a let-down!,"I was SO looking forward to reading this book, a sequel of sorts to The Surgeon, one of the best books I've ever read, but this just wasn't that great. Not that it wasn't real written, it is. I think that Ms. Gerritson's writing style is among the best out there, certainly blowing Patricia Cornwell out of the water, but the ending was horrible, not even developed completely. Perhaps if the first book hadn't been so good, this one wouldn't have been such a let down, but I was looking forward to another awesome book, and I just didn't find it here."
5,Excellent,Started reading it and could not put it down. Looking forward to book 3. Not like the TV show but good.
4,Great Series,Actually read this entire series and really liked it. Easy read with great characters and good plot and lots of action at the end.
2,Given up on this series,"I bought the first several books of the series at a local bookstore (sorry, Amazon), so I probably don't show up as a verified purchaser, but I just wanted to say that I pretty quickly grew disgusted at the amount of graphic violence described in these books. I thought they were way over the top, and won't be buying any more."
3,not bad not great either,"the book was ok. Characters were well-developed, but it was not so exciting that I couldn't put it down. I agree with other reviewers who said that the time spent showing us Jane's emotional damage was way too long and way too boring. When the story just starts to get going it does abruptly end. I really wish there was more to the ending...although I liked the way it turned out..anyways...will read some of the authors other books out of curiosity."
3,Not bad but not really that good as the Surgeon,"There is not much of the thrill which was found in the Surgeon. The action is really boring and oh, at least the feminist rantings here are not quite as bad as in Cornwell's or Reich's books(which sent me gripping the books rather murderously). If you could call this marketing ""feminist thinking"" that is.Tess Gerritsen's not really anywhere as good as Thomas Harris' Silence of the Lambs or many of the other serial killer flicks out there. But at least it serves as a good and nice afternoon page-turner.However, in this book, she really botched up the pacing, the writing and compensated for it with really boring details. I hope that her next book, The Sinner, will be better. If you started the series with this book, try the Surgeon. The Apprentice is a true masterpiece, not in writing but in disappointing."
3,Good read,This was a very good book. I am impressed with the author's abilities. The books are nothing like the characters on the show!
5,"Good story to the television series which established the various characters. In fact better than the T.V. Series,","Got tot read the other books. Gives a good insight into the preconceived ideas of how the establishment regards women in basicly a male environment.Again well written. Gives some insight into the psychology of crime, criminals and the establishments. Story gives good development into how conclusions are arrived at and some unexpected twists."
4,good not great,"This is a good book and very fast paced, but i dont think it is as good as its lead in ""the surgeon"" (excellent). The surgeon grabbed you and didnt let go, while ""the apprentice"" grabs you and seems to try and not let go by doing the same thing as the last book. The fast pace keeps you reading, buit not on the edge of your seat. I do like the insight into the Warrens Hoyt's mind and the direction that this book could be leading, but the events that led to the joining of these two killers is not adequately developed."
3,Not my favorite by Ms. Gerritsen,"I'm not really sure how to write this review...or how many stars to give it...as it really depends on your tastes.If you read THE SURGEON and you expect to find the same suspense and twists...you'll be disappointed I think in THE APPRENTICE.If you read THE SURGEON and are interested in what happens to the characters after...as almost an epilogue...then you will like THE APPRENTICE. In THE APPRENTICE, although there are murders going on, the focus seems not to be on the killer in this book as it is on Detective Rizzoli and how she's really coping.Basically, I would not recommend this as a sample of Ms. Gerritsen's writing. She's much better at suspense and story telling than THE APPRENTICE. BUT, if you choose to read THE SURGEON, you would probably enjoy reading THE APPRENTICE simply to follow up with the characters."
3,over-hyped,"This book was way over-hyped, and didn't live up to it. It's repetitive, lacks character development, and doesn't get going till about 2/3 through."
4,The Apprentice,Tess Gerritsen writes very descriptive books about murder and serial killers - very interesting and quick reading at the same time.
4,Good not great,"This was an good escape book that promised a bit more psyhological development that it delivered. ""The Surgeon"", The Apprentice"" and Gerritson's last novel, ""The Sinner"" contain an interesting mix of a independent woman involved in resolving violent crimes against women. Not great but worth a read."
2,Readers wanting medical thriller will be disappointed,"I hope this isn't an indication of Gerritsen's changing interests, but this is primarily a police procedural with some but no where near enough medical details for medical thriller fans like me and my husband. I thought Bloodstream was her best, where I felt she skillfully combined a Stephen King-like understanding of teen life with excellent medical background. The Apprentice will appeal to you if you like Tami Hoag."
1,What happened?,"Hated it. The writing is awful; the story line [stinks]; the characters are psychologically shallow and inconsistent. Midway through the book, I lost interest in the story itself and could have cared less about what happened to its characters. I have better things to do with my life than to spend any part of it reading something as bad as this book. What HAPPENED to Tess Gerritsen?"
3,"Could have been better, could have been worse","This was an adequate escape book that promised a bit more psyhological development that it delivered. ""The Surgeon"", The Apprentice"" and Gerritson's last novel, ""The Sinner"" contain an interesting mix of a vehemently independent woman involved in resolving violent crimes against women. A psychological statement in itself.... While not her best effort, it was worth the time."
3,Not a bad way to spend a Saturday,"Sequel to ""The Surgeon,"" this mystery starts with a copycat murder following ""The Surgeon's"" (serial killer Warren Hoyt) m.o. to a tee. Of course, Detective Jane Rizzoli is brought in on the case. After all, nobody knows more about Hoyt than her -- she was nearly killed by him and was the cop who ultimately took him down. But when Hoyt escapes from prison and the murders escalate, it's clear that this isn't just your every day normal copycat killer. It's a team of two dangerous men -- and they're coming after Jane next.This was a fairly entertaining thriller. Better written than ""The Surgeon,"" but still not exactly what you'd call literature. Gerritsen still has an annoying tendency to overuse catchy phrases (okay, enough with ""coup de grace,"" already!). But hey, I was entertained and that's all I was really lookin' for with this one."
2,Just Started,I have just started this book and hope I don't have to read too many graphic autopsy reports. I didn't read The Surgeon but found I didn't have to as this book so far has made numerous references to it.It seems most of these stories are written by women and always have female M.E.s doing the autopsies?
4,The Trimmed Sails of Charon,"Great album, as is all the Scorpions' '70s output, IMO, but I partly bought this based on the previous reviewer's mention of the full version of The Sails Of Charon, which as of this writing isn't the case. This disc is the same as the cheaper domestic version. All track lenghts are identical between them. If having the original artwork isn't important to you (which admittedly it is to me), go for the cheaper black cover with the band's photographs."
3,Thin and weird sizing.,"This item is very thin. Light can easily be seen through it. I ordered a size to small and they were very nice about exchanging it. Of course, I had to pay postage to return it and then postage to get the new size. Almost not worth it. But BEWARE of the sizes. My first order was XL which was too small. My exchanged item was 2XL which was even smaller then the XL. Both had the right size numbers on the shirts, so what gives? I tried to match the other numbers on the 2XL tank top with Rothco site numbers and no such number. I guess I'll just donate this. It's now is too expense to exchange it and I'm STILL not sure I would even get a bigger size."
5,"Great for running, workouts, relaxing etc.","I bought this shirt a while back and am pleased with it. It's treated me well enough running here in minnesota's hot and extremely humid summers, so I think it's safe to say the shirt will work for whatever purpose."
5,Important book,"The book reads almost like a journal. It's an account of the end times we are living in now. The information given to the author is proving to be accurate, which is convincing to me since it was written 25 years ago. It made me question everything about Christianity, to strive to be what GOD wants me to be as a Christian, not some 'collection plate church peoples' idea of Christianity. I also think a visit to the website of the same name would be EXTREMELY helpful along with reading the book. There is lots more information. You just have to look for it."
5,WOW! Love it or Hate it,"Best book I've ever read! However, EVERYONE is going to be ""passionate"" about it. I rate it five stars, but many will hate this book because of its controversial nature and they will rate it much lower because of their disagreements. The author will make many friends and many enemies. He has drawn a line in the sand, and you are forced to stand on one side or the other. That said, you cannot deny that Mr. Mullen is an extraordinary writer. I read the entire book in one sitting. I've never done THAT before. Just could not stop turning the pages!"
4,What if this is true?,"Just finished War of the Angels. It is full of conspiracy and things I've heard and read before. Some would say it is self serving to the author, a way to prey on fear and make him a buck, I say, if there is a modicum of truth to what he says, EVERYONE should read it and be prepared."
1,This may be the goofiest book I've ever read,"DON'T BUY THIS BOOK THINKING YOU ARE GETTING A BIBLE BASED VIEW OF SPIRITUAL WARFARE. This book purports to be Christian and reflective of the Bible. Like tabloid magazines, this book uses Biblical scripture to make it appear legit. In fact, it is full of Mr. Mullen's dreams and visions and his stories conflict with scripture in massive ways.Instead, do a Bible study like ""Spiritual Warfare, Biblical Truth for Victory"" by John Franklin and Chuck Lawless. (...)"
4,If you like lounge music..,"Of course it would be unrealistic to expect that all the songs in an album would have the same quality. I am not going to list here which songs I liked and which ones I did not, since everybody has a different taste. But it is a good album to listen to, if you enjoy lounge music"
4,A Perfect Soundtrack to The Chill-Out Life..,"""Destiny"" has been all over the video waves for the past couple of months for a good reason, it perfectly encapsulates the sound, feel and over tone of a lazy, laid back Saturday afternoon. While the rest of ""Simple Things"" is equally impressive for the most part, the LP seems to run out of steam during the last couple of tracks and while things end on an equally relaxing note, a little more variation to the proceedings would have been welcome. Overall, this is a very promising album that serves as perfect, melodious background music."
5,Symphonic Perfection,"First heard the song ""Destiny"" on an MTV promo and I was sold on that song alone. I was pleasantly surprised when I heard the rest of the songs. Amazing album. Perfect to wind down with a glass of wine or set the mood for that hot date.Definately add this to your music collection."
5,Simply Beautful Downbeat and Folksy,Bravo...a must have for any downbeat fan...late night cocktails...or chillin with your special one
3,Not bad - Air's stuff is better,"A relative of mine, one who loves nondescript music, bought this CD and I got to listen to it. My reaction was a shrug and ""not bad"". It is technically proficient but I'd rather listen to Air, Kruder&Dorfmiester, Groove Armada, etc. This CD is pleasing to the ear but not very noteworthy."
3,Was okay,"I had listened to only one song on the album before purchasing. I loved that song. The rest of the CD was not bad, but it wasn't spectacular either."
2,It's ok but........,"Someone said this album was even better than the later gorgeous 'When It Falls' CD - it's not. It's ok, but for me it just doesn't hit the spot. Maybe it will take a few more listens......."
3,If you like that sort of thing,My family raved about this group when I went home to the UK and this is where I would say musical choices are definatley subjective.We all have similar tastes in music but this did not do it for me. Just too bland
5,More than Hot Air,"I like Air, but this is not just the Brit version of that French band. They see Air and raise them 100. If you like Cocteau Twins, High Lamas, Sundays, etc. this band is for you. They are so cutting edge you may need a Bandaid. Some of their tracks are misleadingly schmaltzy, but there is always an odd, original twist. This is grown-up, art rock with amazing staying power - the kind of album that delivers new revelations with each listening. And you'll be the first on your block."
5,"One of my ""Desert Island Disks""","Calming, tasty, rich, melodic, sexy. Can't imagine not having this in my collection. I turn to this for a pacific state of mind."
3,I've heard better... Waterlog outdoes this album by far,"When I heard this album, I was kind of bored by the formula. It is a good sound, no doubt, but I have heard much better. In fact, it seems they are trying to do what Waterlog does with their music and create an image from a sound. Waterlog is really good at making music come to life (like on Waterlog ""Brained Off Drugs"" album). But, maybe Zero 7 can take a lead from the urban instrumental masters. Waterlog is SICK!!!! Zero 7 is eeeehhhhhhhhhh...."
1,"barely cuts it as ""music""","What's up with this? It's just sound with no appeal, there's no melody or anything. Every song is boring and has one instrument pretty much, which isn't at all enough. This is so not a five star item, and there's something wrong if the average rating for crap like this is four and a half when the average rating for the king of electronica: Fatboy Slim is three and a half. This CD is too dull to enjoy, so don't get it. Don't even insult your ears by listening to it."
1,What a load of *****,"4 words: Don't buy this CD!Go for Air instead. It is embarrassing to have to listen to this blatant plagiarism. It's as if Air threw out a bag of tracks that they didn't want on their Moon Safari album and this is what the boys of Zero 7 picked up and called their own... An utter disappointment this is, and for every track I just felt more and more ill at ease until I had to switch it off before it was done playing.Should only be used as a coaster."
4,Simply Glorious,Zero 7 produce what can only be descibed as a jawdropping piece of material. From the first track 'i have seen' right through to the final note of 'end theme' you will be seduced into the extra ordinary bliss of the Ultimate Dilemma DJ heroes! The bizarre lyrics flow brilliantly with the unique voices of Sia and Sophie in 'distractions' and 'destiny' was an amazing debut from Zero 7. The only query i have is that apart from a few tracks the album sort of passes by with a blur as one track rolls into another.
5,"Very like air, but different",Love this CD -- also get Another Late Night -- the Roots Mauva remake is fantastic... along with Truth and Rights.cheers!
5,Smoke & sunshine,"For the past few years I've listened to chillout and have bought many, many compilations. When an artist stands out, I go and buy their full album. What makes Zero 7 stand out? Well, in electronic music and the rise of the bedroom artist, true musicianship is on the decline. It's become too easy to make bad music. Too much synthesizers, one-finger keyboards and drum loops, and not enough chords, acoustic instruments, melodies and weaving of parts into a whole. I love Thievery Corp, but to be honest, most of their songs are forgettable - a year later, I won't be listening to any of the tracks. St. Germain, on the other hand, gives the feeling that several people were jamming together in a studio session. Zero 7 is on another level above these two excellent artists, with their (guest) vocalists, atmosphereics, emotion, beautiful pads, chords, guitars, hard-yet-soft beats and musical sensibilities."
5,Definately tops MOON SAFARI,"Simple Things is one of the few albums you can listen to the whole way through without skipping tracks. It begins perfectly with the mellow 'I have seen' and continues this theme of smooth, chilled out grooves throughout the whole CD. My fave tracks are the awsome 'Distractions' and 'This world' but 'Destiny' and 'In the Waiting Line' come very close. I have to say that I do prefer this to 'Moon Safari', there aren't enough tracks that really stand out on that album for me, but I suppose that's just my opinion.Anyway, top marks to Zero 7 for a fantastic album!"
4,Soundtrack for Dreamscape,"When I first heard of this album, it came from the phenomenal video ""Simple Things"". After listening to the album in full, it takes the intrest I had from the video and runs with it. This is one of the few albums where my expectations were fulfilled after I bought into the hype. ""In the Waiting Line"" and ""Salt Water Music"" transcends normal pop junk and brings the music an nice warm feeling with a certain kind of cool. Words fail at this album...as they should. Turn it on and let the right brain take over."
4,"No great musicianship, but an interesting voyage.","Simple Things is exactly that. You won't find instrumental virtuousity here. As a musician friend of mine commented after hearing it, there is a lot of very simple ""noodling"" going on. So, if you're looking for complex jazz or performances for the ages, don't look here. What you will find, however, are interesting aural subtleties, well-crafted pop songs, and some nice vocals. It's better than background music, but not quite the kind of album that holds up terribly well beyond the very simple pleasures it provides. Sometimes, you need just that. Plus, there is an honesty to the lyrics that is refreshing. I find myself going back to this album time and time again, and that may be the biggest reason for the four star rating."
4,chilled out and lazy days soundtrack,"a great chilled out record, fans of air's ""virgin suicides"" OST will really love this CD. a must buy for fans of that great lazy day, and ""back to mine"" feel.very good stuff indeed."
4,cool as the other side of the pillow,"I would give this one 5 stars if I loved ALL the songs. You cannot review everything youu love with 5 though. This CD is something that all of us that love to groove/chill with a margarita on the deck at dusk with someone you love, either in person or in your mind. This etherial piece delivers variety, technical/techno virtuosity and a calmness that will fill you up with peace. It is one of those that you have to listen to unencumbered and without distraction the first time, and then your mind can open to something very different and without genre. Hope I conveyed that if you even THINK you are cool, you must own this.."
5,"Mature, evolved, soulful, varied","Mature electronica. Lyrics weren't just written to sound good, but have quite some meaning. Different, but not odd. More melancholic than cheery, but in context. Zero 7, as a band, is evolved."
4,Awesome album...especially the instrumentals,"I thought this was a great album....very haunting and chill. I have to say, though, that I lean more to the instrumentals on the cd, especially Red Dust and Give It Away. I Have Seen is my favorite vocal because it develops along a bigger theme than some of the other tracks. The best piece, bar none, is Likufanele with the African childrens chorus leading the way. It is very uplifting and different....almost a chill, downbeat version of a Paul Simon 'Graceland' tune."
4,Simply Lovely,"Like one of the other reviewers said, if you like AIR you should dig Zero 7. Le Femme D'Argent, the first track on AIR's seminal Moon Safari disc ranks as one of the best pieces of music I've heard. This album is full of melodic, beautifully composed electronic music. One of the most pleasant aural surprises I've had in a while. Pick it up."
3,Expected a lot more,"After hearing 'In the Waiting Line' on the Garden State OST, I kind of expected more great music from Zero 7. Apparently I set my expectations too high. While I'm not one to scoff at music without words, come on I listen to Nobuo Uematsu and Yoko Kanno's instrumental music all the time, this could of used more lyrics. The music was nice, but it wasn't good enough for me to want to listen to it without any words.So it was all right, but it wasn't spectacular, and this probably won't be to everyone's tastes. I recommend trying to borrow a copy to listen to first before purchasing to see if it fits your style."
5,Rare Find - Every Track is Good,"I found out about Zero 7 from watching Garden State. To my amazement I enjoy every track on this CD. The 3 vocals have different styles yet they mix so well together. I particularly enjoy listening to Sia in Distractions. Her raspy versatile voice range and the soul she puts into it really hits your emotions. At their website http://www.zero7.co.uk/ you can view a few of their live performances in Quicktime, not the highest quality, but better than Realtime. Sia sang Sommersault and I was just Wowed! I can't wait to see more of them. It's the best CD to listen too at he end of a work day, with a glass of wine!"
3,Hype Alert,"Similarities aside, this is mediocre lounge music. Yes, they sound like Air (bordering on copywrite infringement), but unfortunately for me it's a side of Air I don't like: saccharine syrupy vocals layered onto slow melancholy pop. It would be OK were it not for all the praise attached to this album, but there are so many better, more innovative artists who go totally unnoticed. And that singing really just annoys me to the point I won't even keep this one around. Be warned."
3,There are many better than this,"I had heard much praise bestowed upon this album and unfortunately, it is not deserved. The comparisons to Air are valid, both having spacey tracks with lilting voices, but this album just doesn't deliver. It's pleasant, nice, and beautiful, but (with the exception of a few tracks) has nothing memorable. If you dig Morecheeba, Air, Massive Attack, Thievery Corp and the like- this may be your bag baby, but I would gamble that those albums will rank higher on your chart than ""Simple Things""."
1,Not very happy...,"Though I did receive my order quickly, Im not happy with the poster at all. Apparently I was wrong to assume these posters would be the same size as other posters I have ordered, but they were not. They are too large for standard poster frames and now I will have to buy expensive custom frames to fit them. Amazon should have posted the details of the posters. Dont let this happen to you, these posters measure 32"" x 38"""
5,trigger points of pain,"These are highly valuable resources for all doctors, physical therapists and massage therapists for both diagnostic and patient educational purposes."
2,Meh,Could have drawn the muscles underneith. It doesn't even have all of the muscles like supraspinatus and infraspinatus which are key players in should movement/pain. Don't buy. Mine was a bit damaged in the mail. Paper is thin/crappy also crappy lamination job.
4,Excellent documentary on D-Day and last months of World War II,I think anyone looking for information on D-Day and the last months of World War II will enjoy this CD. I have other CDs on this subject and I rate this one as one of the best. Buy it.
3,It's an okay movie.,"The problem is that nothing ""Yu Yu Hakusho"" should just be okay. This is the only Yu Yu Hakusho thing that I would give a rating to that is less than a four. It is more like a direct to video episode than a movie.Like most people said, there is no humor, though the action is good. I didn't like the story a whole lot. Though people have said that this takes place between the Holy Beats part and the Rescue Yukina part, I wouldn't say that this is part of the actual storyline. About all of the Yu Yu Hakusho episodes were better than this. Sure, I was entertained by this and am glad that I did see it, but I would hope for alot more out of Yu Yu Hakusho."
4,Its an Ok movie.,"As a hardcore Yu yu hakusho fan I found this an Ok movie, the action was fairly boring (running, flipping, atacking, more running and flipping and geting wounded). The voices are different from the cartoonnetwork version, and they call Kuwabara Kuwahara!? some high points for me were Botan geting hit by lightning (she desserved it for being so Preppy all the time),and learning more about Kurama's past. For Kurama fans (me included) there is a seen where he is in a lake (with no shirt!) The subtitled version was better then the dub in my opinion. Rent or borow it before buying it."
4,a kraze 4 anime!,"I thought this movie was really great. being a HUMUNGO yu yu hakusho fan, I really enjoyed it. I would recommend this DVD to people that already know a little bit about yu yu hakusho, since the character introductions aren't that well developed. It took some difficulty to adjust myself to the voice changes, but it wasn't all that bad. Although I like Botan, I must admit: seeing her get defeated once in a while really isn't that terrible. As usual, I thought Kurama was the coolest, Kuwabara the stupidest, Yusuke most sarcastic, and Hiei the most sharp. Although the plot wasn't the best it could've been, I think the makers of this movie really outdid themselves, and I'd like to thank them for that, so, here goes: ""THANK YOU!!!"" I hope you will enjoy this movie as much as i did, and until then keep looking for some more kick-butte anime!!!"
4,"Excellent Dvd, Stupid Voice Actors.","The movie is great, following a new plotline where Botan has to protect a power sphere of the netherworld from getting into their hands. She falls unconcious and eventually is kidnapped by Yakumo, the king of the netherworld. Several fights and a good plot fill this movie, but there is one major problem... THEY DID NOT USE THE VOICE ACTORS FROM THE SHOW ON CARTOON NETWORK!!! Kuwabara, pronounced Kuwahara in the film, actually sounds some intelligent! Kurama's sounds close enough, Hiei isn't nearly as sarcastic, and Yusuke's is deeper, not filled withas much self confidence as before. Purchase this film if you love Yu Yu Hakusho and don't mind the difference in voice actors."
4,"sooooo, you like anime?","ahem* i bought this cool dvd. And i enjoyed it but one thing that really bugged me a whole lot, there darn voices, man! Yeah,I know they are in high school, but why change their cool butt kicking action voices??! Anyways, thats one problem I had with this dvd...Lots of violence and some profanity. Kuwabara i think cussed the most! yeah, I enjoyed seeing Botan getting beat up! heheheh...I course I'm a yuu yuu hakusho fan! I especailly loved the number 7 (Kurama's showdown)part, for all u KURAMA fans out there! drool* ahem* As i was saying,their voices were the only thing that annoyed me the most! And well, you'll just have to buy yu yu hakusho the movie to find out. ooooooo!!! one more thing, kurama's voice? not uh...I like the tv show voices better...bye!"
1,Poltergeist Report - A big waste.....,"This movie was HORRIBLE, ... I rented this, on the back of thebox it sounded awesome, and when I sat down to watch it, it was sooooboring, the plot is weak, and they skip around too much, it becomes confusing, and a lot of the attacks and dialouge are plain stupid, the fight scenes are very boring, and they do not let you know what is going on, they talk about these five things, and the whole movie revolves around them, and without explaining it, they expect you to understand it. Just dont waste you time, or money on this. Buy something else such as Ninja Scroll, or Ghost in the Shell, both great movies."
2,Mediocracy at it's best.,"I don't believe this. It's bad enough that the show went straight downhill after Yuske came back to life and basically turning into another DBZ/ Saint Seiya Tournament type show, but now this? I expected a lot from this movie. I figured they could come up with an interesting story that was above what they do in every episode of the T.V. show, but they didn't. It's just more shoujo action. One rediculous fight after another with some of the most horrible back ground music I've ever heard. The only thing keeping this from getting one star is the animation. The animation was handled very well and didn't just look like another episode of the show. If you're a fan of Yu Yu Hakusho, you'll enjoy this. But if you're looking for a an anime that actually requires the least ammount of though, watch anything else."
4,It was pretty good,"I like Yu Yu Hakusho alot, so I am kind of biased. The story here was good. Boton's purpose was much more important than having her awake, in this case. The fighting scenes were what you should have come to expect from Yu Yu Hakusho, A+. So why is this rated 4 stars? I consider the TV series to have some of the best english voice actors for an anime series, and this movie certainly doesn't have them. Hiei's voice was suprisingly good, but the others were alright or bad."
3,Call me when FunImation redubs it the RIGHT way...,"I bought this purely to have the entire YYH collection; entire series and both movies. To be brutally honest, I can NOT listen to the English version. I turn on the subtitles and mute the TV. Hearing the so-called ""actors"" on this gives roughly the same feeling as hearing nails being dragged down a chalkboard. As other reviewers said, they have NO emotion in their lines, they've changed the dialogue and screwed the original meanings, most sound NOTHING like the english cast YYH fans are used to from the series, and they didn't even get the names right... *Cough* Kuwahara *Cough*If you want to see ALL of YYH, including Kuronue, who can only be found in this movie, buy it, but DON'T expect much from the English cast. As for me, I'll leave it on my shelf and continue to pray that FunImation redubs both movies in the future."
2,"YYH is great, but this movie really sucked","The voices, the freakin' voices, they are so horrible. The original voices are awesome, why did they change to these new crappy ones. I love the Yu Yu Hakusho episodes, but this movie just can't live up to the show's greatness. It started with a great concept, but the voices combined with what ended up being an incredibly corny script totally ruined it."
3,Read the Manga...,"Yeah, subtitles would have been much better... I love the manga YYH, but if you don't know anything about the series I don't recommend the OVA... Anyway, the voices weren't *that* bad, except for the fact that Hiei sounded like John Lennon or something.... That was odd... I hope this helped...?"
3,Okay Yusuke.,"I was a bit disappointed. This movie did not live up to the series. It was good, and an addition for any fan's collection, but not a good watch for those new to Yu Yu Hakusho.I would suggest that you watch the series collection before this movie. It'll make more sense."
4,"Good, but disappointing","I am a fan of Yu Yu Hakusho, the dubbed version. As a fan of the English dubbed series, this movie had its disappointing aspects. None of the voices were the same as in the English series, and the English dialog seems awful ""cheesy"" and not up to the English dub's normal standards. So if you plan on buying, you should know this."
3,So So,"This movie was entertaining. It was interesting to see a new world added to the Human, Spirit, and Demon world. I would have liked to see another character from the show come back into the plot since the movie format doesn't have enough time to really develop new characters very well. I thought it would have been awesome if the younger Toguro came back and helped fight the villain. I thought that would have been awesome since I'm pretty sure he got banished to the same place where the villain was from before he eventually would cease to exist. Anyway, a fun movie, just didn't have the depth of the series."
2,"Not worth your money, but worth watching.","I actually sort of liked this movie [...]. The story was pretty weak, it had a good concept but the whole ""fight battle after battle after battle until you fight the main guy"" idea wasn't really a good execution. And the voice acting, oh my the voice acting. Its quite bad. There are a couple barable ones in there, and actually the villain has a pretty good actor, but a lot of the main characters are just [...], especially yusuke. As far as action goes, I love it, its got some good fight scenes. That is the only redeeming quality to this movie [...]."
3,Not bad,"It was an ok movie, Hiei made it watchable and it was absolutly rockin' in some parts. ( mainly the parts with Hiei) But sometimes the voices were really bad...I mean bad, and during those times I was sitting there going why didn't I get subtitles? Why! Why!"
5,And so it begins...,"...Yet another anime for me to be thoroughly obsessed with. And here I thought the Outlaw Star wave had me completely taken over! This movie got me completely addicted to hunting down as much YuYu Hakusho as possible. The animation is GORGEOUS. It flows smoothly, and the character design is awesome (if ya like dead sexy men, then GET THIS ANIME). The music is just plain amazing. In fact, I heard a song before I watched the anime and that's what got me interested, as well as a nagging friend... The plot is great. I had no idea who any of the characers are, but i got a basic idea of who everyone was just from watching the movie (Except for Botan... just go online to figure her out like i did). All I can say is, GET THIS MOVIE!!"
4,this movie is way better than it seems,"I know alot of people think this movie isn't interesting but I think it's one of the best. It doesn't explain alot of the plot as to why the characters do what they do or what connection they have with the Spirit World. Non-the-less, the battle scenes are very well animated and I think the dubbing voice actors were better than usual. I haven't seen the subtitled yet though I want to. I bet it's just as good or maybe better. I reccomend watching Yu Yu Hakusho: The Movie dubbed and subtitled by AnimeWorks. It gets you into the mood although with the bad guys they treat you like a 6 yr. old -_-'. Anyway, I highly recommend this movie. But if you dont like characters with secret pasts and stuff, dont watch it ^^"
5,Buy this video cause you need it,This is one of the best videos I got I picked it up by accident and bought it then all I knew was I was lucky I'm keeping this video and no I'm not loaning it out
1,What are people thinking rating this a 4 or 5 Stars?,"First, let me just state here that YuYu Hakusho is my favorite anime of all time. No matter what new stuff I watch my heart comes back to this animation.On this note, I have no idea who is rating this. I'm finding more and more that you can no longer rely on people who rate these animations on any sites. This movie was awful; even on the Japanese version; and I'm not talking about the English voice actors. The story plot was terrible and worst of all characters like Kurama and Hiei seemed weak and spoke, in one case, in a way that their characters wouldn't. It was overall bad that I sold it back. For someone who loves YuYu Hakusho it was not easy, but I knew I would never watch it again because it tarnished the characters I grew to love over the course of the series. If there was a 0 Star I would ahve chosen that."
2,What did they do?!?!?,"I think that manga corps didn't dub it right. They screwed up all of the voices. I'm sure that there is a reason for it, but they killed it! Hiei was ripping out his Jagan eye every minute, and never turned demon. Once you get past the little flaws like that, the movie is actually ok. The plot is good and all. The scariest thing is this: Kuwabara actually sounded intellegent! o.O"
4,Basic Sailing by M. B. George,"An excellent first book to read. It covers all the key topics in simple language using simple, clear illustrations. It's a quick read that prepares the beginner to understand and appreciate more complex treatments."
5,The Answer To A Prayer...,"This disc should be required listening in every music school in the country. Sure, there are some less-than-polished moments, but it's such a vibrant album...the raw edges just give it that much more character. This is what real voices sound like, ladies and gentlemen, before microcircuitry took the place of talent in the recording studio. I still get a chill right before the Sisters make their entrance...""Whoooo! Here come the Pointers!"" yells one of the gals. Indeed.The precise stereo placement of the 4 (yes, there once were FOUR Pointer Sisters; come back, Bonnie...all is forgiven!) individual voices amplifies the energy of the numerous scat solos. Quite a lot of humor, as well--The ""Old Songs"" medley still cracks me up. One of my favorite albums of my youth, and now it's on CD.Prayers ARE answered."
3,"Update (no ""Only Time Will Tell"" but more live!)","10 music videos with remastered sound:Don't Be LateCareful Where You StepOn the LooseWind Him Up (live audio, mix of live video w/ original video)CatwalkFlyerWhat Do I KnowAlways There (unreleased, created for Saga's 25th anniversary)Money Talks7 live songs filmed on the 'Heads or Tales' tour!The PerfectionistCompromiseIce NiceTimes UpScratching the SurfaceDon't Be LateYou're Not Alone3 bootleg videos shot in the United Kingdom:It's TimeHumble StanceIntermissionPlus 2002 interviews"
4,A nice collection....,"After what seems to have been longer than it should take to put together a DVD, I must say that, as a fan, this was worth the wait. This is not the best produced, slickest, most high-tech DVD you'll ever own, but as a fan, it's a great addition. The interviews provide an insight into the guys in the band as just that - regular guys doing what they love. No VH1 where-are-they-now innuendo, just folks telling stories about high points and not-so-high points in the journey through a career. And the collection of the music videos from over the years is nice, and rounded out by a couple ""live bootleg"" videos. Having seen these guys both in North America and Europe, the videos capture the live performance pretty well. Will it win at ""Cannes?"" No. But as a fan, it's a nice collection of artifacts."
4,I'm Glad I took a Chance,"This DVD has opened my eyes to a band that I dismissed after getting ""burned-out"" on hearing On the Loose countless times on MTV back in the day. Although some of the videos are dated and hard to watch, there are some real keepers. And the concert...this is the part of this DVD package that has really turned me on to going back and exploring Saga's back-catalogue...The Perfectionist, Ice Nice, Compromise, Humble Stance, You're Not Alone and of course, Don't Be Late...these are very good Prog/pop songs---I thought I had a pretty complete musical library...the old prog,the new prog...so how have I and so many others missed out on this wonderful band? I don't know, I'm just enjoying this DVD and looking forward to digging deeper into this new found treasure of sorts! So if you are like me and hesitant to fork over the money for this one...Just do It(you'll probably find yourself thrilled with it). Jeff"
2,Old footage? why?,"I have not bought this disc (yet) I most likely will because I'm an old fan of SAGA. I can't believe thought that they would actually release old video concert footage if that's what people are saying. I'd expect a 5.1 DTS mix and videos that were possibly shot within a year or 2 of it's release, not from the 80's. I mean come on I hope they can make another DVD with more recent technology. I'm guessing that perhaps SAGA thinks they themselves have lost the magic from yesteryears.But nonetheless I will buy it. I remember growing up in Luxembourg seeing 2 live concerts and having a great time. I even had a live video concert on VHS that was broadcast on a German TV station back in the 1980's. I wish I had kept it.. now I can get the DVD and still feel like I was there again (flashback, oh yea)"
5,The LOST album,"A list of the all-time top rock&rollers; came out recently(?). It had the KING in the number 3 spot behind the Liverpool lads and Robert Zimmerman. Zimmerman??? I almost died.....laughing! Without the King, all of those other lads would be out there somewhere digging ditches.That then-RCA sat on this album for over 25 years has, by now, been well-documented. Well-documented, as well, is the fact that Elvis could ""sing all kinds"". These 15 tracks are further proof of Elvis's incredible ability with a song, any song, be it Chuck Berry's MEMPHIS, TENNESEE or ASK ME, a ballad of italian origin, both included here.Non-fans keep trying to knock The KING off his throne, to no avail. Elvis will ever be the King. This album is but another great example.Get it while it is still available."
5,Great Book!!!,That is like my favorite book. I read it over and over again. Even though I am only 8 I hope some day I own it. I also hope you like it too!!!
2,NOT the DVD you are looking for to learn new rytms!,"I recently bought this DVD together with ""Master Drummer Series: Thione Diop Teaches Djembe and Dunun Rhythms of Senegal"", as they both had great reviews. I'm a beginner and I was looking for a DVD that would teach me some different rythms, preferrably in an easy ""play along"" way.If that is what you too are looking for then I would really recommend you to skip this DVD and go with Thione Diop's DVD!! The ""Remembering How to Drum: Djembe Technique"" was a big dissapointment and I can't understand how it has gotten such good reviews (even if there is just eight reviews) - are you friends of the producer??"
2,not very useful,"I felt the author was showing off his skills but not teaching much. Other than the very basics, you will not learn much about rythms and technique from this DVD."
4,avante garde prog,"Much avante garde prog music on the Cuneiform label tends to be very fast-paced and frenetic sounding (Doctor Nerve, Present, Thinking Plague, etc.) Such is not the case with Smokin' Granny. They have a slower groove going on that sounds like one of these bands took a muscle relaxant. By way of comparison they sound to me like NeBeLNeST or a relaxed Boud Deun. The average person on the street is going to think that this music sounds ""strange"". There's little melody or song structure. Songs start and then end abruptly. The music sounds random and improvised at times. I have a large catalog of albums and nothing else yet sounds quite like these guys. A 5/5 for originality, and 4/5 overall."
4,Good stuff,"The disc is just what one might expect from good , solid mainstream musicians , real fun music . Anything Marty Grosz is involved in is usually fun !"
5,An Great Cd,Niow my son has all of this groups alumbs on cd's. It has all of the hits so if you enjoyed 80's country music or is a big fan of this group than this cd is just for you. Lois Banks
5,Healing Music,"I really can recommend this album as one of my favourite CD's. The outstanding beauty of this music, the healing and relaxing sound of Laraaji's harp is somehow incompareable. Listen to this music when you soul needs some rest, switch your CD player on ""repeat"" and let the vibes of these sounds fill you rooms.No.'s 4+5 are the highlights."
3,Least favorite of the Ambient series...but still OK,"I love Brian Eno's ambient/instrumental music. His Ambient series is really great to zone out to. This particular album was produced and influenced by him but the artist is Laraaji. The music/sounds are a bit repetitive and sometimes annoying on this one. I have to skip some of the tracks because they are loud and repeat a cycle of notes that almost seem manic. It is interesting to listen to and some tracks are better than others...but I prefer Ambient 1, 2, and 4 more. I would sample it first before buying. I didn't. I assumed that it was Brian Eno's work and not that of another artist."
3,Ambient? No way!,"Ambient music is meant to create ambience, right? Well, what is this album of frantic, hyperactive dulcimer music doing in this series? The only place that this would be appropriate ambient music for would be an assembly line! Simply impossible to relax to as it is unnervingly energetic and noisy. I agree with the reviewer below that this is the worst of the ambient series."
4,"Pleasing, fast-paced thriller!","A pleasing, fast-paced thriller that The New York Times Book Review described as ""a competent piece of work about an artist whose life is threatened."" While there might not be anything that special about the plot or characters, it's the lively writing that makes this book so engaging. Originally published by Avon in 1950 (the author using the name Edward Ronns), this 1964 version by Macfadden Books actually manages to outdo Avon with a fabulous lurid cover that is just as alluring as the writing itself."
1,TERRIBLE HEAT SHIELD,"THE FILTER IS GOOD, BUT HEAT SHIELD IS GARBAGE, IT DOES NOT BLOCK OFF THE HEAT FROM THE ENGINE, THERE ARE TOO MANY GAPS IN THE SHIELD, IT IS WORTHLESS, TOTALLY HALF ASS AND RETARDED. I DRIVE A NICE BMW 540 AND I GET THIS CRAP, SO UPSET RIGHT NOW. I SHOULD HAVE CALLED SIGHNATURE MOTORING FOR A CUSTOM HEAT SHIELD, ONE THAT COMPLETELY SEALS OFF THE HOT AIR FROM THE ENGINE, NOT WORTH 250-60 DOLLARS!!!! BUYER BEWARE!!!"
5,Excellent ambient music,"I just discovered this album and I enjoy it very much. The style is very simple but unpredictable. It is ideal for reading or quiet times but it also is interesting enough to listen to for its own sake. Minimalistic without being repetitive. If you like ""Music for Airports,"" this will be a very nice addition to your collection. I buy this music for stress reduction. I fell into a relaxing nap on the first listen!"
5,Probably the best Budd/Eno team-up album of all time,"Even more than ""Music for Airports"" and ""Plateaux of Mirror"", this album is the definitive collaboration album from the Budd & Eno archives. A groundbreaking classic of the ambient genre, this disc just gets better with time, especially in an era when the New Age and ambient genres have been overrun with imitators and dilettantes.Subtle, gorgeous piano and synthesizer work features throughout, with a richness and emotion that is hard to find on other ambient albums. When it comes to ""relaxation"" tunes, this one has the field beat, and I've spent many an evening, in bed, under the stars, with my wife or alone, letting the quiet, spare beauty of this disc spirit me away from the troubles of the everyday world.Anyone seeking to find the roots of true ambient should look no further. Budd & Eno were doing it long, long before most others, and they were doing it with a style and a gentle grace that has come to typify their collaborative efforts."
5,Zen music...,"I was first exposed to the work of Harold Budd through this breakthrough album ""The Pavilion of Dreams"", which proved to be a fantastic cure for insomnia and became a favorite of our baby while he was still in his mom's belly. With ""The Pearl"" I am confronted with a piece of music that leaves me speechless every time I listen to it. From the first bar of ""Late October"", all the way into ""Still Return"", this is an album that invites you to sit back and contemplate the world around you, to shut your eyes and let yourself go. Ambient at its best, nothing less could be expected from two of the genre's maestros. This, simply put, is Zen music..."
3,"Soothing, beautiful, if a tad bland","The Pearl must be a contender for the most soothing record of all time. The production is lush, the playing (mainly piano) infinitely gentle, the tunes pretty but always discreet. On the downside, it lacks the epic scale, rich atmosphere and haunting melodies that make Budd and Eno's other collaboration, Ambient 2:the Plateau of Mirrors, so poignantly unforgettable. The songs on The Pearl blend and blur, drifting by in a lazy blink of the eye, but their lack of individual identity pushes the record a shade too close to the ""relax with whales"" end of the Ambient spectrum."
3,MP3 player,"I recieved the mp3 player in a timely manner. It was not what I expected, I thought it had an FM radio on it. I would recommend this product to middle school children. I will buy from amazon again."
2,Not worth the money,"You are probably looking at this item and thinking the same thing I was thinking before I bought this: It's very cheap, doesn't look so bad, and what can possibly go wrong. Boy was I wrong. After the first week, the garbage headphones that it came with stopped working. After a month, the sound kept on going on and off and stopped working the next week. It is also very hard to navigate around this thing. Save yourself the time and money and buy yourself something like the SanDisk Sansa m230 which is a little more money, but probably worth it. Now I'm stuck with a broken mp3 and I am going for the m230. Trust the reviews. The people that gave this a good review, probably rated this a day after they received their mp3 player. I should have trusted the reviews before buying this. Don't get stuck with this like I did. I only rated this 2 stars, since it lasted 5 weeks."
1,"Just like renting. Pay your money, use it for six months, and then it's gone.","I've owned mine for awhile, and I enjoyed it for six months. Then it gave out. It refuses to power up, even with a new battery. It powers up when you plug it into a USB port, but then you find out that it has lost all of the data and its formating. I've reformatted and put new audio files on it, but they don't stay very long. Not recommended."
1,Mp3 Player,"I'm sorry. You don't have to post this review. I recieved the Mp2 Player and was shocked to find out that it wasn't what I wanted. It was complicated and no where near what I thought it was going to be. I wanted a recorder, where you have ""REC, PLAY, STOP, REW, FEW."" I got this thing and it has an ear piece that I never saw on the web site before purchase. It was a horrible buy. It's sitting here. I won't use it. I think this might be the last time I buy from Amazon. Thank you for the chance of review. Have a nice day."
3,"It's Okay,But.....","I'm 13 and I had bought this with my Christmas money in hopes of having my first mp3 player...but, when I gave it to my dad to put the program that came with it that's supposed to make you be able to put music on it and all it came with was an upgrade for the program.Then, my dad went online trying to find a link and when he clicked on the link it had a black screen that said YOU ARE AN IDIOT with a scary clown voice and i started crying cuz i was dissapointed or something and my dad eventually figured out how to put music on it without the program cuz he's a whiz at that stuff so... remember that if you try to buy it"
1,They don't last,I purchased three of these this summer.I am now back to purchase something different.For the MP3 part :: One died quickly and quietly.The other two took awhile.When you first get them they work great but after awhile they start to act up. At first it is little glitches in the interface and then they just up and stop working. You can replace the battery and do a reset but that only works temporarily. It must be some tiny part or something that wears out.The voice recorder and as a Jump drive they are still working today.If you are buying as a JUMPDRIVE and VOICE RECORDER Go for it. The MP3 part of the deal is not worth the time or money!
4,Not Bad For The Price,Holds more music than you need for a walk around the block or where ever. A little hard to navigate through the music list and controls. Overall a good deal for the money.
4,machspeed trio is the best,"i love this mp3 , the price is very convient , me and my wife purschased it , and then we got one for our son , my mother in law got one , so did my wife's aunt. the point i am trying to make is you can't lose with machspeed.it plays good , the headphones are not that nice , if you like your music loud , then you should buy new headphones. i love this mp3 player , it holds about 110 songs, depending on the size of the music . it has nice featuresyou may need to play with it , just to get the feel of the features.i have no problem with it. the manual doesn't explain much. i played around with it just to understand the features. overall i am happy with it. the battery life is decent. it averages about 20 hours on one 1 AAA battery. for the price , you wouldn't be dissapointed"
2,under $20 and still costs too much,"I thought buying this from Amazon at $24.60 instead of used for $17 plus shipping&handling; would make a difference ESPECIALLY since they offered a player with a RECORDER!the player I revcived had a recorder but i neber use it.Plus the so-called ""10-hour"" battery life is really four-hours and 47 mins.Song capacity is more like 75, even with small files.Not the first time I've wasted money on Amazon items, but it will be the last!!!!!"
2,Not very good,"At times it doesn't work right. You have to play with the buttons, it acts like the battery is dead, but I tried 3 different new batteries."
3,great product..great price,"We bought this for our 9 year old nephew. It is nice looking, easy for him to use and seems to be of a great quality."
3,It gets an A for B-rated!,"I wouldn't call this the greatest B movie ever made, but it does have it's moments. Such as [low-budget] effects and bad acting. The stories told aren't that bad, with a bigger budget the movie could have given us horror fans justice. But it's based off of the comic book by the same name so it's just a little tribute. the best part of the movie is a cameo the the greatest punk band ever The MISFITS! If you liked the Tales From The Crypt, Creepshow 1 or 2, or Tales From The Darkside check it out. Or in my case bad B-movies, I dug it."
1,What a waste of money.,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting was horrible and that is not too surprising. Kevin Spacey couldn't have delivered these lines convincingly. The only reason I gave it one star is the forrest ranger was creepy. He was the best part of the movie. I like teenage horror flicks, but the only horror for me here was the loss of some hard earned money."
3,"Scarey, for 14 and under sitting around a campfire","Just right for the past holiday, Holloween........Creepy, scary (for kids and grown-ups that want to be kids......"
2,Campfire Stories,"me and my friend went to the video store today to rent a horor movie, and found campfire stories. we have been through all the halloweens, freddy's, leprachauns, and children of the corn. im not sure what appeal campfire stories had, but we rented it. we watched it and the camera angles were terrible. seemed like an extremley low budget film. its starts when two guys are driving out to a camp to meet friends(i guess...) and they meet a girl whos car supposedly broke down in town. the girl tells them that she saw campers in the forest so they all go in search of the fire only to find a creepy park ranger who begins to tell them camp stories. there are three stories all around 15 minutes long. although production was terrible, and the author left many un answered questions, the end was a great way to wrap it all up. overall id haveto give this movie a 5 out of 10(10 being the best)"
4,"A Fun, Scary Little Thriller!","I just watched the DVD of ""Campfire Stories"" featuring babe-o-licious Jamie Lynn Sigler of HBO's ""Sopranos"". This movie rocks! It's like a ""Tales of the Darkside"" for the 00's. And David Johannsen is creepy too! This is a fun popcorn movie, something to enjoy with a date or with friends. Watch out for the creepy climactic ending!"
1,Grade of F even by B movie standards,"This movie is just plain bad. Not ""bad"" as in ""It's so bad let's get drunk and make fun of it"" - I'm talking ""bad"" as in I would have preferred to have my fingernails yanked out by a wet mongoose ""bad""."
1,trash,"this movie is not even worth renting, trust me. the entire crew of this movie put so little effort into all aspects of production that it is completly unwatchable. The plots are simple and childish(essentialy poorly acted and directed ""Are you afraid of the dark?"" sequences."
5,Laughter and tears!,"I loved this book. If you know anything about growing up in Queens, New York in the late 60's you'll totally relate! I loved the authors vivid portrals of her characters! A thoroughly enjoyable read!"
2,Not realistic on many accounts,"I kept reading this book to see what, if anything, would happen. The final outcome was predictable but I felt certain events should not have taken place. I am very aware of these type of situations but the author took it a little too far. I would not recommend this book. I found it to be similar to a person writing in their diary and really of no interest to others."
5,Treat Yourself To A Beautiful Story,"I loved this book. It was funny, profound and authentic. Rhona is a great character. Her challenges are hysterical and touching. The resolution is uplifting and spirit filled. I only hope Lisa Lieberman Doctor continues to share Rhona's journey with us in other books and on film."
4,ex serviceman who could relate to this book,enjoyed reading the book because of it's no nonsense approach to the business of servicing men in our armed forces. I have used these same services while in korea and am sure they still operate just as the book describes. A somber but true look at woman stuck in a deep hole and trying to dig themselves out.Sad but real details of the bargirls in philippines. Angeles city still a hot spot for tours as well as thailand in the patpong district. Check out PATPONG SISTERS for a detailed read of commercial sex workers in thailand. Enjoyed both books.
5,Must Read for Amerasians,Great book depicting the realities of the US Military presence in East and SE Asia. I used this book as a primary source in my senior thesis about exploitation of women by multinational corporations (MNCs). The US Military filled the role of an MNC very well.
3,"I Love it, you might not","I love this album, but I admit I'm more of a James Taylor fan than most. If you're used to the greatest hits, than this might not be for you. It's not the stuff you hear on the adult contemporary stations, instead, it's a little more personal, and a lot more emotional. Is it a bad album? Certainly not, is it typical James Taylor? Absolutely. I'm sure most artists would agree that quite often, the ""Greatest Hits"" aren't always the best an artist has to offer, or even indicative for that matter. They're hand picked snippits thrown together for the masses. That phenomenon is apparent in this case. So I say to you, if you don't like this album, because it's not like the greatest hits; Perhaps you should try ""Greatest Hits Volume II"" It lives up to the former collections standards"
3,Lacks Taylor Charm-,"This album is a nice and soft Taylor Album. It has a few really nice songs, like You've got a friend, You can close you're eyes, long ago and faraway and riding on the railroad. Really though, it lacks a lot of charm that Sweet baby James had. The album is a long album with a long gap between hits; and a lot of those songs in between are songs you'd like to skip. If you're already a Taylor fan, there is no reason why you should not own this already because Taylor fans would kill for this stuff. But if you're someone who simply qualifies his music or is starting to get into it, this album is just a touch dull. Personally though it is not one of my favorite Taylor albums as a Taylormaniac myself. I would get the best of collection to get the essentials from this because the albums goes between great and awful."
2,mudslide slim and the blue horizon,I purchased this CD for a friend that does not have or know how to use a computer. After receiving this CD I did listen to it and did not care for it but it does not matter if I liked it or not since it was for somone else.
3,Middling Audiophile CD,"In contrast to the gold disc of Sweet Baby James, this release sounds kind of average -- I'm sure the balances are all there and the textures, but it's just not as impressive a listening experience as the audiophile CD of the earlier album. I don't mind owning it -- it's a fine album, and a very special one -- but it's no revelation, just a nice solid job on a nice solid album, but not that much better than what we've known in the listening for 40 years."
5,One of Chet's best,"The tracks from this record were recorded while Chet was in Italy in the earlier 60's. Although these tracks have been rereleased in other versions (""Chet is Back"", ""The Italian Sessions"") which includes more material from the session, this record has a different sound to it. The newer versions take away the reverb which gives this CD such a ""live"" and immediate sound, which gives the sound a lot of space and depth. The songs themselves are beautiful, and the rhthym section playing with him here is top notch, although unknown. Really sensitive playing, with the best version of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" you'll probably ever hear. Chet and the band really pull out on the stops for ""Blues in the Closet"" as a great closer. Casual fans of Chet might want to pick up one of the more recent (and available) versions of the record, but I prefer the sound here best."
4,Hoping For Some Standards,"Yoko Miwa is a very talented jazz pianist and the other members of her trio are also very talented. The recording is exceptionally well done and the compositions, all by Ms. Miwa, are lovely. The only criticism I have is that I was hoping to hear some traditional jazz standards and there were none. Even just a couple standard tunes if played as well as all the tunes on this CD would have caused me to give the rating five stars. Hopefully in the future she will produce a CD with some standards. Ms. Miwa's music is lovely to listen to and her talent is comparable to other Japanese jazz musicians such as Toshiko Akiyoshi (the grand dame of Japanese jazz pianists), Ayako Shirasaki, Eri Yamamoto and Junko Onishi. Please, Ms. Miwa, let's play some of those great jazz tunes that made jazz what it is."
2,Unbelievably Complicated,There are other recording programs that do a fantastic job that cost about the same and not nearly this complicated.
3,A souvenir,"It is a good souvenir about what happened on December 7th, 1941. If you are interested by something that looks more real than an Hoolywood movie, look at this DVD"
2,Too Much Information,"I purchased this book and the Boston Frommer's 2009. In summary, they each had too much information, presented in cluttered manner. After gleaning through these books for weeks, I still had not come up with a suitable itinerary for our trip. One day before leaving for Boston, I visited a neighbor who recently returned from Boston and borrowed her copy ofBoston For Dummies (Dummies Travel). Well, this was the book for this dummy!!!! We carried it the entire trip and left the other two at home. It was presented in the most simple and conscise manner and had very easy to follow and practical sample itineraries. Skip the other two, get the ""dummies"" book."
5,Awesome guide,"Everything you need to get around Boston. The maps, details, pull out maps are great resources when traveling. DK's are more expensive but well worth the extra cost."
3,feel like i didn't learn much from this book...,"other than a few places, i feel like i haven't gotten much from this book. it felt pretty vague. maybe i'll turn to fodors on boston in the near future."
4,"Great for pictures, but light on other details","Used this book for a 2 day trip. I like the pictures and images and history, but it's a bit light on other things. It didn't do as good of a job helping to prioritize. I'd buy them again, but only as a supplement to other bigger guides, not as my primary."
4,Good book for a Bible Study,Just got this and it appears it is a good book. We are start it in our small Bible study group.
2,Doesn't Exist - this was a homemade bootleg,"I think I know what happened. You'll notice Amazon has it listed under ""Everything Else"" and not ""Music"". That's becuase it was probably only ever available (like collectibles) from one of their affiliate vendors, not Amazon themselves.What most likely happened is someone tracked down all the individual tracks listed in the end credits, made their own compilation CD, printed up a cover, and sold it as the soundtrack (illegally, I might add!). This often happens with unavailable soundtracks.Further giveaways it wasn't an official release: The font of the title is wrong compared to the official theatrical posters and DVD art, and the listing says it's from MCA Records. MCA owns Universal Pictures - Ferris was put out by Paramount; they wouldn't release through MCA."
5,Armen's music and performance should not be missed,"Earlier this month, I was fortunate to hear Armen Donelian, jazz pianist and educator, in solo performance at Jim Luce's Fazioli Salon Concerts at LightSoundSpace in Rahway, NJ. In this intimate recital setting, Mr. Donelian performed an extended set of his own compositions, as well as a few of his own arrangements of Armenian songs from the 1800's. Hearing such delightful music performed on that beautiful Fazioli grand piano, well, it was a very special evening I'll not soon forget. Whether experienced as solo recordings, duets or quartet outings, Armen Donelian's music simply should not be missed. His command of his instrument and personal knowledge of the jazz idiom from which he speaks, should appeal to anyone interested in beautifully written and masterfully performed jazz piano. Bravo."
1,Don't be fooled,"There's not a lot of wisdom in these pages. I have a close friend in Mother Clare's church, the Order of Christ/Sophia. I have seen a lot of disturbing changes in her behavior since her involvement with that group. I have also seen a lot of practices in that church that don't seem very supportive of families, and don't even strike me as very Christian. I was hoping that reading this book would give me some comfort and reassurance about Clare's beliefs and her church's practices. After reading this book, and hearing Clare speak, I am more disheartened. Spiritual wholeness is more than just internal feelings and visions. You have to live your life in giving and loving ways. I agree with the reviewer below ... most of the positive reviews here seem to be written by members of Clare's church. If you're looking for inspiration from someone else's spiriual journey, or looking for a community where you can develop your relationship with God, I suggest looking elsewhere."
4,The Ultimate Bieber,"This DVD shows the rise and rise of the young pop superstar. Follow the story, as I did, on this informative and enlightening DVD. It's unbelievably good."
4,Inspirational!,DVD caputes the world wide sensation that is Justin Beiber. My Daughter begged me for weeks to get her this DVD. I finally bought it for her birthday and she has been enthralled ever since. Great DVD for Justin Beiber fans!
4,Great DVD,"My niece is a huge fan of Justin Bieber, must like a lot of girls her age. So I got her this DVD on a whim after seeing it in stores. She was so happy when she saw it and watched it right away. She loved the insight into his life and in all honestly gave me more respect for him, myself."
2,Not the best video on Justin...,"After viewing all the DVDs available on Justin Bieber, I have to say this is the worst one. It was boring. Ten year old got up and left the room, she said she liked Never Say Never better. So did I. This one was ALL talk, no singing and we didn't care for some of the people reviewing his rise to fame. Even the title was misleading to me. Also didn't care for the constant reference and filming of the girl that beat him out in his home town talent contest. She's certainly no Justin Bieber. Got the feeling the people in the DVD just didn't care much for him. I'm no teenager, but I like him and think he has a good chance of being around a while. If he can keep his head and not go ""Hollywood"" on us. This DVD was a waste of money."
5,Highly recommend!,The story of Justin Bieber's rise to worldwide fame is almost unbelievable! This video contains great footage and is super entertaining. I would definitely recommend it to any Bieber fan!
3,For Better or for Worse?,"This is a very interesting CD of Callas and Di Stefano. Callas' voice always bothered me: not beautiful, bottled and with strange vowels. ""Oui"" became Euh. Why? This seems like it should have been easily fixed as it was not just in the upper registers that it occurred. After all that time, however, she corrected the problem! I actually find her singing more enjoyable than what she recorded a decade earlier, namely the Norma and Tosca recordings. The Werther and Carmen excerpts are magnificent as there are few high notes. The duet in the Vespers is rather clumsy and ill-focused by both artists. Di Stefano is able to produce very soft notes at the top of his range (such as the end of the flower song) but you get the idea that he does it out of necessity rather than for artistic reasons. My favorite moment, though, is in the Suicidio aria when Callas has the worst wobble ever on a high note. It's quite amusing, though the aria itself is quite thrilling."
5,EXCELLANT HUNTING GAME,"If you have been looking for a good hunting game than buy a cabela's hunting game. The AI of the animals is amazing it's almost like your'e really hunting. The Deer Hunt 2005 season is the same way. You have a choice of what rifle you want to use and you can buy items from binoculars to deer feeders. You can hunt in places from montana new mexico to canada. I suggest any hunting fan to buy this game, it's awesome!"
4,Good,This Cd was pretty good! I think the best song was either the Mokona song or the First song! Visit my *new* site at:: http://princessemeraude.homepage.com
5,Magic Knight Rayearth/Rayearth2 Cd,I did not get the cd yet but ive herd most of the songs.Amazon is delaying shipping on me.please ship my cd.If you want to know the translation of the unyielding wish i can translate it i have dubbed magic knight rayearth videos so i know the tv versions and the whole unyielding wish and i can translate half of the courage leading to tomorrow also i hold the light and darkness the 3rd opening and the 3rd ending. i have a dubbed video with them on it too in english.
4,Rayearth Vocal Bests,"For those who love the series Magic Knight Rayearth and liked the music, this CD is probably something you should get. :) It contains the various opening and ending themes for the first series Rayearth, as well as several assorted vocals including Hikaru, Umi and Fuu's song trying to define just what, exactly, Mokona actually IS.Also includes my personal favorite Rayearth vocal, Itsuka Tenshi ni Nareru. :)"
5,Alleluyah,If you have been struggling to lose weight ! this is the book for you. Item was shipped within few days. Great product at a very cheap price.
3,Not a diet for people with a problem other than overweight,"This diet is certainly an improvement over the average American diet, but the title is a bit misleading. I ordered it because I was diagnosed as being insulin resistant (Type II diabetes or almost there). As it turns out, this book is for weight loss only and will not work to alleviate symptoms for someone who has a medical problem. The plan is way too liberal with carbs for someone who is truly senstitive to carbs or who is so insulin resistant that they have developed noticeable symptoms other than weight gain. It bashes fat and tries to combine its principles with those of the American Heart Association's low fat diet. The Schwarzbein Principle by Diana Schwarzbein and Nancy Deville is a much better choice for anyone who needs to do more than lose weight."
3,Okay I guess,"Nothing new as far as information about diet, exercise, medication and diabetes goes. All four areas need to be covered and this book was pretty limited to foods and a wee bit about the rest."
5,Very eye-opening!,"I have been doing things wrong all along and it will explain why I can never seem to lose weight. I have PCOS and insulin resistance, which go hand-in-hand.. I have been on the diet for a week and already lost 5 lbs. feel good and not hungry.. This book was VERY eye-opening to me.. I plan to try to follow this method of eating for the rest of my life and possible prevent diabetes. Thanks!"
4,For women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome - worth looking @,"For women with PCOS, this book offers a ""palatable"" alternative to the more popular low-carb diet books like Atkins.Visit any PCOS community site ie SoulCysters.com, PCOSupport.org, or the PCOS Usenet groups, and you'll find it's quite the 'buzz' and for good reason: It attempts to address the 'core' of the disorder: Insulin Resistance.Online, women with PCOS have reported great success with losing weight on this plan.Note: this book isn't just for women with PCOS, as Insulin Resistance can strike all.I would also suggest that readers check out ""Managing Insulin Resistance."" It's a fine companion for this book."
5,This WORKS!,"My recent diagnosis of insulin resistance prompted me to purchase this book. This book explains what insulin resistance is and what you can do about it. It's not really a ""diet"" that you have to follow.....it's rules to keep in mind whenever you eat. You learn the right way to eat to keep your blood sugar more stable instead of spiking and plummeting. I was stuck at the same weight (in spite of frequent exercise) for 9 months after the birth of my 2nd son until I started following the guidelines in this book. I've lost 5 lbs in the first week of keeping the rules in mind. Hopefully this is the beginning of a trend!"
3,Insulin Resistance Diet,"The book is ""OK"" but I needed a week or so of actual menus. The book has lots of information about Insulin Resistance but I need more help with day to day eating."
2,Very Strict,"Although this book contains many great ideas, I was disappointed that it was so rigid and strict and I found the concepts difficult to implement. I did take away a few general principles that I will apply to my eating, but overall I don't see myself being able to follow this plan. Also a large part of this book is recipes and lists of foods. I'm sure someone who has serious blood sugar issues and the ability to follow a strict plan would benefit greatly from this book."
1,Did not like this book at all!,"I found nothing new about IR in this book that I didn't already know. I found the info jumbled, and it contradicted its statements more than once. It was confusing advice with no real plan laid out as to eat what with what. Money down the drain as far as I'm concerned!"
5,Great book,Still reading and working the program. It was so easy to download to my kindle and begin reading right when I wanted to.
4,simple and makes sense,I really like this book. It makes sense and is easy to apply to real life. My only complaint is that in the kindle edition you dont get the 10ish pages of food samples and portions that are in the book. That was the main reason i bought the version to have on my phone.
4,The Insulin Resistant Diet,"Very thought provocative. I am trying the link and balance method. It just makes sense. If you think you may be sensitive, there is a self test which is of great help."
5,"Excellent book, excellent buy","If you suspect of having Insulin-Resistance, then you should get this book. It explains everything very clearly and then introduces you to the diet plan, which isn't hard at all to follow. I was very motivated with this book and finished really fast. Deffinitely recommended."
4,lots of info,Finally some information on the subject that I could understand.this book make sense and was very help full. I like how theyre-arranged the food pyramid for people with insulin resistance.
4,Great Info...Dud Recipes,"This book contains great information regarding insulin resistant metabolic issues, and food selections built around the glycemic index. For that reason alone, I'm OK with the price tag. I'm glad I bought it. Now having said that....thankfully, I didn't buy it for the recipes. The recipes include such things as ""instant mashed potatoes"", ""packets of artificial sweeteners"", ""packaged taco seasoning"", etc. If you're OK with packaged ingredients, you may like the recipes in this book, but if you're interested in cooking with fresh and healthy ingredients, you'll find the recipes in this book to be a complete waste of time."
4,Easy,This book is easy to follow. I feel that even in a bind where healthy food is scarce I can still link and balance not feel like I need a nap after eating. It's about how you eat. I make really good food choices but for people who have trouble I would say just link and balance your food for a while and then start adding in the healthy choices. This book just makes sense.
4,Pretty Good Book,"This is a good book. Easy to read and understand. The hard part is changing your eating habits. The book offers no miracles, just straight forward advice and a great method to use when deciding what foods to eat. The good thing is does not deprive you of things that people with PCOS like, like potatoes and bread- we can have those things as long as we balance with protein. The book shows you how. If you have PCOS, this is a great book."
5,HYPOGLYCEMICS >>>BUY THIS BOOK NOW!,"This is THE greatest book. I was diagnosed with hypoglycemia in my early 20's and the only advise given to me was and to make sure that I ate on a regular schedule to control it. Needless to say, my condition worsened and now 25 years later I am severly hypoglycemic and suffering from headaches, aches and pains, depression and exhaustion that is beyond description. ONE WEEK after following the ""diet"" in this book and I feel like my old self again. The ""diet"" is tremendously easy to follow and allows an individual any food (some in moderation). This book is so good, order it today and pay the extra for rush shipping!"
5,Absolutely Wonderful!!,"Once you read through this book and put it into practice, if you are carb sensitive, you will lose weight. I've tried watching what I eat to where I was eating 1500 calories a day but I could not lose weight. I bought this book and in 4 months I lost 30 pounds. It's very important to balance you cars and protein and eat no more than 30 grams of carbs every 2 or 3 hours. If you follow that advice it will come off. I am 39 years old and of all the diets I have been on this is the only one that works for me."
1,Not a Good Diet,"This is one of the worst diet books I've ever tried. Terrible recipes full of fake, tasteless, plastic fat-free foods. The food on this plan gave me horrible cravings because I wasn't eating enough fat. Also, the authors don't address sugar cravings and hypoglycemia. So I made the chocolate cake and ate half of it at once and then made myself throw the rest out so I would stop eating it. I stopped using this plan after a day or two, it was obvious it wouldn't satisfy me and my energy wasn't great either."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a good theory but in real use, doesn't work. I read the book twice and went out and bought all the protein items and the lower carb items; I wrote everything down. Ate 6 times a day (small meals/snacks) and after 3 weeks I'm down a big 4 lbs. I'm going back to WW where I can lose 6 or 7 lbs the first week. All this is is another scam diet book...Weight Watchers is the best."
1,STUFF AND NONSENSE!,"I was amazed and the nonsense in this book! The idea you could lose weight by eating protein with everything, and I mean anything, just does not fit. There does not seem to be good nutritional advice. The links and balances was cute, but seemed a bit too complicated for everyday use. This book would be good for those who do not really want to lose weight, but like to read about it."
3,The Insulin Resistance Diet,"This book has some valuable information, but as one gets into it, the authors fall into the same pattern as most medical personnel. As far as diet is concerned, the ""link-and-balance"" method is probably beneficial, butthey have things included in the diet that NO ONE with insulin resistance should eat (and no one withoutinsulin resistance). To include food items with refined carbohydrates in the diet is ludicrous. It's amazing how little most doctors actually know about a proper diet for people with insulin resistance."
2,IR Diet,It does not really help with my diabetics. It is not a great deal of difference from other diets just a slight variation.
4,This is for the 1st edition but...,"i'm sure this book is even BETTER! The book I read, several yrs ago now, showed how to balance a meal with protein and carbs, and fat too. It was very specific & really helped with my cravings. Don't eat a carb without protein or if u must, a healthy fat. Hopefully, u'll eat both protein and fat with ur carb tho. I had read several books about dieting for carb cravings/insulin resistance and this book by Dr. Hart was THE best. I have a medical condition, PCOS, that has recently been studied more in the medical community and there are more books written about that -- with their diets also. This is still a good book especially for men or women who are just pre-diabetic, not PCOS-sufferers.I have rec'd this book to at least 20 ppl in the past 10 yrs."
5,Syndrome X: Managing Insulin Resistance,I love this book! I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and these receipes are what i needed since I am Insulin Resistant.
4,Easy Read,"I really enjoyed reading this book, with all the different diet/weight loss books out there this one is a bit more informative and gives you real world advice using real food that you don't have to buy at special markets to make. Implementing the strategies was easy and remembering how to make great food choices without having to write anything down was priceless to me. If you gain weight very easily as I do, and are sensitive to carbs but don't want to live without them, then this book is for you."
3,Okay for Paper MacHe,"I'm not really interested in Paper MacHe but I've been a dollmaker for quite some time and am very interested in learning more about Paperclay. There is another book that is supposedly the best for Paperclay - ""Sculpting Doll in Paperclay"" by Robert McKinley but it's sold out and difficult to find - so I opted for this one. I found this book to be fairly similar in techinique to many other dollmaking books in other media. There wasn't all that much that made it stand apart. I guess if you're very interested in Paper MacHe, then this is the book for you. If you're wanting to learn more about Paperclay techniques, skip this book and look for the one by McKinley instead."
5,a delightful and long awaited dollmaking book!,"This book is illustrated with many magnificent and easily followed directions. You can really make a doll that is more meaningful then all others because you have made it with your own hands. The authors step by step instructions are so simple to follow! Your finished product is your own masterpiece, thanks to Doris. Bravo, Doris."
2,It wasn't what I expected,I am a Lucy fan and I own most of her collection. I bought this video thinking it would be great but the dvd skiped at the begining of the show and the show really makes no sense its a bunch of clips all put together. I would not recomend it.
1,This is not Lucy's lost epsides,It was not the lost episodes of Lucy It was segments of Lucy on different TV shows Does not show an entire episode or partial ones Very disappointing
3,Lucy's other episodes,"I liked this DVD, although the picture quality could be miles better, I liked seeing all these guest appearences together on one DVD. I had seen clips of most of these appearences on specials, but the one for Westinghouse was a complete surprise. I liked hearing Lucy being called 'Mrs. Arnaz' for a change. I hope someday all these appearences will be restored as they should be."
5,came in in reasonable time,love this anime and trying to get the rest of the series so me and my hubby can watch over and over
4,The price was Right,This was a gift that was received in very short order and great full to be able to have the book for Book Club.thanks Heidi
2,Not Very Exciting,"This book is a review of a very successful real estate company in Canada. My more then exciting introduction is about how I felt about the book. There were facts, lots of them but overall no real excitement or much to get the normal reader interested in the book. I got through about 175 pages before I gave up. The author tried to punch up the book, but the subject matter did not lend its self to it, there is just noting scandalous or exciting about a well-run company. This is more of a 400-page case study best left to a university class on management. Unless you work here or are related to some on that does I doubt you would find much value in this book."
1,My grandchildren could play this game...,"As everyone else has already testified, this game is a joke... I finished one case while mindless thinking about my grocery list. I have three grandchildren ages 18 mos to 6 yrs. Any one of them could've played this game. While the concept was promising, the reality was very disappointing. Activision would do well to spend more time and money on developing this game if they ever hope to stand up against the likes of L & A and CSI (both series of games in which I am a huge fan!!) Try again, Activision!!"
1,"Good TV show. Stupid, stupid game.","Don't waste your time with this one. I thought with the Cold Case Files TV show as inspiration, this could be interesting and fun. Wrong! The whole game takes less than 2 hours and every step forward in the plot is obvious. Even when this game goes on sale for 9.99 (which should be very soon with this stinker), I wouldn't recommend it any price."
1,WORST GAME EVER,"This game is the biggest waste of money ever, Activision should pay you to play it. If you are looking for this type of game I highly recommend any of the CSI series games. The CSI series is excellent and each CSI case takes longer to solve than the entire Cold Case game."
3,Fun but a little short,"This was a really fun game, except for the length. There were 7 cases overall, but they only took about 20 minutes apiece. Buy this game used, don't pay full price."
1,I'd give zero stars if possible.,"If you are a fan of this show and watch regularly you have already seen the solutions to each of these cases. A major disappointment. Go buy a CSI, L&O, heck even a Nancy Drew adventure game, it will challenge you way more than this waste of time."
1,THE WORST GAME EVER!,This is the absolute WORST game I have ever played. It is nothing but a cheap infomercial to plug the TV show. The lab tech in the game does close to nothing and the so called computer research is so skimpy I have to laugh. Stay FAR FAR away from this bomb!!!
1,Cold Case Files Worst Game Ever Dont Bother,Ok I bought this game because i thought it was going to be similar to csi or law and order. This game doesnt even come close. I read the other reviews on here about how bad the game was. I wish i had listened. The game states there are 35 possible outcomes but i didnt see it. I finished the first case in 5 minutes and then i replayed it thinking there would be a different outcome because the game states 35 possibilities but the outcome was the same. I finished the whole game in less than an hour. there isnt really much playing to do and thinking involved at all. you barely collect evidence or work in the lab. this game was really a waste of time and money. All six cases dont add up to 1 case of CSI.
2,Good grief!,"What a terrific disappointment this game was. I mean, I wasn't expecting a whole heck of a lot, but it didn't even come up to *that* level. ""Cheapjack rip-off attempt to cash in on CSI's fame"" doesn't begin to cover it, but it's a start.If you like the show, watch it; then go play the two CSI games. I guarantee you a better time."
1,"So where's the ""fun""?","What kind of a cheap @$$ game is this?! It's not even a game, hardly! It's like a crappy TV show where you pick how slow it goes. There's no challenge at all. And there are so few leads and options in each case that it's impossible to NOT win each case. And it all amounts to a grand total of maybe 3 hours of gameplay, if you could even call it that in this case.I can't imagine why this game is even on the market. The only thing it's good for, perhaps, is a nice hearty laugh... because it's so bad. It's a total rip-off. I could create a better game, and I don't know anything about creating stuff like that. Get the CSI games instead. Those are awesome. The Law and Order games are great too. Just do not get this game.I'd give it zero stars if I could."
3,Too Short,"This game was entertaining, but it was way too short. I got through all of the cases in about three hours, faster if I wouldn't have been interrupted, but the cases were entertaining. I do recommend this game if you just want to fill up a a few hours, but not if you're looking for some intellectual stimulation."
1,Waste of Money,"The way the box reads you think that you are actually going to have to think your way through the game. Unfortunately, I finished all of the cases and the ""bonus"" case in about 2 hours last night. Bought the game, installed it, started playing and waa immediately let down by the simplicity. I expected a bit better than what I got. This game was simple enough that a 10 year old could get through it in a couple of hours. Major disappointment for $20."
4,Pretty for a little girl,"The necklace did not seem to be of quite the same quality as some similar earrings I purchased from a different seller at the same time. However, it is of average value for the price, and makes a pretty necklace for a little girl who loves ponies. The delivery was very prompt and the company appears to offer very good customer service."
3,"A great compilation, except...","If you are interested in Pink Floyd, you should buy the albums, starting with Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, The Wall, and Meddle, then continue on from there. This has a 17 minute version of ""Echoes"". The actual song (which can be found on the ""Meddle"" album) is 23 minutes long. Also, it only contains the first 7 parts of ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"". This compilation also contains several ""jumps"" and ""edits"", so that the songs synch with one another, due to the fact that most of the songs are from concept albums. Casual fans may want to pick this up, but die hard Floyd fans will want to stick with the albums."
1,What's the Point,"As with majority of the songs on this album they should be heard in the context of the album for which they were created...Buy Dark Side, The Wall...etc. Don't waste your time on a record of singles from a band that didn't intend them as such (at least as Roger Waters intended...not David Gilmour)"
1,Weak compilation from a great band,"The 1 star is for this compilation.Most of the songs are great, I mean the post-Syd era songs. I don't like their early songs, listen to PF from Meddle.The main reason I gave this album only 1 star is that there is a much better compilation out there: Roger Water's In The Flesh.Far better than this one, believe me. Get THAT one and save your money."

2,to mouch new stuff,"This is not a great ""greatest hits"".There are to many songs from the new Pink Floyd.The new Pink Floyd are not the real Pink Floyd.Only one song from ""the final cut""????? WhyOnly one song from ""animals"" Whyyyyyy!!!Dont buy this cd."
2,Big disappointment,"I'll cut to the chase- what's wrong? Big hits not included! No 'Dirty woman'. Should have been a (reasonably priced) 3-CD collection, not jammed on 2 discs. Which brings me to my second complaint - They bled the songs together, so one starts before the other is finished. Case in point - No famous exhale at the end of The Wall - substituted by the first note of the next song. Last time I encountered this bleeding was Don Henley's CD Building the Perfect Beast."
4,Yes it's missing some but this is still worth it,Ok first your getting everything worth getting from darkside here sure barin damage is great but the cd doesn't miss it in my opinion my only problem is the wall probally there best album is not done jusdice where's good by blue sky run like hell thin ice ect so I say get this get the wall and because darkside is such a huge album get that and you'll be all setPS not that most of you don't know this but every single song kicks a** it is the best greatest hits ever made cause it works as a album after this probally 40 licks man Rock N Roll
5,Great Best of Album,"This is a good best of Album with some of Pink Floyds greates and best known songs if your new to floyd and whant to hear good songs from there whole carer this is a great place to start at.Of course there a re good songs mising there alweys is on Those Best of CD's but that dont mather.The only big mising song that whuld have been fun to have I think is a edited version of Atom heart mother like the edited Echoes, that whuld have been fun, becaus they shuld have at least one song from all the albums. ather then that a great buy."
4,It could've been perfect... when dogs fly!,"I would've put ""Dogs"" not ""Sheep"" on here.Bike, One of these days, Set the controls... all could've been omitted.I've yet to come across a ""real"" greatest hits package, seems like there's always something missing. I wonder if that's intentional? Probably."
3,"good, but could be better","This cd leaves me looking for more. It it contains a great deal of great Floyd songs, but some could be left off, and some could be added.This contains most of the essential songs from their carreer, but it's missing some things. For instance, they left off such awsome songs as ""Brain Damage"", ""Eclipse"", ""Welcome to The Machine"", ""Have a Cigar"", ""Young Lust"", ""Run Like Hell"", ""Not Now John"", and ""On the Turning Away"". What makes this worse is that they put instead ""Marrooned"", ""Keep Talking"", and ""The Fletcher Memorial Home"".If you are looking for a true ""best of Pink Floyd"", you will have to buy the $200+ Shine On box set, because you can't capture the genius of this band on two CDs. If you are looking for an introduction to a highly influential and expirimental band, you've found it here."
4,Not bad as greatest hits albums go...,"I'll admit, I mainly bought this because I have just about all the studio releases of Pink Floyd, David Gilmour, Syd Barret, Roger Waters, Nick Mason and Richard Wright plus I have a few bootlegs. This would probably be a good introduction to Pink Floyd but I wouldn't recommend it for much else. Many of the Pink Floyd songs shouldn't be taken off the albums but they don't do a bad job with their selections. I'll admit its pretty cool to have a studio version of When The Tigers Broke Free though.If you don't have any Pink Floyd this album would be a good introduction. I'm impressed that they cover more than just the ""Radio Floyd"" songs. If you already have all the albums, you might want to think twice before buying this one."
2,This album is very un-pink floyded..,"I am life-long Pink Floyd but I have to say that Echoes is not a proper Pink Floyd greatest hits. It may have some of the biggest known singles such as Us and Them, Money, Wish You Were Here, etc.. But How the hell on earth do the songs such as Young Lust, Run Like Hell, Brain Damage/Eclipse are missing.. That's baffle me. Also, The songs from Syd era are under represent. But the sequential of the songs is really killing me.. They don't flow smoothly from song to song. Hence, the concept of ""Concept Album"" is entirely missing.. And that's not Pink Floyd. If I were you guys. I'd rather go out and buy all those original Pink Floyd Albums.."
5,Great compilation,"If you like pink floyd, I would reccomend that you get this best hits album. This 2 disc album features songs from all points of their career, spanning from syd barret's time to david gilmours. Of course, as with all best hits albums, perhaps there should have been other songs put on such as ""good bye blue sky"" and ""careful with that axe eugene"". Overall, I can't really find much fault with this album, it does pretty much focus on the best songs of their career."
5,Best Of takes a new meaning,"One of the real definitive ""Best Of"" collections of this colossal bands history. This is not only a great collection of tracks but its also arranged and mixed to move you along a journey as you listen. If you consider yourself a Pink Floyd fan, you can not do without this 2 CD treasure. If you've not had the pleasure of hearing Pink Floyd, here's your best chance. Hats off the remastering team on this one."
5,get this asap its a must for Floyd Fans,"I see alot of people complaining about a best of. You get all the greatest Floyd songs on two discs what more can you ask.I have been a Floyd fan since i was fourteen, so ive been listening to them for about four and a half years now and they rock. If you like lugging 5 albums around with you in your car or small ass truck like me then get this 2 disc set and you'll be happy. You won't have to pop out one disc to put in a better one. I like best of albums cause if you have the originals you don't have to worry about scratching them when storing them away. All of you complaining you obviously don't know a good deal when you see one so good luck buying cds idiots."
2,Pink floyd is not meant to be listened to like this,"Pink floyd songs are great, yes. But, Pink Floyd albums are supposed to be listened to one album at a time for the full effect to take place. Combining various tracks into 1 cd would be like taking a bunch of artists paintings and cutting out parts of each one and randomly placing them as 1 painting, it doesnt give the proper effect."
2,"Good band, Do NOT buy this crappy compilation.","I really like Pink Floydm but DO NOT BUY THIS CD. They trim down and butcher songs like MAROONED and ECHOES, and what's the point of Calling it ""Echoes"" if they cut out 7 minutes of the greatest song of all time? DO NOT BUY"
4,"Not Bad, but I Wouldn't Mind a 3rd CD","Sure, it has the majority of Floyd's works.A few problems are present though:1. Marooned is shorter than the version from The Division Bell2. Echoes is also around 16 minutes, not the awesome 24 (I realize this is beacuse the disc can only hold 80 mins. of music)3. Why is Us and Them not right after Money?4. Where's Young Lust, Run Like Hell, Dogs, Have a Cigar, and Lucifer Sam?The good stuff:1. It flows very nicely for a greatest hits album2. You still get your money's worth of musicSummary:Good music, but the original albums are where the power is from. There are a lot more songs that can added. All-in-all, one of the best greatest hits albums out there."
1,....and now a word from our sponser......,"Do not be fooled by this collection of unbalanced and unfocused hits(?), best of (?) Anthology (?). This has the focus of those old TV record collections. I don't know what this mess is. I recomend that you log on to Madster and get it for what it is worth. Sad release from an otherwise exquisit outfit."
2,Fleecing the Public!,"How can you take amazing musical moments like ""The Great Gig in the Sky,"" which follows ""Time"" on ""Dark Side"" and just slap it on a CD. Pink Floyd, more than most groups, have songs that MUST be listened to in the context of their original albums. Why anyone would shell out the cash for this jumble instead of buying ""The Wall"" and their other masterpieces is beyond me?! Since it was a success, you know that P.T. Barnum was right!!!!"
3,Could've Been Better,"There are some choice songs on this CD. However, They really don't blend well. Marooned, what was the point of putting that on there? In its place could have been Have A Cigar or Pigs both great songs. Pigs really should have made it because of the blistering guitar solo by Gilmour. What really annoys me is the way they mixed Comfortably Numb. Time to go...Is there anybody out there... On The Wall it sounds good but on this it just doesn't belong. I give this 3 stars. This album was saved from total blah by a nice second CD. As far as a sleeve...who wants song lyrics...I would of rather have had an explanation as to why some of those songs are on there...though some are obvious and Floyd fans know which ones they are. But for the ones that have me baffled I would really like to know."
5,"BEST ""BEST OF . . ."" COLLECTION TO DATE","I was a little concerned about the order of the track listing at first, and how the songs would flow from one to another, but someone obviously put a lot of thought into it because it moves very well. The track listing is a very good representation of Pink's history. There are a few omissions that I'd have liked to seen included, like PIGS from the ANIMALS album, MOTHER from THE WALL, and NOT NOW JOHN from THE FINAL CUT. Everyone has their favorites and this set is sure to miss a couple no matter what. I am disappointed that they didn't include CAREFUL WITH THAT AXE EUGENE, but that's my only real complaint. The remaster sound quality is excellent and will blow the speakers out of the best sound systems. All in all, a very good set. Kudos to Capitol Records!"
3,Perhaps for fans of the band,"Have enjoyed listening the tracks with which I was familiar before purchasing this album, however did not find much that appealed to me among the remainder."
5,FLOYD RULES,This is a must own for any Pink Floyd lover! I listen to it all the time and the price was just right
3,missing too much,"This cd has some great songs but its not what makes pink floyd so great. I own The Wall, Dark Side, Animals, and Wish You Were Here. There is so much missing. I would give this album 4 stars for the great music but its missing the greatest pink floyd song of time, and my personal favorite song.....DOGS"
1,warning,if you buy this cd there is a 50% chance that it is a copy-proof cd that is not guaranteed to play on all cd players.
3,One for the uninitiated...maybe,"Perhaps those new to ""Pink Floyd"", will listen to this and then buy the individual albums that these tracks were culled from. However, it's not a truly inspirational package, apart from the cover art. This band is simply too big for a 2-disc set, and much of this release is marred by the inevitable disjointedness and lack of continuity when individual tracks are removed from the albums. Furthermore, ""Echoes"" and ""Marooned"" are edited, and that irritates me. For those who grew up with much of this music, and have or had the albums, this issue is an annoying waste of time, and will be one for completists."
5,Pink Floyd,My husband wanted a Pink Floyd CD for Christmas. This is the best. He said it is exactly what he wanted.Great cd
3,"Not THE best greatest hits, but c'mon it's Pink Floyd!","'Best of's...' really are just marketing excerises, and in truth there are just some bands that can't exactly have a 'best of'. So why Pink Floyd? Only because they're one of the greatest bands of all-time! But even in this sweet 2CD package, this compilation hits can only go so far. It might be pleasing to some, and to be honest I love most of it.But just like I said, there are some who just can't have something like a 'greatest hits', because there are too many 'hits' to mention all at once!If you're a big fan like myself, then just get 'Dark Side Of The Moon' or 'The Wall' instead.Somewhat excellent (because it's Floyd), but flawed."
2,ehhhh,"I don't think the selection is very good...For starters, where is ""Green is the Colour,"" where is ""Summer of '68,"" where is ""Wot's Uh the Deal??"" My three favorite Floyd songs, missing.The stuff between Syd Barrett and Dark Side is poorly represented... But how can you sum up one of greatest bands ever to exist in just two CDs? Use this CD as a starter to get into Pink Floyd, but check out the albums they are all classics."
1,Why Buy?,What's the point of buying this album when you can listen to all of these songs for free at pinkfloyd.com?
4,Great CD,"This is an absolutely phenomenal cd and a must have. I am 15 and i've been listening to pink floyd for probably 3 or 4 years so the thing that I do notice about this album is that it doesn't flow as well as the others. The great thing about floyd is that albums such as The Wall and Dark Side of the Moon flow so well and each song leads to the next so well that it makes for a masterpiece. Echoes is a collection of the greatest hits, so it somewhat takes away from each song. Still a great cd though. Could have included songs such as Brain Damage/Eclipse, maybe another song from Wish You Were Here such as Welcome to the Machine or Have a Cigar. Those are just some of my personal favorites. I recommend purchasing this cd."
1,Save your money,"What is the point of this album? Casual Christmas shoppers get a stack of obscure filler mixed with hits. Fans get nothing new. Oh, the songs segue into each other. Wow. And a creative track sequence too. Woo hoo. Pink Floyd rip off their fans again. Give a decent one disc greatest hits set, or give us a CD of unreleased stuff."
2,Echoes: the best of pink floyd,"I agree with other reviewers, this two disk set is missing so many songs that I consider hits. In fact, only half the songs included in this set could be considered hits. I can't ever remember hitting the forward button on my cd player so often, to skip songs. Who decided all these songs were hits? Will a second anthology come out next Christmas with the rest of the hits? Only a true die-hard fan will enjoy all the songs on these two disks and they probably already have the original albums. Even though you won't hear the song on this set, I suggest that like Mr. Floyd, you hang up on this collection."
3,"Lack of flow, skip this collection","I bought this CD as a sort of preview of Pink Floyd. At first I found this collection to be a satisfying mix of tunes. Then, I got a chance to hear part of the original DARK SIDE OF THE MOOON and THE WALL. What a difference! I found a beautifuly woven, intricate message that was composed of songs that were not only meant to be listened to as individuals but also flow into each other in a larger story.This collection does include the best songs, but takes away some of their value due to the fact that they were taken out of context. Pink Floyd set up many of their albums as complete works. If any of these songs were taken out of order, they make much less sense. I feel that the beautiful, intricate, and stunning musical message is nearly completely destroyed. I recommend that first-time listeners dive in and go for THE WALL or DARK SIDE OF THE MOON instead of this."
4,Great Compilation,"This two disc set is a great compilation album, with a few exceptions. These exceptions are the cutting-short of the songs ""Echoes"" and ""Shine on you Crazy Diamond"". I don't really like all of the songs they picked, such as the song ""Bike"" because that is not the Pink Floyd sound that I know. It just sounds too oldies. Other than that, the album is great and if you are a Pink Floyd you should definitely make this a part of your CD collection. You won't regret it."
4,Great Best of Set,"In order to fit Mother and Run Like Hell, I would have replaced Echoes from Meddle with Echoes Part 1 from Live in Pompeii. The track is certainly a classic, but a little too long for a Best Of compilation, in my opinion. Besides, the Pompeii version is brilliant."
3,Echoes - the best of pink floyd,This product has not been used yet. It is a present for Father's Day. Sorry I couldn't have been more helpful.
1,Old...,"Ew, Pink Floyd is so old and creepy. I honestly can't listen to anything made before 1981 because the sounds simply offend me. What kind of sick, weird, old people find this music entertaining? I guess you would have to be stoned to enjoy it."
1,"BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD RECORD, YES IT IS BAD",THIS IS BAD. PERIOD. BAD BAD BAD.REALLY REALLY BAD. OR WORSE. BUT IT IS BAD.This music you are so hooked to call it is BAD. Period. Bad.BAD BAD BAD. Period. BAD. PERIOD. BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD.Unbearable to listen to. Yuk hippie slime. It will ruin your hunger and sleep. (...)
3,More Than a Little Disappointed,"I am more than a little disappointed with the Best of Pink Floyd CD set. First of all, most of the songs by Syd Barrett should not have been included. I don't own A Saucerful of Secrets and The Pipers at the Gates of Dawn... and now I know why. The songs just take up space on this CD. Second, why not include songs like ""Welcome to the Machine"", ""Brain Damage/Eclipse"", ""Mother"", ""Run Like Hell"", The Gunner's Dream"", ""On the Turning Away"" and ""Take It Back""? These songs are all better than at least half the songs presently on the CD. Were any Pink Floyd fans consulted in compliling the song list?"
2,What?,"Oh, it's just another collection of songs that were not on other, previous collections.Now Dogs and Pigs stood in the basket and they grabbed out Sheep.On the Turning Away has gone but High Hopes and Learning 2 Fly arrived!Brain Damage and Eclipse had no place here so Us and Them and A Great Gig In The Sky were put on instead.No, this is ain't a best of, this is a collection of songs from a great band.I gave 2 stars because it is Pink Floyd."
2,To mouch new songs,"To much new songs from Gilmore.Why: Brain damage,eclipse,dogs,pigs,mother,two suns in the sunset,............."
4,almost perfect,"Pink Floyd is without a doubt one of the best rock groups of all time. and this album is a testament to that, i give it only four stars because it doesn't have Welcome to the Machine, one of my alltime favs. but overall this is a fantastic album and something every music lover should have"
2,sorry..that's not pink floyd,"First let me say - Pink floyd is the best band ever existed. They made music at it's perfect shape.BUT - Pink Floyd is not a band that should put out a greatest hits CD. Every CD that was made by Pink Floyd has it's own personality. every song matches the record and is an integal part of it. To take some of their more popular songs and put it on a collection disc - is WRONG. I think it's just another try to get some money out of us and it doesn't worth it! if you wanna hear pink floyd - buy their original CDs, you won't regret it!!"
3,Tough to give Pink Floyd 3 stars but,"This package could have been a lot better if the egos could come together and replace some of the material that shouldn't be on this release with some earlier material that SHOULD be on the cd. I said in other Pink Floyd/Roger Waters reviews that you should listen to each Pink Floyd/Roger Waters cd from beginning to end to feel the concept. There is no way you can do it listening to a greatest hits cd, especially one that follows absolutely no concept format. Sure there are some fine songs on here but could have been done much better."
2,dissapointoing,"When I got this CD, I expected the best of albums such as Dark side of the Moon, Wish you were here, the wall, etc... Instead I got a FEW song I liked and knew, and the rest was old ... album filler. I am still a huge pink floyd fan, but this so called best his album is the worst best hits album ever."
5,The edge and back?,"It's difficult to sum up a vast career of excellence such as that of Pink Floyd in a three hour, two-disc compilation, but this compilation does as good of a job as one would hope for. From ""Arnold Layne"" to ""Comfortably Numb"" to ""Keep Talking,"" Echoes gives an excellent overview. It's almost a concept album in itself considering it has been mixed so that the songs blend with each other between tracks (a'la Dark Side of the Moon) so that it's almost a continuious symphony of sound. In conclusion, this album makes an excellent effort at introducing the many facets of the Floyd to the public."
4,where's Have a Cigar,"There could have been a few more inclusions -- Have a Cigar, Brain Damage, The Final Cut but the songs here are a nice overview of the history of the band from Syd Barrett up to the latest lineup. Overall its a good listen...I still may have to keep Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall."
4,Floyd fans should be satisfied but somethings missing...,"OK I admit when I got this CD I was not familiar with pre-""Meddle"" Pink Floyd, so hearing syd Barrett you think of some the weird early Who on acid(but I still liked it). The one song from that period that featured Roger Waters is the space blues ""Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun"". Then it jumps to ""Meddle"" to the long but no filler ""Echoes"" and the great semi-insturmental ""one Of These Days"". After that the songs are predictable but the inclusion of the pertinent ""When The Tigers Broke Free"" is very welcome. Still one can make the case for all of ""Wish You Were Here""(the album) and ""Speak to Me/Breathe/On The Run"",""Brain damage/Eclipse"",""Run Like Hell"", and ""On The Turning Away""(the best song on ""Momentary Lapse"")"
2,Why?????,"I am going to make this short. I am a HUGE Pink Floyd fan, and I must say that I am very disappointed with 'Echoes'. It lacks songs that people really need to hear. Songs like ""Have A Cigar"" ""Welcome To The Machine"" and also ""Run Like Hell"". My main reccomendation is to not buy this. If you want to start with something, start with Dark Side Of The Moon, or Wish You Were Here. Later, explore The Wall and all others. And one more thing, don't buy this only for ""When The Tigers Broke Free"". That has much more meaning to the movie than standing alone in a poorly put together ""hits"" compilation."
4,"Good, but could have been better.","This is a good album for someone who doesnt have the complete PF catalog. There is no reason for 4 post Roger Waters songs to be on this album. Especially when: Pigs On The Wing part III, Mother, Run Like Hell, Young Lust etc.... were left off.You can blame the record company and David Gilmore. Roger Waters had very little to do with this album. It could have been so great. But because of Gilmores ego, and desiere to one up Roger Waters it falls short!"
5,Beautiful,"This Cd rocks. Pink Floyd has been my Favorite band for a while. Classics like ""Comfotsbly Numb"" transport me to a far-away island. With one new track it is a great buy."
3,"don't need another compilation, need more live performances","Oh no! Not another 'best of' compilation. I already got all their albums, re-issues and other compilations. I also got hold of some of their unofficial live releases but the sound quality is pretty bad in most cases. I wish they would release more of their live performances instead, like ""Is There Anybody Out There?"", specially their older live stuff. I think every floyd fan would like to see and hear that.I've been a big fan of Pink Floyd ever since I first heard their music. I like all their older stuff specially. This is a great CD but not a true 'best of' in my humble opinion. There are so many other tracks that are ommitted, like ""Careful with that axe, eugene"", ""Green is the colour"", ""Cymbaline"" which they played almost all their earlier concerts, ""fat old sun"", ""If"", ""Let there be more light"", ""Cirrus Minor"", ""pillow of winds"" and so on.So, come on Pink Floyd, give us some old unreleased live stuff."
5,The Incredible Floyd,"This is not a ""hits"" collection the only hits they had were:See Emily PlayArnold LayneMoneyAnother Brick in the Wall part 2So, what about the other tracks?Maybe the band wanted to cash in on the greatest hits machine that's going around since the release of the beatles 1, or maybe it was that EMI wanted some money.Maybe or maybe not, but if you have this songs on your cd collenction don't bother to pick it up,it was hard to listen to echoes(the track) without 7 minutes of it. If you're starting on Floyd maybe you should buy it, or get it as a gift but don't spend 25 bucks on it if you're short on money.Great, but not so GREAT.Pink Floyd is the best."
1,another rehash,Great. Yet another Pink Floyd CD with Money and Another Brick in the Wall part 2 on it. Tasty.Has anyone else noticed that four out of Pink Floyd's last five CDs have featured Another Brick in the Wall Part Two?
4,A gripping read,This story gripped me from the start and kept me turning the pages well into the night. Lots of suspense and interesting material. I look forward to reading more of Tess Gerritsen's work.
3,Not her best work,"I am a Tess Gerritsen fan. I enjoy her writing style, her plots, her twists, her characters. But ""The Sinner"" fell flat for me.In an attempt to twist the plot, she introduces characters that have absolutely no bearing on the book -- at all. The characters appear, have their say, then leave, never to be seen again.She makes feeble attempts to start a plot line (case in point the relationship between Maura and Brophy), then doesn't do anything with it.This book had the makings of a good story, but she didn't go far enough to develop it, so it left me flat and wanting more.In all, this deserves three stars. Not her best, not her worst."
2,Same kind of writing style again - good till before end...,"So far I have read I think 6 of Tess's novels like Surgeon, Apprentice, THe sinner etc. Best I liked was The Surgeon and then the Apprentice. THis one starts ok and maintains some suspense but to be frank is no where near The Surgeon in terms of the thrill and suspense. I can easily keep this down anytime...but it was ok till last, however as usual the author ends the novel by opening the climax in just one page with no more details there. I feel she tries to build lot of things in overall novel but dont give some time to explain the climax....it just ends with no full explanation..."
3,the sinner,For some reason this book didn't hold my attention as Tess's books normally do. i guess it was the subject material. I just couldn't develop the compassion the book tried to instill.
2,An Uncharacteristic Showing,"I have been highly impressed by Tess Gerritsen's style of writing in her previous novels: Gravity, The Surgeon, Harvest, The Apprentice. Unfortunately, The Sinner does not carry with it the same level of suspense and excitement that has made her other titles absolute page-turners. In fact, there is nearly no suspense involved for the first 3/4 of the book, as the mystery tying together 3 seemingly unrelated crime scenes is unraveled at a painfully prolonged pace. Yes, this is more of an average quality murder mystery novel than the characteristically excellent medical thriller that has made Gerritsen a multiple-time New York Times bestselling author. Although The Sinner certainly is readable, I would recommend spending your time on one of Gerritsen's more acclaimed titles instead."
5,Pray for a rainy day....,"It's Labor Day weekend. Lots of outside plans. Lots of unexpected rain...and......that's a very good thing. Instead of walking the craft fair and barbequing...I got to stay in and read...the whole book.I have read both other books in this series, The Surgeon and The Apprentice...and The Sinner...is definitely my favorite to date. Very interesting plot, intermingling of characters, alot of twists and turns.I'm not an avid fad of reviews that tell you alot about a book so I won't.It's a great mystery/thriller.Just enjoy. I know I did."
1,Disappointing,"This was disappointing is so many ways: the plot started out nicely then took a huge wrong turn -especially when the ultimate villain was someone who would never have been allowed to be in the position he/she was in (I don't want to spoil the end for those who may want to read the book); both lead female characters were too ""pat"": strong women who excelled at that work, but were unlucky in love. A fast read, but in the end, a dissapointing one."
2,Wordiness kills this story,"I'll keep it short and to the point. The story itself would be OK, but this book is so incredibly wordy, I found myself saying ""shut up and get on with it"" too often. The author details everything, and what's worse, is redundant. I don't need to hear that the priest has strikingly blue eyes every time he's injected into the story. The story is further damaged by the reading of Dennis Boutsikaris. Any sentence that started with ""yes"" or ""no"" was articulated ridiculously. Nobody talks like that and it gets very irritating very quickly listening to someone read like this. I only finished these CD's because I invested too much time listening to the first 3 while giving it a chance. Strip away all of the nonsense and tell the story with a little more precision and it would be a pretty good book. But with the extreme excessive wordiness, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
3,JUST OKAY!!!,"The story starts out like gangbangers and then for some reason the author gets into a little to much about the personal lives of the medical examiner DR. Isles and Detective Rizzoli, which I think takes away from the story. It's not a bad story and there are some really excellent parts, but this is not Tess Gerritsen at her best."
4,The Sinner,This book grabs you from the beginning. Rizzoli and Isles make a perfectmatch to catch a killer once again! Awesome read.
1,Apathy,"I must have been reading a different author than the rest. The Bone Garden shouldn't have seen the first printing, The Surgeon and The Apprentice are okay due to the appearance of Mr. Hoyt. The Sinner inspired the deepest apathy in me of any book I have read in years. A quarter way in I realized that I didn't care one single bit about Jane, Maura, the victim, the nuns, Gabriel Dean or any of the plots surrounding them. If you like Tess Gerritson you will probably like this book... I personally just don't see the appeal though. Wordy writing, blazingly boring action, and characters that suffer from being totally unlikeable."
2,Paper Thin,"The plot starts well, the situation is palpable, and there's the usual drip of medical information so we feel like we're inside the autoposy room with somebody who knows the inside scoop. In the end, everything is just too nifty. The fact that all of this actions takes place within the confines of these few characters set new standards for the word 'contrived.' Mix in a stiff main character who doesn't know what she wants from men, and who lets an old one back in much too easily, and you have the recipe for a leaden story and a big, long yawn."
5,Love it,Great work. Had me hooked from the beginning. Another great read. Can't wait to read the next one. I'm going to finish the series before she writes another..
4,Good Read!,"Two nuns are attacked in a quiet chapel. One is dead, the other is severely injured. It seems to be a motiveless crime. When, another woman is found murdered in an abandoned building, a tenacious link is made between this murder, and the attack on the nuns.This book is well written. You can almost feel the claustrophobia in the scenes, that are set in the Abbey. The two main characters, medical examiner, Maura Isles, and, homicide detective, Jane Rizzoli are quite believable too."
3,The Sinner,Certainly not one of Gerritsen's best books. The story line spends too much time going into the personal lives of the medical examiner and Jane the detective. I kept reading to find out if / how the totally unrelated crimes where related. This is the saving part of the book.
4,Saints versus Sinners,"I picked up this book in a hotel in SE Asia from a bookshelf of books other travellers had left behind. I have never read any of her books before but this fully engaged me. I don't find it in the least bit 'slow'. In fact I savoured the intimate inner thoughts of the main two protagonists. I felt they were relevamt to the story and their personal lives interwined into the story.The first few chapters lead us to believe one thing and then we discover it's far more far flung and complicated. As far as the plot goes I think she's written a very viable (based on history) scenario. The only problem I have is near the end where (not wanting to spoil), a hitherto unknown sprimgs up out of the blue.Otherwise, I thought it was quite a fine story and well-written. I now have to read some previous ones which, according to some reviewers, are better. I hope I won't be disappointed."
5,The Sinner,"The Sinner (Jane Rizzoli, Book 3)This is a real page turner. The characterization is excellent and defined. Tess Gerritsen is a brilliant author.This is the third book in the series. The first is ""The Surgeon"" followed by ""The Apprentice"". These books are best when read in chronological order, but also stand alone."
3,Somewhat of a letdown...,"After reading and loving The Surgeon and the Apprentice, I found this book somewhat of a letdown. It just didn't have the suspence that the first two books in this series offered. I thought it was too much of a dive into Dr. Isles and Jane Rizzolis personal relationships with men, and not enough of a good suspence plot. Hoping the next one is as good as the first two!"
3,ok thriller and bad melodrama,"I can't call this novel a thriller for the simple reason that most of it is about feelings and love affairs of two main female characters (police officer and medical examiner. These characters are also in other books by this writer.) I didn't find it very exciting (on the other hand, I am not a big fun of this genre). The rest (whatever is left) of the book is good enough thriller. The author is definitely knows the subject (I understand she is a doctor of internal medicine) and the novel effectively conveys the grisly details of the murders. I found the ending to be a little bit stretched though. Recommended only if your love of medical thrillers can overcome the presense of many pages of nonsignificant melodrama."
3,Not Tess' best work,"I love the series with the M.E. and all of the characters, but this one wasn't one of my favorites. When can we expect more in this series?????"
2,Disappointing.,"I've had issues with her other books, but have kept reading. This book was a major step down from her other work. I found the character of Maura Isles to be a tired rehash of other ME characters and I found the rest of the people/plot elements to be both wooden and predictable.Maura has a series of very strained love interests which do nothing at all for the book and only function to irritate the reader.Gerritsen must be feeling the pressure to release work quickly, because I know from her other work that she can do better than this."
4,Great book!,"If you enjoy the TV series of Rizzoli and Isles, you will love reading about their adventures in a book. The characters come alive in Tess Gerritsen's novel.Looking for a good story, give it a try."
2,Disappointed,I love the TV program but was so disappointed that the books and the program were so different. Didn't bother to read the rest of the series that I bought!
5,The Best Blues albums EVER!,"I bought this album after watching the documentary of the same name. If you are a blues fan, order this DVD from Netflix today! All the blues singers on the DVD are accomplished and excellent, but Patrice Moncell knocked my socks off! How come I cannot find any other recording by her? Her version of ""Stormy Monday"" and ""Strokin'"" made my bones vibrate. In fact, do not play this version of ""Strokin"""" around any minors or adults who are easily offended. Other than a few spirituals on her website, I cannot find any other music besides these two cuts. Watching her sing in the documentary is lie watching a killer whale beautifully perform ballet! All of the cuts are great - the blues performed the way they were meant to be sung. If I could only own one blues album, this would be it!"
5,"A great DVD to orient you to the ""blues"" in Mississippi","We bought this DVD before taking a driving trip from North Carolina to Jackson and up the ""blues alley"" in Mississippi to Clarksdale, and then up to Memphis. It is a wonderful thing to see this before and during such a trip, as the dialog and music gives you a real feel for this part of the South and its musical heritage. We knew the Subway was no longer in existence when we went, so appreciated at least being aware of the history of the place. We did go to Ground Zero Blues Club in Clarksdale, owned by Morgan Freeman who also narrated much of the DVD, and were really thrilled to be there and feel part of the culture, if only for a short while. If you take such a trip we can also recommend a CD of the songs of Robert Johnson, which we could listen to in the car as we drove. As I have never been a blues fan(not exposed to this type of music) and enjoyed it so much, I can only imagine what a real blues fan would experience seeing this."
1,NOT AS EXPECTED,Don't buy this if you are expecting to read something. There are a few words on each page. Don't waste your money.
5,It is a sad story but truthful,"The story was very touching. It made me cry. I felt her pain. It was well written and described the truth of a teenagers life. People can be cruel to those that are different. I hope in the next book I read with Amber, her luck changes"
3,Enjoyable version with a star cast,"Maybe Ghiaurovs' bass is just too forceful for the Don in this enjoyable live recording but he is on top form dominating the opera like only Siepi can and with the added bonus of the sublime Janowitz cooly seeking revenge in the most lustrous tones it is readily recommendable,Kraus being the model Mozartian tenor seems to relish singing beside her,Jurinac is evidently strained in her first aria (I've heard her sing so much better on disc) but she is right within the role, achingly so,only Bruscantini and Petkov(Commendatore)seriously disappoint,the former dry and colourless the latter far too wobbly,the quality of this live recording is average which also expresses the orchestra(not first rate but under Giulini very committed)."
3,"Nice songs, but not very interesting performances","I didn't find the performances on this recording to be very interesting. The songs are nice, the lyrics are great, but the arrangements and performances feel mundane. A big exception is ""The Man Who Never Jumped"", which has some really creative playing."
1,Crippled,"Mandatory driver signing renders this OS incompatible with just about any audio/video hardware you have, all for the sake of DRMming the entire signal stream. Crippleware at its finest."
2,Wait for Windows 7,"This OS has many problems. It has very limited drivers, simple things like binding a second address to a NIC just doesn't work, explorer inexplicably consuming 1.5 gigs of RAM, etc, etc, etc. I finally had to put my old XP machine back in service and I find myself using it over half of the time. If all you need to do is word processing, sending emails, watch videos and surf the web this is a good OS. However, if that is all you need to do you don't need Vista 64 bit. If I were to buy my new computer again I would have paid for the XP downgrade and waited until Windows 7 comes out. XP was a very stable and easy to use OS, Vista is not and doesn't look like it ever will be."
2,Vista the DOG,I was quite disappointed with this product as it is poorly supported by device manufacturers.Old hardware you might as well throw away if you purchase this.The Hardware to support this is just now getting to the market with drivers being released only now.Using this for an HTPC is an odd combo as the desktop is not very nice on a tv but Media center is outstanding on a tv. It makes you wonder if the desktop is going away eventually.If you lie DIY projects this is a big one. have fun
2,vista?,"I got Vista which was supposed to be compatible. If you are using Visual Studio, creating ASP.Net applications and connecting to Oracle databases you are out-of-luck. No solutions to that one."
3,vista 64 oem,"Received it from Amazon in 4 days. I would buy from Amazon again, but I would not buy this product. I loaded it up with no problem, it activateditself (it was checked to activate). When I tried to install a better video card it had to be reactivated. Microsoft refused so I had to phone a number and recite 56 numbers to a computer. Again I was refused and I had to wait for 30 minutes to talk to a human. He told me I wasn't permitted to update my hardware with the oem edition. He finally gave me 56 more numbers to type in. I used win64 oem and never had this problem ( I have update the hardware many times). Vista 64 works fine ( a little slower than win xp)but knowing I can't update to new hardware means I'll be going back to win xp64 from now on."
3,Great! But where are the drivers?,Work great and fast with my Athlon 64. But drivers are still lacking for scanners and other peripherals. Nobody tells you ahead of time that lots of things won't work with a 64-bit system. This may be a product for the future. But the future ain't here just yet!
1,The DVD i have to return it due to scrach that dont let it install,The DVD i have to return it due to scrach that dont let it install
2,Got a Palm? It won't sync,"I just got off the phone with Palm -- they have absolutely no products that will be compatible with this Microsoft 64 bit technology. No patches at all, either. So if you have a Palm -- watch out -- it will NOT work with this. Palm says Microsoft issue. You will not be able to use any Palm software at all. That means if you have a palm PDA, it will forever be stuck in the PDA and not go onto your computer at all, if you get this software."
5,64 bit vista,"Vista is now the Windows standard, and rightly so. It comes with many features to let the user interact more comfortably and personally than with previous versions of Windows. Service pack one is out now and many of the errors that ruined earlier versions have been corrected. The only one ""problem"" I have come across is that the 64 bit version is a complete system hog. I have to 2GB of RAM and idle Vista alone uses 38% of that. In addition, there are a few programs out there that do not work with 64 bit operating systems, but the vast majority however have converted their products to be 64 bit compatible. Not really a problem but worth mentioning. Overall a great product."
4,"One of his best ""ambient"" albums","This was made to be played on a 3 speaker system...so if you have a ""wide stereo"" or ""music expansion"" button on your player push it and you will not believe all the hidden sound that appears throughout this dark and beautiful CD!One of the best(ie;most interesting)ambient releases by Eno.A lot of variation here between songs,and the tracks don't go on ""forever"". As one other review says here,it is not always a pleasant ,""new age"" ambience...but some dark visions are nice for a change too.A great place to start for those interested in Eno's version of ""ambient""...if you like this,then get Eno's ""Music For Films"" too(or try and find the ""Eno and Cluster"" CDs).More cool stuff!"
5,A Must-Have Masterpiece,Brian Eno is the greatest of the unsung musical geniuses of the 20th Century. Eno's audioscapes fall somewhere between soft wind and the rarest cognac. A treat for the ears and the soul. This album should be part of any serious audiophile's record collection.
4,Sonic architecture,Brian Eno knows how to bring background music into the foreground. I'm reminded of David Behrman. The mood is also similar to the Eno/Fripp collaborations; soothing music that will also make you think.
5,"FYI, dudes","I went to sleep to this album and track 4 (""Shadow"") gave me the creepiest, most unpleasant dream EVER. I was on an abandoned cruise ship late at night, and my dead mother (who's not really dead) was singing and rocking baby me in her arms. Awesome record, but...I mean...just a little heads-up. Listen to it awake."
3,Very good,"Classic Eno Ambient. Obscure, fuzzy, hidden behind layers of acoustic fog and quasi-natural ostinato. Particularly good is track 4, ""Shadow."" I won't spoil the surprise at who is ""singing"" on that track; you will have to read the credits."
4,This is one hot book!,"I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys hot, lesbian erotica with an s/m slant. Very entertaining, though it should have been proofread a few more times. Typos abound."
1,Movie wouldn't play,Movie wouldn't play in any of my players.Th players says wrong reigon.I am a huge fan of Linda Florentino.
3,An okay way to spend 90 minutes,"This movie i have to admit is kind of interesting, but i just wish it would have been more surprising, becauase I feel like I've seen this kind of movie millions of times. it kinda disturbed me because of all the recent sniper killings going on in the Washington DC area (where this movie predominately takes place), that they saw fit to release this movie a couple of weeks after the killings began. But hey, if you like Wesley Snipes and you have 1 hour and 36 minutes to spend, then rent this"
2,Bring on PHONE BOOTH.,"This film, which is very similar in plot to PHONE BOOTH (The upcoming movie witH Colin Farrell tat was delayed due to the Washington murders) only made me long to see PHONE BOOTH taht much more. This film has a good plot that's pretty much just wasted on nothing. Isn't it funny that Wesley SNIPES is playing a SNIPER? How'd they come up with tah clever bit of casting? Hmmm....okay, Fox, you can go ahead and put out Phone Booth now."
4,"Propaganda, but well done.","Okay, so I haven't seen the DVD yet (that would be impossible) but I DID see ""Liberty Stands Still"" just now on Max. It's propaganda (the father of a victim of the Colombine Massacre turns out to be a CIA sniper/demolitions expert and commits a terrorist act against an arms manufacturer- about as hyperbolic as it gets), but that doesn't detract from it being a fascinating (action)-thriller truly worth Snipes' talent at dark-world-weirdo-with-a-big-shiny-weapon roles.Must-buy for militant gun control advocates, Snipes fans, those who find patiently-waiting-for-death scenes cathartic, and anyone who gets cheap thrills watching Hollywood telling the sheep what to think."
1,The worst!,"I have most of this band's music, and have always appreciated everything they've put out. But this was their worst effort ever. The music isn't horrible, but the singing is off key, and the songs just aren't developed well at all. Buy anything else by them, just not this one!"
4,Great Book,"Ladies, if you're a victim, read this book. (And I say ""Ladies"" because--despite what the woefully misinformed individual below tells his ""clients""--women DO make up the HUGE majority of victims.)"
4,First buy of a Barefoot Contessa Book,"Reading the reviews, I received what I expected. The price was right.I have some books on french cooking & and some I just looked at where I had to assemble more than 20 ingredients/pluck some fowl myself etc. Sometimes you want it simple. One irritation - not just in this book. What about these green lentils such as du Puy. Where can they be had if you can't cook in France? I stay in Paris a few days on my way back to the USA from Europe. If I got them there they may not be allowed into the USA. Is there a substitute available or if not, is the dish worth doing? Reference to truffels I have to ignore.I would agree that the Ile Flottante recipe could cause an unpleasant surprise if caramel is left at room temperature as suggested. I follow a recipe where the caramel is poured into a pan and the meringue baked in it. This can be prepared ahead and then served with crème anglaise or any other - like raspberry sauce for my family."
5,French-phobic finding delight in this book,"I've never even opened a French cookbook before because I've always assumed I was too unfamiliar with that style of cooking. My mother-in-law has had this book sitting on her coffee table for months and as I started paging through I started falling in love. Together we made the scallops for her husband's birthday and the family was raving for weeks. I can cook French food! She's now given me my own ""Barefoot in Paris"" because while she loves to look at the pictures she knows how much I love to cook. I think my fear has always come from not knowing the methods or ingredients but these recipes are full of flavors I already use! I am a fairly experienced cook so much of it makes sense to me. I would be concerned for someone who is unexperienced in the kitchen being misled by the ""easy"" part. It's easy French cooking, but that doesn't make it easy cooking in general. I'm looking forward to venturing out to more Ina books."
5,Why Buy Ina,"I buy Ina's books because they are full of energy and warmth. The recipes work, they're delicious and she and Jeffery seem to live a warm life."
2,Below Expectation,"This was my first Barefoot Contessa book (it was a Christmas gift) & I have to confess I'm pretty let down.First off, the book is rather anemic. For the price, promise, and reputation I expected at least a few more recipes, and something more original. Easy doesn't have to mean boring or common. Also, for a cook book I don't expect an already slim menu to be falsely fleshed out with drink recipes (and a Kir is the best they could do??) and personal anecdotes that really come across as a little too self-centered.I'm not inclined to buy any more of her books, certainly not at full price, without taking a thorough look at it in the store.I agree with the earlier reviewer who suggested that this book is best for beginners. Anyone with even moderate culinary experience in European cuisine will probably be bored.Pretty pictures do not a great cook book make!"
3,I love Ina and sadly returned this book to Amazon.,"I have never been a fan of French cooking, but since I love Ina Garten and her 3 previous cookbooks, I was ecstatically looking forward to this one. I got it, read through the whole book and returned it to Amazon the next day. I really enjoyed the text and it makes me want to fly to Paris tomorrow, but there was not one recipe in the whole book that I wanted to try. I collect cookbooks and try lots of new recipes, but this one just didn't do it for me. I can't really put my finger on it. I guess my advice is if you aren't fond of French cooking to begin with, this cookbook won't make you any more enamoured of it. I thought it might make me a convert because I love her other cookbooks so much, but sadly it didn't. I give her an A for effort and storytelling. I am sure the recipes are delicious if you can get that far!!!"
4,Excellent Primer,"I gave Ina 4 stars this time around because this is by far her weakest book. It is true that this isn't ""stuffy"" French food, but stick to your ribs French country cooking. I love all of Ina's publications and all of her recipes have turned out at or above expectation. The one thing that Ina's food has that many other home chef books lack is flavor. She is not afraid to use big flavors together to attain fantastic results, yet at the same time it is amazing what salt and pepper alone can add to a piece of meat. If you're looking for down to earth French food buy this book and you won't regret it."
5,Ina Garten excellent as usual,"The book arrived on time, to no surprise. Standard Amazon practice, one could say.Ina Garten is excellent as usual; simple, systematic, clear and doable. The lady knows her recipes, and practices what she preaches. It is a pleasure to read, follow and to enjoy the dishes. Thank you.js"
4,Well Done Book,"I have really enjoyed this book. I am a fan of great pictures of the finished dish so I can tell if I have made it correctly, and this one has many. The recipes are not intimidating and are flavorful as well as appetizing to look at. It got me inspired to have a dinner party."
3,nice to have but not a gotta-have book,"I was disappointed with this book. I LOVE Barefoot Contessa recipes but her newest cookbook is more a collectible for her fans than a practical cookbook. For the price, I would like more recipes I could actually make rather than a picture book of her in Paris."
3,"Too much bragging, not enough recipies-though they are good!","Like others I got this book for Christmas and couldn't wait to go through it and make some recipies out of it. While the ones in here are excellent--there just isn't enough of them. And Ina, please don't turn into Martha Stewart with your bragging about who's who that you know. It's great that you have all these things and know all these people but I would bet 80% of those of us who are buying this don't have an apartment in France or know all the celebs she does. More recipies would have been nice as well but as I said the ones in here are pretty good and can be made even by my husband with little thought."
2,"A bit thin, but classic Garten","I found the book a bit thin in both content and quality. Most of the hints (Table dressing, flower arranging, etc.) and recipes are very American and not all that unusual to the American public. I agree with the other reviewer, enough of the name and place dropping, let's just get down to what really matters.But she is still her sweet self and I'll keep the book, but supplement it with some French bistro and Provincial cookbooks."
4,Redundant,"I really didn't find enough new in this book to merit the expense. I have her other 2 cookbooks and really use them..This one, sadly, sits on the counter without a stain on a page."
2,Very disappointed,"I LOVE Ina's first 2 cookbooks, Barefoot Contessa, and Barefoot Contessa Parties, however, this last book ""in Paris"" is a big disappointment. None of the recipes are really French, and also seem like some of them are repeated from previous books. How about LESS PHOTOS of Ina, and some original, delicious recipes. I will be giving this away as a Christmas gift! Not a keeper for my collection."
3,slightly disappointed,"i preordered two copies of barefoot in paris as i find her three other books indispensible. i was somewhat disappointed as i felt that a number of recipes were repeats from her other books. also, there were very few recipes that i want to run to the kitchen and try where i was thoroughly inspired by the others. maybe my expectations were too high."
5,Wish I Were There,"As I was reading Ina Garten's BAREFOOT IN PARIS and drooling over the recipes, I wished I were in Paris experiencing what she did/does.I am pleased that the recipes are easy to prepare with such delectable results. This book will be a great gift item for other AmericanFrancophiles."
2,Barefooted Nightmare,I have a paralyzing fear of French cooking being done while barefoot. What if one of the rich and fancy sauces were to fall to the floor and land on the cook's dirty toes? And then what if he/she were to wipe that sauce off his/her feet and put it back on my food? That could clearly be avoided with the proper footwear.
5,Barefoot Contessa,"I now have all of her cookbooks and watch all of her shows on the food network.The suggestions she makes, beautiful pictures, and can do recipes are great. Anyone can cook with her recipes, and appear to be a gourmet cook.Also wonderful shots of Paris.Best Price I could find on this cookbook was Amazon, and free shipping, think of the gas I saved.Enjoy and Bon AppetiteSherry"
4,Great Easy French Inspired Foods,"I love this cookbook, but probably not for the right reasons. I love it because it again possess' Ina Garten's warmth, wit and passion. Most of all though, it is about Paris and French food. Simple, great food that you can prepare at home without having to attend a culinary institute. The problem is, I have used it very little, which means that alot of the recipes are not as suitable for families as her other titles.At this stage in my life, I am still cooking nightly for a husband and three hungry children which means they are less inclined to try something new. So this is a cookbook for great easy french inspired meals but not necessarily for the average weeknight fare I have raved about in Barefoot Family Style and Barefoot at Home. At any rate, it is still a definite for your collection and bon appetite!"
2,Least Favorite,"While I have all of Ina's previous cookbooks and use them frequently, this is a cookbook that I can't say I've made much use of at all. The recipes don't have as much appeal to me as the recipes from her prior books. They seem a bit fussier to make (in keeping with French cooking, no doubt), but not only that, the food itself simply doesn't seem as appetizing. I realize this is simply a matter of taste, but had I actually spent the money to purchase this book (I received it as a gift), I would have been extremely disappointed. Perhaps my day to day life doesn't call for recipes such as Bouef Bourguignon and Filet of Beef au Poivre. And as charming as Ina can be, reading the personal details of her idyllic life with Jeffrey in France does get just a tad bit nauseating...I would highly recommend sticking to food, and particularly the food that Ina made so popular in the Hamptons."
1,"Good selection, but disappointing quality","I chose this disc as I was looking for a good genearl Peter Dawson compilation and it contains most of Dawson's better known songs. However when I listened it, it became obvious that the recordings had been filtered out to such an extent that it removed ALL the crackle from the original 78's. In doing so, it also removed all of the higher frequencies of the recordings. The end result was rather like listening to the music whilst wearing ear-plugs! The original character of the recordings has been completely lost. It's better to leave some of the crackle and be able to hear the words clearly."
1,just the facts,Didn't enjoy this style of writing or presenting facts. Very dry book. Bought it for my mother who likes reading true murder mysteries and she couldn't get through it either!
4,Browsed through and was fascinated,"I was surprised to find this dull-sounding book to be remarkably interesting to someone who has little knowledge of the topic. I came across the book with Amazon's new search system ""inside the book"" which was being checked for ""Sarawak"" and ""Abell."" It is a very interesting overview of the nature of power and influence within government: the unelected people behind the scenes in the civil service often being the real movers and shakers and instilling their ideas of realistic policies on the crafting of political will. BTW: there is a mistake when one of the British interviewees refers to the Abell brothers, Sir George was at the Bank of England and Sir Anthony was the Governor of Sarawak."
4,Translated Titles for non-speakers,"It's frustrating to love a song and not be able to listen or understand the words or title. So here's the titles in roomaji.01.

3,"An Average, Camp Suspense Film","As we all know -- this movie did not win an Oscar. However, if you are a person who loves Drew and/or need to kill time I'll say it would not hurt to watch this one. Basically the reviews are spot on with how negative they are about the picture, I'm being nice giving it three stars but since it's mainly a B-movie quality and Drew Barrymore does everything in her power to make this film work, I gave it an average rating. Thankfully this movie did not hurt Drew's career as she was finally getting her life back in order after years of drug abuse."
3,Watch out for the edges!,"Length:: 2:24 MinsThis is a decent filter, but the cut metal edges are rather sharp. I added a nylon to mine for added filtering, but even without the extra layer, it works fairly well. In the video I demonstrate the difference with and without the filter on a mic. The only problem is that, since I wasn't wearing headphones I didn't realize that I was too close to the mic and over-modulated, so the test is a little extreme.PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. So, please vote (The ""Was this review helpful to you: Yes or No"" buttons) and leave a comment if you'd like, even if it's just to say, Hi!"") When you leave a comment, I can go to your reviews and pay you the same courtesy.Thanks, Claire"
4,Phenominal Rock Record,"Album rips from start to finish. Less directionless tunes than Vs. Drums are always intense and interesting as in the opener ""2wice."" MOB is the Cream of art-punk, losing some of the textured shredery for a fresh live dynamic. MOB also tactfully rediscovers previously charted relevance in a neo-Regean American social landscape. Say ""The Obliterati"" whenever you find yourself in a discussion of old rock hacks reuniting ie Blondie and The New Cars."
4,An Entertaining Legal Thriller,"This is the second in the 'Chambers of Justice' series by Craig Parshall. As with the first one, this is well done.The plot centers around the child welfare authorities trying to remove parental custody based on an allegation of terrible child abuse. There are many twists and turns throughout. The courtroom drama is great as is the rest.In addition to being a legal thriller, this book explores many spiritual issues. The lead character, Will Chambers is a fledgling Christian who is working on his spiritual life in addition to the action in the main storyline. That part is well done also.I will certainly be checking out more books in this series. I recommend this book, but readers should probably start with 'The Resurrection File', which is the first one in this collection."
3,Second book is second best.,"The theme is hackneyed and the plot is thin in this second novel from Parshall. Parents are pitted against the state (children's services) over the welfare of their child. All the pros and cons of parental authority and control are brought out. Characters are underdeveloped and serve only to get the author's point across. Even lead counsel WIll Chambers seems like a cardboard figure, especially in his developing ? relationship with CHristian singer Fiona. There's better Christian fiction and better court-room drama to be had."
5,The best of The Penguin Cafe Orchestra,"This debut release from Penguin Cafe Orchestra is by far the best of all their records, with ""Music From"" following.Last song, side one, is stellar."
4,Great music,"it's that simple, this music is fantastic, especially during a lazy Sunday where chill music is needed!"
5,Great Listening!,The Penguin Cafe Orchestra is a very good CD. It's great music to work or relax by or as a background to a party. Their selections are varied and well put together.
2,Mainly frigid,"2 1/2Most of the album maintains nothing above highbrow pseudo-cultural background, but PCO works its way up towards something more meaningful, culminating only in the potent success of a final track."
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,"1/2/05- This is the first CD I've gotten mixed by the Happy Boys, and it is probably the last. The reason why I wanted to check out this CD was because I had heard the songs Derb and Addicted to Bass on other CDs, both of which I like and figured that this could be okay also. The majority of these songs did not interest me at all. Songs on here like ""Supadupafly,"" ""Operation Blade,"" and ""On the Move"" are just not really what I'm used to hearing. But, this is the first CD I've ever gotten with the title ""Techno"" on it. Normally my CDs are entitled House or Trance or Club but never techno. Oh, yes, and the mixing is not very good.6/3/05- In response to the review after mine... I did not get the CD just to listen to Addicted to Bass and Derb, I got it because I thought it would have other goods songs as well. Please read reviews CAREFULLY before you just make a response to them."
4,"Good, Solid Beats","Despite the extremely cheesy title, Techno Party vol. 1 is worth a look. Not every song is a gem, but there are some great tunes that are extremely fun to dance to. My personal favorite is Supadupafly, and Don't Go is very catchy.While many of the songs on this CD have better versions floating around out there (Alpha Twins' Smack my Derb is better than this album's version, which is just Derb), Techno Party vol. 1 collects several favorites in the genre. Definitely worth your time if you enjoy electronic music."
3,Rockin' Compilation,"The ""Party"" in ""Techno Party"" is exactly where this album falls in the midst of similar various artists compilations. It's a really rockin', pumping beat, aggressive mix of techno music, perfect to keep you awake while working out, hacking on your computer, etc. I have to give it three stars because, as good as it is, a compilation techno album like this one that isn't groundbreaking simply doesn't have the lifespan to merit a higher ranking."
2,disappointment,I buy a lot of the Happy Boys cd's and expected this one to be equally as good. It was disappointing to say the least. Derb is probably the only song I cared for.
3,"Typical trance-laden tracks with no original flow, should be called Trance Party","I hate picking up these CDs and always seeing techno imprinted on it, like ""this CD is packed with great techno songs"" and no one who released the CD knows the difference between techno and trance...or they do and like misleading the public. Either way, the CD wasn't horrible.I love the Ferry Corsten, Rhythm Gangsta, Marco V, and Warp Brothers' tracks, but the rest fall short in originality. I've heard songs like the one released by Jimmy Goldschimtz and Aquagen far too many times to listen to the whole song anymore. And tracks like 4 Clubbers released just ripoff New Order's remixed song...terrible. I'm not one for remakes of songs like ""Don't Go"" by Andre Visor, so I won't critique it anymore than they all should be destroyed.If you want a better collection of techno variants, try something by Digital Empire, like any of their first volumes of tracks. That would make for a more well-rounded party techno."
4,Getting Close to Ideal!,"This disc demonstrates one thing that DVD can do very, very well. While the narrator drifts through a series of images of patingings, sculptures, etc., you are free to PAUSE wherever you wish. This is a wonderful way to view an art program, and the TV screen is a lovely way to look at artistic materials (with its inner glow, it shows off the images). A TV tour is NOT the same as a museum, but few of us actually live in St. Petersburg, and a program such as this can be a worthy substitute.The materials are loosely grouped by nationality and by period (high renaissance is one 1/2 hour program, Spanish masterpieces another, etc., etc., etc.). Menu access is easy.In short, this is a fine presentation of a fantastic museum collection, and highly recommended."
5,A UNIQUE SONIC CELEBRATION,Impressive and wonderful sophisticated LATIN JAZZ MUSIC from monster bassist Santi debriano and his splendid band .Everything here welcomes you in a warm world of emotion excitement and humanity .A TREMENDOUS disc full of beauty and grace so nice like a musical prayer .WHOM TO GIVE THE BEST CREDIT FIRST FOR THIS STELLAR RECORDING TO THE WONDERFUL BASSIST SANTI DEBRIANO ? TO THE AMAZING TENOR SAXOPHONIST ABRAHAM BURTON ? TO THE GIFTED VIOLINIST MIRI BEN ARI ? TO THE FINE PIANO PLAYER HELIO ALVES ? TO THE EXCELLENT DRUMMER WILL CALHOURN OR TO THE CHARESMATIC PERCUSSIONIST WILLIE MARTINEZ ?.They all shine equally in this masterpiece which IMO is one of THE BEST latin jazz releases ever came out worldwide.
4,The Last Two Episodes are Worth the Price!,"A very good film, for the most part! However, The first two episodes are not very good. "" Little"" Franky Shaeffer tried to be too creative and emotional, and the results are kind of a joke for such a serious subject. Some of the animation and music are pretty offensive as well. Franky should have kept the same format as "" How Should We Then Live?"" The last two episodes really great!"
5,Love it!,"I LOVE this shampoo! It is great on my 2 1/2 year old daughter's long/getting think hair.It lathers up very well, smells very good (and not like fruit or flowers/which I love), and leaves her hair super silky and shiny. My daughter has good hair to begin with, but this shampoo makes it even nicer :)"
5,At last a cd to replace old vinyl!,"I was thrilled to see what is one of my all-time favorite albums released on cd. My vinyl is scratched from heavy use. This album is the forerunner of what became progressive rock later. Every track is good, and to my mind, the best album from the band. Too bad they couldn't use the original cover which was a big fat bird painted in the style of Bosch."
3,Oh Bernadette!,"Bernadette Peters is perhaps the greatest theatrical actress of the last 100 years. This concert which is probably from the very early 80s was held in Canada. The track listing is as follows: 1. Wake Up and Live2. If You Were the Only Boy3. Musical Movies Medley*Little Miss Nobody4. Betty Grable5. Broadway Baby6. He's Sure the Boy I Love7. Other Lady8. Harold Arlen Medley:* Blues in the Night* Let's Fall in Love* Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea* Stormy Weather* Get Happy* Over the RainbowThis is actually a DVD with a free CD, and although that is nice, this performance is the weakest I've ever seen the kewpie doll maven perform. The musical arrangements are poor, the jokes aren't funny, and the audience doesn't laugh. Bernadette also cries nearly after every song she sings!The DVD has very little extras with a brief biography with horrible misprints."
3,It All Depends...,"If you are a fan of Bernadette because of her magnificent stage career, this isn't the DVD for you. However, the performance itself isn't bad. She sings beautifully, fluttering lightly through the softer songs and belting out the pop ballads. Bernadette does cry during the show, but it doesn't seem to be from disappointment- her cheeks are wet only during the sad songs. To newer fans of Bernadette Peters, I recommend against buying this DVD; to veteran fans, consider what you like about her. Is it her show tunes? Is it her voice, no matter what the song may be? As I said before, the performance itself isn't bad. Bernadette sings beautifully, but it's not like her performance at the Royal Festival Hall in 1998. It's not necessarily worse, it's just different. Basically, I cannot say whether or not you will like this DVD. It all depends on what you like about Bernadette Peters."
5,The Nicest Christmas Sound Ever,"Ever since I can remember, this album in peticular was always played in my parent's house. My father would not play Christmas music until Christmas Eve. So when I heard this I knew it was Christmas!! It brings back alot of fond Christmas memories for me. Recommended to everyone."
5,Farm Journal Cookbook,"I have personally had this cookbook for years. It has some great recipes in it. The Mile-High Biscuit recipe is the only successful biscuits I can make. They're the best. This year my daughter said if she got any cookbook it would be this one, so this was one of her presents. She was thrilled and I know she'll make recipes from it for years as I have."
3,too broad in scope,"by attempting to be everything to everyone, this book missed the mark. although useful in a few cases, the illustrations were mostly black and white, and the author list too long to provide good specifics. since most collectors choose to focus on a handful of writers this book may not suffice for them. As a general book, i think the cooper and pike book - collectors guide to detective fiction - is far superior."
2,VERY EARLY WAYNE,"CLASSIC JOHN WAYNE-IF YOU LOVE HIM, YOU WILL LOVE THESE COPIES OF THE ORIGINAL FILMS"
3,"Listed as new, but....","The CD arrived timely and in great condition - there were no scratches on the CD or the case. However, there was nothing indicating the product was ""new"", although that was how it was listed. I was disappointed as I had purchased this as a gift for someone."
5,5 stars for what is here. Complaints about what is missing.,"The original versions of both League of Gentlemen and God Save the King/Under Heavy Manners are superior to this release. I especially miss the League's complete album format.That said, this period of time for Robert Fripp was a defining moment. The original League of Gentlemen is the most astounding piece of ""Rock"" music ever produced. It elevated rock music to the heights of intellectual excellence never befor or since achieved. And you can shake your butt crazy dancing to it!Only the Gang of Four came close to what this record accomplished. A reinvention of rock and roll. A landmark.I am dissipointed that not all of it is presented here, and that Fripp and the rest of the league did not record more music.The guitar work on God Save the King is exhilerating, and yes.. more than a little bit scary.BUY IT... and then seek out the originals."
3,A Minor Disappointment,"I am a huge fan of Mr. Fripp and had the League of Gentlemen on vinyl when it was first released. I was fooled into thinking ( It IS the same cover ) that this was that release in it's entirety. The two songs I remember, and liked best, did not make it onto this compilation. Though still entertaining, I suffer an acute longing to hear Sara Lee whine her coke-whore story to me and it just isn't here. Drat.."
2,Not really outstanding,"Judging by all of the glowing reviews here, I obtained a copy of this EP and eagerly played it. By the end, I was confused between the impressions that I got from the Amazon reviews and what I actually heard myself.I didn't notice anything outstanding about this collection of songs. It sounds just like all of the other contemporary pop/rock that abounds on MTV nowadays. Maybe the 5 glowing reviews are written by the band members' families? This just didn't catch my ear.This EP is not awful, but it definitely is not 5-star material. It just blends right in with the rest."
4,Softball medals are great,The medals were what I hoped for.The girls on our team really liked them and were pleased when we presented them by hanging them around their neck by the colorful ribbon.The medal is a solid weight and clear design.They were shipped very quickly and were reasonably priced for a small quantity.
4,Has potential,"Attention-grabbing colours certainly attracted my Kakariki, but it is easily knocked over. Works well if you wire it to the side of the cage by its base. Putting treats in the carts assures some attention as the bird works out how to get the treats at the bottom. An interactive toy that gets a bird thinking. Runs smoothly, easy for a small bird to make it spin. A good toy!"
1,"Terrible production, terrible music",Wow this is really bad. First they should call it drum set duets because most of the playing is done with two drumsets or drumset + percussion. The music is really canny and would be most suited for kids cartoon show. I am not sure what the producer is trying to do here. I rented this DVD to see the drummers. All the camera does is wisk at the drummer and then it moves somewhere else.
3,Gross,"Honestly, I'm sure the tea works, don't really know. I have bronchiectasis and chronic asthma, yes... oh joy! So, I bought this, not really having much faith it'll work. But I guess it works, don't really know if it's this tea or my normal routine / slew of $550 a month of medications I take that's helping. But one thing I do know is that, I absolutely dislike the flavor, smell and aftertaste of this tea. It leaves a very odd aspertame (fake, cancerous sugar that used to be used as pesticide) on your tongue when you drink it. It's truly disgusting to me. Lots of good reviews on this tea and for the life of me, I can't figure out why as this tea tastes so nasty to me. To each his own! I guess if it works, it's all worth it."
5,herbal remedy for bronchial distress,"If you are having difficulty breathing due to a viral infection or chronic asthma, this tea is for you. I keep it on hand all the time in case someone in our family develops a cough.In addition to various Western herbs that support clear breathing, such as Eucalyptus and Pleurisy Root, the tea has the traditional Chinese herbal mixture Bi Yan Pan in it. This is the magic ingredient that helps clear mucous out of the lungs.I am grateful that Amazon carries the entire Traditional Medicinals line because sometimes it is hard to find Breathe Easy tea in stores. There are a variety of competitors on the market with other teas that claim to provide relief for breathing difficulties, but Breathe Easy outclasses all others I have tried. Plus, it has a pleasant flavor from Licorice and Peppermint, especially compared to other herbal teas that have perceptible medical effects. I highly recommend Breathe Easy tea."
2,Lifter,Never seemed to balance properly to work. Have to manually take the phone off the hook to answer the phone.
4,great product,I bought this to replace mine that was five years old. The old unit would only work half the time. The new unit seems to have even better range...working up to about 200 feet from my desk when I'm outside! We have three setups with Plantronics headset in our office and they work great.
3,set up,"Great product! Frees up hands and allows you to run around the office and still answer the phone. The sound quality is amazing, as well as the distance it covers. Setting it up was a breeze, took about 3 minutes.Only complaint is the sticky cushions to install runs out of stickiness pretty quickly. I repaired it with superglue."
3,"Pleased with the seller, less with the product","The item arrived in new condition, shortly after the order was placed.I had a great deal of trouble getting the microphone on the unit to pick up noise from the phone, which kind of defeats the purpose (there's a small microphone underneath the lifter which sends a signal to the headset when it picks up ringing, to let you know you're receiving a call if you're away from your desk... so since it wasn't picking up the sound, it wasn't sending the signal to the headset).Ultimately I got it to work using the included extra microphone (which attaches separately to the unit), and by turning up the ring volume, but I was somewhat frustrated by the need to use the extra microphone at all, as I was able to use the same model of lifter on another phone in the office without any trouble."
3,Picks up phone slowly,The product works well and just as it is described. The problem is that it lifts the phone too slowly for our sales staff. They all race to answer the phones and this lifter is too slow. So now they all have this lifter on their phones but have it disabled.
5,"Purchaser, not end user",The handset lifter is working great. Had a little trouble fitting it due to our style of phone. The user is very happy with it. Allows her to answer the calls without having to reach.
3,No good for RCA Executive Series 4 line phones,"I use the Plantronics Voyager 500A, which is great. The handset lifter is an obvious fit so you don't have to lift the receiver from the cradle each time. However, if you are using the RCA Executive Series - 4 line phone, or for that matter any phone hand set that does not have a high arch, the ""Lifter"" can not fit under the handset. The handset will not sit in the cradle or slides off the cradle. The added extender arm that comes with the Lifter does not cure the problem. I had to send the unit back for a refund. Great idea though, but know that is will not well or at all on such phones."
4,Love the capability - didn't fit my phone perfectly,"Absolutely love the capability... combined with my bluetooth headset that answers both my cell phone / office phone, i'm set. The only challenge is that I bought a phone (happens to be an RCA model) that it's outside is slightly curved. The mechanism that this device attaches with is with sticky double sided tape. Now, if the phone had a flat outside edge - it would work perfectly. Unfortunately, every few days it start to sag down and stays off the hook when I disconnect. Soon I may just superglue the thing into place! Just something to watch out for! Really do like the capability and recommend."
3,Excellent device,"This device does perform beautifully use after use. The only things I do not like about it is that if someone accidentally leans on the headset that the lifter has picked up, it will hang up the phone. Also, if you have to replace the phone that this is attached to it is a pain to get off and you have to velcro the device onto the new phone. Other than that it is a great work horse and is adjustable to the phone."
5,Works as advertised,it does what it says! Took a bit to get it working properly on our phone but that could be because of our phone type. very happy with it.
1,doesn't fit all phones,"purchased this for my wife to use at work. Unfortunately, it will not work with her office phone because of the design of her phone. We now have a fifty dollar useless piece of plastic. It does look like it would work if it would fit the phone."
1,Hard to install,Not sure how this works as it is too hard to install! This will not fit many phones.
1,Buyer Beware!! Item Fine... Seller the Issue!,Buyer beware! I ordered the item not realizing until it got to me that it was not the correct item for my needs... the seller refuses to allow a return! It's a $15 item for crying out loud! He says he can't afford to allow a return! I'm sure he doesn't have $15 in the item... and I am sure that he'll drop more than $15 on his lunch today! Making myself a note not to ever order from Portland Surplus again... but I will be kind enough to return his item to him... I can afford to allow him to re-sell it!
4,Little clunky but it does the job,The lifter is a bit big and awkward and sometimes slips out of alignment if bumped so the phone won't fit back down properly. Once it did that and I kept the caller on the phone and they could hear me when I thought it was hung up. But the convenience it offers - when away from the main phone and wearing the headset - is amazing for me. Worth getting if you have the headset.
4,Does what is says it does,have one at work and home...works just as it should...worth it if you are on the phone a lot and need to multi task on your computer
4,Necessary addition.,"This item was also purchased by my assistant in conjunction with the Plantronics head set. This feature allows her to answer and disconnect calls w/o lifting her phone receiver. It is also nice for those with small workspaces that may not have the room to place the phone receiver aside while making/receiving calls. The down side, is that it's not very ""universal"". It does not fit our style of phone very well, and it also covers the phones speakers. Nonetheless, she loves the convenience of it!"
4,It lifts stuff,"I don't have previous experience with a handset lifter, but this one certainly lifts the handset. It works just fine, and I enjoy the feature which rings the headset when the phone rings. It was a bit tricky to get the device positioned correctly with the double sided tape provided, but everything's still working well after a few months."
3,not good as I thought,"When I saw the product from the picture, I thought the product is able to clip into the phone. After I bought it, I found out that the product need to seal into the phone. I can not remove product from the phone, if I quit the job & can not transfer the product to my new job. Not convenience at all."
5,Should be a standard item on every phone,"The HL10 lifter works well, and keeps working. I've installed and used many of these lifters on Cisco 7940 and 7960 IP phones and have yet to see one fail. The unit is a perfect fit on the 7940 and 7960 phones. The included adhesive strips work, but do wear out after several years; The residue is also tough to remove if moving the lifter to a new phone. I recommend discarding the included adhesive strips and instead using two small strips of industrial strength Velcro. It will make removal quicker and easier, yet keeping the lifter firmly attached. The bottom side of the lifter is also perforated as to not block your speaker phone."
4,the desk of a person with a disibility,The Plantronics HL10 Handset Lifter was a great addition to the desk of a person with a disibility. This will help a great deal and make live a little easier on the job.
4,This is a FANs album only!,"Well, I am glad to have these, but they are NOT for casual listening.The performances are excellent, but the sound leaves LOT to be desired.Yes, I know that they are bootleg recordings, but the sound, for the most part is really poor. Mostly echoing, bassy boominess from the hall that these were recorded in.The one from 1977 (a sound board) is the exception, and is a really nice listen... there are flaws, but that is true with ANY soundboard tape.I hope that there are more of these releases, and maybe the quality of the boots will go up. I wish that they could have released the 1978 Nassau Coliseum radio broadcast, but I guess that they could not get the permissions to use it for this release.Maybe in the next bootleg release?"
3,better late than never,"I would say that overall for the true ELP ""freak"", that these Vol.1 and Vol.2 sets are a must have!! Yes, they are pricey but you are getting 8 cd's, and to me the sound quality is surprisingly good for something recorded almost 30 years ago on a smuggled in tape machine!! Unauthorized taping was highly frowned upon at the time with people's machines being confiscated!! I wonder how it goes for the royalties? Are the illegal tapers getting money off of this after all these years? Anyway these are must haves for the true ELP fan (ie freak)!!"
3,i can't beleive,"OK. I too saw ELP from 72-79. At first listen, I said to myself""how can someone sell this sh99?Later, I kicked back eQ'd the disc's and began to feel warm inside remembering the intensity of the band the shows I was listening to and the shows I saw.I saw ELP in NJ outdoors at Roosevlelt Stadium my first time I think 72 or 73 It was the most intense ""Fan-dangerous"" show I ever saw.(take my word for it)As with Early Floyd, ELP was using equiptment which was way ahead of the old ""mic on a crutch"" technique to get a decent recording.All in all, I'm happy to get this box set, but nothing can even compare to the shear MADNESS of an ELP concert.PS. If anyone has tapes of the roosevelt stadium shows in jersey I would like to hear them."
4,Polka Dots,"This was a good CD and fun to listen to. It wasn't the best, but it was all right. I like the title but I don't see how it relates to the songs."
2,"okay, lost in the mail & scratched","Had to call after almost 3 weeks to amazon about no delivery, was refunded shipping cost and product showed up a few days later. (1) song skips pretty bad (scratched). I will try again, Thanks!"
5,An absolutely delightful diversion...,"I had such a wonderful time accompanying Dorothy on her journey! Karen Mueller Bryson has written a completely beguiling tale of death, dysfunction, and renewal. With humor and compassion, Bryson brings an entirely delightful heroine to life. I couldn't stop reading until I found out what happened to Dorothy and to the fascinating people surrounding her."
5,One of the best ever episodes,"I totally agree with others that this is an absolute must for any Little House fans. Especially if you love Dean Butler as I do. One of the best.I also agree that it would be nice to have ""He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"" in this series. Also, how about ""Back To School"" Parts I and II that introduce Almonzo to the series. And, of course, ""Sweet Sixteen"", the episode when Almonzo finally notices Laura as a grown up woman and falls in love with her!!"
4,Durrell's 3D experience,"Another gem from Durrell -- sort of a prequel to Menagerie Manor -- in which he narrates his adventures in Africa where he went to scour for animals for this upcoming zoo. As usual, he describes the animals with such beauty that they pop-out of the screen and stream directly into your brain -- the best 3D I have ever experienced! His narrative is peppered with lavish doses of humor and his stoic narration simply adds to the mirth. Another short read that I thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommend!"
5,"If you like nature, laughing, or both, read this book","I would seriously recommend this book to anyone on the planet. Do you like nature? Read this. Do you like animals? Read this. Do you like humour? Read this. Are you someone who appreciates a good book? Read this. You will come away knowing lots of interesting facts about obscure animals,have sniggered your head off, and with vibrant images filling your head. This is an autobiography jam-packed with laughs and description."
5,Impossible not to like this book,"Really interesting. Whoever read ""My Family and Other Animals"" will recognize the fine humour and British causticity in all Gerry's books -- which, unfortunately, are very few. But of high quality, no doubt. Recommended."
4,Dennis,"A good product overall and I got the best price at Amazon, but I wish the item wasn't so expensive."
1,Never do business again,I want my money back this thing does not work never worked to begin with. Cannot use amazon.com to get in touch with the selller . I only got a responce when I did place a negative review of my transaction and then then did not even offer a refund nor a replacement.
5,so good,"buy this because it is a higher capacity cartridge print as well. Hey tried using remanufactured cartridges and if more work but I recommend buying new. I would suggest lower costs for manufacturers, sometimes tend to be very expensive."
4,Canon PIXMA PG-50 black ink cartridge,No problems with this ink except it's expensive for the amount one gets. Don't replace the cartridge when the warning comes on that the ink supply is low. There is considerable ink remaining at that point. I keep using the cartridge until what I'm printing shows that the ink really is running out.
1,Wrong ink for printer.,"This ink was suggested for the Canon MP460, It was the wrong ink when I finally received."
4,Work fine.,Work fine. Price is better than at the store. Exactly what I wanted and expected. Not much more to say.
5,Good product,I found it easy to install and it lasts a long time after warning the user that the ink is running out.
3,"Works, but expensive","As soon as there are third party options, I'm trying them. This is almost like the price of gold."
3,shows low ink,"Purchase was easy and delivery was timely. I bought high capacity thinking it would last longer. Within two weeks or normal or less than normal printing, black cartridge showed low ink warning. Would send it back but don't want to incur shipping charges. Will buy locally next time."
4,Name brand makes a difference,"I've used the non-name brand refurbished ink cartridges in my Canon MPC, and they just don't print as well. This one prints great."
3,short print life,"For a product that claims ""high capacity"" the number of pages I was able to print from it was rather disappointing. And this is even when I print most of my documents in ""fast"" mode."
1,Took bad advice from another review,"When ordering this product, I took the advice of a review which said the CL-50 held more ink than the CL-40. Unfortunately, my printer required the CL-40 and they are not interchangeable. Now I'm stuck with ink I cannot use and it was a rather costly mistake."
1,Check Printer,"I cant really say how good this product is, it won't work with my printer. Anyone out there, u need to check your printers before you order these high volume cartridges. MP470 will only take the 40 and 41 cartridge."
4,Entirely satisfactory,"This is an ink cartridge for my Canon printer. It came promptly, was installed not long thereafter, and is working exactly as it should."
4,"Great cartridge, but life seems short","I bought the larger cartridges because I had read that they last so much longer. However, after having used a couple of the more expensive cartridges (which cost 50% more than the PG-40) I am convinced they do not last 50% longer than the regular cartridges. In fact I saw very little difference. After examining the boxes, I realize that the larger cartridge only holds 22ml versus 16ml for the regular (37.5% more). It doesn't even seem to last a third longer to me.So I will purchase the regular cartridges from now on. Same print quality, but a better value.Texas user"
3,Make sure it is the right one for your printer,"I bought this high capacity cartridge because I read that it works with the Canon ip1700 printer. Apparently this is not true for US printers, but it is true for European printers. Unfortunately, canon support had no help for me, so I opted to manually put the ink from my new PG-50 into my empty PG-40. It was much easier than I expected, as I just had to remove the tops from both cartridges, and swap out the ink soaked sponge. A little super glue and scotch tape to hold the top in place so the ink didn't evaporate, and it worked great!After looking at the amount of black ink that the sponge had for both cartridges, it is apparent that the high capacity gives more ink per dollar, but it does take some effort to get it to work.Good luck, and I hope this helps."
5,Great Expose of Russia under Communism,"I was assigned to read this book in a Russian History class in college and fell in love with Russia and her people. It is a little out of date now if you are looking for what life is like under the New Russia. But if you want to read what life was in Russia in the 70's and 80's this book is an excellent resource.Kaiser is a journalist and gives a journalistic pov of the Russian people and their way of life. He gets past the surface of Cold War rheteric when Russia was closed to most of us in the West ansd simply just an ""Evil Empire"" of the old guard, and lets us see her people with their hopes, their dreams and their lives."
3,Good entertainment for little money!,"I enjoy most all programs about the air war in Europe, China and the Pacific. This DVD was interesting and I spent an enjoyablehour or so watching it. I think every youngster should have to watch programs like this so they will know how things were back in those days."
1,Mis Identifiation,Please know that this item is not what you are going to get. tokentraders will send you an activision game that is called Red Baron Ace of the Sky.Dealing with the frozen pizza. Not too much in the combat or action. BE AWARE OF THIS.Red Baron: Wings of Honoris made from citi interactive.
5,Furnished album for rent,"This album is great.I don't say that only becouse i like Nuno.I really like his new style and i think the songs are great.His guitar work is great as ever but his voice and lyrics have improved a lot.New drummer is great too.Songs are heavy,funky and melodic at the same time.My favorite ones are Furnished souls for rent,Upsidedownside,Monkey paw and Space,other song are great too but these ones are really awsome.Buy this album you wont regret it because it better than anything that came out these past years.Mourning Widows is wonderfull band that we were missing since Extreme was disbanded."
5,Cool CD but could have been better if Gary Cherone had sung!,"Listen, this CD is amazing with it's guitar work and it's melodys and in general it's musicianship. The only thing missing is a true singer with an in your face voice. Nuno is a good singer and that's about it, good not great. Nuno's former band Extreme had that great singer that appears to be absent from Mourning Widows. I am not saying we should have an Extreme reunion, but it wouldn't actually be a bad idea at this point in Nuno's career. Hey Nuno, you can sing, yes, but you need a GREAT singer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Nuno's Sounding Tired,"I know what he's capable of and this ain't it. Its a good album and I enjoy listening to it. Nuno sounds like he's taking the easy road out on this. Where are the fills, the intricate leads and riffs? Its good background music but I know he's got alot more in him. You won't regret the buy but you might be disapointed if your a Nuno fan. Just my opinion. For what its worth.Steve"
5,BUY IT! DONT DELAY!!,It is without a doubt the best record ive ever heard. Cant wait for the next one. BUY IT.
5,THANK YOU KIM JONN!,"So many people are struggling with the demands of daily living. They search in vain for some shred of hope that will provide a degree of peace and reassurance that their lives are not in vain. Now comes a book, ""How God Answers Your 911 Call,"" that provides this hope, this reassurance. Kim Jonn has done a masterful job of showing the reader that hope and reassurance come from the scriptures; that God's Word is the source of security in an otherwise insecure world. Her ability to relate everyday challenges to specific Bibilical references is both timely and insightful."
5,This album is the best!,This album is in my top 3. It is so well-written and beautiful -- no mindless pop tunes here. Buy it. Now!
3,Yet another budget release.,"This is another in a never-ending parade of budget releases of their four public domain shorts. If you're short on cash, and NEED some Stooges material, this is the best budget release of the ""four"" that I've seen. The picture and sound are, of course, substandard, but very much viewable. For $5, you can't go wrong! There is a regular-quality version of these shorts out on Fox, with color and B&W versions, for around $10, so get that one if you can spare the cash, as it has the ONLY regular-quality versions of the three Shemp episodes (""Disorder In The Court"" is available on Columbia)!!! The Shemp ones are: ""Sing A Song Of Six Pants"",""Brideless Groom"" and ""Malice In The Palace""."
3,Not anything new.,"If you are a first time teacher, maybe this book would be helpful, but I have taught 15+ years, and I really didn't learn anything new. I was hoping it would give strategies to help with ADHD students in the classroom, but not so much. It did give lots of research, which I wasn't really looking for."
5,"Expensive, but nice","We bought this for our almost 3 year old. A little pricey, although I understand that most of that is due to the CARS licensing. That being said, it has already gotten a lot of play by both of our boys...our oldest is 9 and also has been enjoying it.Lightening McQueen is a sturdy little car that can be played with on or off the Doodle Pro. My son LOVES to drive Mater across to erase.I did not think much, at first, of the 2 stencils that came with it. They have been a bigger hit than I thought, and they are very uniquely designed. Sturdy clear plastic with grooves to guide the doodle pen.I know from past experience that eventually the screen will show wear and the images will not erase as easily. I imagine this will bother me more than the boys, though.Great toy, catchy design, perfect gift for my son."
1,The Worst,"Buju is by far 1 of my favorites, and this DVD does not do him justice. I could not even watch the whole video before throwing it in the trash. The picture and sound quality are terrible and more than half of the video is people talking on stage. Do not buy this."
2,Why watch this?,"Terminally boring little indie, with almost no interesting dialogue and no action, though quite a bit of frontal nudity. This was all realistic, but I didn't see the point of watching it. What was the message? Why should we care what these two do about their long-distance relationship? It's almost reality TV, but why we would care to watch this is not clear, though watch it, I did. Now, I want my 75 minutes back."
2,Extremely Poor,"This product was extremely misleading in that no where in the product discription does it mention the fact that the wine rack is composed of unfinished wood. Had I known I would have to add a significant amount of time and effort to stain the product in addition to its assembly, I more than likely would have purchsed a different product altogether.An together disappointing experience."
5,macho? just normal !!,"Just ordered the CD...then...I rediscovered this album, hiding. It was pretty fine to hear strong music. you know...like you'd like to play sometimes for those moods. By the way, that song ""Macho"" is a funny name!! It's kinda normal for those who like Flamenco, i.e., Alive and Conscious!Get on YouTube with <Magyar Gipsy> via google...need to spend half a day or night. Check out the dancing and the music. After a few hours(?) put on ""Macho"" in MACHO, or, FACES - ""Desiring You"", (buy this) and turn the video sound off and check it out. Look how far he took it!! So fine. Everything he plays dances with the dancers from old to right now. He did it. He made the fusion of Time with Now. Dancing with Life and Living and Loving. Try Some Now. Get the Extra Tracks CD, yes."
3,"Hillsdale Montello Backless Swivel 26"" Counter Stool Review",The stool is great in terms of allowing me to eat at my kitchen counter and the color of the chair goes well with my floor and counters. I would prefer a stool that has a back if I wanted to sit in it for any length of time.
3,Pretty Good,"I'm a historical romance fan, but this book looked good so I took a chance on it. I was not disappointed. It's about a brother who marries his brother's pregnant girlfriend. I don't want to tell you the whole story, but you find out all about Meg & Nick and why they are the way they are. It's 297 pgs. But it seems alot shorter. Happy Reading!"
5,Terror In Texas...,"THE WILD MAN OF THE NAVIDAD cost nearly nothing to make, so how could it be so good? Because, it makes the best of its ultra-limited resources! Even though the creature is barely glimpsed, the local hicks are perverse drunks w/ guns, and the ""hero"" is a cowardly doofus; somehow, this combination works! I generally hate bigfoot, yeti, sasquatch films, so this one surprised me. Don't expect a zillion-dollar, hollywood spectacular, and you just might enjoy this one..."
2,Poor attempt at 70s horror,"Let me start by saying I LOVE the 1970s subgenre of horror/pseudo-documentary films. So I had high hopes for this one when they used a title card lifted from ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" about how this film had some of the real people playing themselves. But it all went downhill from there. The film is too mean-spirited to be campy or nostalgic, and too amateurish to be truly scary. It seems as if the filmmakers tried to combine ""Boggy Creek"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" - they did not succeed."
5,arthouse/grindhouse,"Not bad for a micro-budget 1st feature...I'll give it an ""A"" for ingenuity...& it really is a nice-looking film...I like the way they tweaked the digital imageryto almost fool you into thinking you're lookingat 16mm reversal blown up to 35to show on some drive-in circuit!& the thoughtfully cheezy script is nicely whack...Combine that with a brilliant supporting local cast& you're in for almost 90 minutes of free wheelin' no budget fun!the monster suit is pretty much film school surreal...& I mean this mostly in a positive way...You know the thing about how seeing the zipper in the monster suitbreaks the spell of our suspension of disbelief...Well, this monster suit is made of nothing BUT zippers!The result is a sort of dissociative archetypal thing that ends upslamming you face first into a real arthouse/grindhouse boogeyman...More fun than too scarey...which adds to the surreality...especially considering all the pig guts strewn around!Cool movie. Get it."
5,LOTS OF FUN!,"I bought this game for my daughter not too long ago and it is one she plays very often. Lizzie's alter ego goes on lots of adventures that keep the player and the game literally ON THE GO alright! There are many levels of adventure to advance through, making it a challenge, but not impossible to play and frustrating. It is just right for its target age group. How can you NOT have a good time, at the MALL?We took this one on vacation and it was good for hours of entertainment in the sun, in the hotel room, in restaurants, everywhere. Parents, you know how valuable it can be to have a child who is not BORED and has a form of entertainment. For you young fans of Lizzie McGuire reading this, I really think you too, will have alot of fun playing this interesting, colorful and entertaining Gameboy advance game. It is more expensive than most, but at least you feel you are getting something fun for your money!"
4,Lizzie Mcgiure Game,All girls who enjoy watching the show Lizzie Mcuguire will love the game. It is very fun and kinda challenging. There is a cool fun game on it called WHEN CHEERLEARDERS ATTACK! Well I think it's a fun game!! ENJOY!
4,It's pretty cool!,It's really fun and challenging. It gets hard on the levels when your timed. This is a great game for someone who wants a challenge.
1,Boring after 5 minutes,"this could have been so mush better then what it is. It;s a bunch of party games that you would normally play in a piece of paper but on a game screen instead. If you want an awesome game for a good sleepover party, or for just hangin out with your friends get ""Mary-Kate and Ashley Sweet 16 Licensed To Drive"" now that's what I call a entertaining and fun game!!!!!!"
3,fun in the bigging but.............,this game was so much fun in the bigging but got so annoying later cuz it keeps repeating the same things over and over. i wish i could give this a 5 but it is true.
5,COOL,"this game is soooo fun!! you get to do soooo many kinds of fun stuff. If you like Lizzie McGuire, then you'll like the game!"
2,A Lizzie Mcguire game? When will the madness stop?!,"I know I'm not alone when I say that the whole Lizzie Mcguire trend is getting WAY out of hand. I mean really, how could you make a game out of Lizzie Mcguire? All she does is crush on Ethan, get bossed around by cheerleaders, and get into fights with her friends. What could this game contain? Super mall shopping action? And I thought the TV show was pointless..."
1,Don't Buy into Lizzie,"It is a terrible idea to buy ""Lizzie McGuire:On The Go"" due to its basis. This game provides nothing near to quality entertainment. The graphics are bad, the plot is almost nonexistent and the gameplay lacks everything that would qualify it as a good game."
3,"cool, cool","i dont have anything to say about this game except that its fun. sure! why wouldnt a game with 20 games suck! oh yah! when the games are less than 20 seconds! this lizzie mcguire on the go is one of the worst but it has a couple of challenging games-ie:when cheerleaders attack! so hard. it took me 2 days to beat 20 levels! ha ha ha ha ha. im a bad gamer but this game is kinda not worth it, unless your a totall lizzie freak and would love to spend your mind on lazy games that take no brain power at all! good luck"
1,"Uhm, no","Here is a simple word for you people: this game was in Seanbaby's column in EGM. If that didn't convince you not to buy this game, then go ahead and buy it and learn your lesson the hard way."
5,Subtle Intense Jazz Chamber Music,"Haven't heard a trio album ever sound so complete. Perhaps BillEvans but that would be a completely different comparison. Thistimeless album seems to have no beginning or end. You will getlistners lost in the complexities of this album if you hit therepeat button. The unlimited playablility is perhaps thestrongest attribute. Full house is the first choice but the Wesalbum you may play the most is this one. Just a suggestion andno more. Yes, Incredible Jazz guitar is great but I don't playthat one too often because of this one."
1,rubbish,"Eno twiddles his thumbs while Pachelbel gets butchered, every scrap of musical value lost as things degenerate into a meaningless, annoying mess. So clever but yet so pants. Why bother, you have artists like Thomas Koner out there who take texture and density of sound to a completely different level compared to this tripe and in terms of structure even a child could do better (by virtue of having some human input).Fire away Eno fans, I know you will, then go buy some music. If you can afford that special edition of Small Craft On A Milk Sea you can afford to take some risks in life."
2,Brian Eno,"I simply do not understand how Brian Eno can get credit for running others' music thorugh a fancy FX loop, claim that its ""ambient"" music and get crdit for it as if people had never lsitened to music in the back ground."
5,Eno's greatest masterpiece,"I have listened to this recording and I think its GREAT! Not only does it paralell what Eno was doing with (No pussyfooting) and Evening Star, but it improvs on the concept. Discreet Music is 30+ minutes of short tape loops that were generated by a synthesizer and some digital equipment. That is all, but I think that it is possibly Eno's most perfect work. Being an amateur tape looper myself, I can understand the sonics behind this recording. I think this is a good piece to play VERY QUIETLY at night. on the other hand, the Pachabel canon variations are NOT GOOD. They do not work well with the rest of the album. I do not play them often. But side one-Discreet Music-is the BEST tape loop piece I have yet heard."
5,Second only to the LP,"Excellent work of music. This was the first Eno album I had ever heard, if you discount his contributions to various other groups like U2. I inherited a collection of about 200 LPs, and this was among them. I put it on and went into dreamland. The best way to truly enjoy it is on LP with its amazing quality, but as that isn't very portable, or purchaseable anymore, the CD is the best thing. You'll never regret this one."
4,Eno creates atmosphere rather than entertainment on this one,"Eno's experimental attitude towards music of all and any kinds is distinctly muted on this album. Here he is trying to make ambient music as a background or counterpoint to other activities which can also be used as a focus for meditation or similar ""non-activities."" The whole album becomes a non-activity that serves very well as aural wallpaper but isn't likely to inspire or provoke anything in particular ... which is what its intention is in the first place."
3,"A ""got cha"" movie.","For a B- type movie this is a fairly decent one. It does have a story line. The acting is not too bad and it IS a bit spooky. The end did catch me unprepared! It reminds me a lot of Dark World with Michael Pare` which had a ending that totally caught me off guard. Of the two, I would rather watch Dark World but as I said. Alike.Foxy Loxy"
2,I don't think Stars can trust their friends,"I bought this album on iTunes because ""Set Yourself on Fire"" is one of my most favourite albums. Unfortunately many of their so called ""Friends"" mangle their songs badly, including on of my favorite bands The Dears. The First Five Times by the Russian Futurists just plain sucks. I really like the Junior Boys doing Sleep Tonight and""Set Yourself On Fire"" (Montag), ""Ageless Beauty"" (The Most Serene Republic), ""Reunion"" (Jason Collett), ""One More Night"" (Apostle of Hustle) .So there are a few good tracks but most of it is rubbish. I recommend checking out Stars version of Set Yourself on Fire before checking out this album. ""Do You Trust Your Friends"" doesn't even nearly do this album justice. Save your money and download the key songs only."
2,Beginning,"Most of the songs were the ones on the tape, but the one I wanted most was not there...can not find except MP3..Did not show list of songs on website. Other than this one problem the sound was good..."
4,Elgydium Whitening Toothpaste,"This is a good product. I tried it on a whim, never hearing of it before. I am pleased with its performance and would buy it again."
4,I see you,"While we have not been able to actually hang up this item yet, the product seems every sturdy. This will help considering we plan to hang it up outside once the weather breaks. Between the birds and squirrels having such a sturdy weather durable product will make the purchase even more worthwhile."
3,Ok,This is cute but the color is kind of orange and plastic looking. I would consider a different design in the future
3,MV,It did not come with necessary screws. The nose is too large and the antlers too small.lllllll lllllllll ll
5,Treerific,"Perfect size, real good color for my tree and easy to mount. After I ordered I was regretting I didn't get the more expensive one cause it was cool looking, but after this one arrived and I put it up I couldn't be happier. It looks really great when the shadows from my firepit reflect off his face way up in the tree."
4,this face is pretty cool.,Ordered this face and received it in 2 days. Extra fast shipping. The face is made of resin and attaches easily to the tree. I bought it for Father's Day. My husband already thinks I am odd. He laughed and laughed.
5,Out of stock? Out of mind Publisher!,"Barnes and Blew have assembled a landmark collection of powerful writing by a wide spectrum of western women. The poems, stories, and essays in this collection remain as timely and instructive and powerful as ever. If Penguin has let the book go out of stock--or worse, allows it to go out of print--then a pox on its house. Once upon a time, before bottom feeders made the bottom line preeminent, publishers kept books in print because they understood the value of continued availability to developing a readership. These days, it appears that the marketers of blue jeans and jelly beans are in charge--unbooked, unbookish, and--finally--bad for business.Find this book if you can. It will be one you cherish."
5,Profoundly Underrated Women's Lit.,"I had to buy a copy of this book for a lit. class while at the University of Nevada, Reno in Spring 1995. I didn't bother to read it through until that summer while working as a fledgling journalist in Owens Valley, California.I've read it three times since. This is, hands down, one of the best short story anthologies I've ever read. It's doubly tragic that it's out of print and it's probably been stereotyped as ""feminist"" and/or ""women's literature"" because really these stories belong to everybody.If you ever struggled to survive dirt poor in a Western town, these stories are for you. Leslie Ryan's ""The Other Side of Fire"" ought to be required reading in every high school from Montana to Arizona."
3,Long on Scent . . . Short on Lasting,"I absolutely adore this fragrance. I, too, like the pink bottle. I always get compliments from my boyfriend and stangers alike. The one flaw: It does not last; not at all. In fact, when I visit perfume shops and the subject of this particular frangrance comes up, the person behind the counter will always agree with me, that it smells wonderful but you have to constanty reapply it."
4,Love it...Almost,"A little heavy on the hyacinth, byt thats my own opinion. Everyone else seems to love it when I have it on."
3,Patio Door Lock,"This item did not come with all the hardward that is needed for installation. Only sent screws for wood floors, so might work great for that. I need screws that will go into the aluminum frame. I could go and buy some, but I don't think they are so expensive that they could not have been included for either/or type of floors/door. Maybe a note that this item is for ""wood"" floors."
5,Powerful documentary,"I always wondered why Polynesian culture is found in such diverse places as hawaii, Samoa, New Zealand... This film answered my curiosity. It is not fancy filming but factual with clear explanation of the technology of the craft made of fresh wood that survives the rough sea.Great recommendation from my friend Barre, a film maker."
3,Poor quality film,"I don't know what I expected, but I had always been curious about the KonTiki story. The film quality was very poor due to the age of the film and I suppose the ones who filmed it were not pros at photography either. Interesting other wise."
5,Kon-Tiki DVD,I had always wanted to know more about Easter Island and those monolithic statues especially after reading AKU-AKU--it would have been nice to see all those tunnels within the bowels of the island as described in this book. I've always wondered if early Americans could have populated Easter Island or that it was possible for Americans to sail to Polynesia or that Polynesians are indeed American. Thor Heyerdahl proved this theory.
4,Kon-Tiki video,"The Kon-Tiki raft expedition of 1947 was one of the greatest adventures ever filmed. I hadn't seen it in many years and was reminded of the odyssey when the death of its one remaining member occurred recently.The film that survived the trip was edited and released as a documentary film in 1951 in the wake of the success of the book, ""Kon-Tiki"" by Thor Heyerdahl. It was good enough to win an academy award.Read the book, then see the movie if you can get a copy."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I was surprised to find that this is a DVD-R. I believe this sort of information should be revealed somewhere in the product description. Also, most sources say KON TIKI runs 73 minutes; the main feature on this disc has a running time of less than an hour. There are additional features on the disc, but that is somewhat beside the point.There is an out-of-print Image entertainment DVD of this title available for about the same money. I'd recommend it, as I'm betting its a legitimate pressed (rather than burned) DVD."
1,Can't view the movie!,"I received a scratched DVD, and am unable to contact the company (moviemars) to return it. Amazon can't help because they didn't ""sell it"". I am disappointed - this is the second time I have tried to get this DVD. The first time it was ""lost"" in the mail with no refund. Now it's scratched. Don't order from this company!Also, I wish Amazon would take some responsibility for this kind of situation - at least to intercede somehow when materials are not delivered, lost, or damaged. Makes me not want to order through Amazon!"
5,Thor Heyerdahl crosses the Pacific in the Kon-Tiki raft,"In 1947 Norwegian biologist Thor Heyerdahl and five crew members embarked on a 4,300 mile expedition across the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia by raft. Ridiculed by the scientific establishment, Heyerdahl wanted to duplicate the legendary voyage of an ancient race of settlers led by the mythical hero Kon-Tiki. The expedition attracted worldwide attention as one of the most daring feats of its day. Heyerdahl's story was told first in his book and then in this 1950 Oscar-winning Documentary Feature directed by Olle Nordemar. The story of ""Kon-Tiki"" is half Lindberg crossing the Atlantic and half Schleimann discovering Troy, since it has inspired not only other perilous voyages but archeological investigation. This might be black-and-white photography, but ""Kon-Tinki"" is still an exciting documentary record of an epic journey."
3,Would be better if there was some extras.,"This DVD doesn't even have a menu. Soon as you put it in it just starts playing and when you do hit the menu button it just goes to the chapter listing. How cheap.The documentary itself about Thor Heyerdahl and his crew sailing a large raft 5,000 miles from South America to the Polynesian Islands is interesting but surprisingly tiresome - I felt like I was watching somebody's vacation videos. You would think actual footage of people sailing a handmade raft the equivalent of San Francisco to Iceland in open water would be very exciting, but Thor's narration is so flat he sucks the energy right out of the remarkable images on the screen.Worth watching for historical value."
2,No One Does It Like Waylon...,"These versions of classic Waylon songs are okay, but they just make me want to put in the original version done by Waylon himself. I appreciate the artists wanting to do a tribute to this awesome picker (and I am a big Robert Earl Keen fan), but they just don't do Waymore justice!"
4,A Nice Way To Remember Waylon,This Album Got A LOT Of Great Songs That WE All Know From Waylons CD`s
3,"Multi-use product, sort of works...","I bought this for it's fat-separating option, but also because it's larger than most other fat separators out there, and it has multiple uses. I'm not a big fan of uni-tasker kitchen items, so the fact that this also has a strainer, a lid, and can be used as a measuring cup was a huge selling point. However, it didn't do a very good job of separating the fat-- because the fat separator is an insert, it just wasn't as effective. I'm still happy I bought it, but if I ever need to separate fat again, I'll probably buy a dedicated fat separator."
1,This version sucks!,"Whatever you do, dont buy this. Go somewhere else and and pay the few extra bucks for the ""uncut"" version. Its worth it. Amazon sucks!"
2,What the...!,"Do not buy this version! Theres so much missing ite not even funny. Oh yea, on the ""real"" cover of the movie the girls around Snoop are naked."
2,Be Careful,I bought the one with the girls wearing bathing suits on the cover. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I was ticked off after watching this and I still am. This must be the edited version!
3,Recording Details,"Double CD with Music by Danish Composer Gunnar Berg (1909-1989): Essai acoustique, Aloys Kontarsky, piano, Aarhus Symphony Orchestra, Ole Schmidt, conductor. - pour piano et orchestre, Béatrice Berg, piano, Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra, Miltiades Caridis, conductor. Frise, Elisabeth Klein, piano, Members of the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra,Tamás Vetö, conductor. Uculang, Béatrice Berg, piano, Aarhus Symphony Orchestra, Kari Tikka, conductor.I don't know the recording. I rate it, because there is no other possibility."
5,PCO's first and greatest,"This might not be the best choice for newcomers to the Penguin Cafe, but this is ultimately their most satisfying album. ""Music from the Penguin Cafe"" shows off their soft melodic sides (Penguin Cafe Single, The sound of someone you love...) while at the same time demonstrating their more experimental and harsher sounding moods (In a Sydney Motel, Surface Tension). Highly recommended are the songs ""Penguin Cafe Single"", ""Zopf: In a Sydney Motel"", and the sorrowful ""The Sound of Someone You Love Who's Going Away and it Doesn't Matter""."
5,Outdoor Research haqs a winner.,"For paddling in the inclement weather, it is the best. Just what I needed and the wide brim, funnels the water away from my body. The built in ear flats are ideal, allowing me the freedom to be out in thje cold rain and feel comfortable. I found it very important to make sure that with the ear flats up, the hat has to fit perfectly for it to remain on my head during high winds. The adjustment mechanism allows for several weather conditions."
5,"Really warm, extremely effective!","Last night was a torrential downpour and I forgot my umbrella. What a lifesaver. Surprisingly , it kept its shape and no water entered the shell."
5,The most important drag document of the 20th century,"This film, which was unavailable in video for decades, used to be screened at places like the Paradise Garage and Jackie 60 so that new generations could see it. It documents a super-glamorous drag pageant in the sixties in New York City, and is peopled by legends from the underground drag/transgendered/transvestite world and from the world of arts and culture, like Warhol.The MC and hostess, Flawless Sabrina, is still very much a force in the night world of New York, and this film is a link to both her glorious past and that of a community that has gone on to mass acceptance through latter-day vehicles like Wigstock.I am thrilled that this film is available on video now -it is a gem and deserves to be seen, and re-seen."
4,Good,"Kept you wanting to know what happens next. Liked the characters, and the content of the story. Very exciting every page."
3,not that dirty little secrets,"This was a very good book but was not as dirty as i has expected. There was more suspense and not all sex, sex, sex which made for a good book."
4,loved it!,I truly enjoyed this book. I am an avid reader. It fit right in with the many other romances with a twist i enjoy. Other than a few editing errors it was perfect
4,Sizzling,Really grabs your attention from the start. I really enjoyed the read and hope to be able to continue the series. I loved the characters.
4,sexy and exciting,Great read....sexy and exciting. Marisela and Frankie made a great team. Would like to know moreabout how they got together as teenagers.
5,jray,"This a very good book. Has well developed characters and a well thought through story line. The story grabs you right away and maintans your interest to the end,and Marisela is a kick ass heroine who will keep you coming back for more. On my way to buy Julie Leto's next book in this series, ""Dirty Little Lies""!"
4,dirty little secrets,Excellent read!Characters and story line intriguing. Factual references to Tampa/Ybor culture acurate... I grew up there! Would definetly choose this author again!
3,Page-Turner!,"Dirty Little Secrets is a page turner from start to finish! The plot is compelling, the characters likable and interesting, the tension building page by page. Very well done!"
3,Entertaining story,"This was an entertaining story. I just purchased the 2nd in the series, since I need to see how things continue. The story was fast paced and not too many characters that you were confused."
4,Great read!,"Entertaining read! Liked te characters very much! Fast and sexy this is a story to pass the time. Beginning now book number two, dirty little lies."
3,Eh,"It was only okay. It doesn't normally take me more than a couple days to read a book, but this one took a while to get through. I don't know if it was the way it was written, or if I was looking for something different to read. It was good enough where I found myself finishing the book. But other than that, it wasn't too exciting."
3,Made myself finish,"It wasn't terrible. I can't really say why this book didn't keep my attention. It wasn't any one particular thing, but I just couldn't get into the story, wasn't attached to the characters, and just wanted to get it over with so I could move on."
3,2.5 to 3 stars,"I really wanted to love this book. I don't see enough stories involving strong Latina women, (I might be looking in the wrong place), so I was excited that I got this for free on kindle. The story started off a little shakey, but it got a little better. I liked Marisela and I liked Frankie. I liked the two of them as a couple, but there was something missing. There were some scenes that seemed a little forced. Some of the story seemed a little choppy, almost feeling pieced together at the last minute. I just can't quite put my finger on it. This story didn't hold my attention like I thought it would. I'm going to try to read the next in the series, because I got it free on kindle too."
3,Cute Book,Only gave it 3 stars because it was a little hard to keep interested at first. I understand Julie Leto has several more books in this sieries but I don't think I'm hooked enough to read them.
5,Dirty Little Secrets,"I just finished reading this book and it was awesome. It was a page turner, I couldn`t put it now. Now I wish that I had read it slower. It had everything you could want in a book, romance, suspense and and a lot of action. It was hot! Can not wait to read another book from this author. Great book!"
4,Sexy suspense,"I liked it. Interesting plot, action packed, kept your interest, well written, a fun read. I will definitely look for more of her books and look for any sequels to this one!"
5,acoustic kick!!,"This is a band that should be heard, from the opening banter to the close, these guys are on their way! Forget about the boring same ol' same ol' of Dave, can you say been there done that with Jack? I have even had the opportunity to see these guys live, if you think this album is all they have, you are GREATLY mistaken!!! A must buy...."
2,It was OK but not that thrilling!,"It is definitely not worth the money. It really gets boring after about 3 songs. I have tons of anime soundtracks and in my opinion the best are Neon Genesis Evangellion, and Gundam wing!!!!!"
3,Good Supplemental Reading,"Boyd's got an obvious bias, which precludes his analysis of some interesting facets of Paul's life and teaching. Keep that in mind while you're reading. The text isn't stellar, but it's adequate. The illustrations in the book are almost maddening - rather than giving descriptive details or telling where the images came from, the ""credit"" is, ""Provided by Robert T. Boyd."" That's, frankly, annoying. If you're going to include illustrations they should be relevant to the text, and the caption should give some indication as to what they are and why they are included. I am a visual person - I admit it - I LIKE pictures in my books. I'm a journalist, too, and it's irritating to see someone stick pictures in a book just to fill up the pages. Leave the pictures out and save a tree or two. Which is why the book gets three stars from me."
1,Uniden depth finder and customer support no good.,I wrote the company and asked how I could trouble shoot the in hull transducer and gage as mine is stuck at 2.3 - 2.6' after one season of good readings (which I was happy for at the time). I have tried the adjustment knob on the back checking power. Nothing. When contacting Uniden they responded quickly saying I would have to send it in for troubleshooting. Let me restate - it is an in hull transducer (epoxied to the hull of the boat as recommended in the instructions). So my rating is low for poor quality and poor customer service on a one season product at $100+.
1,Do not have this item!,They shipped the item wrong. I returned it to the shipper. This has been a couple of months. They still have not shipped the correct item. I have been in communicatuion with them. They keep telling me it will ship in a few weeks. I can't really rate an item I have never received. At this point I am just disappointed!
4,Just what the Dr ordered!,"If this book had included an electronic copy on CDROM, it would have been perfect! It is difficult to find an administration manual written for the network professional that covers the subjects in enough depth without making it impossible to grasp key concepts quickly. This book presents not only the operational knowlege needed but includes an inside front cover code listing table of contents making it easy to find those ""how to"" code examples we seldom use, but can never find when needed. The money and, more importantly, my time, spent on this book was well worth it."
3,Good but should have been better,"There is a lot of good information contained in this book just waiting to get out. Unfortunately, the poor chapter organisation and the abyssmal index makes finding the information you need (or trying to find it later) a frustrating experience. There's also a lot of padding with CGI and PHP scripts that didn't seem to serve any purpose unless you really wanted to learn how to program 'hello world'. Overall, it will teach you the gist of administrating an Apache Web Server, but I found it disappointing."
5,Great bath toy for kids,"My kid loves wholly mammoths, and this toy did not disappoint. Very solid construction, and because it is NOT hollow it's great as a bath toy (you don't have to worry about water getting into it and getting moldy). Also, it's very detailed (the surface is shaped to feel like lumps of hair, rather than just being flat). It really looks like a mammoth that you would see in a museum.One thing to note is that it is a bit heavy, so it may be too heavy for those under 3."
5,Keep Up the Great Work,"Chris, keep up the great work!!! LOL... u know i'm not lying.. anyhow, anyone should take some time and listen to Chris Canas' cds they are great... !!!"
3,Chillin out,"Bernard Wright is a great artists, The one song that stands out is ""Chillin Out"". I Grew up mixing this song in the 80's It's a must have for funk seekers"
2,Wouldn't Rush To Get This One,"This is a pretty typical effort for its time (late 70s/early 80s) but isn't spectacular or phenomenal in any way - even if he was 16 at the time. At steep import prices, this is just not a good value at all, IMO, unless you are a trainspotter and want to pick it up for the Luther Vandross appearances (producer Marcus Miller was the connection there). Otherwise, get this only if you ware bored and have cash to blow. Not an essential album."
4,Just Chillin' Out,"I was extremely happy to find this CD. I bought it as a gift for my brother because we are on a mission to replace our vinyl. Truly a great album, though not B. Wright's best work (in my humble opinion). ""Who Do You Love?"" still reigns supreme. If you are feeling nostalgic, this is definitely a great listen. Still searching for the 12"" with the various versions of ""Who Do You Love?"" Wright's genius is proved by the number of artists that have sampled his work."
4,tight Jams!,"Bernard Wright has some Slammin Jams here.I've always dug His Playin&Grooves.""Were Just the Band"" among other cuts here are steaming here.some cool Guests Here add there flavor here.this Cat has Been Overlooked far too Long.He knows how to Groove."
3,LOGO WARNING!!!!!,"This collection isn't really too good to begin with, but the ""GT"" logo throughout the program ruins it. There are only a couple of worthwhile clips in this. Goodtimes releases of this type usually have the logo and I cannot recommend any release which does. Most of these low budget collections are rip-offs with inferior quality. Most clips can be found elsewhere."
5,Outstanding,"I love these people. I don't care if Esther Hicks is channelling Abraham or not. Everything that is said makes perfect sense. It's exciting to watch and test out in my own life. Very inspirational. I thought the price $35.00 was a little stiff but Lordy the rest of her DVD's are $90.00. Now Abraham, let's get real - If you are trying to reach all those people who have not even heard of manifesting and are having a hard time coming up with extra $$, and you want to help the world, bring the price of your DVD's down to a more reasonable price so we can all ""get in on it"""
1,total BS...,"these people must be seriously crazy, nuts... none of the things they claim are proven scientifically... i hope they are just joking and making money off naive people... however, if they are serious about all their claims, then they must see a shrink ASAP...."
1,The Laws of Attraction,"We received the two CD's on on 8/15/2007 and they were both blank, so buyer beware that the product is not usable."
5,excellent movie,"First - I must say to anyone reading this that this movie should not be viewed by children because of the violent sexual nature of the film or anyone who may be troubled by this kind of a film because it is extremely violent and sexual in nature and probably not in a good way. But that being said - it is a brilliant story and a it is a movie that constantly has you thinking. It's a little slow moving at first but it picks up the pace as the movie progresses. I honestly wonder if the author was writing about a true story and thus never published the books while he was alive. This is obviously a very disturbing movie in many ways - but it's very well done, very well acted. But I get the impression that this is not just a work of fiction - where most likely the author was aware of this kind of activity but could never prove it."
3,Great Story..... twist and turns that you may have seen coming..but not completely,"I liked the actress who played Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) the viewer wants to know more about her, she is filled with darkness and pain. Can she be healed? How fascinating that her own darkness feeds her abilities to research and put things together. I want to watch more of these videos/movies!"
4,A good but violent thriller,"The Swedish version of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is a good thriller witha fascinating main character. Lisbeth is a type frequently seen in successfulthrillers. She lacks social skills and is a bit of a loner, but she is alsotechnically adept and capable of exacting horrible revenge on anyone who mistreatsher. The film is pretty tightly organized and edited. So, your attention doesn'thave a tendency to wander while watching it. Although there are some places inwhich I was startled by the graphic nature of the film, I still found it to be entertaining and worth watching."
4,The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"film was dark as described by Amazon, no surprises therereceived usual quick reliable shipping and deliverycan't say i enjoyed it; but glad I saw it, followed the bookvery closely."
4,Girl with Dragon Tattoo,Saw the new release of this film over Christmas holidays and wanted to compare it to the original release. Was very happy with the purchase and the movie.
4,Better than English remake,We saw this movie in the theater. We liked it then. We had read the book and could see how the movie stayed true to the book. We watched it on our TV and liked it even more. This version of the movie gives the viewers enough information to follow the plot without having read the book. The English version does not. We have already seen the next two movies in the theater and look forward to revisiting them on our tv.
4,GREAT,Read the book first and then watch in Swedish and then in English dubbing - just to get the whole intense experience.
3,Movie/Acting was good but story still disturbing,I read the book and it was disturbing...I don't like stories about abuse or in this case s-abuse. But this is a thriller/mystery. The movie was well acted and suspenseful. Only watch this if you can handle graphic scenes. I will never watch the movie Seven with Brad Pitt in it again. I had nightmares about that one. This one isn't quite that graphic. Does have subtitles so you can't do anything else in the background while watching this...unless you speak Swedish.
5,intrigue in norway,"A Scandanavian author is best interpreted by a Scandanavian film maker with Scandanavian actors/actresses being filmed in a Scandanavian locale. Sub titles are OK. watch what is happening on the screen. I have not seen the American version but as soon as I think about Daniel Craig I start thinking about him in all the roles he's played and that is a distraction. Watching the original Scandanavian film was a more ""pure"" experience since I had never seen either of the main players in anything before. Not a great movie but a good movie."
4,The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo,"I enjoyed this movie. At first, I noticed the dubbing, but after a few minutes, I forgot about it. I watched the other two movies, and I also watched the 2011 version starring Daniel Craig. I, highly, recommend this movie, if you like mystery.Even better, I am an Amazon Prime member, so I watched the Trilogy, at no cost!"
4,Quite worthy of all the hype,"Despite what some of my friends said about the Swedish version of this film, I decided to watch it and boy was it worth it. Its a little explicit at times, but the movie as a whole is well worth its long time. Its got wonderful twists and it really engages your inner Sherlock Holmes."
4,Excellent thriller,"This superb cinematic adaptation of the novel captures all of the intense drama and intrigue of the main story while justifiably (and mercifully) abridging the details of the rather mundane and yawn-inducing narrative frame that sets up the central plot. The film, however, is rather long (over two and a half hours), but it definitely rewards the time investment--the performances are excellent, the story is engrossing, and the plot graphically illustrates the original Swedish title of the film (""Men Who Hate Women""). I suspect that the length of the film, combined with the need to read subtitles (along with many Americans' cinematic chauvinism), explains why most Americans will not see this movie but will instead wait for the altogether unnecessary American remake (starring Daniel Craig). Their loss. ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is one of the best intelligent thrillers of the last few years."
4,Great but read book first,"I read all three of the books by Stieg Larsson's before I watched this video and I believe that made the movie that much more enjoyable. At a minimum I would suggest that you read the first boook (The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo) prior to watching the movie. It simply helps fill in a few things that were glanced over due to time constraints for a movie.The English dubbing is ok and does make the movie easier to watch for those of us who do not know Swedish; however, keep in mind that all of the written text in the movie (i.e. like news papers, reports and even the tattoo on a particular persons belly) is in Swedish and thus again it is good to know what it is by previously reading the book.Overall - the movie held good to the book with some foreshadowing to the second book - making it truly great."
4,Superb Film,"This film is superbly made. Even those who read the book (http://www.amazon.com/Girl-Dragon-Tattoo-Stieg-Larsson/dp/0307454541/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1281188269&sr=1-1) and know the story, will find the film gripping. The casting, particularly Lisbeth Salander, is amazing, exactly how I imagined the characters when I read the book. The slow - un-Hollywoodian - pace, allows the story to develop with surprising minimum omissions. Dark colors and settings help make the film true to its source. Highly recommended, but read the book first, better still, all three books. It does not spoil the film."
5,the girl with the dragon tatoo WOW,"This is a Swedish film with subtitles. It follows the book extremely well, and if you liked the book, you will really enjoy the film. The film lasts 2 plus hours and the time just sped by. If you have not read the book, I urge you to pick it up and if youlike it as well as I did, then you won't be able to resist getting the next one, THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE."
3,Wish it was the english version.,Watched three times to fully understand the full movie. Not for young to view. Would love to watch the movie in english.
3,Excellent movie!!,"I loved this movie, but I wish I could have it dubbed in English with Close Caption. It's an amazing history, the quality is great."
3,MOST INAPPROPRIATE TO OFFER WITHOUT AGE LIMITATION,"I found this movie in my child's wish list. His profile did not include an age. He is 15. Very strong sexual content to be offered so freely to a minor child.I watched the movie to monitor my child's wish list and purchases. Very alarming to see what was available ""FOR FREE"""
2,Bad quality dvd,I'm in love with the books and looked forward to seeing the dvd's as they had great reviews on NPR. I was so looking forward to seeing this movie. The quality was horrible. The dvd kept skipping and even reverted to English dubbing from the Swedish subtitles on its own. I don't know if this was because the dvd was produced in Mexico or what. I will have a difficult time buying a dvd from Amazon again.
3,The girl is too tall,After reading all three books I watched this DVD and was amazed at the nuances missed. It was still a realitively interesting and intertaining film and I would recomend it to those who are not looking for the same calibar of story that was written.
3,Never even tries to read the heights of it's source,"The film adaptation of Stieg Larsson's thrilling novel is underachieving. While I always expect for things to change from book to screen, the liberties taken with the material are there simply to help the film run less than 3 hours. The book is so detailed that I never expected it all to make it on the screen but without it, the story becomes episodic and dull. Which, is funny, since the film does keep up the pace and is never- visually- boring. Sure, Noomi Rapace is fantastic as Lisbeth Salander and you should see the film for her- but anyone hoping for a film that matches the intensity, detail and emotional depths of the book will be sorely disappointed. It's not a horrible film, but it just could have been so much better given the source material."
2,Like an X-rated LMN movie...,"If you like cinema: Scorsese, Coppola, Frankenheimer, Lumet, Jewison, Capra, Weir, Mamet... Do not watch this movie.Boring, dull plot, hack screenplay, cliched characterizations. Pretentious, overly intricate plot that is simply not interesting or clever. Vile, exploitative view of men and women, sort of a ""Saw"" for Swedes. I fast-forwarded through much of the final third. I simply couldn't bear to watch the glacial, boring plot unfold to it's utterly predictable and irrelevant (because I simply didn't care) conclusion. A ""C"" movie that has some sort of cachet because it's Swedish.I may never shop at IKEA again."
4,Refreshing Great Movie,I liked it a lot. It was a very good fast paced movie mystery movie. I don't think this as a classic or anything but something different.I was getting bored with worthless recycled same garbage Hollywood was putting through and this was a very good distraction.
4,Supper movie,"The movie, while well done, leaves out some of the story lines from the book. There is a fair amount of violence in the film, but of course the book was violent, as well."
5,A Great Movie,"This is a great movie! A foreign film that was put together very well, with great acting. I think most people would enjoy this movie."
4,Watching the Book,"I'm always amazed at the screenplay writers ability to take a very psychologically complex novel and turn it into a 'can't put it down' film. That was accomplished in this one.I was excited about Amazon Prime making these available through broadband on various clients. Someone had added what appeared to be the subtitle one on our Netflix list. Thought my wife would enjoy the dubbed rather than the subtitle version.So, went to bed planning to just check on our ability to get it with my Dell Streak pocket tablet. Once it started I could not wait watched the whole thing till almost two in the morning ! The mystery for me is: Can they take a very good book and turn it into a very cool film.....no question here.It won the honor of being the first movie I have viewed on a tablet. Very fun.Hope to have a marathon tomorrow!"
5,Best thriller I've seen in ages,"When I ordered this I didn't realize it was sub-titled movie something I'm not fond of, so I put off watching it for awhile, boy what a mistake. When I finally watched it I was digging it right from the beginning. The story grabs you right away and it is constantly turning and twisting for the whole movie, no predicting this story. The acting is excellent and great cinematography. The story is very dark and intense, so if that is your cup of tea you'll love it. Highly recommended."
4,Lisbeth needs a 22 episode treatment,"Stieg Larsson created many memorable characters in his trilogy - but Lisbeth Salander is THE STORY. In fact she is one of the great characters of fiction. The beautiful Noomi Rapace is perfect as the damaged brooding introverted misunderstood genius. My problem with the movie adaptation is that it cannot tell a brutal thriller, and also, in just over two, do justice to the intensity and complexity of Lisbeth. I enjoyed the movie. Loved the scenery and the Dolby Digital atmosphere. Definitely worth lots of stars. But I can't avoid saying that the depth of the characters was lacking. There was just too much assumed knowledge. It seems that the US is making its own version with Rooney Mara as Lisbeth. What I would love to see is HBO or Josh Whedon do a 22 episode series called Lisbeth Salander. I think that Stieg Larsson's richly drawn character would become a legend in her own series."
2,The girl with the dragon tattoo.,"The movie was very good to begin with. The problem arose when the second part of the movie was streaming. Unfortunately, it never happened. I don't know how the movie ended."
4,Better than the US Version,"Although the US version had better known actors (at least in this country!), and you had to follow this on through the sub-titles, I thought the Swedish production was the better movie. Despite following in subtitles (which you quickly get adjusted to), I thought this version was easier to follow and did a better job of developing the relationship between Lisbeth and Mikael. Both versions are good. This version is, for my money, a step up from the latter version. Noomi Rapace was excellent as Lisbeth!"
5,Full agreement,"I just saw the movie version of Girl with the Dragon Tattoo yesterday, and agree wholeheartedly with the others who consider this one of the best movie adaptations. The director did not stint in depicting the violence, very personal in nature, that takes place in the book. I also though that the casting was about as perfect as it could get. I look forward to owning a copy so I can have an opportunity to see it again. I hope that the American remake rumors I had heard are merely rumors, because you could not do a better job."
3,The books of course are better.,The movies pale by comparison to the books. I could not get my head away from all that was missing that tied the plot together. I wonder if someone who didn't read the books first would even understand what was going on.
2,Just read the book...,"After reading the book, I was looking forward to seeing it on film. Unfortunately, the movie was a poor adaptation...the characters were not as I had pictured (ex: Salander looked WAY too old)and not enough time was given to their development to understand their actions. The movie skipped past several chapters at a time and some of the plot was completely changed from that of the book. I would think that a movie made from the book would at least TRY and keep with the given details as much as possible. I don't understand why something as simple as the jacket in the picture of the murderer being sought after needed to be changed to a blue sweater?! Even the ending was hurried and left out some of the most intriguing parts of the story.Maybe if you hadn't read the book, I might say the movie was 'interesting' at best. But I won't be watching any sequels...I'll stick with the books, thank you."
1,Save your money,"Truly disappointed! The tale is lame, and somebody forgot to pay the light bill. The film is all dark (literally and figuratively) making some scenes hard to see. It would be of real interst to somebody needing an excuse to watch pornography,sodomy and fellatio."
3,The girl with the Dragon Tatoo,Rapace plays the part extremely well. Film could not precisely follow the book but this was the best that could be done. Those who have read the book will enjoy it.
5,An incredible and suspensful movie,"I generally do not like watching foreign language films if they are dubbed. Something gets lost in the dubbing, like the fact that one can be distracted by the fact that the words being heard are obviously not the ones being spoken. That's why I prefer the non-dubbed version of this movie.Never the less, I decided to watch the dubbed movie, and I can say that this is still one of the most suspenseful and most thrilling movie that I have ever seen. It explores the inner soul of its heroine, which makes it very clear why she must confront the mystery and evil before her.I will be very interested in seeing whether the great United States director, David Fincher, can do this book justice when he remakes a movie that is already a masterpiece. Regardless of whether he does so, the previews for the Hollywood version are riveting."
4,The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"The movie Director took liberties with the book story line, but kept the essential theme. Noomi Rapace does a great job as ""Lisbeth Salander"". I did not think Michael Nyqvist represented ""Michael Blomqvist"" as well. The movie attempts to address ""Lisbeth's"" conflicts, but falls short because it does not give you enough backround material. I am not certain that any director could properly incorporate all of Larsson's story, with it's many side plots. Overall, I do believe this is a powerfull film which was enjoyable to view."
2,DISTURBING,"someone had said this movie was good, so when i started browsing for something to watch, I didn't even read about it. I just clicked to watch. While this movie has great scenery, IT IS HORRIFYING. THIS MOVIE WILL BURN HORRIBLE IMAGES IN YOUR MIND. I really wish I had never watched it. These are things I did not need to see or hear. These are things that have no place in reality nor fiction. I can see how this would be pretty good as a book, but it needed to remain ON PAPER!! The storyline is meant for paper as well. The first part of the movie is not well tied into the end of the movie. It's obvious that it's a chunk of a book series. It's missing something as a single movie. and yeah DO NOT WATCH IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE TAINTED BY UNNECESSARY HORRIBLENESS. I think I need to watch Mary Poppins 1000 times to overwrite the blackness of this flick."
5,Maybe the best series I've ever seen.,"I started to watch this series of films out of sequence, but it didn't matter. What a great series of films. If you hold off due to the sub-titles, you're missing a wonderful experience. The direction, editing, and of course the acting are all superb. The story line will have you on the edge of your seat, and you never know what's coming next. If I could give it 10 stars I would."
5,Amazing storyline,What a great mystery thriller! I thought the subtitles were going to drive me nuts but after a couple minutes I got used to them. The suspense was endless and kept me drawn in til the very end.
3,Hard to Follow,"I loved the book, and thought the overlaying stories wove through one another beautifully. But the movie...very hard to keep track of what's going on. The dialogue is very quiet and difficult to understand. The accents also prove difficult. My poor husband had no idea what was going on. Not enough back ground info. Unless you read the book."
2,"Long on shock, short on story","I only made it 3/4 through, and then quit. The story hadn't drawn me in enough to balance the repulsion I had of brutal sex scenes, and an anti-hero that was more anti than hero."
4,good movie - great trilogy,"The first of 3 movies. Well done, it followed the book mostly. Made much more out of one scene than the book did, but that's creative license. No way the movie could replace the book in the details. You do get an understanding of how dusgusting the ""system"" is now matter where you live."
5,LOVE THIS!,Love the movie!!! Loved the price! And received it in record time!! Will definitely be purchasing the other two movies!! And enjoyed the added bonus of being able to watch the movie online the same day I ordered it!! Excellent!!!!
1,Beware of disturbing violence,"Although I read through the entire book and found the basic story interesting, I was disturbed by the detailed level in which some very brutal violence was described. What is even more appalling is that I recently found out that my friend's 14-year old just finished it after having selected the book from his school's summer reading list. I agree with ""Busy Mom of 2"" and felt that at least one other person needs to warn parents to read the book or see the movie before deciding if this is appropriate for your child. I am amazed that the DVD is sold out. The story isn't THAT compelling. The only things that make it stand out are the scenes of torture."
2,The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo: Extended Edition,"Film is in ENGLISH SUBTITLES, amazon didn't specify that is was, ruined my evening I didn't feel like reading dialog for 3 hours."
5,anti hero for the new generation,"this movie as u may know is based on a very graffic book. the story is great, but it also includes alot of rape scenes and violence against the main character lisbeth. if u can handle those scenes, this is the movie u should check out. the whole series is great. just make sure ur prepared for what ur about to see because it can get down right disturbing with the sexual violence. but this series will be a great classic. noomie rapace gave the performance of a lifetime. the strongest female lead i hever saw in film. she's also considered an anti hero for the things she does, and represents. she knows when to kick some arse. this is a movie character u wont forget."
3,"Good acting, sordid plot","Fair adaptation of the book. I had thought the book was too lurid and full of improbable instances and situations, but the film was worse, laying bare certain parts of the book leaving nothing to chance or imagination. However, I do understand that those parts were necessary to show how Liz is built and just what she is capable of in defending herself. The actors playing the two main characters, Michael and Liz, were excellent, particularly the actor playing Liz Salander. Her portrayal of brooding, bruised and fragile Liz was spot on."
4,A simple review...,"This was a pretty good film. It's not very action base as mostly is a psychological thriller. It reminded me a lot of ""8mm"" the way the story progressed. This movie is mostly a detective film in which a reporter (instead of a private investigator)is chosen to find out what happened to a missing girl. Also his services are requested by a wealthy gentleman instead of a woman like in ""8mm"". However, this isn't about ""snuff films"" it's about...well... quite a few things. This movie has so many plots going on within it I think you could actually make several different movies from it. Overall this is a good international film worth watching. Some films get rave reviews but aren't worth your time at all...this one actually is worth taking a look at.4 stars."
5,"One hundred words on a drama that's expertly crafted, thrilling, and smart","""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" combines several genres- an Agatha Christie style whodunit, a serial killer thriller, a foreign art house drama, an edgy Eurotrash movie, and an American style buddy adventure- into a fine, compelling film that assumes that audiences don't need endless action and a relentless pace to stay interested. While I had no problem with the subtitled, Swedish language version of the film I saw in the theater, the DVD offers both that version and a dubbed English version, which is actually fairly polished. Sometimes horrifying, sometimes very moving, always interesting, this film shouldn't be missed."
4,The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo,Enjoyed the movie. I liked the book a lot better but they did a good job giving the information. Noomi Repace did a good job portraying Lisabeth.
2,Brutality is not entertainment,"Let's see... after you get past the scenes of oral sex (forced), rape, torture, mutilation, casual sex, and sodomy (forced), there's a really good mystery story here... until you're treated to even more graphic pictures of even more victims. The body count is too high; the sexual violence is horrifying. The story itself was buried in the excessive violence, for my tastes. I can understand the reviews; it really is a riveting story. There are simply too many reasons to look away and not look back. Sorry."
5,I loved this movie !!!,"I started watching this film with the english subtitles and then I found the english dubbed version. The dubbing did not distract me from the story line at all and I much prefered it to the subtitled version of the film. In my opinion, this film was excellently done and I will be buying it for my video library, as well as the book. This movie is fast paced and keeps the watcher on his or her toes throughout the plot. This film is a keeper !!!"
5,Thriller with Subtitles,I had heard about this movie for awhile and I am glad I bought it. This is a great Thriller! the Investigation for the Long Missing Girl takes you through twists and turns and gives you the not so glorious history of modern Sweden. There are a couple of brutal scenes but Noomi Rapace is great throughout the movie.
3,My expectations were too high.,Interesting story and plot but lots of holes. Graphic rape scene. Very good acting. Just the review average seems to be too high.
3,Doesn't match the book,"Well this movie is OK, it's well done and all the rest of it. Still the book is much better than the movie. I would have liked a movie in the class of say ""Natural Born Killers"", I mean that would have matched the book. This movie is just craftsmanship, nothing more."
5,Gets and keeps your interest!,"Even though this movie has subtitles, it is really gripping - scenes are graphic but enhance the plot - not gratuitous."
5,Amazed and Enthralled,"I couldn't stop watching. I haven't seen a film like this in years and was so pleased I took a chance on it. It's been a long time since I loved and hated characters to the levels in a film, and the ride was beyond anything I've experienced in at least a decade. Buy it, watch it, and want more! I hope Hollywood doesn't screw up the remake as I'm sure they will."
1,If you've had any sort of violent trauma DO NOT SEE,"I really was very disappointed in this movie. Not only was there a very violent rape scene, but it went on so long, I had to wonder if someone (maybe even the author) had some sort of fetish. I had several friends with me and two of them left because they could not deal with those particular scenes (they started having violent flashbacks)... I understand that her experiences were important to her character but this was COMPLETELY unnecessary. They told me that if it hadn't been fetishized in the movie they would have stayed to see the rest (and only slightly better) middle-ending of the movie. I really do not recommend this movie to anyone. There really is no set plot and what I believed was supposed to be the main plot (the mystery --- based on reviews and descriptions of the movie) turned out to be a side plot."
1,THE GIRL EWITH THE DRAGON TATTOO,WHY DID I PAY OVER $10 FOR THIS ITEM WHEN IT SELLS FOR $5.67? I DON'T LIKE TO OVERPAY BY THAT MUCH. AT LEAST THE SINGLE DISC VERSION WHICH IS WHAT I RECEIVED SELLSS FOR THAT
1,Garbage - Should have left the original title....,"If you enjoy the torture and murder of women as entertainment, this is the movie for you. My family and I thought it was disgusting and overly graphic. The distributors should have kept the original book title - Men Who Hate Women - that is a far more appropriate title for this movie.I really wish I had not spent money on this DVD. I will be throwing it in the garbage."
2,LET TEDIUM REIGN,"Tedious. I got into this for about 30-40 minutes before I turned it off. The characters were bland, at best, and I found the pacing to be incredibly slow. WHEN WATCHED: 11/14/2010; MY GRADE: D minus."
5,Great,"Great, like the previous two movies it arrived in a timely fashion and was last of a sequel and again it was great viewing."
4,Good Show,I have to admit I haven't seen it. I ordered it for my husband and he really likes it. He has recommended it.
4,Great,"The last two movies actually have english dubbing, this one didn't but captioning was still very good. I recommend getting all three movies and watch them in order. I was blown away!"
3,Faithful to the material,Had previously seen the American version and was told the Swedish original was much better. While I enjoyed the faithfulness of the Swedish film to the source material I didn't find many differences in the films. I would say I enjoyed the Swedish film slightly more due to the way the relationship of the main characters was handled. The Swedish version also seemed more gritty a performance. Both were good though!
4,Crazy but good,"I wasn't sure what to expect but I ended up really liking this movie!There are some very graphic scenes that I had to fast forward through but it's the kind of story that makes you think ""wow, that chic is crazy but good"" lol"
5,Almost As Good As the Book,"This movie actual does the book justice. It does eliminate some of the minutiae, and it does not hurt the movie in any way. So far I have seen this movie three times, and cannot wait for the other movies in the Millenium Trilogy. Naomi Rapice IS Lisbeth Salander. She is electric in the role."
3,Good for readers,"I am thrilled GIRL is being released again in an American-produced movie because this one doesn't do the book any favor. YES, for all of us who read the book this version is great but that's because WE KNOW AND CAN FOLLOW THE STORY! The movement here is fast, the scene cuts are quick and unexpected, and I simply do not see how someone who has not read the book can follow this one. for thos of us who have, it's well done but I sure wish they'd put another 45 minutes into the film to flesh out some of the more critical scenes better."
4,Great Movie!,"I enjoyed the movie even though there was a lot of subtitles to read. It followed the story to a basic level, but they changed a lot of things up to shorten it. I'd give it five stars if they hadn't changed it so much."
2,Overlong and overwrought,"I hadn't read the book nor did I know about the plot prior to viewing this film.It's a fairly average thriller that relies on high level violence and sexually explicit scenes to try to push it over the top. The story is rather weak and at least 30-45 minutes too long. Despite the movie's length, there is very little character exploration, giving it a strangely hammy quality that makes supposedly serious scenes almost laughable. It just doesn't ring true and because of this, is not as suspenseful or menacing as it attempts to be. The anti-capitalist pro-socialist subtext also distracts from the story. In other words, the writer has an axe to grind in the guise of telling a story. Don't waste your time."
1,Subtitled!,"I did not realize this was subtitled, so I did not watch it. I have read the books and liked them very much. I'll ""Cloud"" it and look for the English version"
2,Definitely not a movie I will ever watch again....EVER,"I can understand why some viewers would find this movie 'captivating' or what not, but for me it was definitely NOT enjoyable. Thematically, it is extremely strong. The scenes are quite graphic. I finished the movie, but wished I had not. I do not recommend this movie for sexual victims as the movie does not spare any details."
4,Been wanting to see these.,"Very good story and well written. There were times where the movie drug along and took too long to develop a point. Overall, I liked it very much."
1,Horrible movie,"This is one of the most graphic sadistically violent movies I have ever seen, I was not able to watch it through. It goes right down there with Trainspotting and A Clockwork Orange."
4,captivating,"This is one of the most suspenseful, creative and entertaining movies I have seen. I put the four stars because the sexual content for me is unnecessary and over the top. The author and director must be incredibly talented and will look for more of their work.i have not seen the English version of this movie. but was told is well below this one. So if you dont mind reading lines throughout the movie then you should watch this and experience what most of the world experiences watching Hollywood movies."
4,"Spellbinding, the story pulls you in, forgetting about subtitles","I was hesitant to watch this because it wasn't the new English version, but less than 10 minutes in, I forgot about the subtitles and was totally involved with the story (watched it on my new Kindle Fire). It took a while to download so I could watch it on the airplane, but was worth the wait. The story was complex, and the filming and scenery were so grand. (Warning, it is a disturbing drama.) Lisbeth was an intriguing character, as was the male lead. I had not read the book. Now I don't even want to see the English version because it might spoil my current fascination."
1,Feminist Tripe,"I was offended by the perspective - men bad, women heroic victims - mostly because of its intensity level. I was able to sit to the end of the movie because I was trying to figure out what language they spoke while reading the English subtitles. This ought to play well in America after a Hollywood remake. If you're a normal guy you ought to skip it."
1,"Simplistic story, poorly done","This is an amateurish film at best. The screenplay is awful, but the basic story is pedestrian so I doubt the next version will be much better than this. And apparently most men in Sweden are secretly crazed rapists (at least according to this trilogy). Big let down here since I really wanted to see a decent movie from anywhere other than Hollywood."
1,Book? What Book?,"The book was great... the movie is passable but too bad it was not based on the book. It is very sad that the screenplay is a complete rewrite of the book. I have never been able to understand why producers of movies will buy the rights to a great book only rip the guts out of it... (Mayhaps, they just can't think of a good name for a movie so they buy one) they must really hate those who can make art. Anyone who gave this movie more than one star has not read the book... and if they say they have, they lie. Oh, and the lead male is fat. This movie is a maybe see the book is a must read."
1,Unfortunately there is no stars,I fell for the hype of this movie. Big mistake. I prefer family type movies & this one is absolutely not for families. Wish I had never rented this movie. Forget getting my money back. I just want what I did see out of my mind. Even my 21 yr old daughter refused to watch it.
1,This is a review of the movie not the book,"First of all, I give the book 5 stars. The movie, however, is a complete bastardization of the book, and proves that Hollywood isn't the only enterprise that can rip off other's ideas for a cheap and quick profit. First, the movie is missing approximately 50% of the book, making it a slideshow, not unlike the boring presentations of your relatives' visit to India, with images of ""me in front of the temple,"" etc., without the interesting details that make it worth while. The worst offense, however, is that the actor who portrays Lisbeth is about 15 years older than the actual character, who is described as appearing under legal age. This is an extremely important part of the story, in this book and the following two. There are several reasons for this, which you will find out if you read the books, but not if you rely on the movie interpretation."
1,If only,"I was really looking forward to watching this film, asI have read the book and enjoyed it. When the DVD arrived we settled ourselves down with glass of wine, and nibbles --only to find out that the DVD wasn't compatible with UK dvd players!! If only that had been made clear when I ordered it! so I now have one unplayed DVD of The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo - any offers?"
2,The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo-Two Thumbs Down,"You know how people say don't see a movie based off a book? It's true. I understand that they need to leave things out, but do they need to change things too? How hard is it to read the book and base the script off of what the characters say and do, instead of changing and rewriting? I found so many things wrong with this movie that I was angry at myself for even watching. On a positive note, I will say that the actors did a wonderful job. If I didn't read the book first, I would have thought that movie was great. I'm just hoping that the American version is as good as actor, Daniel Craig (Mikael Blomkivst), says."
3,Great Suspense But Story is Disconnected,"Hard to understand the connection of the two main characters and the believability of their relationship progression. Otherwise, the story was a tad drawn out but overall very good."
4,Great,"I really enjoyed this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't sure what to expect by the title, and this was the first time I had ever heard of the movie or the books. The movie is graphic, but that lent to the realism of it. It kept me glued the entire time. Now I want to know what happened in Lisbeth's life to make her the way she is. I'm looking foward to watching the next two movies."
3,Main Character worth watching,"I finished the book, then watched the movie. I felt the omission of Anita and Berger were not wise; more could have been emphasized on the fact the character Lisbeth is a genius. When Harriet shows up (not in the hospital, but at Henrik's home), she looks like a floozy barmaid. In the book, it was much better -- she was polished, well-dressed and looked like a smart woman who had been successful in Australia and an heiress ready to take over the family business.Movie OK for the amount of detail it had to cover, but if you read the book, not so true.Naomi R. is brilliant."
5,The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,The story plot was very creative and the casting perfect. I don't see how an American remake can improve on these actors.
2,Swedish Film,"This is the highest grossing Swedish film of all time. It's in the Swedish language with English subtitles. I would not recommend it. Worth a rental, though. Outside of a few very brief nude scenes, I found it rather pedestrian and wouldn't want to see it again."
1,Garbage,"This is third-rate formulaic trash with cheap plot lines and an insipid ending. Seriously, do NOT waste your time. This is nothing more than a boring version of a cheap TV drama."
1,A black tattoo on your psyche..........,"If you enjoy graphic rape scenes, sadistic torture, animal mutilation, evil Nazis (of course), father & son serial killers, and a host of other endlessly dark characters and situations, this is the movie for you. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is hopelessly bleak and unforgiving and assaulting - for over 2 1/2 hours. When it's finally over, you'll feel like a victim. I guess this is what passes for entertainment in some circles, but not in mine. If you're feeling overly happy and optimistic about your life and want to alter that, watch this film - I guarantee your mood will change. And not for the better."
1,a dark dark downer,"I did not read the books, so I am not comparing the movie to the book. I merely watched the movie for it's own merits...of which I find little.The acting in this film is executed superbly, so that I never felt outside of the characters or the film.The story, or 'mystery' as it is sometimes called, was so predictable to me that I found it hard to believe this aspect alone recieved any acclaim.The content of the film, or story, is dark and vicious. Ugly sexual appetites are the springboard for this descent. Nothing to laugh at or enjoy here, nothing to recommend this to anyone I know.I have no interest in viewing the next two movies that follow this one, because of this one. I wish I had not seen this movie. Life is too short."
1,review,I did not see anywhere that this movie would come without a case. I went and bought the movie the next day somewhere else and threw this copy away. Thank you for the waste of time.
1,Boring movie that needed better editing,"The first few minutes set the tone of a slow, boring film. Lots of conspicuous product placements (of American brands). The middle part is unbearable. The acting borders on amateurish for all the major players. Glad I got to watch it for free as part of the Prime membership."
2,Totally screwed up the book!!!,"I'm not going to talk about the plots here but I just want to let you know that if you read the book and are looking forward to this movie, you'll be disappointed. Many storyline in the book are deleted or altered. It's like watching a totally different movie! With that in mind, the movie itself is still below average. Maybe it's just the way Swedish people act/talk, but the actors are bad! They all look and act ""subdued"". I know from the book, Lizbeth is supposed to be ""emotionless"" but in the movie, all the characters are emotionless and look bored. I'm very disappointed with this movie.In summary, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD, RENT IT."
4,A little traumatized,"Yep when I got this DVD I put it on in the dark up big on the wall with my home theater, fairly late at night, my wife was definitely not going to stay up, but sat to watch a few minutes, then 'Oh dear it has subtitles, I don't like subtitles' She's actually quite different to me, I like subtitles because I can hear everything they say, and you stand a chance of picking up some foreign language skills, at least theoretically. I watched a lot of 'Inspector Rex' hoping to pick up German without any real effort and it didn't work, though I think I understand my dog better. Anyway my wife did not move until it was over. Now the question is do I lend the DVD to my motherinlaw who was reading the book? Somehow I don't think I will."
4,Very good,"After reading the series, I was interested to see how they transalted to the big screen. Both this and the American version were very good films, they both deviated from the books in different ways. It was interesting to compare those differences."
5,Nail-biting Suspense,I love the swedish version because it is much more authentic. Very suspenseful and action packed! One of the best movies I have seen! Acting was superb!
3,Girl With the Dragon Tatoo with Michael Nyqvist,I liked the English version better as I struggle with sub-titles. I am a very fast reader but it's so distracting to watch and read at the same time. I also liked the acting better in the English version.
3,Sub-titles,"I tried to watch the movie and it was subtitled so I stopped thinking I was looking at the wrong version. I talked about it to some friends and found it it's supposed to be that way, not sure of that but not my cup of tea if so."
2,The book is much better,"As usual, this movie does not stand up to the book upon which it is based. I fully realize that movies ""must"" be limited to a certain time frame (due to audience attention rates being so low), so the makers are obliged to pick and choose material from the book. However, this movie simply lacks all of the subtly and well-written prose that the book contains. I found the book to be much more graphic than the movie, so I am not sure what is so over-the-top there. I do not normally watch slasher flicks or anything with such graphic violence (it is rare that I am reading Larsson's book anyhow...I did not realize the amount of graphic violence/rape in it prior to starting; I was interested in what all of the fuss was about over it in popular culture). My issue with the movie is that it was just a poor adaptation and it did not match the book to my liking. I don't know if I'll see the next movie or read the next book, but this is what I had to say."
2,Not as impressed as 7 million people,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo did not impress me as it had many. I thought the tat was kick ass. The actor and actress did a bang up job but the story line bored me to tears. I was forced to watch it only because people told me it would get better. It didn't, they lied. I am glad everything was resolved at the end and understand why it ended like it did. Everything in the middle sucked. If you have nothing better to do on a sunday afternoon, you should watch it."
1,Can't even tell you if it's bad or not,"Simply put, the game doesn't even work on the Playstation 2. I have never ran into problems running Playstation 1 games on the Playstation 2. This is the first. I couldn't get past the ""start game"". I would get those jumbled graphics that you used to see at the start up of the old video games like Galaga and then I'd get nothing. I tried resetting the game 3 times to no avail.If you have a Playstation 2, don't bother wasting a penny on this game. I'm sorry I did."
1,Don't waste your money Dogg,It is not the Liquid City you want to see. You need to get the xther one. This is just some interviews and a couple of videos. Very Misleading.
4,"JUNK???? Aw, HELL NO! four and a half!!!","i can't believe someone is giving this only 1!!!!!!!!! I guess fusion purists are entitled to opine away but c'mon... I'm tempted to give it 5 just to butress the rating system but it ain't that good. If only, I could do four and a half... Still-IF YOU DIG ON CLASSIC FUNK/JAZZ/ROCK, THEN YOU WILL DIG ON THIS FAR TOO SLEPT ON CLASSIC! ALSO- (don't tell mom, but... the drums for the beastie boys' 'shake your rump' come from this bad mutha! need i say more??????This album rocks and swings and it ain't trying to be anything that it's not. If you want fusion- fine. But don't slag this just cuz it don't fit into your own lil rattlebag!"
1,Junk,I own 'Mind Transplant' which is a killer 70's fusion disc so I took a chance on this hoping it would be similar. It's not. Very boring 70's pop/r&b with not a good tune on the whole disc. I guess there's a reason some of these albums take a long time making it to disc.
4,Definetly worth it for the price.......,"What a neat little camera. I bought it only a month ago, so far so good. I turned it on and began taking pictures immediately. I hate reading instructions and this camera was very user friendly and very compact. I got it for my wife for Valentines day and she adores the color too. I guess the only negative thing I would have to say so far is that the memory card it came with was very small 16mb. I can not take videos for long or save many pics. But, that is a feature you can upgrade. I saw a 4GB on sale at Office Depot for $49.99. I am definetly going to upgrade it so I could take long videos and save hundreds of pics while on vacation. One other thing I notice is that when looking at an image through the LCD sceen, it looks fuzzy. But the picture comes out fine. Maybe I just don't know how to use all the features yet.Oh and finally, it should come with a carring case. Just my opinion.I really like it, good buy........"
4,"Great camera, great price!","A great point and shoot camera! Literally pick it up and begin to take beautiful pictures quickly and efficiently! It's small size lets you throw it in your pocket and head out the door, and it's quick processing ensures nobody gets bored. The SD40 even has advanced settings to fool around with such as manual ISO adjustment and color accent for more creative users. My girlfriend loved this gift!"
2,"Wow, really bad pics","Having owned way to many point and shoots, bought this one and waited a week for it to come.....the out door pics are nice,,,,very nice color but the Macros and indoor pictures really struggle to even look ok, my iPhone tahes much better pictures, it was between this and the SD1000, and now i know I made the wrong choice for a camera...Just ordered the sd1000 and moving away from this camera. Not worth the Hassle."
