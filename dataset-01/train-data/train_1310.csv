4,Gary Hoyt,"This is a nice well designed product with quality features although it needs a little tweeking to make it perfect.When the t/p roll gets small, it flies off the horizontal piece of metal that holds it in place ending up on the floor unless you either use your other hand or both hands to tear off the paper.It needs an additional .20 part. Just a fender washer, I painted mine black to fit on after the t/p.Now the t/p stays on the holder regardless of which hand I use.In addition, although not needed other than for looks, I added a round black plastic knob on the end of the metal portion that is curved up where the t/p rolls."
2,broken bear,"It was a cute bear on my wall. I followed instructions. Went to get TP off holder for use, and it fell & broke. After learning the metal plate came off the back of the bear."
2,rivers edge fishing reel,"It ws very plain did not have any finish at all on it, so had to drive 50 miles to get a stain to make it look decent."
2,Bulky,Big and bulky and cheaply made. A normal roll of toilet paper is hard to dispense. Very cute design though
2,Made in China with hot glue,"Some of the construction on this thing is done with screws, so is hot glue or wood glue...I wasn't impressed and embarrassed to give this as a gift.It is unique and my dad thought it was neat, though."
3,Beautiful but missing part,"I recieved the Spur Toilet paper holder and it is so beautiful. I can't wait to put it on the wall. However, it was shipped without the toilet paper holder rod. How disapointing. I would think that for this price all would be included. My husband now needs to go down and buy a rod and paint it so tht we can hang the toilet paper.Other than that I thought it was a good idea, with accessories to match (ring towel holder and rod towel holder) I sure hope that when I recieve the rest of my order all is included."
5,The Unoffical Review of the Unofficial Guide,"I love this book! I am an avid Disneyland goer, and I have every edition of this book from '98 to '02. It has awesome information about the rides, lodging, touring as adults, touring with kids. It also has info on Disney's CA Adventure *AND* Universal Studios!! I read it for entertainment, too!! HIGHLY recommended...especially for those planning their first trip to Disneyland...also great for the 100th trip!!"
5,Valuable,"When we took the kids to Disneyland in 1999, this book make a great trip so much better. If you travel to Disneyland, and back in time to 1999, make sure you pick up this book. Important hints at where to eat, when to get reservations and where to stand in line at different times of the day, optimized our trip."
4,Very Useful,Extremely helpful on deciding which rides to take kids on and how to make the most of your time. I am very excited to try their tested and true day plans for saving a lot of time in lines. Not very helpful with meal planning. Though it rates hotel rooms (in depth) it does not rate hotels (by quality or location). Overall a very useful book but so was Birnbaum's Official guide and the Econoguide was pretty good too.
4,"Good info on Disneyland, none on California","This book has a lot of information on Disneyland, but is lacking severely on information concerning California adventure."
2,Not a nice experience....yet!,"I've just got this car stereo, and my first impression is not too good. The installation was kind of easy, pretty similar to every other car stereo. However, after listening to my first CD-R (which played perfectly), I was unable to eject the disc. After that, I haven't even been able to play that CD. I'm hoping this is just an isolated problem, I'll be able to tell you if it is after I get my a replacement unit.Pros:* Good sound* Nice display colors* Plenty of memory space for your favorite stations* Displays current station + clock at the same time* Good signal reception* It's a Kenwood, and it's cheapCons:* Memory buttons are difficult to differentiate* CD Player will not play (I'll update this later)* Does not have a detachable face"
3,"Biased, but worthy","As he's done for the past 30 years, Mr Barone & company give us a decent snapshot of each district, member of Congress and Governor. His conservative bias shines through, but he still does a fairly good job. Congressional Quarterly's equivalent does a better job of describing each district and seems unbiased, yet the Almanacs of American Politics are a bit less dry.It's a good reference point for C-SPAN junkies or anyone else interested in the workings of our government."
5,Fantastic,This book really is one of the best accounting books I have ever used it uses real financial statements of the BOC group plc as case studies it has a wealth of accounting terms and ratios. I strongly recommend it for any one doing a MBA type course.
5,Outstanding book,"I have found this book easy to understand,informing and at a good price. I recommend it."
1,star is for Tristan,"Another yummy hero saddled with a totally unlikable heroine. This book has a fantastic cover (NK, my fav!!!) and a story that I thought really had promise, but unfortunately, it has one of the most unlikable heroines ever to grace a romance novel. Siobhan had a terrible childhood, I will grant you, but she was a witch. She wanted to kill Tristan right up till the end. What he ever wanted with her, I will never understand. I failed to see that she had any redeeming qualities.The romance, and I use the term loosely, between the two never took off. I failed to see why he would not just kill her and be done with it, especially after she threatened his little daughter.I like the vampire angle and Simon and Orlando had promise, but Siobhan killed this book for me. What a witch!!"
4,The Life of a Rodeo Star,"Chris Ledoux was a 1970 and early 80 rodeo star. If you have ever wondered what a bare back bronc rider goes through to win the National Finals Rodeo bareback bronc riding championship this book is a must. The author David Brown takes you through the early days when Chris was just a kid watching his childhood rodeo stars perform where he got the desire to be rodeo bronc rider himself. Chris started in Little Britches Rodeo, then High School and College and on to be a professional rodeo star where he endured low pay, bad rides, and severe injuries, all the way to the NFR where Chris finally wins the Gold Buckle in the bareback riding to fulfill his Gold Buckle Dreams. This is one of my favorite books."
5,Shadow Ranch,I have played Nancy Drew games ten thru twenty and this one is my favorite. I really did feel like I was on a ranch out west. Just like in real life you have to do chores and if done incorrectly you get tossed off the ranch but they always offer a second chance option. I got thrown off many times for picking vegetables before they were ripe enough. I also like that you have to learn about the different types of horses before you can go horse back riding. I had no trouble at all baking the cake. The hardest part for me was going thru the cave maze. It is just so easy to get turned around. It took me about two weeks of play to finish the game since I did not go to the web site for cheats and/or hints.
5,The best Nancy Drew game I've played so far.,"Both my Father and I really enjoy the Nancy Drew games and I've played nearly all of them. This game is probably the best so far. The stories and voice acting are always great in these games, the interface is simple to use, and there are a lot of nice touches put into these games which make them very enjoyable, even for a grown-up.This title is particularly enjoyable as it seems that everything involved in game play just came into place. Puzzles are well integrated into the story line and although not easy, are not impossible to figure out or accomplish. The story is engaging, and it's very exciting for we city slickers to get to ride a virtual horse and rope! I was particularly impressed with the ending puzzles, I thought they were extremely well done.If you've never played an Nancy Drew game, I would recommend this one to start so that you can see all the best they have to offer."
5,awesome game!!!!,"I GOT THIS GAME A YEAR AGO.I AM NOW FINISHED WITH THE GAME.I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS MY FAVORITE GAME.AS YOU KNOW YOU TRAVEL TO BESS'S AUNTS AND UNCLES RANCH.THERE YOU FIND OUT ABOUT A GLOWING HORSE THAT LEADS YOU TO THE MYSTERY. IN THIS MYSTERY YOU DO CHORES, TALK TO PEOPLE, RIDE A HORSE NAMED BOB, AND EXPLORE 5 LOCATIONS.I HAVE ONLY THREE GAMES THE SECRET OF THE OLD CLOCK,BLACKMOORE MANOR,AND OF COURSE SECRET OF SHADOW RANCH. THANKS FOR LISTENING TO MY REVIEW AND I HOPE IT HELPS!"
5,The Secret of Shadow Ranch,"This was definitely a great addition to the Nancy Drew computer games. They changed the inventory window and it takes a little time to get used to it. Yes, it is frustrating at first but by the end, I decided it was a great idea.In this mystery, Nancy goes to a ranch (I guess you probably figured that out from the title :) We do not get see Bess and George because their plane was delayed but we still get to call them and the Hardy boys to get hints.The suspects in this game are Shorty- the cook; Tex- the head wrangler; Dave- the cowboy; and Mary Yazzi- an antique seller.Nancy rides a horse in the game, which is neat. Some of the chores Nancy does at the Ranch are a little tedious and repetitive but they did seem to get easier as they go.In the end, I really liked this mystery and I am ready to start the next one that comes out."
2,my least favorite ND Mystery so far,"Let me start by stating that this is only the 3rd Nancy Drew Mystery I've played , however it is definitely the worst one of the three. I found this game to be completely tedious, frustrating and ultimately boring. I can't tell you how many times I just wanted to quit. When I played the other 2 I had so much fun and couldn't wait to get back to them whenever I had to stop playing, this one I just dreaded. I had a hard time figuring out what I was supposed to do next, when I wasn't stuck doing chores. The story was all over the place - I used a walkthrough to get thru it because I want to play all of titles. I hope the next one I play is back to being fun. At least I bought this one as part of a 4 pack so it only cost $14 for 4 ND titles."
4,"Nancy Drew,The Secret of Shadow Ranch",This is a excellent computer game I bought for my granddaughter.She plays it all the time. I will be buying others in the series.
4,AWESOME,"this game is really fun! it does get frustrating sometimes because you can't figure out what to do next but if you like mysteries and if you have time on your hands, this is one good game to play ... i like the western theme and how you can get more involved in the game instead of just clicking on something and having the game do it for you ... i really like the barrel racing and lassoing ... this is a really great game! i recommend it!"
3,50-50,"I think this is the best game of Nancy Drew. Bad parts, scary, too many dark places, mysterious people. Good parts, ride horses. The ghost horse isn`t that scary. It is pretty. The places I shall rate. Shadow Ranch-9, Mary`s Gifts-10, Dry Creek-1, Trail Stop-5, Cougar something-6. People- Aunt Bet is not ever seen along with her husband Uncle Ed, Bess and George are helpful SOMETIMES, the Hardy Boys are jokesters, Dave LOVES Nancy (how cute), Tex- Do not make him mad or he`ll throw you off the ranch- he is very silent and mysterious sounding-AND he loves Mary Yazzie!, Mary Yazzie-nice but holds secrets. There`s more but that is enough. Do not get the game if you don`t like mystery, scary places, combat, and suspense. PS nancy is really cheesy when she talks to the horses! ""You two aren`t to shabby either."""
3,not bad,I played the game at adult level I was bord with this titel and disapointed since enjoyed the final seen titel
1,Amazon Stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I got this new Shadow Ranch game and I was installing it and it comes up: Enter disc 0 to finish installation. I don't have two discs. I think Amazon didn't put the other disc in or my computer is acting weird!
3,Important Story Could be Written Better,"This is an important story because it illustrates how sealed adoption records cause disrespect for law and force people who need to make contact with their biological families to take desperate measures. The struggle for open records is a Civil Rights movement. I was disappointed by the quality of the writing, however. The book is only somewhat chronological and skips around a bit. Although it is a valuable memoir, a more cohesive writing of the events entailed would help. Also, those that are involved in this Civil Rights movement have to be prepared to made an example of as this is one of the only ways to get attention for the movement. When MLK was incarcerated he wrote the landmark ""Letter from a Birmingham Jail"". It would have helped the book and the movement in general were the tone of the book not one of paranoia and self-hagiography."
2,Didn't work for me,"This book is worth taking a look at if you are interested, but it sounded more like a long string of complaints about the state of mankind to me. Not that I didn't agree with most of what Rose had to say, and maybe that is the problem; I wasn't finding anything new. The pervasively negative tone didn't offer much in the way of constructive thought. Read some of the websites about Rose and see his writings there. If you like it buy the book."
4,Easy fast and healthy,I sought this book out because a friend had used it to make several very tasty and healthy mid-week meals. Although out of print I found an excellent quality barely used copy at an independent bookseller through Amazon. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I have already made several of the recipes and have been very pleased. Now I buy packages of chicken at Costco at great prices and have a wide variety easy healthy ways to prepare it.
3,Good book but more golf details than many will read,"I enjoyed reading this book by Nicola Furlong. Riley is a pro golfer at the resort owned by her brother-in-law. There's a threat to the upcoming women's tournament. Then Pitts, the brother-in-law, turns up dead. Is it an accident or murder? My biggest problem, though also a learning experience, was the enormous detail about golf and golf tournaments. Less patient readers would probably quit. Golfers might not want to read all that detail either.Overall, the book is worth reading. The family relationship between Riley and her sister is interesting. Just don't read it if golf isn't interesting to you at all."
3,"Too much golf, not enough mystery!","This book took an age to read. The promise of a mystery whodunnit was all too alluring initially. I was chomping at the bit to read this. So the main characters worked at a golf course, there's a LPGA tournament happening in the book, yep, I could deal with that! Bring it on!What I couldn't deal with was the ever present, and I mean EVER present golf theme running through this book. There was entirely too much golf, and not enough mystery.The characters were likeable, but a little predictable. The seemingly never ending struggle between Riley (the main character) and her sister Halliday was waved in front of our faces like a red flag in front of a bull.This book would have been half the size if the main focus wasn't on the golf game! Sell this book for what it is Nicola! A golfing book with a bit of a murder mystery!A couple of things I noticed:19% - '...don't mean (insert to) sound ungrateful...'97% - '...peeled around the cormer (corner)...'"
5,For Adrenal Fatigue with beef allergy,"I suffered near adrenal failure due to long-term stress, perimenopause, and thyroid problems 1 1/2 years ago. The combination knocked me down to the point where I could barely get out of bed. My excellent MD/natuorpath led me through the year-long path to recovery, and I believe this product was the key. Because I have a beef protein allergy, most adrenal gland extracts won't work for me. This one is pork based, so I could take it safely. My only complaint is that the capsule is made from beef product (gelatin), so I have to empty it and take it with applesauce. My only problem now is remembering to say NO so I don't overstress my body again."
4,Best way to get up to speed speakin' American,A highly recommended read for anyone new into the country. Sure to put an end to those drab lunches with your American colleagues at work as they blabber away about a certain Uncle Jesse or even worse some 'hickey' they had from their last night's 'getting laid'...
5,A Must Read For Any Cavs Fan,"In order to appreciate the history of the Cavs, this book is a must read. Having grown up following the Cavs since the 70's, this book is crammed full of interesting behind the scenes crazy happenings and highlights from the Miracle of Richfield and the old Cleveland Arena. Especially astonishing is the section of the fiasco ownership of Ted Stepian. Terrific book."
4,Enjoyable Show,"This DVD is quite entertaining, and the songs are catchy, although the ones in the original Wheels on the Bus are a little better, I think. Nonetheless, both my 2 year old and my 4 year old enjoy this video. It has a neat segment with a reptile farm, and my kids like snakes."
5,The Wheels on the Bus - Mango Helps the Moon Mouse,My grand daughter loves this DVD. She also has volume 1 and we are anxiously awaiting the third DVD that should be out in January. These are so educational and they teach values at the same time. It's definitely a 5 star product.
1,A Bad Acid Trip for Kids,"Wholeheartedly agree with M.J. Howell, just unbearable. The lip-synching is deal breaker as is the awful green screened backgrounds. Ms. Jackson's voice sounds the same as a mouse as it does as a spokesperson for the Tea Party, grating and intolerable, in my opinion. [...]"
5,Awesome!,"My just turned three year old cannot get enough of this series. We got the boxed set of three dvds when it was still available. He loves them all. I like them because they teach him things (about animals, healthy eating, and social skills) and they are not too fast paced. And they do not annoy me; some stuff (like Barney) I cannot handle over and over and over and over again but this one does not bother me. My 8 year old will even sit and watch it with him; she likes it too."
4,Stories which are beloved through time and space,"This collection of stories with commentaries, verses, word play and references is well worth owning.The Panchatantra is a word and world treasure in literature and the source for many fables which are recounted by Aesop, the author (authors?) of the 1001 Nights, some of the verses found in the fables of de la Fontaine,the Tantric animal stories and in many other recitations.This is a seminal work. This edition needs accompanying illustrations or extended drawings and, perhaps, rewriting so as to appeal to a reader of colloquial English."
4,Chinese is hard learn for me,Chinese is hard learn for me so purched this book to try to learn it and it has helped me.
2,"Good, not great, book","Good thoughts on the legal system vs ADR, not completely original, but thought provoking at the very least. Could just have read the intro and conclusion."
3,if you are considereing buying this book,"to be honest, unless you like to study a lot and memorize the book (perhaps will make you feel safer?), you probably shouldn't buy this book. too much information unless you want to get above a 750. basically the diagnostic tests are okay, not very accurate, but it helps you to learn. my advice is buy this book if you are a good biology student."
2,very out of date,This book took so long to come! It took 10 days before it even shipped! It was the wrong book too! WAY out of date and the wrong edition; it got me way behind for studying for the test :/
5,Very Good Test Prep,My son used this book to prapare for the Biology M SatII exam and received a very respectable 710 (out of 800) on the test.
1,This book is absolutely...horrible!,"This was the worst prep book I have ever seen in my life. I did not understand a thing and got more confused after readoing this book. Before reading the book, my score on practice AP exams were 4s and I wanted to improve myself to get a 5 with this book. Did not happen! Now I am getting low 2s on practice tests. Get this book if you want to fail!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great Product!,"I found the setup misleading. After a few attempts to get the AP into my favorites and fill in the necessary numbers it worked great. Oh yea remember to shut off your regular dialup! Not mentioned in the instructions. I wish the antenna was a little stronger, about 50 feet is the limit. I was able to set outside, look at the ocean, and access the net. Pretty cool!"
1,misrepresnted sizing,This product said it would fit a 4 to 6 year old but it would barely fit my 1 1/2 year old. I dont know any 4 year old this would fit let alone a 6 year old. in order to return there is a 25% restocking fee even though they completely misrepresented the product.
2,WAY TOO SMALL,"This is a very good quality costume, however the small size, said to fit a 4-6 year old would fit a 3 year old perfectly. Purchased for a 5 year old, it was calf length instead of ankle length. A great disappointment despite the good quality."
3,Sized small,"I got this for my daughter's Halloween costume this year, and although it is very cute and decently made, the sizes run small. The 4-6 fits more like a 4, and I don't see how it could fit a size 6 child at all. Luckily we just needed it for Halloween so it wasn't that big of a deal, but if you're buying it to add to a child's dress-up collection I would buy a size larger than what your child normally wears otherwise they're not going to fit into it."
3,Good Photos Of Martin Being Canonized !,"The biography of Martin De Porres in this book avoids or overlooks his deep compassion for animals, insects and all of God's plant and and animate species. Martin De Porres was a total pacifist who never killed any form of sentient life.However, this book must be purchased for its glorious photos and prose regarding St.Martin being canonized in 1962. Truly majestic ! Buy it if you love St. Martin De Porres !"
3,Just okay,"These are okay but not necessary. It has been proven that there is no actual benefit from using these. They are pretty boring for adults and it is not easy to interact with them while watching. My son liked to watch these but then again, he likes staring at the TV in general. I just let him watch Handy Manny now- he doesn't know what is going on but he likes the colors and the singing. I sing along and dance with the show and he gets a kick out of it. I didn't need these DVD's- I think they are a rip off."
5,You'll never tell a lawyer joke again!!,French is so captivating in his story telling approach that you'll wonder if he really did go to Harvard Law School.... Can lawyers be this affable?
3,Not What it Seems,"I rated this right away but after listening to it again I really like it. It deserves 5 stars but I can't seem to change that. You might think it has a latin sound with a name like Yo La Tengo, or maybe thats just me, but it's got that ""indy"" sound and if thats what you like you will like them."
3,subpar,"i think 3 stars is generous. i am pretty dissapointed with the album.. i thought that Summer Sun was an okay direction for them to go in, but this does not meet the bar they made for themselves with 'I Can Hear..' or 'And Then Nothing..' There are a few good tracks but the album is not consistent and it's way too long. The first track fails to impress and left an initial bad taste in my mouth. Hopefully the next one will be better."
4,Space rock plus,"This is my first Yo La Tengo album, their most recent, and I have to say I enjoyed it greatly. The first track is a great opener to an all-around fantastic album. This album is for a lot of people. It has a good portion of jam music, but also has a very musically grounded base to it, along with little pieces of other genres tossed in. I recommend this to people who just like fun music, but also original lyrics and musical style."
4,Velvet Mayfield,"If this is your first taste of Yo La Tengo be in for a surprise. You might think that this is just another Velvet Underground clone trying to make their own 'Sister Ray' in the opening track. But after those repetetive 11 minutes are over you find out there is more to it.Sweet soul vocals in the style of Curtis Mayfield, even including a great horn part. There's some jazz, some darker stuff and some noisy songs that reminded me of the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion and Sonic Youth.A lot of emotions are addressed on this album. Boredom and repetition, homesickness but also happyness.Good CD, not great, not their best, not the best album of 2007. But Good."
3,They are afraid of singing,"I like this record a lot, but I agree with others here who think the vocals are subdued. That's too bad--the vocal melodies are good, very catchy, but Ira and Georgia aren't loud enough. Can't really tell what they're singing. You can hear James just fine on ""Mr. Tough."" Ira already sounds like Lou Reed / Roger Waters at times, so he needs to really eat that microphone or dig down. You too, Georgia. We know you can sing. Get it on the tape next time!"
3,I don't understand the hype for this Record.,"I'll start by saying that ""Summer Sun"" is my favorite record by these guys. This is not like that. Everyone goes on and on about this and I dont get it. The way that they start this disc just rubs me the wrong way going for this noodling repetitive song that just stinks. This couldve easily been widdled down to an e.p. WAY TOO LONG. Too much filer. Sorry for the dis but its the truth. Ill pass on this 1."
2,A bit steep,"The price for what you get in this box set is far too high, as many William Castle fans will have many of these movies already and the only ""carrot"" for buying this set are three obscure titles ""The Old Dark House"", ""Zotz"" and ""13 Frightened Girls"".What annoys me more is that the omissions. The set does not include ""House on Haunted Hill""!!!?? And it would have sold a lot better with ""I Saw What You Did"". And it would have sold even better with the STILL awaited films ""The Night Walker"" and ""Macabre"". But what would really have clinched a sale for me would have been to see a set that included the extremely underrated ""Shanks"", which people don't even seem to care about, which makes my blood boil.I've been lucky enough to obtain all these rare films by now, and I have all the regular releases on nice DVD editions already, so a half-hearted ""collection"" like this doesn't impress me very much."
2,Glaring Omissions,"I was so excited-like most of Castle's fans-to find out that a boxed collection was coming. Thoughts of FINALLY owning ""Macabre,"" ""The Night Walker,"" and ""Let's Kill Uncle"" had my heart racing with excitment. Then I saw the titles. WTF!! How dare Sony betray fans this way!! Guess I'll continue to hunt the late night cable movie listings in hopes of seeing those 3 gems again. Thanks for nothing, SONY!!"
2,Too Much Friggin $$$$!!!!,"$72.00 !?!?!? IN THIS DAY AND AGE???!!!!! Criterion Collection would have released this set cheaper I think!Unless you don't have any of these on DVD yet (and I doubt there are many William Castle fans out there who don't), don't buy this on principle.PS: I only rate this as a 2 star release instead of a 1 on the basic principle that it is a William Castle collection, and these are good films. If the price had been around $40, it would have made a nice introductory set for someone new to Castle's films and I would have given it 4. If it had included the much desired, yet to be released films mentioned in several of the other reviews and been $72 it would have been 4 stars- unreleased films and in the $50-$60 range, it would have gotten 5 stars from me.Too bad."
1,SONY RIPOFF,"Finally, 1963's remake of ""The Old Dark House"" is getting a DVD release. What a shame it's bundled into a collection featuring a batch of William Castle movies that have already been released as single items... except for ""The Old Dark House""! Sorry, Sony. This Castle fan ISN'T going to pay $70 just to get hold of one movie. At least I have a copy of it originally telecast over Australian Pay TV several years ago... that will have to do.David"
5,The William Castle Collection:scream for your life!,"This is a collection I've been waiting for a long time! Three of my personal favorites (THE TINGLER, 13 GHOSTS, MR. SARDONICUS), a couple that are just plain fun to watch (HOMICIDAL, STRAIT-JACKET), and three I've never seen (13 FRIGHTENED GIRLS, THE OLD DARK HOUSE, ZOTZ!)...plus a couple of rare TV appearances by William Castle on his shows from the '70s, GHOST STORY and CIRCLE OF FEAR. If you're a William Castle fan at all, this is an essential for you!"
2,Mixed reaction,"Kind of happy to have some of these films. However, I will note that I would have rated this collection with four stars, had it had subtitles. The individual releases of the films did, but not this collection."
3,William Castle Lives!,"I grew up on William Castle's films. Kids my age were quite aware that the fun factor along with the scares made for a perfect Saturday afternoon. They didn't show them all in the town where I grew up, but I remember fondly ""House on Haunted Hill"", ""The Tingler"" and a few others. Big Problem - ""House"", which most consider the pick of the lot, is not included. Also ""Girls"" and ""Zotz"" are really not good at all. The choice could have been much better.Curtis Stotlar"
4,another fine Felicity Brooks book,My children (ages 2 and 3) enjoy this series. The three year old loves looking at the list of cats in the back of the book and trying to find them throughout the book. We also like finding the bluebird on each page.
4,Excellent Introduction to Director,"Compared to other books on the same subject, this one gives an in depth and simple to understand explanation of Director's capabilities. It also goes to great lengths to compare Director 7's features with Director 8's new, improved features. It reads like a good novel, it's actually hard to put down!"
4,works well,"I haven't taken this to Europe yet but tried it in the US. The first time I used it, it did not auto-shut off as advertised but subsequent times (3 times) it worked as expected. Fast to boil. Good for traveling. Capacity is small (2 6-oz cups)so don't expected to brew 2 regular cups (8 oz) of water."
5,Portable hot water heater,"This hot water heater is great for making coffee when you're traveling (combined with the Melitta Cone Coffee maker). It heats the water to boiling in about one minute. It's European, so make sure you have the voltage switch set correctly (it comes with an plug adaptor for US use). If you want to avoid the nasty hotel pots . . . this heater combined with the portable cone coffee maker is the trick."
3,Good stage production.. but..,"The casting of the protagonists didn't do justice to the opera. Turandot was overweight and so was Calaf, son of Timur.. Puccini intended to have a beutiful Turandot and a good looking Calaf. After Liu commits suicide, the conductor drops the baton and doesn't play one of th most beutiful arias. Pin, Pan and Pong were not convincing. The version with Placido Domingo was much better."
1,Too much,"A typical Zefirelli-like production of a great opera. I wonder why such an amazing opera is always so much overdone in terms of stage production. Those pretentious sceneries with a lot of ornaments, gold, giant figures and ""special effects"" are completely unnecessary. As in most productions of Turandot and Madame Butterfly in this one it seems to be a complete ignorance about eastern cultures. Puccini's music is also a mock of chinese music, but it is great and, by itself conveys all the magic and action of this opera. Last but no less, a cast of mediocre singers lead by tenor Franco Farina and soprano Luana DeVol (horrible by the way: too fat,too ugly and terrible singer) makes this production of the Teatro Liceu of Barcelona a very poor production in spite of the shovels of money invested in it."
3,"Could have been, should have been, but ...","It's an interesting premise: Beautiful woman seeks impotent man after she gets sick of the seemingly unsatiable lust of ""normal"" men. And it's also a real page turner, in the thrashy-interesting sort of way - I finished my copy in 2 days. But, the thing is, the writing is so flat. I'm wondering if that comes from translating what was probably German originally into English?Anyway it could have been a brilliant, acerbic satire on love and relationships but instead it was a rather forgettable read. I hated the ending by the way (I won't reveal a choice spoiler); it seemed a ridiculously utopian (lazy?) way to round off the originality that first fuelled the plot."
1,Stupid and horrible,"The jacket copy looked great: great idea... attractive woman sick of leering men, looking for something different. However, the book sucks. Awkward writing style, and completely childish relationships. She sounds about 20 years old, believing in soul mates after one date, inviting strangers up to her apartment, going to their house on a blind date, meeting a millionaire who gives her so much of his time and attention for no apparent reason, oh puhleeze. I got about 50 pages in and then gave up in disgust. This book was completely NOT believable. WHAT a disappointment. I've run and answered personal ads. I guess I'd better write my OWN book based on real life, not the fantasy of this author."
2,The book may deserve more stars,"The book may deserve more stars, but its hard to see the good of the book with such a HORRIBLE translation! I've been reading translated books from all over the place. Never have I been so aware of the fact that a book is translated as I have been while reading this. It does not stick! What a horrible way to ruin a book. Shaun, next time, take your time with the translation and think about what the author is saying!"
1,Ouch. One of the most painfully awful books...,"This is one of the most painfully awful books I've had the (dis)pleasure of reading. I speak German and there were many times, while reading this horribly translated book, that I could not even understand the English translation and I had to think about it in German just to understand the English. I didn't have a problem with the British English; I just had a problem with how terribly the translator did this book. It's like he looked up every word in the dictionary and wrote down the first meaning he saw, without making sure that was the *right* meaning. I have to admit that the plot isn't that great itself - it starts strong and then the author tries to add too many new twists and turns, completely eliminating the character development. All in all, I can't say that I recommend this book, but if you're going to read it, either find a better translation or read it in the original."
2,Interesting but Dissapointing,"I expected a great deal more from this book than i received, the translation was shoddy and the plot was too far fetched, particularly the rushed ending. Overall, i was looking for light fluff and i found it with none of the satisfaction associated with entertaining reads. THe one plus, i must say, is that i learned some interesting facts about impotence."
1,A real disappointment!,"The introduction is littered with an embarrassing assortment of ad hominem attacks against President Bush's administration. Unfortunately, the rest of the book doesn't get much better.The book, disappointingly, takes an unabashedly pro-Communist slant, as exemplified in Chapter XIV page 276:""... Much of the American diplomacy after Truman got into office was clumsily based on explicit or implicit threats by the Americans of using the A-bomb. We effectively rejected sharing of the bomb's secrets with our allies, except for limited cooperation with Britain. But Russia, also an ally in World War II, was frozen out - with the consequent festering of paranoia on the part of Stalin. Another lost opportunity for Truman, or whatever power elite was running the country.""The author's kidding, right? ... well, no, he's not.I did finish the book but, in hindsight, I should have put it down after reading the introduction."
4,Beautifully Written!,"Alberta Hawse has a vivid, delightful style, and her story of a young orphan who hopes Jesus will give him the life he wants is captivating...not just in the way it re-tells the events of the crucifiction day, but in revealing the change that happens to a heart that encounters the living God. Highly recommended."
1,Not Interesting Whatsoever,I didnt appreciate this book as much as I thought I would. The spiritual and hopeful thoughts in this story was a little too much for me. I do not recommend this book to anyone.
4,More Chris Rogers,"I read Rage Factor and the second book and enjoyed both immensely. Good fun reading. I'm looking forward to reading Chill Factor. However I was appalled that Chris Rogers' publisher passed on printing her latest Dixie Flannigan novel, _Slice of Life_. Ms. Rogers self published online. Haven't read it yet. Hope it won't dissappoint."
4,"Good, but dump the man, Dixie!","I enjoyed this well written book, but I hope that the character of Dixie's boyfriend is not allowed to turn Dixie into a driveling wimp. Many a good independant heroine has been ruined by a ""concerned"" man."
4,"cute, but predicatable","I thought the best part of this book was the characters. Someone wanting a 'hard to figure out thriller' will be disappointed. I gave it four stars not for the plot but, strictly because of the characters."
2,so so story----get it from the library.,"story is alternatedly violent and too formula. and never believable. feminists avenging angels dispense ""justice"" when the courts do not. fortunately it is a quick read. but had i not bought it---i never would have bothered to finish it."
5,A lovely ring,"The ring is elegant and sparkles beautifully. The prong and channel settings pass the pantyhose test (for the uninitiated, it is smooth enough that it snags nothing). The quality of mine is H/SI. The description above is lousy as it doesn't tell you that each princess cut stone is separated from the other by a baguette. The picture also makes it look like two of the princess cut stones in the center protrude but are, in fact, set in along with the others.The Fred Meyers store we went to (Littman's Jewelers in our state) had great staff and the ring is guaranteed for its lifetime. Any stone that falls out is replaced free of charge. They do, however, require that the ring be returned to them at least once or twice a year for checking. Fine by me. They also have a 90 day return policy."
3,Flimsy,My dearly beloved twisted this bangle out of shape just trying to get it off her wrist. Returned and got something else
5,Finally!,"Blaine Lee Pardoe has been my favorite Battletech author since I started reading the series several years ago, and I'd been waiting for a new book by him since Exodus Road.Roar of Pride comes in strong with all the force Pardoe fans should expect. This book packs a punch that's been missing from some of the more recent Battletech novels.The characters are great, especially the way Mechwarriors Bethany and Gregori constantly try to get to each other. If you like Battletech, you will not be disappointed."
4,Great book!!!,"Blain Lee Pardoe is a great author! The first battletech book i read was Blain Lee Pardoe's ""Impetus of war"" after i read that book i was hooked, and i became a battletech fan. Roar of Honor is a great book too! There are so many different characters in the book to keep the book interesting! I espicially like Blaine Lee's brief description of the Clan Ghost Bear's history after the Invasion, but he could go into little more about other clans(like how hell's horses got a place in inner sphere???) Dirk Radick's character is too hardcore, but i like how angela Bekker make him angry!!! This is a great book buy it! but i also recommand Blaine's other books like IMPETUS OF WAR!"
3,Decent until the End(ing),"Being brutally honest I can't rate this among the better of BTnovels. If I could I would give it 3 and a half stars... ...Anyway,the story is conventional. Outnumbered good guys fight bad guys and eventually pull through by their wits. It's been done so many times in BT novels it's getting seriously stale. At least Blaine did it better than many other authors. The book is a rather good read though and gives interesting insights into Ghost Bear life. At this point I might have given the novel 4 stars. But, but, there are some itsy bitsy mistakes only a fanatical Ghost Bear supporter could spot. And then there's the big one I had dreaded seeing...To recap: Unoriginal but fairly well written novel with a disappointing ending. END"
2,bad editing,"I am currently reading this book, but am dismayed at the horrible editing. A prime example is the inability of the editor to remember the various military ranks of the Mechwarriors, sometimes calling them Star Captain and other times Star Commander, along with many spelling errors-probably the worst editing I have ever seen"
5,Read This Book or Suffer a Severe Lack of Excitement,"Angela Bekker a Ristar from Clan Ghost Bear, is order by the Khan to form a trinary to defend the front line world of Toffin. With such inadequate defenses on such an important world, the Wolf Clan takes the opportunity and launches an assault. With an elite cluster of top notch assault `Mechs, the Angela and her green unit is out classed in technology and experience.This book was written with fantastic skill and detail. Only the most experienced writers such as Michael Stackpole and Carl Deuker. Every battle is described so well that I felt the temperature rise as the Wolves were surrounded by the horrific cane fire. The plot twists and turns and you never know what is going to happen next. If you're in need of some serious entertainment (for example you've beaten all your Xbox games) then this book is exactly what you want."
5,didn't come chilled,this needs to stay chilled at all times even when it is unopened. amazon did not ship this with anything included to keep it chilled which makes me wonder if it is kept cool in their storage. I'm guessing not. THis definitely makes me wonder if all the bacteria are alive and viable.
5,perfect,Product was delievered on time and contained all that was specified. It is working well in my homemade baby formula
3,"Volume 2 : Supplement to ""Making of King Kong""","While informative ""Spawn of Skull Island"" is ""not"" the definitive work we ""all"" hoped for. If you want that find a copy of ""Making of King Kong"". ""Spawn of Skull Island""'s format while hard cover lacks the full page illustrations and much of the impact of the earlier book. (Some of the prints are reproduced so badly they are impossible to discern most details (example p 184 the animated cave bear from Son of Kong). Others are simply to small and low resolution to be useful. As to the writing it is poorly organized and has the feel of an appendix to a larger volume many chapters simply lists of other films with short reviews."
2,More like Appendix than Revised Edition,"If you can track down a used copy of the original Making of King Kong book by Goldner and Turner, get that. This is more like a collection of appendices to that book than a replacement for it. It is scaled down, and missing a lot of the illustrations - especially the big double-page spreads of the production drawings of Larrinaga and Crabbe, which either don't appear at all, or are 1/6th the size with poor resolution. One for the Kong Completist perhaps."
4,An essential on the original King Kong,I've been hunting for this item in enlgand for weeks so its quite a joy to find it easily available on American Amazon. Its a great find with loads of work on the original King Kong that would interest even a passing reader. Big fan. Thumbs up holiday fun.
2,unable to contact this seller,"The condition of the book was as described; however, the edition of the book is a couple of years older than the newest one. With a book of maps, this could be important as political crises change borders over the years. When I attempted to contact the seller to see if he would exchange the book, the email bounced back repeatedly, so there was no way to contact him. I would probably never do business with this seller again."
3,Good Read,"I enjoy Wilkins' work, and I am pleased that more of her backlist is becoming available on Kindle.This is a Category Romance, meaning that the psychology tends toward thumbnail, and the Happily Ever After is guaranteed in less than two hundred pages. I didn't particularly care for the hero, but I was pleased that the motivations of the heroine were slightly more complex than expected. And I was pleasantly surprised that the children were more realistic and less precious than usual.This is a romantically sedate story; if you are desiring a sexfest, look elsewhere. But if you are in the mood for a family drama that runs a little different, give this a try."
1,Dissappointing for even an Elmo enthusiast,"This fuzzy-covered book lures you with Elmo's adorable round face on the cover, but has nothing to offer on the inside. I found nothing entertaining for my two-year old or my one-year old. Each page contains approximately one word. It's dumb."
4,explanations are almost better than the pictures,"I give this book only 4 stars simply because it's from 1979 and hasn't aged as well as we'd like: we're too spoiled with glossy, laser-sharp photos. However, the author sounds so knowledgeable about what the windows meant to the whole gothic experience that it's as interesting to read the text as it is to see the windows. I'm a little surprised that York Minster gets one little photo and most of England is given short shrift. My husband is from Carlisle, England and the cathedral there is the smallest but has the 2nd largest rose window...no mention. However, the discussion is good and all the interpretations sound spot on."
3,Teenware,Knock off of the new Dr. Who for an 8 to 12 year old audience. Fair performances and very formulaic. Just average TV.
3,Wonderful Series,"Bottom line, we've enjoyed watching it. For the true Dr Who aficionado, this series is a must have. Be warned that it is aimed specifically at a very young audience and The Doctor is mentioned once or twice and has only made one rare appearance in Series 3. This show IS NOT ABOUT The Doctor. That said it, is a fun addition to complete the spin off shows of Dr. Who. The quality of the writing in the first two series has not been as good as Dr. Who hence the actors have had less material to work with. The ""aliens"" and special effects have all been excellent, except for Mr Smith's campy entrances. Elisabeth Sladen does a good job of transitioning from the 2nd fiddle position of Companion to being the Lead of the show."
3,pretty good.,My kids watch this and this is their rating. They are huge Dr. Who fans. This makes a nice alternative when we run out of Dr. Who.
5,Beautiful blues to brighten summer toes.,"This is one of several toe rings purchased from the same maker, and they are quite spectacular. The material is nice and heavy with enough give to adjust. I have small toes, and this fit perfectly. The stones really sparkle, and the blue color, which is actually lighter than pictured, goes with most bright summer attire."
1,Petered Out,"This last installment left me totally iritated. After holding me spellbound for the first book, somewhat intrigued with books 2 and 3, a little too predictable with 4 and just mediocre with book 5, I expected at least some satisfying closure with the last book. NOT! The book didn't end so much as it just suddenly stopped-like the author realized he was running out of paper and had to rush it to a conclusion. It had a million hanging loose ends, a dumb climax, and [a poor] final scene. This could have been a great work in the tradition of Stephan King, if only the author spent more time developing the background stories of the original inmates or the character of Malcom Metcalf (i.e. the ""sources and nature of the evil"")..."
5,clasical ballet,Unique opportunity to view some big contemporary names with some not so big but still great - gala evening performance.
4,Cute puzzle for my kindergartner,"I purchased this puzzle for my five year old, but my older children enjoy it, too. The case it came in is kind of junky, but the puzzle is really nice. We also have a Melissa and Doug puzzle that is similar and I like this one better because the pictures stay on. The pictures are cute, too. I think it's a great simple toy. I plan on getting another one for when the children are at their grandmother's."
4,Ravensberger animal cube puzzle,"Okay, I've got lots of puzzles, including a number of cube puzzles. The pictures on this puzzle are great, they are clear and bright and not stickers that can peel off. However, these cubes are hollow plastic. This is a toy that can't be left on the floor. I watch this one. It is nice, the carrying case that the pieces come in is cute. My son likes that he can transport this like a little suit case. We have had it for almost a year and everything is intact. I hope to have it into the future. But it isn't wood .This is not for kids that are hard on their toys."
4,"Challenging, multi-use puzzle","This is a great hands-on, manipulative puzzle. I like that there are multiple sides to create several different puzzles. I was a bit ambitious and bought this for my 2-year old to grow into. Right now its far too challenging for her to put together so she mostly enjoys building towers with it and knocking it down. But I can see it will bring years of fun. And I really like that we'll be able to travel with it since its in a nice carrying case and has several puzzles in one."
1,So BOORING !!,"well, when it came I played the CD right away and.. well.. I was really disappointed!!! The instrumentation sounds fine, except its more like dull Chamber Music (more European Baroque than American!) and very, very booring- with nothing particularly ""Colonial American"" about it at all. There is one track that I like and could consider enjoyable. The rest of it is ok for background music in a funeral home...I am a Colonnial History re-enactor, and frankly, this album will not one I play (except if I want to throw a dull party!). I just cant understand the high ratings on this album..."
2,Hans Werner Henze,"Hans Werner Henze is not popular with music critics because he refused to join a 100-year-old avant-garde (I always thought of avant-garde as rebel youth, but now when a music critic says avan-garde he/she conjures in me the figure of an old, white-haired gentleman walking with a cane). And I like Henze for his independence. But l'Upupa is not one of his best operas,it is as crazy as The Love for Three Oranges without having that opera's irresistible music. If you wish to know Henze, I suggest Der Junge Lord or, even better, Boulevard Solitude, which, in my opinion, is a masterpiece by any standard."
2,and now for something completely different,"This fairy tale opera would be a great vehicle for Minnesota Opera, Chicago Opera Theater, Central City Opera and DVD. It would get lost at the Met, Chicago or San Francisco houses. It's a delicate story and the more intimate the setting, the more you're going to enjoy the performance. A cozy livng room is ideal for this performance on DVD. You will connect immediately with the sets, costumes, story and special effects. The music might be another matter. The orchestration is more intersting then most of the vocal parts. There isn't a melody or tune you can sink your ears into. I've watched it twice and I just wonder how many times in the future I'm going to take it down from the shelf and watch the entire thing again. That would be a hard call to make. I suppose it would help to understand German as I'm sure the subtitles don't tell the whole story. For me, the orchestra was the star of this performance."
4,"Excellent, good points about patient empowerment","Generally a good book, explains a lot about the author's history. Good points about patient empowerment. Very important points about use of e-mail in clinical settings. I'm a little more cynical about the use of direct computer-patient dialog for clinical information (One such system once told me that I was suffering from premenstral tension...it forgot to ask my sex.) Would like to have much greater focus on the future, however...incidents from the 1960's and 1970's are not all that relevant today."
3,I was hoping for the memoirs of Dr Slack,"Like many if not most of the readers of Cybermedicine, I am not without preconception of Dr Slack and his work in medical computing. He is, I think, a more influential figure in it than an unacquainted reader would gather from his humble self-description. I would have better enjoyed the book had it been more of a history, complete with copious name-dropping, and less a prescription for the future, as Dr Slack's strengths are, I think, more evident in his accomplishments than his speculations. Nonetheless, the principles laid forth in Cybermedicine are sound, proven, and reducible to ""the computer is the tool of the user, not vice-versa"". The reader should be cautioned not to consider them lightly just because many of them seem obvious or out-of-date. If anything, such guidance is more needed by the technology community now than it was 20 years ago."
5,Excellant Book that tells the true objective of computing,the book is the depiction of one dedicated doctor's experience and efforts with clinical computing. excellant in every way and brings sence to the ojective of computing and a master piece
1,Can't stand them,They never work correct. 2 out of 10 might but not for long.No matter what I do I turn around and the air is filling up the bag again.
2,"good, but _very_ little flavor","howdy y'all,this is really pretty good stuff. i had never had couscous before and was rather pleased at how easy it was to make and how well it goes with other foods.however, the ""garlic & basil"" is almost undetectable. you can smell it when you add the seasoning packet to the water, but once the final product is ready, the flavor is nearly nonexistent. i took the next two boxes and used the flavor packets from TWO of them to flavor ONE box of couscous. that worked pretty well.one might as well buy this without any flavoring and add your own.this next point is a nit. the box is sealed rather tightly. i was expecting the contents to be in a packet like the various flours they sell. not the case. so, when you open the box be VERY careful or you will spill some of the couscous. this is not a problem once i became aware of the situation. the first box, tho, was a bit of a mess. [*grin*]rated a TWO since the flavor is _far_ less than expected.take care,lee"
5,The best!,GREAT PRODUCT! Already have the struts and the ride is great! Will use again. Perfect fit. Are the best for classic cars.
4,You are NOT alone!,"As a homosexual man who has lived the gay lifestyle for over fifty years, this book was a breath of fresh air for me! To know that others suffered far worse torments then those I suffered at the hands of my father and brother made me feel better!"
3,when ladies meet,"When Ladies Meet has always been one of my most enjoyed movies. The service is receiving the dvd was excellent. The print is quite acceptable although not quite as as clear as one would have hoped for being only marginally better than that shown on TCM. However, this does not diminsh the enjoyment of seeing both Joan and Greer together. Ray Fogarty. Sydney. Australia."
4,Whale of a show,This was very interesting and we learned alot from it. There are many misconceptions about whales and other creatures.
1,Not too good,I have two of these mounted on the t-top of my boat. One for the FM antenna and one for the VHF. In both cases they need to have adjustments made regularly so the lever doesn't go past the end of the cam that snugs the antenna into position. You need to tighten the lock nut all the time. I hate these units but there aren't a lot of options.
1,So far it doesn't work,This product is a great idea but fails in execution. I've now tried several times to set it up but can't get the base unit to communicate with the satellite timers. I'll keep trying but it shouldn't be so hard.
1,Do not buy,I bought 2 of these kits. The first one worked but the rocker switches used to turn the lights on and off were really hard to press and get to work reliably. But I liked the way it worked so I bought another one (bad idea). The second kit was worse and even harder to turn on and off. Plus 2 of the receivers on the second kit didn't work at all. I threw both kits away and bought the Hunter kit.
4,Handy lighting control,"Unit worked as advertised, supplier was fast in shipping the product. would purchase from them again."
4,Side Mirrors,Installation not a problem. But needed to find instructions on WWW. Saved time and money by doing job myself. Need socket and Allen wrench for installation.
3,Don't Waste Your Money. There Are Better.,I was disappointed with the choice of quotes in this book. Conservatism has a rich history of profound and insightful one-liners. Only a few of them made it into this book.
5,GOOD JOB,"It was a very good purchase experience. Very good service, fast delivery, good feedback at a reasonable price. Thank you very much to Amazon and the supplier."
2,not what it says it is,"The first dissapointment coming from Seoan. Instead of getting chill music with sounds from Tibet, as promised, I got just a soft pop CD with a couple of chill songs. I regret buying it."
2,What is the link to Tibet ?,"This album is a perfect example of how to advertise a product with a gimmick that as nothing to do with the music.A classic amalgam of ""soft music"" with no real personality, ""Chill in Tibet"" as absolutely no link of any sort to tibetan music. If you want real ""chill"" of tibetan inspiration, try Dadawa or Yungchen Lhamo."
3,It's ok but...,"If you live anywhere warm bewarned, the adhesive holding down the velcro will melt. Once that happens the tension from the cover will pull on it and slide the velcro strip up the rails. Granted Truxport's warranty service was great and they sent out replacement side rails right away. Unfortunately within 1 week of putting them on it was starting to happen again already. This was when the temp was in the high 80's / low 90's. If you live somewhere warm, do yourself a favor and get the lo-pro or another one like it that puts the velcro strip in a channel."
5,Nice tonneau - Nissan Frontier,I had never installed a tonneau on my own... this baby went on in about 45 minutes. The rail system and plastic edge covers on the bed posed a few issues... but if you take your time you can get it sealed up nicely. I don't think you can get a nicer cover for the price. Have a friend over and open a few beers - it may go easier than by yourself.
5,Finally!!!,"Finally Danielle Steel has written a book that doesn't sound just like all of her others. Sure....same bit of storyline..but much better developed characters and a refreshing twist. Pip is a very sweet 11 yr-old girl who wins the heart of painter Matt. Pip's mother Ophelie was a disturbed mother who had suffered a loss but finds herself again after spending time with Matt. Add Mousse, the dog, and a few other additions and you have the perfect story. The ending was a bit far-fetched but overall, this book is a winner!"
2,Time to Fire the Editor!,"Okay, I give up! Who edited this book? Is Danielle Steel so sacrosanct that her editors are not allowed to edit?I agree with those who have written that this book was an improvement over the last few. Sure, the main character is the same, weak, indecisive, codependent woman but at least this one has a little gumption and actually stands up for herself. I am beginning to think that these characters have to be a reflection of Ms. Steel's own personality. Why else would she continue to create these weak women?Danielle Steel knows the pain of losing a child and offers some good suggestions for dealing with that pain. But as many steps forward as Opehlie takes, she seems to take an equal number of steps back. It is so frustrating. At least she reacted correctly when faced with the ""ultimate betrayal.""With some heavy editing, this book might have been a three for me. As it is, with all the run-on and incomplete sentences and constant repeating of phrases, I can only rate it a two."
2,"Blah, Blah, Blah","Danielle Steel has done it once again. Written a book that must have taken her all of one day. I was really disappointed after Summer in St. Tropez, but thought after a break from her books I'd try again. Sorry I wasted my time. This book is SO repetitive, same phrases are not only repeated chapter after chapter but in the same paragraph. The story line seems to drag on forever. If Steel's goal is to ""dumb"" her books down for the masses then she has succeeded. This book is written at about an 11-year-old's level. Don't waste your time."
1,One of the two worst books I have ever read,"This is easily one of the two worst books I have ever read in my life. It's an insult to writing and storytelling. The story itself is thin and lame, the characters have no depth and it is clear that no one edited the book. Danielle Steel's prose is filled with unnecessary commas, paragraphs with sentences that contradict one another and trite sayings and descriptions. My advice is to not waste your time reading this horrible book. Doing anything else, including staring into space, would be a better use of one's time."
2,Repetitive,"I've read DS before and I know that basically every book is the same. A woman who has lost someone, scared to start over, meets someone new, resists falling in love, but eventually does, etc., etc., etc. I get that, I'm fine with that, but I am reading Safe Harbour and it get extremely irritating to read the run on sentences and the same sentences being used over and over again throughout the entire book................Please be more careful in the editing process."
5,A bit of her old magic,"I am so pleased that Danielle Steel seems to have found a bit of her old magic!This is really one of the best Steel books I've read in a long time. The characters are great- and so loveable! The story is a worthy one about moving past tragedy and finding the courage to live again. A predicable love story for the most part yes, but isn't that what makes her books so good? A moral, a love story and a happy ending- what more can you ask for?"
5,Outstanding,I have used the rotary hammer for the past six months in my demolition business. If you have need of a good concrete drill it does not get any better than this.
2,Close....but yet so frustrating,"I agree with a number of other reviewers, skip this book. It is more frustrating than it's worth. Shame too, cause it starts out strong and then just fades away.Code Examples are REDUNDANT.Code Examples are INCOMPLETE in the book. (Even the ""Complete"" examples. Had to download the source code and go line by line to figure out what was ""missing"". VERY FRUSTRATING.Book skips arround quite a bit and is confusing at times. The Summary Case (3 tier architecture) which I was looking forward to was pretty much......um USELESS.Oh well, I didn't listen to the others, maybe you will listen to me. Take a pen, paper and write down the 3 useful pages in this book and save your money."
3,Not enough instruction on sample code,"I downloaded all the files from the website, and like a frustrated person before me, am stuck in chapter4 trying to figure out what pieces I am missing. I need more instruction on how I should have done the install/setup. File names and directories must match with the sample code. The pace of the book is good and tries to show very useful examples. I am sure I will need them, but would like to see how all the code fits together. Am I really supposed to believe there is a path called ""http://mark/xmlcode/demo.asp"" on my machine? Snipets are not enough. Show the whole code."
2,Barely enough for beginner,"If not because this book is one of the very few book currently in market, that talk about application of XML with ASP and VB, I would only give 1 star.Too less information, and explanation. Among the tiny 300 pages, much are wasted with repeating and repeating code example. None of the topics are covered enough - XML, DTD, XSL, XML with VB and ASP. I learn the fundamenatal of XML from other book - XML IE5 Programmer reference.Well, it did give me a quick and very brief guide to XML with ASP, make it easy for me to go for a more professional book, to become a productive XML programmer."
2,Save Your Money!,"This book is thin and the samples are very basic. All code examples are repeated at least twice in a effort to take up space. The chapter on XSL offers a elementry introduction, and then simply list the available commands. What a waste!The documentatin at msdn.microsoft.com/xml is much better."
1,Out of Date,"It is not often I pass a hard judgement on something. I read some excerpts on the web and bought this book in hopes it was very authoritive. Most of the code examples did not work, even after I downloaded the errata. I had to have one window open on the W3C site in order to track the errors and to get some example to work. When the author went the VB examples, there was no lead in. I recommend the authors' website, but not this book."
2,"Good for browsing, terrible for detailed reading!",I found the book to be very interesting when I was browsing it in the bookstore. After I bought it and started reading it I found it to be full of typos. Most code examples don't work and the source code is listed twice for no apparent good reason If you thought chapter 4 was bad wait until you get to Chapter 6). The diagrams normally do not correspond to the subject. It seems like the book underwent a couple of revisions and the diagrams/figures did not get updated. The flow of the info was good and the authors did a good job of explaining the new concepts. But if you are a type of the person (as I am) who learns by example you will find this book (the examples) very hard to follow. I came to this site in the hopes of finding the errata and corrections to the book but ...
2,"Good content, but long winded and sloppy presentation","Good for the introduction and general knowledge on XML. However, remember there are many other much better books. This book is littered with errors. If you are serious at looking code to understand, this book is NOT for you. I do not think anybody read this book for correction. How about cut and paste many times without any regards to where or how many times you are pasting or without any correction! To me, such publishers and authors should be held responsible for such poor books advertised as excellent source!"
3,Good book but lots of typos.,"Overall it's a decent book that explains how to use VB and ASP to create/manipulate XML. There's a brief coverage of XML in ch. 2, which may or may not be enough for some readers. The coverage of using VB and ASP to do XML programming is fine. However, the main drawback of this book is the number of errors that it contains, such as DTD. According to the book, DTD is an abbreviation of Document Type Declaration, which is incorrect. It should be Document Type Definition. Moreover the book has some figures that do not help explaining what the concept is."
1,Don't waste money on this book,There are other good books on XML - especially from Wrox Press. Don't waste money on this sloppy book.
4,Excellent quick-start,"This book provides an excellent quick-start on XML and VB. The examples are practical, and much better than the MS online documentation. When I was just ramping up on XML, this would have been a HUGE head-start.For developers already very familiar with XML, this book will be mostly review, and I suggest you look elsewhere. XML is, after all, too broad a topic to be covered by any one book.Fine work, Mark."
1,This is a waste of money,"This set is an Ultimate waste of money for the poker fan. The video is not very good. The commentary is the worse I have ever heard. The commentator sounds like he is reading from a script. even when they have people such as Daniel Negreanu as commentator, he is stiff..like they said ""don't be yourself act like a robot"". there is NO HAND ANALYSIS and it is just lousy. They rush through each table like it is a race. You start with 7 at the final table and you would like to see it play out but they show you some top hands and soon, BAM, your heads up and the episode is done. Stick to the WPT or WSOP sets. You can buy this one from me cheap, it will be up on ebay in a day or two."
3,Final Motown Effort,"Moving Violation incorporates alot of strings into the dance mix and it produces a bigger sound. Their remake of The Supremes' ""Forever Came Today"" is an over the top opus. The title track is a funky number while the closing two songs ""Call Of The Wild"" and ""Time Explosion"" are explosive. Moving Violation was the last album the band ever recorded for Motown and the last until 1984's Victory that Jermaine sang with the band."
4,Absolutely overlooked!,"This is a really good album that no one seems to have bought. It's really a shame because you can see that by this time they were growing up mucially and in general. ""Forever Came Today"" is just a great song with wonderful orchestration. ""Moving Violation & Body Language"" were also released I believe, but I thought all the other songs were better than those two.""(You Were Made) Especially for Me"" is one of my favorites, and ""Honey Love"" used to always make me dance. ""Breezy"" is sweet and catchy, Jermaine sings lead but I even liked the last two songs. I think everyone should give it a listen. It's very very good. There is really no filler here!"
3,Moving violation,"The Jackson 5 were running out steam at Motown by the time this came out. However, there are some nice cuts on this album. ""Body Language"", ""Forever Came Today"" are just a couple."
5,"Best Jackson 5 Album, in my opinion","This album is funky and full of harmony. You can hear Michael maturing on this record. The duets between Michael and Jermaine are priceless. On songs like Time Explosion where everyone sings, Michael is the standout. An overlooked gem!"
2,Topic of interest and writer famous,I purchased this in order to read some of Willa Cather's early journalistic efforts and at the same time learn more about the founder of Christian Science from a person who was contemporary with her. It was an eye-opener with several gems of the English language.
1,Inaccurate information,More recent scolarship has shown this biography to be a polemic not a biography. See more scholarly work by Gillian Gill especially her comments on page 563 about Milmine's work.
5,funny books review,The Survival guide to corparate america is really funny.Me and my friend were cracking up like maniacs over it.Particulary the bosses from hell chapter was exceptional.When I get older I will reread it and actually use the advice.That is pretty much it for the great book.
1,Really not a good book at all,"this really isn't very good at all. it's really simplistic, observations that have been very poorly written.save your money."
5,"Excellent ""Real World"" Prep Tool","This guide captures, in great detail, everything that goes on in a corporate office. This is a must read for college seniors or anyone without office experience. It will save years of growing pains. I believe this book is a perfect graduation gift. Funny too!"
5,A MUST FOR ANYONE GRADUATING INTO THE &#65533;REAL WORLD.&#65533;,"Recent college graduates heading into the real world ... this book is a must! The College Senior's Survival Guide to Corporate America will be your best friend, something that knows what you're going through. I graduated two years ago from college and the Survival Guide has helped me many times, I keep referring back to it. In fact, right now I'm working toward next year's promotion thanks to Mr. Pollack's tips. I'll make back the price of the book many times over."
5,Such a funny book,"We have had this book for years and I just purchased it for my daughter's Kindergarten classroom, it is such a fun book, I love the illustrations and it is one that I can read again and again and still enjoy it."
1,priced too high,You can buy brand new 20 feet climbing sticks from sportsman guide for only 35.00 and thats their regular price all the time. All theses others listed here is not worth the money. Shop sportsman Guide!
1,shallow and insipid,"I stopped reading this book about 100 pages in, and that's unusual for me. I rarely give up on a book...it seems wasteful somehow. But I am learning to...since there are so many fabulous books to read, why waste my time with something bad? The main character is a spoiled whiny brat, but of course she's gorgeous so she has her choice of any man on the planet and indulges in endless slutty behavior. And there aren't even any good sex scenes, if that's your thing. The book is supposed to show her inner beauty and how she finds love and peace. Don't waste your time. She has no inner beauty."
3,What did the ending mean?,"I liked the author's other book, The French Gardener, so I thought I would try this one. I was so tired how beautiful Valentina and Alba were (did they every do anything constructive?) I read and reread the ending and couldn't figure out what the author wanted us to believe. I admit it kept my interest but the ending left me flat."
2,Less than I expected,"Considering the subject matter, I hoped for more. This book was hugely overwritten on a slightly rancid theme. Not worth the candle."
2,One daily dose = FOUR caps!,"I would not have bought this if I'd known that 100 caps equals only 25 days worth of dosage.Usually if a supplement does not give a listing such as ""4 per day"" then you can assume it's just a one per day dosage.The fact that this requires 4 caps per day means that instead of 15 cents per day, it's 60 cents per day; which is more than I wanted to spend.I will not be buying this formula again unless I see obvious results (which is doubtful because with most herbs and supplements such as this you do not see obvious results, it's more a subtle ""Yeah, I THINK it's helping..."" If I see results after taking the whole bottle I will change this review. Otherwise, it's Sionara to Nature's Life Ginger Joint Ease caps.I also find that this gives me terrible burps, almost to the point of throwing up a little. Maybe this is true of all turmeric, I don't know. All I know is I won't be buying THIS one again. I'm downgrading this to 2 stars."
3,Hoping this will help,"I bought this supplement to find out if it would help my chronic hip and knee pain. Doctors say its arthritis, this is suppose to help arthritis so I'm taking it for 3 months to find out. Only draw back I've found so far is I sometimes have a burp-back after eating and the ginger goes right to my sinuses and burns a bit. The work around is to take the supplement in the middle of the meal."
4,A great gift for the roselover...,This book has beautiful full color photraphs and discusses roses by species. If I were going to try to create a new cross- this book would be helpful. The chapter go into the histories of the different roses... By far the best part of this book.... Has to be the PICTURES!Not a single source book/ this is a book that should supplement your library of ROSES.
4,Decent book with good pictures,"I bought three books on roses, this is the least favorite although I plan to keep in for reference. Nice pictures but it doesn't have a lot of detail on any subject. You get a taste of many things but it left me wanting more."
4,Bigger is mostly better,"This is fine reading for the tired hours of the day. The little biography by his brother Warren is first rate, and the letters themselves are windows looking into the garden of C.S. Lewis' life and thought. They are varied, usually insightful or edifying, sometimes splendid. This edition, edited and enlarged by Walter Hooper, includes a few marvelous additions but also what appear to be some errors in the text, especially in the (fortunately rare) bits of Greek. Let's hope that the Collected Letters (published by Fount in the UK and apparently available through UK) will become available in the USA."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!,First of all when you recieve the DVD it doesnt even #%*^%$ work on the DVD Player it was a waste of money and idk wat type of workout you are getting in 7 damn minutes!!! Dont do it because you will regret it!!!!!
3,Not real impressed,"This cd is okay, but come on this is supposed to be nofx. Nofx has alot of better albums than this."
4,"Good, but not as great as I thought","I'm sorry NoFX is a great band, but I just couldnt give them 5 stars. About half of the cd is great. Murder the goverment, Keep punk rock elite, All outta angst (Which sounds some what like Less than Jake which is not bad at all), and Kill the Rock Stars, but like some songs are just terrible! Whoever wrote Eat the Meek should seriously be drug out on the street on shot, that song is so slow and boring, it really puts me to sleep. But other than that and a couple other songs the cd is great, besides some of the songs being so short. But I still loved this cd, so buy it."
4,good...,"A little faster than Heavy Petting Zoo, but certainly a far cry from earlier days. I heard a new song from them at a show that was pretty fast, though, Clambake or something. I like the first 8 songs, champs elysees is weird, eat the meek is ok, it seems kinda like a farewell album, ""all outta angst, keep punk rock elite, desperation's gone, quit the drink, dead at the end of the album. Slower than Ribbed or White Trash, but shows maturity and is still worth getting. Why only play Punk Rock Elite and Mono Girl from this at the show?"
3,New Album from Punk Legends NOFX,"Ok, this album aint great. One of the biggest problems is the lack of diversity. Some songs sound almost the same. But I dont understnad how NOFX have sold out, as some say!! They are with Epitaph and I have not seen any of their videos ever on MTV. Still, songs like Im telling Tim and It is my job to keep punk rock elite are reasonable punk songs. I would not really reccommend this CD as these guys have made better, still good though."
4,Still a great band,"NOFX can still put out a kickass album each time. Only complaint. The cassette version of ""Murder The Government"" is way more superior. Why they put out two differnt versions I don't know."
4,"Great cd but not as good as ""punk in drublic""","The album is not as good as the earlier album ""punk in drublic""(drunk in public), but it is very close.it just prooves once again that nofx is the best band ever!. Everything about nofx is great but the best thing about them is their lyrics, Fat mike(leadsinger) and el hefe(guitars, and alot of other things) are really gifted!. END"
3,Not that good.,"Well, their handwriting was getting better with each album they put out... but this time, I just can't say the same. Their previous album, Heavy Petting Zoo, was an amazing show of powerful music and excellent lyrics. I was sure this album would be even better than the last one, because the songwriting was supposed to improve too. But I was wrong. Though this album isn't bad at all, it's too rushed, the lyrics aren't that good, and it's VERY monotonous. '180 degrees' and 'I'm telling Tim' are let downs and sound the same. The best songs are '... Punk rock elite', 'Falling in love' , 'All his suits are torn', 'Monosyllabic girl' and 'Dad's bad news', because they are VERY catchy and... I used to sing them in the shower all the time! The only problem is that I got bored really soon. Heavy Petting Zoo and White Trash are much better than this album."
2,NO GOOD,"This cd is possibly the worst NOFX record out there. If you are looking for a good NOFX album , try the older ones . A typical New School release , some bad ska here , some annoying backing vocals there ... I hope they realize that this is not the way."
2,This cd isn't that great,"First of all the average length of the songs on this cd is about 1:10. That is a problem that is the major reason i don't like the cd. A few good songs, if you like NOFX buy punk in drublic, i actually really hate this cd, but im gonna give it two stars anyway."
3,PLEASE STOP WITH THE CORPERATE PUNK ALBUMS,"IT STARTED WITH ""HEAVY PETTING ZOO"" NOFX IS SLOWLY SELLING OUT. HOPEFULLY THEY DONT GET TO A RANCID, OFFSPRING LEVEL BUT IDOUBT THEY EVER WILL CAUSE OF THEIR RAD PAST. THIS ALBUM WAS SO LAME AND CATCHY IT MADE ME ALMOST DISSAPOINTED TO BE A NOFX FAN{SOMETHING WHICH I HAVE NEVER BEEN} IT SUCKED BUT SINCE I GOTTA OWN THEM ALL I STILL STOLE IT FROM MY EX ROOMATE."
2,So Long & Thanks for All the Shoes,"So Long & Thanks for All the Shoes~ NOFX is a not an awfull album but it is just not very interesting and sounds like any other punk album. Simply chords, lyrics that are laced with curse words and seem to be talking about absolutely nothing in particular and sounds like kids playing around with politics but they have no real idea what they are talking about so the end result is that it just sounds trite and forced. Someone should have taught these guys to write decent lyrics instead of these trite and boring schlock that they produce. Knowing how to sing also helps and being able to play your instrument also helps. This album is so boring..but it is not awfull enough to get one star."
2,THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF NOFX'S WORST ALBUMS,"THIS ALBUM WAS LACKING DEDICATION IN THE BAND. IT NOT ONLY HAD FEW SONGS, BUT THEY WERE SONGS THAT DIDN'T HAVE MELODY, OR HARMONY, LIKE THE SONGS ON ""HEAVY PETTING ZOO"". IT HAD TOO MANY SONGS THAT WERE MEANT TO MAKE YOU LAUGH, RATHER THAN SAY"" DUDE, THAT'S A COOL SONG!"" THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH SERIOUS PUNK SONGS, THEY WERE SONGS THAT I SHOULDN'T HAVE WASTED MY MONEY ON, AND YOU SHOULDN'T EITHER, BUT TRY IT FOR YOUR SELF. IF YOU WANT TO HEAR A GOOD ALBUM,THOUGH, LISTEN TO EITHER ""HEAVY PETTING ZOO"", OR ""PUNK IN DRUBLIC"", THEY ARE AWESOME CD'S."
3,NO TALENT PUNK GOES A LONG WAY,"NOFX has been around for a good ten years, and their snide attitude punk rock is not innovative, but effective. Such classics as ""Murder the Government"" ""Monosyllabic Girl"", and ""All Outta Angst"" showcase the secret weapon of the band; which happens to be their undeniable wit. Buried beneath all the snide satire and wit is some solid social commentary, but the listener would never know it by listening to the formulaic 1-2-3-4 punk rock. NOFX's singer has one of the most obnoxious voices in any genre, but it is still an effective formula, even in a genre that lacks originality."
5,For being around for 15 years this CD is cool.,NOFX is fun to lissen to with lots of rythem and skill. This is probly their second best CD Kalena. I know every word on it. Most of my friends like it too.
5,Best of NOFX,"The only reason that I am writing this review is to set something straight. In another review, someone called NOFX a 'so-cal' band. NOFX is a Bay Area band. Listen to ""San Francisco Fat."" I think that's on the ""Live Fat, Die Young"" album. Otherwise, these reviews are on point. This is probably the best NOFX album and also a great introduction to the band for new fans. Either this one or ""Pump Up The Valuum."""
3,not as good as their other albums,"i love nofx, but this album just wasn't that great. There are too many ska type songs on it. Other than that its pretty good."
5,Music to make Michael Bolton choke!,"This was my first NOFX CD and it made me a fan for life! Punk, punk, and more punk. Check out ""all his suits are torn,"" ""kids of the k-hole,"" and ""quart in session"" for just a few examples of why NOFX write the best songs in punk (if not all???) music. Tightly played, infectiously catchy, and with lyrics that say more than just ""party, party, party."" Thinking man's punk? Nah, but fun anyway. Buy this NOW or suffer the fate worse than death of having to listen to dated alt-rock for eternity!"
2,Deadbolt's daily review,"What is the point in having supposedly humorous lyrics if you can't even make out what the hell the guy's singing? He sings as if he has got cotton-wool shoved up both his nostrils and his microphone's getting on a bit...I mean, I've heard poorer, but still, this album flops out of your hand and dribbles onto the floor where is festers and begins to smell, whilst emanating a rather strange guitary kind of sound.The only song that actually rose a little detection of a smile to my face was the ""Murder the government"" one, whatever it is called.This is definitely not an album for talent, not an album for humour, and not an album to buy. Consider taking your money to other better bands. I hate punk and especially this album."
2,hydrofarm GTV4 green thumb grow light system,"The primary problem is that the unit is flimsy. It leans in one direction or another, and is not stable. The string used to adjust the lamp reminds me of having those frustrating window shades that never work right. If I had it to do over again, I would get the cheaper flourescent lamp with metal chains for adjustment."
1,Can not find replacement parts,"The balast has gone out on one of my lights?? I bought a replacement tube but it still doesn't work. I was told I need to go to a lighting repair store to have it looked into. I'm afraid it will cost more than it's worth. Also the unit has ALWAYS wobbled on its feet.Otherwise, it's a great idea."
1,Many better products out there,"I'm an avid indoor & outdoor gardener and seedstarter.I really regret buying this lighting system. It is flimsy, required serious adjustment to get it to fit together, and difficult to raise & lower the light. Overall, extremely poor quality.I only used it for 1 season and then bit the bullet and bought a more sturdy system with 3 bulbs instead of just 2.Don't waste your money on this."
1,Absolute Worst Thing I've Ever Bought From Amazon,"This is without a doubt the worst thing I've ever bought from Amazon. The frame is ""redesigned"" with these plastic quick connectors that are supposed to make assemble a breeze. There is one major problem with that. They are JUNK! The connectors either snapped when you tried to put them together or they wont seat properly in the holes and then you can't get the legs/feet the whole way together. Then you can't get the connectors back out. I'm not sure how the old design went together, but these connectors are way to flimsy to hold everything together. I'm in the process of sending this back for a refund. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,The first product I've ever returned,"First the instructions were not good. I had to go to Hydrofarm website to see the parts and match them with the instructions. When my husband finally got it together, the plug would not stay in the light. If he pressed it in and held it, the light would come one, once he let go the light went off. We finally got it to work and have decided to keep it. I hope I won't be sorry."
5,Great product for seedlings,"I got this light system for starting seedlings indoors to transplant outside. It works great for this purpose. The product is a bit bigger than I thought it would be. I think it would be a great light for kitchen herbs, if you have ample counter space in your kitchen. It breaks down very easily for storage. Keep the box though if you only plan to use it for starting plants so it can be stored safely the rest of the year. It could also be used to keep small citrus plants alive during the winter months, but it will not allow them to flower or produce fruits. I went ahead and got an HPS light for my citrus plants, because they will produce fruit up until december/january, and need much better lighting."
4,A fluorescent lamp can grow veggies,"So far so good. Nice package ,easy setup and so far is growing, carrots, small onions,baby spinach and. cherry tomatoes.They are still young but seem to be growing very well with the T5 lights. The only draw back i see is a poor reflector for the light , seems like Aluminium foil works better.... Still i would Recommend this for anyone needing an adjustable starter/grow light."
4,Hydrofarm JSV4 4-Foot Jump Start T5 Grow Light System,"I am generally pleased with this light system, however, I think that two bulbs would give better coverage for my trays of new seedlings/starts. It wasn't hard to assemble though I did not have the rubber mallet that they suggested was needed...I just used the flat side of my hammer and tapped it carefully. It seems to be stable and not likely to topple over. I found that it was easy to adjust the height of the light."
5,Grow Light system,The Hydrofarm is very well made and adjustable for many situations. I'm very satisfied withit and hope to produce many violets and gloxinias.
2,Not the best but still ok,"First one had broken piece, extention is extra, quality could be better. Hydrofarm must be cutting corners and cheap China crap now.UPDATE Another leg plastic conector broke. Poor quality plastic, Hemp is better including for the ropes!"
5,Works for me,This arrived right on time. My boyfriend had this together quickly with no issues. I am just starting to dabble in flower and vegetable growing so my gardening experience is limited. For the price point I am happy with this.
1,I haven't even used this product for a month and the light bulb is already burned out.,"After less than a month of use the light bulb has already burned out. And, I am having a hard time finding it locally so if I have to order I am out of a light until its sent. Also, they are very costly. For the price they should last longer than 3-4 weeks. I kept it on about 10 hrs a day."
4,decent quality,"Easy to assemble, seems sturdy, the light & pull cord work fine.... but haven't started seeds yet (which is why I only gave it a 4star rating so far)."
1,Very dissapointed,Well I was vert excited when this product arrived at my front door. I was planning on using it to jump start my tomatoes and other vegatables. The assembly of this product was fairly straight forward. I put the bulb in and flipped the switch and the bulb came to life. After a about ten seconds the light died. I went and purchased a new bulb but that didn't solve anything. I guess the unit is fried or something. I never even got to put this over my plants and now I have to go through the hassle of sending it back.
5,Good light,"Lights arrived very quickly, easy to put together, produce a lot of light, and my tomato plants and flower seedlings have grown well. I bought two lights, staggered them side by side on a folding office-type table, and put the setup next to a south facing window. I have no complaints with the light, and will soon disassemble it and store for next season."
5,Excellent product at a great price,"The stand, light, and light height adjustment system are easy to assemble, sturdy, and well-designed. An excellent product at a great price. I am very satisfied and recommend it wholeheartedly to people who want to start vegetables from seeds in a room that already gets light."
4,As expected and rated by others,"I am well satisfied with this grow light - enough to have just ordered another so I can stagger my plant start heights. It is simple to asemble, reasonably sturdy, easy to adjust, and my existing starts are quite happy under it. It is fairly narrow so would be inadequate for a wide spread of plants, hence ordering a second one."
3,Hydrofarm 4 Foot Jump Start,The product appears to be doing what I had expected but I question the sturdiness of the frame. It seems the frame should be thicker.
4,Jump Start,"Just received the product today and the installation was quick and painless. I do agree the stand is not the best design ever, and could use screws at the top, but overall it appears there won't be any issues as it just ""sits there"". I am not sure I agree with some reviews that raising and lowering the light was difficult. It's not feather light, but certainly does not appear cumbersome. Time will tell if this light holds up, but I am optimistic.Packaging was good by the way, no damaged or missing parts."
4,nice but cheap leg fasterns,lite weight easy to handle!but the leg screws are cheap something you would use to hang a picture on a wall.(plastic insert)you cannot get them in with out bending or mashing.better off using self-tapping sheet metal screw. holds a heck of a lot better.other than that is good!
1,Wish it would work!,"No trouble to assemble, seems sturdy, and the system for raising and lowering the light fixture works well. I cannot, however, get the light to come on. It will occasionally flash when I switch it on, but no steady light. I have emailed Hydrofarms to see if they can advise as to whether this signals a defective bulb or whether there might be something else wrong. I hope they can help! I will revisit this review after I hear from Hydrofarm.UPDATE: Received reply in one day from Hydrofarm representative saying she wants to help, and asking for my shipping address and a copy of the invoice. I am not sure what her plans are; perhaps she thinks it is the bulb and is planning to replace that. Or maybe she thinks the light fixture is defective. Will update this review as I hear more."
5,Great product,I have set this up and can not wait to start my seedlings for my garden next month! Thank you
5,Excellent product,"I love my new Jump Start grow light system. It is surprisingly easy to set up and made of quality materials. I can hardly wait until I get all of my planting supplies, so I can watch my grow light work its magic."
2,Not Durable,"I bought this light a bit more than a year and a half ago. I've been using it to grow my plants in the winter and it works well. In regards to some people only getting one bulb or whatnot, I'm not sure why. Maybe they received an ""updated"" model? I purchased mine from the manufacturer though. My lamp contained 2 bulbs and used 2 bulbs. I think everyone would agree on the flimsy design, but what I'm more frustrated with is that my lamp unexpectedly died. I'm not sure what went wrong with it, but it is past the warranty and I must look for another. There is no conceivable way to fix it cheaply (I tried changing both bulbs and pulled the lamp apart to see what I could do). There is no starter to be replaced as on many fluorescent lamps. If I had known it would not be a long term investment, I wouldn't have bought it."
4,Plant starter,This light stand along with some starting beds I already had are a perfect addition to my greenhouse. It is working well and Im going to have some nice Tomato and Tomatillo Plants.
4,Does what it is supposed to do.,"I got this today and had it all assembled in less than 10 minutes. The frame is a bit flimsy, but it really isn't meant to do anything but hold the light up, which it does well. It is a good setup for the casual grower and maybe with a few modifications you could strengthen it up. Overall good purchase."
5,Easy set up,"Great product!!! The rest is to fulfill my obligation to provide extra words which are not needed, buy this if you neede it."
3,A little unhappy,This has worked great except for the fact that the cord used to raise and lower the light fell apart within 2 years. I now have the light wired in place and have to lower and raise the plants.
2,Not easy to assemble,"This was recommended by someone who's blog I follow, so I bought it. I assembled it last night and the rubber ends do not slide into the metal openings easily. I tried pushing them in, but no luck. I ended up breaking off one half of one of the T stands when trying to push the rubber end into the metal opening and injuring myself in the process. Had to use a hammer to get all the rubber ends into the metal openings, which left dents in the metal.It's not very sturdy either and the one I received does not look like the picture shown. The light fixture portion I received is not green on the outside, it's silver. It looks like the light is hanging from wires in the picture, but mine is hanging from plastic cording. Not happy with this at all and is definitely not worth the cost I paid."
4,GREAT LIGHT... MINUS 1 STAR for Stand Assembly,"First-time gardener here...The bulb arrived in great shape...very bright and snapped into place correctly. I have the model with one bulb (not two).I'm taking off 1-star because the stand was difficult to assemble. USE A RUBBER MALLET, if more force is needed. Although the stand is metal, the quick connectors are plastic. One connector broke while I was putting it together. However it was an easy fix with super glue from Home Depot. I got the type of glue specifically for repairs on plastic. After the glue bonded on that one joint, the rest of the stand was sturdy enough.You cannot beat this deal...similar lights at gardening websites cost $200-$400. My local garden store had the 2 foot light on sale for $99 dollars. So I feel it's a terrific bargain to get the 4 foot light for $64 on Amazon.I have sprouts growing under it now; the height was easy to adjust."
5,Works!,"The first one I received was DOA, but amazon reshipped and I had a new one two days later. I've used this to germinate, and to sun bathe seedlings while I wait for spring. It works great. No complaints so far."
4,works great!,"Even tho it isn't much to look at for home use, it works GREAT. I planted some simple tickle me seeds and with the heat mat and this light i had babies in 2 days. The packaging for the seeds said a week. Yes I was amazed at how it cut the time down days. The the lamp adjust so as the plant grows the light can be moved up. I seem complaints on the frame. I have this in my dinning area of my house with a 5 year old and an 11 year old. Not once has it tipped over fell apart. It seems to be sturdy enough for me and my 5 year old daughter to have fun and grow our plants. I love this product and would recommend for anyone growing from seeds."
4,Nice lamp,"I have a large ""Italian Fryer"" pepper plant that had grown nicely under my old lamp. I could only get it to grow one pepper despite babying the plant. I received this unit as a gift and once I put the plant under this light, it is covered with peppers. I guess it is the right light and that makes all the difference. Like I said, the plant was massive and healthy but I could not get it to fruit. The pepper plant I have is too tall for the rack that this light comes on so I have the lamp sitting across a wire plant rack with the plant under it. The plant it about 3' tall and wont squeeze under the lamp. I will definitely buy more of these T5s for my Tiny Tim tomatoes and other indoor pepper plants. Maybe I will buy one of the 4 bulb high output models. Great product. I think some people aren't caring for their plants properly and blaming bad performance on the light. I have had nothing but success with mine."
3,FLIMSY STAND,"IT TAKES MY DAUGHTER TO EXPRESS HOW EXASPERATED I WAS TRYING TO PUT THIS ONE TOGETHER. I APPARENTLY RECEIVED THE WRONG SCREWS (TOO SMALL) AND ANCHORS (TOO LARGE), THERE WERE NO BOLTS ENCLOSED. NOT WANTING TO RETURN THE WHOLE THING, I FINALLY TOOK IT THE HARDWARE AND THEY HELPED ME PUT IT TOGETHER. I HAD TO BUY NEW ANCHORS. I AGREE THE LEGS ARE NOT VERY STURDY. I NEEDED LIGHT ON MY ORCHIDS SO I AM KEEPING THIS UNIT. THINKING OF GLUING THE PARTS TOGETHER TO MAKE THEM STURDIER. ITS AN ATTRACTIVE UNIT, TOO BAD ITS SO UNSTEADY. I'LL BE SOMEWHAT SATISFIED IF THE LIGHT IS SUFFICIENT."
1,broken upon arrival,I never got to see if this worked because it the light bulb was broken when it arrived.
1,Defective,This stopped working after 1 day and now we have to go through the hassle of returning it - complete bs.
3,Hydro farm JSV4 4' jump start T5 grow light system,"I got this for the green thumbs in my family: my husband and daughter as a gift for Christmas. I gave this item a 3 star not because of the quality of the product, (we haven't had the chance to use it yet), but because of the way Amazon packaged this at Christmas. It came in the original manufacturing packaging. My husband comes home from work before I do and retrieves the mail and any packages that have been ordered. He immediately saw the gift and knew what it was and that it was he and my daughter. This was the second gift that was delivered to my door with no Amazon packaging, exposing the original gift for all to see on my porch, as well as the gift recipient. Boo Amazon!"
1,Very displeased!,"When my box arrived, both ends of it were ripped open, and it only had to be shipped from PA to NYy. Upon taking it out of the package, we found that the light was BROKEN. Our package said ""other pieces are being shipped seperately"", but there's no way to see exactly what the items are. Pieces were missing so we couldn't even put it together.. if the light worked. The item is very misleading. We are definitely NOT happy about this product and the way that it arrived at our doorstep. BEWARE if you're going to order."
1,poorly engineered,while the light itself works just fine the frame was impossible to assemble. The hardware included did not work. I had to improvise and make new legs for the vertical bars to stand in. When I was trying to assemble this it became evident that whoever made this did not give a damn about the quality.
2,Misleading Description,"It's an ok lighting system. (It's not actually as flimsy as I anticipated after reading several other reviews.) However, they say it includes ""2 agrobrite light tubes"". It only comes with ONE. And, the light fixture only holds one bulb, so the seedlings I'm growing all tend to bend towards the center reaching for the one bulb. I feel a bit ripped off - there should have at least been a second replacement tube in the box."
5,Wonderful Product,"This is my third purchase of the Hydrofarm JSV4 4-Foot Jump Start T5 Grow Light System. These systems are absolutely fantastic. I have read the other reviews where people were having a difficult time with assembly. As I said, this is my third one, and by this point I don't need the instructions. Assembly is super easy and intuitive. I feel bad for those individuals who were missing pieces and parts, that just hasn't happened to me. This product is solid and absolutely fantastic. I even found it very easy to order replacement bulbs (which I haven't had to use yet, but wanted in storage)."
2,grow light stand,"I am very disappointed in this item. I put it together, expecting to be able to use it today, and it won't turn on! I have double and triple checked to make sure the bulb is in right, and tried several different outlets. I sent an email to the company and I am waiting to hear back from them."
2,Quick Connector Broke on Assembly,"My husband and I were trying to put this grow light system together, but within minutes one of the two-way plastic quick connectors broke when my husband gave it a few taps with his hand to get it into the upright legs. Everything else is metal, but the plastic connector is just too flimsy. I am disappointed, since I already have plants that need the grow light stand now. I cannot figure out any way on the Amazon website to get a replacement connector, since the grow light system is useless without it. Still, I don't want to pay the postage to send this back. I HOPE THAT SOMEONE AT AMAZON WILL PLEASE TELL ME HOW I CAN GET A REPLACEMENT CONNECTOR!!"
5,Plants love these lights,"I am very happy with this planting lighting set up. I can adjust the height as my plants bloom. I am very happy. However, I do recommend that when you order purchase some addl bulbs."
1,"ordered 2, neither works","Sounds like a great product. The stand is fine, the setup is fine, but it doesn't work. I ordered 1 and the lamp would not turn on. I ordered a second, the light goes on and immediately turns off. I play with the switch, and the plug, I can only get the light to flicker on and immediately go off. I contacted HYDROFARM 3 times, twice by email, once by phone and no one will return my call."
2,crapped out after 5 minutes,"this item is nicely designed. sturdy enough for the money. assembled easily. light is bright. turned off light. WOULD NOT TURN BACK ON! PROBABLY THE SWITCH. will send it back for a refund, thankfully amazon has a good policy. Hydrofarm products used to be very good. This is the second HF product I have ordered recently that was defective on arrival. what gives? This item was MADE IN CHINA and shipped in a very bright not stealth box."
4,My seedlings are happy!,This grow light was easy to put together and has really gotten my seedlings thriving. I deduced one star because the on/off switch makes an odd electrical noise like it wants to short out sometimes when I turn it off and on. Hard to describe the noise other than to say it's a quiet popping.
2,Missing pieces & assembly instructions were a joke,This is a good idea but the assembly instructions were a joke and that was even if I had received all of the pieces. There are so many better ways to attach the legs to the frame so I just rigged my own up.
5,Hydrofarm Grow Light Is Doing An Excellent Job In My Greenhouse,"I have a small greenhouse and I'm using this Grow Light to keep my vegetables going. It provides light in Winter to 5 Earthboxes full of vegetables. Does it work? I have 5 planters full of vegetables, some blooming getting ready to fruit, and some squash and cucumbers with fruit on them, and there is ice and snow on the ground outside, very little natural light this time of year.It seems flimsy, and you wouldn't want to kick it around or place it somewhere with lots of traffic and people bumping into it. Otherwise, I haven't a problem with the fact that it isn't SOLID. I move it around a little every day or two to make sure everything is getting some light. It handles that just fine.I'm thinking of getting another one or two. If it wasn't so expensive, I would. I haven't found anything I like better."
5,great value for the price,i think this light is just dandy. it assembled quickly and easily. raises and lowers and gives plenty of lighted space. would definitly buy again.
3,hydrofarm jump start grow light,"the problem with this grow light system is:it's not very sturdybecause there is only one light the new plants tend to lean to one side following the light, 2 or three bulbs would eiminate this problem.the good thing is:the light is a T5 fluorescent bulb that provides the correct color spectrum for growing plants"
4,Does the job,Nice bright light. A bit weak. I like the set up the most. I use the stand to hang other lights.
3,good junk but still junk,i bought 4 of these. they were all packaged the same but when opened them they were of different i guess models. they all did the same some were a little better as far as being stable then others.over all they work pretty well but are not very solid or stable. as long as you can put them in a quite low traffic place they should be ok. for the price there not bad in fact they are a good buy over all. i gave it 3 stars rather then lets say 4 because they were not all the same. if i buy something i want to know what im getting i feel ripped off on the ones that are of lesser quality then the better ones.
5,Love this product,I purchased this to grow seeds and for smaller houseplants. I just love it. Great deal for the money. Easy to put together. I would recommend this for anyone with similar interests.
3,Works well for what it is,"Overall, I'm happy with the set-up but it is a bit flimsy. The T5 light is efficient but really doesn't kick out a lot of lumens. For keeping plants going before plant out, it is sufficient."
3,light system,"This light system is OK and did the job, but really needs two lights; all my plants on the outside of the flats grew in towards the light and I had to keep moving them around so they would grow straight."
4,Good Value!,"It took me about 15 minutes to assemble the unit. I find the draw string lowering system very easy to use, even with one hand! It is not flimsy, but as one other reviewer had mentioned, maybe a longer and bigger screw might make the vertical legs less wobbly? The metal bars are well made, as far as I can tell. Yes, if you have pets, I would not chance leaving it accessible as sudden contact could knock it over.You could easily spend over $150 for a sturdier version, but this will work just as well. Only concern is how easy it it to purchase a replacement bulb?Oh the packing was great. The unit was packed in its original package, and then placed in a bigger box with crumbled paper as cushion."
1,"P.O.S. organizer, pegs break off board very easily","I'm not happy with this socket organizer at all. Broke 2 pegs putting sockets on and 3 pegs taking the sockets off within the first day. The socket pegs are attached to the board with small 4mm (if that) plastic pegs and I could tell right away I had to be careful with this thing. When I went to put my first socket on, it was not easy, they didn't just pop on, it required a little more force than I thought it would. If the pegs were permanently attached to the board then it would probably be a lot better. This organizer will be totally worthless by the end of the week, pretty much there already."
2,not needed,"If you buy ""Lingua Latina: A college companion"", you don't need this booklet. The ""college companion"" is more detailed and expanded, and everything in this booklet, plus more."
1,Nothing Special,"I bought this CD based on a review that called it a""small chunk of honky tonk heaven."" Not true. This is folkmusic with a steel guitar. For pure honky tonk, try Heather Myles or Joy Lynn White."
5,Free to be 'Boz',"""Other Roads"" shows Boz Scaggs' amazing versatility as an artist. He pours his soul -- not to mention his one-of-a-kind vocals -- into rock, blues, pop and jazz, to make a music that is uniquely his. Like ballads? ""Heart of Mine"" is a classic. If you're more into fusion, the tight, funky guitar and keyboard instrumentals in ""Mental Shakedown"" and ""Crimes of Passion"" will definitely get your attention. Each track on this album explores melody, lyrics and arrangement for a very satisfying listen. Boz freely ventures down 'other roads,' and lucky us ... we get to go along and see the musical stuff he's made of."
4,"Competent, even excellent in spots","This is a very solid album (CD, sorry, showing my age).""Heart Of Mine"" is perhaps my favorite song of the 80s, and that's saying something. ""Right Out Of My Head"" is provocative, and all the song are evocative.Trouble is, they tend -- notice, *tend* -- to become 80s-ish and no more. Many of the cuts on this CD could have fit nicely under the closing credits to B-flicks (and did, for all I know).Not to say these are not excellent tunes, well-produced and sung by one of the finest singer-songwriters of the latter 20th century. Just don't expect more than extreme competence.It's great listening, but it's not Silk Degrees."
1,*WARNING* *WARNING*,"*WARNING* *WARNING* This is not really a Boz Scaggs album! I am convinced that sometime during the mid to late 70's Boz was abducted by an alien entity who assumed his identidy. This alien entity obviously had a strong desire to become an American top-40/disco/balladeer/pop star. Gone were the rock/blues influences that defined his career, replaced by dreck that actually included synthesizers, violins, and disco beats! As we all know, this story has a happy ending, evidenced by the 1997 release of ""Come On Home"". Now that's the real Boz."
4,fireworks rocks,"Firewoks is one of my favorite singles of Phantom Power. Its message is great. I mean come on, it IS amazing what you can accomplish when you don't let a nation get in your way. The song's written with the intent to inspire just starting bands out there. If they let the big name record companies and MTV and so on and so forth get in their way, they risk mediocrity and just being famous for five minutes. I mean come on, look what happened to Godie and co.! Well, anyways, enjoy."
5,A LITERARY MASTERPIECE,"Melville's ""Moby Dick"",; Hugo's ""Les Miserables,"" Kafka's ""The Trial""; and now, Schirripa's ""Goomba's Guide To Life"". These are the greatest books ever written, and Steve Schirripa should be proud to have entered the pantheon of the millenium's greatest literary masters.I""m truly honored to have read his work, and look forward to many more books by this genius of the English language."
2,Boring,"This attempt to cash in on the Sopranos is a misleading view of growing up in Bath Beach. Mr. Schirrpa left Brooklyn at an early age for Las Vegas, went to Brooklyn college, not the school of hard knocks on Bath avenue. One is better off with real mob related books."
4,"Pretty ture stuff, and a bit funny, but misses some points","Found this book to be pretty good, but if you want a full perspective on Italians and Italian Americans then you must read ""The Golden Milestone - Over 2,500 Years of Italian Contributions to Civilization."" It covers Rome, Renaissance and modern events and Italian Americans too."
5,Nature's Medicine,"This book is beautiful It has full color pictures. It also has lots of information. Maps and locations on where the plants are usally found. It is a thick hard cover book. A great addtion to anyones library. Great for gardening, medicine or science."
3,Missing in action...,"First off, I must say that I enjoy researching jazz groups of the 1960's. I was, however, somewhat dissapointed with this particular selection. The facts are there, true. The ability to grasp the readers attention, however, was just not there. I found this book to be boring at times, and it appears to state fact after fact. It may be good for strictly definately lacking and does not captivate the research, but for your reading enjoyment, it is readers attention."
1,nice,"the story was nice. the hero was mad because he had to marry for money, but he had no problem entertaining the mistress with that money. the heroine was ungrateful too. her father loved her, but she had no problem considering herself a duke's daughter, who did not claim her. if she disliked what her father did, why take his money? at the end there was no question that the hero and the heroine loved each other."
4,Bigger Fun,"This third installment in the Yo Miles! series is a clear improvement over the previous, ""Sky Garden."" This is a superb band that features Wadada Leo Smith, Henry Kaiser, Mike Keneally, Michael Manring, Steve Smith, Zakir Hussain, and many more - all taking on extended jams built around motifs played by the classic Miles Davis funk/fusion groups of the early 70's. Where the ""Sky Garden"" jams got a little long-winded, especially during slower, freer sections, ""Upriver"" is considerably ups the energy and funk content. Many tunes stand out, but the relentless ""On the Corner"" into a hyper-aggressive ""What I Say"" is most exciting. Smith's ""Thunder and Lightning"" is probably the best original tune that the group has recorded and has a neat, slinky bass groove from Manring. As a dual-layer CD/SACD, this is an excellent value for the money."
1,disappointed...,"I bought these as a Christmas gift for my daughter-in-law to match their Corelle pattern. Corelle is a delicate looking china, but these were just HUGE & seemed to not go with that style at all. The trim color was the same, but the size looked like it would not belong to Corelle!! We both were very disappointed. In comparison, these looked like adult dishware compared to child dishes (their Corelle plates)."
1,fluff.. a waste of money and even worse.. time,"I found Peterson's first book very valuable and interesting. This one was clearly thrown together, to ride on the success of the previous one. I read it in one sitting, found myself skimming sections and finding some sections too silly to have been published. For example ""Advantages of the OBE over Space Exploration: Space exploration will never tell us what lies beyond the veil of death."" did he write that? ""OBE costs less."" now he's wasting my time and padding the book, ""No special degrees.. no special equipment"" and ""OBE Disadvantages: With OBEs you can't collect any physical samples"" ... ANYONE intelligent enough to read, that has every heard of OBE.. oh well, i'm not going on to argue this... It's unbelievable that this could get printed. Now that I reread this fluff, i'm insulted that he got my money for such stuff. Peterson, you should be embarassed. There's certainly more than one lesson you haven't learned."
2,not as good as his first book,"I bought this book with great anticipation because his first book was so good but was disappointed. Not as much OOBE techiques or experiences out of of the body, but he talks a lot about his life for example how he eventually met his wife and got married. Granted this book was supposed to be more on the spiritual side but I really didn't find that this book reflected that. If you have the first book, I don't think you need the 2nd book for OOBE."
2,"Nice artwork, but annoying characters","Clamp does beautiful artwork in this series as well as X/1999. In fact, the artwork was what persuaded me to buy this manga without having read the storyline. Bad move! It's not that the story is bad... it's just that the main characters are extremely formulaic and lacking in depth. The fact that one of them was a crybaby didn't help. If you're looking for a story that is going to draw you in and intrigue you until the last page, then this isn't right for you. You're better off checking out Inu Yasha or Sanctuary."
3,lots of info; many errors,"You'd expect a book on its 3rd edition to be fairly free of errors; not this one. After reading about ""attenuation budge"" in several places (""attenuation budget""), and ""190 dB"" where it should say ""19 dB"", I lost trust in the information I did not know much about. Beware."
1,Too long,"This book should have stopped at chapter 4. From the book:Chapter 5 - Networking Hardware & SoftwareChapter 6 - Bridging and SwitchingChapter 7 - RoutersChapter 8 - Wireless EthernetChapter 9 - Security (covers access-lists, anti-spoofing, checkpoint firewalls)Chapter 10 - Managing the NetworkWhy on EARTH is there a chapter on router access-lists, Checkpoint firewalls and proxy servers in a book on Ethernet???"
2,"General network, and not specific enough for modern equipment","The book didn't provide much help explaining the ethernetand internet settings on a computer or router.The following terms could not be found in the book:DDNS (Dynamic Domain Name System)Dynamic or static IP address,Virtual Server/Port Forwarding,PPPoA (Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM),PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet),RFC 1483 encapsulation,NAT (Network Address Translation)VCI (Virtual Circuit Identifier),VPI (Virtual Path Identifier),UPnP (Universal Plug and Play).Terms that are covered include:DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol),DNS (Domain Name System),Gateway,MAC address (Media Access Control),MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit),Point-to-point in general,RIP (Routing Information Protocol),Subnet Mask."
2,Long-Winded,"Reading this book will probably be satisfactory for supplementing whatever class you're taking, but God is it boring. The author takes 5-6 pages to get around to saying anything at all, so by the time you've finished reading a thirty page chapter you realize the good bits could have been explained in four pages.The book's biggest hinderance is that the author reflects a less than satisfactory understanding of ethics. I may be wrong, but it seems that in order to write a book about ethics as they pertain to the mass media one should have at least a fair understanding of ethics in general. You'll find a better explanation of historically influential ethicists and their teachings on a poorly written wiki article."
1,Not what I wanted...,"I am moving to the UK in a few months, and wanted to get an overview of the various soccer leagues (FA, Premiership, etc.), the organization of the teams, etc. This book provided little to none of this. It appeared only to give a detailed (I mean detailed) history of all the teams. I still can't tell you how the various leagues are set up, how teams move to different leagues, etc."
4,A layman review,The book is a classical work on this very specific topic and contains a summary which is understandable to the layman of nearly one century of work on those equations. It is a very good start to follow more recent work on that topic
4,honeysuckle vine,"Arrived quickly in good shape. 4"" pots with 12"" to 18"" vines. We've just planted them so we have to wait and see if they are healthy and will thrive but so far so good!"
5,Price Hike,"I give these bags a 5 for quality, but less than zero for price.When I first bought these bags they were$42.00, and that was two years ago.Now, when I want to reorder, the price has gone up 50%.Another member suggested the Kirkland 33 gal. bag, for less money.I went to Costco, and paid $16.00 for 90 bags. That's $32.00 for 180 bags, not 150, and I think they're better bags.Even if you don't have a Costco membership,the Kirkland bags on Amazon cost a lot less than the ""glad"" bags. If Glad wasn't so greedy I would never have considered the Kirkland. Buh bye Glad."
5,Perfect,"Perfect size, perfect strength, and now that I can order by the case I'm not likely to run out the night before trash pick up."
1,What a watse of money! Don't buy this phone!,"I bought this phone today and thought it would we great for 70 bux, but I was wrong. The corded phone sounds great at first but then the sound cuts out like someone pressed mute on the volume and you can't hear a thing. The cordless phone sounds like a robot is talking into it. I thought i was getting a DEAL but i got a DUD instead. DONT BUY THIS PHONE, SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING GOOD!"
2,You get what you pay for,"We have had this phone for a while and am ready to move on. The price was right but we are getting tired of the continuous ""I can barly hear you"" complaint. The range is somewhat disappointing for 5.8 GHz. In addition the phone has recently started to interfere with my dsl conection. My guess is it is somehow feeding noise back through the dsl filter. I have to unplug it to use the internet. Very annoying."
2,caller ID doesn't work,"This phone is pretty darn good for a chord phone (the cordless is pretty bad and often cuts out, but I don't use it much so that's ok) The thing that really annoys me is that the caller ID doesn't work. It will show the # while the person is calling, but when you scroll back to see the # most of the time you only see the name. Other than those two problems it's a descent phone."
2,Okay phone - horrible battery life,"I bought this phone a year ago because of its features. In comparison to my previous cordless it had more - but at a cost. I don't know if the features are a factor but the battery on the cordless is awful. My previous cordless was a GE phone and it lasted for days off the charger. The uniden doesn't last even a few hours off the charger, whether I use it or not. And when the battery is low I have only a few seconds of warning while on the phone before it turns off. Not enough time to get to the landline. I leave it on the charger and that doesn't even help extend use during phone calls. I do like the features and like that it has a corded main station for when the power goes out. Just wish that the battery were better. Going back to GE. It lasted forever between charges, even when in use."
1,Features good. Range terrible.,"I like the features of this phone but the range is terrible. Our old 900MHz phones went from inside the house to outdoors by about 200'. This phone goes about 35'. I can't even get across the house even with line of site. The base stations are located in the same place in both cases. I replaced it with another Uniden and got the same results. Today I went to the local Staples store and the sales guy told me that he has had a lot of Uniden's returned for exactly this reason. He recommended ATT, VTECH or Panasonic. I didn't buy. I'm looking for range comparison reviews on the web now. On the plus side the built in answering machine other features of the Uniden phones are excellent."
2,Upgrading from 900Mhz for longer range....NOT!,"Sigh....The old 900Mhz had a longer range. I'm thinking of taking the thing apart so that I can get to the attenna line and connect an external one to increase the range, or perhaps I should just accept the loss and buy a more expensive phone."
1,Do not buy this from Amazon,"Have heard good feedback on this phone from all over the net. Just a advise to everyone, do not buy this from Amazon. It is more prudent to pay a $ 1.5 extra and get it from Target.I have ordered this phone from Amazon about 3 weeks back and still do have it with me. I am not sure if I will ever get it. This is my last purchase from Amazon.Advise to all do not nuy from her..at least this particular item."
1,Cordless Phone is Useless,"The phone seemed good when purchased, but after a short time of six months the cordless phone does not pick up volume well making the talker yell in order for the listener to hear a conversation."
1,"Good answering machine, but bad phone.","THE CORDLESS PHONE IS USELESS!! THE ANSWERING MACHINE WORKS FINE BUT THE CORDLESS PHONE IS A JOKE...""CAN U HEAR ME?"".CORDLESS PHONE HAS NOOOOOOO SPKR BUTTON AND, THE ENTIRE FAMILY HATES THIS PHONE, BECAUSE WE CANNOT HEAR THE PERSON ON THE OTHER LINE SO WE HAVE TO TALK THROUGH THE BASE PHONE WHICH IS ALSO LESS THAN GOOD.BY THE WAY NOW I AM IN THE MARKET FOR ANOTHER CORDLESS PHONE. SHAME ON UNIDEN!!!!!"
4,Good phone system for a decent price,"I like this phone system a lot. I had been on a cell-phone only kick until I moved into a place that had no cell service at all. The old portable phone that I pulled out of my closet to use had horrible reception. I really needed a great phone to talk to my boyfriend who is out of town on jobs long stints at a time (thus, we need to talk on the phone all the time). He actually found this one on Amazon and suggested it to me. We're both very happy with the results.I do live in an apartment complex, so the reception seems slightly muddled at times, possibly due to phone signals from nearby neighbors? However, if I'm in a room adjacent to where the base is, I seem to be ok. The answering machine and main part of the phone are very user friendly and work just great."
4,Satisfied with this purchase,"I purchased this product for my elderly mother; she is not into all the 'bells and whistles' so I have no experience one way or the other with all the extras. I was intimidated that I had to assemble the whole unit, but it went quickly and well. I did have some problems inserting the battery for the cordless because of the wires, but that worked out. My mother needs, for more than convenience, two phones, with one being cordless. I did some research on the web and checked out what is sold at Costco, knowing that they tend to sell the top two or three brands of items - this model was there, so I felt really comfortable with this purchase. My mother is pleased; she said the sound is clearer than on her previous cordless phones. So, so far, after a couple of months at least, it was a good purchase. The only reason for the 4 rather than the 5 was because it had to be totally assembled - not an easy task for some (my mother would not have had the wherewithall to do it)."
3,Does the Job,"I bought this phone because of all the great reviews about it on amazon. It is an ok purchase, but I can hear the entire conversation of anyone that is using both the grounded phone and the portable. Also in my apartment, the portable phone does not get reception in the kitchen which is the reason I bought a new phone in the first place.All in all I sould probably have spent some extra money to buy a better one, but for now this one does the job."
1,CAN'T USE HANDSET MORE THAN FEW FEET FROM BASE!!!,"Prosaffordable full featured (records conversations, handset feels good in hand, unit has corded phone back up for power outages.ConsCAN'T USE HANDSET MORE THAN FEW FEET FROM BASE!!!No mention was made in the literature that the handset cannot be moved more than a few feet from the base unit for reception of signal.When I called Customer Service they said that was expected behavior. I said I'd had other 5.8 GHz phones and could traverse entire house and even yard from same base location.They said that was a 5.8 Digital not ANALOG phone.......This makes the phone virtually worthless.I tried every suggestion onm website for that symptom. No improvement. Very diappointing performance. Unacceptable."
5,As advertised and works very well,Have had this unit in place for more than a month. Every thing works as advertised and has some nice features. There are a confusing number of buttons with some titles not untuitively indicative of the the function that will be performed. Sound is excellent and have no interference on both the wireless and hard wired functions. I have a wireless system for my computer and it has not had any effect on the operation. Would recommend this to anyone who wants the available features and needs only one remote unit.
2,Bad cordless phone,"We bought this phone with the hopes of having one corded phone (in case of power outages) and one cordless phone. The cordless phone works intermittently. It does not matter how close or far you are from the base, sometimes the volume just cuts out. It does not hang up on the person you are talking to, just the volume acts as if it drops down to ""1"" and you can't hear what they are saying. We now can only use the corded phone.In the past I have been very happy with Uniden, I will be returning this phone perhaps for a Motorolla."
1,Uniden Service,"I bought my new Uniden phone from Amazon and found upon setting it up that it did not ring or go to the answering machine. I called the customer support number in the users manuel and they told me I would have to return it to the address listed. I did that and waited almost a month for a replacement. The replacement was an old, rebuilt dirty unit with nicks and scratches. That's Uniden's replacement for a new phone that doesn't work. Not good customer relations."
1,Not good,"Like other reviews have stated the cordless is absolutely horrible! Theres a lot of static even when I'm right next to the base, how crazy is that? Theres random clicking noises (is someone tapping my phone line?? no it's just a poorly made unit) and don't think about moving far away from the base, because you wont hear a thing.The corded unit is OK, it has a pretty cool recording feature that lets you record your conversation, but theres an annoying beep you hear every 10 seconds or so and the other person can hear it too.Well I think I'll return this to where I bought it, I thought it would be good since I live in an apartment and don't need much range for a cordless phone, but even standing next to the base it I get horrible static. Pfft buh bye."
2,A little Disappointed,"Before I purchased this product I researched Consumer Reports. This phone rating well with CR. I also read some of the reviews on Amazon's site. Well the cordless handset had a little static and the call was not clear. Also, people kept complaining of not being able to hear me on the speaker phone on the base.Needless to say my Uniden 5198 is headed back."
3,Solid phone,"The phone is a user friendly, sleek, solid phone. The only complaint I have is that there seems to be more static in this 5.8 GHz than in my old phone which was not."
1,Low Range bad bad bad,What a disappointment. This phone had very low range so tommorow it goes back. I had no problem with the base station but the cordless phone was noisey and I couldn't walk very far before it craped out. It would be a great phone if you wanted to stay in the same room with the base station.
4,Phone and Portable Phone,"I love MOST everything about this phone, but I HATE that the handset does NOT have a speaker button on it. I can NOT go hand's free with the handset. I like that I can store numbers. The base DOES have a speaker button. It is compatable with my headset and I like that the ringer can be turned off or down. I work out of my house and this is great if someone is trying to sleep. The handset has a pretty good range and sound quality is fine. If I buy another phone, I will make sure that the phone that is a handset only has a speaker phone. For that reason, I wouldn't buy this again even though I like it a lot. I am frequently wishing I a speaker button on the handset only part of the phone."
3,"Good phone, but a little tempermental","This is a pretty good phone. The only problems we've had with it so far (it's been about a month) are that it cuts out on a call when another call is coming in on call-waiting and the speaker phone microphone does not seem to be that strong.Otherwise, it's pretty good."
4,Good office phone,"Can't speak to the cordless handset - don't use it. But as for the base. Sound quality is good, messages are clear, easy to use. Only minor complaint is that the mic for the speakerphone is not very good. People on the other end often complain they can't hear me. Other than that, phone is great. I'm currently using 2 of them in my home office and no problems with either in almost 2 years."
1,Answering machine don't work voIP,The answering machine works only part of the time with road runner. outside of that the phone is good. great customer support from office depot.
5,Just what I needed at a great price!,"I am very impressed with the functions and price of this phone. It has speakerphone, callerid, an answering machine, and can store numbers. The only thing I can find wrong with it is that there is not a battery meter on the cordless handset, but that is just a small inconvenience. The phone sits very securely and tight in the cradle on the corded uncorded units. This was a concern I had, as I hated leaving phones accidentally off the hook or not sitting properly to recharge the battery. Very economical and useful!"
5,We like it,"This phone works well. And the price is great! The sound quality is much better than our old cordless phone and the range is quite far. I like that the base phone and the cordless hand-held are separate. It helps keep our desk area from being too crowded with electronics gear. The 5.8 GHz does not interfere with our other household wireless network(s). I'm glad that we purchased this Uniden phone. It suits our needs and fits our budget. I would recommend it. One thing that we have not used is the answering machine feature. I assume that it would work fine, as well."
3,My Uniden CXAI5198 is sufficient.,"My vtech 2.4 HGz GIGAphone finally died during a power outage. After reading the reviews I purchased the Uniden. It is not as good as I expected, but it is good enough that I won't put it in a drawer and buy another one. If I could do it over, I'd buy another vtech. The reception on the Uniden is not nearly as consistent as the Uniden. I live in a hilly, rural area so this is important - few cell phones are able to transmit where I live. The answering machine included in the Uniden is a good one; it works easily and well."
3,Bye bye Uniden- Hello Panasonic,"I really didn't want to return this phone. I loved the idea of a corded base phone with a huge called ID display, and a satellite 5.8 ghz cordless. And the sound was excellent, both on the answering machine and the cordless. So whats not to love?The Caller ID only displays raw caller ID info. Even though you may have ""Jack's"" name already store in phone memory, the caller ID doesn't retrieve this data- it perpetually spits out raw call data such as ""cellular call"", and there's nothing you can do to customize it.It seems that Uniden is too cheap to match the caller ID data to the data stored in phone memory. I read similiar complaints on other Uniden models.It's a shame. I really do like this phone. But it's bye bye Uniden, and hello Panasonic KX-TG5632M"
3,"Good Phone, But needs some improvement, Save money, buy 2.4 ghz","Pros:I trust in Unidens quality. Very clear, long lasting cordless.Cons:Speaker option on Base phone is not very good. People cant hear me. I have another base phone (From ATT) with a speaker option and people hear me well.Annoying red light has to be on when the answering machine is in on mode. I think it is good that it blinks to let you know there is a message, but the constant red light is a distraction to the room.Cordless Phone needs a speaker option. I thought this phone had this function, I thought I read that it had it in a write up, so it is my fault.Recommend:I recommend you buy a headset from walmart to allow your hands to be free to do work.I later bought 2 more portable phones from walmart at 2.4 ghz and notice no difference in clarity. I dont know if 5.8 ghz is needed for everyone."
1,Uniden review,This is not a great phone. The cordless phone has static and makes some weird clicking sounds. You can't take the cordless too far from the base. I wouldn't buy this phone again.
4,A LOT for A LITTLE!,"The corded base set works great with many features, not the least being that it still works if electric goes out. For the price, I suppose this should be enough. However, in the rural ozark hills of AR, the cordless does not work outside the house. It does work as expected inside. Many cell phones have problems in our hills so I don't know if it's the phone's fault or our area. The phones have a walkie talkie feature I was hoping to use but since cordless does not work outside, the feature is useless. Once again, the cordless is OK in the house."
5,At Last a Phone System for us.,"We tried a half dozen other brands and 5,8 GHz systems and took them all back. Not this one! It's perfect. Easy setup, superb voice quality, all the features we deem necesary, a great easy-to-use manual, and well designed versatile controls.As for the other brands we treied, we couldn't live with them! Some flunked on every thing mentioned above, some 9on a few points, but all flunked on voice quality! This baby is a jewel!"
2,Jerry FL,"I am disappointed in the phone. The display is almost impossible to read except in bright light. The base has no battery back-up, so if you lose power, you lose your greeting and speed-dial numbers. The unit has an ""in use"" light, but it only works if you are using the remote, not the base. It should be called ""remote in use"". Given the cost of the unit, and it's good rating by Consumer Reports, which why I bought it, I think you can find much better equipment out there at comparable prices."
2,"Houston, we have a problem","This is a nice compact and easy to use base phone. However, the analog cordless phone that is part of the package is not clear, has static, and cuts off conversations after 5 minutes. I keep it in the charging base, and I don't think it is placed too far away from the base. The base unit is in my kitchen and the cordless is on my desk in my office. I estimate about 40'away in a ranch home. I also purchased a hands-free microphone to wear so I can use my computer while I talk, but the same problem of static and cut-off happens. If Uniden feels the cordless is too far away from the base, then it is basically useless. Why have a cordless if you can walk to the next room to answer the phone? I am going to contact Uniden online and if they have no solution will return the phone."
5,Great phone for the money,I've been using this phone for over a month now and no problems. Reception is great and I like that I can use the base during a power outage. This phone is very easy to set up and has my favorite feature - speed dial. Other phones I have had use a phone directory and I hate having to find the number I want by scrolling - please - if I wanted to do this I'd use my cell phone. The answering machine is clear and I like that I can turn off the message alert if I want to - I've left it on for now. Plus it lists old and new messages. I did have an AT&T E5965C with Caller ID announce and loved that feature. But I had so much trouble with it that I threw it out after only 3 months and 3 returns for repair. So I'll for go the announce for a good quality phone that works.
4,Good Product,"I bought this product based on a recommendation from Consumer Reports magazine. It is easy to figure out and use, and comes with good instructions. I like that you can enter the phone number before you actually dial it - easy to correct mistakes. The digital answering machine is nice, too - no more tapes! A solid unit that has fulfilled all my expectations."
2,Cordless is useless,"I've had this phone for over a year. I've purchased Uniden in the past and thought quality wouldn't be an issue. However, like many reviewers here, the handset is horrible. I have a small apartment and the cordless either frequently has static or cuts out completely. On a positive note- the answering machine and base work great."
3,Uniden Cordless Phone & Answering System,"Very pleased with the phone answering system and the fact the cordless does not have to be plugged to a live phone line; however, the cordless phone sometimes cuts off while in use."
4,power full cordeless phone with cheap price,"A good phone system with many functions, but the memory for quick dial can only store 20 digital for one dial, it's not good enough for me to store a IP phone card dialing yet."
4,Phones with lots of features,I like the ease of use with these phones. There is a bit of white noise in the background when using the cordless.
5,One of My Favorites,I can't begin to put into words how much I love this book. It is one of my top 3 favorites.
4,Suger bowl,"First one arrived damaged. Was quickly replaced by Amazon. Nice looking and does its job, but be careful it is very fragile and will break if droped."
4,"Simple, homey for the kitchen",Looks nice and holds a lot of sugar. Only wish it came with a sugar spoon.
3,Making the best out of money,"2005 hits and so does the Grammy Nominees, and here is a complilation of the famous songs from different artists. The cover seems attractive, with a glaring gold-like color and some kind of funky fonts. I don't see why they put in ""Burn"" instead of ""My Boo"", and other artists should not even be in this list such as Beastie Boys or Los Lonely Boys. There are so many choices out there and if this album ever gets hot, its because people are downloading from the internet already."
2,Save your money and record off the radio!,"For the past several days this week all the local radio stations have been constantly playing all of this year's Grammy nominated songs, especially if they were the songs that won. Almost all the songs on this CD have already been over played on the radio to begin with, so why would you want to spend up to $20 for a CD of songs which are already tired? If you're sort of old school like me, then you remember using blank tapes to record your favorite songs off the radio. Do that instead."
1,The Verdict Is In . . .,"YAAAAAAAAWWWWWWNNN! Don't even bother buying and listening to this CD. Every song on here lacks emotion, meaningful lyrics, and any type of memorable melody. Standards are set so low that any untalented fool can get a record deal, sample to their hearts content, and win a Grammy. Skip this and get Stevie Wonders greatest hits collection."
1,Total garbage.,"This collection shows us, Jack and Jill public, how narrow minded the Grammy voters are today. Not one track on this so-called collection is worthy of a listen or a grammy nod. QUIET."
4,CD misc. artists,"Got this as a gift. Recipient didn't care for it, but the service from seller was very good. Arrived well packaged and in a reasonable time."
3,"""Expectations Not Met""","Okay, Okay so this album is mostly horrible.Wrong: If I Ain't Got You is very overrated and way overplayed put J-Kwon Tipsy in instead. Burn is gay like any other Usher song and is overplayed, put in 99 Problems by Jay-Z in instead. You Had Me switch with Take Me Out by Franz Ferdinand. Redneck Woman. News flash, COUNTRY MUSIC SUCKS!!!!!Right: Tribute to Ray Charles. A very mature choice and the right one. Brian Wilson, U2, Beastie Boys,and Prince. Kudos to the Grammy Selecties for giving the Grammy audience the option of tribute. Green Day. The best song on the album and their lives. Good Job. Kanye West. This is the one song I like that involves him.Boring: Los Lonely Boys. The first verse in heaven is okay but after that yawn!Overall: Promising album but worse than I expected. 3.14/5"
4,Great introduction!,"McGrath gives an introduction, that inspires you to go on reading theology. He writes clearly, in an easy way so that almost everyone can understand. Especially his way of introducing you to the history of dogmatics in the beginning gives you a boost."
5,In Reserve,"I started this book. It's loaded. So, I've reserved it for a class I will be taking this fall. So far it's been very captivating, informative and of course factual."
5,A Good Handshake to Start A Conversation,"""Christian Theology"" is truly an excellent introduction to the subject of theology. Within its mere 603 pages Alister McGrath covers the gambit of theology (both historic and modern approaches). He gives fine surveys of the main lines of thoughts that theology has followed through out Christian history, and discusses the ""whys"" and ""where for's"" of each school of thought. It is no wonder that some many seminaries and colleges are using ""Christian Theology"" as their Systematic Theology text book. ""Christian Theology"" is not a new Systematic Theology, and Dr. McGrath does not introduce a new principle on which he could build a theology (that is not the purpose of this book). Rather, in his characteristically easy to read style, he surveys what has happened within theology and prepares the reader to begin reading further within theology."
1,Not even worth 44 Cents,I got this book because there were 60 copies available and one cost only 44 cents on Amazon.com. Now I know why. This is not a good novel. In fact it stinks. I hear that it is a sequel. That is really funny. I have to wonder about the quality of the first one that apparently motivated the author to consider writing part two. Pretty slim pickins here.
2,The Quality Stops Here!,"If this is a sequel to a first book written by this author, perhaps he should stop here and start in a new direction. Where does he get the ideas for an Amish boy in a T-bird and Elvis impersonators and Admiral Peary's expeditions? Not only do they not add up together, but they are not relevant. My suggestion is to find a theme like boy meets girl or Good vs. Evil and give it a Charles Dickens onceover."
2,Disappointing,This is a sort of pathetic effort. Why would anyone write a sequel to an earlier book that nobody was ever interested in the first place? Just how does two army brats translate into anything even remotely universal. Two stars because this was a little better than the first one.
5,Must Read,Anyone interested in the connection between healing herbs and the Medical world should read this book. An excellent read. I reccommend the poem inside.
2,Did not work for my Dell,The battery I received would not work with my Dell Axim X3. I contacted the Brilliant Store's customer service and they sent me different battery. I haven't received that one yet so not sure if it will work. I was very pleased with the customer service.
2,the picture is decieving,What they show is not what you get!!!!!I can't use my Rhinoskin with this battery....Most Bogus dude...
4,Bigger than advertised.,"I ordered this item and it was a X111 but at 2000mAh. Not the same size, has the extended casing."
4,Amazing Book!,This book is a fascinating biography about one of the world's true adventurers. I read it 15 years ago and plan to read it again. This book would be wonderful for young and old to read as it displays the power of the human spirit.
2,The Intelligent Women's guide to Man-hunting,The author wrote this some time ago. Would like to see more timely info. from him. I did not find it interesting as it seemed too antiquated.
5,A perfect book!,This book is wonderful both visually and written. I learned so much about beads and got so many ideas for projects. This is a wonderful addition to my reference books.
3,Beautiful illustrations but not terribly helpful.,Beautiful illustrations and fun to look at but only some of the jewelry includes instructions to recreate. I found the book to be a disappointment in my continual pursuit to try to create beautiful and unique jewelry. It almost seemed like more of a textbook on beads then instructive.
1,Don't Buy This,"This is the first bead book I've seen that has ""plastic beads"" as a bead classification. In fact ""plastic beads"" occupies the same amount of space that is alloted to ""semi-precious beads"" (2 pages), ""metal beads"" and ""novelty beads"". If you're looking for photos of different types of semi-precious beads, keep looking elsewhere. The price was cheap, (with good reason) and the cost of return shipping makes it not worth returning it."
3,Book of Beads review,"The book was well-packaged and quickly sent, thank you. The book itself gives good descriptions of various beads and their origins but should not be bought if many designs are being sought. The pictures are clear and colourful and the book will be used for general reference."
4,Gorgeous Pictures -- Like Candy for the Eyes!,This book has absolutely gorgeous pictures that also provide inspiration. Has sections on various types of beads (along with pictures of them) and basic how-to's in the back. Excellent for beginners and/or anyone looking for design ideas.
2,De-Phazz - Natural Fake,"NATURAL FAKE kicks off with ""Un Ange Passe"" which slinks back to De-Phazz's easy-listening jazz roots, but the album quickly slips into a pleasant mediocrity after that. Oh, there are bright spots, like the perky ""Astrud Astronette"" (even though the lyrics are rather silly) or ""Depression Royale,"" which harkens back to the glory of GODSDOG. But even the usually-excellent Barbara Lahr has her vocals flattened on ""Eternity Is..."" (though she also redeems ""Multicoloured Destiny""). There are small moment of surprise too, like the French lyrics and banjo plucking on ""Excursion En Mer,"" but overall, pleasingly forgettable."
1,This is not the De Phazz I remember,"I've just got this album yesterday, after I listen to it, I gotta say it's JUST NOT the de phazz that I like from "" Godsdog "" and "" Death by chocolate "", this album is totally blank and has no tastes, compared to the above two albums that full with contents and colors... so if you really like de phazz or want to try it , go to the album in 1999 and 2001.."
3,Develope 10 program nail treatment,"I have used this product for years and love it this stuff really works, but the last 2 times that I ordered it I didn't get the original product that I bought. There is a slight difference in the bottles and it is hard to tell when you order from the picture. What I got is thicker then the original and doesn't go on as nice. I just wish I could tell the difference so I can get the right one. My nail split and peel if I don't use this, it is the only thing that has ever left me grow my nails out."
5,Great Songwriting!!!,Production and mix need lots of work. But songs and vocals by Jeanine Acquart are great. Plus she is absolutely beautiful! I've saw her in concert in Salt Lake City.Definately one of this decades great songwriters.
5,"Dark, but full of love and sensuality.","Dawning in many ways reminds me of Echo and the Bunnymen, Gene Loves Jezebel, The Church, All About Eve, and The Cure. Its dark, but full of love and sensuality.The darkwave/gothic genre has been missing something in recent years that it once had. Paris Burning does an excellent job of delivering an Old School feel. They, however, have their own style and drive that seperate them from the rest."
5,MINDBLOWINGLY GOOD CD,"That review below by Mr Dandy is ridiculous. I love this album, it moves me every time I put it on. I listen to it for sheer pleasure as well as for a potent reminder of what our soldiers must be thinking and feeling in Iraq. Bleckmann's distant vibratoless voice perfectly captures the numbing, conflicted reality of the everyman who serves, the ""everysoldier"" at war. My wife loves this cd too, as do my co-workers. As my son says, this is the sh-t!"
2,Medoicrity from Downtown,"On high praise from the NYTimes I blindly bought this disc and at first listening I was so enthralled by the text that I didn't realize how mediocre the music really is. I'll give it to Kline that he knows how to pick good texts but the music is just stagnant and fails to capture the intensity or drama of succesful minimalism, a school from which he clearly hails. His use of electric instruments makes pop-rock sound avant-garde and the interludes are incredibly tiresome sound-collage affairs. Ultimately it makes for an intersting one time listen but fails to say anything powerful. Borrow this from the library if you have to but don't waste your money."
5,Excellent,"A nice addition to any snake library - I enjoyed reading this and hope it raises the popularity of this underated group. Basically, it contains everything you need to keep, raise and breed these species and contains instructions on how to prepare food to prevent thiamin deficiency. If you keep water and garter snakes - buy it!"
4,Northern Italian map,"The map was used before our trip and at night during our trip to review the day as well as to plan the next days adventures. During the day we relied on our Garmin loaded with a much more expensive Northern Italy/Eastern France database. One tidbit from flying - nothing fills your field of vision quicker than an opened (paper) map. So unless your co-pilot is good at quickly folding/re-folding to show only the map panels of immediate interest, go with a GPS. The Michelin maps are printed on a fairly durable map so they should hold up nicely for a week or two trip."
5,An excellent commentary on the Psalms,"Terrien's commentary on Psalms is both an excellent work and writing. As much as it is enlightening to read his exposition of the Psalms, it is a joy as well to read him in his articulation of what the Psalms are. In dealing with the Hebrew text of the Psalms, he takes great care in maintaining the Hebrew meaning, looking at it grammatically and taking into his analysis the consonants of the Masoretic text. To him, ""Scripture may not be comprehended theologically unless it is first understood grammatically."""
3,an enjoyable series,"This will never be a fantasy classic, it will however be enjoyed by many and appreciated by all who read it. If you are thinking about reading this book then you have probably read the dragonlance series if you enjoyed that you will enjoy this. It really is that simple."
4,It is better the first one and getters better as you read.,"With this second book, several new twists in the plot arrive. We meet several new characters, some of which are friends, some of which are enemies. However, Joram's band of Mosiah, Saryon and Simkin (Who reminds me of some irresistable kender!) travel to Merlion where Joram attempts to reclaim his family property. Joram falls in love, with a lady, who returns his affection, enough to follow him to what many would believe his death. Saryon as well finds himself being trapped by the wretched Bishop Vanya"
4,Almost good,"Great condition, except for the page with a rather large chunk missing from it. Not a huge deal, however, and I am satisfied for the price."
5,one of the best!,"of all the books ive read i dont think any one of them was as neat as doom of the darksword.as Simkin puts it in one of the books ""saved by the love of a girl.betrayed by the love of a wretched, bald catalyst.& delivered into the chubby hands of biship Vanya."" i never knew Simkin was immortal until i read adventures.this book is a must-read for any Weis/Hickman fan."
4,Very solid writing from accomplished writers.,"I have enjoyed Weiss and Hickman books for a number of years and this series does not disappoint. Although it appears to be fairly predictable, there are some nice twists and characters that make this a thoroughly enjoyable (albeit not heavy) read."
4,Doom of the Darksword,This creation by Tracy Hickman takes a very unexpected turn that is extreme and thought provoking. Her characters are well defined and fit the plot well. You won't be disappointed. Keep in mind it is written for young readers and is not complex.
5,Outstanding,I can't even begin to explain how great this book is. It is a terrific sequel to the first in the Darksword series. Without saying to much Joram comes out from under his illusion of having magic and he fulfils the first half of the Prophecy. A must read. I would recomend this book to anyone.
3,The low point in a fine trilogy,"This book isn't anything special but it isn't a drag either. The plot is advanced somewhat but the main service it performs is to make a bridge between the opening of the series and the finale. If it were a stand-alone, I would mildly recommend it - as part of a very good trilogy, it's a must read."
2,Did not like this.,I purchased this as a gift for my daughter and was disapointed in the quality of the blue topaz. They look dirty or something. I went with the all blue topaz one that amazon sells and was quite impressed that for less money I ended up with a nicer necklace.
3,Wife's Christmas Pendant,Good value for the price. Smaller than what I thought it would be. The chain is incredibly frail and will most likely snag on something and break within the next three months.
1,the product was fine,"the only problem I had was that acdelco had come out with a new version of the filter, I ended giving these to a friend as the new filters eliminated a problem with check engine lights on my 2007 chevy diesel"
5,FANTASTIC RESOURCE!,"This book is a fantastic resource for anyone interested in Musical Theatre. I use it to find solos, duets and ensemble musical theatre pieces for my students. Each song is listed by voice type and by show. In addition, the vocal range is included next to each song. This is the best [money] I've spent this year!"
3,Mixed menu,"A thoughtful little book. Vivid passages of 1941 Soviet history are mixed in with something resembling magic realism, describing, variously, life as viewed backwards from a New York apartment, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, sumptuous meals of the past, the sneaky munching of rice grains by our hungry hero, his willful affairs, and the slow painful death by starvation of his beloved wife. A Sunday afternoon absorbing read, spoiled a little by some irritating typographical errors -- naughty, naughty proofreader!"
2,packaging,I like all these films but why are you putting wolf in the set instead of the wolf man with Anthony Hopkins.
1,Simply disappointing,"The author claims to be expert in combat blades. Having read his book, I must doubt this claim. I think his neither understands much of knifes nor of knive fighting. Beside some useful hints and stories that you may also find in other books on the subject, the all over impression of this book is disappointing. Trying to sell replicas of antique swords - such as the gladius or the rapier - as modern means of self defense is simply ridiculous. This is the 21st century and not the age of Spartacus or D'Artagnan! Moreover his evaluation criteria for the blades are very inconsistant and vary in the different chapters of the book. The book is full of statements (for example: the western art of fencing is superior to asian traditions) that seem to be subjective judgements. The author would have done well in using scrutinized facts instead. If you are interested in bying a good guide on combat blades you should rather try 'Battle blades' by Greg Walker."
3,Inferior to the same shoe purchased one year ago.,I find these work shoes to be just adequate. The lacing system was much better in the same shoe last year as all connections were eyelets. I am not going to purchase another pair at any point and may switch to Red Wing.
5,Excelente compra,"Muy buena compra, los zapatos cumplieron con las expectativas creadas que se mostraron en la página donde se los mostraba; son cómodos para caminar y usarlos a diario."
1,Pain in the....,"I owned a pair of Timberland Pitboss boots before these that have lasted me 4 years and when it was time to retire them I figure Timberland was a great brand so I picked up these at a local store for around 90 dollars.... what a waste . They started out stiff like most new shoes but after wearing them for 3 months I started developing a sharp pain in my right heel, I have tried several different inserts and even the special heel pain inserts and none of them helped so I brought my old pitboss boots out of retirement and a week later viola! pain gone! Wore these 1 day the next week and BAM pain is back in full force. I tell everyone I know to stay away from these shoes and pray they haven't caused permanent damage to my foot.P.S. I work 40+ hours a week in an auto dealer shop on a concrete floorIf you want good work boots get these [...]"
3,Solid but confortable shoes.....,Solid but confortable shoes for every day use @ work. Fully recommended---Ha... gonna purchase a pair more. different model of course......
3,Chabrol on middling form,"Rien Ne Va Plus/The Swindle is another minor late Chabrol effort that spends too long treading water and which lacks the lightness of touch to really pull off the caper movie it wants to be. The first hour is flat, with Isabelle Huppert unconvincing as a conwoman you couldn't imagine fooling a deaf, dumb and blind man while Michel Serrault has little to work with as her partner in crime. But once the twists kick in in the last 40 minutes, it does pick up even if it never surprises, and at least the scenery is nice."
5,Fits and works great,I put this blade mount onto my 2006 Honda Rancher 4x4 fourwheeler. It fit great and went on real easy. I put it on within 20 min.
2,"Uncomfortable, can't breathe!","I have to give it another try, but i found it an uncomfortable fit. after five minutes you have to rip it off to breathe. i have an average size head but the strings are too tight. it did help with the smell of the paint, but not completely. i will try when i am painting again, outside, and this time furniture. everyone is different and the product it self is made so well and so reasonably priced. i am not sorry i bought them and will try to review again. as always fast shipment."
5,"Clear sound, crystal clear","Love these speakers! The wires are a little short, so expect to spend about $15 more at Radio Shack buying RCA wire extensions - anyone can figure out how to add these onto the wires.Since these speakers plug directly into your computer, MAKE SURE that you have a ""sound card"" with 3 outs (generally ""Speak 1"", ""Speak 2"", and ""sub"" or ""center"" or ""Speak 3""). Without this, you can either:1) buy a 3-to-1 3.5mm adapter and plug all the wires into your 1 output - this will make all speakers output the same sound, thoughor2) buy a USB external 5.1 sound card - works very nicelyor3) buy a sound card for your desktop - if you know what this means, I don't need to explain. But if you are not a computer person, chose 2) preferably, or 1).Sound is very clear, though, no problems at all. Base is very loud, and travels FAR, especially in dorm rooms :) I actually leave my base all the way down, and I am one of ""those"" people that just love lots of base."
4,Speaker Review,"These speakers are great! The sound quality is pretty good. The only thing that i wasn't too pleased with was the ""installation"" part. It came with a connector thingy for the extra speakers but they don't really work that well. Other than that, this is a very good purchase."
3,Logitech X-530 5.1 Speaker System,"I had purchase this product before and it serves it's purpose, but I notice the adapter that came with the previous system allowed me to hook up my red and white audio plugs, but this recently purchase system did not. Also, I have to jiggle the wires to make some of the speakers works."
2,Product must have been refurbished,"The product itself might have been good. I had a previous set that lasted me forever until I gave it away after I traveled last year. Honestly, I thought the system would have lasted a bit longer. It seems that the item might have been refurbished or repaired by some lousy technicians. Within 45 days or so, I lost the money I spent purchasing that trash. The Sub-woofer completely stopped functioning. I unplugged it immediately thinking it might have been overheated but ever since it never works again. I paid another 15 dollars to get it looked at but it was not worth the repair they told me.I got ripped off. I guess the bad economy explains why cheap items are sold online to to make a quick buck.Be wise, Amazon shoppers"
5,Terrific Sounding System,"When I ordered these for my video editing computer, I really wasn't expecting a whole lot. I was wrong. These speaker give exceptional sound for their size (and often better than larger speaker systems).Super easy to set up, especially if your 5.1 surround sound audio card is color coded and if not, just follow the simple directions that come with the speakers. As my husband said, adding these to our system was a 'no-brainer' - just plug them in.I have also hooked these up on my Vaio laptop and once again the sound is fantastic. If you're in the market for 5.1 surround speakers for your system - you can not go wrong with this set from Logitech."
4,Great Speakers at this price,"I was thinking about getting the Z-5500 Speakers, but thought I would give these a try since they were about 1/5th the price. Excellent decision, as these speakers sound great...even paired with my old Sound Blaster 2 AUDIGY. I have my own house and like to crank the volume on movies, games and music (I love Christie True!) as loud as I can take it. Even at 3/4, these things are too loud to handle unless I am drunk or worse. No distortion, the Bass sounds great even at high volumes.This is the first review I have ever written on anything. I felt obliged since these speakers worked out so nicely."
2,Strong Bass But Bad Trebble and Muddy Sound,"Well, I bought this product because I read the good reviews from other amazon shoppers. I was a bit disappointed by the sound delivered by this system. I use them to listen to MP3 music on the net and that does not work well. The bass is strong and tight at low volume but becomes very loose when it is cranked up. The trebble is never good. I used the MS media player equalizers to adjust but that did not improve the clarity of sound. If you use this system to play video games (which I did not), you may find these speakers do a good job. But using them to listen to online music is whole different story."
4,"Excellent for the price, but there is one thing I don't like...","These speakers really kick-it when you want the volume loud, but there is one thing I don't like: You cannot turn the bass all the way off. I live in an apartment, and if I want to listen to music at night I can't turn it up very loud because the bass is louder than the speakers at low volumes. There is a nob on the bass unit, but it will not turn it off completely. I have messed with the sound equalizer and brought the bass down somewhat, but it's just not the same. I do have to say that I would definately buy these at this price though. There is a lot of speaker here..."
3,sound is good...but,"the bass is TOO heavy. powerful bass, in comparison to the other frequencies. so i have to adjust my equalizer and keep the sub-woofer knob at a minimum level. you'll also need a phono out splitter or two if you want to use ALL the speakers. don't know how it is on PC's, but on my mac i needed to add a couple of splitters to use all the speakers."
1,"so, soo",i was looking for home theater not the one u need the sound is not that clear obviously they price was not so expensive so i wasnt gonna get something amazing but this is a PLEASE DO NOT BUY IT
1,gamer beware!,this 5.1 system requires game console adapter in order to hook up with the game console and the game console adapter is NOT INCLUDED! and it is not available for purchase from logitech.com! consider it before you buy it.
2,A 2.1 System sounds better than these,"sound no better than from a $20 boombox. Not the slightest hint of bass, and forget clarity. 2 stars for good looks"
4,Was What was advertised,I think the speakers were great for what I wanted them for... To bad my laptop doesn't have the ability to us all the speakers. Maybe then I'd be able to experience the full power of this product!
5,Great speakers,They are louder than they look. And the subwoofer kicks very nice. I paid $50 for this. What are you waiting for?
5,Excellent,They are excellent.The sound and the price make a good combination.The sound quality is very good. I'm happy with these speakers. I recommend you.
3,Pretty Good,"At first I thought the speakers had no dimension in the mid range. I was straining to find any of the harmonies in selected pieces of music....individual instruments were impossible to define...But after a substantial break-in period, (a few months), I'm much happier with them. These would be ok for a starter set, for anyone who isn't an overly discriminating audiophile, you can at least get a good thump from the powered bass for dancing, and be sure to use software that has an equalizer to maximize your sound quality."
3,speaker sistem,"the speakers works good after putting together,a few days later two speakers don't work.the sounds is poor.the system looks good on my leaving room.but once again two are damage"
4,Satisfied with the sound quality but...,"I got these speakers a few hours back and they are amazing... I really love them... The only problem that they have:1- The wire for the rear speakers are short even for my small room!!!2- It did not include the stereo cable connection from my computer to the adaptor (I had to get that separately!!!)Beside these, they are really good for the money that you pay... strongly recommend them if you are looking for a 5.1 system and don't want to spend hundreds on the receiver and the suround systems...."
4,Good if you know how to adjust it.,"These speakers are pretty good for under $50. It was very simple to set up. I first tested it on my computer playing some songs from my media player and I noticed that the bass was pretty loud, even after I turned it all the way down. The sound card I am using is a Diamond XtremeSound 7.1/24 bit, it comes with a program that you can use to adjust your audio settings for Rock, Bass, Trebble, Live, or whatever you like. It works great with some of settings, especially trebble because even with the bass turned all the way up, you don't get that rattle sound that's been giving some people problems. So if you only installed sound drivers without the additional software to adjust your audio configuration, the subwoofer will really bother you. I give it 4 stars because I like the wall mounting, the wires are pretty long. Even though you can find better quality speakers, these are good for around $50."
5,Glad I bought it!,We used this for my younger brother's dance & the sound was awesome. I am really happy w/ the results.
4,good,"They are good. I like the way the connections are made. Unlike other hometheater systems, each speaker connection is made with jacks and labelled them so that the connection for each speaker goes in its allocated socket which produces clarity in the sound and avoids frequency variations. Once again it is worth for the price"
4,Connecting to a PS/2,I have recently purchased the X-530 speakers with a view to hooking it up to a Playstation 2. However the all important Console Adaptor is sold seperately (available to buy online from logitech). The manufacturers blurb on Amazon does state this with an asterisk but it should also mention that you can only get stereo sound when connecting directly to a PS/2 as opposed to full 5.1 surround. There are ways and means I believe to get 5.1 from a PS/2 but I would recommend going for a Logitech 2.1 speaker offering instead. Having said that the sound is outstanding for the price and size.
2,"WAY to much bass, also the sound quality is crappy","There are some nice aspects about these speakers, such as the 70 watts and the ability to be wall-mounted. The sound quality sucks. These speakers are hooked up to a Sound Blaster Audigy 2 and they still sound bad! 65% of my complaint of sound quality is the bass. It's ""boomy"", there's too much of it, and it's too loud, even at its lowest setting! If you live in an apartment and are concerned about noise, don't buy these!"
5,Speaker system,I got this speaker system for a computer. It was easy to install and sounds great. The price was reasonable. When we changed the setting on the computer for the new speakers it did not take effect until the computer was restarted. Great sound for the money.. If you are into the music or gaming this is for you.
5,GREAT!,"I got these speakers a few weeks ago. The sound that comes off of them is worth more then they cost. Usually with speakers you get what you pay for, and make no mistake the sound isnt comparable to a $500 set of 5.1 speakers but it is comparable to a $250 pair of speakers so these are a great value. Plugged them into my new X-fi soundcard and the sound was 100x better than my old 2.1 speakers with a SB Live! 5.1 card. I would highly recomend these speakers to someone on a budget who won't settle for budget-sound."
4,Almost perfect,"If these speaker rendered sound to all 6 speaker when playing a DVD or CD I'd have given them 5 stars.But since the don't ,I won't.However i understand they will if you get an adapter from radio shack or logitech they have the ability to do so.Haven't done so yet but I will say for the money they sound awesome.All in all,I recommend them to anyone wanting the best sound for a small amount of money.THE SOUND AND AIR VOLUME COMING THE SUB WOOFER DURING GAMEPLAY IS ESPECIALLY IMPRESSIVE. ENJOY!"
4,Decent at low to medium volumes.,"These can't handle turning it up more than 50-60% without distortion.. but at lower volumes, enough for a medium sized room, they sound fantastic and are a good value for the money."
5,Wonderful System!,"I gave this system to my husband for his birthday and he absolutely loves it! He uses it both for gaming and tv/movies and it sounds great, and projects clear sound even when its turned clear up! We are extremely happy with it!"
4,Quality speakers for good price,"These are real good sounding speakers. I wish there was some way to turn of the sub so at night I wouldn't have to worry about waking people up, but for the price you can't get really any better."
5,Great Sound and a Great Price,The X-530 Speaker System is great. I was impressed with the great sound quality from these speakers powered by my SoundBlaster Audigy 2 card. Setting up the speakers was a snap and I had everything I needed right out of the box.
1,"Great Sounding Speakers, But...","Don't get me wrong, when I bought this set of speakers they were absolutely wonderful. Best sounding speakers I've ever owned for my PC.Problem was, I had a power surge at my house and the fuse blew. So, I got a hold of Logitech about where I can get them serviced, and you know what they told me? ""This is one of our only speaker systems without a fuse. The whole board is blown and there's nothing you can do about it."" They basically told me to suck it up and buy another set from them. So, don't expect any repairs if something goes wrong, there is NO maintenance that can be done with these speakers.Just thought you all should hear the downside to this wonderful package before you buy it."
1,SUCKS,"They sound great at first...... crank up the music, they were BLOWN? Not what they appear to be. Don't be fooled!I wellcome Logitech to contact me..........................!!!DaveLogitech X-540 5.1 Speaker System"
5,Great system! What a steal!,"I was looking for the perfect gift for a friend at a low price, and this was it! Has incredible sound, even better than some of the $100+ systems I've had before. And, not to mention, the gift receiver's eyes lit up at the set... He still thinks I payed a lot for it!"
5,Great if you have a good sound card.,"I got these speakers for my laptop, but was dissappointed when I found out I couldnt use all of the speakers because of my crappy notebook soundcard. However, even with only two speakers connected the sound was lound and clear. The sub-woofer is great, the only problem is that the satellite speakers have a flimsy base, so they tend to fall at times..."
1,A dim bulb!,"Not a replacement for a flourescent bulb! the advertised savings aren't really there with these bulbs. I bought some and was disappointed when they didn't give the same amount of light as a $.99 nite light. I cannot even read by their light, these bulbs are so dim! I love the idea of these things, and I'll have to see what products are out there which can outlast flourescent bulbs."
1,Do Not Purchase,"These lights are extremely dim and the light is more of a focused beam than a broad coverage. Although that is not a huge let down. I purchased four for my room. While being satisfied at first, when turning the lights back on ten minutes after putting the lights in, one failed and has yet to come back on. I paid fifteen dollars for ten minutes of light. So be very careful when purchasing these LED lights; they are not quality products."
1,big waste of money,"You can make something like this yourself with a higher output and lower cost. for almost $50, it's well worth your time.It's a nice novelty item but puts out as much light as a 20-watt bulb.I would avoid this puppy altogether if you're looking to replace any standard lighting."
3,SmartDisk 120V 36 LED LIGHT BULB ( 97314A ),Not as bright as I had expected from LED lights. This is kind of like those cheap city street lamps. I really was hoping for something brighter.
1,Useless...Does not replace anything!,"Please avoid this bulb at all costs. C.Crane makes outlandish claims about this bulb that are simply false. This bulb does not give off enough light to replace any type of bulb whatsoever! You cannot use this for reading or activities. It is a very expensive, and a complete rip off."
2,At least the power consumption is low,"Bought this because it promised to turn any light into a low consumption light. Achieved. Didn't mention I would have to use a flashlight or candle as backup to actually read on paper.Ups:I ended up changing a very dim 11 watt CFL which drew 8 watts and illuminates exactly the same, but now I only use 2 watts (according to my kill-a-watt). It's a conversation maker, sometimes people ask about that odd bulb on the lamp. No glass helps prevent breakage.Downs:Way too dim, the power I save doesn't compensate for the price (or at least not in the near future, maybe my grandchildren will see the break-even point happen?).In general, after reading the other reviews wasn't surprised, the description is somewhat misleading. Would recommend to stick to CFL's if you want to be eco-friendly and wallet-friendly at the same time."
2,Dissapointing,"For people looking to save power this may be for you, but if you are expecting bright light or even distribution of the light this is NOT the LED bulb for you."
3,are we there yet?,This bulb is better than most of the other LEDs that I purchased but still can use some more POWER when it comes to finding those small objects that you accidentally dropped on the floor and cant really seem to find.... dah? where's my trusty flashlight. I rated it 3 stars and I am pretty stingy after spending big bucks for this. My other pet peeve is the UNAVAILABILITY OF DIRECT MAILING TO PUERTO RICO. Hey we pay taxes here too!!!! Come on people! A light bulb!!! and I cant get it mailed to Puerto Rico. JEEEZZZ!
3,About what I expected,"After reading the 2 previous reviews I wasn't expecting much light output from the bulb, so I wasn't really disappointed. The light output is about that of the coleman battery powered camping lanterns, which is to say not bright but ""bright enough"" when you really need light. While it is somewhat dispersed the light mostly seems to shine more or less straight out the top of the bulb, and so would make an excellent choice for a directed reading lamp. I will use it in my bedside table lamp since I really only need to see well enough to get dressed in the morning. You'd probably need 2 or 3 such bulbs to adequately light a small room such as a bathroom if it is going to be your main lighting source and not just an accent light. While perfect for ""off grid"" homes where extreme measures of conserving energy are crucial, the price would have to come down to make sense for most of you."
3,Not very bright,"I got this for christmas. I thought to put it in my lamp in my room, but it is not bright enough for that. I'd say it is about like a 40 watt bulb, except that it doesn't shine all over the place, just in front of itself. It's probably best for places you want a weird dim light on all the time. For that application, I would say this is the perfect bulb."
1,Does NOT meet product description,The product description says this light could be used for reading. Not even close. Doesn't give off much more light than a nite light.Will shed some light on the corner of a room if you are afraid of the dark.
3,Mediocre,"This bulb uses the approach of ""cram many small LEDs in a bulb"" to get as much light as they can muster. It is not bright enough for room lighting but good for: desk; refrigerator; or a very bright night light. It could also be used to light the bathroom at night without bothering your eyes. I would not use it as a reading light.Pros:* Beautiful light; may be compared to about 10-15 watts regular light* LED; no toxic mercury like fluorescent bulbs* Very efficient; more so than fluorescentsCons:* Over priced* Not very bright* Not good for replacing regular bulbsAdditional Information:I like LED lights, but a better way to get brightness is the use of high power 1 watt LEDs. Bulbs based on the 1 watt LEDs generate much more light and are better for lighting whole rooms. Unfortunately I have not found any on Amazon. They are available online however."
1,low light output,"Some of the other reviewers say this bulb puts out about as much light as a 20 watt incandescent equivalent. I don't think it even reaches that. I bought this bulb some time ago and used it in a small office lamp. while it might be adequate for night time reading, I think that's about as good as it gets. It certainly isn't enough to replace a standard household light (eg: 60 watt bulbs). I stopped using it as it simply wasn't bright enough, but for the short time I used it, it worked. Though now I'm a little concerned about it's build considering the complaints about the bulb failing after so short a time. I will have to plug it back in and see if I can replicate the other user's claims."
4,Freezer Light,"Works well for my freezer. It's a bit strangely shaped, it fits rather tightly against the freezer back wall. Certainly not bright enough for much else. I bought it for my freezer though."
2,NOT VERY BRIGHT,JUST AN OVER PRICED SLIGHTLY BRIGHTER THEN NORMAL NIGHT LITE. MY 2-LEDPOCKET LIGHT IS BRIGHTER.
3,Not as bright as you would think,"I bought this bulb to replace the one in an overhead fan since the CFL bulbs are too long for the globe. It fits fine but there is nowhere near the light output of a regular 14-watt CFL or standard 60-watt bulb. My guess is this has the output of a 15-watt regular bulb, not much more. It is now used as a night light in my living room and gives the appearance of the TV being on; similar to what you would encounter in the nocturnal animal display at the zoo. It has an ""interesting"" type of light output but I don't think the price warrants the purchase; I paid about 15 times what a regular 60-watt bulb would cost for this item."
2,Why your life sucks by Alan Cohen,"It is one of the best books I have read of Alan Cohen. In a very simple manner, it explains step by step, how to live our life 100% in each and every moment.I recommend this book for all the people who truly wants to change their lives and remember who they truly are.Rae Chandran,Japan"
5,Out of the spin cycle and into life fully!,"Why your life sucks took me out of the spin cycle of life and moved me toward my life with joy, acceptance and clarity. Alan shares stories, basic truths and my favorite quote in the book ""Reality is for people who can't handle imagination."" Why your Life Sucks is an easy read and gives basic tools and principles to create a life worth living!Much Appreciation!"
5,Like talking to a therapist.......,This book is a keeper! I checked it out from the library a few times because it's filled with soooooo much useful and insightful information. It's time to purchase it!I highly recommend it!
1,A Room With A View,"A room with a view is what the reader needs after reading this mind candy. You will see clearer out a window rather than spend your money on this dopey book. First, the title is an insult and second there is no proscriptive measures that are meaningful that the reader can use. This book is silly!"
1,Disappointing,"The premise of the book is that we all have a life that sucks is really over thee top. I suppose when you are an author your life is swell,especially if you want to sell books. Hahahha It amazes me that cut-you-down and build-you-up books like this even get published any more. I had hoped for an entertaining read, but instead I got something banal. Sad writing for a sorry idea!"
1,Insulting,"After reading a few chapters of this book I felt insulted. Everyone I guess has bad and good days, but to say that my whole life sucks is just too much. This is very negative book that offers few positive moments. I am sorry I spent my money on this less than friendly book."
1,Insulting,"This book is for morons. It is a real reductionistic approach to life. If I were the author, I'd be ashamed of myself and my lack of integrity at writing such a shallow simplistic point of view about life."
2,The sign of a master,We love it! Alan continues to make us laugh and wake us up at the same time. The sign of a master!
1,One of the worst self-help books I ever read,"I read a lot of self-help books, and after reading the unanimously positive reviews here I was really looking forward to diving into this one. What a disappointment! This book is a never-ending collection of platitudes. The author's advice could be summarized like this: just think positively, and all your problems will go away. For example: (Page 49)""When I vacationed in Bali, I lost 10 pounds in two weeks. I wasn't even trying to lose weight. I went to banquets and ate rich desserts. Why did I lose weight? I was having such a good time that when I lightened up emotionally, I lightened up physically."" Yeah, right..."
5,Inspiring,"I Love his booksI like the dragón doesn't live here anymoreI really recomend all his books , especially that one"
3,Useful but not spectacular,"There are lots of good piece of wisdom in Alan Cohen's book Why your Life Sucks? The author gives us ten reason's and then explains how each one undermines us. Some parts of the book are a little hokey and new agey, but overall a worthwile read."
1,Mother of two,"Do not waste your money, could not install this game, we try in two computers, Compaq and Dell, both with Windows, with no success, and since we have to open the software trying install it now we can not return and get our money back."
2,Reading rabbit,"Not sure just how good of a product this is as it would not run well on Windows 7. The big problem is the support or lack there of. When I called the producer of the product listed on the package, they claimed they were only the distributor. The people they sent we to said they were only a distributor as well and sent me back to the first party so on and so on. So to this date, I am unable to run the product."
5,"Lightweight, Comfortable and Awesome for recreational activities","i originally bought these for paintball (woodsball), because they are so lightweight, agile, comfy, and flexible. Great for run and gunner speedball scenario games too, and if you dont play paintball, these shoes are good for what ever, good long lasting New Balance shoes won't let you down, even if you are a large and in charge person LOL"
1,Worst movie I've seen in years,Don't waste your money- this movie was terrible!! I saw this through Netflix and was extremely disappointed. I couldn't watch it more than the first 20 minutes. Acting was ok- but the writing is terrible and it looks like a student film. If you like Philip Winchester- watch Crusoe instead!!
3,Good not great.,"The book relies too much on anecdotes. The anecdotes over simplify the complex topic of leadership. The book starts slow, and because of the over reliance of anecdotes, the book progresses slowly. The positive aspects of the book is that it is not an attribute based leadership book. The authors focus on authentic leadership and recognize that there are multiple styles.Overall it is a good book and I am glad that I read it."
3,Uniformity,"I ordered one of these (shirts) in a size medium and I think it was a med.. I ordered two more, at different times and got one small and one large, both marked medium, open cuffs instead of knitted. So I have three sizes, three patterns and one with the knitted cuff like I ordered. I think these are seconds (or thirds?) and the colors and styles are random! The pants are okay except one pair is small. (Also random colors)"
3,Not what I thought they were,Keep in mind that these are basically long-underwear. I bought these expecting them to be a heavier material to wear as outer cover during dove season when it's warm... didn't work.What is the point of having camo long-underwear??? Heck if I know...
3,"Wash it first, maybe?","Right out of the package, it wasn't very absorbent. I and my daughter had problems with it cleaning out condensation inside. I kept trying to get it to clean, but it left beads of moisture in there. It may do better after its been washed and free of any chemicals that might have been on it (think new clothes smell). Another flute player I know uses a cloth that's similar to what you'd use to clean your jewelry, so I may try that route."
4,cleaning clothe,I got these for my grand child and she uses them to clean her flute and they seem to do a good job.
5,Power Woodworking Tools,"I think this is an excellant book for someone who wishes to know if woodworking is for him/her. I have purchased several more specific books , such as routers and their applications, but this book (which was a birthday present), provides a broad overview for someone who wants to know the basics of a tool which will be enough to get him/her started. . . If only Amazon.com would bring the price down, I would send it to friends & family. . . In my dreams. . ."
5,Always good books,"This books gives a good overview of power tools and provide some useful hints even for experts. At a $1 plus shipping, it is well worth it."
2,Important information missing...,"While I enjoy the lighthearted style of any ""For Dummies"" book, perhaps a book focusing on two of the most frustrating topics for small business owners - computers and accounting - might want to concentrate more on useful content, and minimize the space used up by cutesy comments.I was disappointed with the lack of information on using classes, and customizing billing items and invoice forms.I use several Intuit products: QuickBooks, Quicken, and QuickTax. The software is generally very good, but it does have it's limitations in ""customizability"" for special accounting/ bookkkeeping requirements. I had hoped that I might also get some helpful workarounds in those areas from this book. I didn't -- and am now looking to other QB authors in the hope of finding that ""not-necessarily-power-user"" information. Perhaps the 2002 version will cover different issues."
2,Not Recommended,"I am disappointed with this book. The author does not get to the important points, but distracts the readers with unnecessary details. He started off some sections by introducing two methods, recommends one of them and says that he will talk about the other one. But he never did.Unless you have not used a computer for the last few years, you will not learn much from this book."
1,Cheap products at ripoff postal rates.............................,"If you want a cheap version of a Beatle keychain and want to pay over $4 to have it shipped to you, then this is your place to shop! If you want to get e-mails that say something like...""it really doesn't matter to me in the end because I have your money so I am not going to lose any sleep over this....""Spend your money some place else folks.........."
2,"if you already tinker, look elsewhere for insights","I am not a professional repairer, but I have attempted repairs on quite a few household items over the years--some I have been successful at and some not. This book is not of particular value to me as the instruction it provides just seems to be limited to the obvious and simplest types of repair with the frustrating advice to not attempt a repair on some products yourself, but take them to a professional."
2,Misleading photo,"It's a good size and hefty material, but it does not have the gold plated look of the photo. It's a dull plastic color and looks very fake. You get what you pay for."
5,informative,Packed full of info in a fun and interesting way. I learned a lot myself! My 5 yr old loves this kit.
5,Great Time,"My kids (all 3 of them) had a great time with this kit. They love the magic school bus books and show. This kit made the book come alive for them. They had so much fun. The huge poster and sticks were really interesting and the experiments kept their attention for hours (not the easiest thing to do with three boys especially at their ages, 6-11 years old!!!!). I would defiantly recommend this product for your own children or as gifts (that is what I am doing this year. I have a pair of nieces that will love this kit!!!)."
5,Works as advertised - couldn't be happier,"We bought a set of these to use to control the pump for our home water heater -- works great, we have it installed in all our bathrooms. Whenever anyone needs hot water, rather than waste water, we just turn on the hot water pump using the wireless transmitter, and a few seconds later we have hot water. Turning it off after the warm water arrives has saved a lot of energy."
4,Works like a charm,Bought this to add to an existing setup. I've already got one of this switches by the bedroom door to control the lamps. Just needed a second switch to go by the bed. Just match up the dial settings and it was off and working.The battery it came with was dead. Keep in mind this uses a special 12V battery that looks like a stunted AAA battery. They're about $4 at an electronics store. The battery tray isn't well built so the battery has a tendency to fall out whenever you remove the baseplate from the faceplate.
4,Product works well only one small issue.. It's huge,"The products works very well and offers multiple channel use. I'm very happy with it and it seems to work from long distances. However, it's big. Make sure you're looking for a remote this size."
1,doesn't work,i installed it in a hanging light and only works until the fixture has been on for a few minutes. after the remote gets hot it will no longer turn off. have to unscrew the bulb and let it cool down!!! don't know how to get my money back or who to call?
2,Not good if you are fat,"I tried this money belt on when it arrived. I had to make it as large as possible in order to fit my waist. It has this sort of clip to keep it on. I was afraid that I would bust the clip and that it would fall off of me while I was wearing it, so I ended up not using it. I think it would be fine for thinner women, however. (my waist is probably about 35 inches or so)"
2,Didn't last the full ten days,"Nice fit, but it didn't make it through my ten-day trip to Europe. I had to borrow my daughter's bulkier one to finish."
2,Too soft,"The fabric is very comfortable, but entirely too much like lingerie--rolls up on my body. I wound up not using it on the trip because of this."
1,"Lightweight and easily concealed, but broke the zipper broke the first night I wore it","Lightweight and easily concealed, but broke the zipper broke the first night I wore it. Wish it was durable bc I really liked it before it broke!"
2,Broken By Day 2!!,"I read the other reviews of this product and bought it despite some reviewers' warnings. I wish I had heeded them... I am *gentle* with items that I own and strove to be particularly gentle with this money belt because it was indeed made of very thin material. It did feel great to wear and was very inconspicuous under my clothing for the two days I got to use it. On the second day as I was closing the pouch, the zipper came entirely off the track. No amount of fiddling could coax it back on the track without it coming right off again! All of my $$ and passport were stuck inside, so unfortunately I had to rip through the seam to obtain my belongings. This product, while enticing, is NOT worth the money or hassle."
4,Soft Lightweight Money Belt,"This money belt is very soft and will be perfect for traveling abroad to keep valuable stuff in close at hand. Cute little inside pocket,too. Somewhat concerned with the warning sticker about how it can cause cancer according to California standards, but it's probably just a slight risk for what they spray on it to make the fabric soft (California standards are extremely tight, aren't they? I don't know, I don't live there.) Otherwise, this is just what I was looking for."
2,Travel money belt,"Thie money belt arrived with a hazard warning of a cancer risk. I have been told that the State of Calif requires such warnings on items not made of organic materials. Consequently, the recipient of the gift was afraid to use it. As far as I know, the design was fine. I have requested that the money belt be forwarded to me so I can see what materials provoked such a warning. Consumers need to expect this warning before purchasing the belt as it is quite alarming."
2,Feels like nothing on but rips within hours,"I got this for travel to Africa and picked this one because I am petite and didn't want anything too bulky. After wearing it for only 2 hours with only my passport inside, I noticed the fabric had ripped in one corner. It wasn't enough for my passport to fall out, but I wouldn't be able to hold smaller items like keys, loose bills or change. Very disappointing, especially because the fabric is soft and the size just right for a passport."
2,Bad surprise,I didn't like finding out after I bought the item that the State of California rates its construction materials carcinogenic. Otherwise the item was as described
5,strut your stuff,"i wont be verbose. true music is artistic expression. It can be heard and fealt as what its really suppose to be here. Even if you dont like the wide span of musical genres covered,Susaye is a force to be reckoned with. You do the thing, gurl!!!!!!!!"
5,secrets of the unknown Big foot,The video was very educational. It kept you interested till the end. It was made for people who believe and do not believe in the possibility of their excistense. Excellent video for your first look at the Big Foot.
1,Misery Science Theater 3000,"This biased, overstylized program spends more time showing host Edward Mulhare than it does showing Sasquatch. Bigfoot newcomers will snicker at the montages of a guy parading around in a shaggy ape costume, while veterans will learn absolutely nothing new about the legendary creature. The show reaches its nadir with the muttered testimonials of several Ignorant White Males, who seem to comprise the majority of all eyewitnesses. At the conclusion of this 20-minute video, Mulhare takes Bigfoot's existence as a given, but viewers over the age of four may question his judgment."
5,CD box set,Fantastic condition. I got this for my mom for her birthday and she was so happy. The cds came in alloted time and I was able to get them to her just in time.
4,Great Set,"Great set! The other reviewer, Bud, has no idea what he's talking about. Since when does a singer have to actually write songs in order to express emotion or to tap into a raw power that someone else has written? You don't have to invent the wheel to know how to drive the car.This is a great re-mastered set for those wanting a clear and pristine sound along with some previously unreleased material. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it has no great booklet with pictures and more history to go with it. Janis Rocks On!"
5,Remastered and sounds great. A must for Janis fans.,Also has some never before released songs. They are very interesting. I feel luck that a I got to see her live. She was unbelievable.
5,Janis Joplin,"This box set was great, exactly JJ that I had been looking for. A good all around example of the Pearls music."
4,It's clear why my friend claims Janis as her Queen,"Though, if my friend hadn't suggested I buy this collection of records, it is a sign, we don't always know what it is we are looking for. Lucky for me, the breatth of this angel was blown into my ear."
5,A Must Have!!!,"I have used this book TOO MANY TIMES over the past 10 years! Obviously, I would have preferred not to deal with layoffs and reorgs, but each time I was faced with those situations, the DGRG was there to help. Every time I submitted a resume, I was complemented not only on the content, but also the structure of the resume. I have only Yana Parker to thank for the techniques I learned from her book. Thanks to her and the DGRG, I'm finally have my dream job at Apple Computer, Inc. today..."
1,Caution!,"Even though incandescent lighting is becoming scarce, this item can only be used with incandescent lights. Unfortunately the description leaves out this important detail."
2,poor reception and no cfl use,"I have all of my exterior lighting on remote control. I use CFL bulbs in most of the fixtures. THIS SWITCH WILL NOT WORK WITH CFL. So I wired it to the circuit that I use spot bulbs in and installed it in a plastic box so as not to degrade the signal. At 10 feet my remote would not operate. At 5 feet I had a 50!% chance and holding my remote to the switch it worked most of the time. I removed the switch from the box and it worked out to about 30 feet. Bottom line, it needs a better antenna or to be exposed. But as your probably aware, having a switch dangling by wires is not ideal or sometimes legal."
5,One of my favorite JavaScript books,"I've bought almost every JavaScript book on the market (and I've also co-authored one: ""Plug-n-Play JavaScript""). This is definitely one of the best unless you are looking for an advanced level book. This book is ideal for someone who knows the basics already but is looking to learn a little more. It's one of the few books that covers all of the most important basic concepts in JavaScript (eg. using variables, strings, loops, arrays, operators, expressions, timers, etc.) without giving you fluff. It gives you the basic building blocks to you need to get into JavaScript in a productive way. Very easy to follow and understand. I also recommend Danny Goodman's JavaScript Bible (more advanced) or the O'Reilly JavaScript book (more of a reference, but indispensable). I wish I could recommend my book but it is hopelessly outdated..."
4,Good Simple Reference For Javascript,"I like this book as I have a good handle on Javascript but don't use it everyday. When I need Javascript, it is usually for something common like popping up a new browser window, working with timers, etc. What is nice about this book is that you can find exactly what you are looking for with short explanations that will enable you to solve your problems fast with the proper syntax. I would recommend this book to programmers who occasionally use Javascript and need a quick reference with short and clear examples."
3,Not bad to begin with,"I was trying to do one particular thing with Java and this book met that need quite well. On the whole, it's got some useful examples that can teach you some of the basics. I feel, however, that a lot of space was wasted in trying to oversimply and overdescribe screens where a little more detail would have been appropriate. Having said that, the book is clearly written and the layout is easy to follow. There are better books out there, but this one is certainly not the worst of the bunch."
2,Could have been better...,Finally rented this movie cuz i heard so much about it but I was disappointed. Had a good premise but just didnt go anywhere..Not really scary but had some creepy parts... I say rent first before buying...
1,DO NOT SEE THE MOVIE,"Beside Sorum another Tartan Asia Extreme movie. This is by far one of the worst movie I have ever seen. The movie also has no plot! In another hand if you like to see a movie full of gruesome pictures like a man stabbing himself or like the movie Tomie then this is the right movie for you, but I really think this is a very poor movie! SO save your money and do not buy this movie."
3,it's ok,"this movie's perfect if you saw the ring, found out it was japanese in origin, liked it and want to get into japanese horror. it's not too over the top but it has all the right elements (some wierd sex stuff, sadism, and sick obsessions) if you're already kind of into japanese horror it's the definition of decent. it's a rent not a buy"
2,More Asian Horror That's More Strange Than Scary,The new movie from the director of The Grudge is even more narratively murky than that film and not as creepy.A cameraman who wanders under Tokyo's subways discovers a naked girl and brings her back to his place where she develops a taste for blood...or is that really what happens.This movie plays with our perception with scrambled video footage and does feature some unsettling and bloody scenes.Unfortunately it's all too mysterious for it's own good and you're left scratching your head in the end.Unique but too weird to be satisfying.
4,Strange and sensuous,"'Marebito' is an interesting interesting concept film, original and well-made. A good 90 minutes of entertainment, if you like yours disturbing and gritty.A documentary filmmaker witnesses a man's fairly horrific suicide and goes searching for the nature of terror in the old tunnels beneath Tokyo. There, along with a strange homeless man and a (possible) ghost, he finds a young girl. She is naked, mute, and chained to a wall. He does what anyone might do in such a situation, right? He frees her, takes her home, and keeps her like a pet. It seems to be working out all right, until he finds that the girl has a strong preference for drinking human blood.It's a creepy but sometimes sensuous little movie. I liked it mainly because it doesn't try to overplay anything; it sets an effective tone and sticks to it, and never really shows its hand fully. Lots of good mood-setting and a few gory payoff moments as well, an interesting story and good actors. Not bad at all."
3,I should have read the other reviews first.,"I want to say first that this is a good movie, But my mistake was not reading the previous reviews. I was expecting a horror type movie and this is not what you see here. The main character keeps talking about fear and terror, the film almost seems to be leading up to that fear and terror, so I'm thinking ""this is gonna be gooood!"". well guess what? No fear or terror except that which you have to imagine the characters are seeing and feeling. Don't get me wrong, I always thought horror movies that rely on tricks of making the audience jump in thier seats by showing them something quick and unexpected are nothing more than a cheap way of tricking us into being scared. I always thought true horror is rooted deep in the mind with visuals to complement the story. This movie is all story(a good story)and very little visuals."
5,First Rate Spaghetti Westerns,"I bought this one for A Genius Two Partners And A Dupe, and sure wasn't disappointed! This was well worth the money and all the films looked in good watchable shape for spaghetti westerns. Jus a few minor imperfections but no interfering cropping off of heads or scenes cut at all. Simply a good exciting spaghetti western experience."
3,Helpful reference tool,"Don't take the subtitle lightly: this book is certainly a comprehensive introduction to interpreting scripture. It is very thorough, covering topics from textual criticism, genre of scripture and going from interpretation to application. It is an anthology with close to 30 contributors which means the strength of this volume is going to be its diversity and its depth and breadth of the topics covered. Its one fall-back is that there is quite a bit of overlap between chapters, so if you are trying to read it straight through, get ready to wade through a lot of material and see a lot of overlap. However, If you are looking for a good reference tool on hermeneutics, this is a very helpful volume."
3,Great info...very tough read,"This book has a lot of amazing information inside but very hard to get through...very technical. I am going to use it for a reference book when I need a reminder on issues regarding biblical interpretation but if you are a beginner, do not pick this book up before you pick up ""Living By the Book"" by Howard and William Hendrickson. I would read that book first as it is comprehensive as well, but a much easier first edition to a library than this book.That said, don't skip out on this book as it will give you a lot of very good insight on how to correctly interpret the word of God."
3,Had to purchase it,This item was shipped on time and was in wonderful condition. I had to purchase it for school and it is NOT the most interesting book I have on my shelf.
1,junk,This mixer only worked for about ten seconds and hasn't worked since. I would not recommend this mixer. Its a piece of junk...
1,Not what I expected,"I didn't realize that Theo Klein was a toy label and had to send it back. Likely my ignorance, not the manufacturer's."
4,"Just like Mommy's, but it needs an auto shut off","This was perfect for my three year old son despite the negative reviews. It's a perfect size for him, and he loves that the beaters can be taken off just like ours. The sound isn't too obnoxious, but they should've made an auto shut off so the batteries don't drain."
2,disappointed,I bought this for my 5 year to mix Easy bake oven mixes. It took me awhile to get it working and still can not get beaters to come out. Seems to only have one speed. Wish I could return but past the time limit on Amazon
5,Fantastic Mouse!,"I ordered this mouse three years ago to use with my Dell Inspiron laptop. It works GREAT!! I use it nearly every day, with up to two weeks on a single charge (without turning it off), and I've only changed the batteries once. The recharge cable is wonderful--if it needs to be charged, I simply plug it in and it charges while in use. It was super easy to set up and I've never had to ""re-set it"". It's smaller size fits comfortably in my hand and the joy stick allows for smooth scrolling. Curser control is very good. I would recommend this mouse to anyone for use with a desktop or laptop."
3,The mouse that I DID get is fine,"I ordered what I saw: a blue mouse that looked pretty good. What I ended up getting is a grey Targus mouse that looks bad, but gets the job done. The battery case is terrible and is difficult to maneuver, and you have to spend 2 minutes setting up the bluetooth every time you want to use it, but I only use it occasionally for Photoshop projects on my Macbook Air. For that it is fine, but don't order this mouse if you want to use it more than occasionally, buy something that's a bit more pricey and you won't regret it."
3,"perfect size, but loses connection","I love the feel of this mouse and it set up really easy, but it doesn't work all of the time. It could be an issue with my new HP computer, but many times I go to use it and it doesn't work. If I take out the newly installed batteries or hold it upside down for some reason it'll start working. My business partner has threatened to throw it out the door several times, lol. I hope it doesn't come to that."
4,Great little mouse,"I think this mouse is a great little mouse. It does everything that I want it to do and is easy to use. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that a lot of the time that I have to connect the mouse, I must manually connect it through my bluetooth manager. Sometimes it just connects without hassle though. It could be a fault with my computer. Media function works great and the mouse function works great."
4,Provides essential information on toxemia,"Dr. Brewer's book, Metabolic Toxemia of Late Pregnancy, is a difficult book to read for the non-medical person but it provides essential information on toxemia and how to avoid this potentially deadly disease of pregnancy. It is written by a doctor for a doctor. As a clinician studying over 500 women with toxemia over a 10 year period, he presents convincing proof in the form of case studies, that he understood the disease, how to treat it, and how to prevent it.I would recommend any pregnant woman who is at risk or showing signs of developing toxemia to suggest the book to their doctor."
1,Talking on a music CD,"A terrible set of 2 disks. I rate this worse than 1 star. In the years I have been buying from Amazon, it is the first purchase I have ever returned. Between each song is several minutes of meaningless drivel and gum-flapping blather. There is over 42 minutes of b.s. on these 2 disks. When I buy music disks, I expect to hear music, not clap-trap tripe."
5,This will make you happy....,"This product solved my problem of the string pull switch in our two closets. They were always problems. Switch got tough to pull or the string broke. Grrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!! Now we just push the toggle switch and the light goes on or off. My wife LOVES it. I LOVE it. My friend loved it when he came over to work on a project. He said ""I have got to get one of these so everyone will turn that fan off on the patio before they go to bed"". Enough said...........get one plus the switch that controls it."
1,can not turn light off when it overheats!,"this product should be recalled!I bought two of these and both have the same problem - when light is on for more than 45 minutes, I am unable to switch light off without unscrewing it from the socket. It works fine again once it cools down. I have 75W bulb in one and CF with 100W (tangsten equilvalent) / (23W actual) bulb and both get very hot."
4,Old House No Light Switch,"I have an old house with no light switches, who ever lived there before me installed ceiling fans in all the rooms, the ceiling fans were ugly and I hated that I couldn't turn the light on before going into the room. I put this in the overhead light attached the light switch to the wall and that was that. I have had it for 5 years. They do get hot. I only use a 40 watt bulb because it gets so hot. I don't know how safe this is. I don't know what else to do. An electrician told me light switches are going to be very expensive and would involve a lot of tearing into walls. I have these in 2 different places and they work."
2,problems with range,"I have three switchs like this onethe problem is with the rangeIf transmitter is more than 5 meters, then receiver doesn't work"
4,GE Smart Home Devices - AWESOME!,"This device is super cool from the standpoint of very very easy installation... Can you screw in a light bulb? That's all you need to know about the install.Now get one or more of the activation switches, depending on your particular need/desire, etc., and you're ready to roll. The key chainswitch is super for turning on light as you arrive home. I have three exterior lights that I activate as a return home. Could also have nearby interior light come on too.. But, I can still manually flip a wall switch once inside. LOL Now, go have some fun!"
1,Explanation Required,Usually GE SmartHome products are good. Be careful where you buy yours from! This Item lists for about $15... Is $1.99 a deal? Remember: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. The company I got mine from uses multiple names. BUYER BEWARE !!!
4,My son loves it,"This seat was perfect for what we needed. It's nice and light, so easy to move around if we need to. My 3 year old son is a fan of Little Einsteins and I guess because it's red he calls it his ""Rocket seat"" and seems to really like it. I was a little nervous about him only being restrained by the seat belt (and when he had it in on of our cars, he was able to reach the seat belt button and escape-which was a little scary) but in the main car we use it in, he can't reach the button and it seems to do the trick."
5,Great quality w/adjustable back seat,"Very comfortable and easy to use. Light wieght--easy to move around. Just have to be carefull when taking it out of the car with one hand because the back comes off for a backless booster seat(not a problem at all, it only comes appart when the seat is adjusted/opened all the way flat, which will never happen inside the car). I really like the adjustable back, and it works great if your seats in the car are adjustable. I can adjust my seat in the car and then adjust the back on the booster seat for our doughter to take a nap on longer trips.(I had a little foam-padding pillow, that was noramlly used for back support, and it had fit right on the seat between the arm rests. I used it for my doughter to adjust her hight for the seat-belt. The opening slot for the seat belt above her shoulder was too hight. It also gave her a little more comfortable/softer ride.)"
5,turbo seat,Excellent product and Target is very fast. My grandaughter especially likes this style of seat.
5,Considered the safest on the market,"This seat is easy to secure in the car, has a high back for additional support, two arm rest for comfort and two cup holders for convience. Test show this to be one of the top seats manufactured. I give it a thumbs up."
4,"Easy, Comfy, Attractive","With the new (Summer, 2007) law in Washington that extends the booster seat years to age 8, I needed to purchase a new booster for my older daughter. She likes this bright red seat. It's comfortable, and she's eased back into booster-seat riding without protest.The seat was easy to set up, and was in the back seat of our Volvo in minutes.This review would be 5 stars if Graco had come up with a new concept for booster seats--ones that are soft, not hard plastic, perhaps, and quite inexpensive. Something that would encourage everyone who might drive a kid around to get one or--or maybe even car manufacturers to include one per seat as standard. Something that won't soon be a big pile in the landfill.With this seat, Graco has provided a solid option for the current design standard. But they haven't innovated."
5,More powerful than you can imagine,"This movie affected me a thousand times more than any other movie ever has--everything in it is completely perfectly done; all of the characters are perfectly acted, it's perfectly directed and written. Brilliant. Extremely difficult to watch because of the painful realism but, despite some other reviewers' complaints, the story was to me ultimately a personal story, and it was the way the individuals interacted that struck me; it was not solely a political film. I came out of the theatre seven hours ago, yet simply remembering certain scenes can still make me cry--and I imagine will continue to be able to. I'm definitely going to have to try and track down some other Yilmaz Guney films; I can't compliment this one enough."
5,Norelco 7745X Cool Skin Wet / Dry Cordless Rechargable Shaver,I have always had delicate facial and neck skin. Dry electric shavers and blade razors always left me with skin irritations. I use the Norelco 7745X Cool Skin Wet/Dry Cordless Rechargable Shaver with the Cool Skin Shave Lotion in the shower and my skin is irritation free. Never have I had a closer shave. I shave every day and I get 7 days of shaving on a single charge. I like the shaver and highly recommend it.
5,Great shaver,For the last 15 years I have been a manual razor user. I decided to try an electric razor and after researching found the Norelco 7745X to be just what I wanted. I can say that I am glad I did. It is very quiet and the lotion dispenser definitely makes shaving a joy.
4,Gets the job done.,"Works with regular shaving foam if you don't want to use the pricey Nivea cartridges, has no problem getting wet in the shower. This is what I needed, and what I got. The shave isn't as close as a blade, and you'll want a mirror if you use it in the shower. The battery life is fine and the device styling is a little nicer than that of most electric shavers."
5,Great Shaver,"WOW! Thats all I have to say. As a former Braun 360 user, I can assure you this razor works better than a Braun foil shaver. Very impressive results. It is as close a Mach 3 if you only shave with the grain when you us a Mach. If you save against the grain, this might not be good enough for you."
3,Decent Shave,Product gives my fiance a decent shave but one of the adapter pieces isn't that great. I don't think this item is worth $100 though.
3,Not a close shave...older model works better,"I ordered this shaver for my husband to replace his older Norelco Quadra. After trying it, we are returning it to Amazon. He says his old Quadra works better than the 7745X Cool Skin. It looks cool and the wet shave is nice but it takes longer to shave and the closeness is not up to expectations. The new shaver should shave as good or better than the older models. The shaver does work so if you don't have an electric shaver, this might be okay for you. My husband has dark, coarse hair and the blades just weren't ""cutting it."" Fine, light colored hair might improve the performance but, my advice is to look for something else in the same price range.Maybe our expectations were too high or the shaver really is lacking in performance. There was only one review when we made the purchase and maybe this will help others out there before money is wasted."
2,NOT ALL THAT,"I purchased the 7775X and I purchased the model below the 7745X and they both seemed to out-perform the 7745X. Although cleaning is easier, I do not find that this shaver removes the hair from my face with any efficacy at all.I also am not pleased with the way the Nivea Gel/lotion is dispensed from this shaver. I will not buy this again in the future and may have to purchase the 7775X to receive the shave I was accustomed to."
4,Two Thumbs Up ---WAY UP!,"Clearly not a big budget movie - but rather a raw, campy, no frills action flick. A ""B"" movie at its best. By all means worthwhile watching it with your buddies for a goof.As good as it is, not quite up to the Boz in Stone Cold....."
5,What a wondrful Family,"There should be more brother like this in the world, if there were things would be much more pleasant. In fact I would probably make room in my life for anyone of them. I hope Ms. Foster continues to write in this wonderful style."
4,Wonderful Book from a new Lori Foster Fan!,This was a GREAT book! I'm happy that I got all three books in one volume or it would've been horrible waiting for the next installment. The Winston brothers are wonderful and the stories were very well done. The only complaint I have is that the books were too short! I just bought Wild by Lori Foster and can't wait to get started. I'll be picking up any other books she's written and hope she continues to write full novels. Put it on your shopping list and get it soon.
4,Every Town Needs a Bar Like This One!,"The Winston Brothers are incredible! The sex scenes in the book, especially between Chase and Allison are sizzling and the interaction between the brothers is funny and touching.The book, comprised of three novellas about 3 of the 4 Winston Brothers is a quick and steamy read. I generally get annoyed with romance novels where the woman is a nervous 20 year old virgin and the sex is described with cutsey euphamisms. Thankfully, although two of the 3 women are virgins, the writing is anything but cutsey. This isn't sex with your hands over your eyes, this is sex with your eyes open and bravo to Lori Foster for writing it this way.My only complaint is that love and marriage happen so quickly, which, given that these men are such romeos, is hard to believe, but then again, it is a romance novel and it's all about fantasy, LOL."
3,"An okay offering,","I am as a rule a fan of Lori Foster, her stories are for the most part, exciting, sexy and just plain fun. That being said, I'd like to express my disappointment with this book. It read like something Stella Cameron might have written. It left a not so pleasant taste in my mouth. Come on Lori get it in gear and write something shockingly wonderful your many fans demand better of you! (You've spoiled us so sure me!)"
2,winston brothers,"this is the first lori foster book i've read, so i cant say that this is a pattern for her. also keeping in mind that this book was three stories in one book, and the author, obviously, was limited as to how far she could go with the story. that all being said, the book was a bit of a let down. i thought the three stories would be great had they been full length books. lots of story potential, just not enough room to expand on them. also, i thought her writing style was a bit pedestrian and amaturish. i think ms. foster has a great talent, but she needs more practice. then again, we cant all be nora roberts!"
2,Not my cup of tea,"I understand that they were short stories but it moved way too fast for my liking, there was nothing grasping about the stories it was mainly just porn on paper some of the times and except for the second story there was nothing worth reading going on. I was so bored reading it that sometimes, even when bored having nothing to do I preferred to lay on my bed and contemplate my own boredom rather than pick up the book...such a small thing and it took me more than a week to get through it and damn did I cheer when it was finally over!"
5,HOT HOT HOT!!!,"The Winston Brothers was an awesomely fast and entertaining read. I loved the quirkiness and inherit eroticism of all the characters as well as their enthusiasm and zest for living. This book got me caught up in the Winstons and the spin-off in Visitation, NC. Don't forget to get Zane's story in Wild. LOVED THIS BOOK!!!"
4,Fun and satisfying book.,"This was a book that I would consider very light, fun, and fanciful reading. I say fanciful because of the constant thought throughout the story of ""that would never happen."" But it never ruins the story if read as a light escape from more in depth romances such as Nora Roberts, Linda Howard, Susan Anderson, ect... (Which are some of my favorites). I really enjoyed this book and look forward to the sequel ""Wild."""
5,perfect,"Very sparkly, shiny and well made. the silver is thick and not too plyable. I've had it on since I've gotten it 3 days ago. I dont feel it at all. I love it.It was here in less than a week."
1,Disappointing at best,"This item was a very poor value. The cd course could have been a nice idea, but it was very short, full of mistakes and had quite a few misspellings. The test questions had mistakes and some questions didn't work at all. All in all, I am very disappointed because, for $175, I expected more.In order to install the software, one has to email the company, send the serial number and wait for them to respond back with the key to unlock the software. This is an unnecessary delay and a cumbersome attempt on the company's part to force you to register. I found that to be extremely annoying.Finally, there is no way to print out the certificate or save the image of the certificate that one receives when passing the exam other than to do a screenshot and edit it in a graphics program."
3,Beware of bad disks!,"This is a fabulous production, great singers, fascinating visual effects, etc. But I was so disappointed that both my disks (it is a 2-disk set) were printed somehow incorrectly so that the DVD fritzes out at the end, of both disks, on at least 4 different DVD players! I am sure the disks are defective but I don't have the receipt so I can't return it. I wonder if the Euroarts label is a cheap label? I have other opera DVDs and no problems. But with this Lohengrin set, BOTH disks behave badly in the same way! Very sad!"
1,"Poor video quality, Karen looks too old to be Elsa","Overall performance is excellent, the set is simplistic yet effective. But I am surprised that nobody mentioned about the poor video quality. It's like watching VHS tape copied about 30 times, on overused cassette. However, the cover art on DVD case looks amazing!And Karen Armstrong playing Elsa, looks way too old! I believe Elsa is supposed to be late teens (17? 18?) in the play. Karen Armstrong was ""only"" 41 when this was filmed, but she looks more or less about 50-60 in this opera. The wedding scene thus looked ridiculous...Peter Hofmann in contrast looks amazing as well as all other supporting roles. No wonder the album cover shows Hofmann's face, but not Armstrong's."
3,OK,"Serviceable. No Wager work is ever staged the way the artist originally intended. I thought the DVD would be subtitled in English, but it wasn't - which is a big disappointment."
2,Chico science is good,"it is good but only 2 of the songs appealed to me. the rest were just endless drum beats and rambling in portugeuse. its a shame chico science died, as he most likely couldve produced more good music such as crianca de domingo and manguetown but one of his members went to soulfly the other brazilian band. i amnt sure if he's still there. we miss u chico."
4,"Jagged Rhythms, Dark Movements","Compiled from two of the original Decca ARGO albums of 1990 and 1994 (Chamber Works & Music on the Floor], except for the track Flint, this single CD is somewhat less successful than Torke's more exuberant collections. They are subdued and darker, although they still carry his percussive and staccato pulses and his instrumentally lyrical la-la-la's. This especially seen with the four tracks of Music on the Floor [his musical manuscripts were indeed strewn upon the floor while in preparation]. Slate is a dance work of four mimialistic variations. Vandana is a student piece of 1984 and is a transitional work with classical underpinnings and an orderly grid permutation of notes. Rust is a later reexamination that continues the noisy, energetic, jaggedness, with piano and brass. Fint is for saxophone quartet and piano. If I were to suggest the music of Michael Torke to someone not familiar with his compositions, I would not choose this album."
4,Wonderful,"This book was extremely gripping from the first. I enjoyed the characters especially Lisa. She reminded me very much of myself. Headstrong, willful, and a crack up. The messes she can get into is halarious. You begin to feel as if you really know the characters. The book was wonderfully detailed until the end when the ending became extremely rushed. However I would still highly recommend this book. The characters were quite memorable and I hope that she will revisit them some time in another novel."
4,Enjoyable!,"This was a very enjoyable book with a great plot. I loved the intelligent conversations in it. So far, this has been the best of the series!"
2,A great trip ... but one I feel like I've taken before,"You do get lost in Moning's worlds, however her novels are so damn similar! Instead of this novel I reccomend reading The Highlander's Kiss and/or The Dark Highlander. They're better written even though they're by the same author. And if you're looking for time travel to Old World Scotland without the Faeries then try the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon."
3,Decent Book,"I bought this book based on the large number of excellent reviews. I must admit, it did not quite live up to my expectations. If you buy this expecting a Gabaldon-like story, then this book will definitely disappoint, because it in no way comes close to the rich culture, history, and experience of her books. On the other hand, if you buy this book looking for a sensual romance, you will again be disappointed. Or, to put it better, you will be disappointed until over midway through, when the romance finally picks up some. It definitely offers a more whimsical approach to romance, but I find the books of Teresa Medeiros to be a more amusing magical story, and those from Constance O'Day Flannery to be a more romantic time-travel story. I suppose my problem with this book is that it failed to deliver a real punch in any way. I would recommend it as a decent read, though, personally, I didn't get into the book at all until halfway through, where it became lightly enjoyable."
4,Another great book from KMM!,"The third in the Highlander series, and the third book I've ready by Karen Marie Moning. These titles just keep getting better and better! Definitely, a keeper."
5,I dont' know how anyone could not love this writer,I loved ALL of these books. I read one and then had to have them all. Adam was funny and got into alot of trouble. These books are keepers and a definate must read.
5,Wow,"What can I say Amadan definitely makes a revealing scene in this book and when Circeen comes to and learns how to deal...well, what else can you say, but wow?"
5,"A ""Touch"" of Karen Marie Moning","Ms Moning once again hands us a tale of love that transcends time. Our fiesty heroine--Lisa, finds herself with the weight of the world on her shoulders, when suddenly she's thrown back in time to land literally at the naked feet of the powerful, immortal Circenn Brodie. The differences between the modern woman and the medieval man cause moments of tension and misunderstanding...as well as several scorching scenes between the two. With Circenn, being immortal, and swearing not to go through the pain of losing love again, Lisa finds her way into his heart. The ""gift"" Circenn gives to Lisa is immeasurable-- his love; but, at what cost to all? You MUST read this book to find out!From page one, we are swept into the characters lives, and become part of them until the very end. With stong emotions and extrordinary wit and humor, Karen Moning brings her characters to vivid life upon the page. One of Karen Monings finest works to date...I anxiously await her next book!!"
1,A Disappointment,"After reading the Outlander series, by Diana Gabaldon, I went in search of other time travel, romance, historical, adventure novels. According to other reviews, Karen Marie Moning was another acclaimed writer worthy of reading. Well, sorry to disappoint Moning fans, but I was sorely disappointed. I couldn't even read past the first chapter, it was so badly written. IF you like ""fluff"", then this is for you. I, however, enjoy a well written, well researched, and well articulated novel, and one I can get my teeth into. I found this book, and others like it, ..."
2,Strange,"I have to admit this is one of the weirdest romances I have ever read. Not that I mind the time travel thing, truly I can be open-minded. It was just too strange, what with the themes of immortality and being able to change anything about anybody, the weird fairy things, etc. I felt it needed some more boundaries on reality! I just didn't click with the characters.BUT - the sex was AWESOME!"
1,very lame,"(...) This book has got to be the stupidist one I've ever read. This is supposed to be a romance book, right? The characters should fall in love, right? Granted, there's always an immediate attraction, but somewhere along the line they fell in love and I missed it.There's too much going on in the book. First there's Robert the Bruce, then there's a group of fairies, then there's Duncan and Galan (where the hell did the redhead come from, and why does she matter?), the future is still going on without Lisa... Isn't the book supposed to be about the ""Highlanders' Touch?""And the whole ""bond"" thing has got to be the stupidest thing I've ever heard of. And if the book has a conflict in it that supposed to be resolved, you can't just change the future to fix it, it supposed to be worked out, like maybe Circenn bequeaths several million to the Stone family in 2000, and Lisa never has to pay the bills or something.And the hero's not supposed to stay immortal. (...)"
5,KMM has done it again!,"I have become a fan of KMM's writing since her first book came out. Having patience while waiting for the next book is never easy, but I've never been let down! KMM has done it again! This is a fabulous romance novel! I couldn't put it down! Can August get here any quicker??"
3,"Good, but not her best","The Highlander's Touch is a good read, but I would recomend Ms. Moning's first book, Beyond the Highland Mist more. With that said, the characters of Lisa and Circenn are well drawn out and believable. However, some of the story elements were pretty unbelievable. Now, I like the idea of time travel and can get lost in that concept, but, there were many other added magic touches that were too much, such as; mind melding, changing the future to suit Lisa, and going back in forth in time like you would go on vacation. The ending seemed rushed and too ""happily ever after"". I think this author has a bright future with this type of genre and should continue to write them, perhaps with a little more reality thrown in."
5,Love transcends time....,"A cursed flask brings Circenn Brodie, a warrior from the past, together with Lisa Stone, a woman from the future. He is a man who does note break his oaths and he has sworn to kill the bearer of the flask. A task easier said than done when he realises how beautiful and courageous Lisa is. They fall in love (duh!) but Lisa is determined to return to her century as she has left behind a mother dying of cancer and needs to be there with her to the end.I shall leave the ending for you to find out but I must add that it was a an unexpected twist for me. I've read Adam's story (the person Circenn made the oath to) and enjoyed it immensely! My advice is to read all the books in this series - I find them intriguing and enjoyable. Keep writing Ms Moning - I'm a big fan!"
1,Extremely rushed fairy tale,"After reading all the positive reviewing about Karen Marie Moning Highlander series, I finally decide to read this book. What a disappointment! This is an extremely rushed fairy tale, the drama and suspense is childish and uneven, the love story inadequately rooted and the resolution just a bit pat. An easy read and quickly to forget novel without skills or history."
1,Whaaat?,"I am astounded that the average rating for this book is so high. The storyline is rushed, and the writing is poor at best. Most grade-school children could write with the degree of complexity that Moning has achieved with this work. If you are looking for quality romance (Diana Gabaldon, Judith McNaught, etc.) I advise you to avoid this one."
3,Storyline is good.,"Good storyline, but too much hot 'n bother. The whole series is pretty good, actually."
3,Not as good as the others,"I have just started reading Ms. Moning's books and I very much enjoyed ""Highland Mist"" and ""To Tame a Highland Warrior"", but I found this story a bit disappointing. It seemed to move away from the Scottish history/landscape into fantasy. There was, of course, some of that in the other books, but it's not really my style and I just didn't enjoy it as well. I've started Kiss of the Highlander (or is it Highlander's Kiss, I can't remember) and I'm enjoying that a lot more.On the other hand, this book teaches the reader more about Adam Black and gives him another facet to his ""person""ality, which, since I know there is a book I have not read that has Adam as the main character, will probably be important."
5,"Well written, well researched, well done again.","The entirety of this series (thus far) has been as the review title states, well written & well researched. Far and few are times that I am absolutely unable to put a book down, but this book was glued to my hands from the first page to the last.The story has all the makings of a fantastic fairytale...romance, action, suspense and intrigue all wrapped up in a tall, dark, brooding, well-defined package. If one is to lose themselves temporarily in the alternate world of a good book...this is it."
3,Slow start,"As much as I have enjoyed all books I read by Karen Moning -- first 2 of Highlander series, and all of the Shadow series -- This one did not grab my interest right away and it took awhile to get into it. Story seemed much simpler, but still a fun read."
3,Not a bad way to spend a rainy afternoon...,"I didn't actively dislike this book, but I did realize very shortly after finishing it that I had already forgotten nearly everything about it. I've tried both this book and the first book of the author's Fever series, and I think her books simply aren't for me. However, if I have a friend who loves supernatural romance, I would mention this author's books and tell them to give it a go, because everyone's taste is different."
5,Dont have to be broken hearted no more...,"I think she did a wonderfull job writing this book..She is a wonderfull person,and a beautiful writer..."
1,Part of a long tradition,"There's actually a long tradition of hatchet-job novels written by the spurned lovers of famous writers. Sinclair Lewis and Thomas Wolfe both felt the axe in their day. This is certainly the closest Jay McInerney will ever come to joining their company.Needless to say, I didn't open this book expecting anything on the level of Colette's ""The Vagabond"". All I asked for were a few laughs at Jay's expense and some glittery New York scenes. They weren't there. I can only mourn the trees that were sacrificed for this one..."
5,A delightful introduction to one of nature's wondrous sea creatures,"With Donna Rathmell's simple, straightforward text suitable for children grades 1 to 3, and illustrated with the color photography of Barbara Bergwerf, Caronlina's Story: Sea Turtles Get Sick Too! is the true life story of the rehabilitation of a loggerhead turtle. Young readers get to see the inside of a turtle hospital, where sick and injured sea turtles are cared for and then released back into the wild when they are healthy. The final pages offer fun facts and a ""make your own sea turtle"" cutouts designs for photocopying and rainy day fun. A delightful introduction to one of nature's wondrous sea creatures."
4,Entertaining and informative!,"Carolina's Story: Sea Turtles Get Sick Too! is an informative photographic journal of a sea turtle that is critically ill. The photographs and accompanying narrative journal the sea turtle from the time she is found, and as she is cared for and nursed back to health.At the back of the book is a section titled, ""Creative Minds,"" which includes turtle fun facts, math games, a craft project and photos.Children will be enthralled as they hear Carolina's story and look at the pictures. And they will rejoice as Carolina, fully recovered, is released back into the ocean.Armchair Interviews says: Carolina's Story: Sea Turtles Get Sick Too! is a wonderful and educational addition to a child's library. Adults and children will enjoy the book and learn at the same time."
4,green glasses from Amazon,Product I wanted but not the size I thought I was getting.I kept them anyway because they were so pretty and matchedmy other glasses but did not extend my count of the sizeI wanted.
3,Much darker blue,"I think the color looks more black than blue,at least in person. I like the style and the weight/feel of them. I am going to keep them but was rather disappointed to see they look nothing like the blue color in the picture"
5,Very Pretty,"These goblets are sturdy and nicely sized. More blue than turquoise, but look very pretty. Good buy. They were package well."
5,Goblets are beautiful,"These goblets are beautiful, I have them in three colors now. Much bigger than you'd think and heavy too. The ones that did arrive broken were quickly replaced. Thank You. I really love them."
2,Nice goblets but packaging is lousy,I ordered several sets of these. They actually come in boxes of 4 and two are packed seperately in paper. None of them are packed adequately for shipping and about 30% of them were broken. The goblets sre pretty but they must be adequately package to make it worth your while.
5,Wow! These are beautiful!,"The quality of these goblets is excellent! I bought a set of four and just ordered another set. The color is rich and the goblet feels great in your hand. The package arrived early but (similar to other reviews) the packaging of the box in which the goblets were packed left something to be desired! At any rate, the goblets were encased inside a Styrofoam holder and that served to keep them safe. I highly recommend these goblets. These will look great on my ""Valentine"" dinner table!"
2,Disappointed,When I bought these for almost $50 for 4 I thought they were great. Happened to just barely touch one of them it tipped over on the counter and the stem broke off. Something that costs that much money shouldn't break that easiely
4,Amazing action scenes,"The whole movie is action pack. The shooting scene is as cool as million dollars movies. So many exotic locations, great acting, exciting story and great production value for the budget the producer had. If you truly value independent movies, this is the must-watch movie."
5,Good fun,"This movie was a lot of fun. If you're a fan of action films that don't waste your time with slow paced unnecessary scenes, then this film is for you. There's butt kicking from the beginning to end. And yes, guns and ladies are included :-D"
1,wow what a low budget garbage film,simply garbage. So low budget I could make a better film with walmart cameras. I actually paid money for this but watched ten minutes and turned it off. Total garbage and fake fighting! zero stars
3,Enjoyable,"I think this is underrated as a movie. While it is not Terminator, Predator, or the similar Total Recall, it is certainly not a dude. An interesting sci fi about cloning, mixed with a big budget action arnold movie. If you enjoy Arnold's movies, then this is one your shouldn't miss. Lively throughout, with enough originality to keep you interested from beginning to end."
2,Made for Hollywood,"Cheezy dialogue, obvious plot, predictible characters, gratuitous violence, completely out of touch with what goes on with the real special ops people, this has all the ingredients that appeal to those who rely on Hollywood for their ""literary"" venue. Yes, this is fiction, yes fiction is supposed to be entertaining. But what age group is the author trying to appeal to?"
2,What a joke!,"The diameter of the handle on this cleaner is HUGE, and formed from two pieces of rigid, molded plastic making it difficult and awkward to grip. The handle seam is incredibly deep and rough, and within a few minutes of cleaning, I had blisters on both hands. Since the cleaning project was already started, my husband offered a short term solution by wrapping the handle with duct tape.The removable tool and hose rack is a flimsy piece of plastic that would be best just left in the box.It seems to clean okay, and by that I mean it cleans no better than my daughter's far less expensive, lighter model that does not have a hand-tearing handle."
4,Thoreau through the seasons,"Just when I think I've seen every modern-day compilation of Thoreau quotations, I turn down an aisle at a used bookstore and gasp in pleasant surprise. Henry David Thoreau wrote in 1850 about ""a sweet wild world which lives along the strain of the wood thrush,"" and here William White reveals glimpses of that realm through selected journal entries arranged by season. White rightly asserts that the transcendentalist's formal poems are clumsy concoctions and are less than memorable, but his prose -- especially portions of his journal -- contains a poetic quality worthy of transcribing into free verse form. Hence, this volume. Individual excerpts appear on separate pages and are enhanced with 16 seasonal pen-and-ink illustrations by Georgia Dearborn. A tasteful gift idea for nature lovers, and certainly less expensive than one of the innumerable coffee table books with full-color photos accompanied by random quotes."
5,Excellent Educational tool,This book is a wonderful collection of information that can be incorporated into a classroom in all subjects or just as a fun resource in the home!!!!
2,WARNING: Open package received with signs of used product,"Just wanted to warn any potential buyers that I received an open package buying from Amazon LLC. I think that's pretty disgusting since this is a product that's intended for consumption by your pet. Also, there were portions of the red ""meat"" that looked like it had been chewed on and the white bone portion was stained red all over. Basically it looked as if a dog had chewed on it for a little and then repackaged up and sold on Amazon. Buyer beware."
5,One of his favorites!,"Out of all of the different bones and treats we've given our dog, these are one of his all time favorites!"
2,Disappointed,"My disappointment was with the width of the bracelet, it seem to be for a small or young child an item with that kind of detail and for the price should have a little more in width so it can be seen.LB"
5,Good Wall Map,"Ordered this wall map to use on a boy's room wall. Proved to be a good size in which to add to the room's travel theme. Also made of a heavy weight paper with a thick lamination. Perfect to withstand some mistreatment it might receive from said boy. Originally thought of using the write on/wipe off pen, but decided to use push pins (with flags) to mark places traveled to. Again, the maps stiffness and lamination were great for this purpose. Map arrived rolled in a tube, so it was ready to hang directly from the box."
5,Love it!,"I was thrilled with this map of the world! It's the best one out there and as a teacher I've seen a lot of them. I bought it for my fourth grade classroom, and I loved it so much I bought one for the home office. I'll be ordering another one for my six year old granddaughter who also loves it."
3,Sex in The Army,"This movie deserves a 3-star rating because it offers little. The story is an inane one (centerfolds get starnded in South American territory and a group of soldiers have to save them). The acting is somewhat realistic (some actors try so hard it becomes obvious). There are some great scenes in the movie: like the two interns ""entertaining"" the president and when the soldiers are ""thanked"" by the centerfolds. For some reason they added a love story which to me seemed out of place. The general reminisces about his girl when a group of hot babes surround him; like a man will think about marriage when many woman want to bed him! All in all it wasn't a bad movie."
4,Major Rock,"I Loved This Movie, It Was Great. It Was Well Worth The MOney I Paid. I Recommend This Movie To All Of You. This Will Be One Purchase You Won't Regret."
2,Disappointed,"I agree with the other reviewers, this book is filled with generalizations. It expresses how marketing is significant to your job search but doesn't go into enough detail to be truly useful. I believe the author came from a marketing background and does not have enough hands-on experience as a career/job search advisor to be writing job search books. The only value I got from this book had to do with ""positioning,"" which is merely understanding what makes you different from others. I can tell you the secret in one sentence that took the author 133 pages: write a summary that reflects your values and/or aptitudes and make sure the rest of your resume is filled with examples that support it. In closing, saving your time and [price] and look into Knock `em Dead by Martin Yate. I found it much more useful!"
2,bumptious divertissement,"Mr Delany enjoys a widespread acclaim by critics and common readers: with good cause, his mastery of the language is outstanding and he knows perfectly how to develop a good story.Both qualities are to be found and appreciated in ""Phallos"" too but an author so esteemed must perforce keep his standards extremely high.In this work he choses a literary topos: he feigns he has found an older work by an unknown author, a pornographical novel set in the late Roman empire and he engages the reader in a witty, cultured commentary on this novel, inserting erotic excerpts from the same.Problem is, his ""commentary"" is not witty enough to stand on its own feet, and the excerpts, though teasing enough, are not so outright erotic as to give satisfaction at least in that way.To read this work is just like reading an interesting literary essay (with some useless shows of erudition where the language is convoluted) about a work which does not exist."
3,Works But Not As Advertised,"If you want quick hard boiled eggs, this is pretty easy. Results taste good, but are not pretty - or at least I have not found the right cooking times and power levels to get smooth results.The trick is to figure out what works in your microwave. Using the package recommendations resulted in egg blowouts in my microwave. I since learned that egg at Power 4 for 65 seconds yields a hard boiled egg that tastes good. It's not pretty (looks like something that was in a shootout), but it works and I can quickly have a couple of hard boiled eggs without boiling water or peeling. More experimentation is definitely needed... also, the scrambled eggs do come out light and fluffy and it is wonderful to be add spices before the cooking.So, bottom line, I like this product, but beware that it may take some experimentation to get it to work right with your microwave."
4,Egg Wave Still Great,"Had bought some of these many years ago and over time they needed to be replaced. Was happy to see they still make them. Work like a charm. Key is to put a little salt on top of the egg before cooking and to get the cooking time just right for your microwave. Once you get the timing, they work every time. Easiest way to cook an egg. A little non-stick spray inside and they wipe right out."
5,Very good recopilation of fantastic music,"In this second set of King Crimson guides there is music of the 1981-2003 period. There are two studio CD's plenty of the music of this period. Though it is not advertised anywhere, the studio CD's are HDCD encoded and they have fantastic sound. The two other CD's are a collection of live recordings of these period. In this case they are not HDCD encoded, but they also sound very good. If you want an introduction to the KC music of this period, this collection is excellent."
5,PSI Factor - A different kind of Chronicle,"At first glance this book looked like it would be hard to follow with the way the chapters are set up. Boy, was I wrong. It flows very well. It is very refreshing to see a book set up so differently and have it be so easy to read. I love being able to read just a chapter at a time. It covers case stories one to a chapter. No chapter is more than eight pages long. It great for reading when you just have 10 minutes here and there. The stories are very well presented. I am ready for volume II =)"
1,Just another Notch in the new age wave of fluffy pablum,"Not the greatest of books. Those wishing to learn about Celtic roots and the celtic peoples would be wiser to study the Tain and Barddas, and the whole other host of authors doing real reconstructionism. Try RJ stewart. Another weird thing about this book is, why is the goddess on the front of the cover black ? I mean this is a book about the British people and their godess. The least the author could have done was pay tribute to the culture she is writting about, instead of ""spicing it up"" with multi-culturalist wiccan ideals."
5,Melissa,this is a great single cd. deifinatly get it if you collect bsb items. i got two. one to listen to and one to not open!
3,Decent and down-right campy,"The boys do a great job singing the song. The remixes are decent but not the best dance remixes, though. They are moderately danceable.What's hilarious is CONVERSATION MIX. If you've outgrown BSB, this mix is worth the camp value! A bit cheesy but all the young girls will swoon over it. Great marketing, although not timely at all."
2,it's a nice song,"i love this song,i gave me deep impression when i heard it first time,i aslo like the music video."
5,KNOWLEDGE IS POWER!,The information in this book helped me to better understand how my abusive partner thinks and enabled me to make an intelligent decision on how I should handle this relationship. I highly recommend this book for anyone in an abusive relationship.
5,great information,"If this information sounds even a little familiar, run as far & as fast as you can. It has nothing to do with you & he will never change. There is nothing you can do that will ever be ""good enough"". I wasted 24 years trying. There are great suggestions in this book to help you plan. Save your energy for you. The best information of the many, many books I have read on this topic."
3,Why does he do that?,There is some great information but I feel that Lundy oversimplifies abusive behaviour and presents a model of treatment that may cause further shame in men who suffer from shame based identities.
1,Take with a grain of salt,"I must say I am surprised by all of the raving reviews that this book is getting, but in my own personal opinion, it does not apply to the typical abuser and should be read with a grain of salt. The book claims that abusers having low self-esteem is a myth, which much research and a friend of mine who is a therapist disagrees with. (from his personal experiences too) Perhaps the author is only seeing one side of his clients - the front that these people present to the world that hides their insecurities and false beliefs. The book does a good job of classifying the different types of abuse and the different stages of abuse, but appears to miss the core of the problem. The author seems rather biased siding with victims. (Victims need an advocate, but this isn't going to solve their problem.) Yes, an abuser deserves no excuses - but I believe there are core problems/perspectives of people who abuse that are not being covered in this book."
4,Why does she do that?,"I'm impressed by the reviews and will read the book, but must offer a caveat. This book has been applied by my lover to interpret me.When you use a book about abusive men to decipher your lover (and have a history of abuse by men), your inevitable will be that your lover is abusive. I hope that's not absolute!"
5,A MUST-READ,"This book is awesome. I was finally able to make sense of my verbally and emotionally abusive first marraige and how it affected everyone. It explains the thought process of an abusive person, and documents how the legal system continues the abuse. If you are a victim of abuse (past or present), an attorney, a judge, a victim's advocate, a police officer or a therapist, you MUST READ THIS BOOK!"
4,Why are you with him?,"I work in the field of domestic violence and we had one former client who swears by Bancroft.This book actually addresses the issue of ""Verbal Abuse"" not just Physical abuse. Bancroft helps the reader reflect the mental dangers that abuse cause. Until you read this book some of these issues may not even be apparent to the victim. I highly recommend this book. Signed a previous victim.The behavioral dynamics of abuse are well detailed along with the most common responses of victims."
5,Book of answers,"Highly recommend this book for anyone dealing with an angry and abusive man. If you think it's all in your head, its not, and this book explains why."
5,Why Does He Do That,This is a great bok! It handles the topic of abuse very sensitively. The author is very careful to handle the victims with kid gloves. This is a must see for abused women!
5,This book is the key to reclaiming your sanity,"A wonderful group of ladies recommended this book to me at a very low point...and I am so happy they did. I was told its like a magician revealing his tricks...and its true. When you can identify someones affliction, the symtoms dont affect you anymore. Amazing ...."
5,Excellent Seller!,"I loved this book. It gave a lot of answers to a lot of unanswered questions. I would highly recommend this book to anyone involved present or past to an abusive relationship be it physical or mental. NO ONE should allow themselves to put up with such behavior. WE ARE WORTH MORE THAN THIS!!!KUDDOS to the seller for fast service, fast shipping, easy transaction. Keep up the good work. Thanks!"
4,Helpful,"This was a helpful resource. It was encouraging to know that what I already knew about my angry man wasn't just all in my head and irrelevant.A pattern tells a story. If you have noticed a pattern that results in unhealthy behavior, there are underlying reasons for this. Knowing more about why they do what they do is so uplifting to the receiver. If you know why, then by default you know why not, as well. This book helped me to understand this. I would recommend it."
5,Best information ever,If you are looking to read about abuse this is the book. I have read many and this is very informative on your abuser and for you. READ IT!
5,An inside look at the abusive personality,"I have never before found such an insightful book concerning the common behavior of emotionally abusive men. It's as if I have finally found a way to verbalize the purgatory in which I have been immersed for the past 6 years. If you know there is something wrong with your relationship, but every time you try to express your feelings you are accused of attacking your partner or being too demanding; if you feel like your partner does not respect you or anything you have to say; if you feel like your partner would rather take advice from a pole than from you; or that no matter what happens your partner finds a way to make the whole thing your fault, you should read this book!It will help you determine if your partner is indeed abusive and if he is the type of individual who might actually change (or one that probably won't)."
5,"Good, even if you have not been physically abused.","This book was recommended to me in a class I attended for women who have experienced abuse of some kind. I was not physically abused, but the book clearly explains that it was written for all forms of abuse, and you can read what applies to your situation. It has given me incredible insight that has helped me understand what was behind abusive behaviors, and my unhealthy reaction to them. Sometimes I was amazed at how closely this book reported my own life experience, and it made me feel better that I was not the only one living with my shame and secrets."
5,A Must Read,"For anyone who has tried and tried and tried to either understand, make peace with, or HOPE an angry/controlling man will CHANGE... YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK.... Reading this book has started me on a path to being in charge of my own life for the first time in many years. This book is clear and concise yet its message is very powerful. Angry and Controlling men are very very difficult to live with and almost impossible to change--why should they??--they almost ALWAYS get what they want one way or another. Their sense of entitlemant and almost total lack of empathy makes them very poor choices for a loving and respectful relationshp. The author addresses the dynamics of living with an angry and controlling man in a honest, direct manner borne of a lot of experience. It is easy to read, understand and; unfortunately for some of us, easy to identify with.Reading this book is very affirming and validating to women who live with and endure someone who is angry and controlling."
1,Standard feminazism that ignores women's violence towards men,"This is the standard feminist diatribe which offers the (false) presumption that men account for all violence and abuse between the sexes. Martin Fiebert of Cal State Long Beach has published a compendium of research which has found that women batter men as often as the converse. Unfortunately, the domestic violence industry, and other bastions of radical feminism (including the mainstream media) have ignored these findings for over 30 years."
4,Why Does He Do That?,"This book was written in a very understandable and informative way. For anyone, including family members, facing the heartbreak of anger and battering, leading to the breakdown of the family, this book gives invaluable information."
3,Male reader ruined it,"I purchased the audio version after reading a bit of the book and found it to be interesting and helpful. I travel a lot and thought I would get much story being able to listen to it while I am driving. But since it is a book for women, about men and about such a emotional subject for us it ruins it having a man narrate the story. Ruined.Women are the readers of this book - it should have a woman narrator. Period."
5,Great book!,Bancroft uses his extensive experience to bust through the myths associated with abusive men. A great book for women and men (if they are MAN enough to read it!)
5,Slef help the best way,"Good self-help book I have ever read. It is a completely fresh ""take"" on abusive relationships. I urge any woman who thinks she may be in one to get this book and read it immediately. ItI cannot say enough about how life changing this book is. It is actually difficult to read because (If) the shock of recognition is so painful.[...]"
5,Should be required reading for anyone who deals with people,"Great book. Read it. Even if you don't think you know an abusive person, read it. The book focuses mainly on abusive men, but can easily be transferred to abusive women, because it explains very well how abusive people think and how it affects their treatment of others. Also, Bancroft states several times that it is WORK for someone to be willing to change their abusive thinking and most don't really, truly change. He really does a good job of explaining WHY and describing what happens inside the mind of an abusive person."
5,huge help,The best book ever!!!!!! Helped me a LOT. Made me sure I left relationship undoubtedly right (axially could do it long time ago). Explained practically every my-ex-soon -to- be word about his first marriage (even their counseling). Showed me it's useless still to try to find the most possible understandable words about my feelings and stopped all dialogs with him in my head. With this knowledge now I can pull myself from depression and flat emotions and move on.I even gave this book to my psychologist. She said it was eyes-opening. I think this book HAS TO BE in psychologists learning programs. And EVERY woman needs to read it and give daughters to read too.
5,Very helpful!,"I was given this book when i had gone to our local safe harbors. It helped me in so many ways, i have given this book to others in abusive situations. A must read, dont get turned off by the title!!"
4,Helpful,This book gave me a better look at the craziness that goes along with verbal abuse. I have been in a verbally abusive relationship for 16 years and it is has been a struggle. The insight that Lundy gives has been helpful in eliminating some of the confusion brought on during thistime.
5,a MUST read for ALL women,"This is the best book about domestic violence I've ever read. It's the only one i've found that gets to the core of why men abuse. Rather than making excuses, he explains how abuse is a conscious decision, it's a learned behaviour, and it CAN be unlearned in the men decide to do the work (though sadly, most don't).Every woman should read this book even if she hasn't been outright abused because it also shows how these men can manipulate and control without even raising their voice. 10/10."
3,Stiff reading,It is written by someone who knows a lot about abusive men. Not all men fit this stereotype but some women do
1,no credentials,"For a professional field that values degrees and certifications. Lundy Bancroft has No degree, no certifications, no license, and no research cited in most of his books. Just saying! His writings are trash and do harm to many innocent men. He is a fraud!"
2,Feminist View Of Abuse,"As a professional counselor I appreciated that the author did not offer excuses for any type of abuse. Much of what he said is very true. However, this book is written from a feminist prospective. To the casual reader any behavior of a male can be misconstrued as abusive.Likewise, he does not discuss the issues of verbal and/or physical female abuse, On page 97 and in chapter 5 he actually implies that if a male claims to be the victim of an abusive female that he probably was (and is) abusive. He also suggest that a man who questions a woman's assertion of abuse is likewise an abuser.This book may help a codependent woman to finally come to her senses and leave an abusive situation. However, it may result in some men getting falsely accused of abuse by a Borderline wife or significant other."
4,Why does he do that?,Every young women should read this book before they start dating and certainly before they get married! The signs of a potentially abusive relationship are always there but we sometimes can't make sense of the little bullying signs that inevitably escalate. Walk away and save yourself years of torment. This book will open your eyes. Excellent for students studying psychology. Wish I read it years ago.
5,Well written and Informative Book,This was a very informative book. I was in an abusive relationship for 10 years and the information gave me a better understanding of the dynamics of this relationship and how to move on and find a healthier relationship in the future. Now I see the warning signs.
5,Why Does He DO That????,"This was one of the finest learning books I have ever read / studied. I have already lent it to two people and have recommended it to five or six others as a ""must have"" for their libraries.When I was a psych major in college, 40 plus years ago, ""abuse"" was not a topic. I'm glad that this now is being addressed.When I was ""browsing"" among the self-help titles in the listings, this book ""jumped out at me.""I'm really, really, REALLY glad that I got this book.A.J. in Scottsdale, Arizona"
5,Educate Me,"WHAT A GREAT BOOK!!! Thank you Mr. Bancroft for writing it. It ALL makes sense now. I just figured out that I was with an abuser...and NO, he didn't hit me...YET. I felt the author of this book was explaining my own (just over)relationship to ME! My ex-boyfriend fit this profile exactly and fortunately I ended before he caused me further heartache and pain. I would highly rate this book for any woman who is having difficulty in her relationship (s) and is torn between what is real and what her guy is ""saying"". Your perceptions aren't wrong and this author will help you see just what is going on. He is straight up and to the point and gives you great examples of what these guys do to throw you off balance. WOW...GREAT BOOK!!! By reading this book, I just saved myself from a life of misery."
5,Invaluable,"In my search for information to help me understand and recover from my abusive marriage, I found this book. Instead of comforting me and talking about MY feelings, this book helped me to understand how my husband really viewed me. It revealed his thinking, and what role I really played in his life. This information was shocking. In this book, my husband was described with amazing accuracy, his actions, his words... and the thinking behind them. My confusion is gone. My pain is gone. I still have a ways to go before I feel fully recovered, but this book helped me to make huge leaps in that direction. If I had known the warning signs of abuse, which are all listed and explained in this book, I think I would have been spared what my children and I went through. I am grateful to Mr. Bancroft for making this book available to abused women everywhere."
5,great book on the underlying attitudes causing abuse,"Virtually every sentence in this book provided a nugget of wisdom which helped me to understand abuse, its underlying causes, and steps to take in order to heal from having been a victim of abuse. I have never been abused by a romantic partner, but I was abused as a child, and I see that the same factors were at work in my situation as are in place for partner abuse. This book can help a victim of any type of abuse to understand their situation and to begin healing. The author is very sympathetic to abuse victims. One of the key insights I got out of the book was the fact that abuse is not a product of bad relationship dynamics- it is the result of choices the abuser makes. I would like to thank the author for writing this book."
5,I continue to read this book over and over. Highly Recommend!!!!,"If you REALLY want to understand what is TRULY happening in your life, living with an abusive partner, this is a book you MUST READ! Lundy covers all aspects within abusive relationships. HE MISSES NOTHING! This book has helped me gain the courage and understand why it was vital to collect my children and remove us from an abusive, unhealthy and destructive relationship. I owe our lives to this book. Thank you Lundy for all the answered questions, help understanding why the abuse was not our fault and how important it is to protect me and my children mental well being and safety!Staying in an abusive relationship allows the abuse to worsen not get better. Don't get your hopes on thinking your abusive partner will change because they won't, addiction or not! They haven't changed yet have they? It isn't easy but you CAN do it and you MUST do it! Believe me everything WILL work out!"
5,excellent resource,"I am a psychologist who periodically has patients in an abusive relationship or in a relationship with an anger-prone partner. This book has been very, very helpful for them. I would recommend it to anyone, whether a therapist or a layperson, with an interest in learning about relationships, anger, or verbal, emotional, and physical abuse. In addition to describing different types of abusive behaviors and the dynamics that lead a person to stay in an abusive relationship (one of the hardest things for outsiders to understand), this book covers other emotional, medical, legal, and parenting issues, and provides additional resources. Though the book focuses primarily on abusive male to female relationships,much of it is applicable to any type of controlling or abusive situation, regardless of gender or of the nature of the relationship (romantic, friendly, workplace)."
4,BIBLE on abuse,"I'm so thankful I read this book. He puts to words, what I never could. He explains what it is like to be in a relationship with an abusive mate. Why they act the way they act, and most importantly that you are NOT crazy. This book has given me so much knowledge and strength."
2,Great description of *what* but less on *why*,"After working with abusive men for a few years, the book is a GREAT description of the signs,symptoms and tactics of abuse but is less helpful in understanding the ""why"". Therapy for these guys doesn't have to be 'in your face, confess, confess, confess, eat dirt' although from the victim's perspective it seems totally appropriate. Confrontive and combative approaches often lead to further resistance and entrenchment.Lundy presents a feminist view of partner interaction but leaves out alternative explanations, theories and approaches."
5,Best book ever,A Must for everybody working with conjugal violence victims or abusors. This definitely is a great tool to explain to victims why their partners act that way.
5,Excellent,"Book ordered came in two days, exactly in condition as described. Book helps describe the type of people who can be abusive in your life, how to tell if they are abusive (verbally as well as physically), recommended reading for anyone who thinks they might be or have been abused. Thank you."
5,Top of the list,"I won't go into extensive explanation for why this book is my favorite just above Patricia Evans' popular book on the same type of personality. I will say this book is clearer and more honest in it's assessment and it was a light in the dark for me. I highly recommend this book as I own MANY other titles that address the topic of abusive men. As I walk through and live in this reality, the book I reach for first is this one. Funny thing, some of my other books have gone magically ""missing"". Maybe because my DH hasn't stopped long enough to read the cover more closely! Hah!"
5,A Must-Read,"For both men and women who feel concerned by the title of this book, this Must Be Your Only Read of the Year if you have time for just one book. The mysteries of the angry mind and how it operates are elucidated by an Experienced, empathetic, hands-on psychologist who know what he is talking about. I can't praise this work highly enough. Every word struck home. Read it !"
1,No Original recordings,"My personal crusade continues - I want Amazon to let people know when they are buying a CD that has re-recordings by the original artists. Personally, I hate them. At first, you enjoy the songs, then as you sing along like you used to when you heard them on the radio, suddenly, it is just a bit different. Usually, the vocals are not quite as powerful or energetic. After a while it really starts to annoy you. By the end of the disc, you are ready to toss the disc in the garbage. It's like that with this disc. Plus it annoys me that I was deceived into buying this disc when the original recordings are available.""Get Used to It"" by Roger Voudouris is fairly difficult to come by. I recommend getting the ""Have a Nice Day - Super Hits of the 70s"" series by Rhino instead of this disc. Get the Rhino series while they are still readily available and reasonably priced."
5,Know Japanese culture deeply,"I like this book very much, and can let foreigner know Japanese culture more and more, deep and deep."
2,There are better ones and on Amazon,"I bought this book with ""Cooking with Steam"" and ""Cuisine ala Vapeur"". This book is the weakest of the three for me. Most of the recipes used food I cannot eat. I have gastrointestinal issues that force me to steam my food and eat a low residue, low carb, fish and fowl only diet. The recipes in this book tend to be high residue or spicy or high carbs. All of which I cannot eat. So, this book has only 6 recipes I've earmarked. There are more I could use, but they are in the ""Cooking with Steam"" book, which by the way, has more recipes that are friendly to my stomach."
1,"Cute little book, ridiculous prices.","This little book has some interesting recipes, but the prices are outrageous. The book was $18.95 new- there's no reason for anyone to charge more than that. It's definitely being returned."
3,Unique,I heard this on NPR and liked what I heard. Ordered the disk but found the music tedious after listening and too repetitive.
5,Body Back Buddy's: The Best Self Massage Tool,"This product is my new best friend. I LOVE IT.. The only way to describe it is you can give yourself a deep tissue massage. It's unbelievable. I bought 3 for presents and everyone loves it. I walk around with mine on my shoulder for hours, no word of a lie. I love it...."
1,Highway Robbery,5 dollars. 5 dollars for a 3 cent piece of plastic. I'll never buy another Lutron product again.
1,Huge disappointment,"I understand that this concert was recorded thirty years ago, so I was not expecting a brand new, never-before-seen show. However, although one reviewer here referred to this new DVD issue as ""remastered,"" I see no evidence of that at all. It looks like an old VHS recording that has been transferred to DVD and shows all the wear-and-tear of those thirty years. What I had expected was a sharper picture and higher quality sound, but this product does not deliver that. It is grainy and muddy and is a disservice to the artist and the audience."
1,Not Miss Ross on the cover,"This is a DVD touted as Diana Ross Live In Concert, but who is that on the cover? It looks more like Janet Jackson! I think more details should be given so that fans of Miss Ross won't be suckered in by these rip offs. I was given the heads up by someone that purchased this DVD. It was the same concert as a previous release but of very poor quality.Not fair to the fans at all!"
5,Diana Ross At Her Las Vegas Peak!!,"I agree that the quality of this DVD is not up to high definition standards, but the quality is no worse than the original VHS version, which I also own and still play. So for me to have this concert on DVD gets the 5 star rating alone. When I play it on my portable DVD player and use my MP3 earbuds, the sound is amazing! And you can't beat the price. Maybe one day we'll see a remastered crystal clear version, but, for me, this will suffice. Plus ""The Boss"" is one of my favorite Diana Ross releases and this show is loaded with songs from that album."
1,Very Bad Quality reproduction of this amazing show,"Being familiar with this show, and seeing both ""LIVE' and originally on HBO, I was expecting a really good reproduction, Instead I discovered it was of VERY POOR QUALITY. Way to DARK for most of the show you could barely see the picture. I Would NOT recommend this to anyone!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY. until a future version is released that is worthy of your ownership!!"
2,ARE YOU LOOKING FOR THE DEFINITE DIANA ROSS AT CAESAR'S PALACE DVD??,"Well, if you are, this isn't it. The two stars were for the audio quality which wasn't bad at all but the video quality is horrible. I, like the previous reviewer, miss the original opening of the video which showed the Caesar's Palace marquee with DIANA ROSS in huge letters. The video is dark, muddy and even blurry. As a lifelong Diana Ross fan, I was so looking forward to getting this. Imagine my shock when I put it in my DVD player and was subjected to such a shoddy product. I wish Diana would release a pristine copy of this concert as it has always been one of my favorites. She looks fabulous and sounds wonderful. And I also must mention, who the hell is that on the back cover? Is it a secretary form Hudson Street they recruited to try to look like Diana? What a crock!!"
1,Don't Waste Ur Money,MIss Ross is the best in the business and its beyond me why she allows this very poor quality disc to be sold to her public. A very disappointing purchase.
1,Copy of a Brazilian DVD,"This is not planned exactly to be a review, but just an advice to all that this DVD is an exact copy of another one, issued here in Brazil, but also on sale at AMAZON. As I had the Brazilian one, now I have two of a kind! Follows link to same.In Concert"
1,Beware of this DVD,"I bought this DVD from amazom.de, but it's the same version as presented on amazon.com.I payed 15,95, that's 22,65 dollars !The quality is very bad, ok it's a concert from 30 years ago but a little remastering was to much to ask.I already mailed the record company that put this on DVD, this is nothing more than making very easy money.Very bad sound, the Dolby Digital 5.1 is the best (?), the DTS track is very bad.Miss Ross will perform in Holland on october 16, 17 and 18 with a special concert called Symphonica in Rosso, a big concert that's put on stage every year with a different artist (last year it was Lionel Ritchie).Let's hope they put out that DVD on the market very soon so we can have a decent concert DVD."
5,the ultimate tragicc figure,Liela Murray is the ultimate tragic figure and Laura Kasischke paints her with uncanny skill. Art should invade your world and force you to view it differently. This book definitely does that.
5,"Brilliant, A Model Book for Teaching Writing","I often use the opening line of this book as an example in creative and memoir writing classes that I teach of how an author can immediately capture the reader. This book keeps you breathlessly involved:the extraordinary language, its simplicity, the compelling character. A stunning novel, or novelized memoir?"
5,Acoustic Stylee Takes a Unique Voice,"Mike Pinto's first studio recorded albulm is a great mix of Southern California lifestyle and Spanish acoustic roots in his story injected melowdies. Pinto manages to tastfully create a Sublime-esque sound of his own, with his unique vocals and guitar skill. This is a very chill CD and a great addition to your collection if your a fan of acoustic CDs such as Bradly Nowell and Friends, Slightly Stoopid Acoustic Roots, or even Jack Johnson. Im sure you will enjoy this excelent album!"
4,Valuable knowledge to have,"What sets Marc Macyoung apart from many other self-defense experts is this: he teaches you how to avoid fights in the first place. Avoidance and Prevention are common themes that prevail throughout his works. And this book teaches you exactly how to avoid or anticipate confrontations by identifying the potential trouble makers. With his unique style of writing, Animal shares his knowledge in an informative, yet entertaining way. For all those of you who have enjoyed Animal's other works, this is a good book to have. And for those who don't know Marc Macyoung, this book is worth a try."
1,Disappointing,"Dull and way, way too complicated. The complex rules go on and on, and they are impossible to remember. So every time you land on a square, you have to look it up in the rules...is it a Ha Ha? A Ho Ho? A Hee Hee? Group or individual? Joker judges or we judge? etc etc.Our kids like playing anything with us, so the hour or two we spent playing it today was okay. But for $30? Big disappointment and boring. After playing once, it went into the basement to be stored away, and I'll be surprised if they ask for it again."
4,HMMM,"I have to agree about the pricing. Rarely will you find rare Ringware pieces at the prices that he is quoting (even as an estimate). But in 2000, prices have changed a lot since the book was published. Also, many non-rare items are either not pictured or not priced (i.e. HIFIRE mixing bowls, Ring low shakers). On the positive, the pictures for the most part are great and you see things that you might not see in an ordinary antique mall or maybe even EBAY!"
3,more (cow) bowl,"I'm a long way from a Bauer expert (I have 4 bowls and a pitcher), so this is a good introduction. Nevertheless, the book concentrated on ""art"" items rather than everyday kitchen and table items which one is more likely to see in antique shops. More emphasis on bowls might answer questions I have, such as why none of my bowls have the inside rims, or the date of that style. The book is a bit old so prices may be out of date, but provide a ballpark number for the non-pro."
1,No go.,"Did not receive the item I requested. Because of the low cost of the item, I didn't return it."
5,Thank you all so very much !,"I borrowed a VHS copy from the library many years ago.I had since gone back to see if they still had a copy.They do not carry VHS anymore.I had remembered how much i loved this movie,so just had to have it for myself.The VHS copy that recieved is a perfect copy that plays great to my liking.Am so pleased now to have my own copy.Thank you all so very much.Darrell Colby."
5,Wonderful!,This is one of the most heart-wrenching and heart-warming books that I have ever read. I could not put it down.
3,Still Shooting But Still Missing,"4. By Sorrows River by Larry McMurtryThird book in the Berrybinder series, this carries the menagerie to Santa Fe, MN. The book is an easy and interesting read because McMurtry creates such vivid characters and incidents. Unfortunately, he does not have a compelling driving force for the narrative; the characters carry it along in picaresque style. It is rather like being on a raft with them as they flow aimlessly down the river of life. Still, can't wait for the next in the series. As long as Larry churns them out, I'll read. Still looking for the heart of Lonesome Dove."
4,A pleasant entertainment,"Kind of a good humored tongue in cheek yet touching frontier western. This one is book 3 of a tetralogy and I think it is best if one has read the previous books first - Sin Killer being the first book. It's kind of formulaic, there is some heavy handed writing along with characters being added or dropped at a whim. Despite that - I enjoyed it - the story was good, the characters humorous - in all a pleasure to read."
3,Historical Inaccuracy,"Larry McMurtrey books are not great literature (well, maybe with the exception of LONESOME DOVE) but they are a lot of fun to read. I especially enjoy listening to these on books on tape or CD. The Berrybender series is no exception. Many Westerns are written for a male audience but Larry McMurtrey has in Tasmin Berrybender a strong female character with many quirks, supplemented by her sisters and stepmother. However, this last book had me yelling at cassette tape player in my car at the end. Couldn't Larry McMurtrey look in his giant bookstore for a biography of ""Pomp"" Jean Baptiste Charbonneau to learn that Pomp lives until 1866, participates in the California Gold Rush and escorts Mormons across the Rockies? Glaring inaccuracies like this will aggravate readers who like historical fiction but cannot abide this much stretching of the truth. But now I'll wait for the fourth volume in the series, perhaps Pomp isn't really dead and will do an ""X Files"" reappearance."
3,Too much Tasmin,"I'm a big McMurtry fan, but after the first two books of the series I became weary of Tasmin. The pace slows considerably, with her repetitive musings and reflections on ""What am I doiing here?"" I started skipping her chapters with no loss of coherence in the narrative. Her husband Sin Killer is far more interesting."
1,"Book was inscribed, but this was not stated under condition","This book was in good condition, but was inscribed ""To Mom"" etc., on the inside cover page and therefore could not be used as a Xmas present, which was the reason I purchased it. This problem should have been noted in the description always given for used books. but the book is now a waste of my money."
4,Found the best price here!,"I needed new brakes, but being the bargain shopper I am I refused to pay full price. I wanted not only quality, but a discount too! I shopped around both online and in-store and when it came down to it, Amazon offered me the best deal. Not only were the bake pads 30% less than most other retailers there was also a $15 Rebate - Cha-Ching! I ordered both the front and rear pads and they were delivered using the Free Super Saver Shipping in just about 7 days. Luckily I had someone to install them for me on my Trailblazer and so far they work great; no squeaking and they stop on a dime. I highly recommend shopping Amazon when looking for auto parts, this wasn't the first part I've ordered and it won't be my last.Comment"
1,Don't buy anything from these guys----don't find out the hard way,"Please--don't buy from these guys----they have sell horrible, cheap products and have crappy customer service."
2,"Low quality, looks ok from far.","Not a particularly high quality costume, material is thin and some of the edges ragged. It's a knock-off of the John Travolta Saturday Night Fever costume. If I were buying again, I would buy the real thing.The seller is great though and shipped very quickly."
5,Sweet!!!,I won the homecoming decades theme contest at the school where I teach with the costume & wig.
4,Good Costume for the Money,"The costume was good for the price. You can not wear the ""shirt"" alone without the jacket if you get too hot because it really is not a shirt. It is more a halter-like vest. The sizing is very accurate. XL is really an XL. Not a L, like some other costumes I looked at. It looks good on as well. Very happy with this product."
1,awful,"unfinishable - plot was ill-conceived, dialog unrealistic, hero is a MOOCH - living off poverty-stricken heroine and her family - i gave up about half-way. Her other work was really fun but this stuff had very little to recommend. Beware."
2,Probably won't read her work again,"Ok, ladies! I don't know about the rest of you, but I need a strong, smart alpha male in my fantasies! Rein gave in too much, and was just wandered around the story trying to please Anna."
5,Love This Author,This was the first Pamela Britton book I read and she hooked me right away. I love stories the feature a female lead character who isn't of the same social class as the hero. (Think Cinderella). In my opinion Pamela Britton pulled this story off beautifully! I found myself laughing while I read this book and then crying in some places. After I finished I went and ordered two of her other books which I also loved. A new favorite author of mine and one I really recommend.
3,"Decent, but felt let down at the end","I liked the premise, nobleman tossed into the world of the humble masses and forced to get by. I really liked that our hero struggled with his own feelings of inadequacy over his 'slow' mind. I thought that a hero with less than stellar opinions of his intellect was a really different and interesting character trait. I liked the heroine in general, though she didn't really stand out to me in anyway. The grandfather was also an enjoyable addition to to story. But somehow the ending just left me, well, dissatisfied.If you've got spare room on your booklist, try it out."
5,366 Low-Fat Brand-Name Recipes in Minutes,"I have accumulated several low fat, ""healthy"" cookbooks over the years, probably like half the rest of the world. Having owned this one for over five years, it's showing its wear, because it is my favorite! My 14 year old picky eater son begged me to fix the ""Shrimp and Rice Salad with Soy Sauce Dressing"" tonight--and I obliged! My family of four will fight over the leftovers tomorrow! Don't worry about the use of ""Brand Names""--often you can easily substitute other brands with equally good results. The recipes are easy, fast, healthy, and definitely taste good. I highly recommend this cookbook."
3,Too Firm,We bought the soft one. It wasn't really soft. The extra soft was probably the one we should have ordered.
1,Never received it!,"Money gone, no ball. Therefore I cannot give it a good review. Hope your experience is better. The product itself may be worthy of more than one star. I don't know personaly."
4,A must-read for both adults and children,"Many books that receive the Newbery Honors award seem to blend into obscurity in a short time, while their Newbery Medal associates become widely read and praised. Imagine my shock to find that there were no copies of the book at my local bookstore and several large bookstores! Lisle's beautifully written novel is one that must not be overlooked. Children will be intoxicated by the mystery of the elves and Sara Kate's elf-like presence. But there are other issues at the heart of the book: how are those that are different in our society treated, especially the impoverished? What happens to children with parents who are unable to care for them? There are also several pertinent points on the theme of friendship--what makes a real friend and why one must choose them wisely. One step into Sara Kate's world and you'll be hooked. Buy this book and share it with everyone you know!"
3,Good but not Great,"A fiercely poor Sara-Kate claims that elves live in her garden. Hillary chooses to accept the fantasy and the friendship, but at a cost.Despite the Newberry Honour, this is a good, not great book, and lovers of fantasy should note that it is really more about friends than fairies, and it is a relatively dark work, not whimsical or lighthearted. Nonetheless, it's an interesting and enjoyable, if not particularly indelible read.Note: a 3 star ranking from me is actually pretty good; I reserve 4 stars for tremendously good works, and 5 only for the rare few that are or ought to be classic; unfortunately most books published are 2 or less."
1,Yuck blah boo,Although it's been severel years since I read this book I still gag when I hear the title. This could easily be the worst book I've ever read. The ending is horrible and leaves you with no since of hope for either of the main characters. Hillary's parents are both complete nincompoops! One of my friends who read this book ripped it up after reading it and that's exactly how I felt too.
4,Afternoon of the elves,"Afternoon of The ElvesBy:Janet Taylor LisleDo you like stories about magic and mysteries? If so this book is for you!! In Afternoon of The Elves Sara-Kate and Hillary find an elf village in Sara-Kate's back yard. Hillary and Sara-Kate hear about the elves, so they fix their houses when they break. Hillary doesn't know why Sara-Kate cares so much about them, but she soon finds out, and so does her mom. People who like mysteries and magic should read this book. This book is like a puzzle with a thousand pieces. I wished I could never stop reading it. You should definitely read this book!"
5,Quite Enjoyable,"An entertaining book. It's been a couple years since I read it, but I remember enjoying it! It puts an interesting point of view on elves, and I can almost say I'm just like the mysterious girl next-door(Sara-Kate) because of how weird I tend to be, and I don't bother hiding it either! I recomend it, and I hope you like it too."
5,It was Really good,I loved reading this book. I picked up and found it hard to put down. The only thing that I thought was horrible about this book was the end. I hated the ending. But other than that It was a very nice book and I think that it deserves to get 5 stars! =)
1,Deep Downer,"Janet Taylor Lisle hooks you in with a story that evokes the best of popular fantasy with some Pippi Longstocking thrown in. Then she sucker punches you with a depressing dose of misfortune devoid of fantasy and stripped down to a cold, sad version of reality that shocks and confounds. The denouement involves mental illness, neglect and orphaning. For more on this kind of approach to youth literature, check out ""Welcome to Lizard Motel"" by Barbara Feinberg."
2,"Overall - - OK, but rather boring and unrealistic","This book seemed like a DAPHNE'S BOOK wannabe to me. Although I listened to it on tape, and did not read it the ending left me with little hope, and did not seem to tie up any of the plots that it so carelessly began. Although some of the plot twists were interestiong, and overall the book made you wonder, I think this novel is not realistic to how children in these social or economic situations would actually behave."
2,Meh,Not entirely compelling. The plot didn't pull me in or anything and most of the time I was confused more than anything.
5,12 year old daughter loved it,"My 12 year old daughter struggles with reading. She did not want to read it at first, but I made her start and she didn't put it down until she finished it. It is a sad story, but all I can say is, it drew and held the rapt attention of myself and my daughter."
4,12 year old reader from KY,"11 year old, Sara-Kate, and 9 year old, Hillary, find there lives full of magic and suspense as they work on the mysterious elf village. Hillary finds herself walking slowly up the stairs of Sara-Kates house. When she gets there she sees a light flowing from beneath the door. She walks toward the door to find... well you will have to find that out for yourself. Later on in the book Hillary begins to be really good friends with Sara-Kate. They were at a party at Sara-Kate's house when Hillary asked her if she was an elf, but before she could answer there was a knock on the door. This is a wonderful book that teaches you that you can be friends with any one. It doesn't matter how different they are from you. All in all, I recommend this this book to people who believe in fairytales."
5,"Excitement, Emotion, All in one book?","This book I can recommend for most anyone. It's one of my favorites, and I hope everyone that wants to can get a chance to read it. It stars a misfit girl and another girl curious about her behavior. Once she meets this girl she discovers a whole new world: the world of the elves. Join this girl in her new, grand discovery."
5,I liked it alot.,This book was cool. I like when They make a well out of a bottlecap. It is really misterious about the very sick mom and sad when Sarah-Jane has to leave. An imaginative story. I reccomend it.
4,The standard for metal protection.,I hate that it is expensive and doesn't last long so you can't really buy in bulk. The product itself is very good though. I've used this stuff on automotive and other restoration projects and it just works.
4,POR-15,"I have used this product before. We use it as a base coat for a heavy duty trailer, rust about 10% of what we usually get a year."
5,POR-15 IS A GREAT PRODUCT,"POR-15 is a metal restorers dream. Turns rusted metal into a smoooth, impervious, ceramic-like surface. This go around it saved me from having to cut out and replace a rare car floor. Easy to use."
3,Don't forget to read the fine print,I did some research and came up with Por-15 as the best anti-rust product for automobiles. I got mixed results. Only after I applied it to the hood of my car I saw that this product should not be applied to objects in direct sunlight. Before that I used the Por-15 on a battery tray under the hood and it holds up great. The parts on top of the hood I applied are now peeling and turning grey. Not too enthused with only being able to use rustproofing on some parts of the car.
5,Realistic portrait of war,"Well-made Vietnam war movie with ""Dallas"" star Steve Kanaly as a an unconventional but honest major betrayed by his superiors and his firebase left with a unexperienced leader. Written by Outdoors magazine writer Dan Gagliasso and critically acclaimed director Carl Franklin."
5,good book for beginners and switchers,"Since I switched from Windows to iMac I was looking for a book the gives me an overview over the system. This book does an excellent job in doing so. It covers everything you need to know goes into some detail, but not too deep (which also would not be possible in a book like this, otherwise it would be thousands of pages long).I can really recommend this book for people who switch or beginners.(this is basically the the same review I wrote for the Mac OS X - the missing manual ... I think both are very comparable and equally good ... I preferred the layout of the missing manual, but thats just personal preference)"
4,usefull book for reference,"macosx is a piece of cake to learn, this book hoewver covers anything from basic usage to advanced terminal functions. it also presents a wide range of free utilities that can make the use o macosx more interesting!"
2,Not very useful,"I have had this manual for a year, and it's answered very few of my questions. The writing isn't nearly as clear as it could be, but moreover there are a lot of missing topics. Just now I am looking for guidance on uninstalling software, and it's not even mentioned. Earlier today I was looking for help on iTunes, and it couldn't answer my (pretty simple) question on that either. I had Sharon Aker?'s Mac Bible for 0S 9, and it was fantastic. I thought this would be similar, but it's not nearly as good. I hoping to find a better manual."
5,MAC BOOKS,This book is without question THE best source of information for the Mac operating system. It is very clear and allows one to solve just about any problem that may come up - - even on older Macs.
3,A Decent Compilation of Hitchcock's Early Years,"Even though I am a die hard fan of the ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" TV series, I couldn't miss this opportunity to buy this compilation of films ""Alfred Hitchcock-Legacy of Suspense."" I bought it on sale in the Amazon marketplace for 92 cents brand NEW plus shipping (practically for FREE). This compilation even includes a few of Hitchcock's early Silent Films. I could only get myself to watch only one of these Silent Films all the way through to completion though. However, I liked his 1930's non-silent films on this compilation better. However, I still prefer his ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" TV series over these early movies."
5,A Legacy To Mankind - The Deep Hot Biosphere,Absolutely The Deep Hot Biosphere is a precious legacy not only for science but for mankind.Thomas Gold's work can be considered as a light that illuminates our thoughts and lead us to a better understanding of the true nature of hydrocarbons and their evolution on Earth and beyond. One of the important developments is to rethink the true nature of earthquakes that could save lives if the ideas are studied and developed with current technology.
2,Where is the physical proof of Gold's theory?,"In the real world, countless oil wells have already peaked and there is little empirical evidence for Gold's ideas. How will we reach this ""abiotic"" oil & gas when it hasn't been found in commercial quantities with thousands of wells drilled around the world for decades? Is there an abiotic portal hiding in one secret location?Gold's big drilling experiment in Sweden's Siljan Ring turned up nothing conclusive; the hydrocarbons could have been from nearby sedimentary seepage or reactions in the drilling mud itself. Skeptical reviews of Gold's work cite no real evidence for his claims. He was no dummy, but many people become crackpots in later years, or try to force pet theories to match reality.Mr. Gold is no longer alive and the whole topic of abiotic oil is speculative at best, with few other modern proponents. It also creates apathy in people who might otherwise conserve oil instead of wasting it. Then there's the problem of AGW..."
5,Challenging Conventional Dogma,If the theory of Thomas Gold is true - and the evidence is incredibly persuasive - then the implications for climate change etc is massive. This sort of information should be put out publicly for open criticism because the consequences are to large too ignore!
2,MCSE SQL Server 2000 Administration for Dummies,Too many mistakes were made both in the context and CD-ROMs. Why don't they spend more time on quality control and stopping waste our time ?
3,Needs Some Error Checking,"There are too many mistakes in this book. You have to read fairly carefully to not get caught by them. For example, one of the ""Prep Test"" questions for chapter 14 is, ""How do you create a temporary backup device?"". In the answers it refers the reader to the ""Performing Backups"" section, which does not contain the specific answer that they're looking for. This is one example out of many where the text does not prepare you at all for a question.There are also quite a few outright errors in the Prep Tests and Answers sections.The book in general is quite informative, I'm only rating it this low because of the poor quality of the questions and answers -- it's as if they were added as an afterthought. I'm using this to prepare for 70-228, and now I wish I had a better book."
3,not complete,"I almost did not find anything on replication in this book, except for a small lab on how to create a standard publisher and subscriber. Also little info on auditing and troubleshooting, since this is an important part of the exam."
2,Not Quite Enough,"The book doesn't cover all the topics I had on the exam, and what it does cover it does without much depth. That's OK, I know how to use BOL. I never used the practice question in the book so I can't speak to those. You can get by with this book for the exam if you have some practical experience (imagine that!), use the BOL and most importantly (for me at least), a good practice exam."
3,"Good, but not enought","This book explain difficult concepts in a easy way. It is very well organized but lacks of in depth coverage; most T-SQL commands are just covered briefly with no examples at all (Sybex book has more Exercises). I suggest to buy this one with Sybex 70-228 study guide or any other study guide of your choice. This one alone (if you have no previous experience with SQL 2000) will guide you to ""failed"" screen message when you reach the end of the test."
4,Amazing 3D!,"I have got quite a few Walking with Dinosaurs books, and this is one of the better ones - why? Because of the amazing 3-D thing. Warning: The 3-D glasses can be lost easily."
2,Weak,All the sound effects sound the same. The sound quality is poor. Seems like a low budget project.
3,one reason to get this,"i thought i'd mention that John Lennon used this CD for part of Revolution #9, a sound collage that was on The Beatles White Album"
5,Fabulous Book,"As always, Nick Bunick shines with this wonderful book. I just love his insight to the spiritual world. It makes sense to me and that is what makes his books so great."
1,Not my kind of erotica.,"What a terrible excuse for erotica. This book had no tension, no build-up, nothing but one sexual episode after another. It got boring very fast. I wanted to know more about what the main character was really thinking as she found herself slipping into these unusual (for her) situations. Reading this book was about as exciting as drinking a bottle of flat, warm beer. Very badly written."
4,a culinary classic,"This is a new edition of Elizabeth David's 1958 classic. I'm so glad to see it back in print. David's somewhat prolix recipes range in tone from pedantic to stern to confiding--but always interesting and educational. The recipes are heavy for today's cuisine, but they're delicious. I especially rely on her risotto instructions. My favorite recipe is the Cuttlefish Stew."
5,Cute Necklace!!!,Got a lot of compliments when I wear this necklace it is so cute!!! I love it. Buy one feel sexy too!!!
5,Great Introduction to Particle Physics,"I thought this lecture series was a fantastic introduction to particle physics. Like the title reads, this book is intended for people who are NON-PHYSICISTS, i.e. people who aren't interested in buying a physics book, but would like to learn some foundational principles about the world of particle physics. For those people it is a wonderful introductory course. I love how Steven Pollock made particle physics easy to understand by starting at the very beginning and walking you through the evolution of the science. He goes in-depth into atom smashers, each of the individual subatomic particles, and the direction this field of study is moving towards today. He masterfully explains the concepts without dragging too much of the mathematics into it, which creates a learning experience that allows you to catch a glimpse of this complex science without getting overwhelmed by technical jargon. It's definitely a great course for the particle physics hobbyist."
4,This stuffs rocks!,I took a chance on this buy and i'm so glad i did! There's really some amazing playing going on here-- All these songs are beautiful--perfect for a long drive on a summer night --can't wait to hear a full length release from Blanket--It hasn't left my cd changer yet...
4,Great book,"This is a great book for the practicing P.I. Some of the pre-texts are outdated in our new age, but they all are good to get your mind pumping. This book is great to help investigators understand how to create their own pre-texts. I WISH the authors would publish a new version with some new idea's in out modern times.Out of all the books I've ever read about investigations and surveillance (probably close to 100), this is the most straightforward book and takes balls to publish. Finally a book that investigators can relate to.The book loses a star because of spelling and physical quality. I think my staples prinitng paper is less fragile then the cover of the book."
4,lot's of fun,This is well made game for the price. My kids and I play it every weekend before football. You can just have fun or you can actually learn some football moves and formations. Beware though that you can not control the players that well because they don't come with the rotation bases. Those type come with the more expensive set's.
1,Cheap toy & bad shipping practices,We bought this for my son for Christmas. It was shipped without an outer box. My husband and Son arrive home and found the football game on our front porch in plain sight. The Shipper just stuck a shipping label on the outside of the box. Both ends of the package was open. Thanks Amazon for ruining this for our son! I will be returning this item! Its cheap and not worth the money.
3,Not Like They Used to Make Them,"Game is good, but just typical modern-day cheap version of toys that used to be made well. Goal posts broke on setup, and a felt-football?"
4,Henry Lincoln's own story and new discoveries,"Have to disagree with the previous reviewer - maybe not exactly what was expected, but informative and great to find there's something more behind the old Da Vinci Code stuff. The main player here is Henry Lincoln himself who made the original BBC programmes 30 years ago and wrote Holy Blood, Holy Grail - of course if it were not for him, there would be no Da Vinci Code - he's the daddy and this is the original story PLUS what he's been up to in the last 25 years.OK, I perhaps woud have liked a bit more about the Priory of Sion, etc. but that's made up for by the new stuff that Lincoln's discovered since - I haven't seen this new Templar geometry stuff anywhere else - it's quite convicing and spooky.I found it a thought provoking well-made and professionally produced DVD, maybe slow in bits, but there's alot to get your teeth into. Don't get it if you're looking for 'the answer' though - Lincoln seems to be saying ""there isn't one ... yet""."
2,What a disappointment,"I personally found this DVD rather boring. The first one-third pretty much summarized what I already knew from other books and DVDs on this subject. Then Henry Lincoln goes into a rather technical question about the location of Rennes Le Chateau among other places important to this subject, and its relative location to each other.I wish I had saved my money."
3,Much more about geometry/geography than Rennes-le-Chateau,Just be aware: this book is much more about new thoughts about geometry and geography than it is about the Holy Blood-Holy Grail/Rennes-le-Chateau mystery. Louis J Sheehan
5,Very Appealing Yet Again,"I enjoyed this book, mostly because of Moore's style, his way of weaving wit, knowledge, humor, and his sarcasm into a very entertaining but knowledgeable book. Of course, the book's biased, everything's biased nowadays, but the facts ARE the facts and Moore delivers them with a punch! I recommend this book to anyone, even rightists, because it doesn't hurt to look from others' point of views. That sounds so liberal. Anyway, back to the book, it's got a lot of humor and you'll be laughing out loud in between pages, which should be a big plus to many of you out there!"
4,Dude Where is My Country,"Michael Moore is a very talented and unusual writer,he confronts ,celebrities and people in high places with an unbridled passion.His stories are delivered in an always interesting and confronting.Although I am Australian,I take an interest in the great USA and find this booka challenge to us all ,not to be afraid to question or to express your views.An excellent read written in an easy to follow style.Keith Bryan"
5,Moore Right On The Mark,"I read this book while on vacation in August of 2007. Although it was written in 2003, it is amazing how Michael Moore was right on the mark.Moore's critics constantly attack his books & films, but when you look back he is always right. Great book."
1,"Dude, I've found several counties for ya.","Dude, you're a Socialist/Communist/Marxists! Anyone of this persuasion has a choice of countries: Cuba, Laos, Libya, North Korea, The People's Republic of China, or Vietnam. If Mikhail truly wished to inform/educate his readers he should live in one or more of the afore mentioned countries and write of the experience. This book is emotion with no substance...just like the Democratic Party."
1,Bull,"If Moore's book is supported by 'solid research' as some readers pathetically believe, this review is worth a Nobel prize."
1,Bah. This is exactly what we dont need.,"How does Mike Moore think that he's ""contributing to society"" with this garbage? This kind of shock politics is exactly what shouldnt happen in a bi-partisan system. Michael Moore is a pretentious, overblown windbag like so many other liberals - much worse than the conservatives. He needs to stop touting his remarkable ability to complain, and come up with a few ideas about how to make America better."
3,Propaganda,"As an independent, it is somewhat refreshing to see a propagandist from the ""left"" for a change, but I'm still fed up with the tendency of every prominent figure in our media to prefer emotional diatribes to reason. Yes, Moore makes some good points and his viewpoints are needed. However, like O'Reilly, Franken, Limbaugh, Coulter, and the plethora of random Hollywood celebrities (i.e., Schwarzenegger) that abuse their fame, Moore finds it easier to muster self-righteous anger than employ reason to further his agenda. Of course, he's just trying to make a buck. The real blame lies on the shoulders of the attention deficient American people who prefer loud, exciting ""pseudo-news"" to actual un-biased information."
5,WOW amazing research,"Its amazing how much research has been performed to write this book, yet many hard headed conservatives still think its bunk.Wake up!"
2,So what?,"Another day, another rant by Moore. Why do people even bother talking about it? Yeah, yeah, France is so noble in their anti-war stance...Germany too. It has nothing to do with dealings with Saadam does it? No, not at all. They are just smarter and better than us. Germany has a long history of great leaders who make humane decisions. France has always stood up to for what is right, no matter the cost. Liberals good, conservatives bad."
2,Whats wrong with this book....,"Ok. I am an actual democrat. I like Michael Moore as a filmmaker. I usually find his films thought provoking and presented in a well organized manner. So why don't I like this book?Because it's mean and just a mess.I agree with what he is saying and what he is trying to do. However, the points he tries to make turn into a vicious, thoroughly accusatory, and mean. He doesn't use a lot of facts to back it up--he just points the finger and says ""THEY DID THIS!""I like to think Dems have a higher standard and I've largely supported them for NOT sinking to the depths of what the right wing does. This represents pretty much everything I disagree with the right wing for and looking at it just plain as propaganda, its not much better."
1,"Dude, your country is in Uranus.","This stupid white guy (his own racist phrase) is laughing all the way to the bank, with this book of bunk."
1,Wow!! What a pile of crap!!!,"Shocking and deseptively persuasive, Moore's book is an easy read that should delight all those that have the money to buy it. One thing's for sure, after reading Moore's book, you'll wonder why you wasted the money to buy a new book when (according to Moore) you'll barely have enough money in your miserable life to ever buy anything new again. I am constantly amazed by the defeatist opinions expressed by some rich people.I guess our capitalistic society works for them but not for most of us. Should I be thanking Moore for saving me the trouble I would have endured by trying to obtain MY dreams? Is Moore so much more amazing than all of us that we should all lay down our hopes, aspirations, and guns to have our lives spoon-fed to us by the likes of Moore and his ilk. Simply put, this book is poison. Please do not buy this book. If you do read it, PLEASE take it with a grain of salt. Moore's opinions are NOT truthful nor are they at all helpful."
4,Scary because so many people seem to take it seriously,"This is an important book because its popularity illuminates on political views of certain group of people. But this popularity amongst the US voters is also very scary because US is the most powerful country in the world at the moment. Poor research, faulty reasoning and very low ethical standards are just some attributes that describe this book.Because of importance this book deserves five stars. The only bad things is that buying it fills the pockets of the author who clearly does not deserve this."
1,Don't buy this crap...,"Save your money or buy a book from Sean Hannity or Bill O'Reilly. This rubbish isn't worth the pages its printed on, unless you want to wipe yourself with it. Maybe this guy should stick to making movies."
1,Same tired rhetoric,"Considering the amount of media coverage Moore gets, I assumed it was worthy. His ""what, me petty?"" attitude wore on me, and he lacked insight. He rails against all things corporate, successful, Republican, etc.I don't expect him to tear down his political party of choice, but his absolutist views came across as simpleton ramblings.It seems, ironically, he's in it for the quick cash that mocking people with cash seems to bring."
3,Make More Money - Republicans...,"here's how you can make more money: Don't spend your money on this book, allow your liberal neighboor, or relative to buy it. Then borrow it, and read it cover to cover in secrecy. Follow the detailed suggestions, and you will make more money, lots more money!"
1,"Dude, Where's Your Balls???","Another moral lacking liberal, who can't see the real problem, who can only spin other peoples valiant deeds and works, and poke fun at them in books. Provide me a non comical solution to real world problems you fat idiot.My advice to Michael Moore is to grow some BALLS, and realize that inaction can also be a great vice.Sure let an anti-christ like Saddam torture and kill his citizens, while becomming one of the richest men in the world, just let him be, ""Peace Man""...you Hippy."
4,Moore delivers again!,"In his latest book, Michael Moore investigates the disappearance of his spiritual homeland, The Soviet Union. ""Dude, Where's My Country"" lovingly recounts the glory days of the Red Empire and the high standard of living enjoyed by those who experienced it. Moore is especially fond of Stalin, whom he calls ""the most magnanimous leader of modern times.""Of course, Moore can't help but to criticize America's free market economic system as well as the policies of the Bush administration. In doing so, he presents compelling arguments for why America should continue to move toward socialism.A great read for high school students and Bay Area activists!"
1,Am I Missing Something...,"but I didn't find this funny or even on the mark. He makes things up as he goes along and he also seems to be so very mean-spirited. I am neither conservative or liberal, but he didn't seem smart enough to make the point that he wanted to make - he just comes across and bitter and hateful, two things that are never good."
1,propaganda drivel,"Low on facts, high on insinuations and blatant lies.But who needs facts, the author makes more money by spinning tales that his followers want to hear.Perhaps his ego will finally grow big enough that in the next book he will declare that the Earth is really flat, and the view that Earth is round is spread by a conspiracy of white, gun crazed men (members of NRA and republican party, of course). But I am sure that even then he would find plenty of believers :-)"
1,"Dude, This Guy is a Loser","...Moore makes many interesting observations in Dude, Where's My Country,...All in all, Moore makes his points, interjecting them with a bitter humor. He uses too many ad hominem attacks, but the book is worth a read if you want some laughs at the expense of conservatives. Conservatives, of course, are advised to stay away from this book entirely. They won't like it.-"
1,Propaganda anyone?,"Dude, Where's my Country? is presented as an expose of all the evils of George W. Bush, the Republicans, and their corporate co-conspirators. Moore uses his witty conversational style to present multiple conspiracy theories about Bush that Moore feels is neglected by the mainstream media.It is doubtful that this book will actually convince anyone. Those on the left will enjoy Moore's fanning of the flames of Bush hatred, while those of the right will dismiss the entire book because of Moore's blind hatred for Bush and his one-sided presentation of his personal theories as truth.However, this book is not completely without value, it has some interesting theories, but crosses the line into propaganda by presenting a slew of half-truths and outright lies as unquestionable facts. Because of this, after reading Dude, Where's My Country? the intelligent reader will end up asking one main question...Dude, What About the Facts?"
1,Money laundering,"You know, it's so easy making a lot of money whilst decrying the suffering of others. To clarify my point -- if he is truly interested in informing the public, why not do so in a newspaper publication or magazine editorial? No, wholesale profit is what he is looking for here. And he gets it.Congratulations, Mike. I hope your pockets are well-lined with gold on this one..."
1,"Dude, where's brain?",This book was as intelligent as the movie with the like name. You would have to smoke a bowl of pot to think either one has any redeeming value. Don't waste your money.
1,Another piece of garbage from the fatass himself!,"One of the worst novels to be published this year, this book parallels the stupidity of what most idiotic liberals have come to describe as ""eye opening."""
1,"Dude, Where's my refund!","Wow,....not since I looked into a dumpster did I find a more vile load of garbage...okay,....Al Frankens book was just as much trash.. It seems that the real liars try to make themselves believeable by calling everyone else liars, Michael Moore, whom I'm ashamed to say is from Michigan..( kinda like the liberal heroes Dixie Chicks Huh??) should have titled the book,.Dude, where's my intellegence. A good read for Fiction....just don't take any of it seriously. A good book for your Conservative hating, socialist, communist, loving Liberal Friend."
1,Typical Hollywood Jerk,"I wouldn't read this book if it was free. What gives this Hollywood creep any special insight to anything? It turns my stomache just to see it displayed in the bookstore.Try reading ""The Real America"" By Glenn Beck instead, (you'll probably have special order it)."
2,I Suggest other Literature,"Please don't say this is required reading, don't say its filled with facts, don't say it opened my eyes to the world. If you did see any of these things in the book then I would like to reccomend some reading for you-American History Textbook-World History TextbookAnd then follow it up with a text on World Politics and Economics...Obviously if you know somehting about each you can make a good estimate of what Mr. Moore is embellishing.I found it appaling that people can blame Bush for not preventing 9/11 attacks. Let us not forget that under Clinton the WTC had an attempted Terrorist attack fail after the bomb didnt explode in the right place, bombed embassies in Africa, bombed the USS Cole but Clinton did nothing in the ways of acting to prevent or correct the situation. He states that Bush is the worst president ever...Compared to who? Every president has good and bad its just that people are selective in what they want to hear about someone's history"
3,Michael Moore is wearing on me...,"written with Moore's general attitude of ""it's all the GOPs fault"". What he never seems to comprehend is that the entire system is at fault."
5,Read This Book Now!,"I love this book! Every American who cares about real people, real living breathing human beings must read this book. If the bottom 75% of Americans read this book, it would change the world. This book is easy to read, very amusing and at the same time full of imformation about things going on that would make one sick to their stomach. Maybe ignorance is bliss, but when you are ready to banish ignorance, pick up this book, read it all the way through and then register to vote, and head to your neighborhood democratic office to volunteer. I encourage every single person in America making less than $80,000 a year to read this and every person making over that to read it too."
3,Read Frankin First,"Do be smart enough to ignore the 1 and 5 star ratings. There is no way this book deserves either. This book failed to hit the mark of Stupid White Men. It was very breif and low on new content. It had the same whiny feel that the last chaper claims as the liberal downfall. Frankins recent book is a tome compared to this book...higher on content and comedy, as was Moore's previous attempt. It reads like a big book of According-to-Moore and I would prefer information to opinion. Stick with Plast for journalism, Chomsky for hardcore, and Frankin for comic relief in book form ....and Moore can run the movies."
4,"Dude, Where's My Country?","Dude, Where's My Country? Michael Moore is brave enough to ask, and his book shows us just where we are, are we better off, find out in Michael Moore's book. Great read unless you are already in a depressed state, then maybe you just better pass on this book unless you really want to find out what Michael Moore has found out about our country. Like before Michael digs up the real dirt and tells who's to blame for where our country is and where it is heading if we don't take a stand, let Michael Moore show you how you too can be like him and help the country. A must read. Larry Hobson- Author ""The Day Of The Rose"""
3,Good intentions but...,"The point of the book is well-meaning but like 'Bowling for Columbine', Moore tends to skew the ""facts"" in order to prove his points which he shouldn't have to do. Go ahead and read the book but also take the time to research what he's saying because some of his assertations are as ridiculous as the things coming from the right wing side and just plain not true."
3,He's Written Better...,"This is a very informative book. A couple of the chapters I found more offensive than informative. His chapter where he pretends to be God isn't as funny or appropriate as Al Franken's similar bit in ""Lies and the Lying Liars..."" and his whole chapter on why the American Dream is a fantasy I found troubling, offensive and idiotic considering Moore himself has in fact done the very thing he says can't be done. He's gone from rags to riches. Didn't the editor notice this? The books biggest problem however is that it isn't very funny. Moore's career to date has been based on humorously pointing out flaws. This book just lacks a lot of that humor. In the words of Homer Simpson - ""BE MORE FUNNY!!!"""
3,As long as you have an open mind,"I think Michael Moore is dangerous. A sort of left wing Rush Limbaugh. He uses manipulation and tends to lie or embellish a little to make a point, therefore giving conservatives, who tend to be hateful enough, a good reason to pull out the tired stereotypical ""lefties are loonies"" references. If you read this book with an open mind, he does make some good points. Unfortunately they are overshadowed and lost amid a lot of his b.s. It's not productive (as some previous reviewers seem to believe) to point out weight and looks, etc. None of that has anything to do with the writing. And the writing is fine. Just don't buy into all of it because not all of it is true, and with Moore, it is sometimes hard to distinguish."
1,Punked,"Michael Moore is one of the better storytellers out, but that's all he is a storyteller. Most of the facts he sites in his works are made up or manipulated by him. If you are looking for a good fiction book pick this up. This is book is another non fiction work of Michael Moore. Do a little research and see for your self."
1,terrible,"just another way for a liberal to get his words heard about a conservative ""conspiracy"". This guy is not an American. Or should not be considered one, nonetheless."
1,How does he get away with it??,"Moore plays fast and loose with facts and then slams others for doing the same. This guy is amazing. And for all those who think ""Bowling"" is a documentary - use a dictionary. ""Bowling"" is a work of fiction made worse by the subject being a tragedy."
1,Leftys are as bad as the conservtives,Moore obviously learned nothing from the scores of radical Republicans who tried to overthrow Clinton for 8 years. Moore completely distorts truths to try to attack the president of the United States. He's nothing more than the Ken Starr of this decade.. I expected more from this guy but this book is a pack of lies.
1,"A Class ""A"" Hypocrite","During the Clinton years, we heard little or nothing from this guy. Now that we have a Republican in office, Moore is making millions. And it's this Republican Administration that he calls ""hypocritical.""He has sold more books and movies under the very admistrations he has criticized. The first example of this hypocrasy was under the Reagan administration of the 1980s.At the time this book hit the shelves, arguments against the war in Iraq were already showing themselves to be false. But some people will never believe the truth. Scary."
1,"Not a viewpoint, BUT a revolting display of a Traitor!!!","People like this don't deserve to voice an opinion as with any traitorus person in our country...Having a different view point or a sensable debate is what America stands for which by coming from a free society "" these "" Haters don't respect or defend but rather to undermine this great nation with lies and deceet and trechery which is all this book is for!!! When our country finally stand against these inner "" FOWS"", then we will finally be able to stand together and not be devided as Michael Moore and people just like him are trying to do in voice and writings!"
1,Moore is the big liar.,"This book confirms that Michael Moore just hates Bush and conservatives. He is just throwing anything to smear Bush and conseratives hoping many Americans buy his lies. I guess he is succeding doing that. He fabricated many things in Bowling for Columbine and he does same thing here. What we need is not propaganda from the radical lefts or rights, but truth and facts. It is very hard to find books that stick to the facts and wishing this country to do well. Moore and his followers should be ashamed of themselves. Moore should be irrelevent as his thinking doesn't help our society to do better, actually he is making it worse."
1,Utter and Total Nonsense,"Moore mindless drivel from the angry and misguided film-maker known as Michael Moore.For those who want of the same angry and has harsh words for George W. Bush the war in Iraq, the collapse of Enron etc et al, this is the book for you.Other books are a better use of one's time."
1,Michael Moore-on again?,"There are only two things wrong with this book, the style and the content. After all, what else is there?"
1,"Mindless Rants, Unfounded Propoganda","Couldn't finish this book as it was so incredibly trite. Filled with exaggeration and outright fabrication, I can't imagine who gave it 5 stars."
1,Inside my Bubble,"It is amazing in our country today that we can read, and give credence to one man's internal struggle to reconcile aspects of his life. Where are the statesmen? Thomas Paine who wrote so movingly and credibly in support of the cause of freedom during our Revolutionary War was stating arguments that were eloquent in their passion - and well-reasoned. Michael Moore is nothing more than a guy with a huge grudge - he sees the glass half empty - and yet we listen to him - it's like listening to the most manic guy on campus hold court in the frat house with his energized diatribes - and of course we find this entertaining. But lend credence to this?? Actually believe Moore's delusionary reasoning is evidence of a skilled historian??? what has happened to this country?? Sure, have an opinion - but to publish and give respect to the frat boy's tirades is foolishness on our part - let's grow up."
1,"What will it be Michael, humor or facts?","Moore wants his writings to be regarded as facts, but continues to tell critics that they have no case -- since he is writing humor.Do yourself a favor and read this book for humor, and not any factual content (because there isn't any)."
2,"Dude, Where's Your Head???","Michael Moore is funny. He does deserve credit for humor. You can get a good laugh regardless of what your political leanings are. Having said that:I was surprised at the overly simplistic arguments. I was really expecting ""Moore."" Anyone with some background in history and foreign policy over the last 50 years can EASILY sift through the errors in Michael Moore's logic (or lack of). Not much to challenge the concervative mind.After you read this you will be thankful that Michael Moore is a Hollywood actor and NOT an elected official."
1,no no no,"Michael Moore is paranoid, narcissistic, selfish, a complete hypocrite, and a liar. He completely manipulates facts, misuses information, and downright lies. If you blindly trust his work you are supporting a man who seeks to satisfy only one agenda -- his own.How many of you, like me at the time, after watching his movie Bowling for Columbine wanted to personally go to Charlton Heston's home and beat him into the ground? Well, if so, you are totally in the wrong. There are bountiful discrepancies in the documentary, so much that it renders the whole thing complete bunk. That is but one in his overall repertoire of totally misleading crap. If you want the real picture of Moore's self-promoting, loaded-with-junk works, read the book Michael Moore Is a Big Fat Stupid White Man by David T. Hardy and Jason Clarke. Take it from me, a former Michael Moore fan . . . he's not worth the paper he wipes with."
1,"Dude, I'm a hypocrite","Moore makes a living out of blasting the very country that has made him a multi-millionare and has given him the luxury to publish books, make films and eat ample amounts of food. Is it just me, or do you see a paradox?"
1,A must read for concerned Conservatives,"This is a definite read for all conservatives. After reading this unsupported and extremely poorly written book(and I use the word book loosely) conservatives will understand why Democrats are so successful with attracting the uneducated. Only the totally uninformed and blind would even give a proven loser like Moore the time of day. If you are going to read this I recommend you check it out of your local library and not line this oaf's pockets by purchasing this book. If liberals are so environmentally friendly, why are we killing trees to print this completely unbased antirepublican propaganda? Makes an individual really wonder who the hypocrites really are???"
1,Grow Up,"Instead of whining and ""backing up"" your opinions presented as fact, why just admit that you're enjoying using your outlandishness for monetary gain. If you actually believe the things you say, Mr. Moore, then you're in an altered state of reality."
1,"Dude, Where are your facts?","I have read this book and I returned it because Michael did not offer and evidence to the veracity of his charges. If you think and read for yourself, don't waste your time on this book.I am a non-partisan independent and neither my wife, a Clinton Democrat, could stomach the misleading statements and outright misrepresentations of this book. This shpuld be more appropriately categorized as non-fiction."
1,Take a trip out to middle America.........,"I find it interesting that so many people are writing negative things about President Bush and his stand to fight terror. Is it possible that the extreme left in the Democratic Party is supporting these authors either directly or by buying large numbers of their books to try and put their agenda up as being the only ""correct"" interpertation in America? Enron and the dot com stock market was forstered under the Clinton administration, but it was the Bush administration that finally started to put the illegal dealings out in the open. I live in a big city, but am glad to vacation in the middle of the country where many real Americans live. America is not only Hollywood and New York. Mr. Moore needs to get out more - perhaps ""Stupid White Men"" was his autobiography."
2,Phony Opposition,"Michael Moore and Bill O'Reilly are two sides of the same coin. Both are a pair of media circus clowns who take your money by debating a non-existant left-right dicotomy. In the meantime, they and their publishers get rich, nothing changes for the working class, and politicians continue to serve those who pay to get them elected."
2,"Preachy, and over the top ..","I have a whole shelf of books like this but found this too preachy and in you face, and now I'm hearing alot of the facts are plain wrong. Like alot of his work it starts great but you find yourself wondering where it went wrong half way through. There are better books out there, it reminds me of 'For Dummies...' series."
1,Just plain angry,"Typical Moore. Make a few points, and ramble about how things are going down the toilet, and of course, it is everyone's fault from the people in positions of power to the people who put them there. Of course, everyone but him and people like him. I tried to make it through the book, but about a third of the way through it, I just could not go one more page. Personally, I hope things keep going the way they are, otherwise this no talent hack will be unemployed."
1,"Dude, Where's my facts","I would give this book five stars if it were in the science fiction section. But Mr.Moore still has not learned to tell the truth since his early days of Roger and Me, thats all from this Neo-Con."
1,Crammed and Confused,"The book is too crammed full of issues and too pre-occupied with 'playground-humor' to be of any real value. It fails to give adequate defense of it's many conjectures. Though, admittedly, some would be difficult to defend even if given adequate attention. Furthermore, it is too agressive and too divisive, hinging on a number of false presuppositions."
4,Very Truthful Yet Biased,"This is a book that is very correct in many of its facts, and exposes some secrets about the President we do not want to know.This book is a funny read, very enjoyable at some parts, yet sometimes its hard to discern fact from sarcarsm, as he uses sarcasm at least once a page.The book is very obviously, very biased. I mean, any book about current politics is biased, because it is supposed to normally have a agenda or do somthing.This is a book i would recommened to people who want to know about current politics in the USA, but should also balance it with some investigation of their own if they want."
5,A Good book.... no matter what some people say....,I had a fun time reading this and I especially enjoyed the chapters comparing democrats to republicans and explaining how the majority of American people are liberal.
3,Bush is a shady one,"Not all of Mr. Moore's facts are correct...so I do not agree with everything he writes in this book. However, I am disgusted when I read all these posts that claim that Moore is the liar and Mr. Bush and his administration are perfectly fine. Guess what? That is ridiculous. It has also interested me to see that all the people that detest this book are so narrow-minded. People call him a socialist and everything else their little hick minds can think of. I dislike Bush and his administration and even though this isn't entirely true...I like the message conveyed through the text. Get Bush out of there!"
4,Upcoming Election Primer,"You gotta love the guy for speaking his mind! Moore tackles Bush country post 9/11, with his razor sharp wit and hilarious commentary.What I wonder is how anyone who reads this book would ever vote for Bush in the next election. Beyond the war in Iraq, Moore's accounting of Bush's relationship with Ken Lay of Enron would be enough to want to boot him back to Texas.Some points are outdated just by new information,like his writing that Jessica Lynch was treated hospitably while in captivity, when we now know she was raped.Overall this is a thorough primer for people unhappy with the direction of the country, the war, and what our leaders are telling us is true. Have they found the weapons of mass destruction yet? Wasn't that why we were over there in the first place?"
5,Refreshing Truth,"After being flooded with right-wing books and a media that is either right-wing (FOX news) or spineless (most of the rest), it is refreshing to have books such as Michael Moore's that speak up against this false patriotic fascism that appears to be taking over our country. Moore helps liberals realize that we are not some small minority, but rather that our values are in fact shared by the majority of Americans."
5,You have to read this book!,"This book is amazing! It reveals the truth about September 11th: who REALLY did it, and why. This book isn't as good as Michael Moore's prequel, Stupid White Men, but still definitely worth reading!"
4,Blind rage,I hate Bush and what he is doing to our country but I felt like this was written in a blind rage. It was a little too much for me and I had to keep putting it down.Then of course if you are not in a blind rage then maybe you are not paying attention.
4,A voice of reason in dark times,"Again, Moore proves himself to be entertaining while simultaneously politically provacative and persuasive. The most impressive facet of the book is its copious footnoting and endnoting. Unlike some of his conservative counterparts, Moore seems to be doing his homework. I will admit that, in places, Moore's rhetoric gets too thick, something I've found in his movies as well. Overall though, I can only hope that the quality and subject matter of this fine book will somehow rub on the American public, as well as a blind Congressional body. I have a feeling though, that pervasive (and nonexistent) ""liberal"" media will do all it can to quell Mr. Moore once again."
5,What the Founding Fathers have to say on the issue,Dissent is the highest form of patriotism.-Thomas Jefferson
5,For the thinking American,"This is a must read as we only get 1% of the story behind why we are hated all over the world, while the government and the media conceal 99%. Many employers ask you to think out the box...well this is a first step."
1,Hey Dude - You're Lost In The 60's,"Moore's book is a regurgitation of 1960's radical left wing liberalism. Moore seems to feel the need to justify his new-found riches before his radical friends by bashing conservatives and moderates with a delight and style reminiscent of 1960's radical ""thinkers"" - if we do not have the facts to support our ideas and arguments, we will manufacture them! He thinks he atones for being a rich man now by vomiting up the rhetoric of Jane Fonda, and company and spewing the distasteful bile over the American public. Save yourself $20.00 (I did - I borrowed the book from a woman who really is lost in the 60's - a feminist. LMAO!) Initially, I thought Moore was on track with his seven questions of George Bush. Unfortunately, he did not stay on track with the questions, diverging into the 60's radical political diatribe. That old farm adage remains true - the cream rises to the top and the sh*it sinks to the bottom - only bottom feeders will get anything out of this book."
5,Bravo Lilorphanannie,"I haven't read this book yet, but am purchasing today. Found the reviews interesting. Kudos to the reviewer mentioned above regarding the appalling spelling errors (I mean really, dymensia?) But I digress, just wanted to say that this book must have some value if it creates such great discussion. It doesn't matter if you agree with Mr. Moore or not, obviously he's given you something to think about."
3,Arguing on Amazon Reviews is like...,"Running in the Special Olympics! No matter who wins you're still retarded!I've found that the Star ratings are by and large useless when it comes to purchasing books in the political genre. The majority of ""commie pinkos"" are going to give it 5 stars and all ""right winged zealots"" are going to give it 1 star. **Yawn** Nothing new here.A great man once asked: ""Can't we all just get along?"" Alas, Rodney, we're not even close."
3,I'd have given a 1/2 higer but...,"I like Michael Moore; I've liked his past work. This book seemed more like a bratty child ticked off that things didn't go his way. More concerned with point the evil finger at Bush (who may actually deserve it) than showing how we as 'the people' can fix the problem.C'mon Mike, time to put down the cheeseburger or vodka or whatever it was you were consuming when you wrote this and snap out of this funk."
2,"He gets points for style, zero for integrity","PLEASE buy ""Michael Moore Is a Big Fat Stupid White Man"" instead of this book and skip ""Fahrenheit 9/11."" Yes, Moore makes some humorous points about where liberals (and conservatives) have gone wrong, and yes, if he means this book to be a total assault weapon against Bush, he succeeds. But his total disregard for his audience's intelligence and his endless whining about being booed by the Hollywood amoral Brain Trust spoil any good in this book.Although Mr. Moore is entitled to his opinion and the last time I checked, this is a free country, Mr. Moore is an intellectual coward who got trounced by Bill O'Reilly AND uber-left Vanity Fair critic Christopher Hitchens. Not only that, according to reports, Mr. Union refused to pay the writers on his show ""TV Nation"" WGA minimums. (RADAR Magazine, premiere issue.) Dude, where's your integrity?"
3,Moore can do better,"Coming as it did on the heels of ""Stupid White Men"" and ""Bowling for Columbine,"" Moore's latest, ""Dude, Where's My Country"" feels rushed and a bit redundant. Moore's wit isn't as sharp as it was in ""Stupid White Men,"" and with Al Franken's ""Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them"" released prior to ""Dude,"" Moore's book just doesn't compare. That not to say it's a bad read, it's more a matter of timing. Had Moore released this book this year, and devoted more time to the war in Iraq, I think Moore's words would have been more relevant and had more of an impact. Perhaps when the paperback edition is released, he'll revise it with more commentary on the events in Iraq. Until then, I'd recommend ""Stupid White Men"" instead."
1,Overrated and unsophisticated drivel,"I found this book to be substandard in writing and content. While I have enjoyed other works from this author, this book is a complete waste of time. I bought it out of my interest in Politics which the writings of Greg Palast awakened within me. If you have read any of his writings and enjoyed them then stay away from this drivel by Michael Moore. I suggest watching his movies instead.If you get a chance to peak inside the book, I suggest reading the chapter in which he recounts a dream he has with his great great grandaughter and how little sense this makes in the book. One expects controversy from the content Michael Moore uses not from the lack of substance which this book clearly lacks.Honestly speaking, I found reading this book the equivalent of watching Battlefield Earth. Lame."
1,Amusing,"Ignorance is bliss and that pretty much explains why this book sells. People believe anything that is published. No facts, pure bias and opinion. I read two chapters and sold the book on ebay. Obviously i'm not a pure unquestioned right-winger since I bought the book. I believe in facts and research, not opinion. The book pinpoints and streamlines the typical media bias, brainwashing and filtering of facts. If you are a braindead, DON'T-HAVE-MY-OWN-OPINION dopey liberal, you'll enjoy the book. If you want to waste your money go ahead, you have my blessings."
1,This is Socialism,This guy is a socialist. He hates the free market system. He would rather see higher taxes and more welfare programs. If you think this works just look at France's economy. The reason why this country is strong is because of our free market system not in spite of it. Enginuity should be rewarded not regulated and taxed to death. Get a clue or take a econ class if you agree with this guy. The problem with liberals is they have absolutely no idea how the economy works.
2,Vocabulary,"Even in this liberal part of the Country, Mr. Moores views are not well thought of. His comments about the President, as well as most of his views are based on paranoia and lies that he is able to perpetuate by selling them in books and movies with a slight spin here and there... as was really obvious in the ""documentary"" he did about the Columbine Shooting. He is a master of playing off others tragidy, which is sick to begin with. He belongs right where he is, in the media, where nothing is real. Give him your money by buying this book, it is entertaining, although untruthful throughout, but at least it will allow you some bathroom reading and, if you pay attention and do some research, you will see that the book has no basis in truth."
1,More Hogwash From The Left's Biggest Publicity Hog,"The author was lucky to get one star from me. It was a laughable read to say the least (or most). Thankfully, no matter how hard they try, this great country of ours isn't being paralyzed by ultra-left propaganda-spewing hatemongers like this heap of cowardice. He may be large and loud, but it's surprisingly easy to see through Michael Moore and his fettered agenda. Only simple-thinkers will get reeled in.Pick up a copy of Bill O'Reilly's ""Who's Looking Out For You?"" for a better picture of what's REALLY shaking in America in the early 21st Century."
1,Openmided,"I read this book and one thought came to my mind, how did this guy get a book deal. This book is poorly Written and contains many facts that can be found false by a simple google search or a search in any leading news organization.The only people that would like this book would be people who are total left wing nuts, who believe everything that is spoon fed to them. Coming from a democrat i cant believe this guy is a voice for my party. I will not vote democrat i will be voting libertarian."
1,"love it or leave it, pal","Irregardless of what you think of the president or his policies, a modicum of respect is deserved by the office and for the men and women who volunteer in the armed forces to fight for the freedoms of people like Michael Moore.The country he wants to live in is called Canada."
1,1 star - and that's being generous!,"Michael Moore, here are a few words of advice: Take a shower, lose some weight, shave once in a while, and, most importantly, stop writing stupid books and making fallacious movies.To everyone else: For a better read, pick up something by someone who hasn't been brainwashed. And maybe listen to a Led Zep CD or something! Then watch the O'Reilly Factor and FoxNews. Just my advice"
1,This book sucks!,I could go on and on about how bad this book is. The author is obviously not qualified to write about anything. He is a total idiot and not worth the time.
1,Can't believe anyone listens to this guy!,"Micheal Moore is a miserable filmaker (his one venture into ""fiction"" filmaking was a horrible movie called ""Canadian Bacon"" and it was a huge bomb)and an even worse author. He distorts facts and truths to fit his twisted version of what is happening in the US and abroad. His arguements and views are so skewed that it is I wonder if anyone actually listens to him or if they just buy his ""work"" because they share hating Bush with Moore.Moore ignores anything the left does wrong, any lies they have made, bad policy decisions they have made (and make), ignores anything good done by Bush and any other official of the right, and focuses totally on the negatives. This is the guy who thought we should have done nothing after 9/11. He thought we were ""war-mongering"" by going after Al-Quaida in Afghanistan.Don't buy this book and support this idiot.Get Sean Hannity's book instead. Makes a lot more sense as far as I am concerned."
1,I found Michael Moore's country!,"It's off the coast of Florida, though el Presidente-for-life Castro might be a little bit too right-wing for Moore."
1,Easy question to answer,"""Dude, Where's My Country?"" asks Michael Moore.""Canada,"" I say.Hit the road, Mike, and don't ya come back no more."
1,"Want to support terrorism? If so, buy this book!",Michael Moore's crew is now accepting money from and working with Hezbollah to show his new movie in the Middle East. What a patriot! Do we really need to support someone who works with a known terrorist group?
2,A response to another review.,"I have not read this book, so perhaps I ought to keep my mouth shut, but I was irked by an earlier review. First, I should explain that I am a liberal, but very moderate. I don't particularly care for Moore, mainly because, as was said in other reviews, he is inarticulate and looking for a fight.On to my point: to the reviewer who, well, scolded other reviewers who disliked the book, and said that they only disliked it because they were conservatives and asked why such people read the book in the first place... It was perhaps because these conservatives you scold might be openminded and willing to try to see the other side of the issues. You are obviously a liberal and probably see yourself as open-minded, so why is it so bad that someone on the other side of the issues be that way as well?"
1,unreadable,"look, I was given this as a birthday present, because all my friends know that I really respect his movies and have cited the show he did about running a ficus against terminal incumbents as one of the funniest and most right-on things I've ever seen. Yet I couldn't get past page 10. I didn't check his facts nor did I care to, because honestly his tone was so off the wall that it made the book unbearable. I am on his side and I still felt like the pages were screeching at me hysterically and yelling at me as if I were stupid, despite the fact that he couldn't maintain a consisten argument even over as short a span as two pages without getting into contradictions. honestly, don't waste your time, there are much better books out there to whet your anger with usefull information."
5,Wake Up!!!!!!!!,"I read this today after having got it from a dear American Kentucky woman friend who got it as a Xmas present from her 21 year old daughter.My wife looked at me and said you are rather ""prickly today"" like I had been in the rosebush or blackberry thorns.I kept thinking non-spiritual materialism.Go to church on SUndays, read the bible and then bomb the crap out of Iraq since you can't find Osama.I think Michael has a good heart and a penetrating mind.Anyone who doesn't consider it in its entirety before passing opinion should read Gerge Orwell's 1984. Because that is where we are."
4,This book has its flaws.,"To a large degree this is a very good book, I'm sure the other reviews cover everything that I could say, however a few chapters were slightly disappointing. (leading me to give the book 4 stars)In one chapter Moore pretends to be god, (but its obviously Moore, he uses the exact same language). In another he describes a dream, well a dialogue between him and his great granddaughter in the future. These chapters were painful to read, so I just skipped them. There are a few other times when the book goes a bit awry, however generally the book is a very good read..This book is based on the premise that Bush needs to go. Indeed, Moore makes a very good case. The book concludes by urging the reader help dethrone Bush in 2004. A cause which few who read this book would call unworthy.Regardless of politics, I think that this book is a must read for all Americans. I highly recommend it to any Moore fan."
4,"Great, except a few weird chapters","This book was really good. But to be honest, it did not blow my mind. It was great to see all I knew was true confired with solid facts however.One part I didn't really enjoy was his ""dream"" he had about 50 years in the future. Basically that was ten pages of rambling dedicated to two sentences:""Hydrogren energy is a joke.""and""We rely on oil too much.""but it was really great and he has a good sense of humor.I wish he'd realize that Libertarians could be his allies, but he only mentions the Greens."
4,A direct hit!,"Judging the content of the negative reviews, it appears that Michael Moore has scored a direct hit. This is evident by general, as opposed to specific, claims of incredulity and the ad hominem attacks. Read the book. If the facts are wrong, educate us all by sharing them.Bush may be the most devisive president in our country's history He has gotten a free ride from the press because they thought he was several bricks short of a load and harmless. Clearly, that is not the case. If everyone had read Shrub by Molly Ivans, Bush would never had been in a position to be appointed president. But the press held facts back from the public until it was too late.One star is off because Dude is part entertainment and part educational and a mainstream reader. If you want to read something more scary about Bush, Ivan's Bushwacked will keep you up at nights."
3,P J O'Rourke does it better...,As a classical liberal (freedom before equality) I read this book for a laugh and can recommend it for that (he's much funnier than Chomsky but not as funny as O'Rourke). For those of a modern liberal bent (equality before freedom) looking for a cause (clue) you'll not find it here - it's the same old idiotarianism that makes the job of those who run the world much easier...
4,Another wake-up call from the King of Wake-Up Calls,"First and foremost - great book - should be required in every high school civics class. This book will most likely polarize a great number of Americans - for instance, those that believe that Mr. Bush can do no wrong will fight tooth and nail to preserve their peace and status quo in our current climate of fear (hence the negative reviews on this site), while others will use the truth to compel their feelings and tell others. Don't jus read this book -- read it and tell others -- but tell them to search the truth too -- they'll fing Mr. Moore - not Mr. Bush - is right."
4,Left of splinter,"aspires to the level of TSOG by Robert Anton Wilson, or Kingdom of Fear by Hunter S. Thompson, capturing the healthy cynicism many of us have developed over the past few years with humor and a nice dose of combative sensationalism (to match the chosen weapons of mass deception from the ""Right."")When the hypocritical, sinister likes of Bill O'Reilley and Rush Limbaugh threaten to usurp the last remnants of critical thought right out of our God blessed American brains, along comes a Franken or a Moore to refreshingly restore balance. Call it Yin Yang politics. It ain't perfect, but it's a lot of fun. Opposing sides duking it out to stimulate an economy left floundering by Enron greedsters and equally demonic bureaucrats.Hail to the Thief."
4,My kind of Liberal,"I enjoyed this book for a number of reasons. The first being that despite Moore's obvious leavining to the left, he allows the reader to make up his/her own mind. He doesn't try to force his political opinions using biased words or lies. He simply presents the facts, and obviously tries to persuade the reader to believe what he is saying. His intentions are honest. Even though the reader may not be a liberal, they can at least respect Moore's honesty. The second reason why I enjoyed this book is because Moore appeals to my generation through his diction. Throughout the book, he uses simple wording. This definitely appeals to me and my generation. What also helps is that often times, Moore uses words and phrases which are so hilarious, one cannot help but laugh out loud for a good reason."
5,Yet another excellent book by Michael Moore,"Very well written, engaging, and WELL documented. He certainly supports his assertations with documentation, much of it coming from mainstream press. The only chapter that was a little over the top, was the one in which he had the apparent ""voice of God"" speaking. Other than that, I highly recommend this book to those who are looking for alternative views, other than what is heard on the predominately Neo-Conservative mainstream media. Fans of Limbaugh, Coulter, and O'Reilly: run Forrest!"
3,Great book...BUT...,"..why is it that Moore's own website design is OUTSOURCED to a CANADIAN COMPANY and hosting is OUTSOURCED THERE AS WELL?? Kinda hypocritcal, doncha think? I wish he'd address this report on Drudge, but so far he remains silent..."
4,View from the 'coalition of the willing',"While it has to be said that this book fails to better 'Stupid White Men' (to be fair that would be an impossible task) Moore continues his probe into American political and social affairs at a time where such investigations are so dearly needed. You only have to look at the those giving the one star reports and their (incredible bias and idiotic)responses to grasp why such books are necessary. While I do not agree with all Moore has to say, he highlights numerous injustices and crimes that affects and enrage those who are not CEOs, have millions in the bank and have Daddy to thank for being the President. Sadly, it seems, those who refuse to see that being critical of the government isn't the same as being a traitor are still going to use the most ridiculous arguements which only highlights their idiocy."
5,"Pure facts, no B.S.",Had Micahel Moore been born during biblical times he would have been considered a prophet. The world is a better place for having you buddy. Thanks for opening our eyes!
5,The Fantastic Truth,"Michael Moore is doing what every proud American should be doing. That would be questioning the manner in which their president and government is running the country. Also, he is asking how this gov't is representing the US to the rest of the world.All those who bash Moore as a liar, remember this. EVERY SINGLE statement he makes in his book, no matter how outlandish and far fetched it may seem, they are all supported with corroborating articles/documents. All of Moore's statements are proven to be true! You can decry him all you want, but hiding from the truth is plain ridiculous."
3,Hmmm OK,"Michael Moore means well but when all's said and done he's a better director then writer.Much of what Moore says is right on, from Americas irrational insistance that Horatio Alger events really happen everyday to the many problems with the Iraq war. The main problem is his points are somewhat reduced by occational bouts of false reasoning. For instance trying to creat a direct link between Osama and Bush via the bin Ladin family is quite difficult. Why? Because Osama has some were in the range of 50 brothers and sisters and go knows how many other relitives. It is quite possible for Bush to have relations with some bin Ladins and Osama others without them having a direct link.Oh and he stole material from Al Fraken.All in all this book isn't that bad but there are much better anti-shrub books out."
1,"This Book Should Be Titled, ""Dude, I Hate My Country""","You know, I tried to read this blatently liberal biased book with an open mind. But anyone who has the slightest bit of common sense (anyone who believed BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE was a true documentary is exempt from reading on further)or basic powers of observation can't help but be offended by this pathetic attempt of literary enlightenment. This Socialists' deep hatred for his paranoid idealogy of the Republican party, the Bush Administration and anyone related to it, seeps through practically every chapter. I challenge anyone to confirm the facts and statements in this book. You will find out, as I did that some people, or authors, will say anything inflamatory to sell a book or make a buck. If this joker could make a buck off of screaming FIRE in a crowded movie theatre, he would and then he'd figure out a way to blame the U.S. and President Bush. Don't waste your time with this one."
2,"""Stupid White Men - Part Two""","This is not a book, properly; it's more like an essay, sort like that.I liked ""Stupid White Men"" a lot. I think by now it's becoming clearer and clearer who are the guys who are turning our lives into living nightmares of fear and hatred. But in this new book, I hardly found any new ""evidence"" of this that was not already portrayed in ""SWM"".And that's the problem with this book. Ok, it serves a ""cause"", the cause of barking even louder against the Bush administration and corporative America. But Moore seems obssessed and enraged and full of hate exactly like the conservatives he despises so much. In doing so, the book became an extremely displeasant journey, with arid writing and not an inch of SWM freshness and cohesion."
1,I didn't like it,"Polotics is one of those things you either disagree or you agree with. I found myself in the place of not liking with Michael Moore's book Dude, Where's My Country. I found him to be hypocritical just like the people he bashes. Polotics is something you have to take a side with and mine is not with Moore. I'm Libertarian and frankly can't stand him and other political critics. It's always about their opinion and their is no debate. Liberals will like this book. Republicans won't. It's as simple as that and I didn't like it."
4,Take another look,"Although Michael Moore uses an approach that is not easy to accept, his book is an interesting and important reading. He points out a very disturbing and real current that has been influencing people's lives not only in the US, but in the world. Regardless of how you treat his style, the book is very good in a sense that it calls you to think critically about what is happening around us. It calls a reader with an open mind to look outside the window and see what is really happening to our country and the American Dream. This book is not going to convince those who only see world in black and white or those whose political convictions became a sort of religious belief. This book needs a thinking, intelligent and open-minded reader. Michael Moore is very direct and honest and this outweighs any challenges in style and writing you may find."
2,Two of a kind,"I know that Americans have a problem with the concept of irony, so here's a hint. The contribution below from Idaho (""DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!"") is almost certainly an attempt at irony. The writer is a fully paid-up Moore fan, pretending to be a Coulter fan, pretending to be ...Aw, heck, now you're really confused. You voted against him because he only gave it 1 star, and now it turns out that he's an independent-minded, non-conformist liberal just like you. Or you voted for him, and it turns out that he's just another pinko.What should concern you, but doesn't, is the febrile political climate that makes gurus out of the likes of Moore and Coulter. They are two sides of the same coin. They are laughing all the way to the bank, but you go on paying them. Please! take them both with a sackful of salt.P.S. Einstein was a genius. Russell and Wittgenstein possibly were. Coulter and Moore aren't."
1,Fictitious Book from a Fictitious Man,"C-R-A-P! He films liberal propaganda and calls it a documentary. He writes another book full of lies and calls it the truth. Did anyone read the book description - I'd say Moore was comparing himself to Christ if he wasn't an anti-religion zealot. Moore is a shining example of the infectious, communist waste ruining this country and this book is his pamphlet for furthering the decline of humanity. Don't buy."
1,"Great if true, unfortunately it's not","Just like his movie, this book takes half truths and tries to make them into a convincing rant to get people to think the same way the author does. His movie used cut scenes and words used out of context to try to mislead. This book does the same even more obviously. It should be listed as fiction. The sad part is that someone might actually believe this fiction if they do not have personal experience with the material presented, just as his fictitious movie."
2,Liberal...BIG time,"I am a Clinton-loving, big word-using, New England-living, Gore-voting, recount-obsessing LIBERAL and even I couldn't make it through this book. It's condescending at best and boring at worst. We Americans are not stupid yet he treats us as such. He drones on and on and on about Bush and the war through the whole book...or at least what I read of it, which was a little over half. Save your money or buy James Carville's books instead. Viva la CLINTON!!"
5,Moore is brilliant again,"I agree with those who say that anyone accusing Moore of not writing the facts is full of it. I have spent the past two months working on an anti-Bush book, and virtually everything I found confirms what Moore says in ""Dude"".There are very serious questions about what happened both before and after 9-11 that the Bush administration is refusing to answer. Frankly, I think that Moore does not go far enough inindicting the Bush administration for their crimes.The entire Bush family is one virtual criminal enterprise, from Prescott to the present, and it is deeply disturbing that such people have their hands ILLEGALLY on the levers of power.Aside from being the truth, Moore as usual is very, very funny. There are some actual laugh-out-loud parts of the book.Best reason to buy the book: Moore is going to use all the money he gets from the Bush tax cut to work against Bush and the Republican party in 2004. So help make Mike rich!"
2,Good but Could Have Been Better,"Michael Moore makes some good points in his book and really hits hard with his humor, but his fact-checking is not as good as it could have been. As reported on spinsanity.org, an equal opportunity website that attacks both Democrats and Republicans, and on other sites, the wide arrays of mistakes and clever omissions are detailed. Moore is even shameless enough to paint himself as a victim of his publisher's attempt to put his book on the backburner, even though he had thanked HarperCollins and Warner Books profusely for their work with his previous ""Stupid White Men."" Overall, Moore owes it to his readers to do a better job."
3,Conservatives...,"Anytime someone uses the words ""liberal agenda"", it's immediately time to ignore them. Ditto for ""media bias"" -- whether they be conservative or liberal.Read the book and form your own opinion. Don't let some idiot with his hands over his ears, screaming ""lalalalalalalala"" tell you about it... he's just proving that he didn't read it in the first place."
5,Bill O'Reilly's new book asks: Who's looking out for you?,"Answer: MICHAEL MOORE!!!!! And not the multi-millionaire O'Reilly. Moore is the spokesman and champian of the little guy --he's on your side!!After reading this book and watching his documentary ""The Big One,"" I feel that Michael Moore is right on and thru the target."
1,facts matter,"If you're not familiar with it, Spinsanity is a website run by a trio of self-described liberals. They specialize in fact-checking, and they don't spare either side in politics. You can see this quickly, if you browse their menu of columns.The site is at http://www.spinsanity.org.Their critique of Michael Moore's work is at http://www.spinsanity.org/columns/20031016.html. The title is a fair summary: ""Dude, Where's My Intellectual Honesty?""They also have a rigorous critique of Ann Coulter's _Slander_ available on the site.No disclaimer necessary in this review. Other than appreciating the quality of their work, I have no connection to the site. If it matters, I'm a university professor with a research interest in news media--and I'm firmly convinced that social critique is useless unless it's rooted in factual accuracy. In short, Moore's work is garbage--books and movies both."
5,Some people are in denial,"This documentary really exposes how people are manipulated to think. I was quite surprise at Charlton Heston's remark as to the cause of our gun violence. This is the man who played mosses? The message raises the question as to why people fear others and use guns the way we do. Unless you're in denial, you'll have no problem understanding why people fear others and use guns the way we do after seeing this documentary.I know some people have trouble with the animation segment of thisdocumentary, thus, they don't like Michael Moore.For those of you who don't like Michael Moore, I suggest you see Outfoxed."
5,"funny, pure entertainment.","Ok... we all know hollywood is good for two things. pretending to be someone else, and pretending to know politics. Moore is a pro. Unlike some other reader's reviews though, i knew i would not agree with him. It wasnt my point to read something i agree with. I got it to see how a ""actor"" could do writing a full book, 90% make believe...It's a riot, but not the type Moore wanted. If you are one who can laugh off political propaganda, read the KCNA news and definatly buy this book. You'll be rolling around on the ground laughing to no end. In Saving private ryan there was a scene where a german soldier was screaming on a loudspeaker ""the statue of liberty is kaput!"", well that's what this book is all about."
3,He could have done better,"Stupid White Men was an excellent book. I can't say the same about this one. I am one who wants Dubya out of the White House, but Michael Moore will not acheive it with this book. He has fun facts about Dubya but like Dubya, Moore uses these facts over and over again throughout his book. He oversaturated the book with the same facts just to have 250-so pages. Some chapters seemed too long just because he repeats himself a little too much. I know he wanted to make a point but he is using the same strategy that Mr Bush is using."
2,Started reading,"I started reading this book, and i was horribly disappointed. I loved Downsize This, Stupid White Men, and Bowling for Columbine, but Michael Moore just seems to have become too laid back. He makes a lot of claims against conservatives and backs them up, then makes a statement that would make sense, if he had any evidence for it. He makes a lot of stereotypes, and plays off of the fact that most of the people that actually read his book dislike Bush."
2,Moore is out to lunch this time,I like this guy and agree with many of his ideas but he is out to lunch this time. this bok would have made a very interesting paper but the repetition needed to make this a book destroys the product.
2,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I absolutely loved ""Roger and Me,"" the chronology of the life of GM CEO Roger Smith and the decline of cities like Flynt, MI due to massive layoffs by GM. 5 stars there.However, Moore has lost his direction and is only after character destruction in this publication. Far less worthy of ""Roger and Me,"" this is a pathetic attempt to continue his anti-establishment crusade at the expense of intelligent readers. Very sad, Michael, very sad indeed."
2,Looks like Michael Moore drank the kool-aid,"I thought I would get a fresh prospective when I read this book -- instead I found it to be nothing more than a bush-bashing book with no real facts or figures to back anything up -- you could sense the anger in this book. People often make rash, stupid and idiotic remarks when angry, these are often regreatable statements that hover over a person for a lifetime. I guess Michael Moore is no exception."
4,EXCELLANT,"I never agree with all of anybody's conclusions, but Moore does a great job of investigating and exposing hidden facts. I highly recommend this book, particulary to ""thinking"" people. It will anger those who believe everything that they hear on conservative broadcasts. Progressives, Greens and anyone with a truly open mind will love it!There are many obvious issues that he raises here that just don't occur to people. Read or listen to this book and draw your then own conclusions."
2,Moore stays true to himself!,"If you are a fan of Michael Moore and his far-left-wing opinions, this book will thrill you. As much as I disagree with this guy (and all liberals who can think of nothing but to blame every problem on the vast right-wing conspiracy, tax cuts, and guns) and don't respect this guy (for his Oscar stunt), this is very good political literature, much better than Franken's whining.I recommend this book to be read along with something by Rush Limbaugh or Ann Coulter. Then, you can get a good sense of the two major schools of thought on American politics.And may be that's just me, but I think Coulter will leave you much more convinced, impressed, and satisfied."
1,The King has risen,"Moore is the king of the liberal idiots, Frankin being a close second. Any well read, intellegent individual could destroy any argument he tries to make. It's hard to decide who to feel more sorry for, the author or the people who actually buy this junk."
4,The fools who haven't bothered.....,"Michael Moore has again written a book that gives voice to the frustrations and irritations that enlightened, intellectual Americans are feeling about the deceitful government and its irresponsibility. I loved this book, and it gets 4 out of 5 stars only because I wish it was as long as his previous efforts. The ""critics"" below me, who have nothing more to offer than Moore is ""fat"" and that he ought to leave the country, are quite typical of the fools who swallow everything fed to them without actually bothering to educate themselves. By the way, here's a little advice to the idiotic reviewers beneath me who decided to bash Moore's work without understanding it, or bothering to give it a genuine read: Please learn to spell correctly. If you want to appear like you know what you're talking about, even a little bit, learn to spell and speak correctly so that people like me don't keep laughing at jack-asses like you."
3,A confused reader,Why do right wing people who dislike this book have to SHOUT all the time. If they like SHOUTING so much what them makes them think they're justified in telling Michael Moore to SHUT UP?
1,Activism for idiots,"Michael Moore is the left-wing equivalent of emo. This is political activism that appeals to punk-rock kids who wear shirts saying ""Bush is an Idiot"".I'll admit I enjoyed ""Bowling For Columbine"" and ""Roger and Me"", but Moore is only revolting against the tip of a very stagnant ice-burg. Not only that, he is diverting attention from the real issue.The real issue is this: Bush is in partnership with the illuminati and the globalist. 9-11, the war, Oklahoma are all plots that have been in work for years to bring forth the new world order.Gun control is a very detrimental thing. The people must be armed in the event that the government becomes overly tyranical; we must learn to stop cowering in fear, and Michael Moore must be a pretty good fighter if he is willing to revolt without munitions.ALEX JONES IS THE ONE TO TURN TO: visit infowars.com"
1,Al Franken in disguise,"This man is almost as stupid as Bill Clinton and Al Franken combined. Now nobody could really come close to the stupidity of Daddy Bill alone. Add in Franken and that doubles the effect. But, back to Moore he attacks the right-wing with nothing but name-calling and made-up facts filled with tons of liberal propoganda. His intelligence level reminds me of $1 billion that William J. sent to Haiti. Well, it's not there. Where it is...Nobody knows... So if the thought of purchasing this book even crosses your mind, you are probably a tree-hugger or a standing member of NAMBLA, the EPA, PETA, or something of the ridiculous sort. Michael Moore and Hillary may have something in common, this being the most anti-american authors we've seen in years. Sorry I'm out of time, I've got to go WORK so I can pay for the people depending on me for their welfare checks."
1,The country he hates should be the one he leaves,In answer to Moore's question I would tell him that I don't know where his country is and that perhaps it is time to claim to be from anywhere but America. This book is pure hate and lies about a country that has given Moore the freedom not only to attack it but to become rich doing it. If you wish to waste your time fine but don't waste money buying this trash. I have my copy for sale but so does every one else from the looks of it.
1,Believing his own hype.,"Is everything really W's fault? I think not. To listen to Moore and his media preeners, I would think that all was honest, wholesome, and apple-pie during the Clinton years.All in all, Moore is far too impressed by his own hype."
1,Total Garbage,"What a vile, disgusting, ridiculous book! Not only is it horribly written, it is childish, trite and completely based on ""zero"" facts, much like the false documentary he made on Columbine. When they take his academy award off of him, they also need to take any writing implements along with it. He projects negativity, hopelessness and stupidity. Why any one would read such absurdity is beyond me. He is so obsessed with being ""a liberal"" that he will go to any lengths to discredit the Bush Administration, even lieing. He loses his objectivity and his common sense often twisting and turning events and facts at will. This book is a total joke and the only way it has made it on the best sellers list is because the likes of Barbara Streisand bought thousands of copies to boost sales. I'll guarantee you, he doesn't speak for us ""non-Hollywood"" folks.My recommendation for this book...don't buy it My recommendation if you did buy it....mail it back."
1,Ruin good stories with facts - not this man,"Where were you Michael, when Billy was caught with his pants down and lobbed a few missiles at Bin Laden. Moore's ramblings are, as usual for this sort of twaddle, anecdotal, one-eyed and generally incoherent.By the way, who would win the World Series if team A won the first three games 2 to 0 and team B won the next four 1 to 0. Could Team A claim that Team B stole the World Series?Forget it."
1,Great BS,"YOU can ASSURE us, Portland? A close relative died on 9/11. Your hero, the well-known fantastic genius, says she was likely killed by the Saudi Air Force, and anyway there's no problem. Maybe you can have a good laugh about that too.This is a deeply distasteful book, and anyone with an ounce of liberal feeling - or just plain feeling - should be able to see that."
1,"dude,where's my cheeseburger?","this book is a plainy distasteful, boring and a one sided and biased misinterpratation of facts by this big fat bully who plainly is biased against the present president.dont waste your valuable time in reading this sloppy and inept book.please avoid his stupid documentary as well.i am waiting to watch the movie michael moore hates america eagerly."
1,A Silly Man's Point of View,"Don't buy this trash... You'll get much more enjoyment out of smacking your head endlessly against a birck wall...Michael Moore babbles about Bush being Satan and this and that and blah blah blah...Great job, Mike! You're a very bright human being... Now please leave this great nation, and take the rest of the left-wing extremists with you!"
2,Huh?,"I am sorry, but this book is another attempt to make money off of the liberal population of this country. Basically, I bought it becuase of the title. Not all is right in government but to act like Clinton or other Democrats are not involved in the same stuff. Dude Where is Your Brain or rather Your Thought Processes?"
1,Tosh,I had bought this hoping the plot would be a sort of cross between the funny and moving Tom Hanks flick The Terminal and the wonderful laughfest that was Dude Wheres My Car. Instead its just a story about a man who keeps bleating on about politics. Rubbish.
1,0 Yes ZERO Stars,"Michael Moore writes and produces to promote the views of Michael Moore, nothing else. That he can do so is tribute to the political climate and arena that he so often criticizes. His efforts do nothing more than line his wallet for the sake of opportunity. His efforts on the ""literary"" venue are biased, and a personal agenda. That this puffy, fat man of simple mind can try to influence the masses in such a Large fashion is totally...American."
1,"Dude, Where's My Country?","Michael Moore is only writing this book to make money. I think he was actually shocked that his previous book did so well. Everything he writes about is fabricated and untrue. The only thing that matters to the man is his own agenda of communism. Has this so called man ever defended his country? No. A crispy cream donut - that I can accept. As long as people are willing to pay for this ---t, he will keep on typing."
1,"Dude, Where's my refund?","This is recycled and tired diatribe from a man who seems to have a disturbingly high opinion of himself. Moore is one of the world's most overrated contemporary writers/info-tainers. There is no bibliography to confirm the sources that the author uses to support his claims. As is the case with most radicals, this book's success hinges on the author's dependence on his audience's unconditional support and acceptance of what turns out to be nothing more than conjective guesswork. In the past, Moore has played fast and loose with the facts and he has gotten burned for it. You would think that he would get it right this time around. But alas!Needless to say, despite all of Moore's ranting, he presents absolutely no credible alternatives to the divisive issues that he presents in the book. Very disappointing."
1,Garbage in Garbage out,"I checked this book out of the campus library because so many of my friends were talking about it. I have always had on open mind, but this book is full of inaccuracies and blatant lies. I outlined several of the lies in a word document and sent them, with sources, to my friends who were so excited about this book. Many of them had NO IDEA that Moore had such inaccuracies. Honestly, I can't believe his publisher allowed such lies to be printed. It seems that they would be open to lawsuits from some of the people involved. Isn't that the editor's job?"
1,"Blah, Blah, Blah...","More inane opinions without complete accurate facts from another author with such a special ego that he thinks he knows what is best for all. Moore is one of a dozen of self proclaimed experts on what citizens of the USA should know and do. He along with these other self proclaimed experts, both conservative and liberal, all have one thing in common. They all are profiteering from the current political environment.Save your money and conduct some personal research with a critical analysis of any and all alleged facts. Freedom of choice and the right to know the facts are important elements of this country's foundation. Do not buy someone's opinion, think for yourself."
1,What a Piece of Garbage!,"The good thing about America, is we ARE a FREE-COUNTRY, and allow trash like this to be published :)This left-wing lunatic has clearly lost his mind... Anyone who can't see the importance of the War on Terror should really have their head examined...It's one thing to be a Liberal, but it's another to be a LOONEY-LIBERAL, like Michael Moore. They must have some really hysterical get togethers when he meets up with Babs Striesand, Mike Farrel, Bill Maher and all of the other Left-Wing Loonies!Please, spare yourself from this rediculous book. You'll learn more reading about Big Bird and Bob the Builder... :)"
4,The Truth That Fits Your Reality,"It IS interesting that most people wind up either bashing this book or loving it, but your enjoyment of this book depend on your political views. Michael Moore is a witty and interesting author, and ""Dude, Where's My Country?"" is a great read for any liberal. However, any conservative or moderate expecting to find anything they can agree with in a book by Michael Moore has only themselves to blame. If you become offended easily or find it hard to take things lightly, this is not the book for you. Otherwise, if you enjoy left-wing viewpoints and are looking for a funny and interesting book, I highly recommend it."
5,Right-wing nuts can dish it but they can't take it!,"BUSH IS MY SHEPHERDBush is my shepherd, I shall be in want.He leadeth me beside the still factories,He maketh me to lie down on park benches,He restoreth my doubts about the Republican party.He guideth me onto the paths of unemployment for the party's sake.I do fear the evildoers, for thou talk'st about them constantly.Thy tax cuts for the rich and thy deficit spending,They do discomfort me.Thou anointeth me with never-ending debt,And my savings and assets shall soon be gone.Surely poverty and hard living shall follow me,And my jobless children shall dwell in my basement forever."
3,"Good Start, Bad Finish.","After being impressed at the beginning of the book at how the Bush Government works, particular its actions after the events of 9/11, Michael Moore book slides into him rambling on about his dislikes for 'The Rich' and the corp. they run. In the end i get the impression that Michael Moore attacks on what he deems evil about the USA mirrors Bush's attacks on what he sees evil about the world."
3,The Few 1 Start Reviews Seem to Support Moore's Claim.,"Interesting, every 1 start review in here is a personal attack on Mr. Moore, not a single one offers an alternative view or link to a web site that attempts to refute Moore's claims.Its almost comical and tragic at the same time how these people who believe they are ""Republican"" (whatever that means) just support his claims on how many people in American are being dupped by political leadership on both sides.Its comical to here people call themselves Rebuplican thinking that this automatically implies membership in some club making them feel better or somehow intelligent being anti-liberal, pro-American, pro-guns, pro-fiscal conservitive, blah blah blah.Same comedy happening with those who blindly call themselves a Democrat."
1,Just Want to Add one Thing. . .,"Well. . .it seems like everyone has a definite opinion on this book (and has written a review on it). So I'm not going to bother to write a complete review. I'll just quote my favorite part of the book:""They call it a war on 'Terror.' How exactly do you conduct a war on a noun?""I'm not even going to comment on this, because the people who see the absurdity of that statement don't need it clarified, and the people who take it seriously don't read enough."
1,More Lies By Michael Moore,"Picked this one up in the Bookstore. It's just another angry screed from the man who brought you the ""Documentary"" that was largely staged and made up, ""Bowling for Columbine."" I saw lots of lies and accusations and no evidence. And the country Michael Moore says he's looking for has nothing in common with the nation that Jefferson, Madison et al founded in the inerest of personal freedom and liberty...the nation Moore says he is looking for sounds more like one of Europe's failing socialist nanny states. No thanks dude!"
3,Interesting but nothing new,"Michael Moore has a tallent for speaking his mind but this book did not fully demonstrate his ability. I read this book after having read other books thats purposes were similair such as theives in high places. Some of the chapters from both of the books were on the same topics as one another but that is ok because they both could have differing opinions and statictics. However, i was amazed at how close this book came to other books which came out prior to its release. Some of the same facts and anecdotes could easily be found in other books. If you are a progressive thinker and want a good original book that not only criticizes but proposess new ideas is Had Enough? by James Carville. This book is definitely worth your time reading."
5,A Graet BooK !,Exalted second edition 1th edition wos good 2edition is epicit a great game so buy it at amazon for $26 not $40!?!
3,"A must-have if you're in an Exalted campaign, but . . .","I have to say, I really don't like the way White Wolf structures their content. I would prefer to have more sidebars, tables and the like, as a lot of often-referenced rules and such are buried in the text, and the index is less than helpful. Also, the way they word a lot of the rules is somewhat imprecise, and leaves things open to interpretation. They need a good content editor and someone to make the material more accessible to first-time White Wolf gamers. All in all, it's a solid product, the illustrations are nice and the layout looks very professional. Handle with care though, the binding doesn't seem to be all that strong."
5,White Wolf does it again!,"Another great book from ""White Wolf""First of all, this is a huge book with nearly 400 pages (it has 395) with (beautifully written!) information on this very cool world and system.It is also visually stunning - with full color, high quality pages, lots of original artwork, and a short comic at the opening of each chapter.Highly recommended."
5,Great mini-vacation to New Jersey!,"I haven't enjoyed a book so much for a long time. The characters are all hilarious. I found myself alternately rooting for almost everyone, even the shallow shop-a-holic heroine, in spite of the fact that I am more the ardent environmentalist type than suburban yuppie mom. Thanks for a lot of fun, Debra!Pam Beason, Author of Wild"
4,Fun? Yes. Landmark? No.,"This book is smart and entertaining to read. However, it's theme is too trendy for it to be a breakout type of novel. I recommend it for light reading."
1,How did this find a publisher?,"Might have made a column or two (the author was a newspaper columnist), but stretched out to novel length becomes thin gruel. Nobody can be as one-dimensionally bad as the heroine, and her redemption at the end is too quick, too abrupt, and too minor to be convincing. By that time we loathe her so thoroughly that nothing can salvage our interest in her. Awkward prose, tin ear for dialogue. Avoid."
4,Fun but Dumb,"A good summer read, but ridiculous. This is good chewing gum for the brain. Perhaps an easy read on the beach, or on a plane. Perhaps you want to read the comics, but already have.Rattled won't go into the history books as good literature."
4,Rattled - a short trip,"This was our book club selection for July which was perfect because this is the kind of book you can read on the beach or from the deck of your cabin in the woods. It reads like a short story, its funny and the characterizations are lively. Don't expect any deep revelations about human nature here. Just a book that is fun to share."
1,How low can you go?,"Never mind the stereotypical characters, the hack's nightmare of a plot, or the surprise twist of an ending that is no surprise at all. Exactly how many times can an audience watch the same group of people escape certain death by a centimeter, in a cumbersome vehicle that is famous for slow acceleration and lousy steering, before we:1)stop worrying about the characters' fate.2)start wishing they will die, just for a change of pace.3)actually yawn at the death of all mankind.Roland Emmerich must have really wanted to know, because he spent 300 million dollars and 3 hours to find the answer."
3,"Marathon movie, by no means a classic, though","I was about ready to wrap this one up at the 2-hour mark, but NO....like that annoying Energizer Bunny, it kept going and going. The pace was poorly directed and the ending was so very predictable. I'll give it some credit as the apocalyptic scene was cool to watch, but an hour long? Really?"
2,2012 - A Disaster Movie that was a Disaster,"The special effects were very good. If you like seeing the world get distroyed - this is the movie for you. The story line was just - OK. OK - the world is coming to an end - got it! Now what. Out run - out last - and watch everyone else get killed. OK - what next? Kind of a let down. It sees that money or power (or speed) were the only reasons that people deserved to be ""saved"". If I become rich enough or famous enough (or fast enough) - can I be ""saved"" too? The few swear words that were in the movie - could have been left out and it would have been a much better movie. Save your money - wait for it to hit the bargin-bin."
3,2012 Review,"It was a good movie if you simply suspend your belief in reality. As in all movies coming out of hollywood now-a-days, one must accept this movie with a grain of salt. Lots of action and the characters were very involved. There was not a lot of depth development for some and some ""moments"" when you wished there was no development. All in all, worth watching, but, I wouldn't write home about it."
2,"Meh. Cool visuals, decent story at times, but too fantisiful and cliche.","For as long as this movie is it packs a Ton of action, little story and plenty of cliche into it.I stopped counting the 'near miss' deaths of the main characters after like 100.While they use Hollywood cliche life-saving luck for most of the movie amidst the never endingexplosions, there is little script. The script they do have is only ok. No real story...there are some moments that tug at the heart strings, but not hard to do when you tell any storyand put in death or potential death of family (the family you've been acquainted with).Other than the never-ending cliche and poor script, the main character family seems to care littleabout the BILLIONS of people dying around them. Its not even mentioned, and is almost laughable.I'd say its worth the 3.00 rental.. not worth buying or paying 7.00 in the theatres."
3,So much potential so little delivered,"I was really looking forward to this movie, that said aside from the spectacular effects the movie sucked, too lame of a plot all the things that had to happen in order for the hero to survive was too much to take, absolutely unable to suspend disbelief."
1,Nice CGI imagery - otherwise waste of time,"If you want to marvel at some wonderfully done CGI work, this is a treat, to watch briefly. The story itself is gravely overexaggerated, with poor acting. Countless ""close calls at the last possible second"" and just completely unbelievable in all regards. Strange thing is, they ace the CGI, yet one scene where the characters (if you call them that) are in the back of a truck, it looks like a small town studio shot it. No sun, shadows, or wind, just a clean ride with a stormy green-screened backdrop. Maybe worth a dollar to rent, but not worth the 2 hours to expect any sort of enjoyable story. I'm not sure why Danny Glover subjected himself to such a poor film. This is the last John Cusack movie I will bother watching."
1,Pathetic,"Take some of the most extreme liberal hack actors -- Danny Glover, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson -- the director of the liberal ""disaster"" film ""The Day After Tomorrow"" (both in genre and boxoffice, as well as in critical acclaim), add liberal cliches and platitudes for a script, stir in CG effects that are nonsensical (a car driving unimpededly right through the concrete columns of a crumbling building, and a plane flying unimpededly through tons of falling rubble from 2 collapsing skyscrapers) and you have this trite disaster of a film. The cast and crew made its propaganda intent predictable,I only watched it for free on satellite to see Amanda Peet, who came out unscathed in all senses, but I hope she avoids the next liberal disaster/propaganda film: which will probably try to scare people to believe that the world will end if OBama is not reelected, when the real disaster is what he has done to our country already."
1,2012,"One of the worst disaster movies I have seen- I am so tired of the slo-mo that moves that are edited in just to make sure we ""get it"" ranks right down there with Planet Earth with John Travolta"
2,2012 - What was I thinking!,If you are considering this DVD...let me help you...don't waste your money! Stupid plot; Stupid actors; Stupid stretches from reality. It gets two stars for the special effects.
1,crazy. a nine year olds review,"I never watched this movie but my friends have they said they saw this movie and the movie said "" the world going to end in 2012"" they said the worlds going to end tommorow but I do not buying it. The world wont end until aproxamitely 25.0 billion years."
1,Is there a way to give zero stars?,"This movie is ridiculous. Yeah, the special effects are nice and all, but the wrong aspect ratio causes the dreaded top and bottom black bars on HD-TVs, so what's the point. The story line is non-existent and as others have mentioned here, if all we get save to repopulate the planet are stupid politicians and greedy mega corporate moguls, I rather fall in the yellowstone cracks when it explodes and die. What a load of you know what this movie became. I feel sorry for the actors that probably felt like they were participating in some kind of super block buster movie. They were scammed."
1,Nothing new here,Just your basic disaster movie. Nothing new here. I got bored with it quickly. Only bright spot in this movie was Woody Harrelson's character.
2,Only made for the effects,"This movie was apparently only made for the special effects. I love John Cusak, and Amanda Peet. However, this was not a good movie. The effects were great, but so unbelievable that most of it was ridiculous. I don't recommend it. I would watch ""Day After Tomorrow"" instead. It's much better and a little more realiztic."
5,2012 DVD,The special effects were amazing. The DVD arrived in excellent condition as promised and we really enjoyed this movie.
2,Film,"Poor film, special effects looks bad and probability of some of the catastrophes occurring the way they portray are not within the realm of physical science. We ending up making fun of the whole film while watching it."
3,Great Action Movie,"I heard a lot of negative reviews about this movie and as someone that is interested in this topic it was good. It wasn't great, it was an average action movie that would get your thinking about the end of the world. John Cusack played a great part as parts go for him and my nine year old son absolutely loved this movie for all the action in it. It is full on action and maybe a tiny bit too much action, maybe they could have concentrated on the story more but it was very watchable, entertaining and it is by no means disappointing."
4,Can you hear me now?,"Sure, ""All ground communications have ceased"" but I can still a call from my buddy in India while he bodysurfs a tsunami with his wife and kid. Just another of the many tender moments Roland Emmerich has brought us over the years. 2012 is Emmerich's best effort since Independence Day and may in fact be even more ridiculous and that's a substantial achievement. Thank God the world didn't fall in one of the holes in the plot, they're bottomless and where would we be then? We'd still be waiting for those two little, fat bastards to get it. All I can say is ""You go Gordon, you're dogmeat of the year!""If you took it seriously and liked it..okay. If you've been looking for a good unintentional laugh ever since Independence Day, here it is. Mostly recommended."
1,What ever happened to Hollywood???,Why make a real effort at writing a remotely believable story when you can just blow the screen up with a bunch of CGI?Good for the kiddies maybe.Insulting to the intelligence otherwise.Woody and John must have been looking for a little weekend spending money or something.Horrible.
1,Disappointing,"This film was a major disappointment. The director took a very, very important subject matter and reduced it to nothing more than animation and more animation with very little substance to the story and how the world is impacted by global warming/climate change. I was really looking forward to watching it given the group of actors involved. It even falls short of being entertaining. I walked away with a massive headache."
1,Worst movie ever!,"It's amazing how our society loves destruction-porn crapola like this. Blow up the world, kill everyone, watch your cities destroyed in front of your eyes!!! The only survivors are politicians and rich capitalists escaping to giant boats?? Fun Fun Fun!!!??? Really?If you are a typical, modern movie going moron who loves mindless destruction and don't care about plot, acting, or reality you will love this. I just hope that you choke to death on your popcorn while watching. Hey maybe that'd make a good movie. I'm sure we can find plenty of morons to fund it and even more morons to pay their money to see it."
4,On-the-edge movie,movie played great on my computer. the movie itself a little far-fetched but kept me on the edge of my seat.
3,Time for Miracles,"The best thing about this movie is the song Time for Miracles brilliantly sung Adam Lambert during the ending credits...a gorgeous song worth checking out, it was originally written by the songwriter Natasha Shneider and her husband Alain Johannes near the end of her life. It's a sentiment that will outlast the Mayan theme, obvi, and Adam Lambert's phenomenal range and power does it justice."
3,Completely unbelievable and lots of fun,"Don't watch this thinking it's anything other than a disaster film. There's very little serious plot, the acting is just above average, and the science is beyond laughable... but who cares?!?!The action and effects are fun, the movie is pretty, and there is just enough of that minimal plot and acting to tie all the crazy together.Younger kids might be traumatized, but everyone else will likely be entertained."
4,2012,I like natural disaster movies because they are remote to my life. I wouldn't recommend it to any overly serious thinkers.
3,2012 was just OK,"I have seen so many disaster movies that even if the special effects are magnificent or outstanding, there is still nothing new under the sun. If you absolutely this kind of movie...go for it."
1,"Popcorn movies with little substance, predictable and full of cliches","This movie is filled with the most obvious cliches and stereotypes anyone can come up. Except for the disaster and destruction scenes (which are neat I must admit), I was cringing after nearly every frame. I dont know how anyone of these producers in Hollywood thought that in their professional, somewhat artist driven opinion, this script with its cheesy, trite dialogs and shallow, two dimensional characters was worth financing. It is one of those movies you know Hollywood studios took on for the profits at the box office only and not because of the quality of the story line and acting ability of the performers. Most of the movie is CGI and the rest is pretty much a long sequence of one trite line uttered after another. It's a great popcorn movie if you just want to spend an evening with mindless entertainment, but if you expect something plausible and with quality, skip this one."
2,"...uhm, ok","This movie is an example of how skilled special effects artist can really expose a poorly executed film. The special effects had it ratcheted up to 11 while the acting and directing really lagged behind. It was like watching two movies. You were blown away by the special effects and when it came time for the dialog you just want to fast-forward it.-The whole ""Hurry it's right behind us!"" thing was WAY over done and things got hokey real quick.-It's a sound premise, a descent story...But it went WAY overboard and into the realm of silliness.-Hats off to the special effects artists, yeah some of the more elaborate ""run away"" scenes were over the top and stupid...But they were just doing what they were told and did a great job of it."
4,Big budget laugh riot,"2012 is an amazing movie. The catastrophic special effects are absolutely amazing, and the story is hilarious. I was either laughing or exclaiming with surprise at the disasters the whole way through this movie. This was the funniest, most unusual comedy I have seen in the last couple of years."
2,A complete disaster...with a vengeance,"I haven't watched this movie. Nor will I watch it. I just looked at the trailer.It all looks rather familiar...I suspect ""2012"" is just another disaster movie, but with more spectacular special effects.Yawn.Perhaps a rebout featuring Bruce Willis could do the trick? They could call it ""Die REALLY Hard 2012"".Incidentally, all the claims about the end of the world happening in 2012 are bogus. Nothing will happen in 2012, I assure you. Except that Barack Obama will be re-elected! That may be the bitter end of the Neo-Cons and the Leo-Cons, but hardly the planet as such.And if we are really lucky, maybe Ronald Emmerich will make a new disaster movie? I'm sure the apocalyptic cults will set a new date when Disaster 2012 fails to materialize. Some illusions, after all, die hard.[This review was actually posted in 2009 on another product page. Told you so! Nothing happened. Except, of course, that Obama was indeed re-elected...]"
1,Dumbest movie ever!!!,Unbelievably stupid movie. Almost nothing but vehicles running from the ground opening up and buildings crashing down around them. Don't waste your money this. It's not even worth renting.
1,If people really acted like this global distruction would be a blessing,"""Oh my goodness were headed to Africa...hmmmm I always wanted to go to Africa. I heard it's romantic...a perfect place to have a second honeymoon with my ex-wife who was so heartless she forgot that a man who she said loved died."" Well my family is safe so who cares about the billions of people and countless species of plants and animals who were wiped off the face of the earth, oh well I have my hot wife back...too bad that the human race is basically back in the stone age.""I wonder if I could go on a safari"" I saw those giraffes that were put in a giant sling and exposed to the elements for 1000 miles."" Maybe I could hunt one of those.""""hmmm I wonder if this cruse ship has room service?""These must be the thoughts of one of the dumbest main characters I have ever seen in film. This film has greed written all over it so bad that it smells like a pork chop.!!!"
1,Horrid movie,"This is like a family movie - only with 'f'bombs galore, people being cut in two, and terrible terrible acting. Well the acting thing may be a stretch...it stinks in family movies too. Seriously though to watch a limo jump a falling building was so over-the-top and ridiculous I had a hard time making it till the end."
1,Worst movie of 2009,"I don't see how anyone can give this movie more than 1 star, it was complete trash. The special effects were pretty good but the movie was so bad that you don't see any of it because your sitting there with your face in your palm the whole time. The only good thing in the entire movie is Woody Harrelsons character who is actually pretty funny despite everything else.Save your money and if you absolutely must see this out of curiosity just rent it."
3,Ok...,"I have to say that this movie was alright not really spectacular but the effects were awesome and its kinda predictable about one guy finding out about the end of the world and the dates, then they take it to the government and they don't pay attention until it finally happens and the person who discovered the whole thing survives...Kinda like The Day After Tomorrow..But there was one thing that bothered me...they showed the problems of the other countries who were going through the Tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, volcanoes, snow, etc like in China but they never showed anyone from Africa...and then at the end they all go Africa like where the whole world started...i didn't like that, its kinda like they just threw that in there at the last minute. But anyway... it was average"
1,Where do I go to get my 2 1/2 hours back?,"Bad acting (or maybe it was the writing?). No, it was the acting AND the writing. Repetitive and predictable action sequences. The characters were a hodgepodge of every cliche you can imagine - separated couple with exactly 2.0 kids (one boy, one girl); the mom's boyfriend who is more or less doomed from the start (did I mention the movie was predictable?); a black president who is a widower and his hot Dr. Daughter, who hooks up with the scientist; an evil Russian tycoon and his twin brat children; the hippie conspiracy theorist; the Tibetan monk . . . . blah blah blah. I mean they didn't miss one stereotype. The characters were so thin, when they turned sideways they disappeared."
1,Sci-Fi Comedy?,"2012 is so full of inaccuracies that it is almost a comedy. My wife and I and our friends laughed ourselves silly at some of the absolutely idiotic ""facts"" in this terrible movie. How about ""Mount Big Horn"", the HIGHEST peak in Yellowstone Park at 2100 feet?!?! The LOWEST elevation in Yellowstone is 5000+ feet and the highest is Eagle Peak at 11,000+ feet. And how about the ""boiling"" mud pot made by throwing dry ice into a mud puddle? The rest of this movie is so absurd as to defy description. 2012 is a lesson in how NOT to make a disaster flick or a sci-fi movie! If you MUST watch this fiasco, be prepared for some good chuckles."
4,2012,"I found the movie, 2012, a little far out, but the special effects were enough to hold my attention thru out the movie. I liked it!"
2,2012,I bought this movie thinking with all the hype that it would be wonderful. Not so. A waste of money. I have seen many disaster movies in the past that were much better. eathquake was one of them.
2,Bad...,"..mind-blowingly, cringingly, staggeringly bad. In fact, so bad that it's almost classically bad and therefore worth watching. Every maudlin cliché beloved of American cinema (estranged husband-wife, boy meets girl, in the midst of total catastrophe) is marshalled and sent into battle. George Gershwin's immortal lines""In time, the Rockies may crumbleGibraltar may tumbleThey're only made of clayBut our love is here to stay.""essentially sum up the film, except you get to see something similar to the first two lines happen in real time.Between the clichés and the scientific/technological impossibilities (neutrinos changing into different types of neutrinos???) are the special effects, and these are (just) sufficient justification for watching this appalling turkey, for they are indeed spectacular.What's especially amusing is that the Chinese get the big manufacturing job - is there a moral there somewhere?"
3,Nothing to write home about,"Great effects but the story is a little lame. Acting is OK, but no Academy Awards on this one. OK"
3,So so movie,"It's an ok movie, completely computer generated graphics but it has its moments. Overall I give it 3 out of 5"
1,ummmmmmm.,"Terrible. Laughable. Uncreative. Just like ""Day After Tommorrow"" where people are literally running away from the weather that is chasing them, these people are runnning away from water, earthquakes and rolling buildings. Laughable... just laughable. I can't believe people actually take this film serious."
1,Borrow only!,"I bought this, can you believe it? Find someone like me who bought it and borrow it from them. My copy is now floating out in the world somewhere and I hope it never returns."
1,Great Trailer. Wack movie.,"I enjoyed the trailer 10 times more than the film. Awful acting, plot, dialogue. Sad because my favorite actors are in this cesspool of a movie. Boo! Hisss!! Why Thandie? Why???"
1,"Should've been called ""Narrow Escape""","This ""disaster"" movie was a complete disaster. Where to begin?(Spoilers) The beginning is confusing. But it isn't until the actual destruction began... Then I really started to hate this movie. John Cusack and his family narrowly escape the destruction about 6 times or more in this horrendous pile of garbage. Every single time, it is right on their heels. And the parts where he jumps the limo, and then later jumps the RV. It was embarassing. And then the parts that attempt humor- I just wanted to throw a brick through my TV screen. What could they have possibly been thinking? Talk about a movie that had incredible potential. But instead we just got an almost 3-hour steaming pile of dog crap.I hate this movie."
3,I liked it just for the action.,A little far fetched and many things didn't add up but it was okay.It was suspenseful but they were gaps.
5,2012,Everyone should have this movie in their library! Never get tired of watching it. Gave as Christmas presents ! Great flick.
2,Laughably bad,"Despite the effort on the special effects, this movie was bad. It almost shouldn't even be watched by people who love bad movies. The predictability of this movie plus its totally cheesy dialogue makes it almost intolerable. I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know."
1,I need to contact the seller !!! I just can see the trailers !!,"I bought this a few months ago & just recently tried to watch it, but I got surprice that the movie never play it , just the previews, over and over...How can I contacT the seller?? I want to return it for a one that works properly, please help !!"
1,I want my 2.39 hours and $14.99 back!,"Not sure what else to say except this move isn't worth watching even if it was free much less $14.99 to purchase or $3.99 to rent.This is on my ""worst movies of all time"" list right up there with Nick Cage's ""The Wicker Man."" If there was a zero star rating, I'd give it to this movie."
2,American style crap!,"What a complete utter utter load of bollocks!The visual effects were good, in a computer graphic generated sort of fashion, but the over the top dramatics and the absolutely unbelievable plot line, not to mention the Americans being the ""centre of the universe"" as usual...... well what can I say.It was patronising and offensive to just about every other country including China, Russia, the UK, India..... pathetic!"
1,Standard Emmerich garbage,"Ok, this guy blows stuff up better than anyone I have ever seen. But god, this movie was awful."
1,"Tedious, boring and seriously stupid","One of the largest pieces of garbage I have had the missfortune of watching, kevin costner's water world made more sense. Tedious, outlandish and just plain stupid in every possible way."
1,This movie was a disaster.,"I wanted to see a serious disaster move and instead, a ridiculous slapstick comedy broke out. This is a movie about the end of the world, it should be thought provoking and frightening. At the end of the movie it should leave you disturbed and wondering. Actually I was disturbed and wondering but not in the ways that I should have been. I was disturbed that anyone would bother to make a movie this bad, one that had SO much potential, and wondering how anyone could possibly think that this is a good movie. I read the 4 and 5 star reviews and wondered if I watched the same move that these people did."
1,Not worth the extra money!,Amazon is selling an out dated version of the Blu-Ray/DVD combo (Digital Copy PC/MAC/PSP Version) of this movie so it is not worth the extra money. Get the regular Blu-Ray (Single Disk) version instead. The Digital Copy codes expired on 3/02/11 and is worthless. I just bought this and saw that it was a Digital Copy version so I was excited about adding the D.C. to my new Tablet (part of the reason I bought this version). So now I have the 3 disk set and can only use 1 of the 3 disks...
3,Typical Story Line,"Most everyone dies on the planet, but our hero who can drive thru a building can make it till the end.Once you get past all the dumb luck and fancy driving and flying, you can enjoy the movie.Not much point about mankind. Just family adventure."
1,Movies That Suck,"I only paid $1.00 to rent this piece of work, and that was a waste of my money. If you saw the trailers, you saw everything that was worth watching. The acting was wooden, the plot was ridiculous. The special effects, yes, were indeed spectacular. The entire movie could EASILY have been condensed down to an hour and a half, which would have been tolerable. My advice, rent before you buy."
1,It was terrible audio,I couldn`t hear it. Can`t you make the audio on your products louder???All of the trailers I watched had the same problem. Please turn up the volume
4,"Big, Entertaining, and Dumb","This ""end of the world"" movie is big, visually stunning, and very entertaining. However, you have to overlook the fact that hundreds of millions of people are being killed, often before our very eyes. The science behind it is sheer nonsense so there is little concern about this movie becoming a documentary."
1,This was so-so,"I liked the special effects. The story sucked and some of the acting was bad. Woody H? what a joke. Could have done without him, but I guess the character had to get the map from somewhere. The ending was the worst. Just liked the special effects."
2,Excellent Acting,"By Mr. Special Effects. Rest of the actors? Ya call them actors!! I don't! There is our hero, who looks like a zero, his obligatory son with an attitude problem, his divorced wife, then there is a young black man who is another old Black man's Jackass, who while predicting the end of this WORLD AS WE KNOW IT, couldn't control his penis ogling at the old Black Man's daughter, who is faux black. Do,we, Indians have an accent such as presented by these Hollywood movies? I don't think so. Do we decorate our taxis with flowers? I don't think so! The movie is stupid but entertaining enough, if not, at all, for the fake-actors, but at least for the special effects!"
1,A Real Stinker,"Simply Put, one of the worst movies ever made...worse than Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.My only problem is...how do I get my money back from Best Buy without lying...I guess I'm out of pocket $16.99 plus tax and reamed, steamed and dry cleaned by Roland Emmerich again; but never again, I'll see to that.The funny thing is...I'll probably watch it again just to see how bad it really was the first time I witnessed this calamity and to think that there are people dyin' in the streets and we spend money on such tripe and I hope the Cow's brain doesn't take it personally being compared to this POS and I could go on but won't waste anymore of your time or mine, so...Peace Out,Warren"
1,SILLY RACIST MOVIE!!,"A festival of the destruction of Western Civilization, and all that's left at the end is Africa? I'd rather drown!Thank goodness this terrible film is only fiction!"
1,Horrible Movie,This is a typical over advertised piece of trash movie. The effects were good but a computer did that ! They lied more about this movie then Obama did in the last 2 years. Save your money !!! you'll need it for taxes.
2,Disaster of a Movie!,"This movie had all the great special effects that you would expect from an end of the world movie but the characters were beyond boring. It's basically a guy running all over the place trying to save his family. However, they don't really deserve it. His kids seem more invested in there new stepdad and his ex-wife treats him like a complete idiot. Meanwhile, he is still trying to get everyone to saftey. Yes we have seen this story before but never has it been so boring. I would definately skip this one. Even the special effects are not enough to save this. I'll give it only one thumb down because of the eplosions. Holla!"
1,"The World is Ending, Better Duck...","If 2001 was the appetizer and 2010 was the meal, then 2012 is surely the dessert with the cream filling!"
1,One the worst films ever made,"The special effects are good (though the green-screening is not up to the effects). Some are outstanding. But this movie requires a lot more than suspension of disbelief. It requires a full lobotomy. Absurdly bad.Then again, who needs a plot when you have a budget of $200 million and a really terrible but really well-connected director? The saddest part is that Danny Glover, John Cusack, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Oliver Platt, and Woody Harrelson are phenomenal actors and the rest of the cast is fine; it's just the filmmaking that really sucks."
2,Swiss Cheese,"If the movie's plot was a block of cheese, it would be Swiss. Exciting escape sequences, otherwise a frustrating experience as a junior bureaucrat repeatedly endangers people with his idealism and outrage, and a chauffeur with pretensions of being a novelist performs remarkable stunts."
3,razzle-dazzle slapstick apocalypse,"This film is the oddest mix of comedy and melodrama, all against the backdrop of the end of the world with the most spectacular computer-generated effects. It's definately fun to watch - our whole family laughed and commented our way through it - but after a while it is too over the top to suspend your disbelief. In a way, it views like a James Cameron wannabee production, just without as much imagination. Sure, it's endearing, there are lots of genuinely wonderful performances (my favorite was Woody Harrelson as a nut case broadcaster who wanted to describe the end first), and it's a all's-well-that-ends-well conclusion (including a divorced couple re-finding eachother), but the sentimentalism is too much.REcommended as quite good throwaway entertainment."
4,A Special Effect Cupcake,"Great movie, and thought provoking on socio / economic relations. Overall I rate it four out of five stars. It bears a good watch every once in awhile. Or at least until 12/23/2012. :-)"
2,Disappointing,"This movie is a silly adventure flick. I had to laugh at how the family was escaping in California as it was going into the sea (I kept thinking ""only in the movies""). This was a very disappointing movie and far too long at 2 hours, 39 minutes. I really expected it to be more realistic and true to what is going to really happen. It is true that our politicians have made amenities for themselves in mountains, etc, but to think they'll let the common folk on an ""ark"" and then we can start over, well first of all, they will only attempt to save themselves and secondly, there will be no ark in any case. Well like I said, it's not realistic. If you like fun and sci-fi, I guess this movie is for you. If you are looking for something more like what's really ahead for the earth, you will be very disappointed. I was generous in giving it two stars."
4,2012 - Great action,"This movie is just a fun movie, lots of action, little story, and lots that you say, NO WAY!! But. fun and entertaining."
1,More than one Blu Ray Profile,"I purchased my Sony Blu ray Player a couple of years ago and I have wondered why some blu ray movies will play and some will not. It turns out that MY Sony player can only play certain movies ( Profile 1 ) The problem not is that the movies are not labeled so .... I had to return this movie because it wouldn't play on my player.The Good news ... Amazon prepaid to return it and gave me a complete refund against my Credit card. So ... Movie ""F"" ....Amazon ""A+"" . Blu Ray movies should be labeled and shame on Sony because they knew this when I paid top dollar for the unit."
2,DO NOT WASTE ALMOST 3 HOURS OF YOUR TIME,"We didn't know how long this movie was when we rented it. After it ended, I had to look it up because it seemed neverending. ALMOST 3 HOURS! Could I have found a worse way to spend 3 hrs? Yes. Wish I had. What a waste of time."
4,Wholesome family entertainment!,But results may vary with your family. Pretty dark premise suitable to totally freak out any kid under 10 years old. My 16 and 12 year old kids loved it. Great special effects. Corny humor like an old 50s drive in horror flick. Totally unbelievable coincidences of people falling out of the sky crash landing a plane within walking distance of the exact place across the planet they were trying to find with a road map. Anyway...highly recommend it. But not if you're looking for deep insights into why Mayans could track the alignment of our solar system with the center of the Milky Way.
3,"Poseidon Adventure, but World Sinks and Boat Floats","This is a remarkably silly film, going from the preposterous to the totally unbelievable without apology. It does, however, have great special effects. It is worth watching for the effects, but lacks any credibility or grand message. A good time wastyer or film to watch on a long journey.I give it 3 stars, but that should not be taken as negative. It is just not a must see movie. If you know any science at all, try to forget it before watching."
2,2012 DVD,"I watched the entire movie and not only is it noisy the whole way through...you felt like this movie was in a hurry to end & a lot of the effects made the mission of survival look corny as heck, not to mention totally impossible. I guess it's a good enough sci-fi movie..but it wasn't worth a higher ranting. Was not impressed. And I love John Cusack...he's good in almoist any movie. I say, save your money...this ads for this video are all hype as there is little to back their claims up."
2,2013 meet 2012,This movie was cool... before it was 2013. Now it's just another movie about a disaster that was supposed to happen but didn't so we can look forward to a remake the next time we think the world is going to end. The 2 stars are for Woody being in the movie.
2,dumb,"The first half of the movie is one spectacular disaster after another. Lots of falling buildings, explosions, hairbreadth escapes; a really good popcorn movie. Then they had to go and ruin it in the second half with moronic characters, machinery designed to fail and a fake politically-correct morality that covers the second half of the movie like decayed mayonnaise. Please."
4,Special Effects 8 stars - Plot 0 stars,"I was seeing the movie for the first time. The BluRay transfer is excellent and my subwoofer walked across the hardwood floor. It's a great movie to play loud. I'm a tech freak so I could really appreciate the special effects. I can't get enough of seeing LA and NYC getting destroyed. However, even for me that couldn't really offset the lack of plot. The main characters were simply running away from impending doom (always just one step ahead). The plot was too much like Day After Tomorrow, War of the Worlds, or Cloverfield, i.e., thin. If you like apocalyptic destruction than this is for you. If you want a fresh plot line with interesting character development, than look elsewhere."
3,"Overlong, but entertaining CGI Cheese",Silly. Too long. Corny. It reminded me a bit of the old Irwin Allen movies with a dash of the 10 Commandments. That's not necessarily a bad thing. If your looking for something goofy and over-the-top it does the trick. Of course the best thing about it is that the little doggie survives.
4,Lots of adrenaline!,"If you don't like to spend an entire movie sitting on the edge of your chair, shouting ""Oh no, oh no, oh no!"" Then this isn't the movie for you! But if you enjoy such suspense and adrenaline packed adventure, then this is perfect!First, the acting was fine. But this isn't what this movie is about. Excellent actors were cast and did their job, but what made this film really good was the incredible special effects. If there were a few story holes or the storyline was a bit simple (we were able to predict with 100% accuracy who would die and when, and sometimes even the coming facial expression or last words -- it was pretty predictable) -- who cares? We felt like the plot was comfy old shoes to rest in while we watched awesome effects.The premise is that in 2012, the world will end. That is no spoiler. But how it happens is well worth watching. California drops into the sea! Tsunamis cover India and most of the world. Will anyone survive? Watch and see!"
2,Deceptive advertising,"Item advertised a digital disk as well as Blu-ray. The disk that comes with it had an unlock code that expired over a year ago. Might as well just buy the item with the 1 disk, the rest was worthless."
1,This movie is SOOOOO stupid on so many levels.,"Disregarding the plot (which can be debated all day), this movie speeds away from any thread of reality or scientific fact like a Bugatti Veyron Super Sport (top speed 267MPH).The writers seemed to have one theme; make any encounter with anything as close as possible to the point of being unbelievable.....and then repeat it about 50 times! Add millions in digital effects and there's your movie!Both airplanes would have ""conked out"" as soon as any of the volcanic ash reached it. And the vehicles, give me a break. Both the father and daughter would have broken their backs when landing in a flimsy motor home, but it didn't even blow a tire!This movie is simply a venue to show off special digital effects. That's it."
1,Nothing New,"It can be summarized in one sentence "" Once you have seen one filmfrom Emmerich; you have seen all of them."""
4,Compatibility issues,"The programming of this disc seems to be very advanced - you could say it is too advanced. The film plays fine, but the audio commentary track is not compatible with my player, an OPPO BDP-83 SE. I've never seen anything like that before. I work with authoring myself, and all audio tracks should be accessible through the remote control, which is a big help if the programming fails."
5,All Judgements Aside....2012 is a FUN Movie!!,"2012 is not about the storyline. 2012 is just about having a good time! Look back at all of the disaster movies...they are all about the jaw dropping special effect(Exception would be Titanic) I know the movie will not be as good on my home television as it was on the big screen, but I am still going to buy it. There is a decent story line but some parts of it are unbelieveable. Best advice for anyone sit back, shut up, and prepared to be wowed!"
5,2010 Movie & Time for Miracles by Adam Lambert Video,"Shipped and arrived in excellent condition and on time. Loved the movie, sat on the edge of my seat for most of it. Absolutely loved Adam Lambert's video at the end, Time For Miracles. !!!"
1,2012,"very bad movie, with some stupid scenes. no translation to spanish language or evensubtitles. I give to friend of mine because I want to see no more in my life!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"to date, the worst movie of the new century",officially awful. i almost hung myself. you hold out hope that it might get better but just gets worse with every passing minute.
3,A Bit Too Animated!,"It was a good movie demonstration of the Destruction that is sure to take place on Earth...but it was Hollywood, Paramount, etc. If one is going to present something as real as the end of the World at least tell the Truth as it is written in Scripture(the Bible). The World as we know it will be destroyed but not by WATER!!The only safe place is in JESUS NAME! Not a steel-Plated Ark! The Ark has landed, and is done,the destruction will be by FIRE this time. And the SAVED will be all those who have made themselves ready in this life as we know it and made a real change of life towards living for God contaray to public opinion the end of all things is REAL!!"
1,"""There's got to be a morning after...""","Couldn't stop laughing & groaning... but it felt so right! The special effects are completely drowned in the unending string of ""almosts"" that Cusack & Co. squeak through while others just mindlessly perish around them. Worst of all: The icky treacle of ""love"" moments b/t the odd & sundry future of humanity. These are the people that will re-populate Earth? Oy! By the time the full-on POSEIDON ADVENTURE calamity was in full swing - hope had long been abandoned."
3,Blaspheme not good,"I like the catastrophic events and some of the actors. But the story is basically the same, divorce, separation, kids, new husband. The actors some are good some have weak performance. What I don't like is the blaspheming of John Cusak and in front of a child."
1,One of the worst movies of all time if not ever...,This movie is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever made .It is so ridiculous and implausible. Its even so bad that its not even one of those movies that is so bad that you enjoy it anyway. Its worse than that. Its two hours of my life that I'll never get back......... Don't just avoid this movie RUN AWAY SCREAMING.....
2,2012???,"Did not play in my blu ray player, or any other of my players.BUT after i downloaded an update for my Blu Ray player it decided towork. Than Amazon wanted the Movie back so I sent it back to them.Need to explain to people as to what kind of equipment they need to play these movies on."
1,Waste of time and money....,"I can't claim to have seen every terrible film in cinematic history, but in my fairly extensive watchography, 2012 is certainly in the top 5 worst ever."
4,ultimate disaster,"This film is by far the best disaster movie I have seen, Special effects are outstanding"
3,interesting,This movie was ok. The visual special effects were incredible. The story so so. You knew what was goingto happen before it did. Woody once again was the best character in the movie.
1,Another implausible Craptacular,"Wretched, bogus, implausible, horrible, badly written, plastic characters, a circle jerk of chicles, really, really bad science and the worst ending in the history of movies.Neutrinos that heat up the earths core? The writer should be beaten to death with a physics book.Fails the science, barely pases for fiction.Skip it or watch it for computer generated graphics- the best part of the movie.The CGI is all this crappy, craptacular crapfest has to offer.Don't be a fool and buy it at retail. Wait till it's on the $5 rack in Walmart before you add this turd to your collection. Better yet, flush it."
1,Movie of lies,"This movie is complete crap! NOBODY knows when the ""End Of The World"" is gonna come.The Mayans never even said the world would end or any kind of disaster would happen on 12/21/12.Just some phony pagans took the Mayan calender ending and blew it up into something COMPLETLY different.It's not even logical.Time zones are different all around the world.So 12/21/12 is not REALLY 12/21/12.For the other side of the world it could be 12/22/12 or 12/20/12.Those of you who buy into this 2012 crap,should stop and think about that,before getting all scared."
1,Are you guys serious?,"I'll keep this short. I love movies, including disaster ones, but this one has to be the absolute most ridiculous waste of talent ever assembled. It's not even worth discussing all the examples of stupidity in this movie, but if you are looking for a lot of laughs (what a sad comment to make since practically the entire human population dies here), this is the place to go because almost everyone in the theater kept on saying ""are they serious?"" as the 'heroes' kept escaping everything mother nature threw at them. Throw in every stereotype under the sun and you have another Hollywood extravaganza thought up by some people high on drugs. Save your money."
2,Good Special Effects--Bad Movie,"2012 is a rip off. The special effects are decent; although very ridiculous in many places. The story-line is typical of the big budget end-of-the world flick (an absurd love story replete with long-sufferng children, the jilted lover--who obviously has to die heroically-- and the ""got-you-back-again"" husband). It's worth watching for the laughs, in fact it is going to become one of our groups ""must see"" films during our annual Thanksgiving trip to Gatlinburg. We'll be adding this one to a couple of other ""wonderful"" films such as Donte's Peak (ummm, people stew) and The Mummy (E-mo-tep). Oh yeah...lots of destruction--that's we like."
2,Not again! How can Hollywood be so dumb!,"I thought this movie looked pretty cool, and had potential. I was rather heavily disappointed. While the story is good, and the effects very good, the cheese in this thing is over-ripe, and incessant. One million times throughout people escape disaster with less than a half second to spare, what the hell is that? At least give us an inkling that this could be realistic please. Apparently film execs take the movie going public to be brainwashed half-assed thrill seekers, and in many cases are quite right, but the oohs and aahs that they think are gold in this pic are more like ooh I am going to puke if you do it again within the next minute. They do it four times more. `Nuff said?"
2,Faint praise: I didn't turn it off...,"I am going to keep this short. This was not the worst movie I have ever seen, however it was pretty bad. The story line was... well... ridiculous. The special effects were too over the top. Throughout the entire film I kept thinking the effects, while on one level were impressive, they were so unrealistic that they suspended my 'suspension of disbelief'. The movie really did deserve one star, but as I recently sat through ""Furry Vengeance"" I could not in good conscience lump it at the same level."
2,"Fantastic Spectacle, Weak Story -","2012 is another end of the earth film, however this time with the best special effects I have seen. The story is weak, however, the characters help it out a lot despite their absurd dialogue. The action is fast and furious and the two hours seem to go by fairly fast.The theory behind the movie's end of the earth scenario is weak and somewhat altered from what the History Channel's ""End of the Earth"" series spouted.This may end up being a ""campy"" film - it is so preposterous at times - sort of a finely tuned trashy spectacle. Looking back, it may be an inside joke, and looking back it gives me great belly laughs"
4,no subtitles in spanish,"Whath happens with sony pictures? This movie is a very good popcorn movie, but without audio and subtitles in spanish. Only for that i dont buy this movie.Que fallo Sony. Los estudios Disney te estan comiendo los dulces. Ellos si doblan sus peliculas y les ponen subtitulos."
1,worthless,"This movie is basically a bunch of CGI catastrophic disaster sequences with just enough of a story wrapped around it to commercially release it as a film. The director seems to have wanted to do a modern noah's ark story. But rather than anything biblical, we get Mayan prophecy, a pseudoscience driven collapse of the earth's crust and arks built by the rich/powerful for themselves.The film features bad acting, unlikeable characters and a plot that only serves as filler between CGI disaster sequences. Oh. And if the world ever looks like its going to end, just head for Africa. Even Mayan prophecy doesn't apply to Africa."
3,2012,This movie has lot of action and if you blink you will miss what is going on. It really hit what might to the world.
1,BAD movie - HORRIBLE movie,"This may be the worst movie I have ever seen. The director and writers tried to create excitement with computer generated special effects over and over again. When will the movie producers learn that it takes more than just special effects to make a good movie. If you are expecting a movie similar to Indenpendance Day, you will be saddly disappointed. If you must see this movie, then rent it in DVD format - Blu-ray only makes it worse. If I coud give this movie ""no stars"" then I would."
4,Pretty Intense!,"This is not what I would call one of my absolute favorite movies, but it was a pretty intense watch. This is not the way I believe the end of the world will come about...I believe in the Biblical end times, but it's a cool fantasical end of the world movie. It would totally suck to be around if a disaster of this magnitude ever struck. Again, not the most amazing movie in my book and not entirely the way I believe the end will come about, but still a very entertaining and intense watch. I would recommend it."
3,ok,I mean it was ok. Entertaining for as long as it lasted. Wouldn't watch it again. I hope it's not true :)
4,Great movie,"I loved the top notch special effects. I saw how California would slide into the ocean, a super volcano explode, and an ocean break over the Alps. Good acting, fast paced movie. I probably would have given it 5 stars but I took one star away because I don't think anybody would stop in the middle of an epic emergency to explain it all to his kids no matter how much he loves them, before acting to save their butts. Still, I think it's one of the best movies I've ever seen."
5,Amazing movie!,This is an amazing movie and an amazing DVD! I'm glad that I bought it and the price was GREAT!!
3,"Oh brother , not another flying wonder","As ""End of life as we know it"" it was ok . At times it was actually like a really bad written soap opera with predictable effents , the dialogue was barely tolerable, I laughed a number of times at the sholky acting. Special effects are good ."
4,It was a good movie,I can't say I LOVE the movie. But it was good or okay I guess. I was just curious to know what's in the movie since it talks about the 2012 disaster. That's why I bought it. Neither I love the movie a lot nor I hate it.
2,Not a great Disaster movie to watch,"Not a great disaster movie to watch. They tried to mix romance and disaster together and couldn't do it well.In the movie , you have to wait for the disaster scene to come....One time watch .....Some of the disaster scenes are great..."
2,Fantastic CG and but that's about it,"OK, I could maybe believe the limo scene but after that it goes downhill in a hurry. First of all, if I want to watch a disaster movie, at least make the peripheral parts believable.First of all, we have an unlicensed pilot with one lesson fly a twin engine plane with 4 passengers to Montana from California then make a perfect 3 point landing on a primitive supposedly secret uncharted airstrip..AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN NO WAY NO HOW!Then at the end, we have 2 or 3 arks or whatever (I lost interest by that time) built high up in the Himalayas or wherever by the Chinese. So tell me how you were going to build such large sophisticated machinery that these arks obviously were supposed to be in a remote area with primitive mountain roads as the only means of hauling large heavy equipment?Watch this movie for the terrific CG graphics and forget the rest of the nonsensical story line."
2,Good Disaster Movie... but what about the subtitles?,"I liked it... Great special effects and good Disaster movie. I would have bought it, but really? just French and English Subtitles? What about Spanish Subtitles? Spanish is the second most common language in the US, it holds the world's fifth largest Spanish-speaking population, outnumbered only by Mexico, Spain, Argentina, and Colombia.I like subtitles because it helps me (not always) read in other languages (especially Spanish, French, Italian, German and Portuguese) while watching and listening movies. And I bet some potential buyers would still need those subtitles to watch the movie."
