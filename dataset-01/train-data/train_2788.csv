2,Terrible,"Absolutely awful dialogue, which made it nigh unreadable. I will say, if I were to imagine how an upper class doctor would think gang members spoke and acted, I would imagine the portrayal as seen in Contagion. A meandering, at-best farfetched plot and conclusion adds up to a book that was just mindblowingly bad. The second star is because I know I couldn't have done better."
2,remember back when Cook wrote *good* books?,"I'm 3/4 of the way through this one and again rather disappointed. Cook ued to be on my must read list, and although I have fallen behind I don't feel like I'm missing much. Starting with Blindsight and continuing in Contagion his characters spout cliches like they were fresh and talk to each other with dialogue meant merely to propel the scene, or worse, they speak pure exposition. Whenever a line starts with ""my problem is..."" you know you are in trouble. The plot, as usual with Cook's medical thrillers is compelling and raises some justifyable issues in regards to hospital care, medical advertising and the easy availablity of dangerous bacteria, but the flat out bad dialogue sinks the book like German sub in a WWII movie."
1,UGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!,"A teacher at school gave me a couple of Robin Cook books to read in my spare time and I picked Contagion out because of the cover. (Boy, did I ever prove that old saying right!) By the time I finished this book, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Why did Mr. Cook go off on so many tangents? His descriptions of the gang friends and gang language make you think that gangs aren't all that bad and their leaders are regular Patton's and Eisenhower's. Yuck. This book needed help."
2,Not Cook's Best By Far,This was one of those books that I just could not finish. I skimmed through the last 100 pages just to get a general idea of how the story ended. I agree with many other readers here that the plot lines are just totally implausible (I live in a small midwest town and even I know gang members do NOT talk or act like that) and the dialog is extremely leaden and awkward. Robin Cook has written much better books than this!
4,An Interesting Medical Thriller,"Personally, I quite enjoy reading Medical Thrillers and would say that Contagion was a fun read. The plot and the characters are well built and the story moves on an interesting pace. Although at times I got a little lost due to the Medical Jargons and reference to specific bacteria, I never lost track of the plot and enjoyed the book from front to back. Would definitely recommend this book."
2,Should have been a short story....,"If you take out all of the medical jargon, sophisticated wording, and needless daily details, there's actually not much story. I have read several of Mr.Cooks novels and I was disappointed at what a slow read this was. I think I read teal whole book waiting for it to get better. It did, it was just at the last ten pages. Not worth the $8."
1,"In the middle of the book, the whole trama are reveal","The mistery are weak and disapointed.You end up with feeling that maybe wasn't Robin Cook that wrote the book.I Use to love his books, but after this one, I will stop reading him for a while."
2,Not one of his better books,"This book started quite well. The characters were interesting and the plot was exciting. However, the book went all wrong with the suprise ending. It didn't fit with the rest of the book at all. The timing given for the villains deeds did not collaborate with actions at the beginning of the book.It felt like he hurried up and stuck an ending to the book. I was very disappointed."
3,Great until the end,"This was a great read, right up until the climax near the end and then what a let-down. Unpredictable maybe but it seemed a very weak and perhaps hurried finish to the book. Despite this I still enjoyed the bulk of the story. Informative, interesting and a scary proposition"
2,Mediocre,Taste is good if you like vinegar based hot sauce. It's not very spicy; perhaps the pepper sauce novice would like it.
4,A new view on the end of roman culture in Spain,"Professor Kulilowski makes use of recent archeology to chart the course of the rise and fall (or transformation rather) of cities in Spain. And not just the towns themselves, but the larger territories that were part and parcel of the Roman 'civitas'. He argues interestingly and well that the timing and pace of transformation in Spain from classic to Christian, from Roman to Visigothic requires this updating. He notes that archeological evidence in Spain has been allowed to speak for itself only in the last 20 years or so, and it now paints a different picture than the one held for most of the 20th century. He also authoritatively reviews the literature, around which a certain narrative has been built in the past, in light of the new archeological evidence."
1,No one in my book club liked it (or even finished it),"I think the title of my review says it all...unfortunately, no one in my book club had any interest in it."
4,I was prepared to HATE it... LOL,"I don't like changes. I want the next Heaven Lee mystery in the series YESTERDAY. But I caved and bought this book recently. It is a great read. Well written, thoughtful plot, interesting and tough female characters. So I promised myself, even though I don't like change, I will order and read the next book in the ""Spice Box"" series. The second book has a new heroine and yet another historical time period, but I will trust that I will enjoy the works of this author! :-)"
3,"Enjoyed the 19th century New York historical context, but...","Light reading, and a good old fashioned ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" kind of mystery. Characters are fun. I was distracted by the simplistic writing and even a few flaws that apparently were missed in the editing process. I was disappointed to find 21st century conversations in a 19th century context. Three men would never casually discuss pregnancy and abortion in front of a woman in the 1860s. Otherwise, the book was a reasonable afternoon of entertainment on a damp, cold winter day."
2,blood pressure monitor,"I found this product to be inferior to my previous one. I was quite surprised that it did not include a plug in re-charging feature. Battery life is much too short for such a product. I wanted to return it immediately and the on-line information said that this product was ""unreturnable."" I had to go out and buy another and ""lost"" all the money I'd send for this product.MD in LF, CA"
4,BP Monitor Review,"I have been very satisfied with the monitor. It is easy to use and seems to be quite accurate. I was disappointed to find when I opened the box that there were no instructions included. A quick phone call had them on the way. I was able to use it without the instructions but could not set the time, etc. All-in-all it is a quite satisfactory device."
2,"Worked for a while, then it died","This worked for a year or so. Maybe a grand total of 25 readings. It sat in the closet for another year or so before trying again and it was dead. It would not inflate. There are no visible leaks and no attempt to inflate, so the problem appears to be something internal."
1,I returned mine,"I was very disapointed by this product. It promises the right set of features, but it fails to deliver.1. The package contains no user manual. I looked for a web site everywhere on the package and the quick guide; I could not find it. Actually as I write this, the package sits on its side, and I finally discover the web site adress located under the box. But who keeps the box after a purchase?2. The very brief Quick Start guide (a two-sided 4""x6"" piece) does not say how to set the clock. Isn't it the first thing a user would like to do?3. There is no on/off switch, and the START button is very sensitive. So when you put the monitor in its pouch in a bag, it is more than likely that the unit will start to inflate on its own.4. My set of 4 AA batteries lasted less than a week! There is no power supply nor any indication on how to order one!5. The readings were much higher than the doctor's unit.So I returned my unit."
2,Eh...,"I didn't really enjoy this book. First, there were ... errors in it. Michael did not heal Liz. Anyone writing a book about Roswell should know that. Also, I didn't like the interaction between Liz and Tess. Yes, I am not a Tess fan, but I didn't like how she walked on Liz at all. It wasn't how it happened in the show, and that really bothered me. As for storyline, the book was pretty good. If you've never seen the show, you will probably like it. If you're a die hard fan of the show, and little mistakes drive you insane, or if you aren't a big fan of Tess, this probably isn't the book for you."
4,Gender and the Environment from and EcoFeminist Prespective,I think this is a great beginner book to learn about ecofeminism. The book is laid out very well and it is easy to understand.
3,2 and 1/2 really...,Bruce and Stan mean well. I believe this is their 50th commentary and it's fine withen its field. I have yet to find the 1 guide to The Bible.
5,Well done,"Bruce and Stan have a way of making the subject easy for all of us to understand.They don't waver on what the Bible says, but explain what others believe quite well. ."
3,"more standards, less synth","the telepathic interplay of this trio rivals the best in jazz. however, despite 4 oustanding standards this recording falls short of a strong recommendation due to the inclusion of many tunes featuring abercrombie of synth guitar. if you like this kind of thing, it's great. i find it not very interesting and grating. i LOVE abercrombies' playing and would have preferred to hear him just play his virtuosic electric instead. oh yes, it's also live and recorded at low volumes."
2,"Nice tool, but blades are very brittle & break easily","I snapped the end of the blade off this tool within my first hour of use. I was cutting a branch and twisted the shear a bit to try to break the branch off and the blade snapped in two.While twisting the tool may not be a good practice, I have never broken a blade before on any tool - most of which cost 3.99. The bigger problem is finding replacement blades. None of my local retailers carry them nor, ironically, does Amazon.I would choose another tool with better, more widely available blades."
4,Gardena first - found surprise,"Love the looks, hope they work as well or better than my Fiskars. I was looking at hand-pruners yesterday, visited this site and actually ordered the 601 [lighter duty] model because it was on sale. Then I cancelled the order because the shipping was costly, wanted to see them first-hand or learn more. Last night while walking the dog, I heard a car drive over something that sounded strange - as if fallen from the sky, low and behold, something better than I wanted, something like a delightful answer to a prayer, Gardena 343 shears, none the worse for wear, a few dings, I look forward to field testing them... I suspect a local landscaper will miss them!"
2,THIS CAMERA IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!,"I bought this camera my birthday and thought it was great. A couple months later, I began to notice that the sound skips, and it would constantly eat tapes. And then it goes on some sort of safety mode where it wont let you do anything on the camera because it thinks it might break itself. And whats up with all that extra space around the flip screen? I should have done more research before I bought this camera, and now im paying the price."
1,Heaven forbid your's should ever need repair,"Mine did: three times. They lost it for weeks. For the 6 months I have owned it, I have had it for about two. Panasonic dragged its feet until I had my attorney call them."
4,Terrific Movie,Jeremy Sisto gives a beautiful performance. Character-driven drama without gimics or predictability. Wonderfully quiet film. Solid supporting cast.
4,Into Temptation,"A good but sad movie. Even though sad, it portrays real human emotion. Sisto is great. Loved the movie."
4,Great little guide,"I picked this up before my last trip to Japan to help me navigate some of the subways. This book has excellent maps and some very detailed close-ups of some of the most congested parts of the city. Large landmarks like banks, government offices, museums, parks and stations are all marked for easy identification. The book is large enough to provide better help than most travel guides, but still small enough to prove more useful than the large, folding maps. I highly recommend."
3,"Great tool, but some mistakes","I am a biblical languages student and have found this book to be most helpful in my translation work. However, my classmates and I have come across an alarming (but not overwhelming) amount of errors, especially in the parsing of verbs. Interestingly, one of my professors has an older edition of the book (sorry, I don't know which one) and it seems to not have the mistakes that occur in the newer version. In spite of the occasional errors, I would still recommend this book, especially to beginning students. I would also recommend having a lexicon on hand as well to make sure Rogers and Rogers has gotten it right. Also, if you can find an older edition of the book, I would suggest going with that."
3,Adobe Fireplaces,"This was one of the more helpful books I have read on adobe fireplaces. I have had a hard time finding books on this topic, and when I do, they are usually not of much help in the matter. This book on the other hand explained, very well, what I will need and how I should do it."
3,decent documentary,"This documentary is primarily worth it for Governor John Connally's last filmed interview. There is alot of familiar footage regarding 11/22/63; no major revelations. Still, worth it for your burn-to-dvd collection.Vince Palamara"
5,#1 dvd,"This vol. starts to tlak more about the characters past, they go on a mission to destroy this beast that is on the loose, now omi,yoji,ken, and the wonderful aya, must set out to hunt this guy down and deny this evil beast their tomorrow....""knights hunters, deniy this evil beast their tomorrow""quote from head of the agency"
3,Papo Leopard,"I don't know if I got a strange 2nd quality piece, but this plastic animal was not what I expected from Papo. Yes, it is durable, yes it is educational, yes, it could be fun; but aesthetically, it is less than desirable. I have the Black Leopard which is lovely. It is from the same mold and the detail is wonderful. They have painted black-on-black spots and it has wonderful greenish eyes, with well placed pupils. The plastic is almost odorless. The regular leopard (this toy) is an odd brownish color, with no white on it like pictured. The paint job on the nose is crooked. The picture is nice, but mine wasn't like this at all. If you are getting a Papo plastic animal - the lioness or black leopard are great as are the dinosaurs. The dodo is out of this world, but not such a nice fantasy piece for a child. All of these I bought from a store rather than through the mail. Perhaps buying in person would be advisable with Papo."
1,Fret Buzz,I would like to give this guitar a good review but I can't. First thing the guitar looks great and has a nice hardshell case. The guitar came not set up at all. It was so far out of tune that it took me 30 minutes just to get it in tune and to get the floating brigde level so I could play chords in tune. Then the first and second frets had the worst fret buzz I've ever heard. Can't even play anything on the first 2 frets. The guitar sounds good but is unplayable coming from the factory setup. I will be returning to Amazon.
1,Very Disappointed with Amazon,"I have purchased MANY items from Amazon over the last few years, and I have to say, I have never been disappointed, until now. This review is more directed to Amazon, than this guitar, a Dean Dimebag Razorback Explosion, which I'm sure is awesome! My son found this online here a few days ago and put in his cart until he could get the money to purchase it. The guitar was $514. He had that money today and went to purchase it and found out it had increased to over $800. He contacted Amazon and they said they could not do anything about it! I am very disappointed that someone can advertise a product here at one price and then just a few days later, raise the price over $300 for the same item! I may not be purchasing again from Amazon."
4,Concert from the folk revival era,"I have listened to this for 25 years now, and always come back to it. The CD consists of Lightnin solo, Sonny and Brownie together, and then all 3 jamming together. Lightnin tells stories to the responsive crowd and is in good form. Sonny and Brownie take you back to a real country feel --the harp playing is wild. Overall I'd give this 5 stars, but then what would I give to each artist's other gems? Sound is excellent by the way -highly recommended!"
2,Slider!,"If you keep your home well air conditioned and not too warm in the winter, you will love this butter dish. The first time I used it the butter slipped out into the water. Maybe an ice cube in the water might keep the butter from slipping out. Any advice, let me know."
2,Watery Mess,"The first time it worked good but now I can't get the butter to stay in the right part of the container. It keeps falling out into the water the minute I lift the butter container part off. The butter falls out, splashing into the water making a mess."
2,slow and small,It took 2 weeks after I ordered the hat for the company to even ship it. I recieved it after the arrival date. When I did finally recieve it turns out that their idea of a large is everyone else's small.
2,Poor Resolution,"I have seen the film numerous times and wanted to order another copy for an event. The copy I received was so grainy it was hard to view. Too bad, since I was looking forward to showing it during the 45th Anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery march."
3,It's okay but...,"It was okay, I was kinda expecting a little more Johanna Lindsey because of the time period. Nonetheless, the story was okay. I may re-read only if I can't remember what the book was about. So this is a no time soon read for me."
5,Great for the Pets,"We have an older dog with arthritis that was on aspirin. This doesn't have the harsh side effects that aspirin does ans she manages it very well. Definitely helps her with the pain since she doesn't cry out when she has it. Must taste bad from her expression, but with a nice treat she's OK with taking it with no fuss. I'm planning on trying it for a headache someday and see how it works for people."
3,Liquid White Willow Bark,I do not think this works as well for me as the capsules. One dose is pretty much one full dropper. That gives about 15 servings per bottle. The flavor is horrible if you decided to take this under the tongue. I am sticking with the capsules.
3,Not sure,The affect of this is supposed to mimic aspirin. I still am not sure if it really works or if it's my subconscious talking.
3,Not sure it works,"I saw this advertised on the Dr. Oz show as a relief for herniated disks. I have a herniated disk in my neck and I'm doing everything to avoid surgery. It's questionable if I get relief or not. I still hurt but I think there might be a minor change, so subtle I'm not sure. I find it hard to believe that Dr. Oz said it actually can prevent surgery. It doesn't taste that bad. I guess I might have to take it more regularly to see if it makes more of a difference but it's hard to remember to find time in the day to carry it and squirt it in water when you're out and about. The pill version would be better, but I found out it really did nothing."
4,"A tough, usefull tool.","I bought this to use when camping/hiking/hunting. I has proven useful and much more durable than the standard wooden handle model. My kids haven't broken it yet and it shows no rust! The saw is good for small camping/woods tasks like removing small limbs that are in the way.My only small complaint is that is hard to find when you drop it in the dark and the texture of the handle somehow keeps reflective tape (my solution to finding it in the dark) from sticking very well. I ended up putting on a bright colored lanyard.Overall, a good practical addition. I will probably buy another one to keep in my truck."
1,Weak sheath,"Within six weeks of use (chopping firewood for camping) the sheath for the blade has become badly chipped away, with slivers of wood getting between it and the blade, exposing a large portion of one side of the blade. I do not believe the axe is safe to use and am returning it to Gerber for warranty replacement."
1,Poor Quality,"I really like Gerber products but this one took me by surprise. First thing I noticed was that the axe was dull as dull could be. Then I put the saw in the handle and it was loose, I fear one attempt at chopping would send it flying out of place. It is only held in by one magnet. The sheath seemed ok, but the overall distribution of weight was way off too. The handle is plastic and not high quality at all. Again I'm a Gerber fan but I am surprised at how cheaply this is made. It is cute but as far a functional, I don't trust it. I certainly didn't anticipate a dull axe and cheap plastic. I'll be sending this back as the handle just now feel out when I carried it thru the house. Glad I had shoes on.I don't recommend the product at all."
5,gerber combo ax II,"A very well made ax and saw combo, ax head is heavy enough to split good size pieces of wood or fell a tree. Saw will do up to 6 in branches easily. Great addition to any camping outfit."
4,Awesome axe; decent saw.,"The axe is super sharp & holds an edge well. The longer handle gives it more power over the short model that is available. It makes axe work enjoyable.The saw works, but...The saw in the handle likes to work it's way out & rattle while using the axe - it is held in place only by a tiny magnet. I remove it while hiking, and while using the axe. I am surprised I have not lost it yet, and would not replace it if lost. IMHO, get a solid axe and a Sven saw to compliment it's use. You can't get both capabilities on this tool."
1,Do not buy if you intend to use it,I purchased this product hoping for a quality item that was light weight. In the past I have always bought Estwing but thought I would give the Gerber a try. I liked the way it felt in my hand but noticed right off the bat that the magnets that keep the saw in place did not work well and I was always having to be aware of it falling out. After about a month of use the handle snapped completly off right below the head. I will stick with my USA made metal handled Estwing.
1,What a bummer,"I have a number of gerber knives, so I thought the excellent quality of those would translate well to their other products. Unfortunately, it did not in this case. I purchased this to add to my hike pack for camping and what not. Upon first using this axe to chop thru some ice this winter, the center portion of the blade chipped. It was completely useless after that. Although I guess I could have sawed thru the ice with the cool saw in the handle, I was to upset to even think about using it. For the price, not worth it. Unfortunate :("
5,Great Gerber Axe,This little axe could castrate a nat flying and will definitely make kindling out of smaller branches or small trunks. It also could be very useful during the zombie apocalypse.
4,Good for light work,"This is a great little tool to use when camping. It will hack through plenty of wood, with enough patience. I used it on a couple of camping trips this summer and it was extremely handy to have. It's tough enough, but like some of the other reviewers mentioned, it's a bit light for regular duty use. It has been useful for some lite trimming jobs around the house, too. In my opinion, the weight is a good compromise for backpack camping."
1,Poor quality product - chipped blade!,"I purchased this axe a while back, and threw it with my camping gear. Well, this weekend I got to using it, and opened it up and realized the the edge of the blade had a huge chip in it and it was very blunt on this part of the blade.Pretty much made this item worthless to me. I will be trying to get Gerber to replace it."
4,Great Combo and price,"This is exactly what I have been looking for. I bought online because of price compared to local. The weight ration is great for the size and the longer handle lets you chop at a pretty good sized branch. The saw is a little awkward to use so be careful you don't cut your hand if it gets in a bind, that's the only reason for a four star. Other than that I couldn't be happier."
4,Great Tool,I use this tool for backpacking and camping. It is a fairly lightweight tool for its usage. It's feels high quality that will take the punishment. I would consider this more for usage comparably to a hatchet rather than an axe.
1,"Sounds great, but badly executed","I ordered this hoping that it would be perfect for preparing deadfall wood for the fire at camp sites, but as soon as it arrived, it was clear that Gerber made this item look better than it will perform. The saw-in-handle design sounds great, but compromises the structural integrity of the handle. When chopping, you can imagine that the force is not all in one direction on the handle- it surges through the handle in multiple directions, including twisting. A hollow handle won't hold up long under these forces, and with a plastic material, catastrophic failure is possible.Secondly, the saw is a glorified steak knife. It won't handle anything that your multi-tool's little saw can't handle. I returned it and am replacing it with the 16-inch Estwing camp axe and a separate ""Sawvivor"" collapsible hacksaw. More expensive, but both get top reviews and will survive for years."
1,Not the quality I expected from Gerber.,"Looks pretty but the construction/design and quality are questionable. After getting the axe, I was concerned that the poor design would allow for the axe blade to fly off if the thin plastic 'holder' cracked. I researched the axe further and found some REI reviews that confirm that the design is flawed and that it breaks easily. I'll just need to be cautious of people around when chopping wood so that when it does fly off, no one gets hurt. Not the quality I expected from Gerber....especially for the price."
4,"Great product, has a minor hitch.","Came in as expected, the saw within the handle is VERY SHARP. It's not something you would find on a cheap swiss army-style knife, its strong and gets the job done, comes out of the handle easily. The only complaint I have is the sheath for the hatchet. It's a ""little bit"" of a hassle, considering it fits almost ""too perfectly"" that it takes getting used to when taking it off or putting it back on the blade (base of the handle tends to snag a little, ), but overall it doesn't stop me from recommending this product to others."
4,Good for the money,"Have carried this hatchet and saw hunting for the past several years, and it has seen multiple uses: clearing shooting lanes, etc. On mor ethan one occasion, the saw has been used as a bone saw for a successful hunt. It has held up admirably."
1,This is junk!!,"My son used it once and it broke, I will not buy this again and I recommend to whomever is reading this DO NOT BUY!!"
3,good axe but there are better ones out there,"I liked the axe until I tried my friend's Fiskars 7850. It was clearly a superior product. The positive about this hatchet is that it does have a saw embedded in the handle. If I could repurchase the product, I would definitely go Fiskars. I have not evaluated the Estwing hatchets."
1,"unsafe, what is Gerber thinking","No pros, all cons. First, this product comes in the plastic packaging the everyone hates and requires a knife to open it. The saw blade and axe blade are exposed for display inside the plastic packaging. This makes a slightly dangerous situation when tearing open the package itself. Second, the axe blade is a bit dull. Third, and importantly, the design of item and how it holds the saw blade in the handle of the axe is flawed and unsafe. Only a weak magnet holds the saw blade inside the axe handle. With a quick jerk of the handle I was able to easily disloge the saw blade as it when flying to the floor. I don't want an unsecure blade in the end of an axe I'm either using or carrying. I have a Gerber fixed blade knife and two Gerber pocket knives that i am very happy with. I am not, however, happy with this axe/saw combo. I don't recommend it and I'm sending it back."
4,Great value for the cost,"The axe is a little longer than a hatchet but way too short to be an axe so the demensions threw me off a little. Once you get used to it the heft is manageable and plenty to split up a decent sized log for kindling (I'm not talking big hardwood rounds but just fine for camping). The saw looks a little flimsy but it did a number of light duty jobs at the camp site just fine.The only things keeping this from being a five star product are the relative flimsyness of the axe handle and saw. I haven't had any issue with them yet but they do have a cheap feel to them. I guess sacrifices must be made to make a saw small enough to fit into the axe handle. All in all I would highly recommend this product for light duty camping, especially if you're doing it out of a smaller car and space is a concern."
4,very good camping and hiking tool,it worked really great when I needed to slice and dice some large pieces of wood. The only issue was that you need to take the hand saw out of the handle - otherwise the magnet may not keep the saw inside when you work with the axe.
3,"Good axe, imperfect duality","The GoodThe axe is highly practical for hiking, camping, aka portable use. It has a light handle, its unaffected by water, the holster is very secure and un-encumbering and the saw blade-knife is just the right size to be useful for cutting branches or something as small as rope or pine bows for bedding.The metal is the best I've ever seen. I used the back end of the hatchet to hammer a friend's hardware store generic hatchet into a log and it severely dented the the back end of his hatchet while leaving not even a scratch on the Gerber hatchet.The BadAlthough the knife has a strong magnet holding it in the hollow, yet highly sturdy, handle of the axe. This magnet does not hold the saw-knife during use of the axe."
3,The saw got lost!,The saw inside the ax is not that secure inside the axe so it was lost during a trip. The Axe itself is good and is still in good shape after 2 years and several camping trips.
4,Hatchet is a better name,"My first thought was a lot smaller than I thought it would be. I put this on my wish list and received it as a gift. I am very happy with it, the construction of it and the sheathe. Just a better name would be hatchet not axe other than that it is great."
5,A Facsinating Recording,"I will presume, if you have found yourself at this site, that you are familiar with the ""Hilliards"", with and without their eponymous founder. I was unfamiliar with this composer, I'm embarrassed to say, before I aquired this disc. I bought it because of the consistent quality of ""the band"", nor was I disappointed. Perotin has an extrodinary and exceptional voice. Of course, the performance is impeccable.If you enjoy music of the Renaissance (broadly defined), you will almost certainly treasure this disc.Enjoy."
4,surprisingly fresh,This surprisingly fresh collections of pieces is performed with fantastic attention to intonation. The voices of the ensemble blend with such delicate balance. It is a beautiful and envigorating experience.
1,"I ordered it new,is it used?","Caller is not loud enough,I went to change batteries and the terminals on the unit were rusted.Glad it works for some of you but I am returning mine,I paid for a NEW one,not USED."
5,Didn't take long at all...,"I bought this caller for my father's birthday (which was yesterday). Here in Western PA, the coyotes can be hard to see sometimes, let alone kill. We've had luck with mouth calls, electronic calls, and shooting them on the occasional lucky sighting. Regardless, after receiving it, my father took it out tonight to try it out, and within about an hour had shot a big black one. He had set up the caller about 50 yards away from his position and placed a stuffed animal beside the speaker...the coyote never even saw him.He already owned an electronic caller, but it was bulky, relied on cassette tapes and a heavy battery pack. It was a pain to lug around and set up. This caller is lightweight, handy, and it runs on simple AA batteries. It's not exceptionally loud, but it also won't unnerve the coyotes by blasting them with loud squawking.I give it five stars. A solid value for the money."
2,You get what you pay for.,"It was cheap and I thought I would give it a try.When you open the package and try it out for the first time, while still in the house, it sounds very loud. But take it outside, and it's another story. My neighbor, standing 2 doors down, said he could barely hear it. Trying to call Crows, 1/4 mile away or more is useless.The first morning I took it out to hunt, I set it on the ground and stood behind a tree about 25 feet away. The remote turned it on OK, but it would not change calls via the remote, and then it would not shut off via the remote.Besides the trouble with the remote not working very well, it just simply is not loud enough."
4,preditor call,I used this preditor call as soon as I got it and it worked the first time I went outgot 2 coyotes. am considering buying another one.
3,Stewart's remote crow call,"After call has run for about 30 seconds, it will not turn off with remote, have to turn off volume."
4,Preditor call,"This call is great, I wish it had more volume. I live in the country and have song dogs around my home a lot. I think I could have them in my yard with this call."
1,What a ripoff!!!!,"The card works ok, however I only have one card so I do not have a benchmark to compare its speed. The part I have a problem with is X-didital did not honor its rebate. I will never purchase another card from them."
3,"Too much unresolved emoting, but thought provoking drama.","If you're a fan of Wil Wheaton, this is one of his biggest, best roles. It's a drama about 5 prep boys debating weather to join up after Pearl Harbor. The whole thing takes place during one night, December 8th 1941. Wheaton is taking a pacifist position, putting his best friendship with a patriot at risk. These boys seem to have a new emotional crisis in every scene, and unfortunately that makes their competent acting seem a bit over the top, and about halfway through the film it loses it's effect. However, you'll probably like December if you liked all of the following movies, even if it isn't as good as any of them: Stand By Me, Toy Soldiers, Dead Poet's Society, and The Emperor's Club. Of course they never do resolve who is right, or even tell what happens to any of them in the war; but they raise thought-provoking issues, such as can friendship survive diametric positions of patirot vs. pacifist."
3,Since it was filmed where I went to colllege,"that was the only reason I got this movie. It's an alright movie, but not one I'd watch over and over again."
1,This camera stinks,"1. The auto /manual button broke down.2. Outdoors or in strong light, the LCD screen is very sensitive. Picture quality is blurred and unclear.3. Panasonic customer service stinks. They require you to pay to ship the camcorder for repairs and pay the shipping to receive your camcorder back. You have to ship it to Illinois. There is only a 90 day warranty. By that time your camcorder will probably need repair. Panasonic didn't even look at my camcorder and they say that it costs 160 dollars to repair -- parts are under warranty for a year -- this is only the cost for labor. In other words, to fix the camcorder, costs more than to buy it. Panasonic refuses to pay to fix camcorder because its after the 90 day. Visa refuses to pay to fix the camcorder.I strongly don't recommend this camcorder and Panasonic alltogether.Also buy a camcorder in a store where you can buy insurance on your camcorder. ..."
2,Color LCD is difficult to watch under sun-shine,"I bought this camcorder and a Canon Powershot G2 digital-camera as gifts for my parents. Before I mail them out, I did some tests first. Then I noticed a big problem with my camcorder. If you shoot it outside under good weather, you cannot see a clear image in the Color LCD. So you have to look at the black & White viewfinder. Then it will be difficult for you to shoot around. At first, I just thought maybe all LCD will not work in such a situation, but when I use my canon digital-camera, its LCD works very well. Finally, I decided to retrun this product and buy another relatively expensive Canon camcorder."
3,Don't plan on a simple bolt in.,"With the factory radiator in my 82 CJ-7 I had to drill a couple new holes in the fan mounts to make it work and the clearance between the fan and water pump was pretty tight. Shortly after this I had to replace the radiator and bought a high dollar aluminum radiator which required me to clearance the fan shroud for the inlet and outlet necks. Now there is definately not enough clearance and the bolts that are holding the water pump pulley on are hitting the fan. Still fabricating to make it work and haven't even started on setting up an automatic switch. Planned to run a temp switch in the lower radiator hose because it should be far more accurate than the probe stuck through the radiator but good luck finding a switch to fit flexalite's 1/4"" fitting. I'll probably have to cut it and weld in a 3/8"" or 1/2"". This fan and the aluminum radiator are definately going to keep it cool in AZ though...once I get it all fab'd together."
2,Not impressed at all,"well, not just that its so old, but, well, couldn't put my finger on it, just poorly done, is that enough?"
1,JUNK,This is junk. Taste like water. No comparison with others like Bonsai Espresso Blend Espresso from Veltons or even the one that sells in Whole Foods. Try different grind size (smaller size it gets better) and similar results. It goes to the garbage.
2,Not what it showed here. Instead a Websters Seventh Collegiate Dictionary!,"I ordered what I thought was a new Webster Ninth Collegiate Dictionary it is a Websters Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary, It is in very good shape but it is a 1969. The one I had is a 1974 and wanted to replace is in terrible shape. I really thought I was getting a newer one, my mistake I guess. Anyway it is not new but in good shape. It was misrepresented by being a seventh addition instead of a Ninth. Not happy about that."
2,you do get what you pay for,"When it arrived in the mail i opened it up and turned it on and very quickly learned two things... The solar function did not work at all and the battery that was in it was VERY low, lucky i had a battery laying around (a 1.55v 389 watch battery) to put in and now its just a battery powered calculator with a nice looking but totally useless solar panel on it but it still does what i need it to."
2,ok,My son's room is done in a baseball theme. Thought this would be a great addition. Not very bright though and he can't do the clock by himself
4,My son loves it,"This clock works well the display is very clear and my son was excited to see it glowing on the ceiling. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of is the settings it is not like most clocks where you have the hour, min, alarm buttons. It took a little bit to set it and there is no way a kid could change the time knowingly......... This could be a good thing though too. I really liked the clock."
1,Clock never worked,I was very disappointed in this clock. Everything about it feels cheap and it never worked. Thankfully Amazon is great and allowed us to return it with no problems.
3,Good Little Clock Not Sure About The Long Haul!,"I got this for my son's 10th birthday. He really likes it. I gave it a three because it does not seem to be one of the best made clocks. You do have to have the batteries in it to get it to work even if you have it plugged in which I found a bit annoying because I did not get batteries for his birthday! It may have said that in the description but I didn't read it:) Overall we like it, just not the best quality."
3,Horrible packaging!,"I bought this clock for my grandson. I have not yet given it to him so I cannot rate the clock. It is cute. I gave it 3 stars because it comes in the most wierdly shaped, thick, hard, plastic packaging that will be impossible to gift wrap unless I can find the right size box. This packaging is wasteful, is of synthetic materials, cannot be recycled and will add to landfills, and I know will be a struggle to open and may ruin a perfectly good pair of scissors. Why can't they just put it in a cardboard box and avoid all these bad things?"
2,no help,"There are two sentences on page 59 that sums up this book. They are, ""Begin by deciding how much risk is comfortable and then seek the optimum level of return at that point. ... An advisor can then construct a portfolio that has the highest possible expected return within that risk criteria."" The book touches on basic concepts and theories, but does little to help you figure out how to implement those theories. I found this book to be no help at all. I don't know if these other reviewers are friends of his, but I just don't understand giving this book 5 stars."
1,Not worth the money unless truly out of touch,"Easy to read, but a waste of your money unless you are truly unread on asset allocation, etc. This book is a jumble of topics. It covers a little bit of Wall St. history, mentions the early research that led to modern asset allocation approaches, and then presents one portfolio without any justification. The author talks about the return on this portfolio for a specific ""couple"" (real or imagined?). He includes a few tables in the Appendix that purport to show the yearly returns. There is no information that would help you create your own portfolio. The book takes a few swipes at Wall St. in general, and at the end tends to tell the reader to find an investment advisor to create your portfolio."
5,An excellent guide to intelligent investing.,"For years I've tried to make sense out of all the information and advice obtained from stockbrokers, books, magazines (and less authoritative sources) regarding how to best invest my savings for retirement. Finally I discovered and read Frank Armstrong. I felt at last I had found a professional who has remarkable knowledge, understanding, insight and experience in the investment business. His new book, 'The Informed Investor', puts it all together in the world of investing. He uses academic research, common institutional practices and years of real world experience to explain the underlying forces that govern global stock markets. His book is written in straight forward easy to understand language that allows all of us investors large and small to maximize returns with minimum risk over time. 'The Informed Investor' should be on every investor's reading list."
3,missing tracks,"I may be rehashing what's beens said about the missing tracks from the original vynil release but...The song ""SHY"" is also missing, which was the second track. These omission lessens the emotion impact and makes this just another mediocre compliation album...better than nothing but still, have they no shame?"
2,What Happened?,"The Photos released their debut eighties LP with one great, I mean REALLY great song, the kind of song that still sends chills up and down one's spine. That song, ""I'm So Attractive"", is, sadly, not on this CD, and neither is the original's other great song, ""Shy"". So what's left? Well, some OK stuff, most notably the reggae-tinged ""She's Artistic"", and a hummable mersey beat ""Maxine"". However, without the afore mentioned classic tunes to set the mood, you'd be much better off searching the out-of-print sites and auctions for the Photos' debut LP."
1,Slip 'n' fall,"The bucket that dumps never dumps at the right time. I mean slip'n'slides are fun but you should see how many people get hurt by these.(You say not many, do you watch the news or maybe you don't get out much.) (...)"
5,A summer soaking....,boy this water slide is the best! it gets you drenched in water if you have a lot of water pressure that is... but the tunner is nice to sit under if your tired and want to rest I have been using this everyday ever since it has been 90 degress out (which has been 2 weeks now) I really love this slide. I would recomend anyone who likes to get cooled off this slide it it the BEST!
2,Will not buy again,"I bought this slide in hopes the kids will enjoy it. The slide already came with holes. Even though it came with two patches to fix the holes,it had at least five holes when I opened the slide.It took an hour to assemble when to find out all the functions didn't work. This toy is way overpriced, It should be improved by being more durable.Will never buy again"
4,I need your copy,I haven't read this but would like to. Please email me if you can send me your copy. This may be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Thanks!
5,CAMELOT VISITS IRELAND,"The documentary features the very best of both worlds as a telegenic President visits the cradle of his ancestors and the country that was as close to his heart and affection as was his beloved USA. This is a nostalgic and sentimental journey to his beloved Ireland. There is alot of footage to witness how much JFK was beloved in this beautiful country.The haunting sound of a tenor voice that sings at the end is awsome. He sings"" ""Ill be on my way to a far away land, on the shores of America"" as a child , I watched this with my Mother and we were trully inspired at the pathos and the serenity of this momentous documentary.Noel SerranoJFK GroupHi5 Network"
2,A real disappointment.,"The romance between this couple was under-developed and unbelievable. While Emily's character was full and her motives understandable, Richard's character was sparsely developed. I wish the plot had been more straightforward instead of the many sub-plots which could have been interesting if fleshed out a bit more. The true enjoyment in this book is the relationship between Emily's parents. Since I enjoyed Ms. Ashford's other books very much, this one was a real disappointment."
4,Series 3,"Final series for 1993 Stadium Club, cards 601 to 750 to be culled from 240 cards. The front is kinda busy and the back features a one line comment about the player, a tiny reprint of the players rookie card is on the back.6 Hall of Famers and 3 members of the 3000 Hit club."
5,Excellent cards,"These cards have shown to be extremely reliable, and APC did a good job with the Firmware. Use with a AP9512TBLK for Temperature monitoring, or a AP9512THBLK for Temperature and Humidity monitoring."
5,Great Textbook!,"As a current Java student, we use this text in class, and I can say that it is a very good book. It has a great accompanying website which allows you you to download sample programs that are shown in the book. I highly recommend this book to any beginner or advanced programmer looking to learn Java."
4,I didn't enjoy this as much as Blades of Fate..,"Episodes 4-6 [included in Blood Rivals] are not as impressive as the first three episodes [included in Blades of Fate]. The story has developed solidly into a battle between ""unchecked brute force"" and ""balance and honor"", and still has enough to keep me interested, but I miss the freshness of the first few episodes. Most of the character development seems to have been sacrificed to plot and pacing. DVD has choice of both dubbed and subbed versions."
5,The Rocking Horse Winner,"D.H. Lawrence was a superb short story writer, and The Rocking Horse Winner is perhaps one of the greatest short stories ever written. The only other short story that is its equal is The Bet by Anton Chekhov. I would say more but that would be spoiling it for you. Let it suffice to say that Lawrence is now a much overlooked writer, however, his message of how modern industry is destroying all that is vital and natural in mankind is as poignant today as when he first wrote about it almost 100 years ago! So what's new?"
3,Worth A Read,"Honestly, I've never been an avid reader of DH Lawrence. This is not to say, I dislike him as a writer. Not true. The literature that I have read by him, most I've found interesting and good. It had been a while since I read any DH, until I picked up SELECTED SHORT STORIES. I picked it up primarily for the story ""The Prussian Officer."" I wasn't disappointed with the short story at all. It's quite a homoerotic story about a Captain and his subordinate, telling of DH and his other work in many ways. The story is compelling, yet tragic, which I liked. The other stories that followed didn't quite compare. I found the other's dry and verbose (especially ""Daughters of the Vicar""). I'd recommend this collection just for the ""The Prussian Officer."""
5,Sturdy and nicely machined,"I was pleased to see how nicely machined this was. Wow, I thought, there's really nothing like fine Italian workmanship...and then to my surprise I saw this gem was made in China. It's easily as well made as something from Manfrotto but the price is a bit easier to handle."
2,Carrying case more likely,"This is a carrying case, plain and simple.As you may see, there aren't pictures of the case open. This is because the top just hang open when the DS is in use. There's NO other way. It's very difficult to play using this case. Spend your money on something else."
1,Boring,"How can a game about pulverizing thugs be boring? Somehow Manhunt mangages it. Here's the game...you walk and walk and walk somemore...see a guy...punch or slash a million times then walk another digital mile. Ohhh, can you feel the excitement?Ok, I do have to admit the garbage bag as a weapon was pretty cool the first time but it got old really fast."
4,I wanted to LOVE it....,"This is truly one of those games where looks can be deceiving. It is quite violent, but the violence is always a cut scene. There are 3 levels of stealth kills. Each levels kill for a single weapon is always teh same, so it gets a bit repetitive. The only things i HATED were that it's ALL stealth and if you actually have to engage in melee combat with an enemy it takes them forever to go down. Truly an inspiring game though..I am thinkign about renting it again to see if i can get further and enjoy it more."
4,Mind numbingly brutal,"This game is BRUTAL that's all I can say,its gritty, disturbing and just something you should play if your up to the challenge as the game can get hard especially the later parts where the action is full on shooter. This game is all about the hunted vs the hunter, in every level you'll be the man being hunted by menacing, racist, vile criminals who are out to get you, you have to hide in shadows and pick them off one by one. The means of executing them are quite nasty and sickening but after playing for an hour you'll be on the edge trying to survive. And by the end of the game you'll be numb to all the violence like you've seen every single way a human being can be murdered. I recommend this game to anyone who is ok with the subject matter."
4,The smell of death is in the air,"Just the feeling of killing a man with a glass shard will get you heart pumping and in this game it will pump a lot. The gameplay itself has a pretty basic scenario to it hide and when the guys back is turned kill him, but it's just the sheer brutality of it that never gets old."
4,decent,"Whoa! i wasnt expecting a game like this, IT BLEW ME AWAY! first off, id like to say, if your disturbed easily DO NOT play this game! you will be sick, and run for the bathroom in mere seconds! second off, id like to say that if you like really gory intense game that has buckets of blood, weapons, and massive swear use, YOULL LOVE THIS GAME! the plot is that youre james earl ca$h, and mass murderers are hunting you for sport (or for fun) and you must kill them before they kill you. sick huh? oh ya! but the main point is that this game is action, but its also puzzle, sneak up on them before they sneak up on you with knifes, butcher knifes, ice pix, and/or guns, ETC. you are being guided to the person that did this to you...and butcher him... ya i know it sounds creepy, BUT ITS REALLY FUN! a definite 5"
3,Hard to believe its not fiction!!!,An interesting 'different view' of Tibet. The book is well written in a narative style that captured the interest of the reader. This book reads like any number of occult thrillers of the 20s and 30s and it is hard to believe that it is an accurate portrail of Tibet. This book however seems to have an agenda or bias in furthering the particular religious ideas of the author. All in all well worth the read.
5,Mysterious and thought provoking,"After reading about this book on various different sites, I thought that I would get a copy and have at it. And I am glad that I did.This is the type of book, that for me is hard to put down. It carries within it's covers, mystery, intrigue, magic, and I think a lot of truth. It seems to show what is really going on behind some of the religious sects there are proliferating now in the world.Illion demonstrates that just because a group may seem to be aligned with the 'light', it is not always the case as one delves deeper into the hierarchy that ultimately runs the show. Joining blindly with a group without first learning all that there is to learn about them, can literally lead you down a path to oblivion.This book has a lot to offer to those who have an open mind."
5,Incredibly interesting,"Wow.. I will never get to go to Tibet.. yet after reading this incredible book, I feel as if I had been there.Fascinating and interesting.Often seems like Fantasia.. yet very well documented, so I guess.. it's all true. Amazing. A must read.. for a well-rounded education.It is more than a good read.. it expands your horizon in many ways..I could not put the book down.. til I turned the last page."
5,Adventurous,"This unusual true story chronicles the journey of a Seeker, and it seems that interesting things happen when one embarks on a compelling spiritual quest for the unknown. With an attitude of openness and humility, it seems that the Universe has met our traveler with serendipitous and totally unexpected meetings and experiences. From the humble and humorous, to the outright dangerous, to a meeting with what one could only call one of the darkest and most powerful beings on the planet. But all providing exactly the opportunities needed to grow toward his spiritual ideal. A must-read for those interested in unusual knowledge and true experiences."
3,a quality made duvet cover,"I like everything about this duvet cover except the color. I thought it would be a pale lavender by the picture but it actually is quite a bright pink. Not really the color I wanted. Other than that, it has held up very well and looks very nice."
2,Description raised false hopes,It shows too much asphalt and not enough of the surrounding countryside. I'd hoped that it might give nature sounds.
1,Deceptive,"Aloe Vera - Potted Plant in Terra Cotta PlanterIt seems that this a simple storefront that delegates it's orders to companies that are not able to meet its promises. The item was shipped from CA, where they can't legally ship potted plants. Late ship, USPS, every other item sent USPS came in days, this took nearly 2 weeks. Not as described, Offered in terra cotta planter, received in bare roots, frozen roots, Packed with paper bags as packaging. Broken plant, Very rude when problems arroze. No return, guarantee or compromise offered. Nothing about bare roots - Specifically stated as ""Potted Plant in Terra Cotta Planter"". Nothing was mentioned about bare roots and still no pot to put the plants in. Not as adertised and completely deceptive. From the main co. or a distributor."
3,"Starts off a little predictable, gets better toward the end","I found this romance novel to be average to slightly above average among easy summer or vacation reads. I mostly read for stress reduction and my chosen genre is romance. I've read better, I've read worse--but if you are seeking a quick read with all the standard romance elements, including a couple of decent, not excellent, but decent love scenes, this book may be for you--especially if your taste runs toward the whole ""royality and the virgin bride"" thing. If so, this one is sure to please. I frankly found the emphasis on the whole virgin bride experience and pressure to produce an heir, while secretly downing birth control pills a bit predictable and overdone--but again, this is not my prefered romance setting. All in all, for 3 bucks and about 3-4 hrs of my life, I was satisfied with it."
5,Simply awesome,"I researched this book and a few others like it before purchasing the Norton Facsimile. Bear in mind that I am not a Shakespeare scholar and cannot speak to details that an expert may notice; I had to educate myself about how a facsimileis different from a textbook, the contents, the purpose, the compilation, editing, and last but not least, the cost. From this lay person's point of view, the Norton Facisimile hit high marks on all points. I bought this book as a gift; judging from therecipent's delight, I made the right choice (he didn't ask specifically for the book). The First Folio is a sumptious volume and will become a dearly loved permanent part of their library. The cost is reasonable and well worth the expense."
2,Broke it.,"I guess it would be the tongue of tongue and groove that broke off. Used it 3 or 4 times. I was pulling on it with all my might but was still surprised that I could break it like that. The tongue where it attaches to the body was surprisingly thin I thought. If you need a heavy duty plier as would most people who would buy something this big, I would go for a better brand like channel lock."
2,Kaizen for the Shopfloor,"An abbreviated version of the REAL Kaizen book; Kaizen Event Implementation Manual. OK for a quick read, copies much of what's in the Kaizen Event Implementation Manual.Something as important as doing and understanding Kaizen deserves the real thing, not this. Save your money."
1,Rip-off,I received a print out of a random book inside the Keizen cover book. The actual content of the Keizen was not there. It was just a prin out of something else....
5,"Where have you gone, Erich Wolfgang Korngold?","I LOVE KORNGOLD!!! Where have the likes of his kind gone in today's film world? (To the bank, I guess.) BUT I NEED TRACK LISTINGS/SAMPLES FOR THIS CD! How is anyone supposed to know what Korngold gems Newman collates?! I DON'T WANT TO MISS OUT on Korngold's masterpiece ""Kings Row"", or his underrated and darkly profound ""The Sea Wolf""!"
2,A disappointment--slick packaging for lousy performances.,"Well, too bad. I LOVE Korngold, and was looking forward to this CD. But it doesn't live up to the GOLD CD hype. The violins are shrill, and can't seem to get out of the way of their own vibrati to play in unison. Certainly Newman should have got them working off the same cam shaft. I think you're much better off with, for instance, the CD of The Sea Hawk with Charles Gerhardt conducting the National Philharmonic Orchestra.The one saving grace to these performances is the superior horn section. Nothing lacking there.For contrast to this gold CD, try listening to the opening titles of rented videocassettes--for instance Korngold's own recording of King's Row is vastly superior to this rendition.The liner notes for this CD make a big deal about the quality of the recording. But it's flat and thin. Just saying it's great doesn't make it so."
3,Train switch causing issues,this worked on the manual Lego Maersk Train but when we tried to get the motorized Lego Cargo Train to work the train keeps comming off the track when it passes the switch. Ok but we removed it so the motorized train works better.
3,"Great, but.......","It's very cool to be able to switch tracks but without the other track pack, you can't make these and the tracks that come with the trains connect."
3,love it or hate it,"A military family of six escalates beyond ""dysfunction"" once the daughter (Akkemay), roughly sixteen, learns that mom has had an affair with her boyfriend, the girl employing her eldest brother (Frank Schaafsma), a year or so younger, to off mommy. When the attempt fails, an all out war begins between the parents and kids. What starts out as a comedy, comparable to something like Meatballs or Porky's, becomes strictly a dark comedy by midway, slips into the status of horror by its end. Bashed by most critics but a general crowd pleaser. Pepijin and Olivier Somer, approximately seven and four, star as the two littlest brothers. There is a peculiar musical scene included. You will probably either love or hate this one."
2,A children's movie not to be seen by children.,"This is the ""English version"" of the Dutch movie ""Schatjes!"". Translation: it is dubbed in (American) English, so don't look at the actors' faces as they speak if you know who is speaking.The story reminds me of the American movie ""Home Alone"", except in this movie four children are acting against their parents, which escalates enormously. The children win it in a very unlikely and unsatisfactory way.I would rather watch this one, like any foreign movie, in the original language with subtitles."
4,"Not bad, not superb.","I'll be honest, I bought this book at a garage sale (read ""at a discount""), and it was totally worth it. It's full of awesome examples of how to apply some pretty heavy concepts. However, the code examples frequently won't compile, and are replete with errors."
2,Not so bad,"Not for beginners.Code not easy to understand.If you are at the start point of your studies of AI, you should read other books before this."
2,Passable Fiction,"I did not feel that this tale was one of Heather Graham's best. I felt that it contained too much background and historical information. I found myself skipping over parts of the detail to get to the ""meat"" of the story. All in all, it is passable fiction, even if it is a little slow."
3,Night of the Blackbird,"I finished reading the book, but I was not that impressed with this one. The plot and the characters were not that interesting. I have read 5 of her books so far, and I loved the other 4."
3,too much detail,"It's nice when romance authors do research, but sometimes I'm left with the feeling that they think that they must use it all in a single book. That happens here. Great characters, good plot, then - we keep getting sermons and history lessons. I agree with the author's views on the Irish situation, but I was looking for entertainment, not a seminar."
1,Save Yourself the Trouble!,"Although the introduction was quite promising, the rest of the book left much to be desired, like an interesting plot, developed characters, and other trivial matters.This book reads like a dumbed-down mystery (think ""Mystery for Romance Fans 101""), and the plot crawls along oh-so-painfully. The first half is spent detailing just HOW Irish the Kelly family is: multiple renditions of the song ""Danny Boy,"" the truth and the fairy tale of St. Patrick, Irish politics, leprechauns, banshees, fairies, etc. In fact, everyone would be content to be coated in green paint, except for the heroine, who cannot let a day go by, without insisting that she's American and not Irish. No insight is given as to WHY she feels the need to make such a distinction, although an embarrassing childhood episode might have helped to give the character SOME dimension.Save yourself the trouble and pick up one of her historical romances. Mystery is NOT where this author's talents lie."
5,Night of The Blackbird,"Found it a very interesting book, wasn't sure at first but as I read on I found it most compelling. I am never certain I am going to enjoy present day causes but Heather Graham knows how to keep her readers in suspense"
2,Outdated and unclear,"I've only read the first six chapters of this book and I am already frustrated with it. It was first published in 1971 and in the chapters I've completed so far, it does not appear that the reference information was updated in the 1983 edition. They still refer to population statistics from the 1966 Australian Census as a viable purview of Maori religious distribution. In addition,I am disappointed as the chapters provide virtually no framework for time periods, religion origins, establishment of the Gods and adaptions through the religion life spans. In addition, they do not coherently link the religious practices with the Gods and their evolution and modification from evolving populations. If you are hoping to get a basic understanding of the religions discussed book without reading other world religion books, you will be disappointed. My advice is not to waste your money."
5,world religions,I love learning about other religions and I think everyone should know about other religions so that way they wont be as judgemental about them and this book gives really useful information about them.
5,Poetry to savor,"Nancy Williams' poetry makes every word count and sticks in your mind long after you've read it, just what poetry should do. I find it most enjoyable to read these slowly, in order to savor each poem.Rose Norman"
1,"If you are an artist, don't bother","If you are an artist don't bother. I thought this was a great idea, and maybe in a year or so it will be. However, on the two Indie Arts DVD's I reviewed. There is lots of talk and little action. I was very disappointed from a visual standpoint."
5,We're the Beer Nuts and You Suck....,"I've been going to see the Beer Nuts for 4+ years, and I never bought the damn disc. I finally bought it. The CD can't replace seeing them live, but it is a quick fix when you need to get them out of your system. Check 'em out a Double Door St. Pat's show and they will become your favorite band. If you leave dry, you should go back to listening to the Cure."
4,Excellent source material,"This book portrays an excellent view of the life of Henry VIII as well as those that influenced him and the way that he managed his court as King. Although an old volume, it provides excellent material and a few arguments that both justify and condemn his actions as he seperated from the Catholic Church and established the Angelican church.I would say that this volume provides a balanced view of this king. There is ample additional information often not found in biographies, such as costs of the management of a royal household.Excellent read."
2,Doesn't look like what I ordered,"The item I ordered was a Menorah that looked more natural, the branches were random. The one I received is straight and traditional looking. I am not happy."
1,Flimsy and more like plastic than a Composite,"This is made for a youth portable unit held down by sandbags. The backboard is made of flimsy plastic that easily gives when impacted by a ball. If for child's use, you'll likely be satisfied although the components are cheap. The net is made of poor quality string and the rim fits sloppily within the spring-loaded break-away bracket.This is not for an adult court and it should have been better described."
4,Disaster DVD,"I Love this DVD The Video is much clearer and better than I expected, as no restoration has taken place. The colors are vibrant and deep. The audio is clear and in full surround.The movie it's self is of coures the grandfather of all disaster films. And the best I might add.Now all we need is the other disaster films from ther 70's, and 80's to be placed on DVD!(Full Screen Version)"
5,Rusty ROCKS!,"Rusty's solo album rocks just as hard as he does and anyone who authors the lyrics ""kiss your own a$$ if nobody else will"" deserves a listen! He has an all-star support team including Paul McCartney and his current touring band. They all perform on the first track Hurt Myself which has a Beatles-type flavor. My favorite is Sentimental Chaos - great syncopation on the refrain and Rusty opens up on the guitar solo. Electric Trains is another fave - such a variety of sounds really build a train atmosphere with a sentimental message that is definitely not sappy - extremely well done. Catbox Beach is an instrumental with a California surf-type sound which makes sense since that is where Rusty learned his craft. For a variety of sounds and styles and to support this talented musician, give Rusty a listen!"
4,Unnecessary shipping costs...couldn't they have been mailed together?,I ordered four rings at the same time and each was sent out separately. I believe shipping was charged each time.The rings were shipped in a padded envelope and shipping totaled $21.95. For the four rings which totaled$ 7.72 I felt this was unnecessary and a little much. But they are here and I don't have to look for them anymore.
3,top of the heap,"saw this in movies years ago,can't find it on dvd and may have copy on vhs very good movie from what i can remember a different kind of black film at that time ,thought provoking."
3,"Thin, ok for summer","These sheets are really thin, to the point that you can almost see through the navy blue one. However, that works well for us in the summer. I like that they have elastic pockets on the bottom, so they usually stay on the mattress, while being flat on the sides and top so the kids can still have a sheet over them on warm nights. They do get pilled when washed, especially with other items. If you was them with a blanket, expect pills. Overall, I like them just enough, but I have looked elsewhere for sturdier sheets for fall/winter. (Yes, they can be found, usually at a store with a bullseye.)"
4,"Fibonacci ,selected chart patterns and candlesticks.","This book is a combination of Candlestick, Fibonacci and some basic chart patterns, Three quarters of the books discussed the basic principles and applications of these three tools, only the last chapter show you how to apply these tools together. The explanation of candlestick and chart pattern seem to be too brief, and the fibonacci part overlays a lot with the author's previous book. I would suggest you to buy this author's previous book ""The New Fibonacci trader"" together with Steve Nison's ""Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques¡, and it would be sufficient for you."
4,Great companion to have on hand,"My teenage son is currently studying Chaucer for his English literature class and is having a blast learning the Middle English and even older English phrases used in Chaucer's original writings. I am impressed because he usually hates literature, so aces to Davis for creating such a great motivating helpmate. (I have been using it, too, and it makes the translations easy and comprehension much better - wish I had had this when I was in high school),"
1,Very Bad,"First iam not completely knocking data pilot products, in fact i may try them again. my phone was on the chart lgvx8100 but the software would not recognize it at first the website would mot accept the serial number, after i email them and i recieved no response. i return to the website and all of a sudden it accepted the number. then the sofware problems persisted. maybe i had the wrong version but my phone was in the book. maybe i will try again another version, maybe, BUYER BEWARE....."
1,Flashback to Windows 95,This software promised a lot but did not deliver a single one of the promised features. I spent over 10 hours trying to get this thing to work. I contacted tech support through their online support site feature. I received a fast response which crytically guided me as to how to install the proper driver for the usb cable for my phone. The computer now recognizes that a Susteen cable has been plugged in with a phone attached but will not do anything with it. Launching the software causes an endless string of error messages about stuff not installed or loaded properly although I did reinstall it and repair the installation several times. Tech support is now unresponsive and telephone support has NO 800 number. It is only open 8 AM to 5 PM Pacific time on weekdays when the rest of the world works for a living. This whole experience reminds me of 10 years ago when installing software with Windows 95.
1,A waste of money and time!,"The Pix n' Tunes can deliver neither! The phone-end connector is poorly designed and looses connection easily if moved slightly.The software goes through endless installations of drivers and still does not ""find"" the phone (Verizon LG-VX5300), or rather it will at times identify the phone but then refuse to communicate with it.I would expect better from a piece of shareware.You would think that with so many camera phones out there that somebody would have a workable transfer solution?"
1,not to happy,"I suppose if your phone is supported by this product it would be fine. I can't really say because my phone didn't work with it. Although I was under the impression that it was supposed to. After it didn't work, I went directly to their website and downloaded the version that was supposed to work with my phone and so far it hasn't worked either. I can't even get the program to launch. I've tried to email them about the problem and haven't recieved anything helpful. The one message they sent to me didn't help. I haven't had a chance to call the service phone number yet due to lack of time, but that is my next step.If you buy it make double sure that your phone is supported first. Otherwise it is a waste of time and money."
1,Appears to not work with Windows 7:,"I just bought this used on amazon,It apparently installed fine on my Windows 7,But whenever i try to run it, nothing happens.I tried running it on my windows XP pro, the program opens up,but when i try to update it, it says that there is no internet connection (when obviously there is) i even tried disabling the firewall,And my phone is newer, so i wont be able to use it on Pix n tunes without updating.even though the phone is under the supported list on the data-pilot website.Hopefully i will be able to update it sooner or later."
1,Poor performance,"I bought the data cable, and then downloaded the software from their site. First of all, the photo downloading software doesn't work. It starts to download, then fails and tells me to reboot my phone. It does this over and over. The only reason I bought the product was to download photos, which it will not do. Second of all, AFTER you buy the software they tell you that they will charge you $9.99 to return it - even the downloaded version. I am going to return the cable and dispute the charge on the software, because it's a defective product that doesn't work."
2,Somewhat disapointed,Does not cut cleanly unless you attack a branch or stalk as near 90 degree angle. For the cost it is much inferior to my Fiskers Trimmer.
1,Bad plug,"The portability of these speakers is wonderful. HOWEVER, the plug clearly has a loose connection because I have to tape the plug to the power cord at a weird angle and then hope there isn't a breeze coming through the window to dislodge it. If you care about music quality and product durability, well, don't buy a $20 pair of speakers."
2,A Big Disappointment!,"Being an artist myself, I think Ms. Flores could have done a much better job with this video. The craft is poor and the language is geared towards very early elementary aged children. I should have taken the time to read the editorial review that lists the description of the content. I was looking for an informative DVD geared toward middle school students, and the content and length of this video was not worth the $29.95. There is much more involved in printmaking techniques and even basic history of the art form that students would would enjoy and benefit from."
3,Our Gang on DVD,"This is probably the best DVD to buy if you want a sampler of Our Gang/Little Rascals video. Picture clarity is very good, much better than I ever expected for films this old. Sound has often been a problem, but its again better than usual. This DVD release consists of two discs. One contains some of the more classic episodes such as ""Kid From Borneo"".The second disc contains some rare footage such as a reunion of the original cast on the TV show ""You Asked For It"", and an advertisement for a bicycle with Spanky as the star. Much of this rare footage I had never seen before.My only complaint is the length. There could have been at least another hours worth of footage put on both discs. I got the feeling I was paying DVD prices for a VHS tape"
2,did help,the book did not help my research on how to write erotic fiction. I should have read reviews about this book first.
3,A Guide on writing Erotica Fiction,"This book is more for writing erotica rather than erotica romance. I am sorry to say, I really didn't find anything helpful in it for writing romance love scenes. I am sure it would be helpful for writing straight erotica."
4,great elementary reference,"this is a great first book on introductory functional data analysis. the strength of the book lies in the fact that it introduces all concepts intuitively at first, without overwhelming the reader with any formalities. for the more mathematically minded reader, this a good introduction to the subject, which can be later complemented with more formal textbooks on functional analysis."
3,Original yet didnt quite deliver,There were alot of unique thoughts portrayed in this movie I would give alot of credit to the film crew and whoever directed the ideas for the filming i guess my turn off with this movie was the pulling teeth process of the 2nd half of the movie there werent any fillers just long unnessary scenes that draged on its worth renting and watching again a few years later on cable tv but not worth adding to your collection just my opion though.
4,Awesome fight scenes AND Melanie Thierry,The fight choreography is that of the Bourne Films so hearing that I decided to take a chance. The story takes place in the future and a Cop pursues those responsible for killing his Wife. The fight scenes are excellent and the acting was very good. ALL in all worth your time. Keep in mind this film is in French! Would hate you to order it and then find out.
1,"This is plain old Racism, avoid at all costs.","I can't believe they still publish this stuff in the twenty first century, it's like finding some racist relic from the 40s or 50s. Blackface is no different from this.Blatantly depicting feather wearing native americans with the word SAVAGE emblazoned across the title is just plain old racism. This is a terrible series from an awful and obtuse author. It's like the bit from Blazing Saddles: ""where the white women at""... but not a joke.This is belittling to entire cultures of native peoples, for nothing more than the base edification of the predominantly white female readership. Anyone with a shred of self reflection should be shrinking away from the radiant white guilt emanating from this tripe like a vampire from sunlight."
2,The Savage 'was actually a savage to his low self-esteem',"The above statement says it all. The Savage suffered from a low self esteem due to his mixed blood. Where was the strong, confident, and sometimes arrogant hero? Definitely not found in the 'Savage'. O.k., call me sick, but when reading romances, I enjoy men whom are strong and confident; not constantly berating himself because he's mixture of two wonderful ethinic cultural groups. And yes, I'm a historian and undrestand why he would feel that way during the particular time in history, however, most other romantic heros' would portray the 'I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't', so enjoy and be damned' attitude."
3,a suprising choice,"I got this cd because it was on sale, and was suprised to find that it was not really all that bad. You are sure to enjoy some of the tracks more than others, depending on how much you enjoy classic aternative rock. Their sound is nothing new, however they do their style well. I wouldn't recommend this cd unless you love plain alterative rock."
2,Haphazard lo-fi pop,"The Minus 5 is a side project of singer-songwriter Scott McCaughey of Young Fresh Fellows, aided by R.E.M.'s Peter Buck and the Posies' two key members. The four, plus a few friends, clearly had a blast compiling the record, trading off unfamiliar instruments and playfully adding a cavalcade of sounds to McCaughey's ""Automatic for the People""-flavored acoustic tunes. The quirky, usually irrelevant, contributions become a problem as, in nearly every song, a wayward piano (""Vulture"") or electric guitar (""Find a Finger"") or bass (""Algerian Hook"") loudly intrudes on the pretty strumming and melody. Each listener will have to decide for himself whether the interjections are delightfully inventive or fatally annoying. Either way, the songs aren't all that strong, and the musical-chairs musicianship means that no great performances shine through. Don't buy ""Old Liquidator"" expecting anything at the level of the Posies or R.E.M. But sometimes low-impact fun is just what the DJ ordered."
5,Get in touch with our ancestors,"I recommend this book to anyone wanting to better understand our ancestors, not as unearthed fossils, but as living creatures who roamed the earth. Kingdon uses his own illustrations to bring us face-to-face with these ancient creatures, and to show just how we arrived on the scene. I am a scientist, but not an anthropologist, and have to admit that I needed to read the book twice to really understand it. Kingdon does not hand the reader easy answers, and does not provide summaries -- but rather proposes scenarios and dynamics that played out over several million years. This book is a delight, but it requires patience and/or some rereading."
3,Just Okay,"This case was nice and offered some protection, but if you drop your phone, which I do at times, it pops right off."
3,halloween 2 good halloween 3 alright,halloween 2 is an 80s classic its got all the cliches but with good atmosphere. not as good as the original but good. part three had nothing to do with part one and part two but still is alright i am a fan of the halloween series and if youre a halloween fan you will really enjoy this halloween 2 is the best sequel halloween three is the worst sequel but still is alright i wish there would be specail feutures but the movies halloween 2 which is good and halloween 3 which is alright combined is decent even with no specail feutures.
4,Great Deal!,"I own every movie in the Halloween series, including the Rob Zombie remake and the Halloween: 25 Years of Terror documentary. I loved this two pack because it was cheap and gave you Halloween 3 basically for free, because it isn't worth spending money on (the movie sucked!). Anyway, this is a great deal for anyone looking for Halloween 2 and it gives you ca chance to try out Halloween 3 without wasting your money."
3,OK set.,It is an Ok set. Not great but it will do without spending a lot on the product. I will not rate the movies as others have done that. I actually liked the concept of Halloween III. It could be more polished but the story line is pretty good entertainment.
3,"Halloween 2 good, 3 sucks","Halloween 2 explains a lot for you and is all in all a very good movie. On the other hand, halloween 3 in my opinion was a waste of the halloween name. It had nothing to do with Michael Myers and just a sucky movie. But if you are like me, and you can't have some movies without all in a series, then it is well worth the money."
3,3 for part 2/ZILCH for the godawfull part 3,is it any wonder the studios are giving part 3 the piggyback treatment?those responsible for the mistake that is part 3 had to have known this was doomed.many other reviewers were right by saying this garbage should have been a completely separate piece of junk unto itself.immediately after part 3 the franchise as a whole went head first into toilet bowl.i can only shake my head in utter disbelief that john carpenter would destroy such an almost unmuckupable franchise.has he done anything were a darn since?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
3,Good Movie,Good Movie for the Halloween Season you get two movie for the price of one and you can be scared for a whole afternoon highly recommend if you are in to the Halloweem Movies
3,For Big Fans Only,"DCC remastering engineer Steve Hoffman has done a nice job with this mono recording from 1957, making it sound fresh and alive, and adding a bonus track that was not included in the original Riverside LP release. Fans of Sonny Rollins (sorry, I am not one of them) will definitely want to pick this gold disk up. Less rabid fans would better be served by a less expensive version."
3,3 1/2 Stars -- Holds Your Interest But Easily Forgettable!,"Black Water Transit is like many thrillers -- interesting enough to finish but forgettable right after finishing them. Stroud's plot is interesting but not particularly memorable, and the same applies to his characters. While Black Water Transit is entertaining, I couldn't develop a strong sense of caring about what was to happen and to whom it was to happen. As a result, I often found myself checking to see how many pages I had left so that I could move on to my next book. Overall, I wouldn't recommend that you rush out to read Black Water Transit. On the other hand, I don't think you'll be disappointed if you do decide to read it. For me, reading Black Water Transit was like chewing a piece of gum --the taste while chewing it is familiar and enjoyable, but because the taste is similar to most other pieces I've chewed, it becomes forgettable soon after experiencing it."
2,Disappointing,"Hard to believe that Stroud is the author of the nicely paced and beautifully written ""Lizardskin."" With ""Blackwater Transit,"" Stroud seems to be relying as much on a quirky writing style as much as he is on plotting - so much so that his storytelling gets in the way of his storytelling. Call this a novel with an excess of style. Too bad."
5,Couldn't put it down,"The writing was so crisp, and the descriptions of people, places and events were so sharp, that I stopped and re-read some passages just for the pleasure of soaking in the prose. This is one of those books that hums; it moves along and you get sucked right in to the story and you just have to keep reading!No spoilers here. I won't give away any of the storyline. But trust me when I say you will be enthralled wih this book."
5,Moffatts Rock!,"Okay if you buy one cd or love one group this is the group. This cd rocks, both vesions rock, teh Tour Souvenir Package rocks, and all singles and non-released songs. Big time fan telling you buy this cd or any of their cd's. But you gotta see them in concert to see what they are all about, so go to one. Off the subject! Get the cd and go to their official site get on the MB! MOFFATTS ROCK! S<C><B>D rock!Mandy"
3,Good Only If You Are A Completist,"Although these figures are great you would really only want them if you already have the Apu and Manjula figures because other than that, they really won't be that much fun but they do display well."
3,Camera slow to aquire image,"I installed this system on a Yukon SUV for the purpose of aligning my trailer hitch with the ball on the SUV. For this purpose, it serves the purpose for which it was purchased. Several problems have been observed. 1)It talkes about 30 seconds to achieve an image after the power is applied to the camera that is connected to the back-up light. 2) The power-off on the display does not always work...it is often necessary to remove the power connector to turn it off. 3) The image is often up-side down on power-up until the power is removed and re-connected. The button to rotate the image does not always wrok until the power is reset. 4)The image flickers off every few seconds when the rear hatch is closed."
3,This can be had for much cheaper,"FYI, I just saw this at my local BJ's warehouse store for eighty nine bucks, can't comment on the product itself, other than that it operates in the 2.4 Ghz range. The 2.4 range is shared by many other household items (Microwaves, Cordless phones, baby monitors, wireless routers, etc) which could explain the image interference others have seen."
1,useless buy,The product description does not say that the camera has to be wired to the car's rear lighting system. It makes more sense to buy a camera for $50 more if it is battery operated. The installation is not as easy as 123.
5,Das Lopper ist wunderbar!,"This lopper is designed to cut tree branches that might be very difficult with ordinary anvil or bypass loppers. It succeeds wildly. It is relatively light and easy to handle. As a retired machinist, I can attest to how well it is engineered and the overall quality. My brother has had one of these for years and it still cuts like new. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a light, durable lopper that reduces cutting force."
5,The desserts are fantastic!,"I've never had a bad experience with theserecipes. Too bad this book is no longer inprint, I have people ask me for it all thetime."
2,Freestyle Salsa,"This DVD only covers freestyle salsa moves. That is fine if you want to dance separately. If you want to dance ""salsa"" then go with another DVD."
4,I SERVED IN THE ARMY WITH DAHMER,THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN PRETTY WELL SEE PAGE 77BILLY CAPHAW IS A VERY GOOD FRIEND WHO ALSO SERVED LOOK FOR A BOOK AT SOME POINT FROM BOTH OF US.
5,Gripping Read,"Brain masters seems to start where most author forget, before they killers were born and how the parents relationships develope. The author has done a lot of research into jeffry dalmers life before he turned the into lonley psycotic killer that america most feared. The fact that the author gives the eerie detailed account of what happened to the unfortunate individals who were at jeffrey dahmers mercy. when reading the book, Brian Masters takes into the victims familes and freinds and how he was able to keep the murders hidden from the police for so long. All in all this book is a must any for seriel killer reader"
2,"Cheaply made, should have read the description better","I got this before my son's first birthday and am not impressed at all. Maybe I had too high of expectations. It's really cheaply made slightly thicker than cardboard. It hangs by a little ribbon. My son is 18 months and kept ripping it off of the wall. We just took it down, folded it up and put in in the closet. The chart is so dark that you can't see any writing that gives his height. Don't like it."
4,Great Gift for Boys,"I bought this as a gift, so I can't attest to the actual chart as it was enclosed. It was packaged nicely and looks like a great product.I read the other reviews about writing not showing up on the dark paper, but I don't see how that would be a problem if you would just use a metallic marker, like a silver one for example.Great gift!"
5,Fun game for kids of all ages....,I bought this game for my son and he really enjoing now. Exvellent game for kids.
3,Simple Game,"This game would best benefit children from maybe 5 to 8 years old. The game is very simple and involves picking what you want to drive and guiding it through the same track over and over. There are oil slicks and car crushers that can slow your racer but not much else to entertain you. I would probably say this is about one step above Pole Position, the old one."
2,"starts well, ends ridiculously!","This film starts as if it's capable of delivering a good balance of credible artistic/dramatic value. As it progresses towards its inevitable ""This is going to end in tears"" conclusion, the director seems to run out of art and resort to other means!"
1,ESTUPIDO,"This is by far the worst movie I have ever suffered through. I watched it for extra credit in my Spanish class and thought ""SCUBA, evil babysitter and spoiled kids, sounds interesting."" Well it was anything but interesting. Don't watch it. Please, I wasted 2 hours of my life and do not want you to also."
5,A must have for all Hip Hop lovers!,"This book is one of a kind. My friend put me on with the book. When I first got it, I thought is was over priced, but after I opened the book, I was amazed with the package. After the 22nd page, I was convinced the book was unique and a must buy if you're a true hip hop lover. It's worth every penny. The book brings out another side to many hip hop artists that we don't see on T.V., plus it makes you reminisce on the old school artists as well.""Everything is Hip Hop"""
3,A worthy reference book for developers already working with shaders,"This makes a good companion reference to the DirectX SDK. The HLSL Intrinsic Function Reference included as an appendix is especially good, citing the supported shader versions and performance considerations for each entry.If you're just getting started with Direct3D or shaders, then this is probably not the right book for you (instead, check out ""Shaders for Game Programmers and Artists"" by the same author). Although this book does cover some bare-bones and basic shaders, it's probably better to use this book if you are looking for reference information not found in the SDK.Also note that this book is based on the Summer 2004 DirectX SDK. The best parts of the book are still absolutely current, but it would be wise to keep a copy of the latest SDK docs handy just in case."
2,Informative but not capitvating,"The product contains a lot of contents as a whole and they are very informtive. However, it is the way the contents are presented which make it a drag to watch for me.If one is expecting this product to be a movie-like documentary in the league of Wild Africa BBC, Planet Earth BBC or National Geographic Amazing Planet, one could be disappointed."
3,Moving around standards,"3 1/2While short of the melodic heft Evans would imbue on his future playing, this is still one of the better early post-bop trio piano recordings to move the sub-genre forward."
5,Beautiful,"It is difficult to overstate the quality of Bill Evans playing. I have been listening seriously to jazz for over 30 years and I do not believe there is a more consistent artist than Bill Evans. The quality of his work is astonishing, session after session, especially the recordings he did for Riverside. Explorations is deep, swinging and melodic, as are so many of his dates. This session is of particularly high quality, and the version of Nardis is just wonderful. This guy has the ability to play unique versions of every tune he approaches -- his ability to project the inner essence of a song is unmatched. Every cut on this session is great, as the trio is in fine form."
2,Not As Good As Some of the Others,"I enjoy Emily Brightwell, but I didn't like this book as much as many of her other books. Maybe it had to do with the ""weedy lots"" or maybe it was just the guest characters she created for this story alone. At any rate, it was an OK read, but not one of my favorites."
4,Best one ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have been waiting for this game for months, and when it came out I immediately bought it.I tell you its the best, most addictive game Ive played for a while.Anyone who is considering buying this, stop considering, buy it now!!!!!!!!!!The characters are soo much cooler than taiketsu,(that game sucked)The graphics are awsome, just buy this I swear you won't regret it.P.S.trunks, gohan, and vegeta are the best and coolest characters."
3,"it's ok I guess, maybe, not quite sure....","honestly, I dont like it. the story mode is boring and inaccurate on free battle modeyou have to fight in teams, no one on one, and when you can fight like that, you have to fight every character. the hp system hardly makes sense, and it has depth thing which is NOT fun because it takes a long time to get back to the normal screen.the only reason I gave this as much as 3 stars is because it has Gotenks, who is my favorite dbz character. this game isnt so fun. GOTENKS RULES!!!!!!!! YEAH GOTENKS!!!!"
2,Fatal Justice,The story line was slow. It didn't keep my interest. I think more should have been focus on the two main characters and why their feelings for each other remained.
3,i don't know what it is like because i haven't heard it.,I would like to hear it properly i'm just doing this for fun i don't really know what it is like bye.
3,Love Dice,"This is a fun little item to put in a gift basket for your spouse or for newlyweds.A little pricey for the materials not to mention that if you buy themaround Valentines day you can get them for around a buck or two at Walgreens.Still a fun item, that brought laughter to a romantic weekend."
3,"Kinda Campy, but not that bad",I too saw this movie on T.V. when I was a kid and I too loved that Bruce Lee is the hero. I find that things we loved as kids look different as adults. I still loved this movie even though the quality was clearly taken from a worn tape. I would recommend this to anyone who loves those old badly dubbed Kung-Fu movies.
3,Ave Maria...! Animated Bruce Lee!!!!,"This will be one of the shortest & sweetest reviews I've ever given a martial arts flick. My copy of Chinese Gods arrived yesterday and upon cramming it into my dvd player as soon as I could through the wrapping I quickly drew the following conclusions: 1)I could be wrong, but this appears to be a movie cenetered around Chinese mythology, or mythological gods, 2)Be warned...the animation is sub-par, so if you're looking for anime you may want to pass this one up, and 3)This one's a keeper for the fact that it's the only film that features an animated Bruce Lee character.And that's all Decatur Redd wrote,folks. An easy one to pass up if you're looking for anime, but a collector's item for die hard Bruce Lee fans who want to have the only animated Bruce Lee feature in their possessions."
3,BLUE HEART,"I bought the corelle blue heart counter mats to go with matching stovetop cover. Even though these have a card board bottom and can't be emersed in water, they serve there purpose and can easily be wiped down. If you like this design there are so many great matching items, from dishes and glasses to cookware and napkins. Used these forever until just recently when I switched to a coffee theme."
4,"Nice to have around :) still a bit ""girlie"" for me","Only need to use once in awhile.Don't have a nice table, but once in awhile it's good to put down hot stuff on."
4,Good Movie,"I bought this for my daughter who was getting into surfing - even though we don't live anywhere near the ocean. Both she and I enjoyed it. It was a softer approach to surfing than some of the male dominated high energy movies. I think ROXY, quicksilver and the other surf companies could do a better job catering to young women interested in the sport as well as fashion. But that is just my opinion. My favorite movies are still the Bruce Brown Endless Summer series and his son's Step Into Liquid movie."
2,Tedious,This video is tedious in the way that it is slow moving-even for ninety minutes! Also the accents are quite bad and incomprehensible unless you either have the actual script in front of you or close captions. Save your money and do not buy this. You have better things to do with your money and day!
5,This bibs are the best of all worlds...,"After the recent recall in practically all vinyl bibs, I went on a hunt to find some waterproof ones that would still be safe for my toddler and I found these! They are great--soft and thinner than all of the vinyl ones that can be hard and bulky, but and actually easier to clean! I just rinse them off in the sink then hang them to dry (which they do very quickly). They also have a handy pocket to catch anything that may fall.These are smaller than some of the vinyl bibs you may be used to, but they work fine on my messy toddler. And there are so many cute print to choose from (we got the Dr. Suess ones!).And they are US Made!"
5,The best bibs,I love these bibs. They work great! The pocket is big enough to catch anything that spills - with some bibs the pocket doesn't open wide enough and the food ends up in her lap but not with these. The fabric is waterproof but not stiff like most other bibs. The other ones I tried were so stiff that the bib would push up at her neck and she wouldn't be able to get to her mouth. These bibs actually lie flat at her neck and never get in the way. They rinse off great and then can just be thrown in the washer whenever needed. These are definitely the best bibs I've tried.
4,Tasty & Sweet,"This instant oatmeal is absolutely delicious. The taste is wholesome, with distinguishable cinnamon flavor and bits of dried berries. The only drawback is that it is a bit high in sugar, which will obviously turn to fat in your system. 11 grams of sugar is a lot more than good old Quaker Oats has (1 gram). From a health-standpoint, Quaker would be a better choice, but you can decide whether or not it's worth the added flavor you get with Bear Naked."
1,kids,"I ordered this for my teen who wanted help understanding and studying high school chemistry. The instruction level fell far short of high school chemistry; it's aimed more like sixth or seventh grade. Even if viewed by that level however, the presentation is very dated and uninteresting. Good luck getting students to watch this!"
2,Missing Flavor,"I made a few dishes for passover, a lot of the recipes are missing flavor. Some recipes do not have clear instructions, Roasted Chicken has instructions to bake instead of roasting. I am Jewish and my grandma's dishes are way better then Grandma Doralee's dishes, except my grandma cannot seem to give me recipes because she does not measure anything, so every time I follow her directions, the dish turns into a mess. I also did not like that 12 pages of the book are reviews and praises from other people. The book is small as it is, I don't need to spend money on praises. I would not recommend this book. I have to say one thing, her chicken soup is good, but how can you mess that up."
3,Worked till it didn't,"The plastic nipple for the feed line broke in a few days, sending fluid all over my feet. I don't know why...there's plenty of slack in the hose. Not like it's under any tension. Maybe I just got a lemon, but I didn't want to deal with it again. Worked till it didn't, and then I bought FTE."
5,It works great!,Installation was easy and it has worked great. It is easily controlled by my Kenwood stereo and we haven't had any issues.
2,Not for newest iPods or iPhones,"I bought this for an iPod Classic that I bought at the same time. While it does technically work, however, it will not charge my new iPod. Sometimes when I turn the radio on, it says that the iPod is ejected even though it's plugged in. After turning the radio off and back on, or unplugging and re-plugging the iPod, it will see the iPod but start over at playlist 1 song 1. Lately it's also had a bad habit of draining the iPod battery completely overnight. A search online for troubleshooting shows that people with the newest Apple offerings in all iPod categories are having the same issues with this adapter and even with other manufacturers' adapters. I borrowed an older iPod for testing, and it works like it's supposed to.So if you have an older iPod, this is a handy adapter for your radio. But if you have a new iPod, you should instead replace your head unit with one of the latest iPod compatible ones. Very disappointing."
3,Does no charge the Touch,I have had this along with the Garmin/ Kenwood nav for my double-din since it was released. It seems to not charge with the Touch although it does play.It works but really sucks that it's such a pain to navigate playlists. I know they want to keep selling new units but I really wish they would come out with some kind of software update or something
2,Not functional,"I have a 160gb ipod and using it with this devise is very slow. If you have to go to the letter ""R"" for example is better to disconnect it and select the song manually and reconnect. The good thing is that you get very good sound quality."
2,KCA-iP500 underwhelms,"I purchased the KCA-iP500 to use my 3rd gen iPod with my Kenwood KDC-MPV619. After a year of use I still have not found a way to accurately navigate my playlists. The random play seems to be limited to playing random songs within the sections of the playlist assigned to the cd changer slots.Most frustrating is that there is no information in the manual or on Kenwood's website telling you how to use this device effectively.It does charge the iPod which is nice and I can listen to the songs it's willing to play to me on random but I can't listen to the song I want when I want. Sound quality is also excellent and as noted in other reviews, far superior to FM transmitters.I wouldn't purchase this again. I'd look for a better solution. A head unit with full iPod control is a better option in my opinion and I will probably ditch my perfectly good Kenwood unit and KCA-iP500 to do exactly that."
2,how to buy it,"Its a good product, but its no good for the KVT819DVD, dont show all the functions of the ipod, this radio only needs the KAC I300, because you can use the USB for conect the ipod..."
5,Buen producto,"Lo conecte a mi reproductor KDC-MP2032 y funciono perfectamente. No necesita ningun cable ni conector adicional. Es un poco complejo para utilizarlo, pero es bastante eficiente. Y una de las ventajas es que mantiene cargada la bateria del iPod."
5,Very good,"I am very pleased, the product I come in the estimated time, am very satisfied with the service given by you thank you."
3,It's aight,Pro: I am now able to keep my ipod hidden in the locked glove box and out of sight.Con: The UI is not so great.
1,"Dont buy this, it doesnt work on XPS M1710","Dont buy this, it doesnt work on XPS M1710. This item only puts out 90 watts, XPS requires 130 watt power supply, your laptop will not even boot. More Chinese crap."
2,"BAD DVD, good movie!","This review if exclusivly on the DVD production and quality not the movie itself which I give a 3. First off, it's put out by Ground Zero Entertainment which is pretty much hit or miss as much of what they put out is duped from VHS and not film. This title, like most of their titles, are Pan & Scan which I really dislike. Half the action is cut out and the scans can get annoying. Although Ground Zero does put out a few titles like Shoulin Avengers which has great picture quality and is in widescreen format. Until Criterion gets a hold of these old school classics and gives them the treatment they deserve ( which is highly unlikely but who knows!?!!) look for titles put out by Crash Cinema and Celestial for good widscreen quality."
4,Nice movie to watch,"The first time I have watched this movie, I figured it was bad. The second time had watched this movie, it's worth 4 stars. I have seen better Shaw Brothers movies. Nonetheless, the story from I Kuang is always brillant."
2,Ehhhhh,"This film is too long and the first part is boring. Is a weird film only for hardcore old school Kung Fu fans. The last part of the film is what really makes the movie. Also there's no special features on this DVD. The transfer is great, it looks almost hd. I know this movie is shaw bros. classic but it didn't do it for me, skip to the fight scenes ."
5,Iontach!,A well made video. Excellently produced. Impossible to say whether the musicians or the dancers were better than the other. 100% enjoyment from start to finish.
4,great variety show,"The movie is really good. I was led to believe that there would be much more dancing than there actually was. It is a blend of instrumental pieces, dancing, and singing. Everything is well performed. The various camera angles and camera movement is a little over-kill and once in a while vaguely dizzying. But I do reccomend"
2,Repetitious Ragus,"We love Irish entertainment but were very disappointed in Ragus. After a couple songs and dances, we had seen it all. Every subsequent number was pretty much identical and it soon got boring. Also, the staging, lighting, music, etc. was not up to the high quality we have come to expect in DVDs such as The High Kings or any of the Celtic Thunder shows. Nobody in our family watched it to the end."
5,"Great Mixture of Irish Dancing, Singing and Music","I have seen Ragus live two years in a row at the Milwaukee Irish Fest and attended every one of their performances. Their performances are a great mixture of Irish dancing, singing and music.I waited patiently for them to bring out a DVD and it was well worth it. The DVD was done professionally with very good video and sound."
5,Just beautiful,"Have watched this DVD a great many times and can say there's not a moment on it that's less than superb. Except perhaps the audience's inexplicable failure to join with enthusiasm in the chorus of ""Green Grow the Rushes Oh"". The dancing is marvellous, but the music! The haunting sounds of the band's pipes, strings and ?organ are extraordinarily atmospheric and the mood builds steadily. The ""Song from Connemara"" is one of the most lovely, poignant pieces I have ever heard. If you like Irish music and dance, you will watch this again and again. It has none of the brassy glitz of some more famous shows; it's simply a totally professional performance with some of the most accomplished folk singers, dancers and musicians alive putting everything they've got into it."
5,"If you want to see ""the real deal"" in Irish music and dance, this is the DVD for you.","""Ragus"" is the best Irish music and dance DVD I have every seen. The band plays traditional Irish music in the style familiar to me from ""house parties"" with relatives in Ireland. They are exraordinarily talents musicians. The dancers are very talented and gifted. This show has run for years in the Aran Islands and they have travelled worldwide and are very popular. You don't have to be Irish to love this group - although it helps. Their energy and talent are magnificent. It is a DVD you will enjoy again and again."
3,Prettier than they are Sturdy,"I wear combs in the sides of my hair on a daily basis. All of the combs I've ever had before are plastic. These combs are very pretty, but since the prongs are made of a thin metal, after the first wearing you have to rearrange the prongs so that they're straight. I've worn them probably about five times now & it seems like the prongs may be not as strong as when I first purchased them since they fall out of my hair during the day at least once a day now. This never happens with plastic ones."
5,"Over 1,100 buildings which have earned landmark status over the past forty years","If it's one weighty, definitive library reference you need to New York City's landmarks, make it Landmarks Of New York: An Illustrated Record Of The City's Historic Buildings: its scope and format can't be beat. Art and architectural libraries as well as New York City specialty collections will welcome documentation of over 1,100 buildings which have earned landmark status over the past forty years. A chronological arrangement guides readers through a wealth of building styles and types, from farmhouses and churches to mansions, with black and white photos of each accompanying descriptions, comments on style and design, listings of architects involved in the building's construction and redesign over the decades, and style descriptions. A 'must' for any serious architectural or New York history collection."
4,"Sweet, modern day Cinderella story.","My 10 year old loved this movie, watching as often as she could within the rental period. A few parts were edgier than I would prefer, but not deal-breakers."
5,Very entertaining for the young and old.,I like this better than the previous ones with Hillary Duff and Selena Gomez because the music is awesome and Lucy Hale played the part well plus she is gorgeous.
3,Incorrect rating,"This was a cute movie...BUT it is rated PG, and uses many swear words--it used the word Bi**h FOUR times!! We watched it at my daughters sleepover with kids from 4 to 14...i was NOT happy!!! :-/"
1,lame,"Perhaps I am tired of seeing all the Cinderella remakes (so why watch it right??? well, as I am a singer I thought it would be fun). The coolest part was the Bollywood themed party (even though everyone looks too old to be in high school). Predictable plot. Of all the remakes, I've seen better..."
5,BETTER THAN OTHERS,I am a bit of a freak for shake lights. I love the concept. Keep in mind you will never get as much light as a regular 2 D cell flashlight and you have to work for it. But in a NO light situation they are great. Also bigger is NOT better for shakers I have one that is about 3 D cell size and it is weak. I also have a very tiny one that is similarly lame. My best one came from Wallgreens for under 10 bucks and I think this is the same one. It lights up quicker and lasts longer than many costing more. I bought a bunch for gifts last Christmas and never got around to gifting them but THIS Christmas I think I will keep them and give away my others.
1,Cheap for a Reason,"This flashlight, as all the other customers who rated it a 1 star, is absolute garbage. I noticed the exact same thing about the batteries that the others did without opening the device at all. It's clear plastic and you can see that there is no way that the ""magnet"" can charge the batteries. However, this wasn't my first problem. My first problem was the shaking. I work out and use a sports shake, so I shook it about half the strength I would the sports shake or something like orange juice. After about 30 seconds, upon inspection, not only was the button unable to hold the connection (it's a slide button, I had to slide it and push it down), but the beam was very weak and the internal case holding the ""magnet"" was cracked. If you want to save money on batteries for a flashlight, I suggest finding the hand-crank flashlights. Many of them also come with a radio. I got a set of 2 for very cheap."
1,pos light,yeah quit working after 2 weeks and this thing will destrohy electronic devices its near do not be stupid and waste your money
1,No vale la pena,"El producto me llego sin empaque, roto y el brillo del led es muy bajo. Se ve que no tienen cuidado con el manejo."
1,junk,"I got two of these from my Thank you Points reward network..same lights. The one came with a screw shaking loose inside but the real problem is that these flashlights lasted one day. They no longer hold a charge and when they did...not very bright. They are not true battery freel shake lights. You can see the 3 little button cell batteries inside..and these are what I think was giving me the little bit of light at first..Absolute junk..cheap plastic feel, switch is cheap..nothing quality about it. Came with a box with typos all over it..not address of the company. Do not wasted your time or money on this junk."
1,Not a Shake Light,"I purchased several of these lights (15 of them) to use as a teaching tool in a university undergraduate lab. I received them yesterday, upon inspection of the flashlight I found the following: The inductive coil IS NOT connected to anything, the slug which slides back and forth is not a magnet, the rectifier (diodes) which would be necessary to charge the light (and are pictured on the packaging) are not populated on the board. The lights work solely on two small batteries, when those are done, you're done. Shake all you want."
1,"this one is fake, coil is not connected, no electronics","Disassembly of the unit was very disappointing.The light is driven by the two 2032 coin cells.The coin cells are not rechargeable, they are ""use once"".There is nothing electronic except the LED itself.The coil is not connected to anything, this is acomplete deliberate fake as far as I can tell."
1,Product not as reviewed,"I was disappointed when we received this item that it wasn't the one pictured, or apparently the same item other people reviewed. Ours hardly lights itself up, even while shaking it. It won't project enough of a beam to be at all useful at any time. Also, there's a small loose screw bouncing around inside and it makes it short out sometimes. Bait and switch, total rip-off."
1,not so good,"i didnt buy this from this person that selling it. i bought it from the web page where was sold orginally. it work find after a while dont remember how long. but the light got dimmer, dont wasted ur money on this not a very good product."
2,Maybe I got a bad one but I think they are junk,The light is not very bright and I'm going to get tennis elbow shaking the dang thing. Get a hand crank or solar. Thumbs down to this flashlight.
4,"HR reference guide ""par excellence""","Finally, a ""how do I handle"" guide written for any manager seeking instant direction & expertise. The question format is ideal, facilitating speedy navigation, the flow within each subject area transports the reader logically through the process and the advice is right on target. The ""lessons learned"" boxes throughout the book serve to add useful reference points on how others have dealt with the issue at hand. The Resource Guide, Tools & Templates and the Index collectively represent invaluable tools, especially for small-company management who may not have in-house HR assistance. Overall, an impressive achievement for a book which follows through with practical, accurate answers and solutions."
5,fun songs,Our kids love this cd. It's got all the songs they know from their favorite Disney and Pixar movies. They even use it at a bedtime cd.
3,B-sides of Disney,Enjoyable album of lesser known songs from Disney films. I didn't recognize several of the songs. Sound quality was very good on all songs.
5,Disney Greatest Hits CD,"Great CD! Our son loves it and sings along when he knows the words. If you have a little who likes Disney movies, this CD is one for you and your little one(s)!"
4,Disney Pixar review,This a great collection of hits from both Pixar and Disney and it has a nice variety and the perfect cd to play in the car on long trips because it has songs that both kids and parents will like and reduce the likely hood of comlaints from the kids that they don't like the music Mom and Dad put on. It will not be hard to find favorites on this cd. I recommend this cd by Disney and Pixar.
4,Disney music,"The music is great! We got it in a timely matter.The one complaint is that there was a 3 inch crack in the CD case (unopened wrapping), but the CD itself was fine."
3,"a little disappointed, but half of it is good","I really should have read about all of the songs on it. Quite a bit of it is the score to each movie...all instrumental. I really got it for the ""Cars"" song, Life is a Highway, which is performed by the original artist, who is a little rougher than Rascal Flatts. Maybe I should have got their CD instead. My son likes it, but there's just not a lot of content with lyrics to sign to. And, listening to the two Randy Newman songs is tedious. Seriously."
3,So-so CD,CD begins with around 5 songs that are either sub-par or depressing. I bought the CD for the instrumental works that come after the first few songs. I was looking for a CD to play in the background of the lobby while my preschool parents had to wait before graduation. The second half of the CD is perfect for that. Do not buy if you are looking for feel-good children's music. I would suggest a Disney CD for that.
2,Buyer Beware,"This is not what you think. Only a few songs with lyrics, the rest are background music, many of which you won't even recognize. What a complete dissapointment and waste of money. Skip this and just buy the Toy Story Monsters Inc soundtrack. At least then you'll recognize the music!"
4,Well Done,"Ultrabeat's third release is quite good. It's production values are much higher than the debut ""Trip To A Planet Called Heaven"", and the lyrics and melodies seem a bit stronger than his stellar sophomore release, ""Beyond The Stars"". It's nice to know that quality Christian techno is possible with the right talent. However, there were a few weakpoints on this album. While most of the lyrics are stronger than before, some are still a little too simple, and the song ""Going To The Danceparty"" came off pretty cheesy, I thought. And, as already mentioned, the album does seem a bit too short. But with those minor gripes, this is a quality dance release and one to be enjoyed."
3,good product,This is a good working product but the limit of 2GB SD cards (no warning given) complicated initial operation. Very long connection cables are difficult to handle and hide.
3,Good stuff,This product work very well in my car...and i would say if anyone thinking about getting one they should. I must admit at first i was like i don't know about it. but when i used it for the first 3 days i like very happy with it.
5,Hey...Its a Garmin!!!,"I have the Kenwood KNA-G510 Nav. hooked up to the New 2009Kenwood KVT-514 DVD receiver. The Nav. is surpurbe, like a Garmin should be. There are other receivers out there that offer navigation, but you can't beat Kenwood and Garmin's track record. I doint have the Bluetooth conected yet, but I understand when you are looking up a place of business(Restaurant) You can press on the phone number and it will dial the phone number of the place (very cool). I think this is a GREAT product and will add one to my other car as well.1 word of CAUTION...KENWOOD ONLY HONORS THERE WARRANTY IF YOU BUY FROM THEIR AUTHORIZED DEALERS..(Crutchfield)."
3,Girl Friends have a right to their opinions too!,"First of all I want to say that while this book may not rate up there with ""War and Peace"" I for one liked it. I took it for what it was and kept my focus, which was on the story line and the valuable up close and personal insight that the author painfully shared regarding the tragedy at Jackson State. Shame on the reviewer who obviously ( and inappropriately I might add ) chose to use this forum to take a cheap shot. Thank God, we live in America! And yes, even girl friends can have their opinions too. At least she was woman enough to give her name. I would recommend this book to all!"
1,Just for your information ...,"Just for the readers information, Ms. Martha Valdez is the author's girlfriend. The review makes it appear that she is an uninterested party in the popularity of the book."
3,Fills our need,"This printer works fine. I don't like the way you have to hold the button for 3 seconds to turn it off... what's up with that?? But, this is a 2nd printer in the office used for just certain things. No heavy use, but it does what we ask of it."
1,If you own a MAC - forget it,I bought this printer to use with my MAC mini and I've had nothing but problems. Only the top 2 inches of any document containing a graphic (or a PDF) will print. I've been online for 3 weeks with HP and they still can't figure out how to fix the problem.
4,HP Deskjet 6940,"When I tried to install the driver, half way through the installation it said windows installer was not active. When I went into Administrative tools, Services and tried to start windows installer it said there was a 997 error and would not start. From google I found this:Run ""msiexec /regserver"" from a command line.and it worked. I also went to a site that had only the driver so I didn't have to install all of the extra stuff from the cd.As far as the printer goes I've only printed a couple of things, but am impressed with it's speed and quality, better or at least equal to my old canon i960.for now 4 stars, 5 if you didn't have to change the photo cartridge out to use."
1,Not good printer,"Not a good printer. It boasts high speeds, but at high speeds the print is shadowed and very hard to read. I sent this one back and got a Canon MP600 and am very happy with it."
1,terrible printer,This printer is a piece of junk if you need to print more than 3 double-sided pages. it constantly feeds multiple pages through on the second side. everything gets out of order -- there's half a page printed here and the other half printed over there on another piece of paper. all you have is a bunch of trash at the end. it makes you furious b/c you have a printer but you can't print what you want to without babying the thing through printing a couple of pages at a time. no one has time for that sort of nonsense. i had the same problem with my last hp printer which is why i got the new one. i guess double sided printing is just a lot to ask from the engineering wizards on the deskjet team. I know it's not their most expensive printer but it should at least be able to provide the functionality it is purported to have. I want to throw this thing off a cliff. if you buy this printer i hope your experience is much better than mine has been.
1,baaaaaad product,"HP used to make a good printer. now we have an hp graveyard in our office of four pritners less than 2 years old and each each broke within a few months. two were expensive -- then we switched to the cheap models. the cheap printers last for two years, now it is months. one never worked. getting hp to stand behind it is a problem. now we buy canon. sadly, it is not double sided but at least it runs."
5,Works well,"This printer is pretty easy to set up, and it works as promised. Pictures are of high quality as is type face. Printer seems reliable so far, it looks good, doesn't take up much space, and was reasonable priced. It was the best deal I was able to find and I'm very satisfied with it."
1,Serious Design Flaw,"When replacing print cartridges there is a folding, wire spring that contacts the cartridge. The spring easily comes out of place. If so, it will damage a printed circuit when the cartridge is installed. The printer is now worthless. I had no luck with support or repair parts. Searching for help, discovered multiple postings of this issue."
4,A Caveat for the HP 6940 Printer,"A caveat for inserting a print cartridge into the inkjet printer...make sure the printer is turned on before you lift the cover. This allows the little plate in front of the cartridge receptacles to descend...otherwise this plate interferes with the cartridge insertion. I learned the hard way...I tried to insert new cartridges with the printer turned off; hence, the plate did not descend...and I forced it. In the process, I damaged the folding, wire spring that contacts the cartridge to complete the electrical circut...rendering the printer useless in part or whole.This is an excellent inkjet printer...the mea culpa aspects aside...I've just ordered another HP 6940 Inkjet Printer from Amazon. I recommend this printer to any one...but be careful."
3,Game with words,"The printer was advertised to have wireless connectivity and we purchased it assuming that it does. This claim is wrong and misleading. During the installation process, it became clear that 6940 does not have wireless connectivity. To operate, it must be connected either through a USB cable or through an Ethernet (802.3) cable. This was confirmed by talking with HP customer service. Initially, the HP customer service technician thought that the HP 6940 has wireless connectivity, but later in the call he retracted that. Furthermore, the downloadable printer installation instructions from HP (see link below) say the 6940 can be connected to a network wirelessly, which is also wrong. In conclusion, the HP claim of the 6940 wireless connectivity is plainly misleading and fraudulent.http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00206046&lc;=en&dlc;=en&cc;=us&product;=467980⟨=en#"
4,HP Deskjet 6940 Printer,We do outdoor events and this printer is a workhorse. I own 7 of these and I highly recommend it for anyone wanting a robust printer that prints fast.
4,"Difficult installation, but excellent HP support over the 'phone.","I had to have HP support help me get this guy installed. This may have been my own system's fault (my PC) but the software with its drivers failed to completely install, and after 2 attempts I finally just opted to call HP.. I got through relatively fast and the gentleman with whom I spoke was given ""control"" over my computer to do the installation himself.. it took us over an hour, but it was finally accomplished. I must say that I don't know what I would have done without this assistance.. certainly I would have sent the product back to Amazon.In terms of performance, it out-does my earlier HP (which was twice as expensive 4 years ago).. relatively quiet, excellent resolution for ""normal"" prints.. and great color in terms of photos."
2,Same Blinking Light Problem,"I paid $99.99 for this printer, and it lasted almost 3 years with very light use by one user. I now have the same problem others have experienced--despite numerous attempts and a new ink cartridge it would not print. Instead it continued to indicate that the black cartridge was low on ink. Tried all the fixes, i.e., cleaning, unplugging etc. but it was toast. As others have noted, HP should have allowed the user to override this alert."
2,Worked great for a year!,Just like another reviewer mentioned this printer worked great until I had to change the cartridge! At first I thought my cartridges were expired so I actually returned them to the store. After trying two different cartridges I confirmed it was the printer! I kept getting error codes and could not figure out what is wrong with it. It looks brand new but unfortunately will not print now. :(
2,Fine When It Works,After I leave the 6940 on for a few days all the displays start flickering and the printer locks. What I then have to do is unplug its power cord and plug it back in. It works fine then. What I have done to eliminate this problem is to leave it turned off. If and when I decide to print something it seems to turn on automatically. After I've printed what I want to print I turn it off again. Pretty stupid. I've never had to do this with any other HP printers I've owned. When it prints it does so very nicely. Obviously since all HP printers are essentially throw aways if they don't work properly I'll live with the problem as long as it prints when I need it to.
4,HP printer,Was looking for a light duty printer to work with Vista and would fit in a small space. This HP does both. Came with disk for Vista drivers although HP rep said they would have to be downloaded. Set up easily and ready to print. I don't plan to use network capability but this one does it easily. Some confusion when printing envelopes as you get an error message but ignore and it prints fine. Quiet and efficient for limited jobs. Have not changed ink yet the lower the price the faster the ink goes!
4,One of HP's best,"I've been using this printer pretty heavily for about three months now and have had no problems with it. The set-up was easy. It came with everything I need to start printing except the USB cord. Admittedly most of my printing is black-and-white double-space test but on the few occasions when I have had to print graphics the images have come out very sharp and with a good range of colors. Also, the black toner cartridge has surprisingly good capacity--I printed at least 600 pages of mostly text before the print quality started to diminish. I highly recommend this printer to anyone doing basic home printing. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because I think it could have been better packaged and it arrived without a manual. However, I was able to get through to HP fairly quickly on the phone and a manual was sent within days."
4,"Good Printer, Tech Support not so much","I had two big requirements when I started looking for a new printer1. I rarely print anything in color so the printer must be able to print with the color cartridge empty or removed.2. It must support banner printing. I print a lot of banners, some 8 1/2 X 60 inches long. Most newer printers don't support banners.HP Presales Support recommended the Deskjet 6940 as the printer that would meet my needs. After a little issue with banner printing that I had to solve myself, the printer has been great.HP's after sales/tech support is pretty typical of what we're seeing these days. If you ask a question that isn't in their script, don't be surprised at the answer you get. I had issues with banner printing and the first support person told me ""this printer does not support banner printing"". I thought that was strange as the owner's manual states that it will.My thoughts, the Deskjet 6940 is a good basic printer with not so great tech support."
3,HP Deskjet 6940 Color Printer (C8970A#B1H),Really rue the day I bought this printer. The print quality is cheap. No way to adjust or clean the heads. It is constantly running out of ink. I bought this for the little printing I do at home. Total waste!
1,New HP6940,"I puchased this item new from Amazon.com. It appeared to be damaged, from the condition of the top cover.From the very outset, it would make a loud crashing sound when trying to print, most of the time. It would also pull extra paper occasionaly requiring a reset.After contacting HP service and running the tests they require for help, the printer is no longer functional. It failed all their tests.HP said it was under warranty (3 months) and they would replace it, but I've not heard from them in a week.Don't buy this printer, it is junk. Get an Epson, or one of several other reputable printers.Mike Drumm"
2,HP Deskjet 6940 from Computer Geeks,"Just now received my new HP Deskjet Printer from Computer Geeks, bought thru Amazon, opened the package and found that it was missing the Power Cord, Ethernet cord, CD Software and Set-up guide!!Called Computer Geeks and they were helpful in sending me a return label and said another printer would be shipped soon. When it gets here, I'll update this review. Right now, this Printer makes a poor paper weight.Gotta go and get this printer shipped back to the C Geeks.Bo"
1,Piece of junk,"Run do not walk from this piece of junk. Does not work with much software. Support is a joke. It took me three calls, over 2 hours on hold, to find out printer does not support Quicken or Quickbooks printing - at all, unless I buy third party check writing software for another $70.00 - which is more than I paid for the printer. According to support this is a ""known issue"" with no fix, which is not described on the box, in the product literature or its Website."
2,"good printer, but fussy and has a fussy install","Pretty good printers but several caveats. Typical HP junk drivers included on CD - The shovelware works fine, but the driver doesnt work...OOPSIE. D/L the driver only version from the web.I also want to warn about changing print cartridges - we have a few of these printers in remote locations and the casual user can destroy the printer by changing the print cartridge roughly. There is something in the design that doesnt take to rough handling. You can jam the spring thats located in the cartridge bay into the PCB which the cartridge needs to connect to - this wrecks the printer.Also someone wrecked one of these printers by forcing the cartridge into the bay w/o taking off the sticker that covers the printhead.Keepint all this in mind, I prefer the 6940 printer over more recent models from HP."
3,HP Deskjet Printer,Can't give a review because I can't get it to work.I followed the instructions and it will print out a page from the printer itself but not from the computer.I have to find time to investigate and try to resolve this problem.
4,mjskibba,This is my second HP Deskjet 6940. I buy this model because it is one of the very few printers whereby you can print one envelope at a time without removing the supply of paper. The product operates very well with the exception that it will grab several sheets of paper at times. Still a very good buy!
3,Slow print speed... everything else is good,Great value if print speed is not too important... much slower than previous model. But overall it works fine & save $$
2,Very difficult to use - wish I had bought another brand,"I've always had Canon printers and fax machines (although once I had an Epson printer), but thought I would buy HP this time for various reasons. I am very, very disappointed in this product. It is very hard to use, and seems flimsy. There is a whole complicated setup process to do business-size envelopes, and even then it ends up tearing the envelope flaps a lot of the time. I still have no clue as to how to do smaller-size envelopes on this printer - it does not give you the option to do that. The print quality is very good and I don't find the printer to be noisy, but in terms of setup and especially use, this is the most difficult printer I have ever owned. I wish I had bought another Canon instead."
4,Printer,Nice printer that didn't include a USB connector but otherwise a good price at less than $100
1,Goes offline and stays offline,"I purchased this printer. I installed it. After a week, it went offline and would not go online, regardless of power cycling, reading the manual, or any troubleshooting or reconnecting. It now resides in my trash can."
2,NOT WINDOWS 7 COMPATIBLE,"I purchased this printer because the specifications online indicated it was Windows 7 compatible. It is NOT. I intended to replace a HP 960 Deskjet, which worked, but had limited functionality with Windows 7. This 6940 printer won't even give me a test page. Given the cost to return it, I will likely eat the cost. This is the last time I will purchase a printer from any Amazon reseller. !@#$%"
1,Which Dukes Are These Guys?,... Poor quality. Clarinet player was awful. Trumpet player was the saving grace on this DVD. Very dissatisfied.
5,Fits 2012 Ford F-150,"Amazon states these do not fit a 2012 Ford F-150 but they do fit. If you click on the ""See all vehicles this product fits. "" you will see the vehicles stop at 2010 model year. I checked the WeatherTech website and verified they will fit. Easy to install, No drilling, and fits perfectly. I'm very happy with this purchase."
3,"Not, in the end, a compelling read","The book starts of reasonably well. Its general themes explaining why large companies tend to behave in ways that make them less effective at responding to change than the market are well described. As the book tries to show examples of companies that did or did not respond well to the forces of change in business they lose their way. Not only do they extol a number of companies seemingly purely because they were founded by friends from McKinsey, they also use Enron as a successful example! Too many of their examples have not done well since the book was published and that undermines their message. The book also lacks concrete advice, though I must confess to skimming towards the end.My takeaway? The market as a whole will ALWAYS innovate more effectively than any company so get over it and be prepared for companies to come and go and change constantly. There's not much, if anything, you can do about it."
3,"Compelling arguments, but not new","Although the authors make very interesting arguments, recognize that creative destruction is nothing new. Max Boisot has been talking about it for years, and Christensen at HBS has also been building a research stream on it. However, this book is more readable, and more grounded in current business settings than the aforementioned. Read it for a non-academic's perspective on the topic, but remember that your competitors might have had access to these ideas through academic researchers for years!"
5,It a book,"Bought this book for a class, never read it but Im sure it was life changing. Oh and it was cheap."
1,More of the same,"Making a buck writing about how the world is changing and what makes a smart company is getting old. And this is just another example.Corning- rapidly evolving into a company whose stock is down over 80% from its highs.and on and on this book and its new economy myth goes. blah blah blah blah blah blah blahThe author's are out to make a dollar off your dreams.If your excited about this kind of book you are either hanging on to yesterday's memories or your VERY late to the ""new"" economy.--- The economy will continue to be new ..... just not like it was."
4,Insightful!,"Hundreds of books in the last decade have documented the need for companies to develop the ability for rapid change. In Creative Destruction, Richard Foster and Sarah Kaplan make the case by suggesting that companies must emulate markets by abandoning some of the very operational practices that enable them to survive and adopting a mindset of ruthlessly efficiency. Markets, the authors explain, reward exceptional performance and instantly punish - and often destroy - laggards. Therefore, the only way to compete with markets in terms of stock price performance is to mimic markets in terms of operation. We from getAbstract recommend this book for the insight imbedded in this basic analogy, but adds two caveats: 1) Some of this advice is too general to be of immediate, practical use, and 2) The fact that the authors chose Enron to illustrate many of their basic points unfortunately undermines the strength of some of their arguments."
1,Not suitable for anywhere with high water pressure,"I loved it at first and bought three of them. All three of them came apart at the seams after a few weeks of use. Metal screws into plastic. One exploded in the middle of the night and spewed water all over the yard for an hour before anyone woke up and heard the water flowing. I love the idea, but this one doesn't seem to work well."
2,Need to replace every 1-2 seasons.,"Over the past 6 years I've owned and replaced a number of these Melnor timers. Why do I keep purchasing them? They are cheap and do their job initially - usually working just fine for a season or two. I take them off and store them during the cold winters in an effort to prevent them from breaking sooner with little luck. The all plastic construction means the timer is eventually going to fail.I've found the most common failures are that the timer no longer completely shuts off and/or the timer begins to restrict the water flow as if it's turned partially off. I'm definitely looking for a better made hose timer option, these plastic melnor timers just aren't cutting it for me anymore."
2,"Two failed, trying another brand","I had one that seemed to get inaccurate then failed altogether, now it's relatively new replacement has failed. I'm trying another brand."
2,This WAS a good product,"I replaced the first unit because it did not weather the winter - it froze and broke. The second unit stopped timing and the timer mechanism was sporadic. Sometimes it did work. The replacement for this unit (within the first year of use) has a different, less defined time dial that does not allow for fewer minutes and I found the housing was cracked the first time I used it. I will return it and will be looking for a different brand of mechanical timer."
1,Got only 3 months out of it,I expected this timer to last more than three months. It will turn the water on and off but will not allow me to set the time the water should be on. Phooey!
3,Second failure of attach point,"I bought two of these and over time the attach point failed. The threaded portion split. I have 55 p.s.i. regulated pressure. It did not fail from tugging on the hose, I have the hose strapped to a separate verticle pipe to prevent such failures. It needs more durable engineering."
2,Low end timers,"We bought two and both ceased functioning after one season. The first failure came the first week while pulling out the hose line to setup a sprinkler. I pulled out the slack, and without pulling very hard on the line, the thin plastic neck snapped, causing the hose assembly to fall to the ground. The second unit began intermittently working after about four months of service under ginger treatment. At the end of the season the once-loud time-bomb tick-tock faded and it no longer interrupted the water flow. Counting on a timer to work and it not working is obviously worse than never relying on one to begin with."
2,Great idea but plastic junk,"Bought this less than 8 months ago. It works well but now the collar that screws onto the hose bibb (""the spigot"", for those who are plumbing-challenged) has cracked. I had a flood in the backyard for that probably went on for 2 days.It's a shame, too, becuase it's a great little tool if you like to drip water your trees/shrubs. Just cruddy workmanship."
2,Melnor Real Automatic Water Timer,"This product works exactly as described. It is simple, so easy, so convenient, we really enjoy using this.NO MORE FORGETTING THE SPRINKLER IS ON!!! We like the way it turns the water off at the faucet, not leaving pressure in the garden hose.If your water rates are as bad as ours in McHenry MS, you need one or several of these (we have 5), Melnor has always been an excellent quality product."
1,Garbage,This is the first review I have written for any product. I bought three of these timers and they all cracked within 3 months of owning them. Complete garbage.
4,A Real dog-sledding book,"A great book. If you like the works of Jack London, you'll love this modern true story of an elderly man trying to run the ididerot dog-sled race. It has all the drama of a great novel and the author thankfully does not confuse his readers by engaging in jargain that his readers might not understand. He spends less time on the actual race than you might like, but other than that, it is a perfect work."
3,Recycled 80's New Age,"Much of this music has previously appeared on other compilations, like Hearts of Space, and there is little new or innovative here to recommend this disc. Also, for a disc released in 1995, too many of the pieces date to the 80's and definitely have the ring of 80's New Age. Whoever was tasked with assembling this disc either has a thing for 80's New Age, or is not familiar with the entire electronic music world, and therefor did not stray much outside the comfort zone of mainstream ""soft"" electronica. I give this disc 3 stars, though, for the inclusion of Davol, Skipper Wise & Tim Timmermans, and the Kevin Braheny 'Sarflight' tracks. The rest I either already had on other albums, or did not have at all because it's not my cup of tea."
4,"Good content, pity no editor","Good, informative book, but could have used an English mother-tongue editor to correct the many mistakes. Every page has grammatical errors (and spelling and typing errors) which luckily the good quality content allows us to forgive. But shoot the editor please (or find one for your next book)."
4,Throrough survey of the platform,"I received this book for review, and found it to be a good survey of the entire .NET platform. Its length (>800 pages) is justified by the sheer number of topics touched on - consider this small sampling:Thread local storageAnonymous methods in C#Asynchronous ADO.NET requestsFinalizersXmlDocumentStream compression in System.IODistributed transactions and resource managersMaster pages in ASP.NETBasically, if it's in the .NET platform you'll find it in this book. Coverage of each topic is short and concise, and usually includes a small sample that is easy to understand.If you're looking for a single book to give you a better grasp of the breadth of this platform, this book should fit the bill nicely."
3,"Decent content, bad english grammar","Although this book has some decent chapters, but it takes a while to really understand what the author's trying to say. His English is really bad and you will probably need to read it more than once to be able to understand him.I would recommend Andrew's book if you want to see how a good .Net book should be written http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590594193/ref=pd_sim_b_5/102-3922204-9196903?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v;=glance&n;=283155"
4,"Great book, highly recommend it...","I rarely write book reviews. However, this book is very good. I own several .NET books, this is by far the best of the bunch. Some of the material was review for me but I still enjoyed it. I would say that the target audience is from beginner to intermediate. If you are a very experienced ASP 2.0 dev, then there probably not as much value for you. That is not to say that there is not advanced topics, because there are. The only downside to this book is that it contains many, many, many grammatical errors. Thus the 4 star rating and not the 5."
5,Book with a lot of added value,"this book succeeded to cover a wide range of topics with a respectable amount of details besides clarifying the big picture for that topic, which simply producesforeach (Page page in book.Pages){????MyKnowledge.AddValue( page ) ;}Hope you enjoy this book like I did :)"
5,Superb Reference book,I've been in the process of writing training material for the .NET Framework for Microsoft Learning and have found this book beyond helpful. Patrick does a great job covering just about every conceivable topic in great depth and with very practical and useful books.Recently i've read just about every Framework 2.0 and C#2.0 book out there are many excellent ones - Patrick's book unquestionably falls in the Excellent category.I highly recommend this to anyone interested in learning the 2.0 Framework or advancing their knowledge of the 2.0 Framework.
5,Comprehensive and thorough,"The book is very well-written and very comprehensive, covering the common language runtine, the C# language and the framework in 800 pages. The author put a lot of energy into this book, and it shows with a lot of deep insight and behind the scenes information on how features work, including, for example, Reflector screenshots and the generated IL output for a feature. I find myself reading sections on topics I am very knowledgeable to see if there was any information that I missed."
2,"Horrible English, decent content","Leave it to a French-speaking editor to have the nerve to assume that her English is as good as a native speaker. The book would have been better edited at the hands of a 6th grader. If you speak French, you may have slightly better time deciphering the ridiculous grammar.On the other hand, if English is your dominant tongue, you are going to be very distracted by numerous grammatical and vocab errors. It is obvious that the author has solid .NET knowledge. Here and there, through horrible English, you may divine the intent of various sections.If someone has gifted you the book, use it as backup reference. Otherwise, I recommend Juval Lowy's .NET Components (2nd Edition) as a solid alternative. Lowy's message and knowledge can easily be understood by anyone who is proficient in English because the book is obviously edited by a native speaker."
5,Great all-in one book!,"I recieved an early copy of the book through ParadoxalPress.com and I have to say this book is a great all-in-one for the 2.0 .NET Framework! It covers all the basics of the framework and C# while extensively covering the improvements to the 2.0 version of the framework. At almost 900 pages, this brick will definetly be the ultimate reference."
3,WORTH READING,"This book was ok, but the author skipped around so much that you did not know if it was the present or the future that she was referring to. I would check it out at the library instead of spending the money on it."
3,It's ok...,"This could easily have been a five star read. I absolutely love reading about people living in haunted houses, but I hate it when they try to analyze the phenomena. There is no explaining ""ghosts"", and really no point in trying if you're not a qualified scientist.Much of the writing in this book is repetitive which made this book a bit of a pain for me to finish. I really wish I could tell you how many times the author talked about coincidences, the number three, and how they are oh so psychically aware since living in their Evergreen home.This book didn't even scare me until I got to the very end where the author was theorising what the source of paranormal phenomena is.If your looking for a good ghost story I would suggest you look for it in a different book."
4,$400?????,"I look over the items I have purchased sometimes...$400 plus for this one??? This is very good despite the grammatical errors but that price is unreal. I could use the cash so call me for my read once copy, ha...no seriously it is good but don't pay that much, ok? It is not as good as A DARK PLACE and I didn't pay nearly that much for it. Not exactly a review I know but I am concerned about the price."
3,"Misspellings, confusing chronology makes uninteresting","A friend recommended this book to me. I love books about ""true"" hauntings, but I was really disappointed with this one. The narrative is truly confusing, with much skipping around,seques that have nothing to do with the story, and misuse of words, which at times, make reading quite hilarious. (I'm not obsesssive enough to list them here).This would be a great book if someone who could write would do so. As it stands, it is strictly an amateur effort."
5,Great Bible for children,"I gave this Bible to my precious granddaughter.the seller delivered it quickly.since it is out of print, it was hard to find.John MacArthur is a great man of God who brings the truth of the Bible to us in understandable terms."
3,Nice,"Altho I like the hummingbird I was dissapointed, I didn't read the description well obviously as I was expecting it to change colors like the butterfly and dragonfly but it is solid white colored. But it is still a very nice product."
3,It was nice till it work,"It only lasted for a month, and then stopped working, so no use, for that price its not worth at all. I got this light from Home depot though..."
3,A curious book.,"This work needs a complete reorganisation. Written as though the author was drifting into and out of consciousness, I eventually reached the conclusion that, whilst the information is all there, the final product is so disjointed it makes reading the work - and thereby understanding the relevant events, most difficult.If the reader is looking for a readable account of Operation Hailstone (at least this author ""did"" correctly call it Hailstone and not ""Hailstorm"" as some writers would have us believe the US attack on Truk was called) this is not the book for you. If, however, the reader is more interested in research and ""detail,"" then there is much information in this rather poorly produced work which I have not seen included elsewhere and the book is worth purchasing for that alone.The photographs are of equally poor quality with only two being of much interest.NM"
4,GREAT METAL WITH GREAT GUITAR,Having just picked this up I was wondering what I'd get. With so many personnel changes over the years it's always a crapshoot with Metal Church. Never fear gentle listener for this album rocks. The guitar of Vanderhoof is incredible and has been the consistenly great factor of all Metal Church releases. If you like no frills metal played like it matters this is one to hunt down. A better album vocally than Masterpeace it was a pleasant surprise. Go to church Y'all.
4,Metal Church what else to say!,Well I had to add this to my collection and I'm so glad I did. The new Metal Church has such great sound. Not everyone I talk to Like's Ronnie Munroe's voice but I think he's killer. Love it!!!! Love This Present Wasteland as well. Check out rare Wayne's Metal Church it is awesome too with great sound!!!
4,A very good release,"This Metal Church lineup has very little resemblance to the original lineup but is still a very good album with lots of cool riffs. The singing takes a little getting used too, afterall its not David Wayne and to most people he is the voice of Metal Church. Lots of political statements and some all around good thrash make this CD worth buying if you are a Metal Church fan or just want to hear some good thrash thats not overly fast or brutal."
3,this is a joke right?!,"this isn't metal church!this is metal church fronted by some crappy emo kid!i listened to this cd three or four timesand yes it does grow on you alittlebut this is by far the worst metal church cd thus farthis ronnie guy SUCKS!he doesn't come close to being as good as mike howeand he damn sure doesn't compare to david waynethe music is typical metal churchbut the vocals scream ""hey look at me i'm an amature""if your just getting into the church, check out anything with david wayne or mike howe in the vocal department.for those of us already into the church, welcome to hell and disappointment!"
2,Tasan's challenge,Perhaps the whole thing was about the style. I am not well aware of the new things in neoconfucianism added by Tason. But his spirits and style were just what the neoconfucianism at the time needed the most.
1,disappointed,"I ordered the Solvitex cargo liner because its materials as described (cotton & polyester) seemed straightforward and non-toxic, for the sake of our dog and ourselves in our new car. However when I took the cargo liner out of its box, there was an odor strong enough to give me an almost instantaneous headache. I tried airing it out but the odor didn't completely go away. Rather than subject ourselves and our dog to whatever volatile compound this was in close quarters, I sent the cargo liner back."
4,Fits nicely in 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee,"This cargo liner has worked nicely in my 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The velcro strips really do grip the fabric in the Jeep. We haven't had to use the other strips they include in the box as the front and back velcro does the job. My recommendation is to keep the box it comes in, and fold the liner into itself and put it back in the box when not in use.Of note, the liner is not wide enough (in my Jeep anyway) to cover the sides, so there is still dog hair that gets on the interior, but for our vehicle, that part is plastic and easy to wipe off."
3,"Durable material, but slips and slides a lot","The material is very durable. However, it is quite over-sized even for my Pathfinder. This wouldn't really be a problem, except that the velcro straps are placed on the edge of the pad which makes it impossible for me to use them to mount into the cargo area. I have 2 dogs and after a short ride to the park, the liner is bunched up. This adhesive strips aren't very adhesive at all, and won't stick to the plastic molding up the sides of the cargo area either. I will have to try to figure out an alternative way to use mount it more securely..."
2,Far from their prime!,"Sorry to say, but this is not so good. It's hard to believe it's the same band that released the brilliant ""Expect no mercy"" (5 stars indeed) just a year earlier. I don't know if it has to do with Zal Cleminson (new second guitarist), or if the band just ran out of inspiration. Some even think ""No mean city"" is the worst Nazareth album ever but that's might not be the case... However, there's a couple decent songs like ""Star"", ""May the sunshine"" and ""Whatever you want babe"", where the band is recognizable. This is not a good starting point to explore Nazareth, but dedicated fans will probably find pleasure in this release."
3,An uneven effort,"The great Art work was what made me buy my first Nazareth album, but it was almost my last after I listened to the entire thing!While many fans thought it was great that Zal Cleminson had joined the band, I had mixed feelings. ""Expect No Mercy"" was great and this follow up is lacking.""May The Sunshine"" and ""Star"" (which inspired Human League's ""Don't You Want Me Baby"" snythesizer hit)are excellent. But the hard rocking stuff is second rate. The opening tune is poor, a bad sign, and while Dan does what he can with his vocals to keep things interesting it is tough to listen to the entire CD, the best riff being recycled from ""Hair of the Dog""."
5,'Best ' dictionary i have ever bought !!,"If you are an interpreter, this glossary is indispensible in your book shelf, and if you are a translator, it is a MUST to have a copy of this glossary.Personally, i have to thank Mrs. Orellana for publishing such an invaluable piece of work."
5,Thorough and thoughtful,"Jobes' work is my go-to for solid exegesis and exposition on 1 Peter. Not only does she carefully lay out the arguments of others, she offers carefully detailed, new arguments of her own to add to the mix. I find her suggestion that the ""foreigners"" of 1 Peter were Christians (both Jewish and Gentile) who were expelled from Rome to be compelling. The introduction alone is worth the price of the book.Her work is invaluable for sermon preparation. Thanks, Karen!"
2,Disappointed,"I was looking for a handy nutmeg grinder. The body of this one comes apart in two pieces, exposing the grater. You grate into the bottom half and then use it as a shaker to let the bits out. It's big enough to hold a couple unground nuts. The pieces don't fit together well at all. The grater doesn't work that well on nutmeg, too grabby. It is frankly a pain to use, so I've gone back to my flat parmesan cheese grater and spice jar."
4,Just what I needed,"I really wanted something to store and and grate nutmeg. Not only does this store the whole nutmeg but also stores any leftover grated nutmeg, too. Recommend for anyone who regularly used freshly grated nutmeg."
5,Great book,"Great book, very comprehensive. The book is kind of ""pocket book"" quality but it can be read perfectly and it made me save many $$."
2,"Easily Read Survey, But Nefariously Biased","Martin Gilbert produces a well-written account of Israel's history. However, he gives the reader the impression that he covers all the facts and perspectives, when in reality he does no such thing and writes a biased, pro-Israeli, pro-Jewish history of Israel. Gilbert relies too heavily on the memoirs of important Jewish historical figures, thus skewing his history. He also fails to mention a number of important events such as the Kfar Kassem massacre and the 1971 peace overture by Egypt and Jordan. By ignoring these events and focusing on the barbarity of certain arab governments, Gilbert turns what could have been a comprehensive, honest telling of Israel's history into another piece of propoganda."
4,Very informative,Interesting perspective on an ancient people and a modern nation. I would recommend this to anyone that has an interest in Israel past and present.
2,"Pacific coast tides, NOT","I ordered this watch as it was new and looked like you could set it to your corresponding area. It does let you set the tide indicator but not for Pacific ocean tides. It is way off. One day to know that the tides were wrong. For a surfer or someone who crosses river bars on the Pacific, this watches tide function is useless. Tide feature was the main reason that I bought the watch.Other than the tide issue, the watch is very nice and feels very solid. It is heavy and I like it as a watch but I am returning it to get a watch that can handle Pacific tides."
2,Tide watch,"The tide function works well, It is clear and usefull. The watch time keeping is not very good. The watch loses time at odd moments. As much as 20 minutes to an hour and a half in an evening, not every day but some of the time. All in all not a good value."
3,Cool watch!,"I have owned two of these watches, and loved the look, the heft and the functions. Unfortunately, one died after I trusted a Mall watch repair kiosk to replace the battery, and the other one quit running on it's own after a year or two. I got lots of compliments on the looks of this watch, and liked the tide function (I'm a sailor). Dressy enough to go anywhere, too!"
1,"If it won't keep time, the bells and whistles don't matter.","This was a gift for my son, a Charter Fishing Captain. Unfortunately, despite all the nice bells and whistles on this watch, it does not keep time. It loses at least 15 minutes to 1-1/2 hrs a day. I am returning the watch."
5,A guide to the Christian view of faith,Bruce Bickel and Stan Jantz have combined their talents to produce many books about Christianity. They usually contain the '______ 101' style of title and it effectively conveys that the book will be an informative piece but written in a common person's language. The authors have a true gift of humour in their writings and it produces a product that is enjoyable to read as well as having enough detail to give a solid foundation on the subject. I highly recommend any of their books to someone who wants to know about Christianity or who has recently become a Christian and wants to grow in faith. About the only person who would not find this series of books to be beneficial would be a serious seminary student or Biblical scholar but only because they do not delve too deeply into the complexities of theology.
3,2 and 1/2 really...,this was one of the very few bruce and stan outlines i read all the way through. harvest house publishes everything these 2 men touch.
4,Arnica Montana30x 250 tablets,We like this product because it's natural & we don't care for prescription drugs. There is no side affects. It won't damage your liver like over the counter pain medications will.
1,Why are the Directions covered up?,Why does this vendor cover the dosing directions with another bar code label? I was able to remove part of it to barely see the directions. Makes me wonder about the quality of the product and the vendor.It would have been helpful if these same directions were included in the Amazon product description. These pills are intended to be dissolved under the tongue not swallowed. Dosage is 4 pills - 4 times a day. The bottle provides 15.625 days of medication. Why not dispense a quantity equal to full days?Hope the product works!
1,Waste of time and money,"Got this along with the Arnicare Cream. Used these on many occasions with absolutely NO noticeable benefit. Easy to take, just put the little tabs under your tongue and let them dissolve. They dissolve very quickly, and have a sweet, sugary taste - candy-like.No pain relief came from using this ALONG with the cream, and I had a bruise that did not go away very quickly while using these tabs AND the cream at the same time. Put the cream on my sore muscles, and on the bruise at least 6 - 7 times a day for over two weeks. Absolutely NO benefit!Save your money"
3,ok,"I have exp. a mild to moderate positive effect. However, I have had skin rash when I take 3X 4 pills so I reduced the dosage."
3,Arnika from Highland Pharmacy,"The product seems to be good, however I do have negative feelings about the Highland''s customer service.. A few months ago, I had an issue relating to a shipment from Hi of the product. I emailed Highland at least five times. There was NO response or EVEN any acknowledgement. My experience was quite frustrating. A company has to be responsive to its clients, otherwise the business will loose clients, like myself. The product seems to be OK, however I will NOT recommend Highland to others. I would suggest that Amazon provide us with an alternate source, (at least).John"
2,Taste is awful,This works but the taste is god awful. I will go back to using the pellets that don't taste like chalk.
5,BEST THERE IS,NATURAL PRODUCT. I USED IT BEFORE SEVERE DENTAL SURGERY ANDNO BLACK AND BLUE JAW LINE TO TELL THE STORY.
4,For surgical bruising,"It is hard to tell but fit claims to reduce bruising and swelling after surgery. I'm not sure how ""good"" one can look after an operation but I think it did help minimize and that is what feedback I got from surgical post op team."
4,"Safe, easy, effective!","I had some bruising and swelling around my eyes. Taking the 30x 4 a day reduced the bruising so much that the staff at the doctor's office were amazed. Make sure to get the 30x potency and not the weaker 6x. They stopped selling the 30x at my local healthfood store and just the 6x so I was relieved to find it on amazon.com. I've recommended this stuff (and had it recommended to me by several people in San Diego) to many of my friends and acquaintances. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's a pain to take 4 tabs four times a day.. although easy, it's a lot of times to take something per day. If you have bruising, take it.. it's great stuff."
4,Speedy healing for bruising,"I was suggested to take this a few days before my breast reduction surgery and for ten days after to reduce swelling and bruising by many individuals on www.breasthealthonline.com.Having been one week post op, I've been getting many compliments on how fast my bruising is going away. I still have swelling, but am not too suprised about that. I would recommend this for anyone going through surgery that envolves bruising post op.They are very very small tablets you put under your tongue to dissolve four times a day (four tablets each time). Haven't had any side affects, only bruising that is going away easily!"
3,Benefit Unknown,"Retrieving luggage from an overhead compartment I somehow injured my hand which resulted in an immediate and severe hematoma of my upper hand resulting in a bump almost the size of a golf ball. Over the next hours it spread across the hand and involved even most of my fingers. The dark blue swelling eventually flattened out to about 3/4"" height after two days. It was initially treated with ice followed by Arnica cream for several days on advice of a physician. Finally, I also took Arnica tablets. The color and swelling slowly decreased and after six weeks the hand is back to normal color and nearly normal size. I can't tell if Arnica helped as I never had anything like that before, but it certainly did not have an adverse effect."
2,Incorrect Product info.,"I have no doubts that for the correct application and intended pairing of this device with a CB, this would be an amazing speaker. The issue is that the Midland CB Radio I had purchased requires a 5-Watt 8-Ohm speaker, as this was advertised and what I received in the package was a 15-Watt 4-Ohm speaker.Mounting is amazing, and it seems like a sturdy speaker with great/easy mounting hardware.However, it is not nearly as loud as I would appreciate due to it requiring a 15-Watt output."
4,Enjoyed the first half!,I have not completed this book after owning it for more then 6 months. I enjoyed the father-son interaction and contrast that the book provided. Me and my dad enjoy similar kind of back an forth as we both are MBA's who are total opposites in the way we work. For some reason i stopped reading it at some point and now i am not able to go back to it.Might be best to read it at one go :)
5,Excellent for kids in difficult family situations,The Maestro in the book seems to resemble Glen Gould. Any connection
2,A good idea badly written,"I wanted to like this book. It sounded like a great concept. But I couldn't get past the first 50 pages. When I read fiction I want to get caught up in the story and enjoy it. This book was irritating. It's a series of stories written in third person, a la Mother Goose, interspersed with ridiculous scenes of ""Mother Goose"" talking to her listeners. Actually, the author has her laughing her sentences rather than saying them. God does she need an editor. ""'New codes are begging to be opened within me and I need to turn my attention to the attainment of their frequency. In other words, I have to get to work on myself!' The whole group laughed at Leah's last remark and the matter-of-fact way she stated it. She joined them, then asked if they had any questions or if there was any additional background information they felt they might need. Katy cleared her throat and ventured forth with a question."" Ugh."
3,An important Prequel,"Rating this book with stars (appropriate, given the subject matter) is difficult as the rating depends on who is reading it and why.As literature, 3 stars, as it is not particularly well written, although it becomes somewhat better as the book progresses. It also covers ground that is already well known and explored within the metaphysical community.However, for someone unfamiliar with the concepts, it is a good basic introduction, so 4 stars.I recommend the book as it will prepare the reader for the more complex and much better written companion book, Brotherhood of the Magi, which I rate at 5 stars."
5,Great book,The book is fantastic - came right on time. Great customer service. I bought the book based on what I was told in a Akashic reading. I was told I was part of this lineage so I went with it and bought it. Have not read it yet but I am getting ready to.
4,codes of light,"Written in story format, making it easier to embrace at ones' current level of interest and belief. Chapter sections are complete stories in themselves and hold the reader's attention, while allowing for time to consider the story as a whole, and then how it fits with the other events and stories described therein. Interesting ideas!"
2,Why download?,"Much as I love Jupiter Moon, downloading individual episodes doesn't make a lot of sense. You need to see a number of episodes together to follow the story -- it is a soap opera after all -- and if you download all the episodes it will cost twice as much as ordering the disks! If you like realistic science fiction and soap opera, this is the series for you. If not, don't bother with this and be disappointed."
5,Been looking a long time for this movie,"I 1st saw this on VHS back in the 80's. The real gem of this double feature is Shaolin Traitor. The dubbing is hilarious, the fights are cool and the whole movie is just entertaining. I got this for $7 and it's a real bargain for the martial arts enthusiast. Or, even someone looking for a good laugh."
2,Rebel of Shaolin,"Fights in movie: not badEnd fight: Pretty good.Story/Plot: Boring, Crappy.End Fight: GoodThe end fight to Shaolin Traitorous is way better.I bought this for .50 cents - since its not a good movie worth the price range of 1.00 - 1,000,000.00 for a copy."
5,Very thorough teaching method,"This product really helps to learn all about music. I have all three volumes, and I can't express how wonderful it is. From the beginning, you learn what a note is, how it looks, and what it sounds like (just like a Music For Dummies, but interactive). By the end, you can read complex scores like a professional musician.This is probably the greatest teaching tool for students (or adults) who want to learn how to read music from scratch. It is very well-organized and easy to use."
2,"Bit Looks great, Poorly packaged, And bearing NOT included like picture!!!","I just received this bit today and was excited to have finally have found a bit with a 1 1/2"" bearing. It was going to be used for routering 5/8"" roundover hinges attached to a 1 1/4"" x 15/64"" CMT Dado bit that I had already bought. Amazon please change this picture so it doesn't show a router bit with an accessory that isn't included!! (1 1/2"" bearing}I found what appears to be the right bit and bearing combo though. 1 1/2""..... CMT 852.504.11BHope this helps anyone looking at this. Also this bit came in a plastic case which had been very poorly protected. The case had broken and the bit had been banging all around. Carbide looked fine though. Over and out..."
3,Not what I thought I was ordering,"This product came, it looks like a nice bit but when I ordered it I saw a different picture and description so I'm dissapointed that I have to order again. It didn't cost a lot and not worth sending it back, but I'll order from a different company next time. This was not shipped from Amazon, but from another retailer."
1,Don't waste time,"Originally called ""Kung Fu Warlords"", thismovie was the beginning of a classic four part (!)movie series which is absolutely worth seeing ifyou are an old school / Shaw bros. fan. However,despite a great cast and an interesting story, this versionis indeed swiped off the telly (you see a break for commercial2 or 3 times), looks terrible, and - worse than all the rest-is missing about an hour's worth of footage. Rent if youmust see it, the Ground Zero edition was not worth their releasing it."
1,The Worst Shaw Brothers Movie I have ever seen.,"This movie is quite lame considering the cast and crew. It was definately recorded from tv. You can easily see where the recorder stopped for commercials. At one point you can almost make out the station identification at the break. Despite the great cast the kung fu is quite bland, and the acting is hideous. I believe the person recording this movie forgot to hit record after one of the commercials. There is way to much important information missing when names and events are mentioned."
1,Pretty awful,"This 83-page booklet relies liberally on long quotations (Ida Rolf, Moshe Feldenkrais, and Wilhelm Reich are some of the usual suspects quoted). All the author seems to have really done is to gather together information from others.Physically, the book is a very primitive desktop publication. Particularly galling are some stick-figure ""illustrations"" that look like they were done in Paint in the late '80s.I can't recommend this book to anyone."
2,Doesn't quite make it,"I found this book frustrating, primarily because I think Ms. Koch probably has a lot to offer, but this book does a poor job of conveying it. I found the text and illustrations confusing and poorly edited."
1,Returned,"To date, this is my only Amazon return. I purchase almost all media from Amazon; if it's not what I expect I generally resell or give away because returns are a nuisance. I was so disappointed with this book I was glad to jump through the return ""hoops"".A simple psoas google search will result in far better and more thorough information than this book has to offer. I was eager to learn the psoas release techniques from the author who had ""studied the psoas for over 25 years"". Her big breakthrough is the ""wind relieving pose"" you perform in any hot yoga class. Not exactly what I was expecting.This book was a waste of time and money."
2,Poorly written and confusing,This book is in serious need of rewriting! I got so frustrated trying to make sense of some of the instructions that in the end I had to email the author to find out whether there were some pages missing between the text on p.57 & p.58!This is a very expensive price for such a slim book with poorly drawn stick figure illustrations.
2,"lots of floof, not so much info","I was really hoping to find out more about the action, interaction, and influence of the different aspects of the psoas and its fascia. I believe it is a complicated muscle / fascial area with varying effects on the spine, hip, and whole body, depending on which fibers are tight. This book did NOTHING to help me with understanding the psoas from that perspective. Since the ENTIRE BOOK is about the psoas, how could that be missing??? Also, it could have used some editing."
3,Back Book,"I don't believe I am as pleased with this book as Iwould have been with others on the same subject.Author is the original, but I believe some others may have improved it."
1,Not a useful resource,"This book was chock full of editing errors, some of them quite significant. Some of the errors affected the content and sense of the material. Spelling, grammar, facts and consistency were all extraordinarily poor. In just one of many examples, the text refers to an illustration that is nowhere to be found in the book; yet it is an important reference. There is really very little useful material in this book, even if one can ignore the errors. Those errors, however, make one distrust the entire content. Ms. Koch may be knowledgeable, but she desperately needs an editor!!"
5,The Psoas Book - explains a key muscle,"The Psoas Book explains a key muscle and provides useful ways to explore the reader's psoas muscle - how to relax it and how to strengthen it. As a yoga teacher, I find that people are coming to class and asking about how to get help for the psoas muscle. I recommend this book to yoga teachers, to yoga students and to anyone seeking to get a better understanding of the function of their psoas muscle. I have recently given this book as a gift and have recently had to buy another copy for myself because the person I loaned my book to is still using it. This is a very helpful book!"
4,The Psoas book,"This is typically a book that was written by a passion driven author who wants to share her speciality. I was amazed how important this muscle is and how many relationships it has with other parts of the body. I do not have a medical background, so certtain parts of this book were not very easy to get through but on a meta level I could pick up the general message, other parts need a little more re-reading. I am Dutch so the language of the specialism is a bit of an extra barrier. But good value for money, that's for sure."
3,A satisfactory resource,"The opening dedication has a glaring grammatical error that really set me aback, not to mention elementary and unhelpful graphics throughout...however the content is very well researched and informative."
5,Wealth of info,"I had an old back injury and somehow had the inner feeling that the back and my stomach problems (gas, constipation etc) were interlinked. Thank God for this book. It answered my questions and gave me effective remedial exercises to do everyday. Result better back, better stomach and smooth bowel movements."
5,Even better than expected,"I bought this ring for my niece's graduation gift, and she adores it. She wears it everyday. It is just beautiful, and still modern enough for a teenager. The quality is better than I expected."
4,Good umbrella Holder,"This is better than the holder that came with my cart. Sturdy and well made, holds the umbrella handle tightly. Arrived on the date promised and I'm 100% satisfied."
3,Good for what it is,"This device definitely provides me shade and rain protection, which is exactly what I wanted it for. The only downside is that the joints feel like they might break if I do not brace the umbrella / if a huge gust of wind hits the umbrella."
4,Golf Cart Umbrella Holder,For what it is and how little it will be used it wass a perfect purchase. Thought it would be a little more steady when umbrella in the holder and wish it were a bit more easy to put on and off but that could be me :)I still stand behind the purchase
5,I should have bought this years ago!,"I love my bag boy cart and have had it for probably 5 years now. I've always thought about getting the umbrella holder, but kinda held off because I didn't really want it that bad and felt silly spending 20 something bucks on a chunk of plastic.What I failed to realize is the value of being in the shade 90% of the time i'm on the golf course. This things awesome and well worth the money. I bought a bag boy umbrella and it holds it very well, I'd think that it'd hold just about any umbrella very snug."
3,Umbrella holder,"A well made item. You've got to find the umbrella with a handle size that will fit the receiver or the umbrella will tilt. May fall out. The umbrella can't be a standard golf umbrella,too heavy. Follow up 1/30/2013. Stopped using it year ago. Could not find an umbrella that worked well with holder. Wanted it for shade,just wear hat now.If it rains,go home."
4,bag boy umbrella holder,Item works well although I have a speed cart and it was difficult to put it on the handle. I did get it on but it took 2 people but it works great now that it is on.
3,umbrella holder,"Is a good product works well with minimal modification, needs a piece of an inch and a half PVC into holder first painted black and then umbrella fits perfect into holder with out over clamping umbrella so over all works very well. P.S.The umbrella handle now fits tight without being clamped.(Bag Boy handle)."
2,1 OUT OF 2,"The aqua gun nozzle works fine, although the squeeze trigger was a bit tough for my wife to operate. It does take a good bit of pressure to have the water start to flow. The seven-position turret model is another story. After about a half dozen uses it now sprays water out everywhere around the perimeter of the nozzle. I had the same trouble with cheaper models, and was surprised when it started with this one. Maybe thats why it's included in a two package deal."
4,Refreshingly new sound from this electronic instrumental,"This is pure instrumental music. It is also electronic ambient, and has an experimental and free form quality that gives it its freshness. In the forefront, the jazz style drum rhythms keep you guessing as to the natural beat, and the spacey motifs are reminiscent of Orbital. There is plenty to listen to in the structure of the music, and the opening track, Ark, has an irresistible feel of perpetual motion, driven on by a persistent monotonic bass-line and slow heavy drumbeat with crashing cymbals. The final track, Aphelion demonstrates inventive use of bowed instruments, and is a true masterpiece. My only gripe is that the whole experience ends in just over 40 minutes, hence the 4 stars."
2,A SAD READ!!!!,"I must say this book ""Strength from Within"" is totally not worth the money. I will admit that it's rather easy reading with many pictures. The author tends to digress a lot and at times it becomes very uninteresting. MIND-NUMBING and uninspiring is what I would say about this book.The book does however deliver as promised ""strength from within"". The only strength from within that I developed was reading the book from it's very start to it's very end. Initially I was very interested in reading this book as I'm an avid Martial Arts student who has been practicing the Arts for about a decade now. I wanted to better understand my Chi so when allowed to pick any book for a critical analysis I selected this one. But after the first few pages one quickly realizes that this book was put together rather quickly without much thought. Sadly I would not recommend this book to anyone."
5,Strength From Within,"I found Strength From Within to be very interesting reading especially the belief ""It is wise to succeed with people, not over them!"" While reading I could easily visualize the evalution of man. The author O.E.Simon is not only enlightening but inspirational, leading you through training ,exercise,purposeful meditation and success. I would like to thank O.E.Simon for sharing his knowledge,experience,concepts and beliefs with us."
3,Enchanted Wind- Background Music,Well played. Soothing sounds for intimate momentsor background in house or at party.Dr John
2,Not so user friendly,I am a Japanese language student and I found this book not user friendly. I am discouraged to use it because I could never find what I want even though something tells me what I'm looking for is in it but I could never find it. I went on to search for user friendly Japanese Adjectives and Adverbs books.
2,Exercise book - not a handbook,This isn't really a handbook. It is a language practice book. The book is full of exercises throughout. It is aimed at advanced beginners or something like that.Only two stars due to what I consider an incomplete description of the book and because owning a book on adjectives/adverbs isn't really that important in my view. A good usage dictionary is more convenient
1,Horrible!,"The plastic bottle renders Sanford Higgins Calligraphy Ink totally useless for its intended purpose: calligraphy. The bottle is too lightweight, badly balanced and extremely prone to tipping over, and its rough, sharp mouth is no good for wiping the excess ink from your nib.A complete waste of money, plus it ruined a perfectly good pen. Unfortunately, it would cost more in transportation to return this bottle of ink than it cost to buy the horrid thing. I would give it TEN NEGATIVE stars if I could.Save your money and insist on calligraphy ink that comes in a proper GLASS bottle, such as Alvin, J. Herbin or Pelikan."
1,Very Basic,"I was disappointed. After reading the other reviews I expected something useful but this book is so basic it looked like the authors just threw together a few articles and basic web research. I would recommend this book only if you have no experience in business, have never taken a business course, nor read any other book on business ever."
3,Look close,"I was surprised to learn that the watch had no numerals, no second hand, and is difficult to reclose the band latch. It does appear to maintain correct time."
4,10 + years and still ticking .....,"I bought one of these about ten or twelve years ago (at least) and it's still working great - With some of the negative reviews I can only think maybe the quality went down somewhat . They do sell an in line timer ( I also have one of those and it still works great after about 8 years) or a bib end model if you want to buy any oscillating sprinkler bur still want the water saving features of this one. I originally bought these as backup's to my automatic sprinkler system in case it broke etc while I was deployed or on the road and couldn't fix it in a timely manner . I live in Fresno and between May & Sept if you don't water , everything dies when it's 95 to 105 degrees every day. I use the inline timer daily on my raised beds vegetable gardens ..just like the commercial ..set it and forget it !The oscillating sprinkler I use about 1-2 days a week so it's not in constant use , but it's sat out over winters and summers and still does what it's supposed to do .."
3,Best I have seen so far,"This review has been updated to reflect changes in opinion once I got to use the sprinkler for a longer period of time. Initially I wrote a pretty positive review and gave it 4 starts. I'm downgrading that to 3 stars and: I still think this sprinkler is good, but mine has started to have issues with the jets not spraying a smooth pattern. Also I have found the pattern adjustment design miserable to use and not very versatile. The ""turbo"" types have much better pattern adjustment, but they just don't last (put them up for winter so they don't freeze). All in all I'm going to try to find a different type of sprinkler to water my yard. If you really want an oscillating sprinkler of this type It appears the models at the home center store are similar (if you get the ones with the brass nozzles (the non turbo types)). This unit is an extra ten buck or so because it has a stop timer, that worked very well the few times I used it. just sort of bla, but it is rather cheap."
2,NS review,I am still reviewing this item. It has been functioning erratically. There was no guide or manual in the package.
5,The Big Country,"Montana is probably the last of the great frontier states that maintains a way of life that goes back generations. This incredibly compact volume will tell you and your students all about it and so much more.The ""Portrait of America"" series is a wonderful introduction for pre-teens to the 50 states and to the places and events that shaped the history of the United States. This ""Montana"" installment is particularly good. The book is broken down into sections like ""History"", ""Culture"", ""Economy"" etc., and each section is thoughtfully written and edited. And this edition is loaded with several beautiful photographs. The ""Culture"" section is my personal favorite.This book, as well as the entire ""Portrait of America"" series, will prove to be a valuable teaching tool to all primary school educators."
3,"Not that great, to me","I LOVE AMEL. I have purchased all of her albums with no regret. However, I'm not too fond of this one. Don't get me wrong, I love the jazzy atmosphere of the album. But Amel shouldn't be soooo... ""breathless!"" (for lack of a better word). Some songs the music flows nicely, but the harmonies and scats (or whatever it is that she's attempting to do) just don't flow. It's a total mismatch, in my opinion. I've listened to this album 2 times and I'm a bit disappointed that it isn't the album that I had expected. It hasn't really ""grabbed"" me just yet. I'll continue to listen and might update my rating, but for now it remains. I'll give her an E for effort, though."
3,missing something,"Amel is a great vocalist and I have all of her albums going back to when she was with groove theory. Lovely standards is an attempt of amel to do a full jazz cd. The cd is ok at best. A lot of the tracks sound the same and I don't really care for the way she delivers the vocals on some songs. I gave the album three stars because amel has a beautiful voice, I just don't care for the way the lyrics are delivered. If it weren't for her melodic voice i would've rated the album lower. Younger than springtime is a good song that has some good vocals and actually the track sounds slightly different than the majority of the album. This album can be relaxing but is caught somewhere between candle lit dinner music and elevator music. My final thoughts are, if you missed this album it won't be a big loss."
2,Disappointing at best,"After a couple of soulful and enjoyable albums, on this one Amel Larrieux sounds as if she's channeling Rickie Lee Jones. This music doesn't fit the delivery stylings found here. This is not a CD I'll listen to often. If this is a new path for this vocalist, she'll be traveling it with few companions, I predict."
2,Not quite a jazz vocalist...,"I have really enjoyed Amel's previous work and was gladly anticipating a jazzy album when I realized she was singing standards. Unfortunately, I found that the album was extremely slow and that the enunciation was a tad off. I had to pay close attention just to figure out what she was saying. Overall, I love a great jazz vocalist. Sadly, this CD did not fit the bill."
2,Not Feeling it at all :-(,"I was really looking for a nice Jazz Cd b/c I'm trying to expand my musical tastes a bit. When I heard Amel was doing a Jazz CD I thought I'd run out and get it b/c I absolutely love her. I have to say if this is what Jazz is all about then I think I'll stick with neo-soul. I've listened to the CD twice now and I'm not feeling it even tho I've tried. I'll give it another listen, hey maybe the third time is the charm."
4,I love This CD,"I predicted Amel would recieve Flac because she was releasing a CD of standards, well I was sceptical too, until I bought it today. I put it on and played it once, doing things around the house. Certain songs stood out more than others, but I by no means think this is a bad move for Amel. She glides effortlessly thru these songs, and some are not easy to sing either. What caught me by surprise is the Track #10 I like the sunrise, I had to play it several times because I could feel it was a pivotal song in the CD. Trust me my friends, this is not Bravebird cont. or Morning Pt.2 this is different and I like the chance she took. If you are a fan, take a chance and sample some of the songs. You'll like this collection. I already do."
5,SIMPLY A GREAT CD,"I STUMBLED UPON THIS CD WHILE LISTENING TO A JAZZ STATION. I'M NOT A BIG AMEL LARRIEUX FAN BUT ITS A GOOD CD, BERY RELAXING TO LISTEN TO WHEN YOU WANT TO JUST SIT BACK AND THINK ABOUT LIFE, SHE DEFINETLY WOULD BE A GREAT JAZZ ARTIST IF SHE GOES THIS ROUTE MUSICALLY..."
4,Something New,At first I found Amel's singing a bit raw and serious for my taste but with a few listening you realise that she has a very nice selection and different arrangements to certain songs heard a hundred times.A fine voice(can't wait for her next R&B; album) and you get a sense of pride listening to her as it feels like her heart is poured on to every track as she sings. Track number four is my favourite.
3,its great but...,after a while all the songs do sound the same. my favorites areYounger Than SpringtimeIf I Were a BellTry you WingsAnd then the rest sound like the same long song. I love Amel.. this was a great concept album but what is funny is that as a non tradition r/b souls artist.. she didnt take any risks.It did spark my interest in learning more about the originals though. She has a lovely voice and will surely have a long career! Id buy it again but in my ipod only those three songs get regular rotations...
1,WEAK,I am a fan of Amel Larrieux and her vocal style and had I thought a jazz album by her would be great. This album is not produced using any of the qualities of her past recordings. This is the weakest album she has ever done and do your self a favor pass it by. If you won't a jazz standards album by a contemporary singer check out Ricky Lee Jones (POP) it's true to her style.Patrick
4,Laudable Life Lore,"This is an excellent, workmanlike book dealing with issues familiar to all gay men (and there families).It is also an insightful resource to help recognize certain behaviors gay men can fall or play into and how to not just avoid those behaviors but to assert positive, self affirming actions to lead to happier and more fulfilling lives.Mr Kort has also made this an eminently readable, accessible and where appropriate, humorous presentation.I look forwrd to many more books."
2,Pop psychology for gay men,"Based on other positive reviews here on Amazon, I decided to buy this and Joe Kort's other '10 Smart Things' book. While this book was not as disappointing or unreadable as '10 Smart Things Gay Men Can Do to Find Real Love', it did have the same ultimate problem of being full of pop psychology and quite lacking in good, practical advice, despite the title and the impression I got from other reviews. If you see this book in a brick and mortar bookstore, the best thing you can do is jot down the ten headings on the back cover, which by themselves are indeed pretty good advice, then go home and decide for yourself how to go about them."
2,American Dream?,"The focus is to grow up, get a life and develop a long term relationship. The more I read the more I felt like I was being told I needed to get married, have kids and buy a house with a white picket fence. The echo of post WWII American dream kept coming to mind."
2,A bit redundant,"This seems to be a generally positive and well-intentioned book, covering aspects of life-improvement like ""taking charge of your life"" and ""understanding the stages of love"". However, I can't help but feel a certain redundancy in its self-congratulatory tone and focus. Of course gay men have the same right as anyone to improve their lives, but surely it can't be a high priority for them. How about some life-improvement ideas for morose and melancholy men? They are really the ones who need cheering up."
2,what kind of history do you want?,"Not a very exciting read. If you like to travel to France as I do, and just want to know something about the country and its past, this is not the book you want. If however you are a student who needs to know about various obscure historical figures, then perhaps it would be useful. The book does not present a good overall history of France, but does go into detail about selected events and people."
2,A weak history,This is really not a good book. It is a textbook style-feel book but it lacks depth and good illustrations.
3,in their final performance,Hi My name is Jeff I live in SEATTLE Poor Old is the greatest band ever. This Cd shows the energy of one of their show perfectly. Consider the fact I went to at leaste ten of their shows. Notice me on the front cover of this CD that's me on the far left corner. That show was very emotinal for me and everone. But they edited out some of the best stuff that they played that night that's why I only give the CD Three Stars. BELL BANG VILLA FOREVER That's the band first name.
5,"Have to Love ""Love That Bunch""","""Love That Bunch"" is an extraordinarily brilliant visual memoir of Baby Boom, L.I. culture. In some ways, perhaps only the Bunch got out of there alive. Her brilliantly funny depictions of family life, childhood, adolescent, and adult desire is a treasure. Few people are as funny and as honest as the Bunch when it comes to the body. Her depictions of her parents are beyond belief. The Bunch might not be able to go penstroke for penstroke on a techincal level with her husband, R. Crumb, but she is every bit his equal in terms of sensibility and storytelling. I've rarely laughed harder (a nervous laughter at times), than while reading The Bunch. Any man who loves a woman must buy this book--for his love and for himself."
3,It must be a mandate..,"That every anchor at Fox News write a book. E.D. as the ""priss"" of the station, wrote a pretty decent one here although I think she could better guide us on how to take care of 8 or 9 kids. I love her as an anchor, but I'm starting to get suspicious about all the book writing going on at Fox. Although a lingerie photo book would be a best seller if some of the female anchors pose. Overall, you won't be disappointed by this book, but I would say buy it used or check it out at the library."
1,The Best & the Brightest Republicans????,"George Bush. Yes, obviously the Best Prez ever. Asl NOLA residents.Pirro, ah yes. One of the brightest. Look for her look for her speech for an eternity announcing her bid to unseat Hilary.Thompson, who appeared in Pro Iraq War ads before it was launched.Those are 3 geniuses featured in this moron's book.I do love Dolly Parton, though. I am sure she's shivering at being in the same tome as these losers, written by a vapid neoconservative whore."
4,Fun and Insightful,"This is a great book to pick up to find out about one of your favorite people or simply to get a little inspiration. The group is diverse. This makes a great gift as well as a wonderful book to have by the nightstand for a quick read before bedtime. Amazon as well as E.D. Hill were wonderful to work with as far as delivery and getting the ""autographed"" copy.I highly recommend this one!"
5,Great Collection of Short Vignettes,"In her years on television E. D. Hill has talked to a large number of people in a wide variety of positions. It seems that she asked most of them to relate a story of how this person got started on the path that lead to eventual success.Each of the featured people just gets two or three pages to talk pretty much about whatever they wanted. Some talk about a favorite teacher. Some talk about a conversation that they had with someone, perhaps a parent, perhaps a working associate. Some talk about just watching other, already successful people.Each person has a different story, a different thing that affected them in some way. But while each of us is different, each person had some incident or person that influenced their life. It is to Ms. Hill's credit that she was able to get them to open up and record their thoughts."
2,blah,"Th plot is interesting and full of action--much like watching someone play a game of Halo, but with a lot of cut scenes. That's about what I expect from a video-game-inspired book. It's also not disappointing. What I did find disappointing, however, were the other similarities to watching someone play a video game. The author did not take advantage of the opportunity to add depth to the story. The characters, with a couple exceptions you'd expect from Halo: Combat Evolved, were generic and flat. Even worse, the author did not keep track of what people he'd sent off in opposite directions or what ships he had destroyed. In the opening chapters, he kept sending characters off to get supplies from a ship that had exploded in rather dramatic and plot-driving fashion."
5,This Book is Sweet!,Oh My Gosh This Book Is Sooooo Cool! You Will Read It Again I Promise. Its About A Space Station In The Future That Gets Attac By A Alen Life Called The Covinet. The Chief Second In Command Is Almost The Only One Left A Mystery Of Why The Covinet Attact! Read It Its a Great Twist At The End .
4,In between the game,"This is probably one of my favorite books of all time. This book may be long, but it is filled with tangible actions senses. This book has nothing to do with the game Halo 2. It is actual solve the questions that you ask in the game. It gives you a new perspective of the game. AT first is long because it has some random flashbacks giving you a depressing feeling. Later on you find the other survivor and his story. Also you will read how in the world the flood survived. This book has great detail and an intense fast pace story line."
5,Halo the best book ever,HAlo first strike is really good. Master cheif and solders are thinking on buinlding a machine (I can not tell what machine) and they get attacked by aliens! A lot of fighting master chief and jonhson plan attack. So you should read this book it has 36 chapter if you include the epilogue there are 37 chapters this is a really good book...but a lot of swearing (not really bad words).
4,Wow!,"This book doesn't read as well as his other Halo novel ""The Fall of Reach"" but it is very good nonetheless. This is a must read for Halo gamers."
5,One hit Wonder!,"As this was the first book I had read in the Halo series, at first I was convinced it was going to be another kiddy book with scary monsters(wait a second?)and final showdowns between the hero and the villain. It was the exact opposite. The book was great and after the first wary 50 pages I couldn't put the book down. The plot was great and I enjoyed the fighting scenes a lot. I felt it was a great sequel to the video game. I loved because it focused on the idea of the humans actually fighting back and also the section of the book where the exciting recon mission on Reach took place. Well Done Eric Nylund and Xbox on a fantastic book!"
5,Amon's halo first strike review,"I red this book 2 months ago and I love it. It has a good plot and it's especialy fun if you've played the game, because you can say ""I've killed hunters like that ""! It also really great if you want to know what halo 2 is like. I defenantely recomend it"
5,Carter Dapkus,"Awesome book and I enjoy reading it very much for it is great long and interesting book, it is just flawless, it's incredible"
4,A surprisingly good licensed novel,"Erik Nylund definitely surprised me with this one. The story goes from the seconds after the end of the first Halo and sets up the story for Halo 2. While this books is not as creative as The Fall of Reach, it's still a good story, and a fun, quick read.I read it when I was younger, and really enjoyed it. It manages to be solid Sci-Fi despite the licensing. I recommend it to Halo fans."
5,I absolutely love this book,"Let me start from the beginning, halo has been destroyed, whatever threat it held to sentiet life vanished. But the battle is not over as the master chief must find survivors, avoid covenant patrolling halo's wreckage, find a way bakc to earth and hit the covenant with a devastating first strike.There is much information in this book too much information, a risk for spoilers. Read this book and do it now. Thats all I can say."
4,Its good...just not the best,"The First Strike is spectacular in how it continues along the storyline from the end of halo, pitting the reader to the moment from leaving the halo ring and out into outer space. It journey's from there back to earth, making a great transition into halo 2. My only problem with it was that the writting, after close examination, was not as great as i originally thought it out to be. If i wrote this review after i read the book the first time, i would give it only praise and 5 stars. However, after reading it several times over and writing myself, i cannot say that the writing is phenominal. Well done, yes. But not special."
4,Action packed,"I enjoyed this title a lot... Action packed from start to finish. Fun read, would recommend to readers that like imagination..."
5,What a compilation of information!,"This book has been a wonderful resource for our history. It has pages of recommended books for each section of history studied. It is packed with many hands on activities for the sensory learner. Many ideas for map related learning, music, cooking ideas, drama, creative writing that corresponds with each civilization. It also includes a wonderful outline that parallels each age and is continuous throughout the book. We find it to be a great asset to our learning."
5,Tampons are Great.,"These tampons are really great and the box is very large, so it provides lots of protection at minimal cost!!!"
2,Ouch,"Tampax tampons have been the most uncomfortable tampons I've tried. Inserting them is hell, especially the cardboard ones. Plus, I'm a petite person, and I get frustrated with multipacks like these, because the largest tampon I can use is the regular size, so most of the tampons go to waste. If you're petite, definitely don't get these. If you're not, be sure to buy a whole bunch of lubricant to go with them. I used them for years, but didn't know what I was missing: plastic tampons! I recommend Kotex--much less of a pain, literally."
4,She's So High ROCKS. 'Nuff said.,She's So High is a really cool song. Tal has the sounds of Goo Goo Dolls and some other older musicians that I can't rightly place. The first time you hear his music - it's like you've listened to it forever.
4,This is a really good song!,If anybody has not heard of this song they should. This is a really good song by a really good artist.
2,Doesn't live up to hype,"I noticed the music to ""She's so High"" was somewhat catchy. But then I noticed the best lyrics this wannabe could come up with was ""she's so high, high above me. she's so lovely."" and he throws in ""like cleopatra, joan of arc, or aphrodite"" so he can make himself think he's smart. Then he makes that contrived music video, smiling and waving his pretty-boy face... I know nothing of his father's work, but I heard his father talked him out of studying philosophy and going into music... if this is the best kind of thought he can put into his music... he obviously hadn't gotten far in his studies."
5,gleeful,I heard She's So High on the radio and i thought it was a real neat song. I only hope he can continue the good work. p.s. i wish i could sing that high
2,Only part of the movie,"Anyone who already loves this movie and wants to own it will be disappointed. The dubbing is terrible. During the fight scenes, all you get are a few sound effects (that seem forced in to save face), but none of the original sound effects. In other words, during the fighting, no one yells, grunts, gasps, breaths heavily, growls or anything else to remind you that the volume on the television is still up. A huge disappointment to fans. Moreover, people seeing it for the first time will notice this irritating flaw as well, but maybe they won't mind so much. But then again, what's a martial arts movie without the trademark ""Haaiiiyyyy!!!!"" and what-have-yous when someone's kicking ass?"
1,Do Not Purchase,"I have both the Red Sun, and the Ground Zero versions. Both do the most terrible job of dubbing I've ever seen. I am a martial arts movie fanatic. Having over 500 movies. I have this one on VHS, but wanted it on DVD just to be able to skip around and watch all the fantastic fight scenes. In both versions, as soon as the fighting starts, all of the sound is removed and substituted by some cheesy typical punch kick sounds. This is itself is not bad. We're all used to that. The part that ruins the movie for me is that they simply delete all of the character personal sound effects. No shouting, no screaming, no anything. For me, this killed the movie. Especially since you can see they are saying something! I hope you do not make the same mistake I made, and purchase this movie."
3,DESPERATE SANITY?,"Since documentaries are featured as extras on many DVDs, there's a growing appetite for this cinematic art form. Criterion is feeding that craving with a series of fascinating glimpses into extraordinary real lives.The artistically apposite worlds of Jackson Pollock, and Robert Crumb are revealed in ""JACKSON POLLOCK: LOVE AND DEATH ON LONG ISLAND"" and ""THE CONFESSIONS OF ROBERT CRUMB"". Striking views of Pollock's work are commented on by artists including his wife, painter Lee Krasner. Ed Harris, the star and director of the Academy Award winning film ""Pollock"" discusses Pollock's blazing rise to fame and his difficulties coping with it.A sad look at the destructive, hyper life of a madman. Is being an artist, by definition, a kind of insanity?"
5,Awesome Calculator,"I have had three of these since 2004. These are great. Compact enough to put in your pocket and the buttons are big enough to use while wearing gloves. There is one design flaw and that is there is a small bit of wire going from the base to the top along the hinge. That is why I am on my 3rd one. The wire eventually gets worn thru and breaks. The calculator still works but will no longer work on battery power, only on the solar panel. Still giving this 5 stars even with this one problem. It is just hands down the best calculator I have used in my line of work."
1,If only I could give it NO STARS,"THIS CALCULATOR CAME WITH NO CHARGE AT ALL, THE BUTTONS SEEM VERY LOOSE AND ALTHOUGH I LEFT IT IN FRONT OF MY WINDOW FOR A WHOLE DAY IT STILL DID NOT CHARGE. WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT IF IT WORKED. COSTS THE SAME TO BUY A CALCULATOR AT TARGET OR BUY THE BATTERY FOR THIS CALCULATOR."
3,Great Compact Style,"This calculator is great, the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the keys are rubber and spread out just a bit too much. It makes punching numbers a little slower than I'm used to. Overall it's worth the price."
4,It's a calculator,"What do you expect? It does math and it folds. If you're reading a review for a standard calculator, you're putting too much thought into it. It's not a Texas Instrument, and it costs <$7. It's the sort of thing you add to cart to get the free shipping."
5,AWESOME TOOL,"This was a replacement after 5 years of heavy use. It has a number of pluses: 1) A cover that stays closed until you are ready to open it, 2) a larger screen, 3) bigger keys, 4) Decidely durable whether in pocket or purse. Prior to finding this calculator, I was replacing them about every 6 months. Out of a max of 5 stars, I give it a 6."
5,Big screen compact calculator,"This possibly is the best buy on the market. The calculator is compact in size. Will fit in your pocket, pocketbook, or briefcase with ease. The keys are a nice size and makes it easy to crunch numbers without making mistakes entering the numbers. The screen has a large display thats easy to read, all at a price that is hard to pass up. If you are looking for a compact pocket calculator this is the one to get."
1,Stopped working after 1 use,"I bought this for nursing school so I could throw it in my pocket and do easy calculations on it. It worked perfected the first day. I took it out a week later to use it again and the ""2"" button turned the calculator off. I tried to make it work but no luck. What good is a calculator when every time I hit the ""2"" button it turns it off??"
4,Great Calculator!,"This is a great calculator. The only reason for four stars and not five: This calculator does not have commas. Other than that that it is perfect. I do have another small calculator that was inexpensive that does have commas but that one has no battery, photon activated only. I was hoping to have the best of both worlds in this one but it was not to be."
5,Great non-annoying calculator for a great price!,"They always buy us these cheapo calculators at work that either break or that you have to hit with a sledgehammer to get the keys to work. This one showed up on my desk a month ago and is TERRIFIC, which pleasantly surprised me.The cover is extremely useful and appreciated because I hate things that get gunky and dusty like computer keyboards that never never get cleaned. The cover keeps this one grime-free and scratch-free. The screen is a nice large size and can be adjusted which is very handy, the keys are big and the math functions are in the 'right' places (the other day I borrowed a calculator that drove me nuts after an hour because the x sign was to the right of the plus and I had to keep looking to find it).Great calculator for great price!"
1,DOA,"Got this as a stocking stuffer for 4th grader since she's finally allowed to use a calculator occasionally at school. Quite disappointing to remove it from it's shell, press the on button and...nothing. Figure it maybe got shipped with a dead battery and it's dual powered (solar and battery) so took it under a lamp and...nothing. Quality assurance FAIL. Going to get one locally that we can test before we buy."
1,don't buy it,"I bought this calculator because it has a lid and I can carry it with me; the lid is nice. The problem is that the image is so weak that even in a brightly lit room, I can hardly see the numbers. It never works unless the solar panels are in full light so i have to go to a window to make it work. I've since bought a $2 one from a local store and it's much better."
5,"Lundberg Jubilee, Gourmet Blend of Whole Grain Brown Rice, 16-Ounce Units (Pack of 6)","In vain I have tried to introduce more brown rice into my diet and that of my family. Until now. We love this blend of brown rices! It has a natural sweetness and flavor that is better than any white rice we have tried! To cook it, I put it in my microwave (1 c. rice, 2 c. water) and press the rice button. When it is done, I push the rice button again. I ordered a pack of six and will soon need more. It is that good."
3,"Not bad for a first attempt, but...","When I first started this book I thought, ""great! A character somewhat like Travis McGee (I'm a big fan of the late John D. MacDonald's series) without it being a clone"", but as I read on I felt there was something missing. Maybe it's the way Matz introduces us to characters and then forgets about them after one scene; perhaps it's the way that Gavilan seems to be *too* much of an expert on too many different things, which strains credibility to the breaking point. And the ending is somewhat disappointing after the long buildup.At any rate, I wouldn't say *don't* read this book, although I definitely wouldn't put it on my list of favourites. Hopefully Marc Matz' next work will be just a little bit better."
2,Sorry I just had to mention....,"The way the author left pronouns off his sentences.... like... ""Went out the door"" Was insulting.... it didn't make it sound like the voice over on a 1940's detective movie... it made it sound like Mr. Matz needs an english class. It just came across as shoddy, not noirish."
4,Great album,The album is great. I did purchase this product second hand but the merchant did not thinks to make the thing look a little presentable. The case was damaged but at least the CD was ok.
3,Not as good as past CDs,"Good cd but not great.If you are new to Paul's work i highly recommend On The Horn, Undercover and Pleasure Seeker."
5,"If your eating depends on your selliing, read this book!","I love Jeffrey Gittomer.He gets what it is all about. For those of us who don't eat if we don't sell, here is a book worth reading.The advice is practical and will help you close more sales and take better care of customers. Is that not why we are here?You will not regret the time spent reading and rereading this book."
3,A Solid Effort!,"The outlook for selling as a career has darkened with the spread of automated and electronic transactions and product sales. How, then, can the modern salesperson succeed? By embracing a consultative sales approach, a salesperson can build one-to-one relationships with clients and become their expert resource for product information. Starting from shine-your-shoes-and-tuck-in-your-shirt basics, consultants Jeffrey Gitomer and Ron Zemke present a highly readable, detailed plan for managing every aspect of the transition from transactional to relationship-based selling. Beginning salespeople can use this book as a how-to guide for developing their careers, while seasoned professionals will gain from its straightforward instructions for developing a portfolio of long-term customers. Managers will relish the tools for cataloguing and improving their sales force's skills. For these reasons, we... recommend this book for sales professionals at every level."
3,The Mind of Jeffrey Gitomer Exposed,"This is one of Jeffrey Gitomer's earliest books and helps provide a window into the evolution of his thinking and writing. I read this years ago, set it aside, and only recently picked it up again. In truth, the insights are pretty much the same as in his later writings, if somewhat less entertainingly written. For anyone who is a true Gitomerphile -- as am I, this is a nice volume to add to your collection."
2,Knock your socks off disappointing,This book was disappointing. Zemke should stick to customer service. Gitomer is typically superficial. There are too many good books on selling to waste time with this one.
2,only works sometimes,"It looks good but it only works sometimes. It arrived in the right time, it just doesn't always work."
1,Didn't work,This item arrived but didn't work right in the package. The shipping cost more than the ring itself. I was however promptly refunded the full amount. I recommend finding this item in stores instead of ordering it.
1,terrible product and service,"terrible product and service.-difficult to light up. Goes off in a second.-looks very cheap, nothing like the picture- doesn't have multicolored lights. Only green.-came in later then initial estimated date, poorly packaged, crumbled.-the seller could not be reached.made a few attempts-nobody responded.don't waist your time and money."
3,Green Lantern Ring,"My son loved having the Green Lantern Ring. He said he couldn't be Green Lantern without it. From a parent perspective, the ring should have been made better because the battery doesn't always respond to being turned. It worked well the day before Halloween. It wouldn't come on at all on Halloween. And now it came on again today, the day after Halloween. A little frustrating."
4,Not for the faint of heart!,"Experimental electronica - no words, no melody, no beat, my mom would say it sounds like noise!"
4,Really good Bible!,"I'm a student at a Catholic School and we use the Catholic Youth Bible as our text book in Religion class. It's a good book that includes all the footnotes from the New American Bible. It has information on the various writers of each book, footnotes that make the Bible much more easy to understand and a section in the back with good pictures of holy places and things like that. The footnotes about different cultural religious beliefs are kind of stupid because they have little to do with Catholicism or the Bible. I reccomend it to children and adults who need a better understanding of the Bible from a Catholic point of view."
2,Catholic Youth Bible,"It stated it was in good conditon. There was doodling and writing all over the book, inside and out. Very messy. If this is good condition, I'd hate to see poor. My son was embarrassed to have to take it to his CCD class. Disappointed."
5,The Best Band You Never Heard!,"Mortal may be old news, but ther music continues to astound me. The album ""Fathom"" in my opinyon is by far the best. The music they have given us was 9 years ahead of its time. Im just now finding music that matches it."
5,Great,I love this show and i am so happy that i was able to order it with no problems and get it delivered fast
2,Exam retires in June 2001,The exam this book relates to retires in about 2 weeks from now and Oracle Corporation has not given an indication of what will succeed this exam.How relevant is the book if I can't use it for the specified exams?
5,Everything you need to know for OCP Financials exams,"This book covers every point in the OCP exams for Financials consultants. Lots of hands-on exercises, and lots of wise perspective from someone who obviously has done a lot of installations. Considering what the book contains, it's price is really low."
1,...,"I thought having different sprays of water would be terrific for around the yard. They are. I only wish it still worked. After using it for a total of four months, it no longer works. The trigger is permanently broken. It still squeezes, but no water caomes out. I hear ""things"" rattling inside the body. Obviously, they were improtant.My suggestion, buy something less complicated. It will work for longer."
3,summary of original sin,"In some ways one could use the word ""transmission"" instead of ""imputation"" for those who can't get their heads around the legal terminology common in Reformed theologians. This book attempts to examine how Adam's sin is credited to the entire human race, thus imputation. The book is dry and a lot of work to read. The theological concepts themselves are not so difficult to grasp as Murray's wooden prose. Unless you're willing to navigate hard-core Reformed theological writings in a stuffy mid-20th century academic style I'd recommend Henri Blocher's scholarly but far more readable Original Sin as a primer for Murray's ideas and for a thoughtful critique of some of their limitations."
4,A dark look into the mind of a gambler,"Don't read this book expecting to get close to entertaining re-creations of the 1919 Chicago White Sox players. The main focus is on the set-up man for the fix (who is also set up by a behind-the-scenes big money operator). ""Sport"" is a gambler and a dreamer -- but finds life sadly sapped of vitality without the thrill of risking what he is told to be important -- financial security, self-respect, even love. So why not the World Series? We follow Sport's narration through the thrills of seemingly arranging the biggest of gambling risks, but the road always seems to bend towards emotional letdown and emptiness. I thought this book would be more about players and owners, but must admit it was an interesting journey into the mind of an addicted gambler. A bit clumsily written in some sections, but very original in its focus and conclusions."
5,Fixed My Leaky Faucet,"The faucet outside my house is broken, and without having a shut-off attached it will leak constantly. For years I have suffered with using plastic models that cost about the same as this one, but just don't work very well.I've gone through several of the plastic variety, since they only function for about a year before they start to leak again. Also, it is extremely easy to cross-thread a plastic unit, especially when attaching it to older attachments with some wear.This brass valve seems to have solved all my problems, and should last a long time. The movement on the valve lever is easier than on the plastic models. I wrapped teflon tape around the threads before screwing it in, and I didn't have a single drip come out from any joint, despite my low expectations."
2,Lucid dreaming?,"Oh, please! I guess it depends on your idea of dreaming.If you enjoy dozing off with the electric blender on high, then you've gotta place this in your bedroom.Seriously -- the musicianship is highly competent, and there is an obvious commitment to the entire production. But this CD is not dreamy.The album title nails it: ""Rhythmic FISSION -- digital revisions of classic trax."""
1,Very Disappointed,"While the ""like new"" Jet Direct installed pretty easily and worked initially within days it failed completely and the vendor RASUL TECH has been ABSOLUTELY unresponsive to requests for a return or credit."
3,Stephen King On Line 1. . . .,"And he says - ""you've just stolen the plot for my novel Misery"". Really it's a big twist on the basis of Stephen King's Misery. But I love Paul Gross. Anything Paul does is absolutely perfect by nature. So there you have it."
4,Cold comfort is a very good movie,"Cold Comfort is a very good but dark movie. Rewarded as one of the best canadian movie, he is very pleasant to watch and the music with the atmoshere (very beautiful landscape) entertain people in this dark story between a poor salesman and a psychotic man with his daughter."
3,"O.k. movie, just not my type of movie",I will admit the only reason I rented this movie was to see Paul Gross. The acting was good. The movie seemed a bit long at times.What was good about COLD COMFORT? Paul Gross. What was bad about COLD COMFORT? the nudity and obsene language. Just not my type of movie.
3,I should go to one of these auctions.,"Plot description on this book's Amazon.com page. This story has a continuing plot that goes through the rest of the series, DYNASTIES: THE CONNELLYS. Good characters, story moves quickly and nice sexual tension between the characters."
1,A complete heap of junk - don't bother,This battery is a complete heap of junk. I would actually go so far as to say it is fraudulently being sold as a Nikon Replacement Battery which it clearly isn't. I bought this battery for my Nikon D90 and even after multiple charges all it shows when inserted in the camera is a flat battery sign. A voltmeter across the terminals shows it produces the correct voltage so I assume it is just lacking any of the intelligence and monitoring circuits of the authentic battery.Save yourself the trouble and do NOT purchase this junk and instead get a genuine battery so at least you will know it works.I just have to hope Amazon will take mine back seeing as I threw out the packaging - I naively assumed that it would just work.Utter junk and I think Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for selling such a dishonest and clearly defective product.
1,Battery is junk. Company doesn't stand behind it's warranty.,"I ordered this for my D90. Battery would not accept a charge fresh out of the package. Sent to the company under their ""warrany"" months ago and never received any reply. BEWARE!"
2,Needs a flow control,"With no way of controlling the amount of water coming out of the nozzle, you can not get enough pressure to chain them, which is what they advertised and why I bought it, so whats the point?"
2,difficult for me to use,"This sprinkler is difficult for me to figure out. Maybe it is just me, but when I want to cover more area and adjust the sprinkler, it goes the opposite way. So I factor that in for the next time, but it still seems to go the opposite way."
1,Melnor is not what used to be,"Terrible, simply terrible. Is amazing how low Melnor has fallen; they used to make good, solid produts, but this sprinkler has so many design/engineering flaws I don't know where to start.Stay away."
3,"Not bad, but don't chain them","If you're looking for a simple, cheap sprinkler, and you don't want to chain them together, then this one is fine.Some notes:1. Coverage is not especially even, unless you use the diffuser to interrupt the stream. It overwaters the outer edge of the path.2. Using the diffuser decreases the diameter of the coverage by about 50-70%3. In conditions of low water pressure (for example, when using this on one half of a Y connector, or in a chain with another sprinkler), there is not enough force for the sprinkler head to turn. This results in the sprinkler watering a single spot on the lawn, flooding it, because it's unable to rotate.All that said, if you just want a simple, cheap sprinkler, it isn't too bad. If you're willing to pay a little more, I suggest a craftsman rotary sprinkler with four nozzles (provides much more even coverage, rotates under low pressure conditions, but does cost about $29).Hope that helps."
4,OK so far,"This sprinkler seems to work well so far. The base is light, so I weight it with a brick or two. At least it has continued to work, which is more than I can say for any of the Gilmour sprinklers I have purchased."
2,You'll get sick of this one awfully fast!,"This was our 14 month old's first computer game. At first we were so excited to watch her learn to use the keyboard, and thought the games were cute. One month later we are SO sick of this game, and our daughter gets bored with the games very quickly. The software has bugs that cause loud static during some of the games. There is not much variety, or creativity to the game design or writing. Unfortunately this seems to be the case with most of the sesame workshop products (other than videos) that we have tried. Spend your money on something else."
3,decent but buggy,My 16mo son likes the keyboard games such as Peek a Boo. Most games are for slightly older children. It works OK but the MS keyboard button causes the program to halt when accidently pressed.
3,entertaining,"My 16 month old loves the keyboard interaction with some of the games. He'll need to grow into a few of the others. If you have a keyboard with the MS logo button it, for me, causes the program to stop working when the child presses it."
1,Double trouble,"This is the cream-of-the crop of being the worst kung-fu film in history. Since the Drunken Tai Chi master is the film that features Donnie Yen's first performance which is absolute garbage; there's nothing buy comedy throughout this abomination and the fight scenes look like they came out of a circus act. On the next DVD, you have a wannabe Bruce Lee which on the cover it says, ""Bruce Lee's aire"" and the actor is Bruce Li <(notice the last name spelling). So I'm warning all kung-fu fans: DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
4,Good selection of tracks,"I nice introduction of George Formby for me. You will end up humming these songs to yourself in a Lancashire accent. The CD is missing ""Imagine Me In The Maginot Line"", which is the song that I first heard about George Formby."
4,Loved it,"I loved the cover of this book........Everytime I needed visualization, I found myself flipping back to the cover to admire this wonderful couple I was reading about.(please read synopsis of the novel on the main page, other reviewers have done an excellent job at it already).I prefer a little more passion in my Romance novels, and although this book did not have enough of it in it, I still enjoyed it with all my heart.The storyline was simple, the details of the Genre an education, and the Dialect was correctly portrayed. You just find yourself wishing this well suited couple the best of luck for the rest of their lives.I have three other unread books by this same author in personal library and because if her writing style, I know what to expect and will read them as soon as I'm in the mood for some excellent very light romance reading."
4,very fine collection,"i was really into einstuerzende neubauten for years--and this collection gives the original german lyrics, as well as some decent (but not perfect) english translations, of their lyrics up to the mid-1990s. i would say the main flaw in this book is the serial interview with blixa bargeld--it's not very insightful. still, this is a must-have for diehard EN fans. too bad their recent work is so terrible!"
3,Rather Dull,"The other reviewer here said it best: just a white guy saying the same things we've always heard. As a feminist and post colonial cultural critic, I can't help but think this is the sort of book we *don't* need."
2,It's an ok banner,"From the pictures and description, I was expecting a little thicker fabric and better quality. This is just an ok banner for the price. I suggest paying a little more and getting something that will last. I would not call this a ""high quality"" banner, but If you are just looking for something inexpensive that you can use briefly, this is a good choice."
2,interrelationships in a closed society,I suppose unless you are a fan or studying EMF in particular these letters seem only of passing interest. If anything the interrelationships with others of note are interesting. Ray Monk's bio of Russell has many familiar players. This was a pretty closed society. Meanwhile I am reading Collingwood's autobiography which is very interesting.
5,A neat little book,"What better gift for a favorite uncle? The book is filled with funny stories, fascinating trivia, and warm tales of unclehood. I especially liked the author's interviews with children."
2,"all research, no charm","The book was written by cruising the web for anything and everything related to uncles. And that's it, just a list of trivial factoids about uncles. There is almost no original content here. I was hoping for an essay, or at least some good exerpts from literature, but instead I got synopses of TV characters. Some research-only books like Cod, are good. This one is pretty lame, definitely not worth it."
5,Cool music!,"An excellent album. The early albums were good, but this one is the best. They formed their own label to make this album, and it was a good move.The music is good, old-fashioned hard rock, and the lyrics are straight on to God. I'm looking forward more than ever to their next album."
2,Coo,"It definitely was not what I hoped for. The lyrics are okay, but I like them to be more biblical. I really only enjoyed about 3 or 4 songs."
1,A Shocker,"Definitely the worst movie viewed so-far this year.Agree entirely with all the former comments, only to add my own disgust with the production values.Shaky cameras obviously only included as it is a bit of a fad at present and split screens ugh! Much of Val Kilmers dialogue also very muffled when wearing an overcoat....Did this movie have an experienced Sound Team?A story that relies on almost throughout, the actors engaged in telephone conversations over and over again.I see ""Kilmer Films"" somewhere in the credits. Let's hope this fine actor keeps a much tighter lid on what the company does in the future.I have managed to tick one star above and that is for the image quality. The pictures and film transfer are very good....That's it and only it!"
1,1 star is over rating it.,"This movie was painful to watch. It was boring and stupid. Very low budget-but I guess Val Kilmer can't get work since ""Heat"". Could not even finish the movie. The idea of going back in forth in the movie to me was just a way to use up time. Terrible, Terrible Movie"
5,Exciting and Val Klimer is Awesome,"This is fantastic - Val Kilmer does one of his best acting, while the story and plot leave you guessing. Columbus Day is a must-see in my movie catalogue."
3,Not what you think it is.,Fairly good movie. Moves a bit slow at times. Some tender moments here and there between John and his daughter. Good movie to watch on a rainy day.
2,"2 stars,well i couldnt see the fights the dvd is garbage","Im not sure about the movie i dont think it was very good,what do i mean when i say i think it was no good.....I couldnt watch the film becouse the video was poor first off lets get this out of the way again.Dont buy fullscreen movies especially action movies, buy them as they were meant to be shown or your gonna miss some, in the case here we miss alot fights break out and you cant see them becouse the stupid pan and scan has got to pan over to catch the action in Kung Fu flix the fight could have already been over.People still holding on to that belief that fullscreen is better becouse no black lines and it fills your screen up,that might be true but you cant say you've seen the matrix untill you see it in widescreen becouse literally you havnt seen all the movie,you just watched a little over half even though you may have watched it to the end.So i guess im off topic with this movie but this is a prime example of awful video"
2,Not Shown as Pictured,"This product doesn't look like what the picture shows. It looks exactly the same as this other connector -- Orbit 58248 Brass Garden Hose Y Connector With Shut-Off Valves. [...]. I thought that I was getting a connector with brass valves, but they're actually plastic. And, the coupling nut is not entirely brass, either; it's also covered by plastic."
3,Item received not as pictured,"The item that I received is not the SOLID BRASS bodied item as pictured. I got a brass colored zinc alloy bodied wye with SOLID BRASS male threads and a SOLID BRASS plastic covered female end. Valves have plastic covered metal handles. Quality is good but not as good as pictured. Zinc alloy has a tendency to corrode in some environments. Not bad for the money, but I was deceived. When I sent an email to the seller about my concerns, I got NO response. I think they know what they are doing, as picture has not changed to actual item."
2,Not So Good,"What they do not tell you on the cover is that some of the tracks have been edited down in length. For ""I Was Only Joking"", that means that about thirty seconds of the nice acoustic guitar solo in the middle of the song were deleted. You get a few seconds of acoustic, then it goes right into the electric lead (I thought my CD player had skipped when I first heard it). It's not even a good edit. On Maggie May, the acoustic prelude is omitted, and the fade at the end comes about 15 seconds sooner than the original. I did not bother to listen to the rest to see what else is missing. I returned it as ""defective"" in that the contents are incomplete."
2,Hard to read,While I thought this book was great with the extra research and info done on the Master Key System... the font's and typography is horrible. It's very hard to read and some pages were completely faded. Basically it is just a bunch of copied text reprinted. I would have loved to see this information rewritten not just scanned and copied.
4,I had higher expectations,"I've read several of Haanel's books and this one certainly doesn't fit the same mold. I've loved his work and the wisdom and strength one can get from his writings is amazing. That being said, I would not recommend this book by itself and would refer you to read his other books first. I rated it 4 stars for it's content but as for being useful for your hard earned money, I'd look elsewhere. The book consists of a mashed up collection of essays that are sporatically useful but again, for my money I would not recommend a new reader of Charles Haanel."
5,Terry's best record yet!,"I really love Terry's latest record, John Wayne. It's full of the brilliant insecurity that he's known for--I feel right at home listening to it. I'm a lyric person myself and have always admired the way he brings out the mystical in normal life. His records are like a musical version of Annie Lamott's books, from a guy's perspective.The Brian Wilson-meets-The Beatles production is top notch. ...a lot of neat vocal and guitar things are going on here. Give this record a listen and you won't be sorry."
4,Great for First Timers! Very smooth,"These have to be the best. I am a novice user but I have tried slim plastic by Playtex and Compak. These are slimmer than the Compak and as easy to use as the plastic. They are flushable, which is great and they never leak. My only problem is that the cover is not as strong (but also flushable) and I wish that there were more lites.There is another multi pack available that has more lites and slender regulars but Amazon does not carry it. Just buy a case (Radius or Vinnies Tampon case) to keep them protected. These are the way to go! Incredible comfort!!"
3,Make sure your control plate fits,"This switch does work, but you should look before you leap. The switch travel is greater than it is for a standard 3-way switch, and if you use the common Fender replacement control plate (or one that was only intended for a 3-way switch, it may not fit. You could fairly easily alter the plate, but if you want the cleanest look possible you may want to investigate a new control plate."
4,Product was fine.,"The switch works as expected, was packaged decently.Unfortunately, I think the mod (bridge + neck in series) sounds way too muddy and strips the tele's sound of everything that makes it a tele (that sparkle and clarity), but that's a matter of taste and not related to the quality of the product."
1,Find Something Better,"I purchased this item hoping for an updated, and therefore XP-compatible, version of Midisoft's old recording studio program that I used to play around with many years ago. This is not that. This program, which I purchased in 2008, works just fine on a modern system, but it appears to be about 15 years old. It is clunky, awkward, and frustrating to use. Even if you have to pay a little more, there are much better products than this."
1,"Heavy on the Style, Skimpy on the Substance","This book is the perfect illustration of Ronald Reagan. Give the people lots of pretty pictures to look at and keep them distracted from the deficiency of intelligent thought. Heavy on style yet skimpy on substance. If you want to celebrate the shallowness that was Ronald Reagan, then this is a good book for you."
2,What a poor DVD,"The only thing good about this DVD is the Shaolin One documentary, but that was made back in the early 90's (evident as when it said Kids from Shaolin was Jet Li's latest movie). Still, it has some great martial arts footage of masters of many styles. The movie Brutal Boxer is a real let-down. The dubbing is low volume compared to the rest of the movie and the 70's gang fight thing just doesn't interest me at all. Jackie Chan is in this film, but it's just a gang member that never gets any real camera. The film is just an excuse to have one-on-many gang fights which are so messy you can't tell who is who. And once you see the first fight the rest are the same. What a stinker! I hated it. I had to stop 1/4 way into the movie."
1,No Sound Under Windows XP and No Fix,Encore claims that the software was written prior to Windows XP yet the software was released as a new title well after Windows XP was available. If you visit the company website they only apologize but do not offer a fix.
2,"Great Activities, Poor Usability","I love the activities, but the poor usability makes it agonizing to play. Transitions, humor sequences, explanations, etc. are all very long (30-60 seconds), and you can't click through them. You don't even get a cursor until the sequence is done, and you can't Esc to exit the game. A minute is a very long time to go between clicks!"
1,"Yeah, no sound for me too","The software is pretty much useless if you got XP at home. Since there is no sound nor manual, the only way your kid learns how to play is from the speech."
1,Major Problem with Right Turn,"From the first day I encountered a major problem. Once the car makes right turn from going straight, the car immediately stops and won't move until I manually turn the front wheel to the left. Whenever the wheel move to the extreme right, it stucks and won't move back. I thought this problem might disappear if I disassemble it and assemble it again. But, the problem persisted. The car can go straight and make left turn, but unable to make right turn is not so useful. I wish someone can provide me a solution for this problem.The other problem was that the battery pack only last for 30 min. operation. This seems too short."
5,Durable Car!,"I got this car 4 years ago as a gift, and it still works. Just this past month I drove it off my roof (15 ft) and jumped it off a large bank (15 ft), where it landed on its back, then I drove it away. I also, about a year ago, drove it into the ocean about 2 ft under, and drove it back out. It still works! Though the price used to be under 200, this cars price is accurate for the durability it delivers."
4,Very good car but the battery is not what expected,"Very good and durable car for the little ones, but the battery duration is not what we expected, it only lasts about 30-40 minutes."
5,Great 14th Birthday Gift,My grandson asked for this for his 14th BD. He had it put together and working in no time at all.It will run 14mph and looks massive. He is very pleased with this car kit. Nate loves to work with his hands so this was the perfect gift for him. He wanted a remote control car costing more than twice as much but when I suggested something he could put together his self he found this online and loves it. Received order in just 2 days.
2,Hotter than a Mexican's lunch!,"This CD features the soundtracks for three of Russ Meyer's films from the 1970s. Unfortunately, the recording quality is rather poor. The tracks seem to have been recorded directly from the films. So, you don't hear just the music from the soundtrack, you hear the dialogue and sound effects. This can be pretty annoying, although some of the dialogue is amusing. But at least the CD includes a booklet featuring nice photos of the films' naked, bosomy women."
1,Poor design -sent it back,"These gaiters had a top opening so skinny it wouldn't fit over a kid's bare leg, much less an adult with pants on. No way could I use them. I sent them back and got a different brand I can actually use."
3,Fits great but does not come with everything,"Mine came from National Auto Parts.PROS-- Fit my 1998 Nissan Altima nicely. Once I attached it and plugged it in I was able to use the dashboard controls to adjust the mirror.CONS-- Although it does come with bolts, it does not come with nuts. Luckily I still had the old ones.-- Does not come with the plastic inside panel. Not a deal-breaker, but if you don't have the old panel it means the electrical wires will be exposed inside the car.-- Black color does not match rest of car or other mirror."
5,Very New,"Batteries,accessories and disks still hard to find. Product works well. Disk and card option neat for quick computer interface. Simple controls, PHd not rquired. Pricey but seems to have the bells to be worth it. Small DVD's a plus. Fast recording speed. No negatives."
3,Telephoto adapter and telephoto lens...,do not fit correctly. I am disapoointed with that part of the product - rest of kit seems fine.
3,"great boot, but they don't exist anymore","I had these boots for 5 years and one day while hiking in them, the front of the sole came off and peeled back about halfway up. In addition, the grey mid part of the boot started to crumble a few weeks prior. They were great boots while they lasted. The leather got wet pretty easily, but didn't let in too much water. I was trying to see if I could buy another pair, but too my disappointment, Dunham or New Balance now no longer makes any hiking boots whatsoever. These were classic looking boots that were super comfortable and lightweight. I got them on clearance from Ramsey outdoor 5 years ago, but if I had known they weren't going to make them anymore, I would have gotten the 2 other pairs they had left. Although, I think they should have lasted longer than they did considering I wore them probably all together for 2 years if you were to string the usage time together."
1,Buyer Beware,"Buyer Beware. This is NOT a Soundtrack of the music from ""Impromptu."" This CD contains music 'inspired' (the word used on the front page of the CD) by the film. The music is performed by Edith Hirshtal and Ick Choo Moon. The performances are ok, but are NOT the performances from the film which are by Emmanual Ax and other more prominently renowned artists."
5,Not what you think!,"I LOVE this game!!! When it first starts, you think -- oh no, not a BABY TYPE GAME! Then you start to play...It becomes very addictive. I bought this game not too long ago and I can't put it down! I'm always trying to beat the computer! It has excellent graphics and moves through the game smoothly. It has 4 different ""lands"" you can go to or you can go through all 4 ""lands"" like a marathon. I find this game even more addictive than the original Tetris! Sure, most of it it set up like a board game--but then you realize that you are acting as one with your M&M and trying to beat the other(s). I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!"
3,M&M REVIEW,THIS GAME IS PRETTY COOL IF YOU ARE AN M&M FAN OR YOU LIKE BOARD GAMES.OTHERWISE YOU PROBABLY WOULDNT ENJOY IT SO DONT SPEND YOUR MONEY.IT CAN KEEP YOU BUSY FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT YOU GETTING BORED OF IT. IT LOOKS LIKE A KID GAME BUT ITS NOT TOO EASY.THERE ARE MANY MINI GAMES SOME OF THEM ARE FUN SOME ARE STUPID.I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS GAME.ITS NOT TOO EXPENSIVE AND THE M&MS ARE VERY COLORFUL AND VIVID.THERE ARE MANY THINGS TO DO AND CHOOSE FROM UNLIKE MOST GAMES WHICH ONLY FEATURE ONE GAME TO GO THROUGH.:}~
2,No fun,I purchased this game for my 11 yr. old son. I think he was bored with it. He played it once and traded it for something else.
5,A Practical Tool for Practioners and Staff,"The Total Service Medical Practice is a practical, easy- to-use roadmap for keeping focused on the customer! Definitely not just a book on theory, but a manual chocked-full of concrete examples on how to mobilize your team around identifying and enhancing the critical 'moments of truth' for your medical practice. Dr. Bradford provides us with numerous tools and take-aways from her experiences in the industry - a great read for providers, practice managers, and office staff."
3,Addition to Amazon data,"The performer for this recording is Geert D'Hollander (a personal friend of mine, and currently carillonneur at The University of California, Berkeley)"
4,"Great for beginners, but that's all","When I picked this book up, I didn't know much HTML, it teaches in a good manner, not trying to overload you with to much at one time. Mr. Oliver does a good job of keeping you laughing through out the book. Also, the section on Gif animator was great. Though....this book will teach you the very basics of HTML, no more. You will have to go out and get more advanced books and start to learn how tables can postion graphics and text extremely well etc... But for the beginner, you can't go wrong."
5,Great book; good sense of humor !!!,I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book; I found it very useful and Dick's humor was quite 'a-propos'. I strongly recommend it to ANYONE who wants to learn about creating web pages.
4,Everything you need to jump start in web publishing!,A concise and easy-to-read compilation for starters. Eliminates your fear and apprehension about web publishing in just couple of hours!
4,Beautiful!,"It deserves five stars,but I never give five stars to any books.(Sorry, it is my rule.) This book is,not too thin, not too heavy,written in plain english, good for beginner of course,especially good for idle man like me. Yes,the books like ""sams teach your in 21 days"" series are good but those books are too heavy for me.But this book has a proper volume. and search other 'in 24 hours' series for more web publishing."
5,Heaven 17 for HTML Beginners,Excellent guide to HTML starting from the very basics. Easy to understand format for those curious enough to take the first steps into writing their own web page. Text is easily understandable and examples given are clear. A must for those wanting to learn HTML
3,OK could do better,"As a whole it's not a bad book for an area that can get quite complex, but it really ticks me off that all reference's to the accompanying online site give the same URL, which is a pain when there are many sub pages that you would like to go directly to. Maybe as a whole a little too basic."
5,Move Beyond Web Building Software,I started creating web pages over a year ago with a web building software package. It seemed great until I wanted to expand my page and add new things. The software made it frustrating so I looked into HTML books and bought Sams Teach Yourself HTML4 in 24 hours. Now I am creating 99% of my webpages in HTML code that I write myself (No special software needed)and have total control on what I see and where it is placed. I am about to take an Advanced Web Page Course for a certificate and Sams Teach Yourself HTML4 covers everything needed for this ... course and more! This book is a must for anyone who wants to learn HTML who has No Experience with HTML and Web Design to start with!
3,A good information Book,"I just got the book , and learned quite a bit of useful information, However, many of the links to information in the book do not work or are out dated, There is also a link to direct help form that you can go to and ask for help, but they dont have the time to help you. I feel that the general content of the book is very helpful, But the content could be much more informative and direct."
2,Even beginner would find this book waste of time,"the book generally aims at ""beginners"" who would probably have no experience in HTML 4. it would be, however, a total trash for anyone who has some HTML experience. the book doesn't explain too much about the different coding ways in using netscape and internet explorer. the ""form"" part has been poorly written. if you just want to learn some HTML basic skills, ok, you can borrow this book from your local library and then return it asap. don't waste money buying this book. the reason why i gave this book 2 stars is that it has a reference session by the end of the book. other than that, this is a minus one star book."
1,Don't waste time and money!,Publisher and authors don't support this book. You can't find samples and web links don't work.
3,Dont buy it but rent it,"This movie was very boring until the last fight scene. Which is why I gave it 3 stars. The final fight scene alone I think was worth the purchase, but I think you should rent it first and decide yourself. The last fight lasts about 15 min and is great because the fighters anounce their styles. They use cobra style, tiger style, tiger claw style, panther style ,rattle snake style and various other styles. Some styles even have a sound of that respective animal. Like when he uses the panther style, you can hear panthers roar. The final fight scene also includes a lot of trash talking which I like. Video was crappy. Some frames were either all black..or all green. I recommend you rent this movie, and fast forward to last fight."
3,"old ""skool"" kung Fu","This movie deserve a 3 star Just for the last fight scene. I've seen better fights using the same kung fu styles. I though most parts of this movie was boaring, leading up to the ending,,,not to mentioned the remarkably poor picture and sound quality. I had to force myself to sit through the entire cinematography of this flick,,,,,,,,,needless to say,,the final scene,,sort of compensate. Definatly worth checking out!!"
1,Does NOT Run on Windows 2000,"Despite the packaging, this software (and unfortunately, many other toddler-level programs) does not run on Windows 2000 with SP4 installed. Encore states as much if you inquire, but no such caveat exists on the package or in any marketing materials. The result is no sound after the opening credits. Removing SP4 is a non-option in today's computing environment, so this software is effectively useless. I do not understand the design philosophy that targets toddle-level software to 9x systems. These are obsolete and far less stable platforms, especially with a 2 year old banging away on them. Even at this modest price point, 2000/XP compatable should now be the standard."
1,Disappointed,My daughter received this as a gift. When we went to play the game the 1st time it did not work. We had to return the 1st cd and wait for a second to be sent to us. When we received the 2nd cd it worked better but still not like other games we have. It is sluggish and skips parts. I had higher expectations of this product - for instance that it would work. We were only able to play it once. The other times we attempted to play the game it would freeze up my computer before we even got through the introduction.
1,Save Your Money,"My two-year-old son really enjoyed the Sesame Street Infant software. I figured the Toddler software would also be a big hit. I was very wrong. First of all, his name was pronounced wrong, but he thought that was very funny. The program is very slow to respond. One of the games doesn't work. I get a CD error message. It's clearly not what I expected. I think Encore tried to put too many bells and whistles into this program and lost focus. There's no flow, the games are too easy and they take too much time too process. My two-year-old doesn't have the patience to wait for the items to download. We'll stick to the games on the Sesame Street website from now on."
2,Sesame Street Toddler,"I did not find this game to be as educationally sound as I would expect from Sesame street. There is too much talking before the program will react to a command. The graphics are jerky and the cursor acts like the target is magnetically charged and keeps pushing away the cursor. When the child actually does manage to click on a target, the cursor may still fly to another target and the child is told that his answer is wrong. Another example of educational problems is the pronunciation of ""eggs"" using a long ""a"" sound instead of a short ""e."" This is not very helpful in teaching a child the sound for short ""e."" Children that are used to playing computer games by themselves may find that this game is too frustrating to do alone. The open ended learning curve is a great idea. I just wish Sesame Street would hire a truly qualified literacy expert to help clean up the many problems in this program."
3,mixed good & bad,"The art cd in this pack is great. You can paint, do stickers, and costumes--all fun and creative. The numbers & letters games are horrible. Essentially the child is wandering around on Sesame street and gets to make a bunch of stuff repeatedly move by clicking on it. There aren't really any games or play of any value embedded in this aimless & boring wandering. Worse, there is a tv in every home the child visists (Big Bird, the Count, etc) & this tv is the main attraction--my son would go to the room (in the game) and ask to watch tv. Just what I needed. Somehow I disabled the video compont so now all the tvs are broken--this helped some, but I was disappointed in Sesame Street enough to get on here and wirte my first review!"
5,Love it! Well-suited for my growing toddler,This is a must-have program. Better material than the Disney Learning Toddler which is still good. My toddler loves it and finds new things about it as her learning interests change. We discover new screens every once in a while too. The name feature is very cool.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE!!!!,"Even though my product came in packaging that said that it worked with Win2000 sp4, it does not. The sound does not work after the opening credits.I am very unhappy with this software distributor. They have conflicting information on their support FAQ that says that it won't work with Win2000 sp4, yet the box says otherwise."
1,Really bad A/V quality,"I'm not a documentary collector.This is the worst concert recording that I have ever seen. I even thought I got a vcd for this.The video and audio quality is far way below you expected and I can't even ""enjoy"" this for 2 minutes longer."
3,It works ..,"For my kitty, nothing special .. super thin plastic, but he doesn't knock it over .. wouldn't pay more then a couple dollars for this .."
2,A disappointing book,For one of the most photograhed woman of the twentieth century it is amazing that with each new book that is published that the photo's used to illustrate it are generally one's that have been used often in the past...this book is no exception...very few unseen or different photo's here..and as usual the content is sadly unbalanced..the book is 120 pages long...86 of those pages refer to the years up until 1963..the last 30 years of her life...which wre just as interesting are dismissed with a scant 34 pages.Aristotle Onassis makes one appearance and Maurice Templeman who shared more of her life than any other man doesn't get a look in...all in all a very disappointing pictorial look at this facinating woman's life.
2,"Disappointing - 1 Solid Chapter, 2 pretty good ones, and 9 Chapters of Filler","First, let me say that I'm a pretty big fan of Les Edgarton'sHooked: Write Fiction That Grabs Readers at Page One & Never Lets Them Goand I was ardently hoping that this book would be just as solid and useful as the first book of his that I had read. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. Finding Your Voice had 5 Chapters of stalling and padding, a few solid chapters on voice, and then another bunch of filler. Take a look at the Table of Contents and you'll see what I mean. This book wasn't worth the asking price, let alone the time to read it.Now there aren't many books dedicated solely to ""voice,"" but there are a few that have a few chapters on it with material that is more than the equal of this book's. So here's what I'd recommend you buy instead:Movies in the Mind, How to Build a Short StoryandThe New Strategy of Style"
2,Common Sense,Save your money: Just do a quick web search for finding your voice in writing - any quick list on the subject will contain the same advice found in this book. The book delivers the most basic information and repeats it endlessly.I also found the author to be annoying. That is a matter of personal opinion but I strongly recommend reading a few excerpts to get a feel for *his* voice before you try to read the whole book.
5,A variety of great talent,"What a fine album, plenty of guest stars here but it is McPartland's steady, graceful, and understated piano playing which is the backbone of this album.Many live albums suffer from bad production, this one doesn't. It captures the live feel, without overdoing the applause.Marian's duet with Norah Jones on ""The Nearness of You"" might be worth the entire price of this album. It is spine-tingling good and makes one wonder why Jones is singing that average poppy music instead of venturing more into traditional jazz. She aces this tune in a big way.The rest of it is great, too. Lots of fun, makes one wish they were at this grand celebration to honor a jazz master."
2,"Bad writing, Bad Diagrams, No Background Information","I agree with the second reviewer. The writing style is that of hukstar snake oil health food advertisement. It is also explains things poorly. The diagrams are labeled with handwritten notes making them hard to read. The diagrams don't match the descriptions. Hardly any background information is given to ""why"" you are doing one thing as opposed to another. The directions suck. You don't have an easy sense of knowing what you are doing"
1,Acupuncture without Needles,This book is very poorly illustrated. The author seems more interested in showing details of the person's hairstyle and clothing than clearly showing where the pressure points are. In some cases there is no pressure point indicated although the name of the point is given. I would not recommend this book to anyone seeking to become proficient in acupressure.
2,"Might have some good information, but very dated","The good thing about this book is the abundance of very detailed illustrations to help you locate the pressure points. But the style is very, very goofy and dated. The text is written in a breathless style that brings the word ""huckster"" to mind. It is full of all kinds of far-fetched claims about the wonders of ""Acupressure USA!"" and supposed case histories of stars that are too big to name, and at least one ridiculous profile of a successful lady ad exec who knocks out skeptical clients with her ""huge breasts, long legs and peaches-and-cream complexion"". There are also lots of exclamation marks! Then there's the illustration of acupressure techniques to increase your breast size -- ha, ha! Acupressure is a useful technique, but there's too much hype in this book to take it seriously."
1,Myscene interview,"I am 9 but I don't like my dolls.They are getting to trashy, and to boy kissy.i do not approve.This is what i really feel.The dolls are not durable even though I play with them gentley."
1,Yeah...,"Um.. you below, just clarifying that the kid below you was saying that people that don't like My Scene are putting ONE star for their reviews(kinda like what I'm doing now-sorry-) not five stars and she is saying that that isn't fair because it lowers the overall rating and makes the product look bad to other customers... Yes just clearing that up. Oh, and also give the nine year old a break! She doesn't approve of the dolls cuz she thinks that they're too kissy. Hey, my nine year old sister would think the same thing. So anyway, I don't like My Scene but you guyz do so I'll respect that.(Oh, and you spelled BEAUTIFUL and OBVIOUSLY wrong)That is all >^,,^<"
1,"Yeah, This is REAL Cool.....","Note to all of you reading this, my title is being sarcastic. I wouldn't take this unless somebody held a gun to my head. The boy doll (River) is okay although he should loose those dorky shorts. But Barbie looks like Christina Aguilera on crack! She looks like she's looking off into nowhere or like she's spaced out or something."
2,A Regular Album,"""Accept the Signal"" is a combination of dark, edgy and futuristic music, containing songs that play by their own rules and don`t stick to a particular formula. This experiment is somewhat interesting and worthwhile at parts, but fails to deliver a consistent, engaging recors. Some songs are good achievements, like the witty single ""King Kong"" or the subtle ""Girls"", even if the album is uneven and flawed. Those who like the Stone Roses, Primal Scream or Death in Vegas may give this one a try. A competent, though not terribly exciting effort."
2,seems i'm the only one who doesn't really like this...,"I can't stand this EP. Seriously. Zao is one of my favorite bands, and their output on this disc is so-so. On it we've got the original ""Skin Like Winter"", which is full of energy but the production is sloppy. I prefer the version on Liberate te ex Inferis. Zao's ""Walk on by, Walk on Me"" is awesome, and I have no complaints about this track. Now - Training for Utopia, what a horrible band. They pretty much ruined the split. Chaotic my ass. TFU sounds like a crappy nu-metal band. I understand some dudes from TFU are now in Demon Hunter, who are crappy nu-metal as well.2 stars for a mediocre Zao track and a great Zao track."
5,Bigger than I expected and my son loves it!!!!,This Spongebob pillow is awesome. It's very large which makes it a great pillow. But best of all my 2 and half year old loves Spongebob so this pillow is also a pal. Buy it as it's worth the smiles.
5,Perfect!,"I have owned a set of this memory for over a year (paid 4x the current price), just ordered another set to take myself to 4GB. This is great RAM, I felt the need to write a review to bump up the average rating since it was rated 1 star by someone who didn't check to see what memory they should buy for the MB they have."
2,worthless,I have a bedroom upstairs where the sun shines all day. The film blocks some sun but it still gets hotter than hell in that room
4,The best decision-making book I've read,"I thought this was the best decision-making book I've read. It had some good observations about the decision-making process that I have not found in other books. These include the decoy decision; asking what you would do in a perfect-world scenario; and separating facts, needs, and wants. The book is written in a very readable way and is geared to personal decisions. My only criticism is maybe the book could have talked more about how emotions such as fear or anxiety can lead to irrational decisions. But overall, a great book"
5,Top Rated!,"In researching wrist monitors, I discoverd that this model was the top rated in international testing. Search on ""German Hypertension League Testing"" and you can find the report. The WS-820 was the top performer, even beating out arm monitors.I found the unit works really well and is quite fast. My readings usually take about 45 - 60 seconds. Its really easy to use and I take it with me when I travel. I also like the two memories. I use them to keep my morning and evening readings seperately."
4,Getting the job done.,"The Prevention blood pressure monitor gets the job done. It seems to produce fairly reliable results and does its job in a reasonable amount of time. Still, I would prefer a monitor whose face mounted on the upper part of the wrist rather than the underside. It feels a little awkward sometimes. I also wish it worked a little faster too. Still, it has a very large face and anyone can read the results without having a hint of a problem. That being said, I find it to be more than acceptable, yet I wish it were a tad smaller, a bit comfortable and a little quicker with the results."
5,Prevention WS-820PV Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor,Very accurate. We checked it against our family doctors office readings and we trust it completely. Well made and easy to use.
1,Should have listened,Wrist monitors are not accurate. I have confirmed this by testing it side by side with arm cuffs. I am sad I wasted my money.
4,Great,You would not be disappointed in this blood pressure cuff. It works great for my husband and I. You can both keep your blood pressure log so easy without having to write it down. Very easy .
4,Nice unit,"Easy to use. Quality construction. The position of the device on the wrist and relative to the heart is critical. Once the proper positioning is established and used consistently, this unit performs well."
2,Cheesy,"I bought this game for myself. I have hoyle board games and casino, which I liked. However, when compared to other slot games I have for my PC, Hoyle doesn't even come close to matching their quality. Save your money. Reel Deal slots versions one and two are leaps and bounds ahead of Hoyle slots. Hoyle needs to pay a little less attention on the face maker abilities of the game and more on the gaming part. I was highly disappointed after paying $19 for this game. Cool for beginners, but if you have ever been to a casino, or played other casio slot games, you will be disappointed."
5,good/clean movie,I thought it was a good movie and shows what one couple can do to reach out to boys who have gotten in trouble and need to be steered in the right direction. They need love and for someone to show an interest in them. I really enjoyed the movie. It is a good clean movie and would not have to worry about sharing this movie with any age group.
4,A Must for the Software Developer Generalist,"The O'Reilly Pocket Reference series serves the need of software developers to quickly lookup how to code something that they don't do every day. The formula is quite strict. Like all of these books, this book is a hybrid of introduction, cookbook, and reference in a package that is small enough to easily fit several dozen on your bookshelf. What's good about the STL Pocket Reference is that it provides succinct descriptions of some very abstract concepts that are the lingua franca when dealing with the Structured Template Library. What's missing here is more sample code."
2,samples r better,"Samples, flow-charts would serve best to simply get to the point as to what the template is intended to do. As a pocket ref., it should not have paragraphs but just get to the pt & that's best w/illustrative, demonstrative, cases/examples, etc., & whatever happened to flowcharts?"
5,I love these things,"I love these little pocket references, since my new job I use custom container classes, but when I was using the STL this was a wonderful reference.I actually like these booklets better than Microsoft's electronic documentation, but Apple's XCode documentation system is still faster than paper."
3,A book is a book,"I enjoyed the book I like the author,kindle even pricey as it is,gets product to consumer quickly. I cannot think of one other thing to write."
4,A look at a powerful family with a few secrets,"I found this story to be both engaging and tragic, but in some places not wholly believable. Still, it is a good read. The characters are well-developed, and it definitely keeps the reader feeling involved. If you are a fan of Belva Plain, like me, you will find this book well worth your time."
3,Not one of Plain's best . . .,"The Carousel has a good plot and good detail. But the story leaves alot to be desired. Sally Grey has just found out that her five year old daughter, Tina, has been sexually abused. Sally is in shock but soon vows to find out who did it. The book goes through several storylines and plots. The characters get confusing at times but they are described in detail. The book was a little long and after the first chapter it really slowed down. The book ended abruptly and ruined the ending. The book is an okay read if you just need something to do. But if you're looking for a really good book, find another of Plain's books."
2,Unlikeable characters,"I did read the book from start to finish because Belva Plain crafts a good story and keeps you in suspense until the end.However, I could not find any empathy for several of the characters, and in fact disliked them immensely. Not all the villains got what they deserved in the end. I guess this is like real life!"
5,Nice kitty-cat,"I love her and her ""husband"" which I also ordered. Schleich makes their animals very realistic and these make a good pair."
5,Great for artists,"This lioness toy is a useful mini maquette for professional illustrators or wildlife artists who need general reference for big cat anatomy. All of the muscles are where they should be and the proportions are near perfect. Probably the most realistic of these types of small plastic sculpts (hopefully the sculptor is being given the opportunity to do more animal figurines of this quality). Mine spends most of it's time on a shelf, but it seems like it would be durable enough to withstand the usual abuses of the age group that it's intended for."
4,bumkins bibs,"the fabric of the bibs and the prints are good quality, nice fit around the neck, holds up well to washing"
4,great bibs,"these bibs are a little big & bulky & a little pricey, but they work great at catching almost all meeses and clean up great."
5,Bibs last a long time and continue to look great,We bought the first set of these bibs over a year and a half ago. The original are still going strong while the other brands of bibs have suffered the affects of constant use on an infant/toddler. I'm replacing it with the one brand that has held up. This one. I highly recommend them. The original set looks as good as the day we bought them.
5,great bibs!,I purchesed these bibs because the reviews were great. I totally agree. This bibs are really nice. At first I thought these bibs were thin and were not going to catch anything. But they do a great job and wash up nicely. The Dr Seuss theme is really cute. Everyone comments on them.
5,Large enough to catch all the spills,These bibs are stylish (no fire trucks or baseballs!) and easy to wipe off and launder. They are large so they cover a lot of real estate.
4,great bibs!,"These are great bibs as they can be rinsed off after use and re-used several times before washing them in the machine. My only complaint is that the neck closure does not get small enough so that food still sometimes leaks around my daughter's neckline onto her clothes. She is 7 months old and on the smaller side, so perhaps that will not be a problem as she grows. The bib area is a nice size, so overall they do a good job of covering clothes and preventing mess."
5,Love these things.,I got these and i love them. My son can pull them off. They don't stain. They don't have to go in to the washing machine and they don't have a layer of plastic that will get mold under it. get these they rock and they last.
4,Solid product,"They work awesome. My son is a messy eater and sometimes even vomits in this bib. He never gets wet.In response to other people thinking these are flimsy, I wonder if they ever actually used the bib or just assumed it was too thin. For me, the fact that this wasn't a thick, heavy plastic bib is what makes it so great. Those thick plastic bibs don't give an inch, liquid often slides right off them onto the lap. It defies logic that this is so thin and works so well. Does not feel like it would be waterproof, but it is.The reason this does not get five stars is because they only last a few months. Even with diligent washing and hanging to dry with the pockets inside out, they will start to get mildewy along the pocket. I can combat this for a while with a little vinegar, but I get grossed out quickly after this happens and just buy a few more. I have tried other products because of this, but haven't found anything that works near as good as these do when they are fresh."
4,Very pleased!,"These bibs are very durable and nicely cover the whole front of our 13 month old daughter. Also, the ""sleek"" fabric is easily wipeable (and don't stain), and because the bibs are not hard or plasticky, they lay nicely and don't bunch up in my toddlers face while sitting. Love 'em!"
3,"They do the job, but aren't worth the price.","The neck hole is big enough that food invariably gets onto the collar of my baby's shirt. She can also rip the bib off really easily and seems to dislike the slick texture more than that of softer, cloth-like bibs."
4,Kids are Messy,Make sure you have plenty of these on hand.They are thin enough to be portable and easy to clean but thick enough to have durability.
5,"Hands-down, the best bib out there!","We love these bibs!!! I bought them three years ago with my second son, and they held up well enough to use now with our third son. They clean up easy, air dry quickly, and protect his clothes against food and drinks. I wish I had them with my first son. Besides working exactly as promised, and their easy clean-up, they are so much less bulky than other weatherproof bibs we've used (like those weird rubbery ones). They take up about as much room in the diaper bag as a kleenex, have generous velcro fastener that allows for some of the thinest and chunkiest necks, and after nearly three years of constant use, I've yet to have any wear or tear on them. They may be a little pricier than some cheap drooler bibs at the store, but they are WELL worth the investment. I've bought these bibs for friends because they're so good."
5,Love the bib - a bit big for my 6 month old,"We got the bib for my son as he started solids since using cloth bibs were a bit too messy and after a certain point did not prevent his clothes from getting dirty. These bibs are on the big side resulting in his neck getting wet some times. But we know he'll grow into them. The pocket in the front catches all the dribbles associated with liquid-y solids when they first start cereals. They're super easy to wash/clean and small/compact enough that one goes with us everywhere we go. highly recommended. Currently, the only bibs we use."
5,Love them,"These are high quality, and the prints look great in person. I found them more generously sized than usual so they are not too tight for my 90th percentile 1+ year old (may be too large for a smaller baby). They are just as easy to rinse as those plastic bibs but not stiff. Very practical and fun.Update: I've had these for a year now and they are still as good as new, and still fit my now 2-year old. I saw another reviewer complain about brown spots but I haven't had any after a year+ use in both New York and Minneapolis water. It's also good to have a pack of 3 - before every meal, I let the baby choose one, and it makes him much more cooperative!"
5,Amazing! Best bibs on the market!,"""I loved these bibs for my 2 kids! I liked the Dr. Suess ones! So cute :) Best out of the tons of bibs that we've tested and tried. Durable, machine washable, super easy to clean up, and waterproof! Yay! Couldn't get better than that! :)"
4,Love!,"Easy to clean, velcro stays secure, and big enough to cover my 8 month old. What's better is you can wipe them with a clean cloth OR wash them in the washer and dry them in the dryer or hang dry. Either way - they are durable!"
5,"Expensive, but worth it!","I was hesitant to purchase these bibs due to how expensive they were, but the cloth bibs we were using were getting drenched, soaking through our baby's shirt, and really not doing much for keeping anything clean either. It was merely prolonging the time between putting it on and the clothes underneath needing to be changed. I finally caved and bought a pack of the Bumkins waterproof bibs, and now I LOVE them! They keep my little one dry, are super easy to clean, and help keep food from being stuck in his highchair as much. (The pocket catches a good deal, but he likes to drop stuff next to him too, so it can't help that!) All in all, I'd definitely buy these again! The velcro closure is great (and adjustable!), and he hasn't tried to get the bib off yet, but I do make sure it tucks below the highchair tray."
4,Not for my 7 month old but a neat bib,"Baby chews on it while baby food (stage 2) and water just slide off and get on clothes and high chair. Maybe it's better for older babies/children.Otherwise, a great bib. Soft and shiny, dries and cleans easily."
3,Seems to be getting stiff after a 2 months of heavy use,"So I got a three pack and gave 2 away and have been using one of these bibs for 2 months straight. I wash in the laundry about once a week and clean it in the sink and hang to dry the rest of the time. This week, I've noticed the bib seems stiff and there are specks of mold on the trim. I admit the latter (eew) could be user error and perhaps it has something to do with the stiffness? Maybe I washed it incorrectly? I'm not sure but now I'm back on Amazon looking for another solution."
5,Great Bibs!,These bibs are great! The velcro is nice and strong and the bib itself is quite large so it covers the entire front of the baby and most of the shoulders which is perfect! I highly reccommend these bibs
4,Great Bibs,"I got these bibs a little while ago when I started feeding my son solids. I really like the bibs, I love the prints, and the pocket, it catches spilled food, however, the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think the attachment for the neck should be better, allowing for babies with smaller necks to have a nice snug fit. The bib does indeed allow for adjustment with the bib, but its still a bit too big for my boy. I do like them though!"
5,Love these bibs!,"These bibs are perfect for our (sometimes) mess eater. They are a thin plastic so they can be wiped down and reused, unlike the cloth ones we started out with. The pocket is perfect for the little things that spill like crackers. The baby has learned to reach in and pull little bits out of the pocket too. We tried the bigger scoop style plastic bibs but the baby HATED those. This style is a perfect compromise. The multiple patterns available are very fun too."
3,ok for young child,Bib works well until your child can pull it off. Once this happens u need snap bibs. My child pulled it off defeating the purpose of the bib.
5,so easy to clea,"Love these bibs and the price was great. They are ez to clean, cute, and ez to carry around. Love them!!"
5,Will never use another fabric bib again!,Wish I found these sooner- would have saved a lot of laundry! These are great for quick cleanups and machine washable for deep cleaning too. Perfect for the diaper bag or vacation.
5,Best Bib EVER!,"I have now bought these bibs repeatedly for my own children, as well as gifts for several others. They are by far, the BEST BIBS EVER! They are soft & thin & comfortable for the kiddos to wear, yet waterproof & protect their cute little clothes. The velcro is secure but easy to use. I love the pockets, as they catch a lot of the mess & end up protecting little laps as well(& my kids have learned to eat ""seconds"" out of the pocket). They are so easy wash or rinse & they dry very quickly. I usually use one bib per day-rinse between meals/snacks & hang dry-then the bib is dry & ready for the next meal or snack. Perhaps a bit more pricey than some bibs, but worth every penny! You will NOT regret this purchase!"
4,"May seem expensive, but a great value","These are a bit pricey, but each one can last over a year.We picked up just one at a local ""fancy"" kids store because we liked the design so much, but then it lasted over a year!We just replaced that one with a 3 pack because we just had another baby and will need feeding bibs a bit longer.Also, we tried a few other gift feeding bibs from people and they just don't work very well... the pocket doesn't stay open,or it isn't comfortable for him to wear and he pulls it off, or it's too big or small.This really is the best one we've used and it looks good too and like I said it may fade from a million washings, but it lasts forever."
5,Super bibs - waterproof and nice looking,"I love the Dr. Seuss designs and the waterproof quality. I searched for bibs like this, and was very happy with this purchase. They are lightweight which makes them easy to wash and dry. Super durable and waterproof, great for feeding time!"
3,Good but expensive,"These bibs are worth the peace of mind in that the aren't made of PVC but they definitely are expensive and I find that they get mildewed easily. I had previously bought some non-pvc bibs at my local HEB and these were cheaper and outlasted two sets of these bibs....haven't been able to find any since then, which is why I bought these Bumkins again."
2,Not Absorbent So Limited Usefulness,"These bibs are made of a plastic material with no absorbency. When I use bibs, I like them to catch part of the food and also to fold them up to use as a napkin to wipe my child's face. That doesn't work with this bib. I don't recommend it."
2,Too easy for Baby to Remove,"We have two babies under the age of two, so we have tried every bib and really need them to work. This one may be good for a child under one, but our 20 month old yanks these off in a matter of seconds. Really surprised this bib got so many good reviews...not sure what is to love? I would definitely not recommend for an older child. For our 7 month old, this bib works fine, but a lot of things would work for him. For toddler, I recommend the JJCole with a snap closure. Harder to find, which is why I went online to Amazon to purchase, but works the best. Also buying the Bjorn bib today which is twice the cost, just to see if that will work as well (it also gets good reviews.)"
2,Great bib if they lasted...,"I really liked these bibs when they first arrived. Great Keith Haring artwork. Seemed to be sturdy material. All around nice product. But less than two months into using them, the velcro tabs sewn onto the bibs started to come off.Now two out of the three bibs are unusable because the velcro has fallen off. We weren't even using these as our only bibs, otherwise I doubt they would've lasted a month. Meanwhile theKushies Waterproof Bib, White Circle, Infantwe ordered at the same time as these are standing up great (and are cheaper!). The artwork isn't as nice, but who cares if they are no longer usable."
3,Colours too flashy,"Yes, the bibs are easy to clean and are a great size. As costly as they were, I didn't get much use out of them though because my 6 mth old was so distracted by the patterns on them, that feeding was becoming more like play time. I know it sounds ridiculous, but the patterns are just too flamboyant for the purpose it serves - to pick up spillage, not to entertain my little one. I'm happy that my baby finds the colours engaging, but imagine me with a spoon trying to compete with his bib for attention (yes, imagine!). It was simply too much."
3,Not for young infants,"I like the idea of just rinsing a bib rather than adding to my laundry pile. However this did not work for my 6 month old just starting solids. Her food right now is very watery thus it just slides right down. Since she is new to wearing a big, she lifts it up since it is also so light thus food that was collected in the little pocket is dribbling everywhere. Yes it is funny but using an absorbent cloth bib is much better. I think we will eventually use it when she starts having more solid / finger foods but for that runny food, it is not helpful.Oh and rinse it right away. It sort of absorbs odors even after washing!"
3,"Great product, lousy shipping.","Let me start of by saying the bibs are 100% awesome, just what I was looking for. They clean up nicely (I have yet to try them in the washing machine I just wash them up with soapy water in the sink) and keep my daughter clean during meals. Now the reason for my low rating, the shipping was aweful! I used 2 day priority shipping and didn't recieve my bibs for over a week an a half! For this reason alone I will not be ordering from this company ever again, so dissapointed."
5,Best bibs!,"These bibs are my favorite. I have used them through my two kids. They wash off easily, are portable, don't stain, protect them well, and hold up great. You can through them in the wash to get them thoroughly clean. They are the only bibs I need. I use them over all others."
4,Great bibs!,These bibs have been great for us as our son has started eating baby food. The other cloth bibs we had for bottles only were just soaking up the food and there was LOTS of laundry. These bibs wipe off easily and are big enough to cover a large area. The pocket is also great for snacks like cheerios - some of them end up in the pocket instead of on the floor. My only complaint is that I wish the velcro was a little stronger and maybe in the back instead of the side. My son can rip the bib off when he really wants to...
1,not the same since production moved to China,"These bibs used to be the greatest, thin, silky, completely waterproof and super-fast-drying material. But the company moved production from the US to China and it is just not the same now. It is waterproof, but the stiffness causes it to get in the baby's way and because it doesn't flow over baby's lap, more food ends up on the clothes. But if you can find one of the old ones made in the USA, those are great! The old style is so soft and supple, super-comfy for baby, and a breeze to wash (I just dunk the old one in dishwater and rinse) and dries amazingly fast. I wish they were still making these the same! I did find a cheap bib at Meijer that felt thin and silky like the old version of Bumkins but I haven't tried it yet to know for sure if it works as well."
3,they're okay,"I really wanted to like these bibs (and I did, at first!) because they had such good reviews and they were expensive.pros: big, easy to clean (rinse with mild soap and dry)cons: easy to yank offNo matter how well they were washed and dried, they developed brown spots...every single one of them. I ended up having to throw them out when the brown spots started getting really bad. I got a new set thinking maybe I hadn't been washing them well enough. Same problem."
5,Love our Bumkins bibs!,"These bibs are a must-have when feeding your baby solids! We had used these bibs for our 1st child & loved them. I only found 1 bib now that our 2nd child has come along and has started solid baby foods. I was happy to find the Bumkims bibs here at Amazon & purchased the Dr. Seuss print. I love the print! These bibs make clean-up so easy! Just rinse under the faucet, ring them out & hang them to dry within an hour. You can also put them in the washer to clean & there is no need to put them in the dryer. The food does not stain these bibs, even if you don't wash it right away. They are definitely worth the price! I would recommend them to anyone (especially those who dread trying to scrub out the stains those dirty cloth bibs)!"
4,Love these bibs except for one thing - too slippery!,"These bibs are great - nice colors/designs that my son loves, nice coverage, easy to wash off, and can throw in the wash if needed. The pockets are also great - they usually catch whatever ends up sliding down my son's front. The only thing I don't like about them is that the material is lightweight and a bit slippery so the bibs work their way up into my son's face as he's eating. I've solved the problem by using some clothes pins - I pin each side of the bib to my son's high chair straps, and then the bib stays put. So overall I'm very happy with these bibs! If they'd find a way to make them non-slip so they'd lie flat, they'd be perfect!"
4,"Great for travel | folds up tight, covers well","Great for travel | folds up tight, covers the kiddos shoulders and torso well. I still prefer the silicone bjorn or tommy tippee ones just because the rubbery ones are easier to handwash or blast with hot water and dry quickly."
4,Great bibs for feeding solids,"I love these bibs so much that I ordered a second set.I'm a first time mom and I've received countless cloth bibs as gifts. Those worked great when my son was just drinking bottles, but they aren't cutting it now that he's eating solids. I have bought a couple other bibs similar to these (by JJ Cole and Tommee Tippee), but these are my favorite.I like that they are soft and thin, so they don't irritate my son's neck and don't take up a lot of room in my baby bag. I like the pocket, but I do have to point out that it doesn't catch all of the food. The Tommee Tippee and JJ Cole bibs do a better job of catching food."
5,Good product,"These are super soft so if you do not like flimsy bibs, then do not get this product. The velcro seems strong but my 6.5month old can still undo it though. They're also big so it covers a wide area of the chest."
5,Bib I love them,Wish they came in bigger sizes. Rinses well in just dishwater after each use an dries in seconds! Throw away all ypur cloth bibs an just get three for life! I just think the material and design are great.
4,Why the difference in quality?,I think these bibs are awesome and the only ones we use. We have a kieth herring set that is much thicker than the rest. The backing is white. The rest are much thinner. I will continue to use them all. Can someone tell me why one set is such higher quality than the rest? All were purchased from Amazon and all within the last year. Thank you.
5,Bibs that dry quick and hold up!,"These bibs are definitely cute, but the best part for me is that they actually work and fit my child (19 months), and they dry quickly. So far after a few months of use these seem to be holding up pretty well, and are perfectly fine when rinsed, twisted out and then hung to dry. I throw these in the wash every so often to keep them fresh, but these so far are holding up great, and much better than some more expensive bibs that I bought."
2,"Bibs are good, but amazon was deceiving.","The bibs are good quality, and do last well (I have another set that I bought from the store for my older son.)HOWEVER... beware if you select the set with the blue circles, green cars, and blue cats and dogs. I thought the name of this set, ""colors may vary"" meant that there are various/multi- colors in the set. There are a variety of other sets to choose from with other names (boy assortment, girl assortment, keith harring, dr. seuss, etc.), so why shouldn't I assume that the bibs pictured for each selection are the ones delivered?! Instead, I received three pink flowery bibs, not even close to the colors pictured.As a very busy mom of two kids under the age of 2, I rely on amazon to save me time as I can't always get to the store. Instead, this will end up taking me twice as long.I recommend bumkins, but if you care about the color selection, make the trip to a store and pick them out yourself."
3,Cute and Foodproof but Not Really Waterproof,These are super cute bibs and have a great pocket for babies that want to feed themselves but may drop bits. They protect clothes from food but they aren't really waterproof. They don't seem to soak through but they definitely feel damp on the backside when they are wet on the front.
4,Love it,"Did not know abt these till my baby sitter told me about them. It's not ideal while yr baby drinks only milk, it's for when they start the other stuff. It wipes clean, dries super fast, love it"
5,My favorites!,"We received the same set of bibs when my first son was born in 2009. We still use them 2 of them on regular basis. However, I decided to order new ones and to my surprice they are still on the market!I recived it quickly (thanks to Amazon!), but noticed that the material they were made of is a little differnt this time. Not as soft as it used to be.I wouldn't be so sure if I didn't find one brand new bib from 2009 a day before I received this order.Otherwise, I highly recommend these bibs to anyone! They are the best!"
4,"Great bibs, but do fade a bit over time","These bibs are great for my 1yr old daughter. It covers a large area, any spills she makes usually goes right in the bottom pocket of the bib, and it is very easy to wipe and clean. I use these bibs everyday for multiple foods and after about 4-5 months, the top of the bib started to fade as though the color was rubbing off. No big problem, just an observation. Also, my daughter loves to pull bibs off when she doesnt want them on anymore and these bibs are fairly harder to pull off, so I'm pretty thankful for the tough velcro. I would recommend these bibs."
5,Best bibs I've found for toddlers,"I love these bibs! My son has been using all 3 since he was 1 year old (he's now 3.5). They are soft (not stiff), machine washable, and they have the catch-all pocket...plus they are really cute."
5,The best bibs ever,"I discovered the Bumpkins bibs when my 4-year-old great granddaughter began to sit in a high chair. I've only had one bib and she wore it for nearly 3 years. It is like new. The bib is comfortably soft, and easily wiped or washed. I wash it at the kitchen sink, roll it in a towel, hang it and it is dry in less than an hour. Every week or so, I run it through the washer and hang it to dry. On occasion, I've put the bib and a towel in the dryer on air. I always made sure to connect the Velcro fastener first. In 10 minutes the bib is ready for use.I have ordered the set of 3 boys bibs now for my little 1-year-old great grandson. Having more than one is a new luxury. They are so soft, they will store easily in a drawer.Without doubt, these are the best bibs I have ever found, and believe me, I have tried many!Bumkins Waterproof SuperBib, Unisex, 3-Pack"
5,Excellent!,"I was very pleasantly surprised, it was more than I expected: very easy to clean, very soft to touch and the fabric is very flexible (not like those rigid plastic bibs). Also it is adjustable to my little 6 months old's neck. I will definitely buy more of these."
5,Very practical and pleasant esthetically,"We like these - waterproof face, easy to place and remove, easy to clean. They are all very pretty so the little girls really do not mind using them! (""they are princess-like, daddy!""):-)A good buy!"
2,Moldy Bibs!,"I was excited when I got these. The designs were cute, and the material seemed high quality. The size is great, and they worked well to keep messes off our very messy eater's clothes.We used these for a couple months, at most, and they always got a wipe-down after every meal or complete washing when necessary. We kept them dry, allowing them to get air after a wipe-down or washing, but they still blackened in spots, like a mildew or mold. Needless to say, we had to throw them away. I was excited about these, and for the money, I expected much better. I was disappointed that these didn't work out for us."
3,Velcro Problem,These bibs are ok but Kushies last longer. I have a home daycare with 4 hungry toddlers. I wash and bleach the bibs each evening so the bibs that I use have to take a lot of use. The Bumkins bibs are really cute and wash well but the velcro tabs have come off on all of them. This has never happened with the Kushies and a couple of Kushies bibs have been in the daycare trenches for 3 years. I managed to sew the velcro back on by hand but it is frayed and I am ordering up Kushies replacements now. I am sure the Bumkins are headed for the trash once the new ones arrive.
3,Ok bib...,I find the material and size to be good and it's nice that you can wash it after they wear it and use it again later in the day. The only negative I have found is that the spill catcher does not always stay open enough to catch food and my daughter still ends up with food on her lap while eating.
1,Pocket is useless!!!!!!,"The bib is fine until your baby insists on feeding him/herself or spits food back out. Then it slides all the way down past the pocket and onto his/her diaper bulge and lap or pants or the highchair seat because the pocket doesn't stay open. The pocket only catches about 10% of whatever falls its way which still leaves me with a baby who needs a complete bath after EVERY meal, and a full change of clothes because the food has soaked through the pants and the bottom of her onesie down to her diaper!"
2,Not sure what all the great reviews are about...,"Maybe these are great for older babies who don't drool or spit their water or juice back out? Whenever my baby spits her drink back out, it dribbles underneath her chin and falls onto the top of the bib which then slides right down the back of the bib because these are not water-absorbant. I like the green sprouts water-absorbant bibs 100 times better than these ones! She always ends up wet after I use the bumkin bibs."
3,"I really wanted to love these, but they didn't stay on","I really wanted to love these, b/c they were expensive and had good reviews. They are soft, and easy to clean though. However, one of them left a stain that would not come off. I like the whole idea and concept of it, but my 5-month old kept trying to yank it off, and I felt like it was making meal time messier. Instead, I bought the Aden & Anais Burpy Bibs and I love these. They go all around the baby and you never have to yank it down from their hands. Overall, they're just OK, but better than your average cloth bibs.Pros: Soft, great idea, easy to clean offCons: Stained, easy to yank off,"
3,Great until it was smelly...,"We had originally bought a single Bumkins bib, and I think they changed the way that they made the bibs because this pack felt different than the original one we had purchased. While this set seemed thicker, we have had some odor issues with this set. After using it for a month or so, it started to smell sour. No matter what I did to wash it and keep it dry, I couldn't seem to get rid of the smell. I've thrown it in the washer, tried to bleach it, but I couldn't get rid of the smell so I ended up throwing it away. I liked the set while we used it since it was light, could be folded easily, and caught the crumbs."
5,Great Designs!,"I just love these bibs. They are big enough to cover up the whole front of baby, they are easy to clean and the velcro holds up well. The best part is the Keith Haring designs! Who needs a boring bib? The designs are adorable and cool for a boy or a girl. Would make a great shower gift."
5,great bibs,"These bibs are great. They are pvc, phlalate, and BPA free which is very important to me. They are also very durable and clean easily. Also, the velcro on the neckline is placed well so it doesn't scratch my baby's neck like so many other cheapo bibs."
5,Only the beginning...,"I have always enjoyed stories of the Shaolin temples and their history and this book is top of my list. It describes in great detail the daily activities of the monks, their training, ideals, relationships and of the painstaking efforts they made to protect their simple way of life from the corrupt armies of the time. I really enjoyed the friendship that develops between the White Priest and Takuan and the depth of description the author uses to make me feel as if I know them both. Even more exciting is that I learned that this book is part of a series where the friendship continues. If you like this type of history get it, you won't be disappointed."
3,"Seem durable and they fit, just not perfectly","I have an '01 Tacoma Xtra Cab.... these mats are thin enough to bend into place with a little bit of convincing, but it's not a perfect fit. That said, they're thick enough that they don't curl up or crinkle from the weight of your foot like some of the super cheap plastic ones are prone to. The liner edges don't overlap the edge of the carpet by the door as far as I was hoping, so some water may settle in there from snowy shoes. The spikes on the bottoms of the liners will hold them in place well. It doesn't bother me at all, but the tan isn't an exact match for my truck's carpet.They're not perfect, but they are good enough that it's not worth the hassle of returning them."
1,VERY buggy,"I am an avid fan of Turn-based strategy games. I also adored the original AOW. Naturally, I rushed to buy AOW2. Sad to say, it was a mistake. The game locks up, is very quirky on map transitions and the technical support from the website seems to consist of the phrase ""Have you tried reinstalling?"" Lest someone think I am playing on some esoteric, exotic machine, I am not. It is a 3 month old Dell Dimension that plays almost all of my games flawlessly and didn;t even quiver over Neverwinter Nights, which I am told is near miraculous... Anyway, I cannot recommend this game simply for the bugs, technical glitches, lock-ups and total invisibility of tech support."
4,Radical pictures for radical eyes,"Miron Zownir's odyssé into the darker sides of humanity is extremely intrigueing. He shows us a world that we often prefer to believe does not exist. From New York and Berlin in the early eighties to the purgatory of post-communist Eastern Europe. Homeless people, drug abusers, handicapped people, transexuals, cruising homosexuals and prostitutes (and their activities) are his subject. In stark black and white photographs, with no info except date and location, he tells the story of the marginal people. The ones who don't fit in, the ones who never communicate with us normal, well fed, happy people. As the foreword claims, this is a modern Dante's inferno. But at the same time there is a compassion for Zownir's subjects, a compassion that has resulted in this great book. Radical Eye is so uncommercial, that one must believe that this is a labour of love on Zownir's part. It really makes you think."
1,"Good images, Cheesy Music","This video is great if you like cheesy, vapid music and no narration. Not what I expected. Great imagery, but very little information."
3,Not bad...,"I bought this DVD about a month ago. If I had to choose between this one and Yellowstone I would choose this one. The music in this DVD is more appropriate. I do not care for time-lapsed photography though, it is not good for the mind, and they wouldn't have lost anything had they left it out completely.There is some awesome footage in this DVD but I wouldn't spend $20 on it again, for sure. If you are looking for relaxation The Waves DVDs are definitely the best. Voevodsky just needs to do something other than beaches. Wilderness DVDs, a site that sells DVDs made by the blind, also has some awesome relaxation DVDs and they offer a free sample collection, which I have, very, very nice."
4,Pop Geography for the pop-up set,"Kids love pop up books, but outgrow most of them pretty early- often about the time that they get good at not tearing the pop up tabs! This is a fun book w/ plenty of interesting little geography facts for slightly older kids (say, up to 2nd grade; maybe 3rd if they are not strong readers). American kids (at least those who aren't in Montessori programs) don't get much geography, and this is a fun way to broaden their horizons a bit. Our 6 y.o. thoroughly enjoyed reading through it on her own, quizzing us from time to time. Be prepared!"
3,"O.K. But not a ""Go-To"" Game","We've had this game roughly six months, and my five year old is interested in playing it occasionally, but it's not one of those games he wants to play again and again. I don't think it's as engaging as some of the other games we've got (like the Cranium ones), so he gets a little bored with it."
4,Frustration on ice,"As other reviewers have mentioned, the game is easy to set-up and put away. I took off one star mainly because the penguins occasionally fall into the crack between the wobbling iceberg and the stable platform and are difficult to remove. In addition, my son gets frustrated with the game very quickly, since a falling penguin can potentially take the other penguins down with him. I'm trying to teach him to relax, but six-year-olds cannot always be persuaded that life will go whether the penguins remain upright or not. We've learned to play a few quick rounds and then try a different activity entirely."
3,Loads of fun until.......,"episode six. To finish that episode, I would estimate you would need compound eyes and at least three hands. The third hand would be to operate the <Enter> key because of the many error messages telling you there is an error and no debug is available. This occurs while you are in the arena fighting one of the nastiest opponents yet in this game. Were it not for this bug, I would give this game a five star rating."
2,The metal spike breaks!,"I own many Gardena products and have been pleased with the quality. This sprinkler is the lone exception. The sprinkler worked as advertised, but this is the third one I have owned and on every one the metal spike breaks, leaving a short stubb of metal too short to perform the function for which it was intended, namely, to hold the sprinkler in place. I have written to Melnor/Gardena to purchase a replacement part (just the spike) and am waiting to hear from them. Given the Gardena emphasis on quality I would expect better. If Melnor will not let me buy just the spike (at a reasonable price), I will probably switch to the plastic based sprinkler."
4,I love it!,I like this product so much that I have recommended it to friends already and have more ordered. It makes day-to-day things easier to deal with and I feel better overall when I take it. I forgot to take it 2 days in a row and could definitely tell the difference. Bravo!
4,Review of The Partnership Book,We are starting a new partnership and this book contained everthing we needed to prepare partnership agreement and pointers to other legal forms required. Would have had to pay an attorney to prepare agreement without this book. We only payed for a review. Saved us big bucks!
5,Maximum Performance: The Man's Guide to Erection & Potency,"It is great, the only problem is that the DVD has lots of little scratches, but it's still work fine. Very entertaining"
1,sonnet sucks,I tried to buy something from their online store. Ended up no one is there... no reply emails to confirm the purchase or anyone at the switch boards! They don't have a business running! Beware. I'd purchase something from Newer tech.
2,"OK, but pricey for what you get","I own about 20 of the 31805-4 and 31820-4 Gardena timers. All of them have worked for at least 12 months, but many have failed within 24 months. I don't like having to buy more of them, but there's really nothing else available. One additional ""problem"" with the 31820-4 is that when you choose longer watering times you must also choose longer periods between waterings and when you choose shorter watering times you must also choose shorter periods between waterings--in other words you can't choose short waterings with long periods between."
5,AWESOME Christian Metal!!!!!!!,"This CD rules, it is a christian group which sounds like RAGE or KoRn. If you say you don't want to listen to christian music because it doesn't sound like what you like, well ""Every Day Life"" shows you there are christian groups for every kind of music. More to the point I recommend this CD to anyone who likes metal, you will not be disappointed. My favorite track would have to be ""Salt Cirlces."" Their Disgruntled album is also good. Some of my friends who listen to KoRn and Limp Bizkit, really liked ""Every Day Life"" and were even thinking of buying the CD."
2,Poor Quality Patchwork,I bought this as a replacement leather jacket as the previous one (same exact jacket) lasted almost 8 years and was a good quality jacket. This one the patchwork is not sticthed well and there is loose threads all over the jacket. I tried to get them to replace it and have gotten no where. I feel I am stuck with a jacket that will be falling apart before the first winter is over.
3,jacket,"It's a fine jacket, but couldn't tell from the picture online that it was a patchwork style leather. But service was good and promptly delivered."
2,Good Service. Good Price. However...,"I needed a jacket that was cheap for a show that I am doing. Ordered this jacket, because you really can't beat the price. The jacket arrived very quickly. Let me re-state... The service was excellent. The problem I have is that the photo really doesn't show that this jacket is a mosaic design and you really can't smell the jacket when ordering. It's going to take some getting used to, because it's got this weird smell to it. I really wish I could've enlarged the jacket better when ordering. I think it's done purposely because if people saw the frankenstein looking patchwork design for this leather jacket, then it would not sell. Someone stated it in another review, you get what you pay for. Again, if you need something, like I did, that you really do not care what happens to it, then this is your jacket. If you want something that looks nicer, then you may want to buy something else."
2,ripped pocket,I recived the leather jacket with the inside right pocket torn. Quality of leather seemed ok
4,for the money,"For the money it's great. little shine at first, but it breaks in nice. The leather is not the thickest, but not bad."
1,Don't buy it,I bought this item because I think it was nice but it was not the same as in the webite. I try to return and email them how many times but there is no any response at all.NapolineTM Roman RockTM Design Genuine Leather Jacket
1,The Smell is Horrible!,"I should have known that there was something wrong when there's a leather jacket offered for $20 bucks. BUT I figured hey, this is Amazon, how bad could it be? As soon as I opened the plastic wrap package, the entire house was filled with this toxic smell that was really sickening. We hung the jacket in the garage and it stunk up the garage. It's hanging in the back yard right now, and when you go outside you can still smell it. It's going back in plastic. This time a garbage bag. Trust your instincts!"
3,Good product for the money.,"This is a great starter biker jacket. I am a new rider and didn't want to invest in an expensive jacket yet. This is great for the money. It has a cheap look, but I was not looking for top-of-the-line yet. Perfect for the money."
3,Lousy shipping,Ordered the item on the 12th and paid for expidated shipping and 3 days later still haven't recieved the coat. Tried calling the customer service number and got recording and no has yet to call me back. If you pay for 1-3 day shipping then you should get it in 1-3 days NOT 3-10
1,reclamo,En realidad me resulto muy grande y al recibir el producto observe que tenia algunas imperfecciones. Es de la pocas veces que mi producto no es lo esperado.
3,Not exactly speed/thrash but still good melodic metal.,"Compared to River Disturbance, I like this album better. It's a bit more progressive and it's easy to see why other reviewers would compare it to Queensryche. Though I'm more partial to the earlier straight ahead thrash releases, Jimmy Brown & crew show they are quite diverse as musicians. I have yet to get the CD, but I still got the cassette in my collection. It was a lucky find in a new & used music store. I'd rather listen to this than Micheal W Smith."
1,a waste of money,this software hasn't been updated in 5 years. it has bugs that are immediately apparent when trying to use the shed wizard (you tell it you don't want a rear door and it adds one anyway). it is seriously limited in that you can only add 1 window per wall.the list of issues is long. the CAD program it's built with is 5 major releases behind the current version. the company's online 'support' is what you'd have expected of an online presence 10 years ago. trying to send an email for support is next to useless and requesting a refund is worse.save yourself some aggravation and don't bother.
3,Good Conceptual 3D Viewer,"Product lacks the detail required for material ordering, and detail for actual construction of a finished shed."
3,OK,This program is a very basic cad program with little to offer. If your into designing using cad I would buy better version and spend a little more money. I got this program cheap and decided to go back to my 9.2 version which is much better. All depends on what you want to do with it.
3,This book needed a good editor,"I think this book needed a good editor. Some of the directions are not clearly written. I'm a writer, and even I had a hard time deciphering some of the text. Illustrations are somewhat helpful, but the layout is confusing. It's not always easy to tell which illustration goes with which step. It would have been better to include photos of hands folding the scarves.Some of the tying methods are nice -- traditional and classic techniques that I can wear to the office. But a lot of them are kind of weird -- even outdated-looking. I can't see going to work with three huge scarves braided together with pearls. Some of the techniques have a funky '70s disco look, but I guess that's in style.Also, the author includes options for only a couple of sizes of scarves -- most of them quite large."
4,Very good reference!,"I liked a lot of the ideas! It shows some unique ways to tie various shaped scarves. I have many scarves that I never wore because I didn't have a clue how to tie them, and this book has helped greatly. Be sure to get a scarf ring! Some neat ideas include using beads or pearls wrapped or braided into the scarf!"
4,"Clear, color illustrations, simple directions","It's difficult to find updated books with color illustrations and clear directions. Some of the illustrations in this book are dated; however, others are still fashionable. Stores have beautiful scarves for sale and many are purchased; however, I seldom see anyone wearing them except as simply draped across the shoulders in no particular style. This casual method is easy, usually becoming and not overly fussy but I believe another reason is that no one actually knows how to tie scarves. If we must use older books to teach ourselves, I can recommend this book as perhaps not the greatest but certainly helpful."
1,how to tie Scarves,"Unfortunately the book is now seriously outdated. interesting read for ""styles "" that could be considered in previous decades, or if you needed to dress up for a ""decade party"".not what I needed which was a ""modern"" take on how to tie scarves unfortunately.Some of the styles could be adapted however if you were a good fashionista."
4,GOOD QUALITY - SIZE RUNS SMALL,"THE JACKET IS WELL MADE AND LOOKS GREAT. I'VE HAD SEVERAL COMPLIMENTS. THE LABELED SIZE HOWEVER IS NOT A STANDARD AMERICAN MEASURE OR CUT. I'M 5'9"" AND 150 LBS. I WEAR A 14.5 FITTED DRESS SHIRT WITH ROOM TO SPAIR. AFTER READING SOME REVIEWS ABOUT THIS JACKET'S SIZING, I ORDERED A MEDIUM. IT FITS WITH BARELY ENOUGH ROOM TO CROSS MY ARMS. I'D JUDGE THIS TO BE TWO SIZES SMALLER THAN A STANDARD AMERICAN MEDIUM. BEFORE YOU BUY, CHECK OUT THE MERCHANT'S INVENTORY OF ALTERNATE SIZES AND THE EXCHANGE POLICY. YOU MAY WELL NEED TO USE IT."
3,An inch longer than a dollar bill.,"WARNING - THIS DOLL IS SMALLA dollar bill is 6 inches long...this doll is 7"" long.Perfect for a stocking stuffer.I bought this last year when these had JUST come on the market so I'm sure the price has probably some way down since my purchase.The cotton will stain easily.If you are buying this as a collector you might want to spray it with scotch guard."
5,A Sweet Memory,"These toys were purchased as a Xmas present for an adult who grew up with the book. I cant answer the questions related to a child playing with the toy however, they are great renditions for someone who has very fond memories of the book and it's characters."
3,As good a dramatization you can get for Gene Smith,"Gene Smith was a loner (as are many photojournalists or documentarians) so a lot of the movie was him talking to himself. Does display a lot of his work and you can perhaps get an idea of what went through such an intense man's head when out making all the photos, telling all the stories he did with his pictures. If you've heard of Gene Smith, get this. If you're interested in Documentary photography, you should get this too!"
4,Wolo 340 Bull Horn,"Wolo 340 Bull HornFairly easy installation, Was pretty tight fit under a Subaru hood. I used it to replace another auxiliary horn that I had previously installed, so the wiring was already in place and I did not have to sort through the factory wiring. It is louder than the auxiliary horn I had purchased from a local auto parts store and definitely louder than the wimpy factory horn. The sound produced is more like you would expect from a large cruise or cargo ship. If the sound had been more like that from an air horn on a semi truck I would have given it 5 stars, however it will still get someone's attention. Nice product, well made, easy installation, reasonable price. Knowing what I know now, I still would have purchased it."
1,Doesn't sound like earlier ones!!!,"In the past 10 years, I have bought 5 of these. This one sounds NOTHING like the other 4. Looks the same, etc. but has a pukey whaaaa sound. I didn't check the sound before mounting, (why should I after buying 4 earlier), so I'm just keeping it since it's very difficult to remove. DONT BUY IT YOU WONT LIKE IT..."
2,Wolo Model 340 Bull Horn,Back in the 50's I used to own a 6 volt lever operated bull horn that looked just like this one but it was louder and had a variable pitch to it to make it sound more realistic. I am very disappointed in this one. I hope Wolo will make improvements in the 12 volt model. It definitely is not loud enough.
3,Memories and Discoveries,"This video brought back many fond memories of the cartoon series that would delay my homework from school in the 60's. Like the DVD, Roger Ramjet--Hero of Our Nation, this DVD continues to bring us more cartoons of the Cold War Era. It is faithful in its production...don't expect Hi-Fi sound for it was never there. There is very little movement in the cartoon, but the way it is done makes it very entertaining and brings much fun.If only the producers of the disk had not given us the opening and closing theme of each and every cartoon, the disk would be viewable in its entirety. Instead, no matter how much of a Roger Ramjet fan you are, you will find it painstaking to hear the song over and over again. That is the only reason for the rating of 3."
1,Crumbs from the table,"This book details late Byzantine art (mostly icons, medallions, and manuscript illuminations) during the reign of Constantinople's last ruling dynasty, the Palaiologoi. Illustrations are small and the art historical writing reads like a random collection of graduate-level symposium papers (on such topics as church vestments and late tomb sculpture) and largely failing to engage the reader. The lack of narrative focus and quality works of art also lends an overall impression that this exhibition represents a culling of whatever happened to be at hand to produce yet another ""blockbuster"" that lacks much of either faith or power."
2,Unsatisfying,"When I first started playing this game, I really liked it. The graphics were decent and the idea behind the game was good. After playing for two weeks, I became very bored and rather than play the missions, I gathered a large collection of weapons and laid the smack down on the city and city officials. Now, other than just a stress reliever, this game is dead to me. I don't recommend spending your money on this one. Wait a couple of weeks until your friends get bored with it and then borrow theirs."
3,this game is hard!,Having played and beaten GTA Vice City and San Andreas with ease i bought this game and it is alot harder. With enemy gangsters shooting at you every other block in the city get used to dying despite cheat codes if you decide to use themfor the players who are used to the in game map with your player location on it this game does not offer one which makes getting lost a lot easier
1,fun for the first five minutes,"I liked the originality of this game, but most of the missions are tedious, esp. the ones that require you to race against time. The fact that the console version doesn't allow you to save during a mission is simply silly..."
1,totally violent,This game is way to violent. Why would it be so much fun to hurt someone. they say it's not for kids but I see many kids playing these games.Why do you think there's so much violence and other things like that in this world. It's partly because of these kinds of vidio games
3,"Its fun, but PS2 version is better.","The game is fun, but if you have a PS2, get it for that. This game lags a bit and gets tiring. You walk around a city trying to complete objectives and it gets really old, really fast. This game is alright...but if your into PC games get another."
3,It only works if......,"I preorder this game back in February and I waiting anxiously for it to come out. It finally came, and I fly down stairs and load it up. It doesn't work. I restart the computer, It still won't work. Finally one a maricle it works, but it is slooooow. Unless you have all the system requirements, don't even bother with this game. Either find some new game to play or get a new computer."
1,GAME SO OLD WON'T PLAY,"I got GTA3, looked at the minimum system requirements. My system far passed the requirements! Installed it, opened it and started the game. It was optimizing itself to my Radeon Prophet video card, top of the line! played the game, it was dark and all of the details where very bad! I couldn't make out a thing, not even in the day! Next time Rockstar needs to look and change the format of the game before they put it on p.c!"
1,"Crude, immature, low class?","This game has to be the crudest game ever made, I think the last game that was this bad was redneck rampage, this game has way too much mindless violence, which I guess apeals to simple minds, no plot, and gameplay which goes nowhere, I was so bored after an hour of playing this I poped in Max Payne and stated to re-play it after beating it. I would pass on this one, get HitMan 2 instead, at least that game does not stink as bad as this."
3,Has some bugs,I own a AMD athlon 850 and it gets a little jerky on some areas I don't know what it is but my computer makes the recomended requirments. NOT MINIMUM and it still isn't doing that well. Some system it does well and others it doesn't I recomend it if you have a 1.0 ghz or higher. otherwise you probably may think about it.
1,"Great game, but not for PC","This is probably the best game there is on the market, FOR PS2. Because I don't have PS2, I bought the game for PC figuring it would be just as much fun. Unfortunately, I never got to find out. The system requirements are unbelievable. Sure I was able to install it, but the game wuldn't run because it requires 12MB of audio memory. I created as much space as possible on my comp. ant it still wouldn't run. Unless you have the world's greatest PC supermachine, don't waste your money on this ..."
3,The Ultimate Anti-Climax,"This game lets me do all those things I have been fiending to do since video games came into my life. I wanted to be able to do whatever I wanted, including heinously violent acts and all that stuff. To be blunt, how this game got such universal acclaim is beyond me. It's a fun game, for the first 10 minutes. Wow, I just shot an old lady, here comes the ambulance, oh wow I got in the ambulance and ran over the paramedics, I didn't even crack a sadistic smile. The critics said its like playing a video game version of Goodfellas, I'm sorry but thats a little off. There isn't any weight to the violence, its just random slaughter, which isn't really all that funny or original. Rockstar Games originally defended their Grand Theft Auto games by saying the violence is cartoonish, I don't know how they defend this, because its obvious this is the game they really wanted out of the other games. Anyway, I really wanted to love this game, but shock value does not a good game make. ..."
1,Very unique and original,"Opened up a new line of genre, very unique gameplay and expansive environment. But riddled with glitches and imperfections. Enough so, to make this very frustrating. Almost seems impossible at times. Fun for a few hours, but afterwards i wouldnt ever play it again. Not worth the money."
1,Stinks! Stinks Bad!,"This game must have been made for mindless teenagers, all it consists of is mindless violence with no plot or story, I think it stinks, to top it off it does not work at all on Windows 95 and works [poorly] on Windows 98, on XP its choppy and slow, the violence is crude and I think it sends a bad message to kids or anyone with a weak mind that plays it, I suggest getting Max Payne, and least in Max Payne although having some realistic violence is not as crude and badly produced as this monstrosity."
5,By the way -,Anybody who degrades this game due to the violence or crime factor simply can't face the truth that this IS what happens...Ice
3,"good, but overrated","I was just as surprised as anyone at first. Beautiful scenergy and landscapes; free roaming in a city; guns and blood.My involvement in the game, however, ended shortly after 2 weeks of playing it. The missions, although creative, failed to spark my interest. The bad cut sequences (worse than in _Return of Castle Wolfenstein_, IMO) did little to encourage me to finish the missions and rather forced to simply prefer run around killing things.Like I said: beautiful, but boring. The initial shock value wares off after but a few days. For me, considering I actually purchased a copy from here on Amazon.com, it was one of my worst spent $[amount]."
5,FUN AND WORKING!!!!,"To start it off, I DID have a problem with the game. The text wouldn't show when it was supposed to so at the main screen you couldn't read anything. I contacted Tech Support and they knew the problem right away. They said to go to microsoft......Download that and install it and then start the game up..YOU WILL BEE ABLE TO READ THE TEXT!!!! After I fixed this problem, I played the game on my Pentium 4 Dell Dimension 8200 with my NVIDIA GeForce 2 and it runs GREAT and better looking then the Playstation 2 version. O yeah, just if u were wondering, THIS GAME IS A PORT....DON'T BE EXPECTING ANYTHING NEW!!!"
3,NO MULTI?????,"What is up with this? Deciding to cancel the multiplayer option? Jesus christ it would've leveled gaming today if there was. Well if your better at console then PC, get GTA3 for ps2."
5,iNmature audiences,"well seeing how this is for iNmature audiences i feel that this game is for anyway looking for a good time playing a fun game. It can literally takes months to master, and its never ever gets old. i do have one question, are you going to be able to play it over LAN ?"
5,Those are lies..........,"My computer is a 864 MHZ, with a Pentium 3 processor, with 15 GB free disk space and 128 MB RAM and this game works GREAT! In the beginning the game speed was very choppy but i called up their technical support and they gave my quick advice and now it is great. No more waiting for it to load or anything. I even have the older NVIDIA display chip, the NVIDIA GeForce 256 and all that i did is i went to NVIDIA.com and downloaded a newer version and now the game is great. If anyone is having trouble running their GTA3 on their computer, and your computer has at least the recommended reguirements, then you should just call up the tech support and ask them what to do. They will give you some instructions and help you out.Have fun!"
5,This Game ROCKS,"Awesome! A totally immersive world, where you can do anything you want. Fit into civilization, or go wild. I suggest having a fast computer with good graphics and good sound. Missions are great, some hard, some are not so hard. A garage where you can save your car with your game. Great stunt opportunities as you learn your way around. I made $5000 on a unique stunt bonus. This is a violent game. My favorite thing to do is, walk out into traffic, Stop a car, give the driver a bird, steal his car, get right back out of his car, and shoot him in the arm. After he has run about a block away, I like to pull out my sniper rifle and take out my aggro on his head. The visuals are great. Blood shooting 6 feet in the air until the corpse falls to the ground. Knock off a leg and watch as he hobbles around for a minute before dying. This game is like a cross between Midtown Madness and Soldier of Fortune. High blood and gore factors."
3,If Only You Could Save,"This is pretty mindless entertainment if you're looking to drive around like a maniac or occasionally stop and smack around a few people. The major drawback is that you can't save a game while ""in-mission,"" meaning it's back to square one of said mission if something goes awry, which often means hour upon hour of repeated sequences. I'm already getting tired of the game and I've only been playing now for about a month. Had there been a better save function, I would be tempted to move forward and see what happens, but playing the same scene over and over grows old fast."
5,DROOL!,"GTA III is strangely compelling. Although it works neither as an FPS (unimpressive arsenal of weapons, lacks ""Max Payne"" gritty realism, inability to enter most buildings and bad camera angles) or a driving sim (no real cars, elementary physics model), its non-linear approach is insanely compelling. Prepare to spend hours just driving around Liberty City and exploring the environment..."
4,Immersive fun,"Yes, it's not for kids. In an age of plaintive ""what about the children?"" cries, a refreshing game is released for the PC. Don't get hung up on the killing, the hookers and the suggestive cut scenes -- this can actually be nice, pleasant experience. Really. Image cruising down realistic streets in a sporty car, watching the sights and listening to your own MP3s (take that, PS2). Get bored? Take up a short mission or two. Or pick a fight with a rival gang. Or, yes, hook up with a hooker."
5,Grand Theft Auto 3: Must get if you have a good system.,"i just got Grand theft auto 3 about 4 hours ago. So i am not very far, but far enough to tell you how great this game is. This game is a must buy for MATURE people. There is alot of swearing and and violence, so if you dont like violence, don't buy it. Oh and buy they way, this game runs great on my system at 800x600x16 (never tried any higher). System specs are:Intel Celeron 1.3 GHZ384 Megs sdramVortex sound card32 meg Geforce 2 mx400 card (yes thats right Geforce 2 mx400)40 gig hard drive 7200 rpm16X dvd driveand who carez about the rest.A lot of people had alot of problems with the Geforce 2 mx400 but i have none. And i even have a [bad] celeron instead of a pentium.I would recommened at least 800 mhz 16 meg card and 128 megs of ram to run this game half descent"
1,back to the drawing board for this one!,"I thought this was going to be a cool game, I mean the idea behind it all sounds good, but the minute I poped it into my brand new 1.2 gig computer with GeForce 128bit graphics card, I then realized I have been had! This game ran so bad I cant understand why it is even being sold. I mean if you are going to sell a game, make sure it works. I have a pretty superior system to run it on, and it did not work. I can imagine how it runs on older computers. I recommend getting Half-life its a little dated now, but it will run like a gem. HitMan Codename 47 is pretty cool, great shooter. For racing get Need For Speed, I would pass this one up. I think Rockstar games better get back to the drawing board and fix this one. I know never to buy any games made by Rockstar ever again."
1,NO MULTIPLAYER!,"That's right people, no multiplayer, which makes me wonder why we waited so long to get it on PC. I'm sure the singleplayer is fine, but, frankly, I don't care. The multiplayer game in GTA2 was so great, and it looks as though GTA2 is still the best multiplayer carjacking killing-spree out there."
1,"nothing but technical conflicts, no fun","This game had so many conflicts with existing drivers on my system I never was able to play it (even though my system exceeds all recommendations and requirements stated). After spending 3 days writing exhaustive emails to so-called customer support, and downloading drivers for nearly every piece of hardware on my system, all their recommendations led up to the unsolvable error, ""GTA3 requires at least 12MB of free video memory."" I have 128MB of free video memory, but the game cannot recognize this. All my other games play with no hitches, but I will be returning this one."
2,Why Oh Why?,"Well I bought this game quite a while ago. So I installed it everything went fine and then Blamo! The game played rather poorly lagging up almost always . So I tinkered around with the graphic options and now it plays so-so. At times it still lags up for some unknown reason. It's not my computer because I'm above the recommended requirements in every category. I've played the game on the PS2 and personally I think that for playability the PS2 version is much better. The game itself is fine, but the fact that you have to deal with lag sours the deal. I've seen these problems occur on quite a few computers and no one really knows why it happens. I've contacted the tech support a few times about this, but they always give me the same answers and then stop responding to my emails. I've also seen this game play really well on a few systems too. So I guess it's a coin toss."
2,Just couldn't get into it.,"I played for several hours hoping to get hooked but I just was never able to. You get a mission, you drive around performing it, and then you get paid. You can freelance but that is even more boring. Running from the cops if fun the first few times but gets kind of old after a while.The scenery and free-flowing format is neat, but if all I want to do is drive around I can fill up my gas tank on the car three times for what the game costs and just go drive."
2,runs bad on geforce 2 mx400?,"yeah yeah. we have all heard and agreed that gta3 is a fun game to play. but one other reviewer said it runs bad on his system. he said he has a geforce 2 mx400 on an athlon xp2000 (equivelent of p4 1.7 ghz.) my computer is a p3 1 ghz with an mx400 too. i can run unreal tournament at 1600x1200 resolution, an with all the other performance eathing stuff at over 80 frames a second.one or more of the following can be true.1. the guy that wrote the other review is lying (not very likely)2. he is running gta3 on XP or 2000, which all eat up performance, so stick with windows 98.3. the makers of gta3 were very rushed to release the pc version, so they gave it a crappy, inefficient graphics engine.(i think most likely)if number three is correct, which it probably is, do not buy GTA3 because only really expensive computers can run it well.if you really want to play gta3, get it on ps2."
1,Way too demanding on the system,"The makers of this game obviously didnt even attempt to optimize it for the average computer. I own a Pentium III 700 Mhz, ATI Rage video card etc. In other words, a computer that was top of the line a year or so ago. I CANNOT RUN THIS GAME ON MY SYSTEM. Way too slow to be playable, and it is hard to believe that you'll be able to play on a 1ghz system either. So either buy a 2ghz computer or play something else instead."
5,This is the best ... game ive ever played!!!,"I have only one word for this game- FANTASTIC. ive been playing video games ever since i could hold a controller and ive been a huge fan of all the GTA series and i still play them becuase of thier gameplay and plots to them they are just genuis, then Rockstar and DMA come along with the 3rd sequel and this blows away my mind at everything you can do in this game and the whole Liberty City is amazing, they couldnt have made a better game, this game would be the only reason id buy a PS2(and for Max Payne-another Rockstar game)those guys at rockstar are genuises, they know what the poeple want and they delvier with full force."
4,A Great Primer,"I can't say that I'm a big fan of the horror/suspense genre but this collection was too intriguing to pass up. Like science fiction, horror fiction isn't ordinarily a genre associated with black writers and readers. ""Dark Dreams"" is a very good primer for the curious. While I enjoyed many of the stories contained in this volume, some really good stories, like Joy Copeland's ""Hair Story,"" suffered from unsatisfying endings while some others, like Zane's vampire landlord tale never get off the ground. The exceptions to this are ""Danger Word"" by Taranarive Due/Steven Barnes, ""Red"" by Rickey Windell George, and ""Cum Onn, It'z Lovely Whether"" by Anthony Beal. These stories, in my opinon, do not disappoint on any level. This is defintely one of those rare, strong anthologies & is worth reading."
1,100% Pure Garbage,"As I read, I wondered to myself whether or not the authors that contributed to this anthology were serious. This had to be the worst thing I have ever read. If I knew how to give it less than one star,I would. A friend previewed it for me over the phone and I was turned off then. He couldn't stop laughing and I couldn't stop shaking my head. I was mostly annoyed by Zane trying her hand at this. Her erotica isn't that great and here she is branching into new territory? This book was horrible, not horror. It is an insult to the Kings and Queens of Horror to add this book to their genre. Try again folks, and add some thought this time."
2,SHORT STORIES,"I Tried reading Dark Dreams, but Im really not into short stories, I read at least three of the stories and first off, they are not scarey and Im not into this book, I have part two and three and I doubt if I even read them."
5,It actually works,"We have a beautiful border collie. She would shed so badly that it would fill the vacuum each week and often need vacuuming more than once a week. A year or so ago it was had been very dry and her skin became dry and was flaking a bit. We started using this porduct each morning (we give in to her in a little milk and she loves it). No only did the shedding almost completely stop, her fur is much fuller and more beautiful. It really works! We are on our 4th bottle, so you have to give it time to work. It will be part of her routine from now on."
5,Excel Nutricoat Skin and Coat Liquid helps prevent itchy skin on my pet.,"I received the product punctually & in good condition. My pet has been using it for years. I suddenly could no longer find it in the stores. So,finding it here was a nice plus!"
1,Poor manual kills this game,What a waste of time! I have played this game for hundreds of hours and the complete lack of information on how to play this game makes it totally frustrating and ultimately unplayable. Yes there is a manual sold with the product but it is SO limited on information that it is really a guessing game how to play this game. Hugely disapointing.
4,Great Game,"This was the best simulator of the world where you can control your taxes, combat moves (especially where you use nuclear weapons to hit other countries), and plain out keep your country a balanced and resourceful area."
4,IS A GREAT BUY,The game is great for students of the modernworld. You can lead the mighty US or try to stay in power and hold on to Zaire. You can keep a democracy or start a dictatorship. You can sell and buy resources esential for your countries survival. You can keep a powerful army and destroy all rebels that threaten your rule. You can develope nuclear and biological weapons and take on the world.
2,"Great Concept, Bad Execution","On paper, this game was what I'd been waiting for. It is fun initially, but quickly gets old as you realize that it is very basic. War is boring, quick and unrealistic. Eventually you get bored adjusting varius sliders. It lacks depth."
5,Outstanding photography and music,"I used this dvd at work in the customer area with surround sound, and have had nothing but compliments. This dvd and the others by image products about our national parks are nothing but the best. Without narration and with music, makes it the tops."
5,"Very different, but VERY fun!","This version of Clue is very different, but a lot of fun! You don't have cards, but instead you have cameras, and markers as you try to catch an art thief through a art museum. You ask questions like ""Is camera, 2 on?"" and so on. The thief can even turn off cameras, and cut wires. It sounds kind of boring, and this game is really ""old school"" it doesn't talk, etc. but it's really a lot of fun! Like my other Master Clue review, this game was only at Children's Palace too, so I think this one is also ""unknown""."
3,Not from Peachtree,"The description is not accurate. Although ""Electricity"" is included on some special european editions of 2004's Peachtree Road, this is actually a brand new tune Elton did for the Billy Elliot musical, based on the movie, which premiered in London recently. It hasn't grown on me yet, but some folks seem to like it a lot."
1,I hated it.,"This book is an insult to everyone of the millions of American workers who support unions. An unfair, inaccurate, unbalanced, distorted portrayal of a movement that deserves the support of every thinking American. Read Mobsters, Unions and Feds for a balanced account of the same matrerial."
1,"Erie Mining Co, Train Set Review.",I have most if not all of the Microsoft Train Simulator supplements. I like all the others very much. This is the first one I found inadequate. I installed it twice just to make sure I had not erred. There are only three activities. Each starts one place and ends at another with nothing in between. There are no Mileposts or scenery except trees. It takes a long time to get from one end to the other ... perhaps an hour ... with nothing to do but watch trees go by. It seems that this supplement was not developed to anything near what the others are. I think it is a waste of time and money.
5,Gardena Vario sprinkler,"This is an excellent sprinkler for medium size areas, such as 50' x 50'.Gardena as usual, has given carefull thought to their product.It produces a uniform spray pattern acoss it's diameter and the water droppletsare small, so they don't damage any folliage."
1,Disappointed,"Gardena Circular Sprinkler Vario/Sled #31948-5I've been using Gardena products for well over twelve years. During that time I have never been disappointed by any of thier products. Not until now. I am completely disappointed with the performance of this product. After about 10 to 15 minutes of use, the sprinkler stops spinning and only sprays water in the same direction, soaking the same portions of the lawn. I disassembled and reassembled it. I ran it with and without the filter. I altered the pressure (volume) of the hose. I tried the different settings. All to no avail. The product just doesn't do what Gardena claims. I hope it's the nature of the item and not the product. If I knew how to return or exchange it, I would do so in a heart beat. Since I purchased through Amazon, I'm not at all sure of the return process. It's in my gargage getting dusty."
1,Gardena's worst sprinkler,"I've been using Gardena sprinklers for years and years. They've always been outstanding products. Though many folks are turned off by their high prices and plastic construction, I find them to be long-lasting and well engineered. However, THIS one is horribly engineered. It's extremely hard to set up without getting soaked. While is it very adjustable from 1/4 to a full circle -- it's near impossible to tell where the water is going to come out. Unfortunately, even after this painful set up, you'll find the spinning action to be extremely inconsistent and very dependent on the pressure supplied. What's worse, I was never able to find a pressure at which the thing provided good, even coverage. Skip this one!"
4,Good but pricey,"This sprinkler has nice adjustment features, and is weighted, so it stays where you put it. Recommended"
2,Opinion,This book can be a little hard to read. The writing style is somewhat academic and impersonal.
3,Good idea -- weak technology,"We have a large heavily shaded yard that requires considerable watering over the summer. We have three of these computers running with multiple water lines feeding out from each. This is a terffic idea if you have a lot of regular watering to do -- and, it really saves you loads of time. Unfortunately, for two of the past three years we've had to replace at least two computers. In fact, we're ordering two water computers today. I just wish they built them to stand up for more than a year or two."
2,an astonishingly convoluted device,"The Gardena Water Computer is an astonishingly convoluted device that performs an otherwise simple task. The programming methods seem to best serve the engineering requirements of Gardena and not typical home gardeners. The English section of the instructions were likely not written by a native English speaker - making deployment of the timer ever more complicated. After several attempts that consumer several precious weekend hours I was finally able to link the computer with a Gardena Rain Sensor and a Gardena Water Distributor. Overall, it simply was not worth my time, and because of Amazon's requirement that a product must be unused to be returned, I have to live with it."
2,Good title but....,I am a teacher and book lover. I bought this book and found it very disappointing. I think that 4 yr olds need books to get to the heart of the story quickly and simply. This story does neither. It is long/ wordy and provides way to much information to be grasped by young children. I like the title and wish the author had simply answered her own question.
3,"middling, but ""sometimes"" is a winner","""sometimes"" is deliciously overwrought and insidiously catchy. ""i'm caught in the back of my own throat / i'm lost in the void between the instinct and the execution..."" the rest of ""dark dancer"" is hit or miss-- retro 80's sounds with some funky aspect, but if you're looking for daft punk keep looking."
5,5 Stars Plus+++++,"Henry Fonda's performance as Clarence Darrow was groundbreaking theatre. Any actor, who can hold the attention of two thousand people for two hours deserves attention. I had the honor of seeing Mr. Fonda's performance live from the front row meaaznine of the Minskoff Theatre in New York. The performance I found riveting in person has lost none of the electricity, for me, in the transformation to video.This VHS is a must see for any student of the craft of acting. You will NEVER see the like of this again."
5,Henry Fonda as Clarence Darrow,"CORRECTION:The television version (1974), also titled, ""Clarence Darrow Starring Henry Fonda,"" ""Henry Fonda as Clarence Darrow,"" and ""Clarence Darrow."" was directed by John Rich, (Emmy award winning director of Dick Van Dyke and All in the Family.)"
1,There are better sets out there,"My in-laws gave this to my 2-yr old daughter. The stethoscope made a lot of noise, often going off for no reason with the sound of a baby, rather than a beating heart, which I probably wouldn't have minded as much. I put that part of it away from the set early. But what bothered me most about this set was that the paint comes off of it. My daughter often put the little bottle in her own mouth, as well as the thermometer, and I noticed within a very short period of time that the paint was coming off.There are lots of doctor sets out there. This is definitely not one of the better ones to choose."
4,Identical to Fisher Price Little Mommy Set,Different colors but otherwise same noises same pieces with 2 differences. The fisher price set includes a clip board and the bag is not fabric.I purchased the other for $12 and while a laughing baby sound on the stethoscope is goofy. I tell my daughter her heart is happy.
5,Fine Form and Funny,"The late George Johnston is one of Canada's most under-rated poets. His poems (of which this book contains every one printed in book form) are often fun, but never lite, and he does things with syntax and form that will delight the reader and fill any poet serious about the craft with envy."
1,A Life in Decoration by Keith Irvine,"Very dissapointing!!! Many of the design photos are dated, and the quality of the printing is fuzzy on many pages. I must own at least 75 Interior Design books spanning 30 years and THIS is the first book I have ever returned!!! There was nothing in it to make me ever look atit again!!! Definitely not worth the price (to me). W O'M"
3,A Life in Name-Dropping!,"I have to agree with another reviewer: many of the photos are of poor quality and quite a few have been published before in HOUSE & GARDEN. I must also take exception to the numerous self-aggrandizing remarks Irvine sprinkles everywhere in the book -- Humble he is Not! As for the Irvine style of decoration, I find it a bit overwrought with an excess of pillow & Brunschwig print. Still, I would much rather look at Mr Irvine's baroque interiors than Kelly Wearstler's quite loony creations -- ""Hey, what about this nice 3000 yr old bristlecone pine as a table centerepiece?"" Eck."
5,Lois Does It Again!!!,"Those of you unfamiliar with Lois Greiman's previous works, her ""Highland"" trilogy in particular, are in for a wonderful treat with The Lady and the Knight. Not only will you laugh and sigh and cry, you will be searching out the rest of the Forbes clan as quickly as you can!! Let me be of assistance--Highland Jewel, Highland Flame and Highland Wolf.Ms. Greiman has a sense of humor that will leave you smiling long after you've turned the pages and an extraordinary gift for breathing life into all her characters--from the swaggering hero and determined heroine to the wary children and a mischievous goat. (You'll have to read it. I'm not telling. <g>) Have fun!!!"
3,LADY AND THE KNIGHT,"I ENJOYED THE HIGHLAND BRIDE SERIES, HOWEVER BY THE LAST ONE THEY WERE ALL FRUSTRATINGLY,THE SAME STORY. WEAK MEN, STRONGER WOMEN."
1,A Piece of JUNK!,"The first reviewer complained that his connector broke after one season. I'll go one better......mine broke after one use!It worked fine for the first few minutes [so it wasn't broke when we bought it], but then we noticed the main connecting head [the one that connects to the faucet] began to leak. When we looked closer, we realized that the main head had cracked right down the middle!We returned the connector, and bought one made of metal. It works great.The moral of this story is, when it comes to hose adaptors, stay away from PLASTIC!"
3,Gardena Twin-Tap Connector #31212-4,BOUGHT 2 OF THESE Gardena Twin-Tap Connector #31212-4. RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX CONNECTS EASILY. LEAKS SOME AT VALVES....
1,DO NOT SUPPORT MADACY HOME VIDEO/DVD,Another reviewer states that these are uncut episodes...NOT TRUE! At least 5 minutes have been cut from the beginning of the Jack Benny one. Madacy is the worst!!!
2,Good Graphics. Limited Appeal,"This is a game with good graphics, but limited growth and appeal. If you're spoiled by Roller Coaster Tycoon, don't expect this game to even come close. The graphics are crisp and upscale. But the game is slow to progress and confusing to control. The documentation is poor and the user is left to trial and error to figure out what's going on. Signs and symbols aren't explained well. The game appears to offer plenty of options, but the user has no idea what they are or how to use them. Expect high frustration levels that cancel out any enjoyment the game can offer."
3,Almost...,"Fun, but don't expect anymore that what you see on the box. The limitations of play are similar to those of Tropico minus the eye candy. I'd wait for this one to end up in the bargain bin before purchasing."
5,"Yo, dat butt be slammin'",LaToya proved again in 1994 that she is the only Jackson worthy of riches and fame. Watching her giggle and wrythe on her bed is more fun than making fun of Michael. She even makes the simple act of making a sandwich a tempting trip into ecstacy. I wouldn't want to be in a kitchen with anyone else. What a happy floor that must have been too. Two thumbs and one member up!
2,Factual errors spoil clever mystery,"This book is aimed at ""foodies"", those of us who love good food, good wine, and good dining. Unfortunately for Mr. King, foodies also love authenticity. He calls Hunan Province an island, thinks hot rice cake soup is uncommon and new, (we've eaten in for years in St. Louis as Sizzling Rice soup), and thinks that an American serving a prison sentence could run for President of the U.S.Mr. King's writing is pleasant, but he needs an editor!!"
2,Not impressed,"I was not very impressed by the watch. It is an original Movado, but it was way too large and the leather strap was very dingy, it looked almost like it was worn.I had to return it. Be careful and don't go by the size in the picture it is much much larger and if you have small hands like me it will not look right."
2,Less than half claimed run time!,"Ummmm, first of all, this is only 50 min. in length, not 110min. as claimed. Second, it does not really give much more than an overview of what one would hope to accomplish taking THIS LONG w/ the ""task at hand"", overall it was kind of disappointing."
5,Great for people on the go.,"Quite simply, this compact Bible gives you the complete package in a small but effective format. The words are very legible and the button flap helps protect the pages. This Bible has a thorough Concordance and center collumn references to assist you as you study. I prefer this format to traditional Study Bibles; I've found that I have a tendency to get a little lazy and depend too much on the commentary in Study Bibles.This is truely a great find for me!!"
1,So Disappointed,"I purchased one of these from Ulta and it was terrific...well-made durable. When they discontinued carrying them and I saw them online, I jumped at the chance to own a few more. Quality is terrible, not durable, and pulled at my hair when I used. Don't buy!"
1,Disappointing experience,"I owned a Gardena sprinkler which lasted over 10 years, so when it finally died I ordered this one.......not once, but twice!! In both cases, the sprinkler got stuck (would not oscillate), and not all of the nozzles worked/sprayed. Very disappointing."
5,locked threads,"weird eh? i out it on threads, it locked em, suprising how it does that being thread locker and all. good stuff."
2,Ineffective,"Not locking very well, too watery consistency. Yes, I did shakewell before using. May be the higher strength product will work better. I ended up buying another brand of threadlocker from the local hardware store and worked like magic."
5,Works well,"After a bolt broke on my lawn mower that held the handle to the base, I put my own bolt and nut on it but the nut kept vibrating loose. Used some of this on the threads and the nut hasn't come off since."
5,The Consummate Design Guidebook,"Whether you are an HR or OD professional (or a little of both), this book will become a valuable resource to you. It is filled with practical, thorough, and easy to follow methods for any practitioner involved in organization change projects. Naomi guides the reader through various stages of a change plan, explaining what needs to be done, how to do it, how to measure what you did, and how you are doing. It is this last part that I find exceptionally useful. Naomi's advice will keep you grounded in the work you are doing and instill the confidence you will need in approaching highly complex issues. I refer to this book often in my consulting practice and learn something new each time I pick it up."
3,Avoid Missteps in Organization Design,"In today's economy, organizations are in constant flux and are often redesigned in response to new challenges. Organization Design: The Collaborative Approach provides practical tools and powerful insights on how to create new organization structures for high performance while winning support and building on the expertise of executives, managers, and employees. The book provides many checklists and models that aid in identifying and reducing common mistakes which often lead to significant design or implementation failures. A first rate book!"
4,"Great, but where is the rest?","This really is a wonderful document of the concerts, with a rare live glimpse of Pete performing his music on his own terms. His guitar work is, as always, superb, and the neck-cam on ""Can You Help the One You Really Love?"" brings into focus--literally--his underrated skills as an acoustic guitarist.That said, the CDs (available on his website eelpie.com) are much better quality for not containing his false starts, forgotten lyrics, and for the best versions of almost all of the songs over the two performances. The DVD also leaves out almost all the classical compositions, as well as an absolutely wonderful version of ""Sister Disco.""The DVD is wonderful and oddly compelling, but it would've benefited from the expanded and more polished contents of the CDs."
5,Masterpiece of Art,"I cant really call this music for its beyond that, its Art, from a truly gifted Artist.This is pretty much ""Who's Next"" by Pete Townshend with full Orchestra.The songs and arrangments are amazing, sound quality is superb and the passion is a 10!I have tons and tons and tons of WHO DVD's and CD's and I must say, I enjoy this DVD the best of them all, maybe because Im getting older and the songs are so elequintly arranged sounds just great.It's sad this DVD is out of print, get it while you can."
1,Out of date but still on sale,"This may have been at one time a good guide, filling a great niche. Unfortunately at this time it is three years old. I found too many errors- specifically reviews and listings for restaurants that have closed, changed names/owners- for it to be trustworthy or even that useful. Granted, I live in the Boulder area and know most of the vegetarian restaurants here and in Denver, so I bought it to find those that I don't know of. Those listed in the guide may or may not even exist anymore."
5,Son cant put it down!,"My Son received this for his 6th birthday and hasnt stopped playing it. He really had lost interest in his gameboy for awhile, but this has rejuvenated his interest! Getting him to put it down for bed always evokes a ""Please, just 5 more minutes!"""
3,Backyard Baseball,The product was purchased for a 10 year old boy living overseas who is addicted to Gameboy. He found the game entertaining but not as fast-paced as he would prefer. It is worth the price and provides sufficient entertainment for him. It was received within the promised time in excellent condition.
4,Doesn't work with FS2004,"Copilot was a brilliant addon for FS98 - FS2002 (to use it with FS2002 requires a full install). I wouldn't have flown without it. However, it no longer works with the latest version of FS."
4,Lundberg Wild Blend,"My husband LOVES this rice - a little more than I do. I've made three cups at a time rather than the two-cup recipe so that my husband will have some left over for an evening treat or next day treat. I could do with out the ""sticks"". I know, I know, it's healthy and all that and I will continue to buy for my husband. I use Tones Chicken or Beef Base along with some Orzo and Spice Classics vegetable flakes, thereby making my own Rice-A-Roni."
4,"Great Product, BUT","This Wild Rice Blend, single bags, is very hard to find in area stores. Having to buy six bags at a time leads to some problems, ie: long term storage. I had E-mailed the producer asking the best method, twice0 but have yet to receive a reply. Wouldn't it be nice if they would in 2 bag containers????Paul Ziegelmair, FPZiegelmair@charter.net"
5,lundberg wild blend,"Very good flavor. I'll definitely buy more when I need it. I cook it in my $15 aroma rice cooker, 1/2.5 ratio rice to water. Very good with a spoonful of olive oil poured over the finished rice."
5,Great tasting and filling!,"I'm a regular when it comes to brown rice and I can honestly say this is by far the best tasting I've come across. Has a very earthy and nutty taste to it, but also semi-sweet. It's amazing and can really be a nice complement to any dish. ENJOY!"
4,Tastes good to me,"For a Great Depression baby from the lower socioeconomic class such as myself, this is a bit of self indulgence due to price. But I can rationalize that I'm helping save the earth if I accept the company's claims on the back of the package."
5,Tasty rice and good price,The rice has a very nice scent to eat. It is tasty and the quantity makes it relatively cheap. I would recommend.
4,Good product at excellent price!,"When Costco decided to stop stocking my favorite wild rice blend and then the sole amazon vendor thought that increasing the on-line cost to $22 was a good idea, I looked for a replacement. Lundberg Wild Blend fits the ticket perfectly! Great price, great taste and it comes in 6 individually sealed 16 oz bags to keep unused product fresh.Takes a little longer to prepare than my old favorite (50 mins vs 30 mins) but worth the wait!"
5,WOW. So flavorful and great texture!,"I purchased this rice blend to go along with my newly acquired rice cooker. The rest of my family prefers plain white rice, but I dig my carbs complex like wicker furniture; thus the birdseed-like package impression appealed to me.I was unprepared for how good this rice is. It needs no salt or other flavoring. Just a pat of butter or a splash of olive oil, and the lovely nutty chewy blend of this rice shines through. I may end up gifting out the rest of the packages in this order; it's too good not to share. Expect another order from me very soon."
3,Expiration date,I must admit I have not tried the rice yet: looks good.I have noticed that the product expiration date (though partially obscured) was in late September of this year: I just got it November 4.I ex[ect it to be good: but expect timely checks of exp. dates from Amazon.
1,what am i doing wrong,"i must be doing something wrong, because i think this rice is awful. i followed the instructions, but had to add more water and cook longer."
4,TV,"Got this TV for $730. See it in stores for $100 more all the time. What's not to like???? Razor sharp picture in HD, better than expected on ""regular"" tv, light as a feather, swivels. Has backlight."
4,"Samsung 42"" TV",I am very happy with this product. My brother and I bought it for my parents for Xmas - he hooked it up yesterday very easily. The quality is excellent! It was recommended by Consumers Report and I'm definitely happy with it!Deana
2,"Samsung LNT3242H 32"" LCD HDTV Review","Consumer Report magizine rated this item as a 78 overall top score equal with two other major brands. C.R. also rated the standard definition picture quality as excellent. This may be true compared to other hdtv's but, I was very dissatisfied with this feature because it is very poor quality compared to standard definition televisions! In my area I have a small handfull of cable hd stations to select from which leaves only standard definition analog and a small quantity of digital stations!"
1,TV died after 2 days - will not come back on,"I received this TV as a birthday present and used it for 2 days. On the second day, the TV went off while I was watching it and then refused to come back on. Please do not purchase this as they same may happen to you."
4,Samsung LNT3242H 32-inch LCD HDTV,Been great - Amazon shipped it right away and I have been real happy with the clarity of the tv. I also have a samsung DLP so I see the difference. This tv is the perfect tv for the bedroom.
2,Audio drop-out is a real problem!,I purchased this item after reviewing the reviews and scanning through the discussions about the audio drop-out problem. I was under the impression that Samsung had corrected the problem in sets manufactured after June 2007.Well I received my set and was pleased to see it was manufactured in August 2007. I hooked everything up and loved the picture quality and the look of the design. The first day I got one audio drop. I wrote it off to a bad handshake on the HDMI cable. Weeks went by with no problems. I kept the shipping box just in case. The 30 day return window passed last week and I tossed the box. Four days later I have such bad audio drop-outs the set is unuseable!Now I have to deal with Samsung Customer Service. I hope I have the good luck that a few others have posted and Samsung sends someone out to install new boards.
5,Great TV so far,"We were looking for a good quality flat screen TV for a wall mount. We have had the TV for a month now and still very pleased with the picture quality. I was surprised at the care in the delivery process since I worried about possible damage in shipment. They opened the package and checked to make sure that it was working. As with all electronic equipment today, the manuals describe so many things that can be done and this can be confusing to those of us who just want to watch some DVD's and HD TV once in awhile. Picture quality is what we were looking for and this TV has not disappointed us."
3,Not Real PIP,"The 42 series only offers PIP in one combination, when your main picture is your computer monitor, connected to the PC input, and your mini picture comes from the cable input. No other inputs will produce PIP. I wanted this feature very much, and was mislead by the universally inadequate features lists on all the shopping websites. Now I'm stuck with this, since I don't think its worth re-packing and shipping this monster. But, the picture is nice.I can't believe that not one of these 50 other reviews mentioned this."
2,Poor editting!,"When I saw this TV novela in Mexico, I loved the story! It's so realistic and the acting is excellent. It shows the contemporary society of Mexico in a very open way. It has topics like: infidelity & double life, divorce, aids, breast cancer, the love affair between Maria (50 year old) and Alejandro (ten years younger than her)and how the family can overcome all this life challenges. I love the strength of Maria! It's just that the editting is so poor! I paid 70 dlls for this novela and I'm so dissapointed! It gets so many cuts that it is impossible to follow by someone who has never seen it before!I suggest they could do another version with not so many edditing, maybe 12 to 14 hours of TV novela! And if possible, it would be great to have it with English subtitles. I know many people in Montreal area who would like to see it and they do not speak Spanish, they have seen it before in Rumania, the Russia, Israel!"
2,good service bad version...choppy cut scenes...,"I love ""Mirada de Mujer"" , but this version is to choppy. I know is a resume hello is just 5 dvds, but seriously they cut to much! Key point conversations gone. Its like watching a 60 min teaser in each DVD."
3,Packaging over selection,"As a huge fan of Ramones I cannot give an unbias opinion of this C.D. The compilation probably could""ve been better, though The Japanese rarely fail to please. The quality of the packaging is second to none & the stickers will be fairly collectable one'd imagine.ramone9t6@yahoo.com"
3,Mania 2 - Brain Drain,"My main problem with ""Mania 2"" is the absence of anything from ""Brain Drain"". Have people in Japan never heard ""Pet Semetary"" or ""I Believe In Miracles""? Other than that it's a decent overview of what most fans would call their least good (I didn't want to say ""worst"") albums. Since there are other comps out there now that are cheaper, the only real reason you would want this is to collect everything, or both ""Mania""s. The first one is still my favorite, at least until they put out a ""Punk"" best of, with just songs like ""The Crusher"", ""Cabbies On Crack"", ""Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment"", etc. Does anybody else think it's weird that Johnny would choose ""Rock & Roll Radio"" to be on ""Loud, Fast Ramones""? I thought he would've hated that song."
3,nothin like # 1,I stongly disagree that the first Mania album wasnt very good. Its one of my favorite cds out of my Ramones collection. However I feel that #2 doesnt have near as good of a selection of songs although they are good covers they just dont rock along like the songs on the first Mania. Personally I would have done without the 2nd Mania album all together.
2,Bad Choice,"The first 'Ramones Mania' was not a very well-thought out collection, but it did feature most of the band's best songs. This second volume fills in the gaps but has mostly just lesser material to work with. And if you want the best of the Ramones on two CDs, the two 'Ramones Mania' volumes are not the ones you want - 'Anthology' is a near definitive double-disc set that summarizes their career perfectly. Skip this & it's first volume, they're not very good."
5,Wonderful introduction to learning Spanish,"Two of my children who recently started studying Spanish, fell in love with this Picture Book Dictionary. Unlike some of the other rather dull children dictionaries, this book retains my kid's attention for long periods of time! They like its clear, concise phrases, supported by interesting and engaging illustrations. Examples, given in this book, are very user-friendly, so learning Spanish becomes interesting and fun. I am sure that parents who want their children to make rapid progress in studying Spanish, would be as happy with Valerie Laud's Picture Book Dictionary, as we are. Thank you, Valerie!"
2,Have it but have not read it yet.,Sorry this is a poor review. I have soo many books and have not had a chance to read this one yet. Sorry!!!
5,This Disk Captures the Energy,"I was present at Feinstein's at the Regency in New York City for the show that is recorded here. This disk captures the energy that pervaded the room. Keely was in great voice and had a great rapport with the audience. This disk has it all: high energy Louis Prima arrangements tightly played by great New York sidemen (including saxman Jerry Vivino playing the Sam Butera parts and drummer Joe Cocuzzo), luscious sweetly-sung ballads, and nice-as-can-be Keely interacting with the audience. Sitting inches away from Keely and just feet from a band that blew the roof off, this was one of the great musical nights of my life. Amazingly, this disk captures the experience. The only things missing are the delicious lamb chops I ordered that night."
4,A Light and Funny Read but also a lot of Vulgarity,"I chose this novel as a light, funny, gay-themed read for before bedtime / winding down the day reading. It is light and funny but not politically correct - there is a lot of vulgarity in the words and actions. Some of it is funny. Some of it is pathetic. The author has a good sense of plot but basic things like spelling and syntax are poor. The book had a lot of typos in it too. I agree with the reviewer, this author needs to not quit his day job. Although I would probably read a second novel if he has the nerve for it."
1,A Piece of Crap,"This is one of the worst novels I've ever read. Don't waste your time and money. I sincerely hope this author is never again allowed to publish a novel. Graydove, the main character, is completely pretentious and arrogant, you'll hate him from the start. The rest of the characters are stereotypes and/or completely uninteresting. The author's attempts at jokes are weak, trite and corny. Not funny at all. He also has an annoying habit of inserting jokes at inappropriate points in the plot. A joke will suddenly pop up in a spot where it makes no sense. The plot is dull, uninspired and boring. I picked this up becaused it looked like a really unique and amusing story. Instead, the corny jokes, lame plot and terrible characters made for a miserable reading experience. Save yourself the grief and skip this one. Hopefully, the author will stick to anchoring television shows in the future."
1,Framesi silis,"DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT-I had a professional salon in NJ use this product on my hair. They promised me my frizzy hair would be shiny, straight, frizz free and shiny. Instead my hair was burnt and badly damaged. In addition, I had bald patches due to harsh nature of this product. Not sure how other women had great results and it could have been the salon but they claim they used the product hundreds of times. DO NOT TAKE A CHANCE AND END UP MISERABLE LIKE ME."
5,WAOW,"For people who do not have time to go to school or do not have the ability to stay in a class of a lot of people, it is for you. It is your personal teacher that works on your own pace. JUST TRY IT!!!!"
4,Hard to learn from,"I don't think this book is intended to be a self-contained text used to learn everything about traffic modeling. The order in which the material is presented is not perfect and there are some errors. It tries to provide a high level summary of a lot of the traffic modeling papers. However, the book is readable and is a good starting point if you want to see if this research area interests you. After reading this book you will need to dig further; but that's research.Overall a good book."
1,MEN that think outside the box,"This is a collection of stories primarily written by men. Of thirty or so stories, four were stories by women- 2 athletes, 2 artists: No women leaders or scientists. Pitiful. Some stories are interesting, some one note. Take this book out of the library to check out some of the stories, and review the reference section in the back which talks about different programs for children - camps, etc. - by interest. I wish I hadn't been responsible for cutting down a tree to print the copy I bought on Amazon. Waste of resources."
2,"Poorly edited, thin on content","It is hard to overlook the basic errors in this book. A simple copyedit would have caught them, but apparently nobody bothered with that.The book contains some interesting stories from very accomplished people, but few of them offer much insight into the person's childhood, and what motivated them to become who they are. It is rarely clear how they thought outside the box as kids. Mostly the people profiled say ""reach for the stars,"" ""never quit,"" etc. The author herself does not contribute any more insight.Save your money."
1,Waste of Money,"This book is an embarrassment to its author, its publisher, and its contributors. Unprofessional in the extreme, it has more errors of punctuation, grammar, and spelling than the moon has craters. Despite the pain of wading through the wretchedly incompetent prose, I kept reading in the hope of finding some worthwhile insights, and here as well the book was remarkably disappointing. Lerner promises far more insight than she is able to deliver. The narratives contributed by high achievers occasionally make for interesting reading despite their lack of professionalism, but they rarely offer anything beyond the obvious regarding nurturance of children's talents. I strongly advise parents seeking guidance to look elsewhere."
1,Poor game control / OK Graphics,"I had a hard time playing Project Earth. The game control is no way near as good as Homeworld or Homeworld Cataclysm. One has to use the mouse & arrow keys & ctrl key to get anything done. In the end the controls are not intutive and take the fun out the game. He graphics are OK. If you have not played Homeworld or Homeworld Cataclysm I would recommend that you buy them instead. They have easy game control, good graphics & music and a great story line."
1,I wish I could get it to work,"I can't comment on game play or graphics, music, anything. So is it fair to give it a one star review, who knows. I bought this game when it first came out and never got it to work, tried loading patches but the support was next to useless and consequently I forgot about it. Found it again a couple of weeks ago and installed it on my current PC. Still couldn't get it to work. Perhaps it was a faulty disc. I would love to play it. I have played all the incarnations of Homeworld, Hegemonia legions of iron, Conquest Frontier Wars, Nexus the Jupiter incident, so I like this type of game. If I knew how to get a version that worked I wouild do it in an instant. Oh well.The best I can do for prospective buyers is recommend the few Youtube videos that are out there that feature the game. Hopefully it will work for you."
3,"Great to look at, if your not in a hurry","This game lives up to its pre-release billing. All of the previews I have read make a big deal over the graphics engine and the effects. The game is very impressive to look at, once it finally loads. Now I don't have the fastest system (PIII 700, 384 MB Ram, Radeon 8500 video), but takes at least six to seven minutes to load a mission. I feel the developer could have spent more time on the user interface. I find the ""camera"" controls cumbersome, far less intuitive than say, Homeworld, or other RTS's. Wonderful to behold, not so wonderful to play."
3,small and simple,"Like all of Coughlan's camping products this is pretty good and a pretty good price. It's very small and simple. It's design might allow one spice to come undone while you are tightening loosening the other, but I didn't have anything better before I bought it and still like it opening issues aside, due to it's size. Good for 1 or 2 for a few days of daily cooking or a small group for a day."
2,NOT WATER RESISTANT,"I was happy with the price on this item and it is not hard to fill. I carry it in my lunch box, and I find that the dampness in the box gets into the salt and pepper and clumps it into a mush. I've had to seal the shaker into a small zip-lock plastic in order to keep it usable."
1,This pedal is not for me,"I bought this pedal because it seemed like a good deal and it got positive reviews. After testing out the first one I thought it was defective and tested the replacement that Gibraltar sent then realized its just poorly made. The bearings on the main shafts are entirely too loose and the joint at the heel has an 1/8"" of play in it making this the noisiest pedal I have ever played on. You certainly could not record with this thing, it's way too noisy. With everything being so loose it does not feel sturdy.If you are playing big rooms with a loud stage and don't want to shell out for an iron cobra you can get by with this one. I'll stick to my tama iron cobra and pearl power shifter."
1,WRONG PHOTO,The photo shown is the Avenger II! That is not the 6611DB. make sure you know that before you order!!
4,guilty pleasure,I had seen Michael Bolton on a Palladia segment recently and realized that I needed to see more of him. I ordered this for myself but allowed my fiance to give it to me for my birthday. I had a hard time waiting two weeks to watch it. I spent the first part of my day blasting it throught the surround sound speakers and Im sure the whole neighborhood heard him as well. A great way to spend almost three hours.
5,Top quality video and audio.,"The vocals are excellent and also his large band as well. The High Definition video and Dolby 5.1 sound is about as good as it gets. Many cameras were used to thoroughly capture this great concert.A very good mix of some 'Vintage' songs, old 'Classics' and his popular cuts. This is probably Michael captured at his BEST."
2,all dvd functions do not work-works in stereo only!,"This concert sounds good in stereo and looks good, too. Unfortunately, all DVD functions do not work. I tried many times to get this to work as far as any function like selecting dts,etc. It would only play in stereo, which is a shame. It did sound fairly good in stereo, but that was not what i bought this for. I have a 8.1 home theater system and I had hoped for more than just stereo. The player that would only play in stereo is a brand new Oppo BDP-SE top of the line SACD/Bluray player. It has done well with all other discs, but this one. My other player is a lap top entertainment pc HP dv7. It refused to play it at all, saying I needed to put a disc in. I do like a lot of Michael Bolton's songs and have many concerts from Royal Albert Hall, so was looking forward to this one."
5,michael bolton at his best,An amazing man with a great talent anyone that loves this man's voice should enjoy his love and passion for his music and the way he is able to connect with his audience but l felt that he was not as relaxed mentally as l have seen him on other dvds etc. but still a wonderful concert.
1,Booda Super 8,"This toy was given to our American Pitbull Terrier for Christmas TODAY, 12/25/11 and in a matter of 10 minutes the thing broke!!!!! JUNK toy, don't spend your money, it came apart from one end and now it's useless."
3,"Good..but not as good as ""Pat Cooper, You're Always Yelling""","I bought ""On Location With Pat Cooper"" because of how much I loved ""Pat Cooper, You're Always Yelling"" (see my review for ""Pat Cooper, You're Always Yelling""). My first impression was that this dvd was more ""dated"" than ""...Yelling"". Also, much of Cooper's material on this dvd is also on ...""Yelling"" and the little there was that was different on this dvd was really not as funny perhaps because it is so dated. Buy ""On Location with Pat Cooper"" only if you are a Pat Cooper fan like me who just can't get enough of his extremely funny comedic genius of growing up and being Italian."
4,Almost a perfect expansion,"The expansion is almost perfect. The added tourist attactions and, military bases and industries are perfect additions. I love the addition of Spring Break tourists and the fact that they can riot if too drunk. The eco-tourist addition is also nice for all of the ""tree-hugger"" players. Being able to rotate the buildings now is great as well. Hurricanes can do great damage to your island and add a new challenge to the game. However there are two crucial elements that make this expansion not perfect. First, WHY ARE THERE NO MODES OF TRANSPRTATION? At the very least there could have been busses for the people and jeeps for the military. Perhaps even beat-up 50s style cars for the. people. The second thing that would be perfect is if there was, how shall i say, a way to change the farms to make a more profitable but dangerous type of crop?? ALl in all though a great expansion to TROPICO. (The added music is cool too)"
4,great float,"I am very pleased with this float. My son loves it and it is cute, sturdy and durable. It was not at all hard to put together and there are only a few pieces needed to put it together. The only thing that disappointed me was that when we got it there was no horn. It appears that Swimways discontinued the boat seen in its ads and pictures with a very similar, red boat. The canopy is different and the new model does not have a horn."
3,A bit difficult to keep a child's interest,"Though I felt the story was quite lovely and enjoyable, my 5 & 6 year old daughters didn't follow it very closely. A lot of time was spent discussing each page and what was happening... simply because the story is only the main characters dialogue. If your child reads this book by themselves, they may understand and follow it better... I'm not quite sure. However, this is not a great book to read TO your children, unless you want to spend a lot more time discussing what is happening. My girls were quick to say, ""let's read something else next time."" So, I'm afraid it wasn't enough for them. The illusrations are absolutely beautiful, and we did enjoy looking at the details of the pictures."
3,Grayson Hall at her best...,"This Movie is a real treat for any fans of Grayson Hall. She is a raspy voiced, lesbian night club owner named Pepi in this flick. Grayson's acting is suprisingly really superb, and not overacted. She is in more scenes than I expected. This is a cheesy kitschy treat for those is search of vintage Grayson. The other actors did a fine job too. It is low budget, but worth a view. The vintage s&m / erotica film shorts on this disc were an interesting surprise too."
5,Couldn't Have Said it Better Myself!!,"Once again, Terry Taylor and crew have shown that despite the odd, the twisted, and incredibly strange sense of humor, that they actually have a better grip on reality than most of us. Musically, they are a tight tight band. However, like their lyrics, the music is very... odd."
1,This is a BAD choice for me,"I ordered the book and read it. I think that the book is not good for any ASP programmer. First, it is not complete. For example, it didn't cover server.transfer, which is an excellent feature in ASP 3.0. Second, the description about ADO is so simple that I cannot get any idea about ADO.Why did I buy it? It is cheap and heavy. Another reason was the other users' review. Based on my experience, I suggest you to avoid this book as either study material or reference."
5,Works for 2 players and up!!,Not sure why someone had difficulty when playing with only 4 players... I have played with two players many times and still caught Mr. X! I'd say whoever they had playing Mr. X was perhaps just too clever for the rest of them...
4,Scotland Yard,"I think I will like it, if I ever get to play it.People should enjoy board games moreoften, like it was in my day."
3,Fun but limited,"This game is a great ""chase"" game, however it's not really anywhere close to a mystery/""Clue"" type game. It's more of a race where you're trying to move your gamepiece as quick and far as possible to catch Mr X. The more players the better, because it's hard to corner Mr X when there's just 2 or 3 of you chasing him on the big game board. Not too much strategy involved, but it's still fun. Keep in mind we were 20+ years old so I imagine younger kids might have more fun with it :) Still a good game worth trying, and the board/pieces are very durable and high quality!"
2,Good idea - but dull in practice for less than 6 people,"This game does not work with less than 6 players - playing as a family of 4 over the Xmas & New Year holidays we found that the detectives simply cannot move fast enough to catch the mystery person, and it quickly becomes rather tedious."
2,"Boring, unwinnable game",This game is boring and unwinnable if you play with only 4 people. Don't waste your time. It's too complex and is only meant for a huge crowd.
5,A blast from the past,"I loved this game as a kid and since my nephew would be 10 this year, I purchased for him this past Christmas. He LOVES it! It is just as I remembered - and now it includes a hat to hide Mr. X's eyes - so the other platers cannot see where he is looking. A great game for the adventurous gaming family."
4,Costs quite a bit but good,"My only problem with Scotland Yard is the price. It's ridiculously expensive. I just don't get it. I got it at the store for cheaper, but it was still expensive. Wish I kept the one I had from childhood."
4,fabulous family fun,"Excellent for teaching children to collaborate as a team, great for a variety of ages and yet adults are also challenged."
3,Like Chess only with more moves - that you can't see,"We may be playing this wrong - strategizing too much, making it last too long. We enjoyed it but did not find it to be a fast moving game. The criminal is almost un-catchable because there are so many moves he can make - frustrating to the detectives and nerve-wracking to Mr.X.After playing a few times, we all agree, without a lucky move, the detectives are lost. There were only 5 of us - maybe 6 adult players would have a better chance.The board is great, lots to look at and the premise is sound and we did have fun but I'm not sure it is worth the price."
4,Love the new cap!,"The game is a blast to play and naturally rewards cooperative play. I had the older version of this game and after it was lost, I had to get the new version. While I miss the styling of the old game board, I love the new Mr. X baseball cap that comes with it. Folks may not want to share hair cooties using a common cap so it is best for players to bring their own."
1,Wrong Population Data Equals Wrong Hypotheses,"Wow! All demographic studies are based on population data. But this book is continually wrong in the most basic demographics! Throughout the book the authors state that the ""the population of the United States was in a slow decline throughout the nineteenth century Births and immigration combined were failing to create the numbers necessary for simple replacement ..."" Wrong! Try US Census or other historic data and look at the dramatic growth through both births and immigration! The U.S. population doubled four times between 1900 and 1900! This mistake begins on page 14 and is consistently repeated. Where are the editors? If the editors and authors are not just unfamiliar but absolutely wrong about population basics, why bother with the book? See Jim Pruitt's review below for other valuable comments."
4,Useful for dealing with today's mined workplace,"Whether you are the manager or the managed, today's workplace has some unusual demands in terms of generation conflict and change. In many ways, older workers feel slighted when their experience is discounted in the face of the technical expertise of younger workers. At the same time, younger workers make big mistakes when they rush ahead without considering that experience and what it can bring to the success of a diverse team. This book gives some good ideas for understanding what generations mean in terms of workplace cohesiveness -- or the lack thereof."
4,GREAT MEMORIES,"As a 30 Something year old father, it was great to stroll down memory lane with Fat Albert's Halloween Special. I remember this more than the other holiday specials from Fat Albert. My son now enjoys it, although I suppose the whole ""Fat"" Albert thing is a bit politically incorrect in 2005. Not that it has stopped me from purchasing it. Not too many extras on this DVD. A lame game that even my 4 year old figured out how to master after the first couple of tries. That is the reason for the 4 out of 5 stars. ""Your like School on a Saturday.....No CLASS......"""
5,We need a little Fat Albert at Christmas,"This is a beautiful story about how Fat Albert and the gang extend a helpful hand and the use of their treasured clubhouse (which is about to be torn down by skinflint Tyrone) to a poor family expecting a baby at Christmas. Those of you familiar with the original Fat Albert will know what you're getting: funny one-liners, solid animation, a great storyline and a morally-uplifting (though far from self-righteous) tale, along with a massive dose of Bill Cosby, who plays a lot of roles. Those who don't are really missing out!""Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids"" was one of my favorite cartoons when I was a youngster, and I'm a white male. It's really a shame that this show or one like it isn't on today, because our society needs the messages that Cosby was conveying to black youth."
4,"Good, Clean Restored Image and Sound","This edition of Fat Albert's 10-31- 1977 Halloween special has been nicely restored, with bright colors and hiss free sound.The DVD also contains 2 bonus episodes: ""The Prankster"" from 11-18-1972, and ""The Jinx"" from 4-27-1985.The animation and humor is dated and preachy, but is just a product of its time."
2,Tumble Light,Tumblelyte was light in support. I would have liked more description as to the material it was made of. I found the shoe to be very wide across the front of the shoe. I ordered 2 different sizes and neither one worked. Wish it did!
2,ehh,"Wolo 336 Juke Box HornIt wont play a song back to back, the songs only last about 7-10 seconds so you have to keep pushing the button. You can play all the songs in a row but there is one that has horse sounds and its really uncomfortable. Sounds like the horse is crying, it makes me cringe. You get what you pay for.Also it doesn't go very loud and if you turn it all the way up it sounds all crackly like the speaker is gonna blow or something."
3,car music horn,It mounts under hood and you need to run wires thru firewall.I would love a wireless unit with more selections and a louder speaker-sometimes difficult to hear the tunes
4,Excellent bag for the price,"For $11 this gun bag/rug is a really good value if it fits your firearm. Construction is pretty good for the price and overall the bag seems quite sturdy. If you wish to lock the bag there is a loop of fabric that gives you the ability run a lock through the zipper and loop (offers some minimal level of security for your gun as you can obviously cut/hack the bag open given time).Initially I thought that this bag was too small for my S&W; 22A-1 but as it turns out it is just about right. After mounting aTruglo Red-Dot Open Dual Color Sight, BlackI am actually still able to fit my 22A-1 in the bag without any trouble. That was a huge surprise to me. Additionally the bag with gun fits nicely into myMaxpedition Sitka Gearslinger."
3,"Too long, just tall enough","I bought this to hold my Colt 01980XSE, a 1911 pistol with a 5 inch barrel. It fits, but the size/shape of the bag is wrong for this kind of pistol, in my opinion. To fit a full sized 1911, it could be about 3 inches less on the long side, and it wouldn't hurt to be a inch more on the short side.I could see it being a tight fit with an extended 10-rd magazine. Yet it is a good three inches or more longer than the gun. The bag is 15"" long and just fits inside my range bag. It doesn't fit inside my small gun safe. I know there are guns this long, but they are not mainstream. The next smaller version seemed like it would be too small. This one's OK. It just doesn't fill all the needs I hoped for. A good reason to buy in a gun shop, rather than online."
2,Made in China,"This product turned out to be a disappointment for me. I expected Uncle Mike's products to be made in the USA. To my surprise, the product is made in China. That being said, there is virtually no difference from the previous Uncle Mike's gun rugs."
2,"Unrealistic , fuzzy charatcer depth..don't bother buying it","Nan Ryan is usually one of my favorite authors but I was disappointed with her new book, The Seduction of Ellen. The characters wer one-dimensional and boring. The love scenes, which are usually a Ryan specialty, were phony and even downright perverted at some parts. The details were scare and I often shook my head in incredulousness at the plot. If you want a good historical romance, this isn't the book to get. Try another Nan Ryan novel such as ""Wanting You""."
2,leaking after 1 year,"I have had this hose connector for 1 year, and it is now leaking from a hole in the seam, I would recommend trying metal instead. I am going to get the metal one and hope it works."
1,worthless,i actually bought this stuff from GNC. Well i took 2 pills of it and an hour later.... I FELT NOTHING! i wont buy another bottle. no effects whatsoever
1,not authoritative,"I couldn't read past the first chapter. Phil and George, Producers of hits at a similar point in time, yes. But beyond that, comparisons between the two - David toggles back and forth between the similarities and ""connection"" between them - well, there is really very little to compare. Each deserves his own section of a book.Perhaps it's because I am a linear thinker - I like to process one thing at a time. Perhaps also it's because I am a recording engineer and have spent a lifetime in this biz, but people who have not spent time recording and mixing - as I suspect David has not - should not write about the technical aspects of recording without a technical editor at the ready."
2,Mall Tycoon,"Okay, I don't have this game. But! I went over to a friend's house, and she had just gotten it. So she started to play it, and I watched her. Well, just from watching her playing it, here's my opinion about it....Pros: You can run a mallYou can make your mall to be 3 stories tallCons: It runs extremely slowYou can zoom out, but then when you zoom back in, you must wait for all of the stores to regenerate their picturesGraphics are bad (The people don't walk, they have Barbie Feet!(Barbie Feet meaning that the legs don't open and close, the just skim across the floor))This is my opinion! You may want to go and check it out for yourself. Thanx!"
1,GREAT IDEA - HORRIBLE GAME,"When I first saw this game, I was VERY excited. The idea of creating my own mall was like a dream come true. Once I got it, it turned into a nightmare. The graphics are horrible. You can't do anything with the people like you can in Roller Coaster Tycoon. The options are very limited and I can think of a better way to spend [my money]. ... Save your money!!!!!"
3,"Not Horrible, but...","Okay, so, it's not horrible, but there's not much point in it. Of course, I used a cheat so I could have all the money I wanted.What you do is build a mall with different shops and such. Not much else. So, you see, it's probably a waiste of money and time. Not worth it."
1,Would not buy again..................,"This game really stunk in the graphic's area....the people look like blobs, and mostly just float across the rooms. My two year old could have done a better job creating this game than whoever did...Do not buy unless you just really want to be bored and frustrated..."
1,A bad game of a good idea...,"Okay. Poor graphics, and very difficult to figure out. Need I say more?"
1,this game stinks,"OK!(...) SEE I JUST GOT THIS GAME AND I HAVE NO CLUE ON WHAT TO DO!(...) I KNOW I NEED TO PICK UP TRASH, BUT HOW!(...) I BOUGHT THIS GAME A WALMART AND IT WAS JUST IN A CD CASE AND IT HAD NO INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO PLAY IT ONLY HAD INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO INSTALL AND UNINSTALLING IT!(...)I MEAN I'M SOO CONFUSED!(...) I WISH I COULD OF GOT A BETTER GAME!(...) I DO NOT RECOMOND THIS GAME TO OTHERS!(...) WELL THATS JUST MY IDEA, BUT TAKE MY WORD DO NOT GET MALL TYCOON!(...)"
1,No where near Roller Coaster quality,My sister got this game for me after she saw my addictive nature towards Roller Coaster Tycoon. I opened it up and thought the package had been mislabeled....well maybe not that bad but the graphics were antique and the basic functions of the game did not challenge you AT ALL!!! If you have a child 6-10 then maybe they would enjoy it but I doubt that it will hold their attention for long. The concept is full of holes. There is NO room for any creativity. I was very disappointed!
1,Worst Tycoon Game Ever!,"Last Christmas, I was going to get Zoo Tycoon, but when my mom went to the store, they didnt have any left so she bought this Mall Tycoon. It looked so cool on the cover that I installed it immediately. Turns out it looks nothing like it does on the cover. The walls are all weird red and pink colors and the floor is rainbow. It looks horrible! The people don't even look like they buy anything. In Roller Coaster Tycoon, when you see someone go up to a stall, they leave holding popcorn or a balloon! In Mall Tycoon, they held nothing! Even though it said they bought something. It's the worst game ever. I wouldn't even give it 1 star, but Amazon wouldn't let me. So please, save your money and buy some other tycoon game!"
1,Not compatible with Win 95,"The description says this game is compatible with Windows 95, but in fact you need 98 or later and a pentium II 300 mhz processor."
2,Big Disappointment,"This games states on the box that it works with XP, but don't believe it. It constantly freezes and boots you out. Fortunately if you have autosave on, you can restore. Their is no real instruction, you have to learn by Hit or Miss...You can't tell what the people are thinking, employees somehow get trapped and all you can do is fire them when that happens. The number of scenarios and challenges is limited and the goal is incomplete, and not visible to review while you are playing the game.I was thrilled about the concept when I first started playing it, but that has worn off. It would be great if the makers of Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 created this game, then we would at least know that it would work well.Don't waste your money on this one!"
1,Good idea but a boring game,"I like the idea of a business sim but this was boring. It was hard to figure out for one thing and then once you figure it out it's boring and you wish you hadn't invested the time to learn to play it. Then you wish you hadn't invested the money in the game at all and you're generally depressed. Plus the graphics are incredibly boring, low-res and bad. Some sim designers must think that sims don't need good looking graphics so they cut the budget there but actually good graphics enhance gameplay even for a sim."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is one of the most disappointing games ever. The graphics are terrible, it's like something out of the early 80s when people didn't really know how to make great computer games yet. Don't waste your money or your time. I love tycoon games, and this one was awful."
2,not worth your money,dear person who is making a bad mistake about buying this game i just want to say this i have had my share o simulation games and this is one of the worst one for one thing the grafics are nothing like what the box tells you and the only fun thing about it is that you can make a mall and you always go bankrupt in 2 seconds! now think about it do you really want a game like the one i just discribed?.................i thought so!
3,An awesome idea...bad creation,"I bought Mall Tycoon expecting a lot. I mean, you can do a lot when you create a game like this. But, I was disappointed. Sure, you can choose what KIND of things your stores sell...but do you really get to arrange the merchandise and stuff like that? Heck no. There's really not that much you CAN do when you create your mall. As someone else said, the game is mostly controlled by the computer. Also, the graphics are pretty bad. The game is done so that you have 3D view of everything, (which is cool), but ""everything"" is not good quality.Basically, this game might SOUND cool, (and it could be if another company created it), but don't waste your money."
2,Pretty Boring...,"There is a reason why this game is very cheap. Its because it is BORING!! In order to build anything, the game has to be paused, so to make a profit, you have to sit there and watch your people walk around and buy stuff, which gets boring after a while. Bank robbers steel all your money, punks destroy your mall, and zombies turn all your people into more zombies. In order to stop them, you need cops and maintanence workers, but they always get stuck and there is no way to get them out. Take my advice,its a bore. Don't buy it."
1,Sloppy Shopping,"This game is the slopiest game I have ever played. All the stores and everything you can create is so ugly. Like the statues are really wacko looking. I relly think the people who created this game need to re-do it! Because it makes people think who play this: ""if mall tycoon isn't good then the other tycoons aren't either"" I think it is a really bad game! I hate it! And if I could give it a zero I would!"
2,One of the poorest tycoon-type games,"I enjoy sim and tycoon games, notably the Sims series, the Transport Tycoon and Airport Inc. Simulation of a mall is also a nice idea but this Take2's production has significant flaws making the game simply unplayable. The biggest problem is user interface, complicated menu and difficult way of constructing the mall facilities. There is a potential in this simulation but the current retail version should not have been released in my opinion. Do not waste your time and money on this one."
1,Mall Tycoon is soooooooo hard to understand!!!,Mall tycoon is so hard to understand and boring!And my Mom is so confused about this gamebecause it's too confusing.To my opinion Rollercoaster tycoon is way better!!!!!
1,"Poorly Set-up, Poorly everything","I was excited when I was at the window of my local Electronic Botique store, but I was dissapointed when I tried to play the game. The game would freeze and come back to the desktop and what poorly graphics they have. Not a dependable game to buy. Each one of it will have a problem. It is not the best simulator game but has a great hook to getting you the game.1. POORLY GRAPHICS------2.POORLY DONE-----3. FREEZING TRIED IT ON ALL OF MY COMPUTERS!!---------"
2,Mouse Trouble,"Love Simulation Games but this one really slows down the mouse. It skips and jumps so much you don't know where you are at. When you try to get to the toolbar on the right side, it makes the game scroll as well so you keep going back and forth, back and forth, it's very frustrating. (I have never had this trouble with any other simulation games.)"
1,Mess Mall,"The real problem with Mall Tycoon, is the fact that it is not very interactive as far as gaming goes. You purchase store space of different types and then watch your customers go inside them.When you open up a store, in your mall, you will notice that it already has a customer preloaded with the store! Sometimes you will see the same animations in a loop, like a kid jumping on top of a bed mattress or playing with toys in a toy store. you can place maintanance and security guards and all they do is walk around doing their loop animations. You cannot set paths for the workers- they just roam around like fools. You cannot purchase items for the stores, or choose the layout design inside them. Everything is premade and non-interactive=non fun. The music, sound and graphics and animations were very poorly done. Do not buy this game."
4,Not as bad as people say,"So what if Mall Tycoon has a bad rap, well I have the game and it is truly fun. It's graphics aren't great, but they aren't awful. And once you get the hang of the game there are a ton of options of things for your mall. I have only been playing this game for about a week and my mall's huge. I have over 200 k already. I must admit I thought the game wasn't so good at first, but all it takes to play is some know how. I recommend for those of you that just skip over reading the instructions to actually read them because they will really help you. All in all once you get the hang of this game it is really fun."
2,A great game to play when you are bored with nothing else to do.,"I used the cheats on this game also. That was the only way I could come close to enjoying this game.If you can purchase this game at fifty cent's or less, it's a good deal. Don't pay anything over that price. It's not worth it."
1,This game should be illegal!!!,"This game was definitely the worst Tycoon game ever! I suggest for you to either stick with the originals, such as: Roller Coaster Tycoon 1-3, zoo Tycoon, or any others that you are sure are good quality. In this game, the graphics are just awful, and it is completely confusing! It is also very boreing...you do almost nothing! So far, at the price of less than a dollar, you could maybe buy them as cheap gifts that will instantly become re-gifts. All i can say about this posotively is that the packageing is suitable. Though you can tell how poor of quality it is by concentrating on some of the graphics. (I must say again how awful they were.) Seriously, don't buy it! You're a mouse-click away from the most horribly awful game ever to be out on the market!!! This game should be illegal!!!"
2,Ok...,"This game is ok. You can build your dream mall, but only 3 stories. After you build a store, you have to set it just right or customers will think that it is overpriced. Sometimes, zobies or ailens will come and invade your mall, leaving the mall deserted so you have to start over. The grapics are pretty bad. The walls of stores look like cardboard and the people all look alike with unrealistic colors and with set patterns. If you are the kind of person who doesn't care about graphics and likes building things, then this is the game for you!"
3,Where's the music come from?,"I just got this game at a yard sale. It's ok. I can see how one would easily get bored with it. What I want to know is; where does the music come from? I mean, my background music is ""Hot Mama"" by Trace Adkins, and all the net says about the music is it goes from jazz to funk. Mine's country! Does it search your hard drive for MP3's? Any ideas?"
1,Don't waste your $10,"* Game Crashes with XP* Generic stores and blah staff* Put your money towards a better sim game* Didn't expect another Sim-City or Sims, but this game is thoroughly disappointing. No wonder its so cheap, but for its quality, it is still overpriced."
1,The worst game ever...,"I received this game for Christmas, and I was very disappointed in the graphics and the game play. It's the worst tycoon game ever. I can't my family payed full price for this tycoon reject. Roller coaster Tycoon, Airline Tycoon, Sim city, Zoo Tycoon, etc, all have great game play and is very addictive, unlike this game.On the box it says, ""A completely 3D world."" That is total false, it's basically has 8-bit graphics (the type of graphics that were on the super Nintendo video game consoles.)Another problem I have faced was that the game crashed a lot! You have to save frequently, and it takes forever to save. It's just like The Sims, it take 2 minutes to save! I loaded this game on my Windows 2000 and would crash when you got to the preloader. Then I bought a Windows XP and it would crash every 30 to 60 minutes.I hope I made an impact on your decision not to buy this game it's not worth the money and it has many flaws. If you want to just try the game buy it used."
1,"Looks fun, but it really isn't","When I first saw this game, it looked like it would be fun to play, so I got it. When I started playing it however, it wasn't fun at all. Instead of making money, you always lose money because of maintenance costs and payment for employees. No matter what you do, you'll always lose money every month. Also, if the place isn't totally clean, aliens and zombies come. This game is one of the worst Tycoon games I've ever played."
1,Ugh......no.,"All i have 2 say about this game is that it is a good idea but the graphics, sound and gameplay leave much to be desired."
3,Maybe...,"At first this game really rocks (espeacily if you have lots of money). BUt later when there are more people, the graphics get bad. It takes 15 minutes for everything to load! If you don't get frusterated or impatient easily (i.e. waiting three hours to get a bowl of ice cream), then this game is totally for you. It's very interesting, and if you know the cheats, it's even more interesting and fun. To summarize it, it would have been such a marvelous game if it didn't take so long for everything to load."
4,OK,"I GOT IT FOR CRISTMAS. IT WAS SOOO COOL! BUY NOW I'M TIED OF IT. I'M THINKING OF SELLING IT. SO OVER ALL IT WAS OK. BUT IT IS WIERD.... ALIENS ATACK....ZOMBIES KILL YOUR PEOPLE.....AND OTHER STUPID STUFF. I GUSS I RECAMEND YOU BUY IT, BUT YOU WILL TIER OF IT IN A MONTH OR 2"
2,OKAY,Well one of my friends bought this game. Its REALLY stupid. first you build like the stores and put the shops in them. Then u put in the enterence and nobody comes in even if you push the button. try not to waste your money on this game!
1,Avoid this Mall at all costs,"After Rollercoaster Tycoon's success, there have been an enormous amount of games with the ""Tycoon"" name. These games are trying to cash in on the success of Rollercoaster Tycoon and nearly every game has been an utter failure. Mall Tycoon is no exeption....The interface is horrendous, it involves a random assortment of multi-colored buttons for various tasks. There is no cohesions to the interface whatsoever. The graphics are very bad, and the game runs very poorly, often slowing down or crashing on fast systems.In addition to a multitude of other flaws, and those listed above, the game just doesn't work. The concept is a novel one, unfortunately Take2 released a bomb here. Even the...price doesn't justify the horrible game, avoid this mall at all costs!"
2,13 years old:,"There are a lot of better games on the market than this one, but there isn't anything wrong with it really, other than that the graphics aren't up to date."
2,WHAT?,"This game is kind-of a joke for what it promises. The interface is VERY confusing and yet the graphics so simple. The guest intelligence is very stupid level.I really played it once, cause it dosen't work on one of my computers (it crashes!)Not recommended to buy. Try a free online demo. They have those for nearly any game. Be forewarned not to expect what the box will tell you, or the ads, because it just dosen't stack up."
1,not happy with mall tycoon,"I am not happy because I thought it was going to be a fun game,like zoo tycoon and coaster tycoon but it's boring."
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!,"Horrible. Just horrible. UNlike other tycoon gmaes, this one sucks. You build a mall, and stores. But they're empty stores. Your supposed to find someone to rent it out, but nothing happens. It is very hard to naviget, and the graphics are slow. Takes forever to install, and then when playing, it takes forever to start up. Don't waste your money...get Ski Resort Tycoon instead."
2,Indeed a very sad day for Take 2 Interactive (game creators),"Well when i saw this game, i thought oh wow! U can build ur own mall and its from the same guy that made Roller Coaster Tycoon! ya right! The ""TYCOON"" disieved me and now I'm mad i bought this game. It wasnt too much money, but i shoulda saved it for this Cd i wanted! The graphics are pretty bad. Everythin is pretty bad. I opened my mall, and all these burgalurs entered and thats all the ppl i saw!! After all the stuff i said was against this game, I gave it 2 stars because it still is fun to play it from time to time."
1,Don't Do It,"If you are a fan of some of the better simulation games, like the SimCity series, or even Tropico, etc., don't buy this game. The graphics are substandard, the gameplay is boring and unimaginative, and the interface is less than intuitive. This game is a blatant attempt to cash in on the reputation of some of the more succesful and better-made tycoon games."
2,The fun lasted me for about 30 minutes...,"Great concept, yet it was tourn apart by the terrible programming. The controls are hard to get used to, and the animation is poor. They messed up how the mall should be made. It should have been that people came in and asked you to put their store in, but you have to create each of them. All though this is a good point, it's also one of the bad ones. I hate the animation, because the customers don't look like they buy anything.Word of advice to the makers of this game: Think a bit more before you go and ruin something as cool of a concept as this. There could have been so many more options and better graphics as well as sounds."
1,extremely disappointing tycoon,"This game is not as good as it looks like on the box. For the money, The Sims is much better. There are known bugs in this software that cause the game to crash and lose all of it's settings. No patches have came out to improve the game or fix the bugs, and tech support is basically non-existant. Steer clear if you are looking for a good simulation game. You'll end up with a headache instead."
2,very boring!!,"i have every tycoon ever made and this is the worst. the graphics are bad the installing is hard and you need to be like an expert to make a good mall. its just too hard. but it does have good stores like cloths for girls or boys and toys. but some stores are bad like the bikinie place, you see the people trying on bikinies, and you see a fat man with no shirt getting a tattue. and you hardlley gain money so you have to start over. if you are looking for a safe and fun tycoon game you should get zoo tycoon 2 or roller coaster tycoon 3 i have em and i love em!!!!"
1,Don't waste your money like I did,"I saw Mall Tycoon in a store one day, and it looked intriguing. I have enjoyed SimCity and RollerCoaster Tycoon, so I thought this would be a good choice.I was quite wrong. Mall Tycoon was one of the worst game purchases I have ever made. The game is fun for less than half an hour.The gameplay is the same thing over and over again. Build stores, get people to come to the stores, build some more stores, get some more people. There is little variety in the different stores you can build, and the less-than-stellar graphics didn't improve my opinion of the game. Placing stores and different objects in the mall is an awkward and difficult process.Every mall looked like the next, and there was nothing unique that made you want to continue playing. This game was a total loss.I uninstalled it shortly after buying it, and it has sat in a far corner of my closet ever since. If you buy this game, you will regret it."
1,BORING!,"My first tycoon game was Zoo Tycoon and it is a complete blast!! So I was hoping for the same with Mall Tycoon. No such luck. I can basically echo the sentiments from other reviews; poor graphics and sound, not much interaction and the tutorial stinks. A few more specifics that I didn't like were; there isn't an undo button which I really appreciate in Zoo Tycoon. And there isn't a goals list when you are playing the scenario scene so you can see what you need to accomplish. I would not reccomend buying this game at all."
2,Give me more to do,"I dont own this game and im glad that i dont. I was playing it at a relatives house and it took me almost an hour to figure it out. its not that its hard its that there are too many controls and you get mixed up. Then, when you finally build your mall, its not fun! The people come in, by 1 thing and then leave. you can click on the person and over 80% of the time their little box says ""leaving mall"". Their is no point! Also, sometimes you get burgulers and the only way to stop them is to have cops around, but you cant control the cops so you have to buy a lot of them and spend more money! You have to research everything to get it. Workers, New events, new stores etc. Its frustrating! If you are going to buy it i wouldnt play for long periods of time. Some parts are fun if you get an atrium and have differnt events like kite shows and dog shows whatever."
1,You can't judge a book by its cover,"I recently bought this Mall Tycoon game and was not very pleased. The front cover graphics are much better than its actual graphics. This game takes a long time to load each time you play. Also, it is not nearly as fun as Zoo Tycoon. I was playing mall tycoon and was doing well, when all of a sudden these alien things came in and destroyed what I had worked hours on - I was very angry. Unfortunetly, I do not recommend this game."
5,This game rocks!,"Look,i know all of you are expiriencing problems,but that dosen't mean that it's a waste of money,it is the system requirements that count.System Requierements is the first thing you need to look in any PC program.The SR are on the bottom or back side of the box.If your computer does not accept those,that's why the game is not working properly.These are the system requirements for Mall Tycoon,Lemonade Tycoon and the #1 Roller Coaster Tycoon 2!:100% PC CompatibleOS:Windows 98/Me/2000/XPCPU:Pentium II 300 MHz proccesor or higher.Ram:64MB RAM(128 MB recommended)CD ROM-8X(10 min to load)45X(2 min to load)90X(30 sec.to load)Hard Drive Space Needed=300 MBInput devices=Microsoft compatible keyboard and mouse.Video Card:16MB Direct 3D Video Card(32MB recommended for high performance.)Sound Card:DirectSupportYou need to folow the SR to know that it is YourPC Compatible.Thanks!"
2,Wasted Money,"At first i thought this game was really cool, from all the ads that have been posted on the net....but when my sis bought it for me..n i tried the game...i knew that she had wasted her money...totally!Look, the graphics n sounds r horrible...the poeple look like they r sliding around sum times n i the game play is not really good too. The overall quality of the game disappoints me. Im heading to buy roller coaster tycoon soon...cos i tried the demo n it rules! Much better than this game, surely."
3,Not quite a winner!,"Overall, it's a fun game to play, but the graphics are extremely poor, especially when compared to older sim games. The game is good amuesment for a few weeks, but it's definetly not one of those games you play forever. This company tends to produce great concepts but they are unable to bring them to life as well as some of the other simulation devlopers. But hey, for ($) you can't be too picky."
2,The game is fun,"I have played the free demo, but have not yet bought the game which I am going to do. But I was wondering if Wildlife Park: Wild Creatures only included the wolves. I quite enjoy this game. And think it has copied Zoo tycoon but I don't mind it."
5,awesome,"Wonderful game. Given to our son (5yrs) as a gift. He needed a little help in the beginning, but quickly figured out how to do it himself. He'll come running upstairs asking what certain animals eat and now knows all about plexiglass. It's addictive. We have so much fun doing it together and typically fight over the mouse. He's learning so much about animal habitats as well. We play for fun - he's too young to understand the concept of ""making a profit"". We love it!!!"
1,DONNOT BUY!!!,"I bought this game, in anticipation of it being a really great game, better than Zoo Tycoon, can you believe I had doubt that Zoo TYcoon wasn't the best animal genre tycoon? Got it with a giftcard and was REALLY dissappointed, graphics are not great, everything is complicated, it quikly made me go back to playing Zoo TYcoon and appreciate more. Save your Jackson, not worth it..."
3,Rating,IT DOES NOT TELL YOU THE RATING AND I AM ONLY 11. I WANT TO NOW IF I AM ALOUD TO PLAY THIS GAME. ONCE ON A DIFFERENT WEB SITE IT SAID FOR CHILDREN 12+ AND ANOTHER ONE SAID NR (NOT RATED)

3,Not as big as I was thinking.,"I recently had to put my black cat down. I got this to remember him because the likeness is very similar. The toy is smaller than I thought from looking at the picture, but that is okay. Not something I would return it over. It is the size of beanie baby. It serves the purpose I bought it for."
3,Eyes are screwed up..,"My only complaint is the eyes on the cat I received. They're -really- offset, so much so it reminds me of Sloth in the Goonies...I bought it as part of a Valentine's present for my fiancee cuz he loves black cats [which are hard to find in stores around here]. I thought it'd be a cute idea, but now I'm hesitant to give it to him cuz of the offset eyes on it."
3,For Gadget Fans Only...!,"Unfortunately if you've never experienced the Gadget CD-Rom or have never read either of the books, you're probably going to be pretty lost watching this DVD.I'm one of those people who cannot get enough from Harihuko SHONO's world of Gadget.I only give the DVD 3 stars because I really feel the previous incarnations of Gadget are much better. The DVD basically takes you on a ""Sensorama Trip"" and starts losing steam towards the end. The last three parts seem to center around the aftermath of the Comet hitting the earth and watching twenty-five minutes of surreal swamp, whirling lights and swirling liquid got sort of boring.Too bad he didn't actually make an actual CGI Movie with dialogue and story based on the books!"
2,CAUTION! Gadget Trips: Mindscapes may not be what you think,"I have been a big fan of Odyssey's computer animation videos since the The Mind's Eye; however, I am disappointed with Gadget Trips: Mindscapes because it is definitely not what I expected. Although Gadget Trips does have good animation, it is nothing more than continuous dreary, hallucinogenic Cold War-type imagery with mildly disturbing incidental music in the background. I felt like I was watching a bad dream, and it left me feeling somewhat depressed. It gave me the same feeling as watching one of David Lynch's more bizarre films like Eraserhead or Lost Highway. While some people may find this gloomy experience interesting, it is definitely not for everyone. If you are looking for a movie with a plot, or cheerful CGI with vivid colors for the kids, stay away from this title! It is very much unlike anything Odyssey has released before."
1,I can't believe Melinda Metz has allowed this!,"This series is apalling! I read the series Roswell High, by Melinda Metz, and was ecstatic when i found out they were making a tv show out of it. Well, after about two shows, i was sooo angry! They completely destroyed the entire story! These books are based on a bad tv show that is based on some awesome books. I don't understand why Melinda Metz would allow such a monstrosity to be connected to her series. This is completely ridiculous, and if you consider yourself a fan of all this, I highly suggest you read the real story, the one that was stolen and mutilated. It's far better than anything these ...wanna-be-writers could come up with. I only gave this a star because i had to in order to write the review."
3,Works well but you need enough for a wide area,"I bought this to remove some of the stains and spots from a sofa I was trying to sell. The sofa was microfiber and didn't have any overt stains, but just some general dirt from years of use. It works well, but I wouldn't recommend it for small spot usage. The problem was that it cleaned almost too well because it left a clean spot on my sofa cushions. It was the equivalent of repainting a door panel on a car without blending it with the original car paint on the surrounding panels. It was just really obvious (and ugly) what spots were cleaned and what was not. The only way to make the the sofa look normal was to apply this everywhere in order to get an even stain removal.Also, wear a mask when using this. It has a strong chemical smell that I can't imagine is good for you."
4,K2r replacement,I was looking for K2r a european cleaner spray that removes greasy stains out of garmnet and transfers it to the starch it contains. Well no more K2r probable the european environs killed it!This product is about the same and cheaper too! You still get edges around the old grease stain and need to wash the garment!!
2,remote doesn't work,"I received the unit in a few days. The switch is working manually by pushing the button to change input from various devices. However, the remote controller didn't work following the instruction. I had a hardware electric engineer check the battery and all components of the switch. We couldn't fix the problem, so I returned it."
3,Nice product but I didnt read the fine print,"I received Startech Switch and I assumed (never assume) that it had a coax out, which is what I needed it for. Long story short...The product is solid and well built and shipping was very fast.I didn't return this as I have a feeling I will need this in the near future with my Home Entertainment Center being mentally assembled [grin]"
4,Works just fine,"I was a little unsure at first because I had never heard of StarTech before, but they didn't disappoint. The product works great and the remote is a nice feature. Its small enough to keep hidden out of the way and the remote has decent range and good response.I'd recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a cheap 4 to 1 AV Switch."
4,Good for S-Video and Composite Sharing,"If you're like me and you have more video to input into your home theater than ports available, you probably need one of this. This obviously isn't HD compatible since it lacks either component or HDMI. However, I have a security DVR, Video iPod and Sony Camcorder which all do no better than S-Video. Since I can't spare an open input on my Home Theater Receiver for each of these gadgets, this handy switch is the best way to share them. The remote capability is essential. Once you use the included remote to program your universal remote, it becomes trivial to switch between camcorders, iPods, Satellite TV, DVD, etc."
5,Incredible buy!,"For less than $25 shipped, this product has far exceeded my expectations! I have 3 components connected to it and I have the output connected to an RF modulator allowing me to feed these 3 sources (that are located in my basement) via coax to a TV in the bedroom, one floor above. My learning remote easily learned the 4 input buttons from the supplied remote allowing me to switch easily between sources. Control of the device from my bedroom, as well as the other sources, is accomplished with theNext Generation Remote Control Extender. I couldn't be happier with my purchase, it's an excellent product....and again, the price was unbeatable!"
3,"Decent switch, bad remote","I bought this switch to connect my video game systems and TiVo to my old TV's pathetic one input.The switch worked fine. It switched between all the sources without issue. And having four inputs is very useful! One minor complaint, but it may just be my TV, and not the switch. When I connect both the composite out and the S-Video out to the TV, the TV always tries to use the composite, rather than the S-Video, even when there's no signal on the composite. My solution was to buy cheap composite to S-video adapters for the devices that didn't have S-Video out, and just use S-Video for everything.The remote never worked, from day one. No matter how I pointed it, it wouldn't change the input on the box. But, I have a Logitech Harmony remote, which supports this switch, so I didn't really need the remote, anyway."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in the accuracy of this pedometer. Unless it is worn perfectly level, it does not count steps. I find myself trying to hold it straight on my waist, so that it will count. I have worn it while on an elipitical machine at the gym and it will count half the steps that the machine will count."
4,very nice book indeed!,"Okri's tale is to do with finding inner peace, self discovery and urges the reader to grasp and live life. It places the soul above all else in terms of importance. It is ironic that the journey's initial aim was to take away the main character's feelings of insignificance and 'invisibility'. The reader soon becomes aware that things that are invisible are the most beautiful. That love, faith and sacrifice are much more meaningful than aything we can see or touch. This is just one of the themes - for me, there is much to read into this beautiful book, its biggest achievement is that it really is open for interpretation and can be read on many levels."
5,An Astonishing Journey,"This is a truly Wonderful book, one of my personal favourites. It is rich in spirituality and teachings. Okri's thoughts on creativity, knowledge, understanding and searching were so powerful and insightful, I felt my myself enriched by simply reading his words."
1,Skip This Book,"I have recently read Dangerous Love by Ben Okri, which was a stunning novel-the writing and imagery was superb. I thought Astonishing the Gods was just the opposite. The writing was abysmal, contrived, silly--I had to force myself to get through it, kept waiting for it to turn around. It brought to mind the worst of B novels. I couldn't believe the same author had written both of these books. In fact I still can't believe it.I say skip it and go directly to his other works."
3,What NO song LIST!!!,I would like to KNOW what is on this set. And I'm sure other people would TOO. I don't think people are going to buy this if they don't know whats on it.
5,Heart-breaking and mind-provoking,"For anyone with a loved one or good friend who has suffered from mental illness, The Angel and the Dragon is a fascinating but difficult read. Jonathan Aurthur's tale of his son's mental illness and suicide is heart-breaking. His research into the mental health profession/industry is, at once, a revelation and revulsion. The reader cannot escape Aurthur's pain and frustation as he attempts to help guide his son through difficult psychotic episodes. That frustation becomes compounded as Aurthur researches doctors and the drug industries in an attempt to figure out what is wrong with his son and how to abate it if not cure it.This book is not an easy one to read but it leaves you with a feeling of gratitude that you did."
3,"It does its job, but no pain, no gain...","I've had this product for a couple of months, and I've found that it is an excellent tool for toning my core muscles, and getting my shoulders in better shape. I did however have one big problem with the product - the handles. They are shaped for handgrips, but are rock hard, so I ended up with blisters on my hands every time I used it. Now I wear 30 gram winter gloves to add some more cushioning until I manage to find some type of foam to pad it with. The ab wheels with foam handle pads might be a few dollars more expensive, but you may find it to be worth the cost."
4,Good product,"I was reading somewhere that boxers use these things for training, and the idea first started out as a lawnmower wheel with a bar through it, but for $11 the Ironman ab wheel is a great buy for the results. I've only had it for 2 weeks and you can tell its already working. The ironman ab wheel is nice, sturdy and simple. I gave it a 4 stars because the grips are a little hard so it can hurt your hand after long periods of use. Also it doesn't come with extensive instructions on use or anything so what I did was hit up youtube and watched how it should be used because with ill use it can hurt your back badly. All in all though I would recommend this to someone else. This, cardio and eating right will give you a nice stomach as your reward."
4,Better than sit ups.,"Why waste your time and injure your back doing sit ups? Just do two or three sets with this and get it over with. Much better on the back and a way better work out on the stomach--not easy to do, but do what you can and you'll feel the affects. There is certainly nothing fancy about this particular product, but there doesn't need to be."
4,pretty good for the price,I liked this product well enough. The tread on the wheel had decent gription which allowed for controlled movements.
3,"It is what it is, but why is it so stinky?","It's a simple ab wheel, works as expected but it has this gnarly rubber/grease smell that hasn't gone away after months of ownership."
2,Cannot get a workout from this,"Just as one reviewer mentioned before, I am getting no workout with my abs using this. It seems the majority of reviews are positive for these types of devices, so I would guess that I'm somehow using it wrong. The instructions are fairly simple. Sit on your knees, raise up, and roll the wheel across and then pull it back. How this gets your abs engaged is a mystery to me. My arms were getting a workout because they had to support my weight at the end of the extension. My back partially felt some stress as well. I tried multiple ways of using this device, but no matter how many times I tried, my abs never felt stressed."
3,Did nothing for me,"Did this for 2-3 weeks about 10 a day but noticed no change in my stomach shape or toning. Just gave me stronger arms, so I haven' used it anymore."
1,Don't buy,This was not a good product. It didn't work like the first one I had that finally broke. The ones with the braking mechanism are the best to buy. My back didn't hurt and I lost weight in my abs using the first one I had. This one did absolutely NOTHING for me. I would recommend NOT buying this product.
5,Best Price/quality,Works great. Combine with some other product to get free shipping and it is yours for few bucks.
4,Great For Beginners,"I am a beginner. The videos on the disk help to show you how to play what they are teaching. It allows you to skip around, so if you prefer to learn a certain chord or style, you can jump to it. I had no problems loading it or learning to use it. Very user friendly, with little need for a manual."
1,Be forwarned this does not work on Vista,"I suppose it is unfair to give this a one star for not working on Vista, as it does not claim to. This program is 16 bit, which means even on Windows XP it has to use the NTVDM.exe (the virtual machine) and that can cause problems and the video will never be great.Not everyone will have problems but watch out."
3,"Great, but the movie was better","I read the book only because I loved the movie. I expected the book to contain more storyline and depth, but I was terribly disappointed in finding that the movie in fact was by far, more informative. The book itself was very original: comparing a quilt to love and life. It's blend of fiction and non-fiction was done successfully by Otto. However, one thing that lacked in Otto's book was a main character. It seemed that there were numerous supporting characters, and an attempt to create the main character Finn, and yet Finn had the least lines out of all of them. If more info and depth was written about Finn, then Otto's book would have been as successful as the movie. However, because it lacked in this factor, I was majorly disappointed and gave it only 3 stars when it deserved 5."
4,very good novel,"I saw the movie, How to make an American Quilt, a long time ago and then it was shown on tv. I really liked the movie, even the second time seeing it, so I decided to read the book. Wow, the book was just as good as the movie, actually a lot better! I dissagree with the review that says that the book was geered towards a certain type of people because I definately am not a 60 year old lady who lives in a small town but I still enjoied the book a lot. I loved all of the little lessons I learned from it. I definately reccomend this book to anyone and everyone."
2,As Dull as a Darning Needle,"Directions on how to make a quilt stitch the patches of a community's quilt-makers' lives together. An interesting concept. If only the short stories, the tales of the ladies sitting at the quilting frame, were interesting. Unfortunately they're about as dull as a straight stitch.I expected the stories of Finn, Glady Jo, Hy, Anna Neale and the others to be joined with intricate stitches, with rich fabrics; to flow much like the pieces they stitch togehter once a week. Instead they are seperate scraps joined simply by the thread of ""belonging."" They are connected simply because they get together once a week to quilt.I guess I expected another PERSIAN PICKLE CLUB, or maybe it was the ""short story"" aspect that attracted me, but I was disappointed. I suppose I should have paid closer attention to the metaphor in the ""directions"" before each story."
4,The characters invite you into their homes,"After reading this book, I had the desire to spend time bonding with my female friends. There is a bond between women, that no male no matter how close he is to his woman can ever completely understand. I loved the interspersed chapters about quilting. They were very interesting and provided insight. The problem is this book had too many characters. It was hard to keep them all straight. It might have done better to focus on just a few of the characters and look at things from their perspective. A chapter on each female character just wasn't sufficient. Extra-marital affairs seemed to be experienced in one way or the other by nearly every character"
1,...a severe overdose of semiotic bulldust!,"This is one of the rare examples where the movie was better than the book.....much much much better infact! Whitney Otto fails in her attempts to intertwine meanings and subliminal thoughts (and an actual story line).....with the construction of a quilt. If you want an in-depth step-by-step instruction manual (peppered with ludicrous dialogue, flashbacks and scenarios) ....this may be the book for you....but if your're like me - who has never even accomplished the simple task of sewing a hankerchief...let alone a quilt........watch the movie!"
1,Novels should not be listed with crafts!!!!!,"""How to make an American Quilt""is misleading for the novice trying to learn to quilt! This book should be listed with novels, not crafts!"
2,Unless you're a quilter....,"Whitney Otto's How To Make An American Quilt is an interesting, but slow story. This very short book has alternating chapters of people then quilting instructions. There is a parallel between the instructional chapters and those of the quilter that she describes in the following chapter. Over all I did not enjoy this book because I did not care about the characters. An unfaithful husband, a cool wife, a woman who sleeps with their sister's husband, and the like just do not hold my interest as someone I am concerned with. When there were but 50 pages left in the book I found a character I did enjoy. The instructional chapters were tedious. Thankfully it is well written."
2,Plowed through the sentimentality,"How To Make an American Quilt was NOT a particularly enjoyable read for me, even though some of the sexier chapters appealed...I hated the quilting instructions that used YOU statements directed to married women unlike myself, I was frustrated by the stiff structure of the book and the way that every character had a separate chapter (it's a cop-out way to write!) My grandmother gave it to me for my 12th? birthday and I think HTMAAQ can only be fully appreciated by women of a different era. However, I think Whitney Otto is a talented writer and I liked some parts of the book. It's definitely aimed at a specific type of reader, though, so if you live in a small town where there are quilting circles that meet once a week or if you are a woman over the age of 60, GO FOR IT!"
5,Beautiful detail.,"I purchased this as a gift during Christmas for my baby, and she absolutely loves it. The detail is incredible, very life like, down to the spots. It is made of great material, very solid. The price is great, and the delivery was fast. I recommend it."
4,Just what I wanted,"I ordered this watch because I had had one previously and it performed well for me. (I ruined much of the original case by spraying it with bugspray...Don't subject this type of casing to anything like that!) I was looking for an inexpensive watch to wear scuba diving and for other water sports. The watch has performed to 80' so far, and stands up to considerable abuse. It's a bit clunky, and I would like to see a slightly smaller version for women, but I love it for outdoor activites."
5,Gardena 31926-12 Shower/Spray Gun,"Even though I wasn't a big gardener at the time and I found it a bit hard to justify the costlier price, I bought one of these spray guns over 8 years ago and it still works like brand new. Other guns cost less and don't last or perform anywhere near this one. You can shut the spray off, lock it on, hold it on, adjust the intensity of the spray anywhere from a dribble to very strong and the head very easily adjusts to the different types of spray. I have never had this gun leak or clog up. Since I keep my Gardena for use in my front yard, I've recently been looking to buy another one for the back yard since the cheaper guns I've been using keep leaking or breaking. I love it!"
4,love these...,"They are cheaper in your local store but I like them so much that I figured spending the few extra bucks wasn't a big deal. Great tasting, with almond butter, peanut butter, etc...or, just eat them plain!"
4,A Wonderful Story!,"I don't usually read westerns and have never read a Lori Copeland book, so I was wonderfully surprised when I couldn't put this book down! It was witty, action-packed and just an all around cute page turner of a love story. Amelia is very funny and I love that in a book. I like humor more than anything else! And what I liked about it most was that I didn't feel like I was reading a porno book when it came to the actual love scenes, matter of fact if you are looking for the sizziling sex scenes that some other books have pass this one up, because there are none, it is just a good love story, and I for one loved it!"
2,The book lists items found in Etrusia but gives no analysis,"Granted there's not a lot known about the Etrusians; but rather than analyze what's been found about these people and give some insight as to how they lived, why they came to prominence and then why they faded almost into oblivion, the author lists and lists what was found in the tombs. However, you'll find excellent maps of the cities but overall it's laborious to read. The Time-Life series is much more interesting and overall more informative for a non Archeological student. How many times can you say that?"
5,A great guide for bookstore lovers,"""Bookstore Tourism"" is a very interesting read that makes a strong case in support of indie booksellers. It addresses the competition between small, independent bookshops and the larger chain stores and internet merchants. It also gives numerous examples of how to organize bookstore trips with friends or with an organization or school. It's a great way to meet other book-lovers and to spend a day shopping at excellent bookshops that you might not be familiar with in another town. Mr. Portzline does a great job of spelling out how to organize such trips and why they benefit independent bookstores. It's a fantastic idea and a lot of fun! The book is enjoyable to read as well. If you love books, you can't go wrong with something like this."
5,A truly original idea,"""Bookstore Tourism"" is a great little book and an even better idea. The book delves into why it's so important to support indie bookstores, and how they're fighting for their lives against the large retail chains, not just B&N and Borders but WalMart and basically any other major conglomerate that sells books. The ideas in the book are great and very helpful, telling people how to go about planning road trips with friends and other groups to towns with excellent independent bookstores. It's an interesting, enjoyable read and I highly recommend it. My only criticism is that it's too short and the author should expand it and do even more with the idea. When is Bookstore Tourism Part 2 coming out like the author hinted?"
4,Insightful!,"The market for ""military metaphor"" leadership books is saturated, but retired Major General William A. Cohen issues a worthy, if not outstanding, addition to the field. It reflects painstaking work by its highly qualified author, a former special ops pilot who has gathered stories from virtually every field of human endeavor to illustrate his leadership principles. Strong in its depth of detailed and inspirational anecdotes, particularly from the annals of military history, this book is less effective at describing how managers specifically can apply its principles to their daily business lives. This is a routine shortcoming of the genre, which tends to offer more shots than targets. We recommend this book to managers and executives seeking inspiration, rather than specific business advice, and to leaders who enjoy military history and vivid war stories."
3,Interesting but fell short ...,"Love leadership books and love and admire our special ops guys but this one didnt do it for me. Has good points but its one more attempt by someone, this time military, to make the leap to business and while there is some crossover I just find the examples when it comes to business pie in the sky. it will play with from General to CEO but the troops know better. And there are more special ops than the Air Force ... disappointing but if you like special ops stories they're okay but leave it out of business please at this level anyway"
